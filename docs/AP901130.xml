   Smithsonian Institution curators are busy
cataloguing a monumental new collection of nearly 200 years of
popular American sheet music, including stacks of rare,
long-forgotten Broadway melodies by George Gershwin and Irving
Berlin.
   This bonanza from the nation's musical past, a gift from Fort
Wayne, Ind., broadcaster Sam deVincent, consists of 130,000
original editions of illustrated sheet music, nearly 20,000
recordings and boxes of posters, concert programs, newspaper
clippings and other memorabilia.
   ``This is one of the great, legendary collections of sheet music
in the world,'' said John Edward Hasse, curator of American music
at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. ``It
contains some of the rarest of the rare.''
   The scope of the deVincent collection is staggering. It ranges
from yellowing reprints of parlor piano pieces of the 1790s to
mournful Civil War ballads, the shameless bigotry of minstrel show
music, railroad songs and ragtime, military marches, antiwar
protest songs, Beatles favorites and political campaign choruses.
   The bulk of the collection focuses on the golden era of Tin Pan
Alley, from the 1890s to the 1940s, when Gershwin, Berlin, Cole
Porter and other great songwriters were churning out Broadway show
tunes.
   Scores of large cartons in the museum's archives are stuffed
with their most memorable hits and some of their most forgettable
words and lyrics.
   Among the latter is a 1919 Gershwin song titled
``Tee-Oodle-Um-Bum-Bo'' and a few of Hoagy Carmichael's obscure
World War II morale boosters, including ``I'm a Cranky Old Yank in
a Cranky Old Tank ...''
   Berlin wrote ``I'm the Guy Who Guards the Harem (And My Heart's
in My Work)'' for the Ziegfeld Follies of 1919. And little
remembered from his 1933 hit musical, ``Easter Parade,'' is a song
titled ``I Say It's Spinach.''
   As America sang deeper into the Depression, Berlin wrote:
   ``Things don't come on a silver platter,
   ``What does it matter,
   ``Long as there's you, long as there's me,
   ``Long as the best things in life are free,
   ``I say it's spinach,
   ``The hell with it, the hell with it, that's all!''
   Hasse says the deVincent collection, a rich and diverse
repository of Americana, will give historians an intimate portrait
of the nation's cultural tastes and social upheavals over the past
two centuries.
   No fewer than 500 songs give testimony to America's love affair
with the automobile. Others trace the rise of labor unionists,
suffragettes and abolitionists. Popular songs toasted Charles
Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, lamented the Titanic's
sinking and poked fun at peculiarities of East European immigrants.
   Cover illustrations document the rise and fall of fashion styles
and popular dance steps, from Revolutionary-era quadrilles to the
waltz, two-step, cakewalk, ballroom marches, bunny hop and turkey
trot, tango, Charleston, jitterbug and Twist.
   Some of the sheet music covers are decorated with outstanding
examples of the illustrator's art. Winslow Homer, later to gain
fame as a painter and watercolorist, sketched a cover for the 1850s
song ``Kitty Clyde.'' George M. Cohan's patriotic World War I song,
``Over There,'' featured a Norman Rockwell painting of four
doughboys singing around a campfire.
   The collection represents a 60-year labor of love by deVincent,
retired music director of Fort Wayne radio station WOWO, who began
hoarding sheet music as a 12-year-old in Chicago.
   By 1978, while Hasse was writing a doctoral dissertation on
ragtime music at Indiana University, deVincent's collection had
filled his two-car garage and spilled into nearly every room of his
home.
   ``When I saw his ragtime holdings, I was flabbergasted, I was
speechless,'' Hasse said. ``I quickly realized the tremendous value
of his collection, and made a vow to myself that I would try to
help it find a good home someday.''
   Hasse, who joined the Smithsonian in 1984, played a leading role
in negotiating the museum's acquisition of the deVincent
collection, which was shipped to Washington in the spring of 1988
in five truckloads.
   DeVincent says the rarest items in his collection include an
original copy of Berlin's first published song, ``Marie From Sunny
Italy,'' written in 1907, and a first edition of ``Old Zip Coon,''
an 1816 minstrel song that later became known as ``Turkey in the
Straw.''
   Even the eminent Cohan wrote ``coon songs'' for the popular
blackface minstrel shows of his day, Hasse noted.
   ``We may find the lyrics distasteful today,'' he said, ``but it
is important for historians to preserve this material so we can
understand the past and build a better future.''

   A nun won the $13,000, fire-engine-red
sports car raffled off to raise money for a struggling parochial
school.
   As they say, the Lord moves in mysterious ways.
   Sister Rebecca Berghoff, though, returned the Geo Storm with
magnesium wheels to the dealer.
   It's not appropriate ``for a nun to be streaking around in a car
like that,'' the 65-year-old nun said.
   She said she never considered keeping the car, though she did
sit in it for a moment.
   The refund she got will help ease budget problems at the
300-student St. Joseph-Marquette School, where she is principal.
The youngsters sold 32,000 of the $1 tickets for Saturday's
drawing, and the principal bought 30 of them.
   ``All I was hoping for was that it would go to someone we knew,
and someone who needs it,'' she said Thursday.

<HEAD>Kemp Gets High Marks, But HUD Watchdog Still Finds Problems Galore</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp has his agency on
a reform track, but millions of dollars still are wasted because of
management problems, the agency's inspector general says.
   In a report Thursday to Congress, Inspector General Paul A.
Adams gave Kemp high marks for his efforts to clean up the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. The agency was the
subject of a congressional investigation last year following an
Adams report revealing fraud and influence-peddling in a major
rehabilitation program.
   Still, Adams said much more remains to be done to resolve major
problems at HUD headquarters, its regional and field offices across
the country and in many local public housing authorities that get
HUD money and administer many of its programs.
   Adams said his office will take a closer look at Kemp's
performance ``to determine how effective management has been in
correcting previously reported problems.''
   The inspector general's audits often are the first sign of
trouble in HUD programs, but past audits often were ignored by HUD
management. Under Kemp, ``audit follow-up is being pursued more
vigorously than ever,'' Adams said.
   As an example, Adams pointed to swift implementation of new
regulations for HUD's dealings with private closing agents. That
program drew attention during congressional hearings because of the
ease with which some agents stole millions in HUD money, usually
undetected.
   Most of the persistent problems cited by Adams were at local
housing authorities and HUD's field offices, although he also cited
several headquarters deficiencies.
   For example, he said millions of dollars in money for
multi-family housing programs was being misspent or diverted each
year, in many cases because local and federal officials were not
carefully monitoring of government funds.
   Also, Adams said purchases made through a centralized HUD
purchasing program for public housing authorities cost 18 percent
more than if the local agencies had sought competitive bids.
   During a review of the Section 8 public housing program, Adams
said his office found inadequate controls on basic quality
standards for housing. An audit of HUD's Cincinnati field office,
for example, found violations in 82 of 86 units reviewed.
   HUD also is plagued by shoddy data processing, Adams said. One
system made $4 million in duplicate payments to housing authorities
and authorized another $27 million in duplicate payments that were
detected before they were spent.
   Adams said a large share of his office's investigative resources
during April-September were dedicated to FBI and Justice Department
task forces reviewing HUD programs.
   His report made no mention of the independent investigation of
Kemp's predecessor, former Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., by a
court-appointed special prosecutor. The Justice Department sought
the review last year after numerous accounts of mismanagement,
political influence-peddling and waste during Pierce's eight years
as housing secretary. Pierce has denied any wrongdoing.

   A Thai jumbo jet has been forced to
make an unscheduled landing because a copilot caught his leg
between a seat and the instrument panel, authorities said.
   The captain of the Thai Airways Boeing 747 requested the
non-emergency landing Thursday night at the Adelaide airport, Civil
Aviation Authority spokesman John Morris said today.
   Flight 484 was flying from Melbourne to Bangkok with about 300
people on board.
   Airport officials said it appeared the incident happened when
the first and second officers were switching over in a cockpit
seat. The plane's operation was unaffected by the problem because
the captain was in another seat, they said.
   A doctor and an engineer were able to extricate the first
officer. He suffered no injuries but was taken to a nearby hospital
for a checkup. The flight resumed after a two-hour delay.

   The Nag, which means cobra in the Hindi languauge, fully met the

eastern India, United News of India reported.
   The news agency gave no range for the missile, which is designed
and built by Indian scientists. But earlier news reports have put
it at 2{ miles.
   The missile needs more tests before being mass-produced for the
army, the news agency said.

   A 39-year-old police sergeant assigned to security
during the monthlong enthronement ceremonies for Emperor Akihito
has died from overwork, police say.
   The officer, Haruo Okada of Tokyo, died of acute heart failure
after collapsing at home Thursday morning, a city police official
said on condition of anonymity.
   The police official said Okada had taken only two days off from
Oct. 27-Nov. 25 because of the huge security operation for
Akihito's enthronement ceremonies, which began early this month.
Okada worked 26-hour shifts, followed by 20 hours off, until his
death.
   Police believe Okada is the second officer who has died from
overwork related to the enthronement security. A 50-year-old police
officer in Kawasaki, just outside Tokyo, died of overwork while on
duty Oct. 18, the official said.

<HEAD>New Law Gives Border Patrol Right to Arrest Drug Suspects</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is hailing a major new
immigration law for strengthening the power of Border Patrol agents
to arrest criminal aliens, including drug suspects.
   Bush signed the measure Thursday, saying it ``boosts our war on
drugs and crime, allowing us to send back alien offenders who
threaten our streets and who make up nearly a fourth of our federal
prison populations.''
   ``It will help secure our borders - the front lines of the drug
war,'' Bush said.
   Under the measure, the arrest authority for Border Patrol agents
has been expanded from immigration law violations to other crimes,
including suspected drug activity.
   The bill, the first sweeping reform of legal immigration in 25
years, also makes it tougher for criminal aliens to stretch out
their deportations by as many as seven years.
   But critics say the law could actually deprive all aliens - not
just those arrested or convicted of a crime - of their legal
rights. They also question giving more authority to the Immigration
and Naturalization Service, which includes the Border Patrol. They
say the agency is in chaos and should not be trusted with such
sensitive responsibilities.
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, sponsored the provision giving the
nation's 3,800 Border Patrol agents additional arrest authority.
   ``There are 3,800 more people who can arrest drug smugglers than
before,'' Smith said. ``It streamlines operations and saves time.
They do not have to wait to call in a (Drug Enforcement
Administration) agent, and for agents in rural areas, there often
is no DEA agent nearby.''
   Wade Henderson, associate director of the Washington national
office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said the ACLU is
concerned about expanding the INS' authority to enforce federal
criminal statutes.
   He said that is largely because INS agents have not been trained
as thoroughly as other law officers.
   ``The agency itself is in a state of administrative chaos, and
to give INS agents this brand new authority, when it's having
difficulty in enforcing its immigration responsibilities, is
presently a mistake,'' Henderson said.
   Wendy Young, immigration policy associate for the National
Council of La Raza, said she also is concerned about the INS'
expanded powers.
   ``There are enough human rights violations going on the border
as it is,'' she said. ``There is a siege mentality at the border -
INS personnel feel they are under siege and tend to strike back,
and anything that enhances that ability ... is scary.''
   Smith, the ranking Republican on the House's immigration
subcommittee, also sponsored provisions to close loopholes that he
said allow criminal aliens to delay deportation by as long as seven
years. The INS estimates that more than 72,000 aliens will be
arrested annually on drug charges alone, yet in 1988, fewer than
6,000 total criminal aliens were deported, he said.

   Police have seized more than a half ton of cocaine
this week on the Caribbean island of Saint-Martin, in the biggest
sting operation against the drug in French territory, police
sources said Thursday.
   Two local drug traffickers were arrested, the sources said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The identities of the alleged
smugglers were not revealed.
   The record seizure of 1,150 pounds was made during a
``controlled delivery'' in an undercover operation, police sources
said. No other details were immediately available.
   Saint-Martin is a tiny Leeward Island east of Puerto Rico. The
seizure was made in the French part of the island, which is under
dual control of France and the Netherlands.
   The previous largest cocaine seizure in France was 1,038 pounds,
confiscated Feb. 6, 1989, in the Nievre region southwest of Paris.

U.N. Security Council has passed 12 resolutions condemning
Baghdad's government. The latest, which authorizes the use of
military force, was adopted Thursday.
   Aug. 3 - One day after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the Security Council
voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion and demand the immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's troops. Yemen, the only Arab
member of the council, did not vote on Resolution 660, saying it
did not have instructions.
   Aug. 6 - The council voted 13-0 to order a trade and financial
embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. Cuba and Yemen abstained on
Resolution 661.
   Aug. 9 - In Resolution 662, the council voted 15-0 to declare
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void in international law.
   Aug. 18 - In No. 664, the council voted 15-0 to demand that Iraq
free all detained foreigners.
   Aug. 25 - The council voted 13-0 to give the United States and
other naval powers the right to enforce the economic embargo
against Iraq and Kuwait by halting shipping to those countries.
Cuba and Yemen abstained on Resolution 665.
   Sept. 13 - The council voted 13-2 to allow humanitarian food aid
into Iraq or Kuwait only ``to relieve human suffering,'' and said
only the council could decide when those circumstances exist. Cuba
and Yemen voted against Resolution 666.
   Sept. 16 - The council voted 15-0 on Resolution 667 to condemn
Iraq's aggressive acts against diplomatic missions in Kuwait,
including the abduction of foreigners in the buildings.
   Sept. 24 - On Resolution 669, the council voted 15-0 to stress
that only its Sanctions Committee has the power to permit food,
medicine or other humanitarian aid to be sent into Iraq or occupied
Kuwait.
   Sept. 25 - The council voted 14-1 to explicitly expand its
economic embargo to include all air cargo traffic in or out of Iraq
and Kuwait, except for cargoes of humanitarian aid specifically
authorized by its Sanctions Committee. It also calls on U.N. member
nations to detain any Iraqi ships that may be used to break the
naval embargo. Cuba voted against Resolution 670.
   Oct. 29 - The council voted 13-0 to hold Iraq liable for war
damages and economic losses, to ask nations to collect evidence of
grave human rights abuses by the occupying forces, to demand that
the Western embassies in Kuwait City be restocked with food and
water, and to demand that all hostages be released. Cuba and Yemen
abstained on Resolution 674.
   Nov. 28 - The council voted 15-0 on Resolution 677 to condemn
Iraq's alleged attempts to drive out Kuwaitis and repopulate their
country, and it asked U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to take possession of Kuwait's census and citizenship
records for safekeeping.
   Nov. 29 - The council voted 12-2, with one abstention, to give
Baghdad ``one final opportunity'' until Jan. 15 to comply with all
previous resolutions. After that date, nations allied with Kuwait
are authorized ``to use all necessary means'' to force Iraq to
withdraw and honor the resolutions, a phrase that all council
members agree would permit a military strike. China abstained on
Resolution 678; Cuba and Yemen voted against it.

<HEAD>Galileo to Use Earth as Gravity Slingshot Dec. 8</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA's Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft
will zoom past Earth next week, taking pictures and making
measurements as if its home planet were an alien world.
   ``It will be the first time the Earth has been viewed from this
perspective. I expect it will give us a greater appreciation of
this place,'' said Bill O'Neil, project manager at the NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   Galileo's close encounter with Earth will take place on Dec. 8
and is aimed at using the planet's gravity like a slingshot to send
the craft on the right path.
   The craft will swoop about 593 miles above the southwest
Atlantic Ocean at 12:35 p.m. PST Dec. 8. Galileo was 3.97 million
miles from Earth today.
   Galileo will be the first planetary craft to approach Earth from
space. So the flyby will be ``our first chance to look at Earth as
we have at other planets,'' Torrence Johnson, Galileo's chief
scientist, said Thursday.
   During its flyby, the spacecraft will measure gases that cause
the ``greenhouse effect'' warming of Earth's atmosphere and will
study high-altitude water vapor that helps create and destroy
Earth's ozone layer, Johnson said.
   Galileo also will be the first spacecraft with modern
instruments to study the far side of the moon, which is always
pointed away from Earth, he added.
   Galileo is powered by two nuclear batteries - not reactors -
that use the decay of radioactive plutonium to produce electricity.
   Environmentalists unsuccessfully sued to halt Galileo's launch
for fear the plutonium could contaminate Earth's atmosphere. O'Neil
said the chance that Galileo will somehow plunge into Earth's
atmosphere and release its plutonium is less than one in 2 million.
   Even if it did happen, the plutonium would cause no more than 10
cancer deaths during the next 70 years, according to NASA.
   Galileo is the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever
built. It was launched from a space shuttle in October 1989 and is
scheduled to rendezvous with Jupiter in 1995 after a looping
2.4-billion-mile journey.
   Galileo's route was designed so the spacecraft could use Venus
and Earth as ``gravity slingshots.'' It will use Earth for that
purpose Dec. 8 and again in December 1992.
   It used Venus as a gravity slingshot last February. Scientists
discussed their Venus findings on Thursday.
   Galileo's infrared camera made the first pictures of Venus'
middle and lower cloud decks. Pictures also were used to make a
movie showing clouds moving in 150 mph winds.
   Studying Venus' acid clouds and its carbon dioxide atmosphere
may help scientists understand how increasing carbon dioxide levels
in Earth's atmosphere will warm the planet like glass trapping heat
in a greenhouse, said Arizona astronomer Michael Belton.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Political Leaders Demand Plebisicte Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA CANDELAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of three Puerto Rican
political parties are demanding the U.S. Senate authorize a 1991
plebiscite on whether the island should be independent or remain
tied to the United States.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, who favors the island's present
U.S. Commonwealth status and who leads the Popular Democratic
Party, was among the leaders who sent a letter Thursday to a Senate
committee.
   ``It would be undemocratic and contradictory that Congress
should not respond promptly and decisively to the request of 3.6
million citizens from Puerto Rico to be consulted as to the choice
of their ultimate political status,'' the letter read.
   Also signing the letter were Carlos Romero Barcelo, president of
the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, and the president of the
Puerto Rican Independence Party, Ruben Berrios.
   The letter was addressed to Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D.-La.,
chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, whose committee handles
issues pertaining to Puerto Rico. Johnston is to visit the island
next week.
   Legislation before Congress would allow Puerto Ricans to hold a
plebiscite next July on whether to continue as a U.S. commonwealth,
with increased autonomy; become the 51st state, or break away as an
independent nation.
   For the first time in history, polls indicate a narrow
preference for statehood over commonwealth status, under which
Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens but pay no federal taxes and cannot
vote for president. The polls reveal little support for
independence.
   President Bush has declared himself in favor of statehood for
Puerto Rico, which the United States annexed in 1898 during the
Spanish-American War.
   The Puerto Rican leaders demand that congressional leaders
settle their differences and come up with a bill so a referendum
can be held in 1991.
   It was announced in San Juan that Johnston will be accompanied
by Sen. Malcolm Wallop, RWWyo., when he arrives in Puerto Rico on
Monday night.
   The two will meet with party leaders to discuss the plebiscite.
   Johnston was a co-sponsor of a plebiscite bill.
   It was put on hold in October after Johnston repudiated a
referendum bill that passed the House, saying the status
definitions it offered were too vague.
   Johnston then offered a schedule providing for passage of a
plebiscite bill by July 4.
   However, Hernandez Colon's party in a meeting two weeks ago
demanded that plebiscite bills be filed in Congress by Feb. 19.

   Liverpool, the winningest team in
English soccer, has swept all before it on the way to 18 league
titles and four victories in the European Champions Cup.
   But it spent 12 years getting stubborn elderly sisters Norah and
Muriel Mason to move off club property.
   Liverpool bought a whole street so it could bulldoze the block
and spend $15 million expanding its Anfield stadium. But the
sisters, who have lived in the same two bedroom house for 50 years,
turned down 15 offers of alternative housing.
   Even after the club had demolished the rest of the street, and
their home stood forlorn amid the wasteland of a parking lot next
to the 40,000-capacity stadium, the sisters wouldn't budge.
   Liverpool's patience finally ran out, and the club went to
court.
   At Liverpool County Court on Wednesday, club lawyer David Geey
said the Mason sisters agreed to move by the end of February.

<HEAD>Ag Official Warns: Failure of Trade Talks Would Launch Subsidy War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the European Community doesn't negotiate
realistically next week at the closing rounds of global trade
talks, it will virtually launch an export subsidy war, warns a USDA
official.
   Deputy Agriculture Secretary Jack C. Parnell said the bargaining
nations scheduled to meet in Brussels are ``looking at the final
moments in the negotiations'' on liberalizing global agricultural
trade.
   The 12-nation EC has long been at odds with the United States
and other countries that are calling for reducing not only export
subsidies but internal farm supports that distort trade.
   The so-called Uruguay Round of negotiations has been going on
for four years under the auspices of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   ``If the Europeans can't come to the GATT negotiating table in
good faith, and discuss concrete reductions in agricultural
subsidies and the real, measurable lowering of tariff walls, then
they are making the initial unfriendly moves of  subsidy war,''
Parnell said Thursday.
   ``There is little doubt that the United States will retaliate,
using every tool available to us, in order to maintain our market
share,'' he said.
   Parnell also told the concluding session of the department's
annual outlook conference that U.S. farmers could face even greater
trade competition.
   ``Eastern Europe has been liberalized and we've all rejoiced,''
he said. ``But suppose the rest of Europe seduces these countries
into joining its common agricultural policy?''
   Parnell said that would mean the former East Germany, Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania all would be joining
the existing bloc.
   ``Can you imagine an 18-member common agricultural policy?
American farmers have many good reasons to support a GATT
agreement, not the least of which is holding onto their own
financial prosperity,'' he said.
   Parnell said there is ``a great sense of urgency'' surrounding
the successful completion of the Uruguay Round of talks. There is
intense competition and ``the high-risk path for U.S. agriculture
in today's world is to do nothing.''
   The past performance of GATT shows that the process does work,
he said. Tariffs on manufactured goods were reduced from 40 percent
in the mid-1960s to less than 6 percent now.
   But at the same time, the rate of protection on agricultural
goods has risen to 40 percent from 21 percent, Parnell said.
   Besides world trade, Parnell said environmental issues such as
food safety, wetlands, water quality and land use are other
problems facing agriculture. Government spending, budget deficits
and interest rates are others.
   Decisions will be made in the next 10 years ``to balance this
very fragile equation between the environment and our standard of
living,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Overseas demand for U.S. broilers is expected
to continue strong in 1991, according to Agriculture Department
analysts.
   Exports set a record this year and are expected to rise further,
economist Lee A. Christensen told the department's annual outlook
conference this week. In all, broiler shipments may total more than
1 billion pounds, or almost 6 percent of estimated 1991 production.
   Christensen said in his report that exports are expected to
benefit from ``continued and likely improved access to major
longstanding markets such as Japan, Mexico and Canada,'' and to new
markets in the Soviet Union.
   U.S. broiler output is forecast to expand next year by 5 percent
to 6 percent, following a 6.5 percent increase in 1990.
   Total federally inspected production will probably rise to
around 19.5 billion pounds in 1991 from an estimated 18.4 billion
pounds this year, he said. Per capita consumption may average about
73 pounds next year, up from 70 pounds in 1990.
   Average net returns to broiler producers in 1991 are estimated
at around eight cents per pound, about the same or slightly less
than this year's average.
   Christensen said the cost of production in 1991 will average 46
to 47 cents per pound on a ready-to-cook basis, about the same as
this year.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Many farmers apparently are backing away from
big-ticket machinery purchases next year, according to John A.
Stark, a Chicago analyst.
   Demand may drop by 7 percent, he said Thursday at the
Agriculture Department's annual outlook conference.
   Stark, editor of Stark's Off-Highway Ledger, said a new business
cycle began in North America in August.
   ``Since farm machinery production tends to trail the ups and
downs of farm vehicle sales by three to six months, cutbacks in
farm tractor and self-propelled combines is fully expected by the
1991 first quarter,'' Saark said in his report.
   Retail sales of farm vehicles will probably slip to 126,100 next
year, with machinery production dropping to 53,800 units, Stark
said.
   He projected that steep price discounts on tractors would occur
in the first quarter of next year, possibly sparking a ``sticker
price war.''
   Stark said that, because 70 percent of farm tractors are
foreign-made, ``low value of the dollar will surely create
extraordinary pressure for producing firms to raise vehicle
prices.''
   ``But the use of competitive price incentives will cause them to
absorb a major part of the price hikes ... cutting sharply into
profit margins.''
   Stark's Off-Highway Ledger is a biweekly publication analyzing
the farm machinery market.

<HEAD>Media Groups Seek Release of Noriega Tape Transcripts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today weighed whether the
transcripts of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls are the
property of CNN or are part of the public record and should be
shared with other news organizations.
   Four news organizations went before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler on Thursday seeking the court transcripts. Cable News
Network fought to keep them secret, accusing other media of trying
to scoop the network with its own story.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Monday.
   Robert Bernius, representing Gannett Co. and its USA Today,
argued that in the wake of Hoeveler's decision on Wednesday to lift
his 3-week-old ban on airing the tapes, the transcripts were of
vital public importance.
   ``We ... want to know why a First Amendment crisis was
precipitated by these tapes,'' Bernius said.
   Gannett and USA Today joined The Miami Herald, The Associated
Press and the Miami-area Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV in the
effort to obtain the transcripts.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the transcripts should be
burned or returned to the network.
   ``This is not a clash of First Amendment rights, it is merely a
display of competitive jealousy,'' CNN said in court papers.
   Bienstock argued that giving them to other media organizations
would be like CNN demanding that the organizations give the network
their own reporters' notes. The transcripts include some tapes that
CNN has never broadcast, he said.
   ``This is again an intrusion into the news-gathering,
news-editing process,'' said Bienstock.
   Sanford Bohrer, another attorney for the four media
organizations, said, ``I think it's unfortunate that CNN feels it's
being put upon by others in the media. The real issue is the
public's right to look at anything it can get its hands on.''
   He noted that the transcripts were made by the court and the
originll tapes were made by the Bureau of Prisons, not CNN.
   Hoeveler interrupted Bienstock frequently and chided CNN for
fighting previously to broadcast the tapes, then opposing release
of the transcripts.
   ``The whole thrust of your case was that you wanted the world to
know what was on the tapes,'' Hoeveler said.
   Bienstock also cited a reporter's right to protect a
confidential source, saying scrutiny of the transcripts could help
reveal who gave the tapes to CNN.
   But the judge noted that the government, through the U.S.
attorney's office, had already seen the transcripts.
   ``In any event,'' he added, I have very little sympathy with
your source. Someone down the line has committed some grave
improprieties.''
   Bernius said those seeking the tapes had no interest in
identifying CNN's source, only in getting ``access to the factual
basis of a landmark judicial determination.''
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   Noriega's attorneys went into court Nov. 8 after learning about
the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to play any that might
interfere with attorney-client privilege. The network aired some
portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew them when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   The transcripts then were prepared by court officials in Miami
to aid Hoeveler and attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents
of the tapes.
   On Wednesday, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the
tapes and returned them to the network. CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
has said the network had no immediate plans to play the unaired
tapes in the next few days.
   While CNN won't say where it got the tapes, Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
   One tape broadcast was a conversation between Noriega and his
defense team in which he speculated about whether two Panamanians
captured after the U.S. invasion would testify against him. On
another tape, Noriega appeared to be attempting to transfer $4
million with the help of his mistress' mother.

   A winter war with Iraq would spare troops and
equipment the strain of summer desert heat but would pose other
pitfalls, including dramatic temperature swings, high seas and
sudden sandstorms.
   Overall, U.S. military and private analysts believe the U.S.-led
forces in the Mideast would benefit most from fighting in the
cooler months because high-tech American weapons work better
without the summer heat. Also, Iraqi forces are used to the
triple-digit temperatures that will return in April.
   The winter carries other advantages for Saddam Hussein's Iraqi
forces, including the prospect that if he unleashed chemical
weapons, they could prove more deadly because gases linger longer
in cooler air.
   The United Nations Security Council approved a resolution
Thursday authorizing the use of force to drive Saddam's forces from
Kuwait if they do not leave by Jan. 15.
   ``A deadline for him isn't necessarily a deadline for us, but
from a military standpoint that's the time of year we'd prefer to
fight if it comes to that,'' said a Pentagon source who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``The break in the weather should work
to our advantage, both from a manpower and equipment-logistics
perspective.''
   That view is shared by other military and private analysts.
   ``Any temperature or weather extreme is going to degrade the
performance of your equipment, and our forces are heavily dependent
on electronics and high-tech systems,'' said Piers Wood, a Vietnam
combat veteran who now is a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve.
He also is chief of staff at the Center for Defense Information, a
liberal think tank that believes Bush should give economic
sanctions at least a year before opting for a military strike.
   As the United States mounted its Persian Gulf buildup in August,
it was quickly apparent that some sensitive equipment would not
perform up to standards in the Saudi summer, when temperatures can
reach 130 degrees.
   Rippling haze off the desert floor limited the effectiveness of
optical devices and blurred pilots' vision; radio wires melted;
troops grew weary fast under the sun and faced the prospect of
donning heavier chemical protective clothing in the event of
combat. Anything with an engine ran hot, requiring more frequent
routine maintenance at a time when spare parts were in short
supply.
   Now, temperatures in the region might climb into the 80s but
more likely will average highs in the mid-70s through February.
Daily highs will creep back into the 80s and 90s in March and then
over 100 degrees in April.
   The cooler climate means better performance from virtually all
mechanical equipment, from jeeps to the high-tech turbines in M-1
tanks and fighter jets.
   But desert sand grows softer in the cooler months, limiting
vehicles' mobility. Because of that, analysts believe it would be
easier for both sides to predict likely routes if the enemy decides
to launch a ground attack.
   That bodes well for Saddam if Bush ordered an attack; Iraq's
forces are in heavily fortified defensive positions and are
familiar with the terrain. Northern Saudi Arabia has dry river beds
that can become swampy in the winter if there is heavy rain, which
could complicate any ground offensive into Kuwait.
   Another slight advantage for Saddam in a winter war would be the
increased potency of his mustard and nerve gas weapons, although
analysts believe the gains would be marginal.
   ``The agents will perform better under cooler conditions but
it's more a matter of degree than any dramatic improvement,'' said
Seth Carus, the author of a Washington Institute for Near East
Policy report on Iraq's chemical arsenal. ``It will make a
difference but I still don't see chemical weapons proving to make
any decisive difference.''
   In the desert winter, temperature swings and unpredictable,
sand-stirring winds replace heat as an army's enemy.
   The U.S. military has made no secret of its desire to fight at
night, when it believes its night vision equipment and other
technology would provide a significant edge over Iraqi forces.
   Sub-freezing temperatures are not unheard of at night on the
Arabian peninsula and farther north in Kuwait and Iraq, so any
troops moving in the cold during night maneuvers would have to be
ready to deal with a 40- to 50-degree temperature swing by
daylight.
   Mindful of that, the Pentagon was shipping sleeping bags,
blankets and winter uniforms to the Mideast even as soldiers
complained about the heat.
   An Air Force summary also warns that wind shifts can bring gusts
up to 45 knots, turbulence, blowing dust and sand and can cut
visibility to less than 50 feet, making flying extremely dangerous.
   Seas, as the Marines learned during recent exercises along the
gulf coast, can experience waves up to 15 feet.

<HEAD>Inherited Mutation Called Related to Breast Cancer in Some
Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abnormal gene found in some families can
lead to a high susceptibility to breast cancer, according to a
study published today.
   The finding is a major step that puts researchers closer to
understanding the inherited tendency to develop malignancies, says
study in the journal Science.
   The inherited genetic mutation was discovered by studying the
genes in a small group of families that experience in generation
after generation of an exceptionally high rate of six types of
cancer, including breast cancer.
   ``Up until now there have been no inherited genes isolated and
identified which provided susceptibilities to some of the common
adult malignancies,'' said Dr. Stephen Friend of Massachusetts
General Hospital Cancer Center.
   Scientists have long questioned whether a single mutation in a
single inherited gene could advance the tendency to develop cancer.
Friend said the study settles that question.
   ``This shows that the answer is yes,'' said Friend. ``If you are
born with an inactive region in one gene, then that gives you a
hidden susceptibility to malignancies.''
   Although the breast cancer is the most common disease related to
the mutated gene, Friend said it is not the only genetic cause of
breast cancer.
   ``There are multiple genes for breast cancer,'' he said. ``This
happens to be the first, but it won't be the last.''
   Female breast cancer strikes about 130,000 American women
annually and kills about 41,000. Friend said that ``it is unclear
at this time which of those many women have the ... mutation.''
   Friend, who was lead author of the study, said the mutation was
found on what is called the p53 cancer suppressor gene. For people
who inherit a mutated p53 gene, he said, ``their chance of getting
a malignancy by age 60 is 90 percent.''
   Dr. Andrew Feinberg, a University of Michigan Cancer Center
researcher and co-discoverer of genes related to a rare kidney
cancer, said the p53 discovery adds a step in the cascade of cell
changes that is thought to lead to some cancers.
   ``From a scientific viewpoint, it is very important because it
helps us understand the sequence of events that lead to cancer,''
said Feinberg. However, he emphasized that there are a number of
other steps, still unknown, that cause a normal cell to become
cancerous.
   The p53 gene is one of a group of genes that control cell
growth. The gene, in effect, blocks the uncontrolled division of
cells, hence, suppresses tumor development. If this function is
lost through mutation, then the cell lacks one of the controls that
keep division in balance.
   The mutated p53 gene has been detected in the past in a number
of types of cancers, but the new study is the first to find that
the mutation can be inherited.
   Inherited gene mutations have been related in earlier studies to
rare eye and kidney cancers.
   Friend said he and his colleagues isolated the specific p53 gene
mutation by studying people with what is called the Li-Fraumeni
syndrome. These are families in which there is an inherited
tendency to develop one of six types of cancer at an early age,
often during childhood.
   Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among Li-Fraumeni
families, but they also can develop leukemias, brain tumors,
sarcomas of the bone and cancer of the adrenal gland.
   The researchers discovered the mutation in the cells of
Li-Fraumeni family members who had cancer, but not in those family
members who were free of the disease.
   Friend said that in the affected family members the p53 mutation
was found in every cell, indicating it was passed genetically from
one generation to another.
   The Li-Fraumeni syndrome was first described by Frederick P. Li
and Joseph F. Fraumeni Jr., both of the National Cancer Institute
and coauthors of the study in Science. The syndrome is very rare,
with only about 200 such families in the United States.
   With discovery of the p53 mutation, Friend said a screening
process may be developed to determine which members in a
Li-Fraumeni family have inherited the abnormal gene. When one
parent in a family has the mutation, there is a 50-50 chance that
each child will inherit it.
   Children that show the mutation, said Friend, could then undergo
periodic, intensified examinations for cancer so that the
malignancies they will almost certainly develop could be found very
early.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Three More Cubans Vanish; Two Doctors Given Travel Papers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Cuban doctors have obtained
refugee status after seeking asylum in an embassy, and at least
three other Cuban medical workers are reportedly hiding.
   The two doctors, who were granted the documents on Thursday,
said at the Costa Rican ambassador's residence that they were
anxious to leave the country. They said they fear Cuban state
security agents will capture them and take them back to Cuba.
   Cuban security agents remained in Nicaragua after the leftist
Sandinistas lost Feb. 25 elections and turned the government over
to anti-communist President Violeta Chamorro.
   The government was said to be reluctant to grant the doctors
exit documents out of fear of an avalanche of Cubans seeking to
flee the country.
   At least 300 Cuban medical workers still work in Nicaragua and
the government depends on them and other foreign doctors to run its
public hospitals.
   Nicaraguan doctors fled in droves during the decade of
Sandinista rule, creating a shortage of health care workers.
   ``The Interior Ministry doesn't want to set a precedent because
the government could be faced with a wave'' of defections by Cuban
doctors, a well-informed Foreign Ministry source said.
   The Cuban doctors - Mario Antonio Reyes Morales, 29, and
Gilberto Marcelino Perez Franco, 30 - are neonatal specialists who
arrived in Nicaragua in early 1989.
   Reyes and Perez said they returned to Nicaragua Nov. 22 after a
one-month vacation in Cuba and learned a Cuban nurse had gone into
hiding, intending to defect.
   ``That's when we decided'' to defect, Reyes told The Associated
Press. They asked for asylum at the Costa Rican Embassy the next
day.
   Reyes identified the nurse as Giovanni Domenico, 23, who had
been working at the Lenin Fonseca hospital in Managua.
   The Foreign Ministry source said two other Cuban doctors at
Managua hospitals also had disappeared and were presumed to be in
hiding.
   ``The Cubans are looking for them,'' the source said.
   Repeated calls to the Cuban Embassy were answered by people who
said no one there was authorized to speak to reporters.
   Negotiations among Cuban, Nicaraguan and Costa Rican officials
on Reyes and Perez began Tuesday. They were granted refugee status
and given travel documents Thursday.
   Costa Rican Ambassador Carlos Aguilar said he had been
``fighting'' with Nicaraguan authorities for the men's papers.
   ``Yesterday we told them that if Nicaragua didn't solve this,
that Costa Rica was willing to do anything to help them,'' Aguilar
said.
   Reyes said he and Perez were afraid Cuban state security agents
might hunt them down if they remained in Nicaragua.
   He recalled the case of another Cuban doctor, Gerardo Banguela,
who Reyes said sought political asylum in 1983 at the Honduran
Embassy in Managua.
   ``The Cuban state security in Nicaragua lured him out using a
girl, and when he came out they jumped him,'' Reyes said. ``They
fractured a femur and other extremities. He's still in prison in
Cuba.''

   The resolution passed by the Security
Council sanctioning the use of force against Iraq echoes another
passed in 1950 to authorize sending U.S. and other troops to South
Korea.
   But the Cold War is over, and this time the West didn't have to
sneak the resolution past the Soviets.
   The measure gives Baghdad until Jan. 15 to pull out of Kuwait or
face possible attack by U.N. member states. It was approved 12-2
Thursday.
   The Soviet Union, after wresting a few more weeks grace period
for Iraq, supports the latest proposal. China, hesitant to use
force against Iraq, said beforehand it would not vote for the
resolution, but abstained rather than use its veto power.
   The East-West unity is a far cry from the divided atmosphere
that prevailed in June 1950, when Chinese-backed North Korea
invaded South Korea.
   At that time, Moscow was boycotting council sessions to protest
the seating of China's Nationalist government on the world body,
rather than the Communist government that took power on the
mainland a year earlier.
   On June 27, 1950, the British and French gave a diplomatic boost
to the United States by introducing a hurriedly prepared
use-of-force resolution.
   ``Yes, they did go very fast in the council, because they
naturally were afraid the Russians would come back,'' said Brian
Urquhart, who helped organize the world body. He retired in 1986 as
undersecretary-general in charge of peacekeeping.
   ``They knew they were doing a dirty deed in the dead of night by
not consulting with a permanent council member,'' another U.N.
official said on condition of anonymity.
   The United States contributed the largest contingent to a
16-nation force that entered the conflict under U.N. auspices.
North Korea, China and the U.N. forces signed an armistice in 1953,
but no comprehensive peace has ever been struck.
   The 1950 resolution ``recommends that the members of the United
Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be
necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international
peace and security in the area.''
   The new anti-Iraq resolution is similar, in that it gives the
United States and other allied powers permission to act without any
direct U.N. control.
   The Soviet Union initially wanted a strong role for the Security
Council's Military Staff Committee, a group of military advisers
from the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, France and China.
   But the only council involvement called for by the resolution is
that member states ``keep the council regularly informed on the
progress of actions'' they undertake.

   Roseanne Barr's financial battle with her
ex-husband made the airwaves when she called ``Donahue'' and got
into a shouting match over whether she owes him money.
   Bill Pentland, who was a guest on the show Thursday with his
lawyer, Marvin Mitchelson, said Miss Barr owes him for helping
launch her career.
   But the star of the top-rated ABC show ``Roseanne'' accused him
of being more interested in publicity than money.
   ``Bill, you own two houses. You have five cars. I, in January,
gave you $200,000 cash to live on for three months,'' she said.
``It is about publicity, Bill.''
   Pentland has asked a judge to declare Miss Barr's ``celebrity
status'' a marital asset, give it a dollar value and divide it
between them. The case is expected to go to trial in January.
   Miss Barr was married to Pentland for 14 years. She is now
married to Tom Arnold.
   Phil Donahue said the calls weren't set up and that Miss Barr
got through ``honest and square.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - David Opont, the 12-year-old who was tied up and
set afire by a neighborhood bully he thought was forcing drugs on
him, was hailed as a ``hero of the year'' by Vice President Dan
Quayle.
   Quayle embraced the boy Thursday in presenting him with the
American Sportscasters Hall of Fame's Hero of the Year award.
   ``David's courage has set an example for all Americans to stand
their ground and not let drugs take over,'' said Quayle. ``With
brave Americans like David, I'm convinced we'll win the war on
drugs.''
   Opont was accosted by a 14-year-old on March 7 and taken to the
basement of an abandoned building, where he was set on fire.
   He initially was given less than a 50 percent chance of
survival. He was released from the hospital last summer.

   ATLANTA (AP) - Jordan Knight of New Kids on the Block and one of
the pop group's bodyguard are being sued by a man who says he was
assaulted in a nightclub.
   Douglas Winston of Yonkers, N.Y., charged in a complaint filed
in state court Thursday that bodyguard Steven Chandler attacked him
without provocation Aug. 8.
   He said the incident occurred at an Atlanta nightspot where
Chandler and Knight had gone after a performance.
   Chandler, arrested and charged with two counts of battery, was
freed on $4,500 bail.
   The lawsuit seeks payment for medical expenses and punitive
damages.
   New Kids attorney Len Lewin said, ``It's not uncommon for famous

   BALTIMORE (AP) - A scene in ``Die Hard 2'' in which Bruce Willis
takes a power drill to an airport air duct ended up on the
cutting-room floor, and now 20th Century Fox could end up in court.
   Black &amp; Decker Inc. has filed suit in federal court in
Baltimore, accusing the filmmaker and the marketing firm
Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam of failing to fulfill a promise that one of
its drills would be featured in the film.
   Black &amp; Decker said in court papers filed Nov. 7 that it had
planned an ad campaign based on the scene.
   The company is seeking at least $150,000. It accused Fox, the
film's distributor, and Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam of negligence and
breach of contract.
   Attempts to reach Krown-Young &amp; Rubicam after business hours
Thursday were unsuccessful. Fox spokesman Dennis Petroskey would
not comment.

<TEXT>
   Police have banned a play about poor
people, saying the performance could cause social unrest. Some
leading intellectuals say the police action highlights increasing
government sensitivity to criticism.
   Actress Ratna Riantiarno said the comedy ``Cockroach Opera'' had
been scheduled to open Wednesday for a 10-day run at the Jakarta
Art Center.
   ``The police suddenly came and told us the play was banned
without giving any clear reason,'' she said Thursday.
   ``Cockroach Opera'' already had been presented three times in
1985 in Jakarta and the West Java capital of Bandung, she said.
   ``After reading the manuscript, we found that the message of the
play was sensitive and that it could create social unrest,'' said
Maj. T.M. Siahaan, the district police chief.
   Lt. Col. Latief Rabar, a spokesman, said police ``and other
authorities'' were still studying the ban order. He declined to say
why the play was not banned during its earlier performances in
1985.
   The play deals with poor people whose lives are full of
suffering, said Nano Riantiarno, Mrs. Riantiarno's husband and the
director of Theater Koma, which was staging the play.
   ``Good fortune never comes their way and their place in life
seems to have been destined, in sewers, ditches and in dark filthy
and stinking corners, where only cockroaches live,'' he said.
   Several intellectuals and art critics say the government was
showing signs of increasing sensitivity.
   The government earlier this month banned a New York Times
reporter who wrote an article saying President Suharto's decision
on whether to run for reelection appeared to hinge on whether his
children's lucrative businesses would be affected.
   Suharto was named president in 1968 and was reelected in 1973,
1978 and 1988.
   Farida Feisol, director of the Jakarta Art Center, noted that
``Succession,'' a satirical play by Theater Koma on the issue of
succession to power, was banned in October, on the 12th day of a
scheduled 14-day run.
   Early this month, police stopped well-known poet W.S. Rendra
from reading two of his poems just 30 minutes before his
performance was to have begun.Police said the poems, dealing with
corruption and injustice, could cause instability if read in
public.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Claims Reporter Fired From UPI for Being Lesbian</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former United Press International reporter
claims in a $12.75 million lawsuit that she was fired from the news
service because she is a lesbian and wrote a freelance story for a
gay publication.
   Julie Brienza's lawsuit was filed Thursday in U.S. District
Court. UPI and Wisconsin Voice of Christian Youth, a
Milwaukee-based religious group, were named as defendants.
   Brienza, who was UPI's Supreme Court reporter, alleged that she
was dismissed under pressure from Vic Eliason, the religious
group's executive director.
   In the suit, Brienza contends that Eliason began a campaign to
have her fired after she interviewed him on April 10 for a
freelance article she was writing about the influence of the
``religious right'' on broadcasting.
   The suit alleges that Eliason buys news from UPI, and that he
contacted UPI management to complain about Brienza writing for The
Washington Blade, a news weekly. He then urged listeners to his
radio network to jam UPI's telephone lines demanding her dismissal,
the suit said.
   On April 27, UPI fired her, accusing her of violating
freelancing rules.
   ``UPI terminated Brienza's employment because of her sexual
orientation, and because she was writing a freelance article for a
gay and lesbian newspaper,'' the suit contends.
   UPI spokesman Milt Capps said Thursday he could not comment on
the suit until he had seen it. But earlier, Capps had denied that
Brienza's firing was due to pressure from religious broadcasters
and said it was based on violations of UPI work rules.
   Officials at Wisconsin Voice of Christian Youth Inc. in
Milwaukee did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
   The suit seeks $750,000 in general damages, plus $12 million in
punitive damages - $10 million from Eliason and $2 million from UPI
- for, among other things, alleged violation of privacy, loss of
income and violation of a District of Columbia law that prohibits
discrimination in employment based on a person's sexual
orientation. The suit contends Wisconsin's ``hate crime'' law also
was violated.
   Besides the $12.75 million, the suit seeks return of Brienza's
job, back pay, and a retraction from Eliason and his group.
   The suit acknowledges that Brienza used UPI's internal message
system to retrieve information on Eliason from the news agency's
Milwaukee bureau and that she made two long-distance phone calls
for the story from UPI's Washington office.
   UPI rules, according to the suit, prohibit employees from
freelancing on company time, doing outside work that could compete
with UPI or writing articles that take an advocacy position.
   But Brienza, at a news conference Thursday, contended her use of
company facilities was minimal, and that other UPI employees
routinely did the same for personal reasons or for outside work.
She said The Blade is not an advocacy publication and that she had
gotten permission from UPI management prior to working on the
article.
   She said UPI's actions were out of proportion to the offense and
that the issue in her firing really was her sexual orientation.

   AIDS in the United States is rising faster among
women than men, scientists say.
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control projected that by next year
AIDS would be the nation's fifth leading cause of death among
American women of childbearing age. It is now sixth or seventh,
according to the CDC.
   Separately, the World Health Organization predicted a dramatic
increase in the infection rate among women worldwide by the end of
the century.
   Both studies were released Thursday.
   ``I think these findings are a cause for alarm for almost
everyone,'' said Dr. Constance Wofsy, a professor of clinical
medicine and an AIDS specialist at the University of California at
San Francisco.
   AIDS still occurs mostly among homosexual men and intravenous
drug users.
   Women are most likely to become infected through sex with men
who carry the virus.
   Such women rarely suspect they are at risk and often fail to
take precautions, Wofsy said. Symptoms that would alert doctors to
test for AIDS in a homosexual do not set off the same ``red light''
in women, Wofsy said.
   ``Physicians are going to have to become detectives,'' she said.
   The Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report that by the end
of the year, AIDS cases among U.S. women would exceed 15,000, about
11 percent of all reported cases More than 9,000 of those women
will be dead by then, it said.
   In the last year, the AIDS rate rose 29 percent among women and
18 percent among men, the federal health agency said.
   Currently, cancer is the No. 1 killer of women between 15 and
44, followed by accidental deaths, heart disease, homicide and
suicide, the CDC said.
   Seventy-two percent of the American women stricken with AIDS are
black or Hispanic, although those groups account for only 19
percent of the total U.S. female population, the CDC said.
   From November 1989 through this October, 4.3 AIDS cases and
about 2.7 deaths were reported per 100,000 women in the United
States.
   The WHO report said the share of global infection by the AIDS
virus via sex between men and women would rise from 60 percent now
to between 75 percent and 80 percent by 2000.
   The international health organization forecast that by the end
of the decade the number of carriers of the AIDS virus would rise
to between 25 million and 30 million worldwide, including 10
million babies infected by their mothers.
   It said that of the 9 million to 11 million people now carrying
the AIDS virus, about one-third are women.

<HEAD>Immunization Effort Would Target Poor Preschoolers</HEAD>

   The Bush administration may initiate a program
next year to vaccinate poor preschoolers as a way of checking a
recent outbreak in childhood diseases, officials say.
   So far this year, 24,163 measles cases have been reported, a 67
percent increase from the same period in 1989, says the Centers for
Disease Control.
   Health experts say the problem is that many poorer pre-school
children aren't being immunized, though under state laws they must
be innoculated before attending classes.
   ``We need to identify ... points of contact'' between
governmental systems and pre-school children, Dr. James O. Mason,
assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, said Thursday.
   Federal officials have discussed mandatory and voluntary
approaches to immunization. They have even considered the
possibility of making inoculations a requirement for receiving
welfare or Medicaid.
   But ``I don't think anybody is seriously saying `No shot, no
welfare,'' said Mason. ``No one wants to deny children Medicaid''
or welfare benefits.
   ``The president is distressed that we have'' a significant
increase in the incidence of childhood disease and Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan ``is similarly distressed,'' said
Mason.
   Mason suggested that ``the finances are basically there''
already for such a program, but others disputed him.
   ``Money's got to be there, whether it's voluntary or enforced,''
and it will fall to Congress rather than individual states to
provide it, said Dr. James Strain, executive director of the
American Academy of Pediatrics.
   Congress appropriates money for childhood vaccines, but not
enough to supply it to everyone who needs it, said Strain.
   One problem officials are thrashing out is how to go about
immunizing children.
   Mason suggested that public health professionals might be on
hand at some point in the welfare or Medicaid process to administer
shots to children.
   ``There are ways to do this'' short of refusing welfare or
Medicaid benefits, said Dr. Thomas Vernon, executive director of
the Colorado Health Department.
   The recipient could be placed on a timetable for having his or
her children immunized, suggested Vernon. Another approach, he
said, might be to have a welfare office require a recipient to go
to a specific location to get immunization started.
   ``The issue is simply that we need to help every child get
immunized against measles,'' said Mason. ``Our problem in the U.S.
is not school-age children. It's before they go to school. That's
where we are having disastrous outbreaks with permanent damage and
dying children'' from whooping cough and other childhood diseases.

<HEAD>UN Gives Iraq Ultimatum: Get Out of Kuwait In Six Weeks Or Face
Attack</HEAD>

   UNITED NATIONS - The Security Council has given Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein six weeks to pull his troops out of Kuwait before
the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf are free to
launch a military strike.
   The council voted 12-to-two Thursday evening, with China
abstaining and Yemen and Cuba opposed, to give Baghdad ``one final
opportunity'' to end its aggression against Kuwait, which began
with the Aug. 2 invasion.
   If Iraq has not withdrawn its army by Jan. 15, restored the emir
of Kuwait's government and freed all hostages it holds, the
U.S.-led multinational force may use ``all necessary means'' to
force Baghdad's compliance.
   It was the first time in 40 years the council had sanctioned
force to counter aggression; the first and last time was when it
gave its blessing to U.S.-led allies in Korea.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein scoffed at the resolution and
said Iraq was ready to resist even the most advanced U.S. war
systems.
   ``The Americans are still influenced by Rambo movies, but this
is not a Rambo movie. This is something different,'' he said
Thursday. ``We do not underestimate American military power, but we
scorn their evil intentions.''
   Thirteen foreign ministers attended the extraordinary council
session, with Secretary of State James A. Baker III presiding,
making it one of the highest-level council meetings in history.
   ``Today, we have started the countdown of the `pause of good
will,' '' said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. ``We
are confident that before the time is up a turn toward peace will
have occurred, and that the pause will usher in a transition to a
political settlement.''
   If not, said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, ``No one
can accuse the council of impatience. The military option is
reality, not bluff. If it has to be used it will be used, with the
full backing of the council.''
   In Washington, President Bush called the U.N. vote ``a very
strong and powerful message. It will go around the world loud and
clear that this guy's got to get out of there.''
   Joining the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union in
voting for the resolution were France, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia,
Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania and Zaire.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said China, which supported
11 previous U.N. resolutions, did not veto the measure Thursday
because it shares outrage over Iraq's aggression, but that China
could not sanction an allied attack.
   ``The United Nations ... should act with great caution and avoid
taking hasty actions on such a major question as authorizing some
member states to take military actions,'' he said.
   The resolution made no mention of a U.N. military command or any
U.N. role in overseeing a possible international military
operation. The Soviet Union has said Soviet forces only would be
committed to a military operation under U.N. auspices.
   Shevardnadze later told reporters the Soviet Union would not
consider committing any troops at this time. He cited painful
memories of World War II.
   The Iraqis appeared intransigent.
   ``If war is imposed upon us by the United States, this will be
our destiny,'' said Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari.
   ``Our people will not kneel, we will rise to this
responsibility,'' he said, as Baker glared at him and fidgeted
impatiently.
   Sitting in the council chamber below a mural of a peaceful world
arising from the ashes of war, Kuwait's foreign minister said Iraq
``is pushing the region to a conflagration which we do not want,
but which appears to be the only avenue to restore our rights.''
   The Kuwaiti, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber, reviled the ``wild
beasts'' from Iraq whom he said were pillaging his country and
murdering his people.
   Iraq's ambassador linked his nation's cooperation with Western
efforts to promote a general Mideast peace settlement, including a
homeland for the Palestinians.
   ``Iraq calls for peace, it desires peace, not for us alone but
for the entire Middle East region,'' al-Anbari said.
   Nine affirmative votes were required for passage. Any of the
five permanent council members - the United States, the Soviet
Union, Britain, France and China - could have vetoed the measure.
The other members change on a rotating basis.
   The council resolution strengthens Bush's hand with Congress and
the American people in calling for offensive action against
Baghdad.
   Hearings on the gulf crisis continued on Capitol Hill with
criticism Thursday from former Navy Secretary James Webb, who added
his voice to those questioning Bush's plan to send another 200,000
troops to Saudi Arabia to back up the 240,000 already there.
   ``The president's mistake in sending so many troops should not
be compounded by a further error in using them in a premature,
unprovoked ground offensive,'' Webb said.

<TEXT>
   In another sign of a weakening economy, the number of people on
welfare rose in all but one state in the past year.
   An Associated Press survey of welfare rolls in all 50 states
found that only Wisconsin had bucked the trend, partly because it
enacted pioneering programs to get people off welfare.
   Although a troubled economy was the villain in many states, it
was not the sole reason - or even the most important one - in
others.
   Officials in some states attributed the increase to changes in
immigration law or to programs that help poor people apply for
welfare. Some mentioned changes in federal Medicaid requirements
that have brought more people into the welfare system.
   And some were simply stumped by the upsurge.
   ``Our economy is good, the employment picture is good, so we're
not sure what factors are responsible,'' said Alfred K. Suga,
deputy director of Hawaii's Department of Human Services.
   Hawaii had one of the smallest increases - 1.1 percent - in the
number of households receiving Aid to Families with Dependent
Children, the benchmark welfare program. New Hampshire had the
largest - 46 percent.
   ``Those numbers are startling,'' said Tom Pryor, an
administrator in New Hampshire's Office of Economic Services. ``The
primary reason that we see for that increase has been the decline
in the New England economy.''
   Elsewhere in New England, AFDC caseloads went up 25 percent in
Vermont, 19 percent in Connecticut, 14 percent in Maine and Rhode
Island and 10 percent in Massachusetts.
   The Southwest also was hard hit by welfare increases, partly
because new immigration rules allowed more non-citizens to qualify
for welfare.
   The AFDC caseload was up 9 percent in California, where nearly 2
million people were receiving benefits in September. It rose 23
percent in Arizona, 17 percent in Texas and 14 percent in New
Mexico.
   Many states attributed the increase to their own efforts to
reach out to poor people and enroll them in welfare programs. Some
have adopted a ``one-stop shopping'' concept for social services,
so that poor people seeking one form of public assistance are given
access to others.
   Another factor has been a federal mandate that makes Medicaid
available to more pregnant women and infants. This has caused huge
jumps in Medicaid caseloads - they are up 46 percent in Indiana,
for instance - and has also caused a spillover into other programs,
such as AFDC and food stamps.
   ``When someone comes in and asks for Medicaid, we don't just
check to see if they are eligible for Medicaid, we check to see if
they are eligible for more services,'' said Sherron Heinemann,
spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Human Services.
   The government has no current figures for AFDC caseloads
nationwide. The average monthly caseload for 1989, the most recent
year for which figures were available, was 3.79 million households.
   There are more recent figures for food stamps - the Agriculture
Department says there were 20.2 million people receiving food
stamps in September, up 7 percent from the year before.
   The Farm Belt and portions of the Deep South have come closest
to resisting the welfare upsurge. Farm states such as North Dakota,
Iowa and Kansas have shown increases of less than 1 percent, as
have such Southern states as Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana.
   Wisconsin's AFDC caseload actually dropped 2 percent in the past
year, and that came after three years of even larger declines.
Officials attribute the drop to a strong state economy and
experiments that require children of welfare recipients to stay in
school and welfare mothers to work or attend school. The state
provides day care for working welfare recipients.
   ``What we are seeing is the payoff of the efforts to encourage
people to move from welfare to independence,'' said Elizabeth
Snider-Allen of the state Division of Economic Support.
   The rise in welfare caseloads in other states will be costly.
The federal government pays the entire cost of food stamps - an
estimated $14.1 billion this year - but states pay anywhere from
32.5 percent to 50 percent of the cost of AFDC.
   ``What will states do?'' asked Marcia Howard, research director
for the National Association of State Budget Officers. ``They'll
just pay it. They really don't have a choice. ... And they will
divert funds from other programs to do it, most likely.''
   The rising caseloads also may mean that states will be less
likely to increase eligibility or benefits for AFDC, which already
are well beneath the federal poverty level in most states. In
Alabama, for instance, a single parent and two children receive
$124 a month in AFDC benefits.
   ``The money barely keeps them intact,'' said Tony Lee, a
lobbyist for the poor in Washington state, which pays an average of
$545 per month for families on AFDC. ``They stagger from one crisis
to the next, the rent, the telephone bill, the lights. They just
don't have the energy and everything else it takes to make it.''

   The U.N. Security Council, for years
divided and ineffectual, has been widely praised for its newfound
courage in a series of bold resolutions aimed at ending Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   But in its latest and toughest resolution adopted Thursday -
authorizing military force to eventually evict Iraq - it may have
undertaken its most dangerous mission.
   After successes in peacemaking and peacekeeping in Afghanistan,
the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, Namibia, Central America, Western Sahara
and soon in Cambodia, the United Nations has encountered in the
gulf what may be the post-Cold War litmus test of its
effectiveness.
   The last time the U.N. Security Council approved the use of
force to redress aggression was in 1950 in the Korean conflict.
   Never before has the council acted so swiftly and decisively to
counter aggression as soon as it erupted. U.N. resolutions have led
to sweeping economic sanctions against Iraq, enforced by an air
embargo and a maritime embargo. On the high seas, the council
sanctioned the use of force to implement the trade embargo.
   In the Iran-Iraq war, the council waited seven years before
approving Resolution 598 in 1987, demanding an immediate end to the
war. That resolution failed to impose sanctions against either
side.
   Iranian diplomats said Iraq probably felt emboldened by lack of
U.N. action in the Iran-Iraq war when it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   In its 12th resolution condemning Iraq's aggression, the council
Thursday voted 12-2, with China abstaining, to sanction a military
strike if Iraqi troops do not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15. Cuba
and Yemen opposed the decision.
   Military action is sanctioned, but not mandated, and therein
lies the rub, some diplomats say.
   If the United Nations and its members fail to achieve a peaceful
settlement, which all of them say they seek, the organization will
be faulted for lack of effectiveness.
   Failing a peaceful settlement, if there is no military followup,
the organization and its members will be faulted for lack of
commitment.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the Security Council
Thursday, ``We must not let the United Nations go the way of the
League of Nations. We must fulfill our common vision of a peaceful
and just post-Cold War world.
   ``But if we are to do so, we must meet the threat to
international peace created by Saddam Hussein's aggression.''
   He cited the conquest of Ethiopia by Italy in 1936, likening it
to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Emperor Haile Selassie's appeal to
the League of Nations ultimately fell upon deaf ears.
   ``The League's efforts to redress aggression failed,'' Baker
said, ``and international disorder and war ensued. History now has
given us another chance.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told the council
that Iraq's conquest of Kuwait confronts the council ``with the
first extremely grave test of the post-Cold War period.''
   No member of the council, he said, seeks a bellicose outcome of
the crisis. ``But neither should anyone be mistaken about the
collective will of the international community, about its resolve
and readiness to act,'' he said.
   Former U.N. Undersecretary-General Brian Urquhart, a key player
in peacekeeping efforts during U.N.'s lean years in the 1970s and
early 1980s, called the council's effectiveness ``really an
astonishing turnabout.
   ``I think this will be genuinely a turning point in human
history, because this will be the test of whether collective
security is a valid response to aggression.''

   The operators of a company that once beamed
pornographic movies to home television viewers pleaded guilty to a
federal obscenity charge and agreed to pay a $150,000 fine, the
Justice Department said.
   Paul L. Klein and Jeffrey Younger also promised to forever
refrain from promoting or distributing sexually explicit films or
publications, the Justice Department said Thursday.
   Their Home Dish Only Satellite Networks Inc., which once used a
satellite to feed such movies as ``Hard Core Girlfriends'' and
``Ramb-Ohh Sex Platoon'' to 30,000 subscribers to its American
Exxxtasy Channel, pleaded guilty in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y.
   HDO's guilty plea marked the first prosecution under a 1988 law
that bars distribution of obscene material by cable or subscription
television.
   Until investigators pulled the plug on the operation last March,
HDO was the only nationwide satellite network beaming hard-core
pornography to home television viewers, the Justice Department
said.
   The movies were transmitted from the company's Buffalo office to
a satellite uplink station operated by U.S. Satellite Inc. in Salt
Lake City, that relayed them to the GTE Spacenet Corp. satellite,
the Justice Department said.
   In Buffalo, the company pleaded guilty to one felony count of
transmitting an obscene promotional movie, ``Hot Shorts,'' on Feb.
25, 1990 from Buffalo. It also agreed to plead guilty to a separate
felony charge in Salt Lake City, Utah, of transmitting the movie
``Hardcore Girlfriends'' the next day.

   The White House says budget director Richard
Darman and Rep. Newt Gingrich have settled differences, but Darman
is standing behind a speech that enraged the Georgia Republican and
other GOP conservatives.
   Darman, in a Nov. 16 speech, ridiculed efforts by administration
conservatives to promote self-help programs for the poor as a major
Bush domestic initiative next year.
   On Wednesday, Gingrich, the House Republican Whip, accused
Darman of making ``an assault on members of his own party'' and
said the budget director should either recant or resign.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday that
Darman and Gingrich spoke by telephone for 45 minutes and smoothed
over their differences.
   ``Director Darman and Newt had a long conversation this morning
and they are great and good friends, and there's no problem,''
Fitzwater said.
   However, Fitzwater said Darman was not withdrawing the comment
he made in his speech and a Gingrich spokesman said ``Newt stands
by his earlier statement.''
   Tony Blankley, Gingrich's press secretary, said the two have
agreed to try to resolve their policy differences.

<TEXT>
   Kamikaze pilots couldn't sink the USS Cabot
in World War II, but a lawsuit, a fire, costly repairs and red tape
nearly scuttled both the aircraft carrier and an American Legion
chapter.
   The rustbucket's fate is still in doubt, but with a $2 million
grant recently approved by Congress, members of American Legion
Post 377 say it now looks like the venerable warship will win its
last battle.
   ``Just about everybody else thinks we're crazy, but someday this
will be a first-class naval museum and everyone that sees it will
be proud,'' said Gordon Pfluger, Legion post commander.
   The post's efforts to acquire the ship and convert it into a
museum have put it $750,000 in debt and entangled it in a lawsuit
with another group that had plans to use at least part of the
vessel as a floating casino.
   The ship was taken over by federal marshals after Carter Green
Redd Inc. of Gulfport, Miss., sued for return of $47,000 it said it
paid for the rights to open a casino.
   Blaine Kern, a member of the foundation created to run the ship,
said the casino plan was nixed after the Spanish government, which
last owned the vessel, objected. He said a settlement with Carter
Green Redd Inc. is being pursued.
   The ship, commissioned in 1943, saw service in the Pacific until
the end of World War II, surviving two kamikaze attacks. Its crew
earned nine battle stars and the Presidential Unit Citation for
extraordinary heroism in action.
   In 1967, the Cabot was transferred to the Spanish government and
became the SNS Dedalo, flagship of the Spanish navy. It was retired
last year.
   ``It was sitting there just rusting away,'' said Legion member
Herb Wagner. ``The Spanish government said that if we would use it
as a joint Spanish-American museum, we could have it.''
   In 1989, the carrier steamed up the Mississippi River to New
Orleans where it was presented to the Cabot-Dedalo Museum
Foundation, made up of Kern, members of the Legion post, and
others.
   But when the foundation tried to dock the ship across from the
city's famous French Quarter, the Coast Guard balked.
   ``The currents along the west bank of the river are too
strong,'' Pfluger said.
   So the ship sits at a condemned wharf, where Wagner said it is
racking up $1,000 a day in docking fees.
   Its electricity was shut off when the foundation couldn't pay a
$4,100 bill, and it caught fire earlier this year, about the time
the federal government declared it a National Landmark. The fire
caused $15,000 damage.
   The fire damage is covered by insurance, Wagner said, but the
foundation owes the insurance company $40,000.
   When all the financial problems are sorted out the Legion hopes
to move the ship to nearby Kenner and begin renovations.
   ``We can't afford to quit now,'' Wagner said. ``We've got too
much in this thing. We've raised and spent three quarters of a
million dollars and we only have 89 members. We've done everything
but hold up convenience stores. Do you know how many bingo games
we've held?''

   About 80 foreigners, most of them Swedes,
left today aboard a chartered Iraqi Airways flight bound for
Stockholm, airport sources said.
   The flight included 65 Swedes, five Britons and and five Finns,
said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. They said
five or six other Westerners were on the flight, but that their
nationalities were not immediately known.
   Iraq has said that Swedes trapped by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait may leave if they wish. The Swedish Embassy in Baghdad said
Thursday two of its nationals have opted to stay.
   All the other Swedes who had been stranded in Kuwait or Iraq
since the invasion were on today's charter.
   President Saddam Hussein banned all foreigners from traveling in
response to a U.S.-led multinational military buildup against Iraq
after the invasion of Kuwait.
   But various groups of foreigners have since been allowed to
leave at the intervention of former or current politicians from
their countries or humanitarian organizations.
   About 1,300 Britons remain in stranded in Kuwait and Iraq, 350
of them interned at vital installations as human shields. Some 250
other foreigners, mainly Americans, also are being held in the
so-called human shields to guard against a possible attack by the
multinational force in the Persian Gulf.
   Meanwhile, the National Assembly, in a late Thursday night
session endorsed a call by Saddam to allow all Belgians to leave.
About 30 Belgians were stranded by the invasion, five of them
remain in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges Sharply Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged sharply against the yen Friday,
as market players sought a safe investment after the U.N. Security
Council adopted a resolution to permit the use of force to drive
Iraq from Kuwait.
   The weaker yen and possibility of war in the Middle East helped
push share prices down, dealers said.
   The dollar closed at 132.75 yen, up 2.60 yen from Thursday's
close of 130.15. After opening at 133.70 yen, it ranged from 132.40
to 133.85 yen in active trading totaling $18.44 billion.
   The dollar is traditionally seen as a safe investment in times
of international tensions, while the yen is weakened by possibility
of war in the gulf because Japan imports virtually all its oil.
   The dollar's jump followed its overnight advance in New York,
where it closed at 133.25 yen as investors anticipated the U.N.
decision.
   But buying slowed after the dollar hit the mid-133-yen levels
and a move to buy back the yen resurfaced, traders said.
   ``There is still a fundamental sense that the American economy
is in bad shape,'' said Yoshiyuki Kawai, a foreign exchange dealer
at the Tokai Bank.
   On the stock market, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed
at 22,454.63 points, down 257.97 points or 1.14 percent from
Thursday's finish of 22,712.60 points.
   Volume on the first section was 320 million shares, up from 300
million shares Thursday.
   Takuo Futamura of Sanyo Securities said the market's bearish
sentiments in the face of Middle East tensions resembled the way
share prices drooped during Emperor Hirohito's illness before his
death in January 1989.
   Investors are also wary of the declining trend in Japan's
economy, he said.
   ``We see severe times ahead,'' said a dealer at Cosmo
Securities, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 86.31 points as of 5 p.m. (3 a.m.
EST) from Thursday's close of 86.11 points. Their yield fell to
7.425 percent from 7.480 percent.

   People from Illinois to Arkansas are
divided over whether a climatologist's scientifically shaky
forecast of an earthquake during the next few days is cause to
party or reason to get all shook up.
   In some places, schools are closing. Disaster drills are being
staged. Sales of bottled water, canned food and earthquake
insurance have jumped.
   ``I think we have everything in place,'' said Elaine Van Horn of
Memphis, a believer whose family joined 11 others to put up a
stockpile of emergency food and camping gear. ``We've been working
on this probably since about August.''
   Others are amused.
   A rock band called the Rhythm Hounds planned a ``Shake, Rattle
and Quake'' night Sunday at the P&amp;H Cafe, a Memphis beer hall. A
pub called Zinnie's East advertised half-price specials Monday at
an ``It's Your Fault Earthquake Party.''
   In Falls City, Neb., the owner of a variety store recently ran
this advertisement: ``It's New Madrid's Fault: It's an Earthquake
Sale, Nov. 26 to Dec. 8, if we're still here. We're shaking down
our prices.''
   E-Day, if you will, is sometime around Monday. That's according
to New Mexico climatologist Iben Browning, who last summer said
there was a 50 percent chance of a strong quake on the New Madrid
Fault within 48 hours on either side of Dec. 3.
   The fault runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark., about 35
miles east of Memphis.
   ``It's nonsense,'' said Brian Mitchell, director of the
Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at St. Louis
University.
   An advisory panel to the U.S. Geological Survey said Browning's
forecast has no scientific merit. That word was tempered, however,
with the warning that a quake could happen at any time. It's just
that Dec. 3 has no special significance, the panel said.
   Memphis, with 650,000 residents, is the closest big city to the
fault, which produces more than 200 small earthquakes a year.
   Scientists give a 60 percent chance of a strong New Madrid
temblor over the next 15 years. Over 50 years, the probability is
better than 90 percent. But scientists say no one can predict the
exact day of an earthquake.
   Schools in parts of Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky and
Illinois canceled classes early next week. Officials at those
schools, generally in small towns and rural areas, say attendance
would be low if classes were held.
   Earthquake disaster drills have been staged throughout the
region, and many businesses expect more workers than usual to be
absent on Monday.
   Don Wood, a spokesman for the Memphis and Shelby County
Emergency Management Agency, said some residents apparently will
leave the area for a few days.
   ``I know people who say they're going to New Orleans and wonder
if the Mississippi River will flood them down there if the
earthquake hits here,'' Wood said.
   Browning, 72, bases his theory on the gravitational pull of the
sun and moon, which he says will be particularly strong during the
prediction period.
   If the New Madrid Fault does produce a strong quake one of these
days, it will likely be in the low 6-range on the Richter scale,
scientists say. A quake of that magnitude could cause serious
damage.
   The fault produced a series of such earthquakes in 1811 and
1812, their strength estimated at 8.0 or higher on the Richter
scale, which did not exist at the time. They were the strongest
earthquakes in U.S. history.

<HEAD>Nordics Ready for Soviet Refugees and Prepare for Worst</HEAD>

   Scandinavians have plans to quickly
erect refugee camps and reinforce their borders if a predicted
harsh winter brings a tide of Soviet refugees, officials say.
   But the Nordic countries are also readying food aid, with the
hope that if the Soviets are well-fed at home, they'll stay there.
   ``Our policy is to feed them ... so they don't have to come
across the border at all,'' said Asko Mattila, a Finnish Foreign
Ministry official.
   ``A worst, worst-case scenario, with a great migration, like
wolf packs welling over the border ... is not something we regard
as possible,'' said Bjorn Blokhus of the Norwegian Foreign
Ministry.
   A legislator in Moscow told Nordic parliamentarians last month
that up to 6 million Soviet refugees could head west in search of
better living conditions. Soviet officials say they have enough
food, but haven't been able to distribute it properly.
   Germany, motivated by wishes for Soviet stability as well as
gratitude for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's role in German
unification, has committed $19.5 billion in aid and credits to
Moscow. On Thursday Bonn decided to give the Soviets the $340
million in food and medical supplies that were stockpiled in West
Berlin after the 1948-49 Berlin Blockade.
   Swedish officials have developed a plan to put up emergency
shelters and extra security that could go into effect within 24
hours. It is described as an operation of last resort.
   Swedish Immigration Minister Maj-Lis Louw said the way to
prevent a flood of economic refugees is to make it clear ahead of
time they will not be accepted in Scandinavia, long known for
generous asylum laws.
   Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said the migration
of Soviet and Eastern European citizens could dwarf current refugee
problems.
   ``This problem will place huge demands on our resources,'' he
said.
   Although neither Denmark nor Sweden border the Soviet Union,
refugees could enter by ferry across the Baltic Sea. The recent
arrival in Finland of hundreds of Somalis who flew from Africa
through Moscow gave Nordic leaders a glimpse of what could happen
when the Soviet Union ends travel restrictions on its citizens.
   The Norwegian military has announced it is prepared to donate
the food, tents and medicines it has stockpiled for war to refugees
who might want to cross the 70-mile arctic border with the Soviet
Union.
   ``In a military sense, I don't think it (a Soviet food shortage)
has much significance, unless a civil war breaks out. And of
course, that is possible,'' said Dagfinn Danielsen, the northern
Norwegian military commander.
   Finnish officials deny news reports they plan to build refugee
camps or increase guards along the 800-mile border, the longest any
Western nation shares with the Soviet Union.
   ``We don't even consider it a possibility that thousands of
Soviets will rush across our border,'' said Gen. Matti Autio,
commander of the border guard.
   But the Finns will send thousands of tons of meat and potatoes
to the Soviet province of Karelia, which partly belonged to Finland
before World War II. The food shipment is a commercial deal,
though, not charity.
   ``I know those people very well. They are very hardy and a mere
food shortage is not going to drive them over here,'' said Teuvo
Korpelainen, county mayor in Tohmajarvi, 10 miles from the Soviet
border.
   Forecasts say temperatures may fall below minus 40 degrees this
winter in Karelia.
   ``It's the cold that will do it, if anything,'' said
Korpelainen. ``If they run out of heating oil and the temperature
falls to minus 40 degrees, then we'll see them over here.''
   In 1989, Finnish officials issued 65,000 visas to Soviets. More
than 200,000 have already been issued this year, because Moscow has
eased travel restrictions.
   Three new border posts have been temporarily opened, but Autio
said the 3,600-man guard force would not be strengthened.
   ``We can manage with the men we have,'' he said.

<HEAD>Newspaper's Lawsuit Accuses Drivers of Violent Conspiracy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS last graf to RESTORE `million.'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News has filed a $150 million
racketeering lawsuit accusing its striking unions of using violence
in an organized effort to win their demands or force the sale of
the newspaper.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court, claims the alleged
conspiracy included attempted murder, arson and robbery.
   Police officials have said they found no evidence of a
conspiracy in 229 incidents during the 5-week-old strike.
   The lawsuit claims strikers are using violence to achieve one of
two goals: forcing the tabloid into accepting wasteful contracts or
making it accept a union buyout plan.
   Named as defendants are the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers' Union
of New York and Vicinity; the Allied Printing Trades Council, the
umbrella group representing the nine striking unions, and 23
drivers.
   Theodore Kheel, the unions' unpaid legal adviser, said ``the
underpinning of this lawsuit was blown out of the water'' at a
state legislative hearing Monday when police officials testified
they had found no conspiracy.
   Nine of the tabloid's 10 unions representing some 2,100 strikers
began a walkout Oct. 25. The paper has published daily, but
distribution has been spotty, advertisers have pulled out and
delivery trucks and newsstands have been attacked.
   The lawsuit seeks $50 million in damages, which can be tripled
under racketeering law to $150 million if the newspaper wins.

   The German rush to help the Russians stave off a
hungry winter is rooted in the generosity of a wealthy country,
worry over a return to Stalinism in Moscow and a frank admission of
German guilt for World War II.
   Above all, Germany is thanking Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev for not blocking the unification of East and West
Germany.
   ``We know that on this difficult path to unity you were with us,
you helped us, and we are grateful,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
in a speech welcoming Gorbachev to Germany early this month.
   Although Gorbachev appealed publicly for more aid during his
visit, the German government was at first reluctant.
   Germany already had committed a whopping $19.5 billion in aid
and credits to Moscow, largely to finance the withdrawal of Soviet
troops from the formerly Communist eastern part of Germany.
   On Thursday, however, Germany took a step that gave rich meaning
to the treaty of friendship, non-aggression and cooperation that
Gorbachev and Kohl signed on Nov. 9, the first anniversary of the
opening of the Berlin Wall.
   The government decided to give the Soviets the mass of
foodstuffs and medical supplies that were built up in West Berlin
against a repeat of the 1948-49 Berlin Blockade, in which Josef
Stalin tried to starve the West's isolated island in Berlin. The
government values the reserve at $340 million.
   Kohl, in this decision, appeared to be several steps behind the
public, especially in Berlin, where the suggestion arose almost two
weeks earlier to give the Soviets the ``Berlin Reserve.''
   On Thursday, a planeload of 25,000 pre-packaged meals for
children's hospitals and orphanages flew from Hanover to Moscow in
the first shipment by German charities aimed at easing the chaotic
food situation in the Soviet Union.
   Organizers say the relief airlift will fly every day, an echo of
the immense U.S. and British airlift that saved West Berlin four
decades earier.
   At the same time, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper started
its own campaign - ``A Heart for Russia'' - encouraging the public
to assemble aid packets or donate $34 (50 marks) minimum to a
special Red Cross fund for Soviet hunger relief.
   Stefan Gaensicke, spokesman for the Axel Springer publishers
that own Bild, said the campaign sprang from the company's ``lone
crusade since 1958'' for German unity.
   ``When it finally came about, we knew damn well to whom we
really owe it all, to the man in Moscow who said, `It makes sense,
we'll have to let the East Germans go,' '' Gaensicke said.
   On Wednesday the grass-roots campaign took on an official
character. Kohl went on ZDF television to appeal for donations.
   The ZDF program showed empty Soviet stores, Russian women
fighting over blocks of cheese, and an expose of the
blackmarketeers who steal food, sometimes letting it rot if they
can't sell it.
   Stern magazine, allied with ZDF in the campaign, said Thursday
it was donating $340,000. Stern called on all Germans to help
rescue 20 million to 50 million Soviets from a ``Hunger Winter.''
   ``It is a commandment of humanity. Especially for us Germans,
who inflicted immeasurabee suffering on those people in World War
II. Twenty-six million Soviet citizens lost their lives,'' the
weekly's editorial said.
   It reported that some Soviets now say that under Stalin they at
least had bread, if not freedom. ``We cannot permit a new Stalin to
take power in the Kremlin, just because the hungry are screaming
for bread,'' Stern said.
   The German union of war-wounded and handicapped people, which
has 500,000 members, is supervising the delivery of aid packets to
old people's homes, groups of the handicapped and families with
small children.
   The German shippers' organization put out a call to its members
for trucks and expertise in surmounting the road, rail and
bureaucratic bottlenecks in the Soviet Union.

<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harry M. Caudill, an author whose 1963
expose of Appalachia's social and enviromental problems helped
inspire President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in the 1960s,
shot himself to death at age 68.
   The muckraking writer, lawyer, historian and state lawmaker died
Thursday. A friend said Caudill suffered from Parkinson's disease
and a World War II injury to his foot and had been depressed.
   Caudill's writings helped shape federal programs to control
strip mining, improve mine safety and eradicate poverty. His
``Night Comes to the Cumberlands'' in 1963 was credited with
bringing Appalachia's problems to the nation's attention.
   ``Coal has always cursed the land in which it lies. When men
begin to wrest it from the earth it leaves a legacy of foul
streams, hideous slag heaps and polluted air,'' Caudill wrote in
the book. ``It mars but never beautifies. It corrupts but never
purifies.''
   Johnson subsequently backed a wide range of social programs to
develop the region. The president used the Appalachian mountains as
a backdrop when he announced his War on Poverty at a tarpaper shack
near Inez in 1964.
   By last spring, Caudill had written 10 books, 80 newspaper
essays and editorials and some 50 magazine articles.
   ``Harry was always the one to challenge the unchallengable,''
said Ron Eller, director of the Appalachian Studies Center at the
University of Kentucky.
   ``He was the one to speak out and the one to confront the
corporations and the wealthy. That kind of courage is what made him
a champion to those in the region.''
   Caudill shot himself in the head with a pistol while seated in
his yard, which has a view of Pine Mountain, an imposing ridge he
cherished deeply.
   ``He did it in typical Harry style ... to go outside and be near
the mountains,'' said Edison Banks Jr., Letcher County assistant
commonwealth's attorney and a former student of Caudill's.
   His struggle with Parkinson's and a war wound restricted his
mobility in recent months, said Tom Gish, a publisher of The
Mountain Eagle newspaper in Whitesburg and a boyhood friend. Gish
said Caudill had been depressed.
   Caudill was born in Whitesburg, served in the Army and graduated
from the University of Kentucky College of Law in 1948.
   He championed education reform during three terms he served in
the Kentucky House, from 1954 to 1957 and from 1960 to 1962.
   He turned to writing in the early 1960s and taught Appalachian
history for eight years at the University of Kentucky until his
retirement in 1985.
   He is survived by his wife, Anne; a daughter, and two sons.

<HEAD>Woman Whose Case Led to More Freedom For Mental Patients Drowns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman whose court case gave West
Virginia's psychiatric patients freedom to live with as few
restrictions as possible drowned after wandering off during a visit
to a doctor, authorities say.
   Ella Hartley, 53, died Tuesday. She was last seen alive at an
Ohio River boat dock where she told bystanders she was going for a
swim, said police Capt. Paul Price.
   On Hartley's behalf, the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund,
a public advocacy group, filed a class-action lawsuit seeking more
freedom for mentally ill people able to care for themselves.
   In what became known as the Hartley decision, the Kanawha County
Circuit Court ruled in 1982 that mentally ill persons should be
kept in ``the least restrictive environment possible.''
   The decision resulted in Huntington State Hospital's mental
patient population falling from 1,500 to 90.
   ``The idea was that the mentally ill would do better if they
were placed in the community than they would if they were cooped up
in a mental institution,'' said Richard Christopher, a patient
advocate at the hospital.
   But he said the people released back into the community never
received the support and supervision they required, and that it
created the circumstances for an accident like Hartley's to occur.
   ``People kept coming back through the system, and somewhere
along the line someone is bound to get hurt,'' he said.
   State health officials refused to discuss Hartley's case.
   Hartley was a temporary patient at Huntington on Tuesday when a
hospital employee took her to a doctor's office nearby. Sometime
during the visit she left the escort's supervision.
   Her sister, Sue Davis, said that although Hartley maintained her
own apartment, she had frequently been hospitalized and a hearing
on whether to commit her had been scheduled for Thursday.
   She said her sister suffered from a chemical imbalance that
causes erratic behavior. The malady can be controlled with drugs,
but she said Hartley had apparently stopped taking them.
   John Ambrose of the National Mental Health Association in
Alexandria, Va., said the Hartley decision was part of a national
trend toward releasing mental patients that began in the 1970s.
   Sidney Kapantias of the Huntington Information and Referral
Service, a social service agency, said counselors there were well
aware of Hartley's role in changing the way the mentally ill are
cared for.
   ``It was always stunning to people to know that it was her
class-action lawsuit that facilitated the release of so many people
from mental hospitals,'' he said. ``Was she a victim of her own
law? I don't know.''

   A former U.S. soldier born in Kuwait was
behind bars today on charges of plotting to kill President Bush and
attack military bases.
   Jamal Mohamed Warrayat, 32, allegedly discussed with an
undercover FBI agent plans to kill Bush, as well as Secretary of
State James Baker and members of Congress.
   Court papers said he also conspired, as the leader of a group of
seven people, to attack unspecified military installations in North
Carolina and Texas.
   None of the others was named or charged Thursday.
   ``At this point in time there is no evidence to show that any
foreign government promoted or assisted in this activity,'' U.S.
Attorney Michael Chertoff said Thursday. He gave no motive or would
not comment further.
   Warrayat was held without bail at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center in New York. He could get up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine if convicted.
   Defense attorney Terence Scott said the charges stemmed from
Warrayat's ``ramblings'' and were not supported by evidence.
   Warrayat was born in Kuwait, moved to the United States in the
early 1970s, became a citizen and served about four years in the
Army until 1979, Scott said.
   Warrayat spoke to an undercover agent in late August, telling
the agent in Arabic that his group had weapons and materials to
carry out small terrorist operations, according to court papers.
   Warrayat wanted help getting explosives, money and technical
training and claimed to have drawings and diagrams of the military
targets that he made while in the Army, authorities said.
   Warrayat, who lives in Rutherford, worked as a taxi driver until
recently but was unemployed at the time of his arrest Tuesday,
Scott said.
   During a hearing in federal court in Newark, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Donna Gallucio said Warraya'st parents and other family
members live in Kuwait and Iraq and he has traveled to the Middle
East several times during the last six years.
   Gallucio said a search of Warrayat's home turned up a legally
purchased handgun.

<HEAD>U.N. Ultimatum Prompts Mixed Emotions Among Hostage Families</HEAD>

   Relatives of American hostages are agonizing over the U.N.
resolution aimed at driving Iraq from Kuwait, many noting that
while force may be the only answer, it will put the lives of their
loved ones in danger.
   The resolution, adopted by the U.N. Security Council on
Thursday, authorizes an attack if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
doesn't withdraw his troops from Kuwait and free all hostages by
Jan. 15.
   ``I've got a son over there and, of course, when the bullets
start flying he's in danger,'' said George Carroll of Winfield,
Kan. ``But I still think it's about all we can do. We can't let
this go on forever.''
   Carroll's son, a pediatric neurologist, is trapped in the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait.
   Some hostage families said the ultimatum itself might endanger
the estimated 900 Americans stranded in Iraq or Kuwait.
   Kristine Knutson said she is anxious about what Iraqi troops
might do in the face of a Jan. 15 deadline. Her husband has been in
hiding since the couple decided she and their four young children
should flee to Minnesota.
   ``For his peace of mind, it might help knowing there's a
deadline,'' said Ms. Knutson, who asked that her maiden name be
used to protect her husband's identity. ``But I wonder how (the
Iraqis) will react to the increased pressure.''
   David McDonald Jr., who has a close friend in hiding in Kuwait,
said he believes his friend, a Midwestern dentist, would support
the resolution.
   ``My friend is not a warmonger, but I think he realizes it's the
only realistic option if Saddam is to be stopped,'' he said.
   But Donnita Cole, who was among a group of hostage relatives
scheduled to visit the Iraqi capital of Baghdad next week, said she
cannot abide an offensive stance - at least not until every
diplomatic option is exhausted.
   ``I want to know what gives our president the power to decide
that on a certain date we're going to start a war,'' said Mrs.
Cole, whose husband is among Western hostages being held by Iraq as
``human shields'' to discourage an attack.
   ``What gives him the power in the month of November to say that
in January we're going to start a war?'' she asked. ``It should not
be an American military offensive as a presidential option but as
an act of Congress, and the people Congress is supposed to
represent.''
   ``At least (the resolution) puts some kind of a time frame on it
all,'' said Bonnie Anderton, whose husband has taken refuge at the
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
   ``But it's just another ratcheting of the stakes,'' Mrs.
Anderton said from Larkspur, Colo. ``And (Saddam) has said he's
going to ignore it.''
   Jennifer Williams, 21, who is planning a trip to Baghdad to
plead for freedom for her father and stepmother, said the deadline
is spurring her to do as much as she can while she still has the
chance. Her parents are being held as human shields.
   ``I think many people in my situation would do the same thing,''
said the student at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
   ``It's not an option. It's something I have to do,'' she said.
``I don't want my family to die in a war ... and because of this
deadline, I feel like I need to act quickly.''

<HEAD>48,000 Mine Workers Walk Out in Pay Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-eight thousand mine workers walked
off the job today in the largest strike since Turkey granted unions
the right to strike in 1963.
   The strike followed the breakdown in contract negotiations
between the Mine Workers Union and the state-owned Mine Research
Insitute and the Coal Mines Enterprise.
   In response, the employers said they will begin a lockout
Tuesday.
   Turkish papers reported today that the government had dispatched
special commando units of the army to the region to prevent any
violence in the province.
   In negotiations which lasted six months, the government
companies offered annual pay raises of about 75 percent. The unions
demanded that the wages be raised five-fold in view of high
inflation and what they deemed insufficient raises in the past.
   The average monthly wage for a miner working in the coal pits
was $180 and the union was demanding $900.
   Union president Hasan Huseyin Kayabasi told workers at the
largest mining area of Zonguldak that ``this strike is the start of
a process to get rid of those who have condemned workers to wages
of misery.''
   He was referring to the ruling Motherland Party and its policies
to keep wages low despite inflation of around 60 percent in recent
years.
   Contract talks broke off Wednesday after President Turgut Ozal,
founder of the Motherland, told reporters the workers were
demanding too much.
   After hearing Ozal's remark, union officials said there was no
use attending a meeting with Cabinet ministers designed to resolve
the pay dispute.
   Most of the striking workers are employed in coal mines in the
province of Zonguldak on the Black Sea Coast.

<HEAD>Mistrial Ruled in Faith Healing Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMITE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistrial was declared in the negligent
homicide case of a woman who relied on faith instead of medicine to
heal her leukemia-stricken son.
   District Judge Bruce Bennett declared a mistrial Thursday night
when the jury, after eight hours of deliberation, said it could not
reach a verdict.
   Anneta Williamson, 43, of Loranger, was tried in the 1989 death
of her 5-year-old son, Don. Mrs. Williamson is a member of a
fundamentalist Christian denomination that believes in curing the
ill through prayer and fasting.
   The prosecution did not immediately indicate whether it would
retry Mrs. Williamson.
   The defense had cited a 1985 law was designed to protect
Christian Scientists, who also practice faith healing. The law
holds that religious healing instead of medical treatment ``shall
not, for that reason alone, be considered to be criminally
negligent mistreatment or neglect of a child.''
   However, Assistant Attorney General Ken DeJean argued that the
1985 law does not apply in cases of negligent homicide.
   The prosecution's final witness, Dr. Sheila Moore, a specialist
in children's cancer, had testified that 60 percent to 70 percent
of children who develop leukemia recover.

   A huge fleet is hauling hundreds of
thousands of tons of tanks, cannons and other materiel to the
multinational force in Saudi Arabia in one of the biggest military
sealifts in history.
   Some 150 naval and merchant ships, now in a second wave as new
thousands of troops are sent to the region, have transported nearly
2 million tons of equipment and supplies to the 350,000-member
allied force since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Maj. Gen. William Pagonis, commander of military logistics for
Operation Desert Shield, said the sealift, augmented by a
3,000-plane airlift, is ``probably unheard of in history.
   ``In Vietnam, it took five or six years to have this many troops
on the ground. Even in Korea, they never moved this amount of
people and materiel this rapidly.''
   Between early August and mid-November, U.S.-chartered ships
carried more than 2,000 tanks, hundreds of other armored vehicles
and artillery guns, U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia say.
   Another 185,000 tons of materiel were airlifted from the United
States and Germany, along with 190,000 troops.
   Britain, France, Egypt and Syria also transported hundreds of
tanks, armored vehicles, guns, missiles and helicopters along with
thousands of troops in some 60 vessels.
   Now there's a second wave as President Bush bolsters U.S. forces
with another 200,000 troops, marines, sailors and airmen and all
their hardware.
   Close to 100 ships were involved in the first wave, about 60
percent of them government owned.
   ``It's a heyday for the merchant marine,'' said Cmdr. Jamie
Baldwin, who commands a group of naval reserve officers involved in
the sealift. ``Civilians are contributing substantially to the
sealift.''
   The first ships were the roll-on, roll-off ships of the U.S.
Maritime Prepositioning Squadron, which left the Indian Ocean
island of Diego Garcia, 2,100 miles east of the gulf, on Aug. 7.
The ships arrived Aug. 15.
   Next came the Afloat Prepositioning Force ships, also based in
Diego Garcia, which carried Army and Air Force Equipment. These
civilian-manned ships were followed by the Fast Sealift Support,
converted container ships that carried Army Infantry Division
equipment.
   Then came the Ready Reserve Force Ships, which were activated
for Operation Desert Shield.
   The last group included merchant ships chartered to the U.S.
government. They included various ship types, and included
foreign-flagged vessels.
   ``It was incredible,'' said a shipping executive based in Saudi
Arabia. ``One hundred vessels came in three months, an average of
one a day. I wouldn't think that even in World War II there was
such movement at such speed.''
   The United States has appealed to its NATO allies to provide
more ships and transport planes to move men and materiel to the
gulf. Naval officials have been quoted as saying most were
available at either commercial charter rates or for free.
   Most of the first wave of ships came 7,000 miles from the United
States. The U.S. government likened the task to moving a mid-size
city halfway around the world.
   The second wave is coming mainly from Europe, which cuts down
sailing time. By mid-January, the sealift is expected to have
transported three U.S. armored divisions from Germany.
   The eastern Saudi ports and Jubail, 150 miles south of the
Kuwaiti border, and Dammam, further south, are the main unloading
centers for the U.S. sealift.
   Pagonis said the huge, modern facilities there were a major
factor in keeping the flow running smoothly, with as many as 10
vessels unloading at a time on some days.
   The British, French, Egyptians and Syrians, which between them
have deployed or are sending more than 50,000 troops and hundreds
of tanks, use the Red Sea port of Yanbu.

   The continuing adventures of T. Milton
Street, the Traffic Court official who racked up 26 tickets while
driving without a license, found the self-proclaimed ``poor
people's hero'' without a job.
   Street was fired Thursday by Traffic Court President Judge
George Twardy for courtroom antics ``unbefitting a Traffic Court
employee.''
   Street on Wednesday had protested the handling of his case by
yelling at a Traffic Court judge, then sitting in her chair for
most of the afternoon.
   ``That is not right,'' Twardy said. ``I'm not going to stand for
it.''
   Last week, Twardy suspended Street after it was learned that he
has 26 outstanding tickets and owes $2,559 in fines. Street also
has not had a license or insurance for the past 11 years, Twardy
said.
   Street, a former state senator hired as assistant budget
director of Traffic Court last year, is challenging a rule that
requires payment before getting a Traffic Court hearing. He thinks
it is unconstitutional and unfair to poor people.
   Twardy also fired Street's son, T. Milton Street Jr., a court
officer suspended for not paying for nine tickets.
   The son accompanied his father during Wednesday's sit-in, which
ended when police asked them to leave as the office was closing for
the day.
   Street said he would challenge his firing.
   ``George Twardy hasn't heard the last of me,'' he said. ``I'm
going to be a hemorrhoid in his backside.''

   Fusao Harada has toiled most of his 60
years in a family rice paddy in this rustic village, stubbornly
surviving war, poverty and an only son who shuns farming.
   But his biggest challenge may be yet to come if the Japanese
government bows to U.S. pressure and decides to remove a ban on
imported rice that is much cheaper.
   Harada, a stocky man whose nearly six acres of land stretches
toward tree-covered hills on the eastern edge of Tokyo, says he is
ready to meet that challenge.
   ``As a farmer, I can't bear to see a rice field overgrown with
weeds,'' he said.
   But other farmers are less sanguine.
   ``Opening up the rice market will lead to the destruction of
Japanese farming,'' said Teiichi Tanaka, 63, a farmer from Niigata
prefecture in central Japan. Competition with cheap U.S. imports
would be akin to ``making a toddler fight against a sumo
wrestler.''
   The Japanese government has long protected its farmers by
banning virtually all rice imports, claiming the country needed to
remain self sufficient in its staple grain. The price of Japanese
rice is about 2.4 times that of U.S. rice, according to Agriculture
Ministry statistics.
   Pressure has been applied on Japan to show its commitment to
free trade by gradually easing the ban. Vice President Dan Quayle
made a pitch for opening the market during a November meeting with
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in Tokyo.
   The issue may come to a head in December during a crucial
international meeting on trade in Brussels.
   Many farmers are predicting dire consequences for Japanese
agriculture if the ban is lifted. They claim they cannot compete
with imports because the economies of scale of huge U.S. farms are
impossible on the tiny plots of arable land squeezed between
Japan's many mountains.
   But the farmers' troubles actually began brewing long before the
threat of rice imports materialized. The Japanese diet has been
shifting from rice toward meat and bread, and farming villages have
been turning into ghost towns as the younger generation heads for
big cities.
   ``I am going to be the last farmer in this family,'' lamented
Tanaka, whose son is a white-collar worker.
   Japan now has 5.9 million farmers, 1 million less than a decade
ago, who comprise only 8 percent of the working population.
Rice-growing farmland has declined by about 741,000 acres during
that period, as paddies have given way to factories and new homes.
   Nationwide farmers' groups remain powerful because the Japanese
political system gives rural areas strong electoral clout, and the
government's official line on the ban has yet to waver.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said the international
community should recognize Japan's need to maintain food security
through domestic production.
   ``Japan is going to emphasize again (in the December trade
talks) that Japan is the largest importer of agricultural goods in
the world and also that the self-sufficiency rate is the lowest
among the industrialized countries,'' Watanabe said.
   Many Japanese also see rice farming as central to their culture,
because rice plays a central role in Shinto, the country's native
religion.
   Still, an increasing number of influential politicians are
saying that the market should be opened to imports. Many farmers
believe it is only a matter of time before the ban is removed.
   In addition to U.S. demand for liberalized trade policies, the
political clout of rural areas is likely to decline because of the
dwindling farm population and planned electoral reforms.
   One 68-year-old woman, whose son chose to run a pastry store in
a former rice paddy instead of cultivating the family land, gave up
rice farming five years ago. Now she works alone in a garden near
her home in Kamogawa, raising strawberries, cabbage and scallions.
   ``Japanese farming is finished,'' she said with a sigh before
returning to her gardening.

<TEXT>
   After four decades of rigged elections that gave
the Communists a numbing succession of imaginary landslides,
eastern Germans are suddenly awash in the freedom to choose.
   On Sunday, they will join their western countrymen for the first
united German elections since 1932.
   It is the fourth free and fair election in the past 10 months in
what used to be East Germany, however, and some people have lost
their enthusiasm for ballot casting.
   ``I won't vote Sunday,'' said Andrea Fischer, who also skipped
the last two elections. ``The more I know about these parties, the
more they seem almost comical.''
   After overthrowing the Communist hard-liners, East Germans
jubilantly chose a democratic government in March. In May, they
elected new local leaders, throwing out hundreds of Communists
still clinging to power.
   On Oct. 14 - a scant 11 days after German unification - they
chose the governments for the five states their nation had become.
   But with another historic chapter about to be written Sunday, a
definite air of apathy hangs over the former nation.
   Some of it has to do with the seeming inevitability of the
outcome. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose conservative Christian
Democratic Union dominated the first three races in eastern
Germany, is expected to handily retain his post.
   A little of it has to do with a growing familiarity with
democratic political campaigns. The novelty has worn off, the
euphoria is gone. Political rhetoric is greeted with Western-style
cynicism.
   Most of all, pressing problems have come to dwarf the small
thrill of voting. The eastern Germans are expecting a dramatic
surge in joblessness as their sputtering enterprises use up what
little credit they have left in coming months.
   ``I have a child and a job that I only work four hours a day,''
said Ms. Fischer, 33, a postal employee who lives in the village of
Schildow, north of Berlin.
   ``I just believe my vote won't make a difference,'' she said.
   Ms. Fischer, who would have supported the environmental Greens
party or the left-leaning Social Democrats, says she believes even
they don't have a strong enough message to lure her to a voting
booth on Sunday.
   Karin Wernecke, a 30-year-old Berliner and former Communist,
will vote as she always has: for the Communists, now reformed and
renamed the Party of Democratic Socialism.
   ``We won't win, but we need this voice,'' she said. Ms.
Wernecke, a single jobless mother, says she has little hope for the
future under the Christian Democrats.
   Harry Schneidereit is one of the optimists. At 65, he has a
chance to finally do what he always wanted to do.
   ``I have been a watchmaker for 40 years,'' said Schneidereit,
who runs a small shop in northern Berlin. ``This is the first time
in my life I can decide what I want. This is the essence of life
for a shopkeeper.''
   Schneidereit could not visit his parents in West Berlin after
the wall was built. He had to let the government decide what he
could stock in his shop, what prices to charge, how much he could
pay his employees.
   Now he has a new product line but is struggling to compete with
the lower prices of the big retailers.
   Still, he said he would have it no other way. That's why, he
said, Sunday's election is important: To continue the former
nation's evolution.
   ``It is important that we have no apathy,'' he said. ``This man,
this big man, he has promised that he would help and now he should
help. This is the way to hold him to his promise.''
   The ``big man'' is the rotund giant Kohl, who promised East
Germans both unity and Western-style prosperity if they elected his
party in March.
   Unity came, but prosperity still has not.
   Schneidereit detects apathy among the people in his shop,
stunned by the realization that times are hard and things are
likely to worsen before they get better.
   Schneidereit will vote for Kohl, but he says eastern Germans
themselves carry much of the burden for making the chancellor's
promises come true.
   ``We can't say `Oh, we poor people,' '' he said. ``Look at the
Soviet Union.
   ``We have to find the right way,'' he said. ``We have to take
our destiny into our own hands.''

   NBC is still king of the hill after claiming its
11th straight ratings sweeps victory. It has surrendered the top
position only once in 23 tries since 1985.
   Nobody was surprised and few outside the network were very
impressed when NBC claimed its latest victory Thursday in the
monthlong viewership tallies held each November, February, May and
July.
   Sweeps figures, bolstered by blockbuster programming like major
motion pictures, entertainment specials and other choice shows,
help TV stations set their advertising rates.
   ``The purpose of the sweeps is really to provide numbers that
our local stations can sell,'' said Robert Niles, NBC's vice
president for research. ``This is a nice victory.''
   It was a smaller, narrower victory than in past NBC wins. The
other networks noted that NBC's winning margin was 13 percent lower
than in 1989. ``While we may have slowed down, year to year,
nobody's passed us,'' Niles said.
   NBC won prime time with a 13.1 average rating and a 22 share;
ABC was second by a tick, with a 12.8 rating and 21 share; and No.
3 CBS had a 12.0 rating and a 20 share.
   A ratings point represents 931,000 television households in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. survey; a share represents the percentage of all
television sets tuned to a show in its time period.
   Among high-profile sweeps shows, NBC had the month's top-rated
theatrical movie, ``Three Men and a Baby,'' and the two-part
made-for-TV movie ``The Big One.'' ABC had the second-highest rated
movie, the made-for-TV ``Stephen King's `It''' and ``Crocodile
Dundee.''
   Limited success in the movie category cost CBS, said David
Poltrack, the network's senior vice president for audience
research.
   ``The major reason for CBS being third in the sweeps is that you
have to go all the way down (the list) to No. 6 to find CBS,'' he
said.
   For Fox Broadcasting Co., which had added two nights of
programming this season, its 6.6 rating and 11 share had to be a
disappointment, one industry analyst said.
   Fox boosted its ratings just a tenth of a point and its audience
share by just 1 percent over last November's sweeps.
   ``The sweeps numbers just confirm that with an expanded lineup,
it's getting tougher to compete,'' said David Marans, senior
audience researcher for the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency.
   ``CBS almost had twice the audience that Fox did,'' he said.
``Any plans that Fox had for further expansion have to be
questionable, if they're only competitive on one or two nights
now.''
   Fox officials did not immediately return phone calls seeking
their reaction to the November sweeps.
   NBC's victory comes with just over 1 million more households
tuned in than third-place CBS, and a 2 percent larger share of the
audience. No. 2-rated ABC had only about 280,000 fewer housholds
tuned in and a 1 percent smaller share.
   ``It's the closest we've been to first place in a non-Olympics
year since 1984,'' said Alan Wurtzel, ABC's senior vice president
for research. ``Basically, NBC and ABC are the same.''
   NBC's narrow win signals possible change in the network ratings
game, Marans said.
   ``If you look at the demographics, ABC is pretty much on its way
to becoming the leader in prime time,'' he said.

<HEAD>A Pension and Half an Office From a Grateful Nation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher, the longest serving British
leader this century, has been rewarded for her 11{ years in power
with a pension about equal to the salary of a well-paid London
secretary.
   She will also receive a private office at Parliament, but only
so long as she remains a Parliament member.
   Beyond that, the only perks of former office will be a limousine
and a security detail. Since she could be a target of the Irish
Republican Army for decades, security could cost the government
hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
   Her pension of $34,185 a year - roughly the earnings of a senior
secretary in central London - is calculated according to a
procedure laid down in 1937, a government spokesman said.
   It provides that a prime minister gets a pension amounting to 15
fortieths of his or her pay, irrespective of length in office.
   Because she is still a member of the House of Commons for the
north London district of Finchley, the 65-year-old Mrs. Thatcher
also gets the $52,066 salary of a legislator, bringing her total
government income to $86,252.
   Mrs. Thatcher has crammed the filing cabinets for her Finchley
constituency into the tiny office at the House of Commons of a
fellow legislator, Peter Morrison, said her former press secretary,
Bernard Ingham.
   She is using space in Morrison's shared office at the Commons
but is due to be given a larger one for herself as the ex-prime
minister. That, too, will go if she leaves the 650-member Commons.
Space is at a premium and most legislators have to share.
   Meanwhile, admirers have got together to provide her with a
privately funded set of offices in a building near the Houses of
Commons.
   Her aides say she is hoping to set up a Margaret Thatcher
Foundation, dedicated to promoting her views on free markets and
private enterprise. The foundation would pay for the office.
   The salary of the prime minister is $130,395, but Mrs. Thatcher,
who is married to a retired millionaire, chose to be paid $107,680,
the same as other Cabinet members.
   Britain's four other surviving ex-prime ministers, Harold Wilson
and James Callaghan of the Labor Party, and Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative Party predecessor, Edward Heath, also retired on the
15-fortieths of their prime ministerial salaries at the time. The
pensions are raised annually in line with inflation.

   General Motors Corp. is cutting production for
the second time this month because of slumping demand and says it
expects to suffer its first quarterly operating loss this year
since recession-wracked 1981.
   GM did not say how many of the automaker's 280,000 hourly
workers will be laid off to accomplish the cutback in production.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel told a Fort Wayne, Ind., business
group on Thursday night that the world's leading automaker expects
its fourth-quarter operating results ``will decline significantly''
from the third quarter.
   GM spokesman Terrence Sullivan in Detroit said the chairman's
statement ``certainly implies'' GM will have a fourth-quarter
operating loss.
   An operating loss differs from a net loss. Net earnings or
losses reflect, in addition to earnings on a company's core
operations, such factors as the sale of assets, the cost of plant
closings and various accounting practices.
   GM did not say whether it would post a net loss.
   While the automaker posted a record net loss of $2 billion in
the third quarter, that was due to a $2.1 billion writeoff for
plant closings, which overwhelmed a $109 million profit on its
truck- and auto-making operations.
   The automaker announced earlier this month it was cutting
fourth-quarter production by 181,000 vehicles. Stempel said
Thursday that GM was reducing production by an additional 111,000
cars and trucks.
   The reductions will leave GM with plans to build 1.07 million
cars and trucks at its U.S. and Canadian plants during the fourth
quarter, which ends Dec. 1.
   GM declined to say which of the company's 100 plants in North
America would be affected. As a result of the cutback, GM will make
144,000 cars and trucks in December, 40 percent fewer than what it
had previously planned to build.
   Under the GM contract, laid-off workers get 95 percent of their
salary.
   Stempel said the lower production reflects an erosion of
consumer confidence stemming in part from the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Many people have been taking a `wait and see' attitude toward
major purchase decisions. For the auto industry, this has
translated into weaker automotive demand that has meant temporary
plant shutdowns and layoffs,'' he said.
   ``What GM is saying is that `We are not going to get caught with
a surplus of cars that we have to sell (with) extreme rebates and
have to shut the plants down in January and February,' as they did
in 1990,'' said auto industry analyst Arvid Jouppi of Arvid Jouppi
Associates Inc. in Detroit.
   Analyst Ronald Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San
Francisco predicted GM would post a net loss of $150 million to
$250 million for the quarter.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car thief confined to his home by an electronic
ankle bracelet lured a man to his apartment with the promise of a
drug deal, then robbed and murdered him, police said.
   Samuel Santiago, 18, also robbed a pizza deliveryman in front of
his apartment while under the electronic supervision of prison
officials, police said.
   The ankle bracelet transmits a signal to a receiver attached to
the telephone if the prisoner moves outside a 100-foot radius of
the phone.
   ``He knew just how far he could go without setting off the
alarm,'' police Sgt. Ron Rewers said Thursday.
   Santiago was charged Thursday with murder and two counts of
armed robbery. He was jailed today without bail.
   Santiago began serving a three-year sentence for car theft in
1989 and a month ago was accepted into a home imprisonment program
that includes 460 felons, said Nic Howell, a state Corrections
Department spokesman.
   On Monday, Santiago fatally shot Rudy DelCastillo, 18, at the
entrance of his home after an accomplice, Federico Conde, 18, lured
the victim there by offering to sell him drugs, police said.
   Santiago and Conte allegedly robbed the man of gold chains and
more than $1,000 in cash. Conde also was charged with murder and
armed robbery.
   The night before the shooting, a pizza deliveryman was robbed at
gunpoint while making a delivery to Santiago's home, Detective A.
Perez said.
   Howell said this was the first serious criminal charge made
against a participant in the home imprisonment program, which was
started in 1989 as a way to ease prison overcrowding and has had
1,800 participants.
   Officials monitor inmates 24 hours a day via the telephone
receivers, which signal Correction Department computers if
prisoners stray, Howell said.
   Only non-violent offenders are selected, Howell said.
   ``This one incident should not bear on the rest of the
program,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq today rejected a U.N. Security Council
ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait by mid-January and vowed to teach
the United States and its allies a ``hard lesson, unprecedented in
history.''
   State-run Baghdad Radio interrupted regular programming to
broadcast what it described as ``an important announcement'' by the
ruling Revolutionary Command Council led by President Saddam
Hussein.
   The statement said the Security Council endorsement Thursday
night of the use of force against Iraq if it does not leave Kuwait
by Jan. 15 was ``illegal, null and void'' because Baghdad said it
was imposed by the United States.
   ``It is first and foremost an American decision in which certain
powers participated only under American pressure,'' said the
announcement, monitored in Nicosia. ``The United States practiced
all forms of pressure, terrorism and bribes'' to pass the
resolution.
   The measure was approved by a 12-to-2 vote. It was opposed by
Cuba and Yemen, the only Arab member on the 15-member Security
Council. China abstained.
   The Baghdad announcement noted that the council had failed to
end Israeli occupation of Arab territories and said this was one of
the reasons why Arab masses would reject the latest resolution
against Iraq.
   ``The Iraqi people reject this injustice and are ready to fight
in the defense of their territory,'' the announcement said,
referring to Kuwait, which Iraq annexed after the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Iraqis now refer to Kuwait as their 19th province.
   ``This nation of impossible missions will teach all those
(arrayed against Iraq) a hard lesson unprecedented in history,''
the announcement said.
   ``Millions of Iraqis are committed to confronting tyranny and
injustice.'' Before the Security Council session, Saddam said Iraq
would not be intimidated by a resolution authorizing military
action against it. He insisted that his armed forces had the
technology to defeat sophisticated American weapons, such as the
Stealth fighter bomber.
   ``The Americans are still influenced by Rambo movies, but this
is not a Rambo movie. This is something different,'' Saddam said on
Thursday.
   ``It is a shameful resolution, tarnished with the scandals that
have transformed the Security Council into a cover for U.S.
hegemony and a theater for its dirty deals,'' the Revolutionary
Command Council statement said.
   ``The double standards of these powers have become crystal clear
after the latest resolution,'' it said.
   It reiterated a call for ``a dialogue'' to resolve the Kuwait
crisis and the Palestinian question on ``the basis of equality and
mutual respect.''

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season had more storms
than usual and some forecasters predict that's just a hint of more
frequent and more forceful hurricanes in the coming years.
   But this year's batch did not include the devastating storms of
years past and at least one forecaster thinks 1991 will be a calmer
year. The season ends today.
   Dr. William Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado
State University, thinks a dry spell in West Africa during the past
two decades explained the reduction of storms along the eastern
seaboard in the last 20 years.
   In 1988 and 1989, there was near normal rainfall in the Sahel,
the semi-arid land on the southern fringe of the Sahara Desert.
Some meteorological experts think the rainfall signaled the end of
a 20-year drought - and may have spawned Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo
in 1989.
   Gray on Thursday predicted a below-average hurricane season in
1991. He based his forecast on several factors, including an
anticipated below-average rainfall in the Sahel.
   But Gray and other forecasters agree that the general outlook
for the 1990s and the early years of the next century is for more
intense hurricanes than those of the last two decades.
   ``We've been through a real long period of hurricane inactivity
in the '70s and '80s up until 1985, and I think we're coming out of
that,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center
in Coral Gables.
   ``Perhaps the Gilberts and the Hugos were signaling that,'' he
said, recalling Hurricane Gilbert that wracked the Caribbean and
Hurricane Hugo that devastated South Carolina - two of the most
destructive Atlantic hurricanes ever.
   Hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic every month except
April, but are rare outside the hurricane season, June 1 to Nov.
30.
   In this year's season, there were 14 named storms, eight of them
hurricanes. The average number of storms is nine, with about six
becoming hurricanes. Usually only a couple of those storms strike
the U.S.
   While many of the storms spun harmlessly through the Atlantic,
several caused their share of destruction.
   The most deadly storm was Hurricane Diana, which swept into
Mexico in early August, resulting in flash floods and mudslides
that killed 96 people and caused extensive damage to roads,
property and agriculture, the weather service reported.
   A weather disturbance becomes a tropical storm, and is given a
name, if its sustained winds reach 39 mph. Storms become hurricanes
if winds reach 74 mph.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Does Drawing a Line in The Sand Make War
Inevitable?
^An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deadline is set. The United Nations is
giving Iraq until Jan. 15 to pull out of Kuwait or face forcible
eviction.
   But war is not inevitable even though a line was drawn in the
sand Thursday by the Security Council. Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein has nearly seven weeks to withdraw his troops - and avert a
war.
   Congressional Democrats are unlikely to relent in their
determination to restrain the Bush administration.
   Former U.S. military commanders have questioned the wisdom of
going to war with Iraq. And diplomats of various persuasions will
redouble their efforts now to convince Saddam to release his hold
on Kuwait.
   ``We do not stop the diplomatic and political efforts now at
all,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III said after the
Security Council vote.
   ``We have, in fact, a pause here for peace that will permit us
to continue to pursue these efforts,'' he said as he headed to
dinner with the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, China,
Britain and France ``to explore with them what their ideas are.''
   As the council rolled to its 12-2 vote in favor of the U.S.
resolution - China abstained - speaker after speaker stressed not a
military solution to the crisis but the possibility that Saddam
would take the world's threats seriously.
   Canadian Foreign Minister Joseph Clark said the resolution gave
the Iraqi leader ``an opportunity to reflect.''
   ``It is up to Iraq; it is not too late,'' Clark said.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the resolution a
clear message that ``we are making a strong bid for peace on the
basis of him withdrawing'' from Kuwait.
   And Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said ``we
want to begin a pause of good will.''
   In an otherwise tough speech to the council, the Soviet foreign
minister called on Saddam ``to rise above considerations of
prestige, to display wisdom and foresight.''
   Shevardnadze said it was ``time to think again.''
   Baker has ruled out partial solutions and insisted on
unconditional retreat from Kuwait.
   So that appears to leave little room for diplomacy to work.
There would seem to be no face-saving device for the Iraqi leader
to grasp.
   And yet, Baker said that while Saddam should not reap rewards
for aggression, ``that should not be equated with an unwillingness
to pursue diplomatic and political approaches.''
   Baker gave no hint what approaches might be considered in the
days before Jan. 15. But a careful look at the resolution shows
there is a lot of room for maneuver.
   ``Yes, it authorizes the use of force,'' Baker noted. ``I would
remind you that it doesn't require it. It's our view that this is
the best way to give peace a chance, if you will.''
   Forty years ago, when the U.N. Security Council decided to act
against North Korea, the member nations adopted a resolution
calling on all states to ``repel'' the invasion of South Korea.
   The resolution approved Thursday simply authorizes the taking of
``all necessary means'' to implement the 11 other resolutions
approved by the council since the Aug. 2 invasion.
   That suggests the 12 nations that voed for the resolution want
to avert a clash. There is no direct reference to war in the text.
   ``No one here has sought this conflict,'' Baker said.
   Rather than callin the resolution a mandate for war, Baker
called it ``a pause for peace.''
   And yet, Jan. 15 is a deadline.
   After that day, President Bush, Saddam and other key actors in
this dangerous drama will find it very difficult to avoid making
the hard choices they have postponed so far.
   For Bush, the deadline means he cannot wait much later without
undermining the credibility of his own military threat.
   As for Saddam, stalling any further is a dare to come and get
him.

   A jury that acquitted a man of attacking
a police officer recommended police and prosecutors apologize for
arresting him.
   When the Jackson County jurors issued the unusual statement this
week, they didn't know that Ronald L. Webb, 21, had been held in
jail after being unable to pay a $100,000 bond from the time of his
arrest Aug. 1 until the verdict.
   Jurors found out later that Webb was in jail during the birth of
his third child. And they did not know police sold his car from the
city tow lot because being in jail had kept him from claiming it by
a deadline.
   The jurors apparently believed the defense contention that a
rookie police officer lied in her testimony to avoid being
disciplined.
   After deliberating for about an hour Wednesday the jury asked
for more time to compose a statement. A few minutes later, jury
foreman Gene Scott read the statement, which said ``an apology is
in order to Mr. Webb and his family for any hardships or
inconvenience'' caused by the arrest.
   Police Chief Steve Bishop said police had probable cause to make
an arrest, and ``no apology is necessary.''
   Jurors found Webb innocent of charges of first degree assault on
a law enforcement officer and armed criminal action. If convicted,
he could have received up to a life sentence on each count.
   Webb, who faces court dates on several driving violations, had
been taken to a police station June 21 for a traffic ticket, and
admittedly walked away to avoid being arrested for driving with a
suspended license. At that point, police charged he got into his
car and tried to run down Officer Clarissa Hager. She was not
injured.

<TEXT>
   A Korean immigrant who pleaded guilty to
selling fake designer purses has been ordered to learn English
during the next year as part of his probation.
   Interpreter Yong Spears told U.S. District Judge Tom Stagg that
Bup Song Choe, 35, of Irving, Texas, will ``try best'' to learn the
language.
   ``Try best, nuts!'' Stagg responded during a hearing Wednesday.
He told Choe that he must learn English during his one-year
probation, with his probation officer reporting on his progress.
   Choe brought fake Louis Vuitton, Gucci and MCM purses to
Shreveport from Dallas and sold them to a local merchant.
   His attorney, Gary Udashen of Dallas, asked for a light
sentence, saying a prison term of a year or more could keep Choe
from becoming a U.S. citizen.
   ``He loves America as well as his own country. He wants to be
American citizen,'' said Choe's wife, who also showed Stagg a
photograph of their sons, Robert and Sam. The boys and Mrs. Choe,
whose first name could not be obtained from the court, are U.S.
citizens.
   ``It's a good thing that you want to become a citizen, but it's
also true that you were a guest in this country when you broke its
laws,'' Stagg told Choe.

   From the paratroopers who landed
on the first plane to the newest arrivals in the desert, U.S.
troops today welcomed a U.N. deadline allowing force if Iraq fails
to leave Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   ``It gives the soldiers a focus for the future. People now have
something to key in on,'' said Capt. Michael Langman, 26, of
Headquarters Co. of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division.
   Langman, of New York City, was among the first paratroopers to
set foot on a Saudi airstrip nearly four months ago as part of
Operation Desert Shield. The 82nd was considered a tripwire if
Saddam Hussein chose to expand his agression beyond Kuwait and into
Saudi Arabia.
   ``Now that they're talking about an offensive, it looks like
we've got a mission again,'' Langman said. ``Guys want to kick some
butt.''
   Air Force Sgt. Scott Grant, 25, of Toledo, Ohio, arrived in
Saudi Arabia on Thursday. But he was just as eager to learn that
the United Nations had issued an ultimatum.
   ``Now something's going to be done,'' Grant said.
   The biggest boost about the U.N. action is knowing a date for
something to happen, according to soldiers who have been sweating
it out in the desert.
   ``The worst part of all has been not knowing,'' said Lt. Jackie
Jones, 25, of Springfield, Va., part of a Patriot missile battery
with the Army's 18th Airborne Corps.
   ``This sets a date. It gives us a timeline. It's a big
motivating factor,'' she said. ``The longer you stay over here with
nothing happening, the more lax you're likely to be.
   ``We're not here to babysit,'' said Ms. Jones. ``We'd just like
to get on about our business and go home.''
   At least one serviceman felt the vote gave Saddam too much time,
which the Iraqi president can use to dig in and better his
defenses.
   ``It should have been done two months ago. I hope it happens
tomorrow,'' said Seaman Steven Simpson of Hartford, Conn., part of
the U.S. Navy's Seabees Construction Battalion.
   ``We've given this guy ample opportunities to withdraw from
Kuwait. Who knows if there's a Kuwait left? He stripped it down. He
pillaged the whole country. He deserves what's going to happen to
him,'' Simpson said.

   Japan will provide its first medical assistance to
the Soviet Union since World War II to help ease shortages there
this winter, the Foreign Ministry announced today.
   Japan will also supply $19.5 million worth of equipment and
technological help for victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster, said ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the medical assistance would be worth much less than the aid for
Chernobyl victims, which is being funneled through the World Health
Organization.
   Japan has had a policy of not extending financial aid to Moscow
until it agrees to return a group of islands it seized from Japan
at the end of World War II. But the medical assistance will be
extended on humanitarian grounds, Foreign Ministry officials said.
   The Soviet Union also is seeking emergency food from the
international community this winter.
   ``We'd like to watch the situation in regard to the food
situation,'' Watanabe said. ``We have no evidence that we should
give emergency food aid,'' he added, citing reports of a bumper
Soviet wheat harvest this year.
   Soviet officials say they are having trouble distributing the
food because of bottlenecks and bureaucratic conflicts.

<TEXT>
   There's a new sheriff in town. And it's high
noon for scofflaws who owe $4 billion in fines to the strapped
city.
   Philip Crimaldi took over the city's antiquated and underused
sheriff's office on July 30. He's been leaning hard on scofflaws
ever since.
   ``I'm not in a personality contest,'' he said.
   City agencies issue a plethora of summonses: to building and
fire code violators, litterbugs, illegal vendors, store owners with
dirty sidewalks, pet owners who refuse to scoop, noisy nightclubs,
restaurants that emit foul odors.
   New York uses its own employees, outside collection agencies,
city marshals and, on rare occasions, the sheriff's office to shake
money out of scofflaws.
   But the sheriff's office, which has the most legal power,
collected only $2 million last year.
   Crimaldi, who says most people don't even know New York HAS a
sheriff, collected $5.5 million in the past four months. All of it
previously was deemed uncollectible by private collectors, who
concentrate on the easiest pickings.
   ``An astronomical number of people in the city disregard
summonses of all types,'' Crimaldi said.
   ``Whether you live in Dubuque, New York, Detroit or San Diego,
when you get a parking ticket on your windshield, your first
instinct - it may be a primal instinct - is to tear it up,''
conceded mayoral spokesman Lee Jones.
   Jones ought to know. Seven years ago, his mind was on personal
problems instead of alternate-side-of-the-street parking
regulations. He ended up paying $2,200 in fines.
   ``The city of New York's going to get what's due,'' said Jones.
``Those who don't pay mean the rest of us have to pay more.''
   Realistically, said Crimaldi, about $800 million of the $4
billion owed the city is collectible. The rest, though still on the
books, is up to 20 years old.
   Parking violations are the biggest category; as of Tuesday,
unpaid tickets totaled $1.6 billion. Some of those have been on the
books eight years.
   The new sheriff's approach is simple. He finds out who owes
money. He sends a letter, threatening to seize their bank account,
car and other assets.
   Then he takes it.
   ``We've raided stores and found the city's dunning notices
wrapped in bundles in the safe,'' said Crimaldi. ``They'd get a
notice, another notice and another notice. Nothing ever happened.
Word spread, merchant to merchant: `They're not going to get you.'
   ``Well, now, hello and surprise!''

<TEXT>
   The father of an 8-year-old girl embroiled in
a bitter parental court fight says it is ``meaningless'' to
continue the battle following a New Zealand decision awarding
custody to his former wife.
   Eric Foretich, a Northern Virginia oral surgeon, said the
decision giving Elizabeth Morgan custody of their daughter Hilary
means ``one of us is going to have to give up, and I guess it's
going to be me. It's meaningless to continue. What's the point?
   ``I can't physically take her from New Zealand, and I'm not
going to move there,'' Foretich said.
   Under the terms of a court order issued by New Zealand family
court Judge P.D. Mahoney, Morgan must remain with her daughter,
Hilary Foretich, in Christchurch, New Zealand, WUSA-TV and WRC-TV
reported late Thursday.
   She also must report to the court every six months on the girl's
progress and refrain from any further publicity about the case, the
stations said.
   In New Zealand, there was no announcement today of any court
decision. Such decisions are often kept secret, and New Zealand law
provides strict penalties for violating gag orders. Hilary's legal
representative in the case, Isabel Mitchell, would make no comment
Friday night.
   Morgan separated from Foretich before Hilary was born. Later, in
a custody battle publicized around the world, she accused him of
sexually abusing the child. Foretich has denied the allegations.
   When District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon
ordered Morgan to allow Foretich to visit her daughter, she sent
Hilary into hiding with her grandparents and went to jail for more
than two years.
   Mahoney said he ruled in Morgan's favor despite what he said
were serious reservations about the negative attitudes she had
fostered in her daughter, the television stations reported.
   The judge reportedly said there was a strong argument for saying
the child should remain in her mother's care, where her physical,
educational, spiritual and emotional needs are being met.
   Morgan's brother, Robert Morgan, declined to comment late
Thursday. Her attorney, Stephen Sachs, also refused to comment,
saying a gag order had been imposed in the case.

<HEAD>Report: Five Possibly Targeted in Kahane Suspect's List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI officials have warned five New York leaders
that their names were found on a list kept by the man accused of
killing Israeli extremist Rabbi Meir Kahane, according to a
published report.
   The list included Rep. Gary Ackerman, two federal judges, a
former assistant U.S. attorney and a columnist for the weekly
Jewish Press, New York Newsday said in today's editions.
   FBI officials believe El Sayyid Nosair acted alone when he
gunned down Kahane during a Nov. 5 meeting at a midtown hotel, but
are still trying to determine whether he was backed by a terrorist
group.
   The list appears to strengthen the theory that the killing of
Kahane, the founder of the militant Jewish Defense League and an
aggressive advocate of Israeli security, may have been part of a
larger conspiracy against Jewish Americans, New York Newsday said.
   ``It certainly adds to suspicions that this was part of some
greater plot,'' the newspaper quoted an unnamed law enforcement
official as saying. The official added it doesn't necessarily show
that anyone else was involved in the shooting.
   Joe Valliquette, a spokesman for the FBI, confirmed that federal
agents are looking for links between Nosair and any terrorist
groups, but declined to comment on the investigation.
   Newsday said, quoting unnamed law enforcement sources, that
investigators found names of five people scrawled on a bank
calendar in Nosair's home: Ackerman; U.S. District Judges Jack B.
Weinstein and Edward Korman; former assistant U.S. attorney Jacques
Simmelman; and Howard Adelman, a columnist in the pro-Israeli
Jewish Press.
   Investigators said there may have been a sixth name, but it
could not be confirmed.
   Law enforcement officials said Nosair has not explained the
cryptic list, but they warned the people named on in to take
precautions, Newsday said.

   Columbia's seven astronauts
expressed optimism the shuttle's fifth countdown would lead to
liftoff as the clock ticked toward this weekend's launch.
   ``This time, why, I think we have a very good feeling. We're
ready to go,'' Columbia's commander Vance Brand said after arriving
with his crew late Thursday from Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Columbia is scheduled to blast off at 1:28 a.m. EST Sunday. The
countdown proceeded uninterrupted, with only ``nickel and dime
problems ... the type of things we typically have during a launch
countdown,'' NASA test director Al Sofge said today.
   Meteorologists today forecast a 65 percent chance of good
weather at launch time, slightly worse than earlier predictions.
The main concerns are low clouds and possible high winds.
   NASA has been trying since May to send up Columbia with the $150
million Astro observatory, which will be operated by the crew.
   Because of hydrogen leaks, three previous countdowns came to an
abrupt halt hours before liftoff. Numerous repairs were needed
before the shuttle was pronounced safe. Problems with the
observatory also forced a postponement.
   Comet Levy, one of the objects to be observed, is moving rapidly
out of the solar system and not nearly as visible as it would have
been in September, during the last launch attempt.
   ``You've all heard comets are harbingers of bad news and bad
luck. Well, this time we have no comet so we're going to go,'' said
astronaut Jeff Hoffman, one of the crew's four astronomers.
   Among those afraid to get their hopes up are scientists who have
been working on the Astro mission for years.
   ``We're just as excited. The only qualifier is we've learned to
be somewhat skeptical if it will actually happen until we see it
get launched,'' said Arthur Davidsen of Johns Hopkins University,
principal investigator for one of Astro's four telescopes.
   Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope
will focus on some of the hottest objects in the universe.
   The mission originally was scheduled for 1986 but was delayed by
the Challenger accident that year.

   British army reinforcements
arrived in Northern Ireland today to combat an expected Christmas
season terrorist campaign, the army said.
   The army headquarters in Northern Ireland said the extra 600
troops were being deployed to help the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
the province's police force.
   It is the first time in four years that reinforcements have been
sent to the British-run province, the army said.
   ``This is not a reactive measure but part of a prudent
management of security force activity,'' an army spokesman said.
``They will be retained in Northern Ireland as long as it is
absolutely necessary.''
   The constabulary said intelligence reports indicated that both
the outlawed Irish Republican Army, which is mainly Roman Catholic,
and Protestant paramilitary groups planned an increase in attacks
in the coming weeks.
   A spokesman refused to say where the troops will be based, but
sources said they would be spread throughout the province,
increasing patrols and roadblocks.
   Seventy-two people have been killed in terrorist incidents in
1990, 27 of them since October. In 1989, 62 people were killed.
   The reinforcements bring the number of British troops in
Northern Ireland to about 11,000, the Ministry of Defense said.
   Britain sent troops to Northern Ireland when sectarian and
political violence erupted in August 1969. Since then, nearly 2,900
people have died in the violence.

<DATELINE>SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle responded to
calls for caution in the Persian Gulf by saying that too much
patience with Saddam Hussein carries a steep moral price.
   Holding back on the use of military force against Iraq could
lead to greater U.S. casualties and increased suffering for the
people of Kuwait, Quayle said in a speech Thursday at Seton Hall
University.
   ``With every day that passes,'' the plight of the people of
Kuwait ``grows more and more desperate,'' Quayle said. ``Is this a
moral course of action?''
   ``Will continued patience with Iraq help make the world
vulnerable to nuclear blackmail by Saddam Hussein?'' he asked.
``Does patience today risk greater American casualties tomorrow?''
   Quayle's call for a limit to patience countered calls for
caution by two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who on
Wednesday urged Bush to give sanctions at least a year to work.
   And on Thursday, former Navy Secretary James Webb told the
Senate Armed Service Committee that ``the president's mistake in
sending so many troops should not be compounded by a further error
in using them in a premature, unprovoked ground offensive.''
   Quayle argued that a precedent had to be set in the post-Cold
War era that the world community would not tolerate territorial
aggression.
   ``If Saddam Hussein succeeds in his aggression, it is likely
that his success will embolden other dictators to emulate his
example,'' he said. The Persian Gulf crisis ``will set a precedent
- either on behalf of greater world order or on behalf of greater
world chaos.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri
have appealed to Bush to give time for U.N. sanctions against Iraq
to work.
   Quayle countered by throwing down the gauntlet to Congress to
act if members did not approve of the president's policy.
   ``If Congress doesn't like what the president is doing, Congress
has the power to deny funds to the president,'' Quayle said.
   Several dozen protesters greeted the vice president with banners
that read ``Hey Dan, Should I Join The National Guard?'' Quayle
avoided serving in Vietnam by joining the guard in Indiana.
   But Quayle's audience at the Roman Catholic school was largely
sympathetic. It hissed and booed at a student who asked Quayle how
he could push for a war that may involve tens of thousands of
casualties when he avoided combat in the Vietnam War.
   ``There's nothing wrong with serving your country by serving in
the National Guard,'' Quayle said to overwhelming applause.

   The German Red Cross trucked 5,000 food
packages to Moscow today in a growing worldwide effort led by the
Germans to try to stave off winter starvation in the Soviet Union.
   The aid left this morning from the Red Cross's central warehouse
in nearby Meckenheim in a convoy of trucks, trailers and small
buses.
   The president of Germany's Red Cross, Botho zu
Sayn-Wittgenstein, said he expected the food - individual packages
prepared and donated by German citizens - to arrive in the Soviet
capital in about four days.
   It is the first land transport of German-organized food to leave
for the Soviet Union. Another truck convoy organized by the
Catholic relief organization, Caritas, is to leave on Saturday.
   On Thursday, a plane carrying 25,000 pre-packaged meals for
children's hospitals and orphanages arrived in Moscow in the first
shipment by German charities aimed at easing the chaotic food
situation in the Soviet Union.
   Also Thursday, the government decided to give the Soviets
foodstuffs and medical supplies built up against a repeat of the
1948-49 Berlin Blockade, in which Josef Stalin tried to starve the
West's isolated island in Berlin.
   Those reserves include 66,000 tons of rye, 26,000 tons of canned
meat and 7,500 tons of butter. Berlin officials estimate the
supplies could feed 10 million Soviets for a month and value the
reserve at $340 million.
   There is rapidly increasing concern that food shortages this
winter in the Soviet Union could lead to unrest and destabilize the
government of President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made aid to the Soviets a top
item on his international agenda, arguing that without a stable
Soviet Union ongoing reform in eastern Europe could be endangered.
   His concern culminated this week in a two-day meeting between
German experts, led by Kohl's top foreign policy adviser, and
Soviet officials to discuss expected shortages and how to prevent
similar problems in the future.
   Government spokesman Hans Klein acknowledged the food donations
were stopgap measures aimed at getting the Soviets through the
winter.
   But he said the delegation, led by Kohl adviser Horst Telstchik,
``negotiated long-term cooperation'' between the Soviets and
Germans. They discussed how Germany could help improve the Soviet
Union's problem-plagued transport system, food production and
rundown factories.
   Leaders of 15 private charitable organizations, meanwhile, met
in Bonn today to coordinate donations and logistics.
   A government committee was formed in the Soviet Union to help
insure the private aid initiatives would not be hindered by
bureaucracy or transportation problems.
   And in Moscow, the KGB announced today it was forming a special
unit to control distribution and prevent theft of humanitarian aid.
Western diplomats had expressed that concern donated food might be
stolen by black marketeers, siphoned off by corrupt officials, or
simply rot because of inefficient Soviet transportation and storage
facilities.
   The mass-circulation Bild newspaper has started its own campaign
- ``A Heart for Russia'' - encouraging the public to assemble aid
packets or donate $34 dollars minimum to a special Red Cross fund
for Soviet hunger relief.
   The grass-roots campaign took on an official character Wednesday
night, as Kohl went on the national ZDF television network to
appeal for donations.
   Stern magazine, allied with ZDF in the campaign, said Thursday
it was donating $340,000.
   The action is an ironic twist in the history of two former
enemies. More than 20 million Russians died fighting the Germans in
World War II, and West Berliners nearly starved before the Allies'
Berlin Airlift rescued them.
   These days, Germans, led by Kohl, credit the Soviet Union with
clearing the way for reunification, which will culminate Sunday in
the first free and united German elections since 1932.

   Syria has assured Britain it will work
for the release of Western hostages in Lebanon, London's new envoy
to Damascus said today.
   ``The Syrian government gives us assurances that they will work
strenuously for their release, not only for British hostages, but
for all Western hostages,'' said Charge d'Affaires Andrew
Tesorieri, two days after the countries ended a four-year break in
diplomatic relations.
   ``The Syrian government has regarded its efforts as being done
in humanitarian spirit, and we look forward to some results from
our joint efforts,'' Tesorieri said at an embassy ceremony.
   At a news conference on Thursday, Tesorieri said the restoration
of ties could help get the four British hostages released.
   ``With the establishment of relations between Britain and Iran
and between Britain and Syria, we would expect this to provide
momentum to the efforts to secure their release,'' he said.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah is the umbrella group for the hostage
holders in Lebanon. Syria, with 40,000 troops in the country under
a 1976 Arab League peace-keeping mandate, is the major power broker
there.
   Britain severed ties with Syria in 1986 after accusing Damascus
of sponsoring an abortive attempt to blow up an Israeli jet with
375 people aboard. Tesorieri said Britain restored ties after being
assured by Syria that it would not support international terrorism
in the future.
   For the past four years, Australia has handled British interests
in Damascus.
   There are 13 Westerners missing and believed kidnapped by Shiite
Moslem extremists in Lebanon. They include four Britons, six
Americans, two Germans and an Italian.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in March
1985.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Charges Illegal Promotion of Growth Hormone by Dairy Board</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Dairy Board has been illegally
promoting an experimental growth hormone for dairy cows, a critic
of the hormone says in in a lawsuit.
   Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Washington, D.C.-based
Foundation on Economic Trends, said he filed the lawsuit Thursday
after discovering that the dairy board had contracted with a public
relations firm to promote the growth hormone.
   Rifkin has used various legal maneuvers to try to block the use
of bovine growth hormone on the grounds that it is unsafe for
humans.
   The latest action is based on documents he obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act that Rifkin says show the dairy board
was working in collusion with the growth hormone's makers to
promote it.
   He also petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on
Thursday to ``immediately halt any promotion of this product by FDA
officials and to immediately rescind the use of this product in the
marketplace until it is approved.''
   The FDA is considering whether to approve the hormone for
routine use, but it has already allowed milk from experimentally
treated cows to be released for human consumption.
   Yvonne Dock, the dairy board's spokeswoman, said she had no
comment on Rifkin's action or his remarks. William Grigg, an FDA
spokesman, also had no comment, saying the agency had not yet seen
the petition.
   Grigg defended the decision to allow consumption of milk
containing the hormone.
   ``The safety to human beings is clear,'' Grigg said. He said the
hormone has no effect in humans and occurs naturally in milk, ``so
we've always consumed it.''
   Rifkin and other critics have charged that the hormone could
have deleterious effects on human health. Questions have also been
raised about the economic consequences of boosting the milk supply
and thus presumably lowering milk prices.
   Rifkin said the dairy board is prevented by law from promoting
such substances before they are approved by the FDA.
   ``The dairy board cannot put out any information regarding
efficacy or safety of a product before its approval,'' Rifkin said.
``It is a violation of the law. Nor can they collude and be in
meetings with private companies to be in such a campaign.''
   The lawsuit seeks to block the board ``from continuing with
their campaign to promote this product,'' Rifkin said.
   The board was set up by Congress to help increase the
consumption of dairy products produced in the United States, said
Maureen Bergen, the board's director of advertising and promotion
programs.
   The Department of Agriculture oversees and approves its
expenses, she said, but the board is funded by dairy farmers, not
the government.
   The documents obtained in Rifkin's Freedom of Information Act
request include minutes of an April meeting in which the board
agreed to spend $1,085,000 on a public relations firm ``for the
management of the BST issue.'' BST stands for bovine somatotropin,
the technical term for the hormone.
   In a March 12 letter obtained by Rifkin, Ernest Miller, chairman
ofthe board's industry and public relations committee, said that
the law requires that no board funds ``are to be spent to influence
legislation on regulation.''
   ``If NDB (the National Dairy Board) were to become proactive on
BST while it is still under government review, that action could be
construed as lobbying on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies,''
the letter continued.

   President Hosni Mubarak's party today
appeared headed for victory in parliamentary elections boycotted by
major opposition groups. Clashes left at least three people dead
and dozens wounded.
   By mid-afternoon today, unofficial tabulations showed Mubarak's
National Democrats with 70 seats and independents 18. Officials
said runoffs will be held on Thursday to decide 89 seats.
Unoffocial results in the other 277 electoral districts were not
immediately available.
   The preliminary results were distributed by the government's
Middle East News Agency. Official returns were expected later today
or Saturday.
   Officials said many seats needed a runoff because many
candidates entered the faces, meaning no one got a majority of
votes.
   Many Egyptians did not bother to vote because they see the
454-seat People's Assembly as a rubber stamp of the government's
policies. Major opposition parties also boycotted them.
   Winners from the governing party included Cabinet ministers
Youssef Wali of agriculture, Ahmed Fat'hi Sorour of education and
Maher Abaza of electricity and energy. Fayda Kamel, one of four
women among the National Democrats' 444 candidates, also won.
   More than 16 million of Egypt's 55 million people were eligible
to vote, but analysts said the turnout was as low as 30 percent in
some Cairo districts. Some voting districts in the countryside,
however, reported as many as 70 percent of registered voters cast
ballots.
   The elections were marred by a bloody clash between police and
supporters of an independent candidate near the Mediterranean city
of Damietta. A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said at least three people died and more than 41 were wounded.
   The state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram put the casualties at one
dead and 80 wounded. Al-Wafd, newspaper of the opposition New Wafd
party, which boycotted the election, said five died and 51 were
wounded.
   Al-Ahram reported another 19 people wounded in scattered clashes
among followers of rival candidates in several provinces.
   Colorful banners carrying names of candidates fluttered over
Cairo's congested streets, vans with loudspeakers campaigned in
many districts and people milled around polling stations today to
watch or distribute handbills.
   Mubarak's party, which has held sweeping majorities of more than
75 percent in the three parliaments since he became president in
1981, was sure to maintain if not increase its sway in the
parliament.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood, banned since 1954 but
tolerated by the government, and three other parties stayed away
from the contest. They are the right-of-center New Wafd,
left-of-center Socialist Labor and centrist Liberals. In the
disbanded assembly, they comprised the largest opposition ever,
almost 100 seats.
   Mubarak suspended the old parliament after the Supreme
Constitutional Court ruled in May that the chamber was elected in
1987 under an unconstitutional law.
   He decreed a new election law to meet court objections. Under
the old law, voters had to choose between voting for independents
or voting for party lists. The new law allows votes for individual
candidates only.

   After fighting AIDS for years as a public
official, the director of the city's AIDS Activities Co-ordinating
Office has found out he has the disease.
   James Hymes, director of the office since June, said he was
diagnosed Monday. Hymes, 40, has worked in the city Health
Department for 11 years, most of that time as a program analyst.
   Hymes, now out on leave, said he wasn't sure when he'd resume
his job as AIDS director. He said he decided to have a blood test
for the virus in October because of an unusual weight loss - 15
pounds in 30 days.
   Even though he expected the diagnosis, Hymes said, ``when they
tell you you're going to die, it's a little difficult.''
   Hymes said the test results did not surprise him because ``I
just assumed I was positive.'' He told the newspaper 62 of his
friends, several of whom were his sexual partners, had died of
AIDS.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving it defenseless
against disease.
   Barry Savitz, executive deputy health commissioner, said he
expected Hymes to resume working ``when his doctor feels that he's
ready to do so.''
   ``We look forward to his return, just as we look forward to
maintaining the employment of any person with AIDS,'' Savitz said.
   Ennes Littrell, director of a group called Action AIDS, called
Hymes ``incredibly accessible and supportive of our work.''

   In Bangladesh, police fired tear gas and
rubber bullets today to drive off thousands of rock-throwing
protesters demanding President Hussain Muhammad Ershad resign,
according to reports reaching India.
   About 10,000 people defied bans on processions and poured
through the streets of Dhaka to protest the state of emergency
imposed Tuesday night, the unofficial reports said.
   Several people were injured but exact figures were not
available, said witnesses who demanded anonymity because of a
government-imposed news blackout.
   Reports by The Associated Press and other news agencies out of
Dhaka, the capital, are subject to prior censorship. A government
censor today deleted 19 lines from a 32-line AP story from Dhaka.
   Ershad, a former army general who seized power in a bloodless
coup in 1982, ordered the emergency after six weeks of increasing
political turbulence. The unrest was prompted by Ershad's
announcement that a new presidential election would be held in June
1991 and he would run again.
   The country's top opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina of the Awami
League and Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, refuse
to participate in any elections unless Ershad first lets a
caretaker administration take power.
   The around-the-clock curfew, imposed with the state of
emergency, was lifted for seven hours today in Dhaka to enable
people to buy food and attend prayer sessions on the weekly Islamic
holy day.
   Crowds streamed out of the Baitul Mukarram mosque in the center
of Dhaka, shouting demands for Ershad's resignation.
   After a half-mile march, their numbers had swelled to about
10,000. Security forces fired tear gas and many of the marchers
hurled bricks.
   A block from the mosque, police used batons to break up another
anti-Ershad demonstration, the unofficial reports said. Several
thousand women, students, journalists and cultural activists were
dispersed by the baton-swinging police.
   Most people returned home when the curfew was re-imposed at its
scheduled time of 3 p.m. (4 a.m. EST). Government troops and police
patrolled the city, periodically chasing small crowds that gathered
in alleys and narrow lanes.
   Troops fired rubber bullets in some areas, according to
unofficial reports from witnesses.
   The curfew also was relaxed in Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi,
state-run radio said in Dhaka.
   The Bangladeshi government, in a news release late Thursday,
said the situation remained largely peaceful.
   It said, however, that an angry mob tried to attack a power
station, a government office and a official's residence in the
northeastern town of Sylhet Thursday. Police fired five rounds,
wounding one person, the news release said.
   In Chittagong, Bangladesh's second-largest city, 446 doctors,
teachers and staffers at the Chittagong Medical College and
Hospital resigned in protest of the emergency declaration,
according to reports conveyed by intermediaries.
   Ershad said the state of emergency was needed to preserve
``internal security and the national economy.''
   The government's claims that all was peaceful Thursday were
disputed by airline passengers who arrived in neighboring
countries.
   Travelers who reached Bangkok and Calcutta reported hearing
periodic gunfire in Dhaka. They said cars were burned and rocks
thrown by government opponents.
   Opposition leaders claimed Ershad's security forces shot and
killed 50 people and wounded more than 1,000 in a half-dozen cities
Wednesday.
   The opposition claims, which have sometimes been exaggerated in
the past, could not be verified. Diplomatic sources in New Delhi
said they had reports that four people were killed and 15 wounded
Wednesday.
   The government has not issued any casualty reports since the
state of emergency was imposed. Curfew has been in place in the
four biggest cities: Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi.
   With a per capital annual income of $160, Bangladesh's 110
million inhabitants are among the poorest in the world.
   Ershad's eight years in power have brought a measure of
stability to this 19-year-old nation born of a war of secession
from Pakistan, but his opponents accuse him of staying in power by
rigging the 1986 presidential election.

   The KGB announced today it was forming a special
unit to control distribution and prevent theft of humanitarian aid
from the West.
   The first planeload of donated food reached the capital Thursday
evening and was promptly distributed to children's hospitals,
orphanages and homes for the retarded.
   They began receiving the pre-packaged meals and chocolate today.
   The first shipment came from German charities. Humanitarian
organizations in the United States, Italy and the Nordic countries
were also preparing to send milk, flour, canned goods and other
staples.
   Western diplomats expressed concern that donated food might be
stolen by black marketeers, siphoned off by corrupt officials or
simply rot because of inefficient Soviet transportation and storage
facilities.
   Worried that even a single incident of theft could produce bad
publicity and slow the Western aid, the Supreme Soviet legislature
voted Nov. 23 to put the KGB in charge of making sure the food goes
where it's supposed to.
   Tass reported today that the security police had set up a new
headquarters to ``coordinate measures in the battle against
economic sabotage'' and ensure ``the proper use of imported
products and humanitarian aid provided by foreign countries.''
   The official news agency said KGB officials ``view the
fulfillment of the Supreme Soviet's order as one of its most
important tasks, dictated by the difficult political situation and
economic crisis in the country.''
   Food shortages have worsened greatly this fall, leading to
rationing of meat, butter, sugar and other necessities in Leningrad
and dozens of other cities across Russia and the Ukraine.
   In Moscow, sugar and cigarettes are rationed, and the list of
goods that are hard to find in state stores grows every week. It
now includes milk, eggs, sausage, cheese and matches.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak has warned that without Western
aid, major cities could face hunger and popular unrest over the
winter.
   Many Soviets now openly blame President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
perestroika reforms for their discomfort.
   Reasons for the chaotic food situation vary.
   As the Soviet Union begins the transition to a market economy,
many farmers have stopped selling their crops through state stores
at low official prices. Instead, they are taking their products to
private farmers' markets, where prices are often 10 times as high.
   In addition, some of the restive Soviet republics, including
Georgia, Byelorussia and Lithuania, have cut off shipments of food
products outside their borders.
   Also, black marketeering appears to be on the rise, and many
Soviets allege that Communist Party bureaucrats are intentionally
creating economic problems to try to stop Gorbachev's reforms and
hold onto their privileged positions.
   Gorbachev said on Thursday that he and other Communists were
``guilty before the working class'' because they have failed to
address the concerns of ordinary people.

   The Zambian Parliament passed a bill today
allowing the formation of political parties for the first time in
17 years.
   The 125 lawmakers, more than two-thirds of whom were appointed
by President Kenneth Kaunda, passed the bill unanimously after four
days of heated debate.
   The bill, to be presented to Kaunda for final approval on
Tuesday, clears the way for multiparty general parliamentary and
presidential elections in one of Africa's poorest nations.
   But opposition supporters are still arguing over a remaining
clause in the constitution that bans other parties from contesting
by-elections before national polls open next year.
   ``The clause may end up as a mockery of the entire
democratization of the system we are talking about,'' said the
former general-secretary for the ruling party, Humprey Mulemba.
Mulemba is a staunch supporter of the pro-democracy opposition
group, the Movement For Multiparty Democracy.
   The group was legalized in July following violent food riots and
anti-government protests that left at least 27 people dead.
   Labor leaders have been at the forefront of the group's campaign
to end nearly two decades of single party rule in this southern
African nation of 7.5 million people.
   In September, the ruling United National Independence Party
bowed to political pressure and said it will reintroduce a
Western-style democracy.
   Kaunda, who led this former British colony to independence in
1964, imposed one-party rule in 1973.
   Zambia is the latest African nation to officially reintroduce
pluralism.
   On Thursday, the former Marxist Mozambican government permitted
multiple political parties for the first time since the southern
African nation gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

   Rebel forces have captured the largest town in
eastern Chad, meeting no resistance from a 500-strong French
contingent based there, the French Foreign Ministry said today.
   The troops of rebel leader Idriss Deby marched in and took over
Abeche, where 500 French soldiers are based, on Thursday. Chad
government forces had reportedly retreated westward, leaving Abeche
an open target.
   ``To our knowledge, the rebel forces are in Abeche,'' said a
Foreign Ministry spokesman. ``There was no action against the
French soldiers.''
   The spokesman said the French did not oppose the rebel takeover.
``The mission of French forces is not to intervene in
confrontations between Chadians,'' he said. Chad is a former French
colony.
   The government of President Hissene Habre, meeting this morning
in a special session, said it was determined to ``definitively
destroy the mercenary hordes'' and predicted ``total victory.''
   It made no mention of a rebel takeover at Abeche, a town of
25,000 to 30,000 inhabitants.
   Chad contends that the rebels, based in neighboring Sudan, are
backed by Libya. But France says the fighting is among Chadians.
Libya denies involvement in the fighting.
   The ministry spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
reiterated that ``to our knowledge, there are no non-Chadian
elements'' among the rebels.
   On Thursday, France announced it was sending 150 Foreign Legion
parachutists to bolster its 1,000 soldiers in Chad as part of
Operation Sparrowhawk, a ``defensive and dissuasive'' force first
sent in 1986.
   The other 500 troops are based in N'Djamena, the capital.
   France said the Legionnaire's mission was to improve protection
of French troops and nationals in Chad.
   The rebels moved into Abeche as government troops, failing to
mount an effective counteroffensive, retreated to Oum Hadjer, 60
miles west on the road to N'Djamena, according to news reports in
France.
   France said on Thursday that the situation was worsening since
the start of the rebel offensive Nov. 10. Defense Minister
Jean-Pierre Chevenement said that France was ``at this moment''
examining requests by the government of President Habre for more
arms.
   ``It's clear the Chadian army could have substantial needs,''
Chevenement said without elaborating.
   Rebel leader Deby, who received his military training in France,
helped bring Habre to power in 1982 and acted as his military
adviser. But he fled in April 1989 amid allegations of a coup plot.
   Chad contends the rebel offensive is a new effort by Libya to
take over the country, Libya's southern neighbor.
   Libya, backing former rebel leader Goukouni Oueddei, occupied
northern Chad in 1986, but was chased out in a series of lightning
victories. The two countries signed a peace treaty in 1989, but
continue to dispute a Libyan-occupied strip of land on Chad's
northern border.

   The first black Republican o win a House seat
in two generations comes to Washington with an agenda closer to
that of Georgia Rep. Newt Gingrich than his 24 black colleagues
across the aisle.
   Gary Franks, a city alderman from Waterbury, Conn., opposes tax
increases, supports the death penalty and says he won't vote for
any civil rights bill that contains even a hint of racial quotas.
His Nov. 6 election victory over liberal Democrat Toby Moffett in
Connecticut's 5th Congressional District makes Franks the
highest-ranking black elected Republican in the country.
   Franks, who is touring Capitol Hill this week for a series of
orientation meetings, says he's ready to join the 24 Democrats in
the Congressional Black Caucus.
   ``I qualify. I'm black and I'm a congressman,'' said Franks, a
37-year-old real estate developer. ``I'm a fiscal conservative
Republican and I think that in itself will offer a difference
between me and the some 25 members of the caucus.''
   He will be the caucus' only opponent of this year's civil rights
bill and the lone advocate for a brand of conservatism aggressively
opposed by many other caucus members.
   ``He will be one voice that will essentially be, in terms of
voting, ineffectual,'' said David Bositis, a senior research
associate at the Joint Center for Political Studies, a Washington
think tank that focuses on black political issues.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
says Franks won't attract support by waving the conservative
Republican banner.
   ``We hope that he is not used by the right wing to sing the
praises of their position,'' said Edward Hailes, a lawyer in the
NAACP's Washington office.
   But the Republican National Committee does plan to enlist the
freshman lawmaker as a magnet for black voters.
   ``He'll be a national spokesman for the party,'' said Charles
Black, the RNC's chief spokesman. ``He'll be a great example for us
to recruit other blacks to run for office and to draw black voters
into the Republican Party.''
   Franks says his first loyalty will be to his district.
Nevertheless, he says, ``I would like to do all that I can to help
my national party and I will do so if time allows.''
   There has been no black Republican in the House since Illinois
Rep. Oscar de Priest stepped down after three terms in 1935. The
last black in the Senate was Republican Edward Brooke of
Massachusetts, who was defeated in 1978.
   Brooke represented the then-healthy liberal wing of the
Republican Party.
   But Franks describes himself as ``a real conservative and a real
Republican.''
   Observers say that could be a problem when it comes to
recruiting blacks to the GOP fold.
   ``In terms of his policy positions, they are completely
repudiated by the black community,'' Bositis said. ``The idea that
a candidate who was sent to Congress by white voters would be
embraced around the country by black voters is ridiculous.''
   The black caucus has been quiet on the subject of Franks since
his election. Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the senior black
member of Congress, said Franks' Republican status won't prevent
him from participating.

   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha
today met with President Daniel arap Moi in the first publicly
acknowledged, high-level contact between the two countries in 27
years.
   The two talked for about 30 minutes at Moi's official Nairobi
residence and Botha conveyed a message to the Kenyan leader from
President F.W. De Klerk, according to Lee Njiru, Moi's press
officer.
   Njiru said he did not know the contents of the message and
declined to say whether Botha had other plans while in the East
African nation.
   South Africa's Foreign Ministry said the men discussed matters
of ``mutual interest,'' which apparently included plans to
establish air links between Kenya and South Africa, which Moi
scuttled last month, according to the South African Press
Association.
   The news agency said a South African Airways flight was ready to
leave Jan Smuts International Airport in Johannesburg for Nairobi
on Saturday if the talks went well.
   An airlines spokesman, Leon Els, said an Airbus was ready to go
should permission be obtained, according to the South African Press
Association.
   Moi suspended negotiations last month following sharp criticism
of the plan by African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, and
said flights between Kenya and South Africa would resume only after
the apartheid system of racial segregation was dismantled.
   The ANC is one of the major South African groups negotiating
with de Klerk for total abolition of apartheid and a new political
order.
   A Western diplomat in Nairobi described Botha's visit to Kenya
as an early pitch for trade with South Africa, the most
industrialized nation in the continent.
   ``Kenya is trying to jump the queue and get trade agreements
nailed down before apartheid is lifted and the others crowd in.
This is about dollars not politics,'' said the envoy, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Kenya, like most other African nations, officially has no ties
of any kind with South Africa because of that nation's apartheid
policy.
   But there have been unconfirmed reports that Kenya continued
trading with South Africa through third parties in black-ruled
states in southern Africa.
   Kenya also has continued to provide transit facilities to about
half a dozen airlines flying the lucrative London-Johannesburg
route.

   The state Supreme Court today upheld a
state law that allows young school dropouts to be denied or
stripped of their driver's license.
   The court split 3-2 in upholding the nation's first law aimed at
denying licenses to 16- and 17-year-old dropouts who fail to
complete school.
   CHIef Justice Richard Neely said the affected student must be
offered a hearing before the superintendent of schools or an
authorized official before the student quits so he can be notified
of the consequences.
   The law was passed by the LEgislature in 1988 to allow
revocation or denial of a license to a student who drops out before
completing high school.
   Christopher Butch, attorney for dropout Michael Means of
Charleston, said the court test was a first in the nation. ``The
whole world is watching you today,'' Butch had argued when the case
was presented.
   Means lost his license when he quit school in 1988. He turned 16
on March 26, 1988, and dropped out of school the next month but
lost his license even though the law was not enacted until that
June.
   Assistant Attorney General Bruce Walker said the law is an
incentive to keep students in school.
   ``I think holding a bazooka at a child's head would work just as
well,'' Butch said during earlier court testimony.
   The court said the Means case is moot since the teen-ager is now
18 and can get a license, but it ruled on the matter anyway.
   ``A child who has an opportunity to go to school and
deliberately chooses not to avail himself or herself of such
opportunity, demonstrates a general lack of responsibility,'' Neely
wrote.
   Neely said the law provides that when the withdrawal of a
student from school is by mutual consent of school authorities and
the child, a waiver of the license revocation may be granted.
   Justices Thomas B. Miller and Thomas E. McHugh dissented.

   The Marine Corps said today it is ordering
2,996 reservists to report for active duty next weekend in support
of Operation Desert Shield.
   The Navy announced a call-up of 437 reservists, mostly for
medical and intelligence support.
   The Marines said 2,274 reservists were ordered to report Dec. 9
For duty at Camp COurtney in OKinawa, Japan, the home station of
the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force. It did not say why they were
needed there, but the call-up could mean parts of the 3rd Marines
will be sent to the Persian Gulf area.
   The Marines also announced that 722 reservists were ordered to
report for active duty Dec. 8. About 300 of those will go to Camp
Pendleton, Calif., with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, and the
rest will be assigned to 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp
Lejeune, N.C., ``for processing and to await further orders.''
   Complete lists of the units being called were not immediately
available.

<HEAD>Regulator Says DeConcini Crossed Bounds of Propriety</HEAD>

   A federal regulator told the Senate Ethics
Committee today that he believed Arizona Sen. Dennis DEConcini
crossed the bounds of propriety in trying to help savings and loan
owner Charles Keating Jr.
   The regulator, Michael Patriarca, said the other four ``Keating
Five'' senators under investigation may not have crossed that line.
   Patriarca, a San Francisco-based thrift regulator, made that
assessment in summarizing a meeting he and three other regulators
held with the five senators on April 9, 1987, when the senators
were trying to help Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   ``It's only where the senators attempted to influence, to change
the outcome of the examination (of Lincoln), of the regulatory
treatment for this specific institution, that impropriety was
breached,'' Patriarca said.
   ``My personal view is SENator DeConcini did that,'' he said.
``It's not clear to me that any of the others did.''
   He was responding to questions from the committee's ranking
Republican, Sen. Warren RUdman, R-N.H. A day earlier, Patriarca
said the regulators faced ``a full court press'' on behalf of
Lincoln by the senators.
   Patriarca also testified that his former boss, Edwin J. Gray,
was upset after a meeting he held privately a week before with four
of the senators.
   He said GRay told him that one, Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.,
had offered him a deal on behalf of Lincoln - that the thrift would
make more home loans if the regulators would back off a regulation
limiting Lincoln's ability to make speculative equity investments.
   ``HE was agitated,'' Patriarca said of Gray, who then was head
of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   ``He was stressed or distressed, and he told me that he was
shocked by the meeting,'' he said.
   Patriarca testified for a second day before the Ethics
Committee's hearing into alegations the five senators improperly
intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating, a major financial
contributor.
   Patriarca also told Rudman that his own efforts to bend over
backwards to be fair to Keating's thrift ultimately resulted in a
delay of several months in completion of the regulators' critical
examination of Lincoln.
   Under cross-examination by William Taylor, lawyer for Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., Patriarca said Cranston wasn't present in their
meeting when the other senators mounted what he had described as
``a full court press'' on behalf of Keating.
   On Thursday, Patriarca depicted DeConcini as the leader of the
senators' efforts.
   ``It was my impression, quite frankly, that Senator DeConcini
was negotiating on behalf of Lincoln ... attempting to get us, the
regulators, to change our position on the examination,'' Patriarca
said.
   The five senators are accused of intervening improperly in the
regulatory process on behalf of Keating and Lincoln after the
lawmakers and their favored causes received $1.3 million in
political contributions from the financier. Lincoln's $2 billion
collapse has become emblematic of the disaster that engulfed the
savings and loan industry.
   Besides DeConcini and Cranston, the senators under scrutiny are
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats John Glenn of Ohio
and Donald Riegle of Michigan.
   Patriarca, now western regional director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, went beyond the allegations leveled in four days of
testimony by his onetime boss.
   Gray, the five senators' chief accuser, said he felt improperly
pressured by four of the senators in a disputed April 2, 1987,
meeting. In the session, Gray referred the lawmakers to his West
Coast staff.
   Patriarca described the meeting between the senators and San
Francisco regulators, which took place on April 9.
   ``The tone that the meeting took was that the senators seemed to
have made up their minds ... that we were in fact harassing
Lincoln, that we were incorrect, wrong, and that basically we got
the full-court press,'' he said.
   But Patriarca said the senators became less aggressive after he
revealed that examiners intended to seek a Justice DEpartment
criminal investigation of some of Lincoln's practices.
   Patriarca said the regulators found ``absolutely reckless''
practices at Lincoln, with no credit documentation for 52 loans
they examined. He said the thrift was engaged in highly risky
practices. He said there was evidence the files had been stuffed
with phony underwriting documents.
   He said Cranston left soon after the April 9 meeting began,
saying he shared the concerns of the other lawmakers but had duties
on the Senate floor.
   Cranston accounted for $889,000 of the $1.3 million contributed
by Keating and his associates. Much of the money was given to voter
registration projects supported by the CAlifornia senator.
   Cranston said in testimony released Thursday that his
involvement with Keating was ``politically stupid.'' The testimony
came last April in a closed session with the committee.
   ``I see nothing ethically, morally or legally wrong with the
amounts that were involved,'' Cranston testified. ``I will grant
that it turned out to be politically stupid and unwise, because
it's caused an uproar that I regret. But being politically stupid
or unwise is quite different from being ethically improper.''
   Patriarca told the committee that Glenn was ``blunt'' and
``seemed to have also made up his mind that our behavior was
somehow wrong.'' He said McCain seemed ``uncomfortable being at the
meeting.''
   Riegle, he said, conducted ``a cross-examination to really probe
the basis for the findings that we were saying we'd reached.''

   PRo golfer Tom Watson severed ties with
the country club where he learned to play after an application by
the co-founder of H&amp;R Block was reportedly thwarted because he is
Jewish.
   Watson on Thursday said he resigned from the Kansas City Country
Club because Henry Bloch, chairman of the nation's largest tax
preparation service, had his application withdrawn.
   ``They put a prominent JEwish person up for membership and his
application was withdrawn,'' Watson said. ``It's something I can't
personally live with because my family is Jewish.''
   Watson is not Jewish, but his wife, Linda, is. They have two
children.
   The five-time winner of the British Open and two-time winner of
the U.S. Open became a junior member of the club when he was 21 and
has been a full member for six years.
   ``I would hope the club would significantly change so some good
people of any religion, race and sex could be members,'' said
Watson. ``That's the way I feel about it.''
   Bloch, chairman and co-founder of H&amp;R Block Inc., had been
proposed as a member by Donald Hall, chairman of Hallmark Cards
Inc. Hall withdrew Bloch's application when the membership
committee failed to act on it.
   Bloch said today that he had no comment, and Hallmark spokesman
Charles Hucker said Hall was out of the country and could not be
reached.
   L. Chandler Smith, president of the 94-year-old club, said it
had no blacks among its 400 foundation members. Asked if the club
has any Jewish members, Smith said, ``To the best of my knowledge,
no.''
   He declined to explain the club's membership requirements.
   ``I don't think its proper that I go ahead into the detail of
that process,'' he said. ``I just don't think it should be public
information.''
   But he said the club does not discriminate and Bloch's religion
would not have been a factor.
   Watson said he still believes in the right of private clubs to
determine their membership, ``but when they choose to discriminate
against your beliefs, you don't have to choose to be a member
there.''
   Howard Levitan, president of Kehilath Israel Synagogue in KAnsas
City, commended Watston's action.
   Watson mailed in his letter of resignation Wednesday, but had
informed the club's president of his intentions to resign three
weeks ago after BLoch's application was withdrawn.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev postponed today's
scheduled visit to the southern republic of MOldavia, his first
domestic trip in three months, because of tensions in the republic,
Tass reported.
   The Moldavian parliament issued a statement after the
cancellation was announced, linking the postponement to ``actions
by separatists,'' Tass said.
   The official news agency said a new date for a presidential
visit to the strife-torn republic will be announced later.
   Gorbachev, who faces growing economic problems, food shortages,
ethnic unrest and independence drives by most of the 15 Soviet
republics, also announced this week he wanted to postpone a
December trip to Oslo to pick up his Nobel Peace Prize. He cited
his domestic woes.
   The Nobel committee said the award ceremonies would be held as
scheduled Dec. 9-11, but that Gorbachev could deliver the prize
winner's traditional speech in May.
   Tass said Gorbachev had been scheduled to speak to the Moldavian
parliament today about the social and political situation in the
Soviet Union. It said he was also to have met with intellectuals in
the republic's capital, Kishinev.
   Interfax, an independent news agency, said Moldavian President
Mircha Snegur told legislators separatist-minded deputies from the
Dniester region in the east refused to attend the session,
prompting Gorbachev to cancel.
   Ethnic tensions turned violent in Moldavia last month when
troops clashed with activists in the Dniester region, leaving four
dead.
   Gorbachev's last domestic trip was Aug. 17 when he traveled from
his summer home in the Crimean peninsula to speak to soldiers in
the Black Sea port of Odessa. In his speech he accused Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein of treachery and said the Soviet Union had a special
responsibility to resolve the Gulf crisis because it had been
Iraq's main weapons supplier.
   Since then, Gorbachev has made several trips to Western Europe,
most recently to Paris for the COnference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Some Soviet politicians have accused him of
not paying enough attention to domestic issues.

<TEXT>
   The United States should continue ``our
present defensive position'' in Saudi Arabia rather than wage war
with Iraq, a former top-ranking intelligence official told COngress
today.
   Retired Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, who headed the National
Security Agency during the Reagan administration, said he had ``no
doubt that we could win'' an offensive action against Saddam
Hussein's forces.
   But Odom said attacking Iraqi forces in Kuwait - or Iraq itself
 could mean an even longer U.S. military presence in the region
than envisioned with the defensive posture now established.
   Odom's testimony came at the end of a week in which members of
the Senate Armed Services Committee heard an array of witnesses,
including two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urge
caution on the Bush administration as it seeks to end Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait.
   ``Every single witness we've had here with differing views on
other things, all of them have felt we've over-deployed,''
committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-GA., said at the conclusion of
Thursday's testimony.
   The Bush administration could have led off the hearings, perhaps
setting the tone. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were invited to be
the initial witnesses.
   But they declined and the spotlight has been captured by a
series of witnesses who underscored doubts among Democratic
senators. CHeney and Powell are slated to testify next week. And
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said this morning that he
also would testify.
   Odom stressed in his testimony today that he supports Bush's
buildup in the Persian Gulf, but said he was bewildered by the
administration's apparent impatience with the results to date.
   ``I am puzzled by the administration's failure to take the
credit for its success on this slow route to its objectives,'' said
Odom, joining others in urging more time for economic sanctions to
work.
   ``Some of the administration's rhetoric makes it sound as though
we are losing. That is clearly not true,'' said ODom, now a
National security expert at the Hudson Institute, a conservative
think tank.
   ``The weight in favor of ... holding our present defensive
position in Saudi Arabia seems to be quite large,'' he said.
   The hearings are proceeding amid published reports that the
United States is sending another 300 war planes to the Persian
Gulf, increasing the size of America's air fighting force in the
region by a third.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting unidentified Washington sources,
reported in today's editions that the additional aircraft will
include a second squadron of F-117 Stealth fighters and additional
F-15E ground-attack jets, F-16 fighters, A-16 tank-killers,
refueling tankers and RF-4C photo-reconnaissance jets.
   The Times said the reinforcements will come from 27 Air Force
units with about 10,000 personnel. The newspaper said the extra
units will be dispatched from Europe and U.S.-based Air National
Guard and reserve squadrons.
   The deployment, which will begin as early as this week, will
boost the number of U.S. AIr Force planes in the gulf to 1,200, the
Times said.
   Bush's announcement earlier this month that he was sending
200,000 troops to the gulf region in addition to the 230,000
dispatched since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait drew fire from
several Democrats. Among them was Nunn who had earlier supported
the president's gulf policy.
  To blunt the attack, Republicans urged a special session of
Congress, an issue on the agenda today for a meeting between Bush
and congressional leaders.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill., had lunch with Bush on Thursday. Foley said
afterward, ``I hope the president doesn't call back the 101st
Congress. ... Reports of that may be premature.''
   The White House was noncommittal about increasing demands for a
special session from lawmakers who had adjourned before the latest
deployment. ``Let's wait and see,'' presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   He agreed with a questioner who characterized the White House
position as ``reluctant.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Armed
Services Committee, said he hoped ``we give the president not a
blank check but give the president a sense of support that we have
confidence in him to make certain decisions.''
   But Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., senior Republican on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that ``airing all of our
differences at this time in an official session of Congress would
give heart to Saddam Hussein and doubts to our allies.''

   Here is the text of President Bush's statement
and news conference today on the Persian Gulf crisis:
   I have a statement, an opening statement, that is a little
longer than normal and I'd ask your indulgence, and then I will be
glad to respond to questions.
   We're in the Gulf because the world must not and cannot reward
aggression. And we're there because our vital interests are at
stake. And we're in the Gulf because of the brutality of Saddam
Hussein.
   We're dealing with a dangerous dictator all too willing to use
force, who has weapons of mass destruction and is seeking new ones,
and who desires to control one of the world's key resources -- all
at a time in history when the rules of the post-Cold War world are
being written.
   Our objectives remain what they were since the outset. We seek
Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. We seek
the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government. We seek the
release of all hostages and the free functioning of all embassies.
And we seek the stability and security of this critical region of
the world.
   We are not alone in these goals and objectives. THe United
Nations, invigorated with a new sense of purpose, is in full
agreement. The United Nations Security Council has endorsed 12
resolutions to condemn Iraq's unprovoked invasion and occupation of
Kuwait, implement tough economic sanctions to stop all trade in and
out of Iraq, and authorize the use of force to compel Saddam to
comply.
   Saddam Hussein has tried every way he knows how to make this a
fight between Iraq and the United States and, clearly, he has
failed. Forces of 26 other nations are standing
shoulder-to-shoulder with our troops in the Gulf. The fact is that
it is not the United States against Iraq, it is Iraq against
   the world, and there's never been a clearer demonstration of a
world united against appeasement and aggression.
   Yesterday's United Nations Security Council resolution was
historic. Once again, the Security Council has enhanced the
legitimate peacekeeping function of the United Nations. Until
yesterday, Saddam may not have understood what he's up against in
terms of world opinion, and I am hopeful that now he will realize
that he must leave Kuwait immediately.
   I'm continually asked how effective are the UN sanctions --those
put into effect on August 6th -- and I don't know the answer to
that question. Clearly, the sanctions are having some effect but I
Can't tell you that the sanctions alone will get the job done.
   And thus I welcome yesterday's United Nations action. The
fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe are being severely damaged
by the economic effects of Saddam's actions. The developing
countries of Africa and in our hemisphere are being victimized by
this dictator's rape of his neighbor, Kuwait. Those who feel that
there is no down side to waiting months and months must consider
the devastating damage being done every day to the fragile
economies of those countries that can afford it the least.
   And, as Chairman Alan Greenspan testified just the other day,
the increase in oil prices resulting directly from Saddam's
Invasion is hurting our country, too. And our economy, as I said
the other day, is at best in a serious slowdown. And if uncertainty
remains in the energy markets, the slowdown will ge worse.
   I've spelled out once again our reasons for sending troops to
the Gulf. Let me tell you the things that concern me most.
   First, I put the immorality of the invasion of Kuwait itself. No
nation should rape, pillage and brutalize its neighbor. No nation
should be able to wipe a member state of the United Nations and the
Arab League off the face of the earth. And I'm deeply concerned
about all the hostages, innocent people held against their will in
direct contravention of international law.
   And then there's this cynical and brutal policy, forcing people
to beg for their release, parceling out human lives to families and
traveling emissaries like so much chattel.
   I'm deeply concerned about our own embassy in Kuwait. The flag
Is still flying there; a handful of beleaguered Americans remain
inside the embassy, unable to come and go. This treatment of our
embassy violates every civilized principle of diplomacy. And it
demeans our people, it demeans our country. And I am determined
that this embassy, as called for under Security Council Resolution
674, be fully replenished and our people free to come home.

   A scientist's forecasts of possible earthquakes as
earlyas this weekend have gone largely unnoticed in this
quake-prone capital, a striking contrast to the fear created in
parts of the United States.
   New Mexico climatologist Iben Browning created a furor across
the Midwest when he said last summer that there was a 50 percent
chance of a strong quake on the NEw Madrid Fault within 48 hours on
either side of Dec. 3.
   The fault runs from Cairo, Ill., to Marked Tree, Ark., about 35
miles east of Memphis.
   Browning's daughter, Evelyn Browning Garriss, has said that
actually the scientist thinks a quake is more likely outside the
United States - especially in Japan. Ms. Browning says he based his
predictions on his observations of powerful high tides caused by
the alignment of the Earth, moon and sun. He says such forces can
trigger earthquakes.
Tokyo, and there has been no outward sign of concern in Japan
during the past week.
   The yen fell sharply against the dollar today, but dealers
attributed the decline to market players seeking a safe investment
after the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution to permit the
use of force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Kaneo Ogino, a dealer at Goldman Sachs (Japan), said of the
earthquake rumors: ``People overseas are overreacting. I don't know
Why stupid people are talking about an earthquake. We're ignoring
this bloody nuisance.''
   Window-rattling earthquakes are common in Japan, and the country
Is obsessed with being properly prepared for the next great
temblor. Buildings and infrastructure are all designed with
earthquakes in mind.
   The most destructive shock in modern history was the ``Great
Kanto Earthquake'' of Sept. 1, 1923, that destroyed a third of
Tokyo and most of neighboring Yokohama, killing 140,000 people.
Many perished in fires that raged through the largely wooden
cities.
   The intensity of that quake is estimated at 7.9 on the Richter
scale.
   The strongest recent Japan quake was on March 6, 1984, also
registering 7.9 on the Richter scale. It caused only one death and
neglibile damage because the epicenter was located deep below the
pacific ocean seabed and well offshore.

   Farmers, homeowners and others recovering
from some of the worst flooding in state history learned that
Washington's rivers can be channeled only so much before they
overflow and reclaim developed land.
   The federal government Thursday set aside $100 million in
disaster relief for roads and bridges damaged during last weekend's
flooding, which forced thousands from their homes, killed hundreds
of livestock and left two men dead, including a man whose body was
not found until Thursday.
   In earlier days, the Snoqualmie, Skykomish, Snohomish,
Stillaguamish, Skagit, NOoksack and Cedar rivers of northwestern
Washington splintered into rivulets and channels on the plains
below the Cascade Mountains during heavy rain.
   But farmers, and later manufacturers and homeowners, forced them
and other rivers into fewer channels by erecting dikes and levees,
said Robert J. Naiman, director of the Center for Streamside
Studies at the University of Washington.
   ``That works until you get a major flow like last week, and then
rivers just go where they've always gone,'' NAiman said Thursday.
   The Red Cross said Thursday the floods destroyed at least 161
homes, mobile homes and apartment units and damaged more than 2,400
others in 13 counties. Figures for three other counties weren't
available.
   The consequences of the flooding were made worse because so many
people had built homes in areas downstream that flood maybe once
every 50 to 100 years, said Bob Beschta, a hydrology professor at
Oregon State University.
an area hasn't flooded (since) anybody can remember, it's probably
OK,'' he said.
   Although some blamed forest clear-cutting in the mountains,
Naiman and Beschta said the lack of trees was not a major factor.
   Trees reduce flooding by catching rain, some of which evaporates
and some of which is taken in for growth. But Beschta said trees
would not be much help at this time of year.
   ``It's dark, it's humid'' and the forest's capacity to hold
water is small, he said.
   MAnmade surfaces such as logging roads and parking lots also
contributed to the flooding. But the greatest damage occurred along

   WASHINGTON: come home.
   What kind of precedent will these actions set for the future if
Saddam's violation of international law goes unchallenged? I'm also
deeply concerned about the future of Kuwait itself.
   The tales of rape and assassination, of coldblooded murder and
rampant looting, are almost beyond belief. The whole civilized
world must unite and say this kind of treatment of people must end
and those who violated the Kuwaiti people must be brought to
justice.
   I'm deeply concerned about Saddam's efforts to acquire nuclear
weapons. Imagine his ability to blackmail his neighbors, should he
possess a nuclear device. We've seen him use chemical weapons on
his own people. We've seen him take his own country, one that
should be wealthy and prosperous, and turn it into a poor country,
all because of insatiable appetite for military equipment and
conquest.
   I've been asked why I ordered more troops to the Gulf. I remain
hopeful that we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis. But
if force is required, we, and the other 26 countries who have
troops in the area, will have enough power to get the job done.
   In our country, I know that there are fears about another
Vietnam. Let me assure you, should military action be required,
this will not be another Vietnam. This will not be a protracted
drawn-out war. The forces arrayed are different; the opposition is
different; the resupply of Saddam's military would be very
different; the countries united against him in the United Nations
are different, the topography of Kuwait is different, and the
motivation of our all-volunteer force is superb.
   I want peace. I want peace, not war, but if there must be war,
we will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their
backs, and I pledge to you there will not be any murky ending. If
one American soldier has to go into battle, that soldier will have
enough force behind him to win and then get out as soon as
possible, as soon as the UN objectives have been achieved. I will
never, ever agree to a halfway effort.
   Let me repeat. We have no argument with the people of Iraq.
Indeed, we have only friendship for the people there. And, further,
I repeat that we have no desire to keep one single American soldier
in the Gulf a single day longer than is necessary to achieve the
objectives set out above.
   NO one wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis more than
I do, and, at the same time, no one is more determined than I am to
see Saddam's aggression reversed.
   And lastly, people now caution patience. The United States and
the entire world have been patient. I will continue to be patient,
but yesterday's UNproperly says to Saddam Hussein, ``Time is running out.
You must
leave Kuwait, and we've given you time to do just exactly that.''
   Many people have talked directly to Saddam Hussein and to his
Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. All have been frustrated by Iraq's
ironclad insistence that it will not leave Kuwait.
   However, to go the extra mile for peace, I will issue an
invitation to Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to come to Washington at
a mutually convenient time during the latter part of the week of
December 10th to meet with me. And I'll invite ambassadors of
several of our coalition partners in the GUlf to join me at that
meeting.
   In addition, I am asking Secretary Jim Baker to go to Baghdad to
see Saddam Hussein, and I will suggest to Iraq's President that he
receive the Secretary of State at a mutually convenient time
between December 15th and January 15th of next year.
   Within the mandate -- within the mandate of the United NAtions
resolutions, I will be prepared, and so will Secretary Baker, to
discuss all aspects of the Gulf crisis. However, to be very clear
about these efforts to exhaust all means for achieving a political
And diplomatic solution, I am not suggesting discussions that will
result in anything less than Iraq's complete withdrawal from
Kuwait, restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government, and freedom
for all hostages.
   Thank you very much, and I will be glad to respond to a few
questions.

   The Illinois Supreme Coanner in which local school councils are
elected violated the constitutional principle of ``one person, one
vote'' by giving parents more power than other voters.
   One of the seven high court justices dissented.
   The ruling came in a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court
in April 1989 by principals, subdistrict superintendents and others
upset with the Chicago School Reform Act.
   THe landmark legislation was intended to decentralize the school
system's top-heavy bureaucracy and give parents more control over
their children's schools, including a majority on the councils that
hire and fire principals.
   The state Supreme Court said, however, that it was
unconstitutional to give more voting power to parents than to other
citizens.
   The Chicago school system, the nation's third-largest, has 604
schools and more than 400,000 students.
   Joan Slay, acting director of Designs for Change, which helped
shape the reform package, said she is certain that the act can be
revised to meet the court's objections.
   ``We can resolve that, we will resolve it,'' said Ms. Slay. ``I
don't consider it a blow. What I think it does mean is that we have
to go back and craft this carefully.''
   Principals, however, praised the ruling. School reform ``seemed
to lay the blame for problems in Chicago schools on the shoulders
of the principals,'' said Bruce Berndt, president of the Chicago
Principals Association. ``Politicizing the principal's position is
not going to make kids learn better.''
   Under the law, the 11-member local school councils include six
members who must be parents of enrolled students and are elected
solely by fellow parents. The councils do not set tax rates but do
have the power to hire and fire principals.
   The other members are two people who are not parents of enrolled
students, who are elected by the public at large in the school's
district, two teachers at the school, and the principal of the
school.
   Last year, the selection of principals by local school councils
was hotly contested at many of the city's schools. Some principals
charged they were dismissed by their school's council solely on the
basis of race.
   Skirmishes in which police were called broke out at at least two
schools where students and parents were dissatisfied with the
councils' actions.
   In his dissent, Justice William G. Clark said the act ``is a
unique and creative response to the education problems facing
Chicago.''
   He said the different treatment of parents and other voters
should be evaluated by the court to see if there is a ``rational
basis'' for it, rather than just rejected out of hand under a
strict reading of the one-person, one-vote rule.
   Attorneys for the Chicago Board of Education and other
defendants in the case had argued that the ``one-person one-vote''
principle doesn't apply to subordinate panels of limited authority
such as the local school councils.
margin in the House and signed into law by Gov. James R. Thompson.
   Its passage followed a 19-day teachers' strike in 1987 and was
intended to battle the high dropout rate and poor test scores that
led then-federal education secretary William Bennett to call
Chicago's schools the nation's worst.
   The high court's decision came on an appeal of Circuit Judge
Robert Sklodowski's ruling of Aug. 29, 1989, upholding the law's
constitutionality.

   Two American women say they are optimistic
that Saddam Hussein will release their husbands after they arrive
in Iraq next week on a trip the State Department has tried to
discourage.
   ``I am so sure he is coming out,'' Kim Edwards, of Carson CIty,
Nev., said of her husband, Tony.
   Mrs. Edwards, the mother of three small children, plans to
travel on Monday to Jordan and then Baghdad, Iraq, with a group of
more than a dozen other people.
   Members of the group have husbands or relatives who have been
Held in Iraq or Kuwait since Saddam invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   President Bush criticized Saddam for his treatment of the
hostages and their families at a news conference today.
   He condemned Iraq's ``cynical and brutal policy'' of ``forcing
people to beg for their (the hostages') release, parceling out
human lives to families and traveling emissaries like so much
chattel.''
   Bush also said he would dispatch Secretary of State James A.
Baker III to Baghdad in an effort to resolve the PErsian Gulf
crisis peacefully. But Bush insisted Saddam must withdraw
unconditionally from Kuwait.
   Mrs. EDwards' husband was working as a planner for a Japanese
company in BAghdad at the time of the invasion. She said she has
talked with him several times.
   Barbara Smiley of Los Angeles said she believes the only way
Saddam will free hostages is if the relatives ask for them in
person. Saddam invited the families to come to Baghdad, saying
people who arrive without guns will not leave empty-handed.
   Mrs. Smiley said she was frustrated by the situation until she
decided to travel to Iraq.
   ``When I made the decision to travel, I was taking control,''
she said. Her husband, Edward, was working for a Kuwaiti company as
a database administrator when the invasion occurred.
   She and the others opted to visit Iraq because they feel the
State Department is not working hard enough to free the hostages.
   The State Department has repeatedly urged American families not
to go to Iraq. U.S. officials say it is dangerous and they cannot
guarantee security.
   Moreover, they say the families can expect to be used as
``propaganda pawns'' by Saddam.
   Nevertheless, at least four American families have traveled to
Iraq.

   WASHINGTON: few questions.
   Tom?
   Q. Mr. President, now that you have a clearcut UN resolution on
use of force, doesn't that force you into a position - if these
talks between the Secretary of State break down - doesn't this
force you into the position of having to use force on January 15th
if Saddam Hussein hasn't left? And if -- if not, won't we be seen
as the one that blinked first?
   A. No, the date was not a date at which point force had to be
used.
   Q. If I could just follow up -
   A. Yeah.
   Q. With another question. Are you going to ask Congress for
approval of this - this resolution? Would you like to see Congress
pass the same kind of resolution as the UN?
   A. I'd - I'd love to see Congress pass a resolution
enthusiastically endorsing what the United NAtions has done, yes.
But we're in consultation on that, and I have no plans to call a
special session. I'm not opposed to it. But we are involved in
consultations right now. I have talked to several members of
Congress. I've talked to leaders in the House. I've talked to
several on the Republican side and Democratic side in the Senate.
And I want to be sure that these consultations are complete.
   Some feel a lame duck session is not good, that the new members
should have a right to have a say. Others feel that we ought to
move right now. The Congress, as you know, in their adjournment
resolution had a provision in there that they could come back and
take this up. They are a coequal branch of government. They can do
that if they want to.
   But I - we will continue our consultations. They'll follow,
incidentally, today, this, with - meeting with the leadership. So
I'll get a little better feel for that as we go along.
   Q. Mr. President, you say you're confident that American troops
will prevail against Saddam if called upon.
   A. Oh, absolutely.
   Q. But at what price? How many Americans?
   A. Well, I can't give you that -- I can't give you that, any
figures, of course. But I can say that the movement of this
additional force safeguards the lives of every American and every
one of our allies in the Gulf.
   Yeah, Brit?
   Q. Mr. President, in recent days, senior members of the
administration have emphatically rejected the idea of any special
emissaries or diplomatic envoys to or from Iraq to discuss this on
your part. What changed your mind, sir?
   A. The United Nations resolution, I think, has a good chance of
making Saddam Hussein understand what it is he's up against. I have
not felt that he got the message. I hope this will do it. But I am
convinced that these two direct meetings that I've discussed here
will guarantee to all the people of the world, certainly to the
American people, that Saddam Hussein not misunderstand, not
misinterpret - I keep hearing, ``Well, people won't give him the
news.''
and bad news very faithfully, I am told that Saddam Hussein's
troops don't bring him the bad news. And I'm told that he is
somewhat isolated. And I think this UN resolution will help in a
sense to de-isolate him. And I think the two proposals that I've
made here will help. And so, it's just going the extra step, Brit,
that's what it is.
   Q. Well, how -
   A. And it's a decision that I personally made.
   Q. You indicate that this date is not actually a deadline for
the use of force, merely a date after which force would be
Permissible. How do you avoid the impression, should that date come
and go without military action, that the U.S.-led coalition has, in
fact, blinked?
   A. Well, we've got to look at events at the time. But I don't
think there will ever be a perception that the United States is
going to blink in this situation. That's why I had some of the
words in this statement that I had. Yeah?

   A local court permitted a woman to publicly
beat her husband before it granted him a divorce, United News of
India reported Friday.
   The beating occurred Oct. 7 but went unreported until a social
organization, apparently outraged by the incident, complained to
the government. No further action has been taken.
   The man, from a town in the western Gujarat state, was seeking a
divorce from his first wife to marry another woman, the news agency
reported. She agreed, on condition that he first submit to a
beating.
   Under Indian law, Hindus can have only one wife at a time. The
law does not apply to Moslems, who are permitted up to four wives.
   Gujarat is the home state of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who led India's
struggle for freedom against English rule and preached ``ahimsa,''
or non-violence.

   A mob stormed a jail and burned to death a
man and his three sons who had been arrested on charges of killing
a shopkeeper, police said Friday.
   About 1,500 people surrounded the jail in La Mana, a village 71
miles southeast of Quito, forcing the guards to flee, police said.
The crowd then spread gasoline and set fire to the jail.
   ``In a few minutes the whole building was ablaze. The four
arrested men cried asking help but their cries were ignored by the
perpetrators of such terrible crimes,'' the newspaper El Comercio
of Quito said Friday.
   The men inside the jail, Juan Flores and his sons Freddy, German
and Nelson, had been arrested the day before under suspicion of
robbing and stabbing to death a shopkeeper.
   According to police, agents searching the Flores' house found
many items that had been stolen from the man's shop.

   Defense Minister Moshe Arens on Friday canceled
the construction of two submarines on order at a German shipyard,
saying Israel didn't have the money to pay for them.
   THe two Dolphin-class submarines would have been built for $570
million at the HDW shipyard in Kiel. Construction was to have
started in a few months.
   Israel needs the money for other projects, Arens said.
   ``The defense budget has been eroded in the past few years, and
this at a time when our needs are growing, especially because of
the gulf crisis,'' he said.
   In the 1991 state budget approved by the government this week,
$6.2 billion was set aside for defense. In the past, the defense
budget was always the largest item in government spending, but this
year it is second to the $6.5 million earmarked for the immigration
wave from the Soviet Union.
   Israel has three Vickers 206 submarines, but they soon will be
outdated, said Zeev Eitan, a researcher at the Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University.
   Eitan said several Arab countries, including Syria, EGypt, Libya

   Americans who have been living off canned tuna
and rice at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait have received fruit,
vegetables and a case of cigarettes from the Iraqis, President Bush
said today.
   A group of Iraqis who showed up with the goods Thursday said
they would return with a second delivery, including soft drinks, on
Saturday, Bush said during televised remarks on the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Bush said the Iraqis told the Americans to make a list of
medical supplies they needed, too.
   He called the Iraqis' move an ``interesting development'' but
noted that electricity was still cut off at the AMerican Embassy
compound in Iraq-occupied Kuwait, where eight U.S. diplomats and 19
private citizens are holding out.
   ``This could be a positive sign, but it's so far short of
compliance with international law that I can't be rejoicing,'' Bush
said.
   Bush, who said he had received the report of the delivery this
morning, said he had been asked what would happen if the Iraqis
provoked him regarding the Americans still holding out at the U.S.
outpost.
   ``Consider me provoked when Iand medical equipment,'' Bush said.
   In the past, Bush has said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was
trying to ``starve them out.''
   The grounds at the seaside compound are surrounded by Iraqi
troops, and no one is permitted to enter or leave. The four men and
women picked by the State Department to stay behind have kept the
embassy operating despite the lack of electricity and water.
   In the three weeks between the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the
Aug. 24 IRaqi deadline for shutting down all diplomatic facilities
in the capital, Americans stocked up on non-perishable food and
bottled water.
   The Americans have been surviving on canned tuna, supplemented
by rice and fresh dates that grow on the compound.
   Their main assignment is to keep in contact with the 600 or so
Americans who are still in hiding in Kuwait to avoid being rounded
up and added to the ranks of the ``human shield'' Saddam has
assembled to protect strategic installations from attack.

   WASHINGTON: had. Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, you've - you've just spoken about the weapons
of mass destruction and nuclear weapons, and also that one of your
goals is to try to reach stability in the region. Can you reach
Stability in the region with Saddam Hussein in power?
   A. I think most countries - members of the United Nations - feel
that there have to be some safeguards put into effect in terms of
Guaranteeing the security and stability of the Gulf. And so, I
would think that the status quo ante will not be enough, and I
think there will be - there are sanctions in place now, and I think
it would be very proper to discuss what those safeguards should be
after there has been a - a total compliance with the United Nations
resolutions.
   Q. Well you - but, sir, could I just follow up?
   A. Yeah.
   Q. I just noticed that when you were originally - when you
outlined your goals you included stability in the region. You - you
seemed to summarize them when you talk about these talks with
Saddam Hussein, but you didn't - you only mentioned the first
three; you didn't mention stability in the region.
   A. Well was I talking about the UN resolution - which security
and stability I don't think was a part of the UN resolution. It is
certainly part of the world's objective, however. I think that may
be the technical difference.
   But look, it is critical, and it is very, very important. Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, I want to ask if your comments about the
Kuwaiti Embassy - whether it's fair to conclude, based on those,
that you will neither close the embassy nor permit those Americans
to be starved out.
   A. I will not say exactly what I will do or exactly what I won't
do. There is a very interesting report that we got in this morning
saying that some Iraqis showed up at the Kuwaiti embassy, our
embassy in Kuwait, and had delivered fruit, vegetables, and a case
of Iraqi cigarettes to EMbassy Kuwait. And apparently there's going
to be another delivery tomorrow, including soda pop. And they asked
what medical supplies were required. And -
   Q. (Military ?) -
   A. It doesn't say that. ANd the embassy will apparently provide
a list tomorrow. And the electricity is still cut off. So this is
kind of an interesting little development. But I -- somebody said
to me, ``Well, hey, what about if there's some provocation?'' They
asked me in the leaderhship meeting. I said, ``Consider me provoked
when it comes to the United States embassy. Consider me provoked
when I see Americans without proper food and medical equipment.''
   Q. Sir, just -
   Q. May I - may I follow this -
   A. Yes.
   Q. Do you take it from that - from that communique that you've
received there that the Iraqis have the message and want to
eliminate that as a potential tripwire?
   A. I don't know. It's too - it's the best question, right on
target, one that we were discussing inside. ANd I - let's try to be
optimistic and say this is - this could be a positive sign. But
it's so far short of compliance with international law that I can't
be rejoicing. But it is a very interesting development.
   Q. Sir -
   A. Yeah -
   Q. Are you -
   A. I'm sorry. Yeah, John?
   Q. You've been getting some pretty negative comments up on the
Hill in these hearings, as you know, this week. Now this morning
you said this would not be a long, protracted Vietnam-type war.
However, General Odom of the - former head of the NSA, testified
just this morning before the Senate Armed Serviceswe'd have to be there
for decades. Now presumably he means even
after military combat we'd have to have people in place there as
part of a peacekeeping force. Do you see our commitment there to
extend that far?
   A. No, I don't.
   Q. Let me ask you something else. Al Gore yesterday takes issue
with your comments and the comments of some of your aides, such as
Brent Scowcroft, aboUt Saddam being able to churn out a nuclear
weapon within a matter of months. Gore, who's had some private
briefings apparently from some of these people, indicates that your
administration's statements are misleading -
   A. I disagree with the Senator, and if he wants to gamble on the
future about the construction of atomic weapons by Saddam Hussein,
I don't. And I know what the intelligence says, every bit of it.
And I can't share it obviously because we don't comment on
intelligence matters. But I am concerned, and the very first time I
spoke on this subject, I think in August, I mentioned weapons of
mass destruction, I believe, but certainly early on.
   And I am concerned about it. And if Senator Gore has a
difference of opinion and is not concerned about it, we just have
an honest difference there.
   I am concerned about Saddam Hussein's attempt to accelerate the
possession of a construction or possession of a nuclear weapon, and
I might as well share that as honestly as I can.

   Thousands of Beijing schoolchildren are being
taken to a museum exhibit that depicts U.S. soldiers watching as
Nationalist Chinese police torture Communist prisoners in the
1940s.
evidence AMericans had anything to do with mistreatment of
prisoners by the NAtionalist CHinese, who were U.S. Allies in World
War II.
   But that is never made clear in the popular ``Exhibit of
Historical Facts About the Concentration Camp at the Place of
CHinese-U.S. Cooperation,'' which actually tells the story of two
prisons in China's wartime capital of Chungking.
   From the exhibit name to the photographs and statues depicting
Americans training Nationalist Chinese police, the implication is
that Americans were responsible for the torture and deaths of
hundreds of CHinese COmmunists at the hands of Nationalists during
the 1930s and 1940s.
   ``The Nationalists were manipulated by the Americans,'' said
Yuan Shigui of the Capital Museum, where the exhibit is being shown
for nearly six weeks. Chungking in southwest China has a permanent
memorial to the prisons' inmates.
   The exhibit seems out of step with the current warming trend in
U.S.-Chinese relations. The friction triggered by China's June 1989
army attack on pro-democracy demonstrators has eased, and most U.S.
sanctions against China have crumbled.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was in Washington on FRiday
for the first official high-level Chinese visit since Beijing's
crackdown.
   Still, the official Chinese media continues to level frequent
criticism at the U.S. political and social system and the U.S.
government-run radio station, Voice of America.
   The Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, frequently
carries editorials warning against ``hostile forces in the West''
who seek to convert socialist countries to capitalism. Other recent
articles have derided U.S. democracy as an illusion perpetrated by
the rich upon the working class.
   With the party urging better ideological training of the young,
the exhibit is being used as an educational tool - not just for its
criticism of U.S. ties to the Nationalists but for its praise of
Communist ``martyrs.''
   It includes dozen of photographs of party members tortured or
killed by the Nationalists. It says the Nationalists killed 180
prisoners in one night in 1949 as Communist troops prepared to
capture Chungking in the final stages of a civil war won by the
Communists.
   ``This is a very important exhibit,'' Yuan said. ``We held it in
keeping with the needs of current education in patriotism and
internationalism, in order to carry out the excellent tradition''
of the slain Communists.
   About 33,000 people, mostly schoolchildren and workers on
organized trips, visited the exhibit in its opening week. It has
been shown in 18 Chinese cities in the past two years.
   The exhibIt says that U.S. NAval intelligence officers and
Nationalist secret police set up a Chinese-U.S. SPecial Technology
Cooperation Institute in 1943 to share war intelligence and train
Nationalist police.
   The U.S. participants moved into a building that had been used
as a prison since 1939, the exhibit said. With their arrival, the
prison was moved to a nearby site. When the Americans left in 1947,
the building they had occupied again became a prison. These two
prisons are the ``concentration camp'' of the exhibit title.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell confirmed there was such
a U.S.-Chinese technology group, but said he had no details of its
activities. The United States gave substantial loans and arms to
the Nationalists during the 1940s, seeking to bolster them in the
fight against Japan.
   The exhibit said the U.S. officers in Chungking also ``acted as
accessories to the Nationalists in smashing the (Communist)
revolutionary movement.'' Yuan accused them of supporting the
establishment of the prisons.
   However, Li Hua, director of the Chungking memorial, said in a
telephone interview that there is no evidence of direct American
involvement.
   He said Americanssaid the exhibit's statues of U.S. officers supervising
torture
sessions ``do not show something that actually happened in the
prison.'' He did not respond when asked the purpose of the statues.
   Li said the exhibit was not intended to arouse anti-American
sentiment or influence current U.S.-Chinese relations.
   ``The events of history need not affect today,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON: I can.
   Q. Are you saying you think he could develop a warhead next
year?
   A. I'm not giving you a time frame, but there - you've seen the
estimates, some of which, Ithere's a lot of scientists that come down on
different sides. And
Senator Gore, I'm sure, is an intelligence fellow, and he - but I
don't think he has access to absolutely all - maybe he does - but I
am not going to err on the side of - on the side of underestimation
when it comes to this question. Yes, sir, Charlie?
   Q. Mr. President, your announcement about Tariq Aziz and
Secretary Baker - have you had any signals, any indications from
the Iraqis, that they would welcome this, that they are indeed
looking for this kind of communication?
   A. No. The only thing I've heard is that they want to talk.
There's an opportunity, but no, I have not had any - even
diplomatic signals or signals of other kinds.
   Q. And of those 26 nations that you list in the area, how many
of those are equally committed to offensive action, rather than
just defensive action?
   A. I can't give you the answer to that because I don't really
know. But I expect that there is enthusiasm in all quarters of
those countries for the UN action that was taken yesterday.
   Q. With all respect, shouldn't you know how many would follow
your troops into battle?
   A. I know that what I said is true about the - if we have to go
into battle, and I am satisfied I know enough about that. I went
over in detail, as one well imagine a president should because I
have the responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, what might happen if
we have to use force. I repeat, I hope we'll never have to have one
Single shot fired in anger. Yeah?
   Q. Iraq has been constantly calling for dialogue. Aren't you
concerned that those two missions, Tariq Aziz and James Baker, will
lead Saddam Hussein to claim that the U.S. is showing a sign of
weakness?
   A. That what?
   Q. That the U.S. is weakening?
   A. Because Baker goes to Baghdad?
   Q. Aren't you concerned that that would be the position of
Saddam Hussein?
   A. No, I'm not. I'm concerned some might say this is an
ultimatum in which it is - all it is is an effort to be sure that
he understands the commitment of the United States, that he
understands that anything that is done must be done inside the
confines of the United Nations resolutions that have been passed,
that there will be no contingency.
   There can be no face saving. That's not what this is about. This
is to be sure that he understands how strongly the President of the
United States feels about implementing to a tee, without - without
concession - the United Nations position.
   And some have told me that he's not getting the message of how
determined we are. And I can't think of any better way to do it at
this juncture, in the wake of the UN resolution, than this
face-to-face - face-to-face meeting. I'm not sure he'll agree to
it. Yes, Ann?
   Q. Today's press conference seems to amount to, again, more talk
of preparation for war. Can you describe what you think your
responsibilities are, in terms of Congress, as we head into thi
period, since they seem to think that and agree that you're
consulting - talking, but not - you seem reluctant to go and get a
resolution that mimicks the UN resolution. What do you think your
responsibilities are to Congress and to the people that elected
them?
   A. Full consultation.
   Q. ANy more than telling -
   A. Get them in on the - huh?
   Q. Any more than telling them before you do - you do something?
   A. I'm leveling with them on where I think - think matters are
right now, and I - I'm - you've put your interpretation on my
remarks. There was plenty of comments in there about hoping that we
will have a peaceful resolution; that the best answer to get a
peaceful resolution is to have Saddam Hussein know how determined
everybody is.
   You see, I think yesterday's UN resolution was a step towards
peace, not a step towards war, because IHussein finally gets the message
and understands what he's up
against in terms of world opinion and other things, that - that he
will do that in Kuwait which he did in - in Iran. Yes?

during his career, was killed when he was struck by a car on
Interstate 95.
   ``IT's certainly a sad day for us. Naturally, we feel like we

   Troopers Mike King and Mike Smith stopped a rented truck on the
highway for following a car too closely Thursday afternoon in St.

   The truck driver appeared nervous, so troopers asked for
permission to search the truck. The troopers found a bag of
marijuana and Smith, who worked with and cared for the dog, brought
Major in for a more extensive search, Brown said.
   The 1{-year-old dog had trouble getting into the truck, darted
onto the highway and was struck by a car.

<TEXT>
   Alleged serial killer Henry LEe Lucas,
scheduled to die Monday for a 1979 slaying, won a stay from the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
   Lucas was granted a reprieve Thursday, a day after the same
court rejected a stay for the one-eyed drifter on other grounds.
   Lucas, 54, had once claimed to have killed nearly 600 people in
26 states, touching off a flurry of headlines and visits from
investigators from across the natiojn. But he later recanted his
Confessions to all the slayings except one - that of his mother.
   The appeals court said Thursday it would consider a claim by
Lucas' attorneys that the trial jury should have been able to
consider mitigating circumstances before sentencing him to death,
said assistant Texas Attorney General Bob Walt.
   On Wednesday, the court had rejected a claim that the trial
COurt did not have the authority to set Lucas' execution date.
   He said Wednesday that he might have confessed to as many as
4,000 crimes because of threats against him or promises made to
him.
   Lucas was scheduled to die before dawn Monday for the slaying of
a woman known only as ``Orange Socks,'' which is all she was
wearing when her body was found Oct. 31, 1979, next to a culvert
near Interstate 35 north of Georgetown.
   Lucas contends he was in Florida at the time of the Orange SOcks
slaying and was forced by police to confess.
   The Orange Socks conviction is Lucas' only death sentence
although he has at least six other life terms, two 75-year
sentences and a 60-year term for other Texas convictions. He also
is wanted in FLorida on three first-degree murder charges for
slayings in 1980 and 1981.

   The handful of U.S. diplomats holding out in
the U.S. Embassy in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait are receiving food
deliveries from Iraqis and have been promised medical supplies,
President Bush said Friday.
   BUsh described the report as ``very interesting'' and said it
could be a positive sign.
   The president discussed the development at a news conference in
which he invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to Washington
and said he would send Secretary of State James A Baker III to
Baghdad in an effort to end the crisis peacefully and still get
Iraq out of Kuwait.
   ``There is a very interesting report that we got in this morning
saying that some Iraqis showed up at ... our embassy in Kuwait and
had delivered fruit, vegetables, and a case of Iraqi cigarettes,''
Bush said.
   The eight U.S. diplomats and 19 private citizens holed up at the
seaside compound have been surviving on canned tuna, rice and fresh
dates that grow there.
   Bush said the embassy was to provide a list of needed medical
supplies, and another delivery was expected on Saturday to include
soft drinks.
   Earlier in the news conference Bush cited the treatment of the
embassy as one reason for a tough stance against Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein.
   ``The flag is still flying there. A handful of beleaguered
Americans remain inside the embassy, unable to come and go. This
treatment of our embassy violates every civilized principle of
diplomacy,'' the president said, adding that he was determined to
replenish the embassy.
   ``What kind of precedent will these actions set for the future
if Saddam's violation of international law goes unchallenged?''
Bush asked.
   In response to a later question, he described the delivery.
   ``So this is kind of an interesting little development,'' he
said. `` ... Let's try to be optimistic and say this is ... this
could be a positive sign. But it's so far short of compliance with
International law that I can't be rejoicing. But it is a very
interesting development.''

<TEXT>
   Broadcasting from his citizen's band radio
pulpit, a barber-turned-preacher dispenses guidance for the soul
and directions for the road to his congregation of truckers.
   They call the Rev. S. Anthony BAttaglia The Chaplain Man.
   BAttaglia, 60, found a new calling when the Baltimore Port Truck
Plaza wanted to hire a citizen's band radio buff to guide tired,
hungry and lost drivers on the busy Interstate 95 corridor.
   ``He's a right responsible fellow. He's kind of a caretaker
around here. He helpsgguys who get into a bind,'' said Steve
NEwton, a former driver who is now a trucking agent in Baltimore.
   Sandwiched between a gift shop - complete with mud flap
ornaments including the popular chrome reclining nude - and a
coin-operated laundry, Battaglia mans his radio pulpit in the
security office of the truck stop's motel.
   Every weekday from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m., Battaglia sits with his
imitation leather Bible at a desk piled with a 40-channel CB radio,
police scanners, atlases and phone books.
   Battaglia, an ordained Baptist minister, is a chaplain at a
suburban Baltimore church and a volunteer chaplain for the
Baltimore County police and fire departments. HE wears his fire
department uniform to the truck stop in case he gets a call.
   He spent 30 years as a barber, then switched directions and
worked as a real estate agent.
   Now, his congregation includes drivers with handles such as
``The Rubber Duck,'' ``Low Rider,'' and ``The DEstroyer.''
   ``How 'bout that Chaplain Man?,'' one driver calls out. ``We got
an abandoned trailer. IT's an Evergreen.''
   Another driver leaving the Fort McHenry Tunnel wants directions
to EAstern Avenue.
   ``That driver coming out of the hole, that exit is 5-9,''
Battaglia replies. ``This is the Baltimore Port Truck Plaza
welcoming you to Baltimore.''
   That greeting is about as much as he is allowed to say on the
air waves about the truck stop, because Federal Communications
Commission regulations forbid advertisements over the radio.
   ``Basically we're here to help the drivers. When they come into
Baltimore its one big maze of streets,'' Battaglia said.
   ``Truckers are lonely, too. They have marital problems. They can
feel free to come in for counsel,'' he said.
   ``I tell them, `SOmetimes you just have to make a decision to go
out on your own with your own truck.' Or if things are slow, they
Need someone to encourage them, to tell them to just hang on.''

   Iraq today rejected the use-of-force
resolution approved by the Security Council, but an IRaqi
ambassador welcomed President Bush's offer to send his secretary of
state to Baghdad for talks.
   In a nationally televised news conference today, Bush said he is
willing to send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad on
a diplomatic mission to negotiate Iraq's unconditional withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   Bush said, however, that if military conflict does break out,
``It will not be another Vietnam, this will not be another
protracted, drawn-out war.''
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi leadership was taken by surprise by BUsh's
announcement about BAker and went immediately into a meeting to
discuss the development, diplomats said. It was not known who
attended the meeting.
   However, Iraq's ambassador to France, Abdul Razzack al Hashimi,
spke positively of the proposed Baker visit.
   ``This is a very important step, really, toward peace, and we
hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for,
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war. ... I consider it
very good news,'' he said.
   Speaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.,
the Iraqi ambassador said: ``The point is not Kuwait. The problem
is much much bigger than that. The whole security of the world is
in jeopardy in the region today. ... So let's talk about it in that
sense. That's what is important.''
   ``We are not accepting pre-condition negoatiations,'' he told
the BBC in Paris. ``Let's wait and see, and let's be optimistic,
and see what Mr. Baker has in mind, and not to speculate about such
an important event.''
   BusH's news conference came one day after the U.N. Security
Council voted 12 to 2 Thursday to authorize the United States and
its allies to use force to drive Iraq from Kuwait if Saddam Hussein
has not withdrawn his troops by Jan. 15. China abstained; Yemen and
Cuba voted against.
   It was only the second time in the 45-year history of the United
Nations that the council authorized the use of force to counter
aggression. The first time was in 1950 during the Korean conflict.
   Saddam's ruling Revolutionary Command Council today called the
U.N. measure ``illegal, null and void,'' saying it was imposed by
the United States.
   ``It is first and foremost an American decision in which certain
powers participated only under American pressure,'' it said. ``The
United States practiced all forms of pressure, terrorism and
bribes'' to pass the resolution.
   The statement, broadcast on state-run Baghdad Radio, said Iraq
would teach the United States and its allies a ``hard lesson,
unprecedented in history.''
   IN Tokyo today, MIsoji Sakamoto, the top government spokesman,
voiced support for the resolution, and in Madrid, government
spokeswoman, Rosa Conde, said Spain also backed the measure. The
German government said today that peace in the Mideast was ``in
Iraq's hands.''
Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, would be welcome in Washington
for talks the week of Dec. 10. Bush said Baker would travel to
Baghdad between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15.
   Bush said, however, that he would not waiver in demanding a
total Iraqi withdrawal, restoration of the Kuwaiti government and
release of all hostages.
   Th president combined his surprise diplomatic overture with
words of warning for Saddam. He said that if hostilities occur, ``I
promise you there will not be any murky ending. I will never agree
to a halfway effort.''
   ``I don't think there has ever been a question that the United
States is going to blink'' in this situation, Bush said.
   Oil prices tumbled this morning after Bush held out the
possibility of a diplomatic solution to the gulf crisis. Oil
dropped $2.11 per barrel to $30.80 on the NEw York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Thirteen foreign ministers attended Thursday's extraordinary
Security Council session, with Baker presiding, making it one of
the highest-level meetings in council history.
   The resolution, however, did not address whether the U.S.-led
multinational force in the gulf could take action in the event of
an Iraqi provocation prior to Jan. 15, such as harming the Western
hostages it is holding.
   It also made no mention of a U.N. military command or any U.N.
role in overseeing any military operation. The Soviet Union has
said Soviet forces only would be committed to a military operation
under U.N. auspices.
   But in New York Thursday, Soviet Foreign MInister Eduard
Shevardnadze said the only thing that could force Moscow to
intervene in the conflict would be ``a threat to the lives and
security of Soviet citizens in Iraq.''
   ``We will take all the necessary steps in this case. Everybody
should know that we will not hesitate to use force to protect our
citizens,'' Shevardnadze told the Soviet news agency Tass in an
interview from New York.
   The council resolution strengthens Bush's hand with Congress and
the American people in calling for offensive action against
Baghdad.
   But hearings on the gulf crisis continued on Capitol Hill today
with a former top-ranking intelligence official saying the United
States should maintain a defensive posture in Saudi Arabia rather
than wage war with Iraq.
   Retired Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, who headed the National
Security Agency during the Reagan administration, said attacking
Iraqi forces in Kuwait - or Iraq itself - could mean a long U.S.
military presence in the region.
   On Thursday, former Navy Secretary James Webb added his voice to
those questioning Bush's plan to send 200,000 more troops to Saudi
Arabia to back up the 240,000 already there.
   The LOs Angeles Times said today the additional aircraft will
include a second squadron of F-117 Stealth fighters and additional
F-15E ground-attack jets, F-16 fighters, A-16 tank-killers,
refueling tankers and RF-4C photo-reconnaissance jets.
   The deployment, which will begin as early as this week, will
boost the number of U.S. AIr Force planes in the gulf to 1,200, the
Times said.

   WASHINGTON: the hilt.
   And that's why -- because of that question that weighs on my
mind, I added that language this morning about how this will not be
a Vietnam. They can criticize me for moving force, and if we've got
one kid that's apt to be in harm's way, I want him backed up to the
hilt by American firepower and others as well.
   And that's why I'm working as hard as I am, not only to hold
this coalition together, but to strengthen it. And the best way to
safeguard the lives of Americans is for Saddam Hussein to do that
which he should have done long ago. And if force has to be used,
the best way to safeguard lives is to see that you've got the best
And you're willing to use it. And that's my posture. Now, let's
see, Sarah. Fire away.
   Q. Sir, why do you seem to be avoiding the people's
representatives having an opportunity to talk on this and to
express their opinion? You know Congress, and yet you're avoiding
it. And you know that the Constitution gives them power not only to
declare war, to provide the money and to say other things about
what shall be done with troops. That's the Constitution. Yet you
seem to be avoiding that. The experts on Capitol Hill say that what
you have done by pre-notification, calling two or three members and
saying to them, ``We're on the way,'' you've already made the
decision, you're just notifying them, that's pre-notification;
that's not consulting with Congress. They say you should sit down
and have a back-and-forth with them -
   A. Yes, but -
   Q. - and I will remind you that when Foley speaks as Speaker of
the HOuse, he may be Speaker of the House, but he sure as hell
doesn't represent Florida or Texas.
   A. Well, now, Sarah, therein you brought up the - properly
brought up the dilemma I face. There are 435 members of the United
States Congress. There are 100 -
   Q. Well -
   A. May I finish, please? There are 100 members of the United
States Senate. Each one has a view as to what I ought not to do.
And that's fine. THey have the power under the resolution of
adjournment to come back 20 seconds from now, and to take a voice,
to stand, to take a common position. If they want to come back here
and endorse what the President of the United States has done and
what the United Nations Security Council has done - come on, we're
ready. I'd like to see it happen.
   But what I don't want to do is have it come back and end up
where you have 435 voices in one House and 100 on the other saying
what not to do, and saying - kind of a hand-wringing operation that
would send bad signals.
   I welcome these hearings. We are having hearings. We are
consulting. I've told you I'm consulting. Ill be honest with you.
I cannot consult with 535 strong-willed individuals. I can't do it,
nor does my responsibility under the Constitution compel me to do
that. And I think everyone would agree that we have had more
Consultations than - than previous administrations.
   Q. Sir, we have a majority rule in this country, and you seem to
be afraid of it.
of government, and I know my - I know my strengths and I know the
limitations on the presidency. This is an interesting debate,
Sarah. (Laughter) And - (chuckles) - and I - and I know my
limitations. And I know what I can do, and I know what previous
presidents have done. And I am still determined to consult the
extra mile. Do you want to continue to debate? You've -
   Q. Well, sir, you seem to give - you and Jim Baker give the
other countries a chance to talk, and you give the United Nations a
chance to talk, but you won't give tHe United STates people a
chance to debate with you.
   Q. Is there a question in there somewhere?
   A. Well, now, that's an absurd comment, Sarah, from a bright
person like you. That is absolutely absurd. They're holding
hearings. They're talking. They have the power under the
adjournment resolution to reconvene this minute. Some in the House
want to come back now. Some want to talk about it later on. Some in
the Senate want to come right back now and immediately endorse what
the President has done and what the Security Council resolution is,
and I'm for that. But some don't. And so consultation is going on.
   Please do not assign to me improper motives. We're -- they're
talking right now. They're having endless hearings by endless
experts up there, each one with a slightly different view. And
that's the American way. And that's fine. And I know what the
responsibilities of the president are, and I am fulfilling those
responsibilities.
   Q. Thank you.
   Q. Thank you.
   Q. What about China? What happened with China?
   Q. Thank you.

   Lobbyists dubbed ``angels'' secretly
provided cash, meals, and other gifts to legislators during a
free-wheeling political era led by a senator who is now a state
Supreme Court justice, documents allege.
prohibits lobbyists from providing, and lawmakers from accepting,
any gifts, including even a cup of coffee.
   Documents released Thursday detailed allegations by Lobbyist
Gary R. Goyke and others that Justice William A. BAblitch was the
``inventor'' of a practice in the 1970s and 1980s that coerced
lobbyists to pay for lawmakers' food and liquor.
   Lobbyists would often be called at home and asked to be
``angels,'' meaning they were expected to pay for lawmakers' food,
drinks or lodging, Goyke told investigators.
   After Bablitch began the practice, lawmakers sought such gifts
as free meals and drinks, $100 golf bags, sporting event tickets,
lodging, art pieces and even financial assistance for a movie deal,
the documents said.
   Bablitch, a Democrat who served as majority leader of the
Wisconsin Senate from 1977 to 1981 before being elected to the
state's highes court, denied the allegations.

released Thursday by the state Justice DEpartment with the
completion of a two-year investigation into influence peddling at
the Capitol. THe probe resulted in more than $35,000 in fines
against two dozen lawmakers and lobbyists. Only one person, a state
senator, was sent to jail.
   Prosecutors have said some of the lobbyists and lawmakers
implicated in the documents were not charged because the wrongdoing
occurred too long ago to be prosecuted.
   Goyke, who served in the SEnate before becoming a lobbyist, was
among those fined for providing illegal gifts to lawmakers.
   He said he first became familiar with Bablitch's practices as a
freshman senator in 1974, when he and another lawmaker had dinner
with Bablitch and were told the bill would be covered by a coffee
fund.
   Goyke said he later learned the fund was bankrolled by
lobbyists. Goyke said after becoming a lobbyist he was frequently
asked to be an ``angel'' and would agree to allow lawmakers to use
his credit cards for bills.
weened his successor as Senate majority leader, Timothy Cullen, to
perpetuate the practice, Goyke said.
   Cullen, who later became secretary of the Department of Health
and Social Services, now works for an insurance company. A
secretary in his office in Evansville said he was unavailable for
comment.

   A Roman Catholic nun won a $13,000,
fire-engine-red sports car in a raffle to benefit her school.
   Sister Rebecca Berghoff, 65, said Thursday she was aghast when
she was declared the winner in the raffle for the St.
Joseph-Marquette School, where she is principal.
   She said she bought 30 $1 tickets for Saturday's drawing. About
32,000 tickets were sold for the school, which has 300 pupils in
kindergarten through eighth grade.
   She returned the Geo Storm to the dealer and said the refund
will help ease the school's budget problems.
   Besides, she said it wasn't appropriate ``for a nun to be
streaking around in a car like that.''
   Sister Berghoff has been a lucky gambler before. She said she
travels to Reno, Nev., to play slot machines every year and has won
as much as $500. ``I do enjoy it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   ---
   President Bush on Friday said that he is dispatching Secretary
of State James Baker III to Baghdad to discuss an ending to the
Gulf crisis, and that the Iraqi foreign minister would be welcome
in Washington for consultations the week of Dec. 10. He said Baker
would be available to travel to Iraq between Dec. 15 and the Jan.
15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ---
   Saddam's ruling Revolutionary Command Council on Friday called
the U.N. measure authorizing the United States and its allies to
use force to drive Iraq from Kuwait ``illegal, null and void,''
saying it was imposed by the United States.
   ``It is first and foremost an American decision in which certain
powers participated only under American pressure,'' it said. ``The
United States practiced all forms of pressure, terrorism and
bribes'' to pass the resolution.
   ---
   Abdul Razzack al Hashimi, Iraq's ambassador to France, speaking
in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. said of the
proposed Baker visit: ``This is a very important step, really,
toward peace, and we hope it is going to achieve what we are all
striving for, negotiations instead of beating the drums of war. ...
I consider it very good news.''
   ---
   In Tokyo on Friday, Misoji Sakamoto, the top government
spokesman, voiced support for the resolution, and in Madrid,
government spokeswoman, Rosa Conde, said Spain also backed the
measure. The German government said on Friday that peace in the
Mideast was ``in Iraq's hands.''
   ---
   The handful of U.S. diplomats holding out in the U.S. Embassy in
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait are receiving food deliveries from Iraqis and
have been promised medical supplies, President Bush said on Friday.
   ``There is a very interesting report that we got in this morning
saying that some Iraqis showed up at ... our embassy in Kuwait and
had delivered fruit, vegetables, and a case of Iraqi cigarettes,''
Bush said.
   The eight U.S. diplomats and 19 priate citizens holed up at the
seaside compound have been surviving on canned tuna, rice and fresh
dates that grow there.
   ---
   Oil prices tumbled Friday morning after President Bush held out
the possibility of a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Light sweet crude oil, which had been down about 80 cents a
barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange before Bush began his
news conference, fell sharply while the president was still on
television.
   Crude dropped to $30.80 per barrel, down $2.11, on contracts for
delivery in January.
   ---
   Retired Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, who headed the National
Security Agency during the Reagan administration, told Congress on
Friday he had ``no doubt that we could win'' an offensive action
against Saddam Hussein's forces.
   But Odom said attacking Iraqi forces in Kuwait - or Iraq itself
- could mean an even longer U.S. military presence in the region
than envisioned with the defensive posture now established.

<HEAD>FCC Reprimands Seattle Radio Station In Listener Contest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission
reprimanded a Seattle radio station Friday for failing to tell
listeners they could be disqualified from a $10,000 contest for
flooding the station with duplicate entries.
   At issue was a complaint by Patricia McBride-Nelson, a Seattle
real estate broker and mortgage loan officer who had sent in more
than 800 entries in a bid to win a contest in which listeners named
four songs played in a row without interruption.
   McBride-Nelson, who was disqualified before last spring's
drawing, said she bought an electric typewriter to speed up her
entries and listened to KSEA-FM ``continuously, sometimes until
2:30 a.m.''
   ``I carried my radio everywhere with me. I called in several
times a day to the deejays to confirm song titles that I wasn't
sure about,'' she said.
   ``I intended to do nothing else until the day of the drawing. I
intended to flood the barrel to give me the highest possible odds
of winning ... I was made to feel like a fool for even
participating in such an intense degree.''
   The FCC said the station repeatedly violated federal regulations
when it failed to ``fully and accurately disclose'' rules
prohibiting listeners from mailing in duplicate postcards that
listed the same set of songs.
   The commission decided a formal admonition was sufficient,
partly because KSEA offered to compensate the woman for postage and
stationary expenses she incurred entering the contest more than 800
times.
   Bruce Reese, a lawyer for the radio station's parent company,
said the FCC's ruling was appropriate.
   ``Short of throwing out the complaint, we view this as the
lowest rung on the ladder in disciplinary action the commission
could give us,'' Reese said.
   KSEA hoped the complaint would be dismissed because the station
took ``corrective steps'' and began broadcasting the rules more
fully a week after the contest began March 30, Reese said.
   McBride-Nelson, who has an unlisted telephone number, could not
be reached for comment.

<HEAD>Genetically Engineered Rats Help Doctors Understand a Human
Arthritis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers studying spinal arthritis and related
diseases report they have bred genetically engineered rats that
mimic the maladies in an important step toward developing
treatments.
   ``This is a significant piece of science,'' said Dr. Maxwell
Cowan, vice president and chief scientific officer of the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute at Bethesda, Md. ``The only reason that
the diseases could be understood is by developing an animal
model.''
   The institute and the Harold C. Simmons Arthritis Research
Center funded the work by scientists at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. The findings were reported
Friday in the journal Cell.
   The rats were bred with human genes for a protein molecule
called HLA-B27. It has been known since 1973 as a marker for a
group of arthritic diseases called spondyloarthropathies, said Dr.
Lawrence Shuman, director of the National Institute of Arthritis,
Musculoskeletal and Skin Disorders.
   When the rats given the genes got the symptoms, researchers said
they had confirmation HLA-B27 was a cause, not just a marker, of
the diseases, which affect about 200,000 mostly younger Americans.
   No new treatments for people have been developed from the
research, but the future is bright, said Dr. Joel D. Taurog, who
developed the genetic link with Dr. Robert Hammer, senior associate
at the Hughes institute.
   ``You can look for gold, but you can't plan to always find it,''
Taurog said. ``We can only hope that the lines of research that
lead from this development help prevent the diseases in the
future.''
   Among those optimistic about the research is the U.S. secretary
of health and human services.
   ``This convincing animal model will help reveal the mechanisms
that cause these arthritic disorders, which affect hundreds of
thousands of our young people,'' Dr. Louis W. Sullivan said.

<HEAD>Bush Considers Waiving Trade Restrictions On Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he would consider
waiving U.S. trade restrictions and provide the Soviet Union with
export credits to help reduce food shortages this winter.
   Bush, speaking at a news conference on the Persian Gulf crisis,
was asked whether recent Soviet support for his gulf policies had
made him more likely to offer food assistance to the Soviets.
   The president sad the two matters were ``totally separate and
unrelated.''
   But he expressed a ``willingness to entertain proposals for
food, especially if the reports prove to be accurate in terms of
the severe winter and the hardship that this will inflict on the
Soviet people.''
   Bush said he has asked top aides for recommendations by next
week on how to deal with a 1974 law that denies the Soviets coveted
most-favored-nation trade status because of their restrictions on
emigration.
   The president said he was undecided on whether to waive the
so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment and then offer the Soviets export
credits through the Agriculture Department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   ``It's an evolving ... question here. I don't know exactly what
I am going to do,'' he said.
   The Jackson-Vanik law barred all export credits or credit
guarantees to Soviet bloc countries that restricted emigration. It
also imposed tariffs on their exports to the United States.
   ``It has been my position that the Soviets should pass the
necessary emigration legislation,'' Bush said. ``That has not taken
place. But some are saying that I now have a clearer waiver
authority than I thought.''
   A credit package for Moscow would not be unprecedented. Former
President Nixon in 1972 unveiled a $750 million credit deal so the
Soviets could buy U.S. grain over three years. Moscow used about
$550 million of the credit line before the Jackson-Vanik
requirement halted further credit.
   On Friday, Bush said he felt that the U.S. trade restrictions
had been influential in increasing the emigration of Soviet Jews.
   ``We've been steadfast in encouraging the exodus of Soviet Jews,
so that will weigh on my consideration when I get down to have to
make this final decision on whether to waive Jackson-Vanik,'' the
president said.
   Bush said there were other, unspecified agricultural programs to
help the Soviets that could go forward which are unaffected by the
trade restrictions.
   The United States already sells the Soviets large amounts of
wheat under a 1985 ``export enhancement program'' that subsidizes
sales of some U.S. commodities to certain foreign buyers.
   Under the so-called EEP arrangement, as of Nov. 15 Moscow had
bought more than 21.3 million metric tons of wheat at subsidized
prices.

<TEXT>
   The resignation of Bulgaria's Socialist
premier calmed raging anti-Communist sentiment, but it hasn't done
anything to solve the country's deep economic and political crisis.
   Unrelenting pressure from the opposition in Parliament and from
strikes and street demonstrations forced Premier Andrei Lukanov and
his government of former Communists to leave office on Thursday.
   Tens of thousands of people cheered in the streets of Sofia, an
opposition stronghold.
   But Lukanov's demise may prove a Pyrrhic victory. The main
opposition group, the Union of Democratic Forces, must now prove it
can help solve Bulgaria's social and economic woes.
   ``Not even Jesus can fill Bulgarian stores,'' Lukanov said in a
recent speech.
   A new coalition government probably will be announced next week.
So far, nothing has been revealed about who will head it, whether
it will be a collection of nonpolitical experts or draw in equal
numbers on opposition parties and the still-powerful Socialists.
   The Union of Democratic Forces opposition had long criticized
Lukanov for mismanagement, demanding that he step down.
   But it is questionable whether anybody could manage Bulgaria's
economy, which is so dependent on the collapsing Soviet bloc that
it can only reflect the chaos of that disintegrating alliance.
   The opposition case against Lukanov always seemed to rest more
on a desire to get the former Communists out of office.
   The opposition, and many of its Western supporters, seemed
convinced it would win June elections.
   When the Socialists won, the opposition formally accepted the
result, but has seemed unable to live with it since.
   Street demonstrations got under way almost immediately, with
students around the country occupying universities to force the
resignation of Socialist President Petar Mladenov.
   Mladenov bowed to the pressure in early July. Then it took three
weeks of Byzantine political wrangling to get Zhelyu Zhelev,
formerly the opposition leader, appointed president.
   Lukanov, seen by observers as one of the few capable politicians
in Bulgaria, was widely credited with persuading the Socialists to
accept Zhelev.
   But the opposition never came through with the tacitly implied
second part of the deal: agreement to join the former Communists in
Lukanov's government.
   Backed by some Western diplomats, the opposition apparently felt
the Socialists were a spent political force bound to disintegrate.
   For his part, Lukanov refused to break with the Socialist Party,
arguing that it stood for his social democratic ideals.
   Lukanov eventually appointed an all-Socialist government but
continued to battle for broad support, arguing this was vital to a
vague but sweeping program of economic reform.
   Meanwhile, the economy and society slid into chaos. Electricity
and food rationing began in Sofia and other cities in September.
Stores have grown barer since. Power is now shut off two hours in
every four in the capital.
   The worst outburst of violence came in late August, when an
angry crowd invaded Socialist Party headquarters, burning and
pillaging several offices.
   Last week, the opposition took the decisive step of walking out
of Parliament. A general strike by the main opposition union this
week proved the final blow to the Socialist government.
   Although the political parties are said to have agreed on a
transition government until new elections are held in May, there is
virtually no evidence of political unity.
   The Socialist Party draws on 100 years of tradition and is even
older than the Soviet Communist movement, but remains severely
split.
   The unwieldy opposition coalition of 16 parties also is deeply
divided, and boasts few figures of Lukanov's caliber.
   On Friday, Sofia returned to its bitter reality. The shoppers
glumly queuing for food know the new government is unlikely to make
life much better.
   ``Even though I am stepping down, my economic and social program
has no alternative,'' Lukanov told the Grand National Assembly in
his farewell speech Friday.
   In his last weeks before resigning, Lukanov pushed for radical
market-oriented reforms including an austerity budget that would
jack up many state-controlled prices, close down unprofitable firms
and introduce guarantees for foreign investments.
   If Bulgaria does not carry out radical reforms soon, it could
find itself lagging far behind ``the European train'' of change,
Lukanov told reporters.
   ``I'm afraid we have already missed the train,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   A top-level German court on Friday upheld the
acquittal of a former Nazi Gestapo chief accused ff complicity in
the murder of French Jews sent to the Auschwitz death camp.
   Count Modest von Korff, now 81, had been accused of ordering the
deportations of Jews from the Chalons-sur-Marne region of
northeastern France, where he served as the Nazi Gestapo chief in
1942 and 1943. He was accused in the deaths of 177 deportees.
   The Karlsruhe-based Federal Court of Justice said it had
reviewed the evidence and could not find any legal errors.
   Korff's case had attracted international attention, and Nazi
hunter Serge Klarsfeld was among the spectators when a trial court
acquitted the Gestapo boss two years ago in Bonn.
   During his trial, Korff claimed he did not know about the
extermination of Jews when he served as the secret police boss.
   The Nazis killed millions, including an estimated 6 million
Jews, between 1933 and 1945. Auschwitz, located in modern-day
Poland, was the most infamous of the Nazi concentration camps set
up by Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Klarsfeld, the French Nazi hunter, had led prosecutors to Korff,
who had held a rank equivalent to captain during the war.
   The defendant served as an adviser to the West German Economics
Ministry until his retirement in the early 1970s. He lives in the
the Bonn suburb of Koenigswinter.
   About 20 relatives of the victims joined Klarsfeld in the
courtroom when the verdict was delivered in November 1988.
   Some of them cried out ``this is a Nazi court!'' and ``Nazi
murderer!'' when Judge Martin Lickfett read out the acquittal. It
was based on a finding that Korff did not know the reason for the
deportations and therefore was not guilty of the murder-relatd
charges.
   However, the victims' families had argued that Korff's assertion
that he thought the Jewish deportees were only being sent to work
details was simply not credible.
   To back up that claim, they told the court that Korff had also
deported children who were too young to be part of any work crews.

<HEAD>Commerce Department Figures Indicate Recession Has Arrived</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's economic forecasting gauge on
Friday belatedly signaled the likelihood of a recession that most
economists believe already has begun.
   The Commerce Department reported its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators plunged 1.2 percent in October on top of three previous
monthly declines including July when the index was first reported
to have been flat.
   Three consecutive declines in the index have been viewed as a
fairly reliable - although not infallible - sign that a recession
is approaching.
   President Bush, speaking at a news conference, confirmed the bad
news and attributed at least part of the economic weakness to the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent disruption of world oil
supplies.
   ``Our economy, as I said the other day, is at best in a serious
slowdown. And if uncertainty remains in the energy makets, the
slowdown will get worse.''
   Elliott Platt, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, a
New York securities dealer, said the leading indicators ``should
remove any lingering doubts about whether the economy is in a
recession,''
   Economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. said the report was
``another reminder that the economy is unravelling and sliding into
a recession.''
   The gauge is designed to forecast economic conditions six to
nine months in advance. However, recent surveys show that most
economists believe the economy already was in a downturn.
   ``It looks like the leading indicators are catching up with the
economy,'' said economist Robert G. Dederick of the Northern Trust
Co. in Chicago. ``The basic message is that we are in a recession''
and that the economy will continue to decline.
   William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, agreed.
   ``Instead of foretelling a recession that is a few months away,
those indicators show that it already has started'' and ``suggest
that the economy will get even worse before recovering,'' he said.
   Many analysts had expected the October decline. But the
department surprised some observers by revising the July index,
which originally was said to be unchanged, to a 0.1 percent
decline.
   The gauge dropped 0.8 percent in September and 1.2 percent in
August, the steepest decline since a 1.4 percent plunge in the
month following the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Eight of the 11 forward-looking components were negative in
October - consumer confidence fell for the third straight month,
weekly unemployment claims rose for the fifth month, the average
workweek shortened and building permits declined for the fourth
month.
   At the same time, the money supply shrunk for the sixth month,
stock prices were off for the fourth month, the price of raw
materials dropped, meaning less demand, and business deliveries
sped up indicating fewer orders.
   The only positive contributors were increases in orders for
consumer goods and for new plants and equipment and in unfilled
orders.
   Nevertheless, Dederick found a ``silver lining'' in the positive
contributions. He said they suggested that businesses apparently
were not cutting back dramatically which would indicate a
relatively mild downturn.
   Platt also predicted the recession would be mild, saying the
gross national product would decline no more than 1 percent before
the recession ended next summer. Sinai said it could end by spring.
   MacReynolds, on the other hand, said the overall economy is
falling rapidly on the heels of declines in the housing and
construction industries and poor performance in the industrial
sector.
   ``Predictions that the recession will be short-lived are based
more on wishful thinking than sound economic analysis,'' he said.
   A recession generally is defined as two consecutive declines in
the GNP - the total output of the nation's goods and services.
   The various changes left the index at 141.6 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and down 1.9 percent from its level a year ago. The
index has fallen during six of the 10 months so far this year.
   There has not been a recession since World War II without the
index turning down for at least three consecutive months.
   On the other hand, the gauge was negative for six months in 1984
and again for four months following the 1987 crash. Both times, the
economy escaped a recession.

<HEAD>Student Says Coaches Threatened To Hang, Shoot Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW WAVERLY, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-year-old student said two high
school football coaches trying to persuade him to improve his
grades threatened to hang him, shoot him and tie him up.
   The coaches were suspended with pay after the boy's mother filed
a complain  with the sheriff's department and the justice of the
peace, school board president Alton Adams said Thursday.
   Sheriff's officials said they were investigating the allegations
against New Waverly High School's second-year coach Larry Spacek
and assistant coach Steve Ramsey, in his first year.
   New Waverly Middle School student Josh Clark said he was in the
high school gymnasium Tuesday when the coaches asked to see him
about the possibility of him playing football next year when he's
supposed to enter high school.
   ``Coach Spacek got to talking with me about my grades and then
Coach Ramsey said he was tired of me,'' Josh said.
   He said Spacek threatened to tie him up with an extension cord
and hang him from the ceiling.
   Then Ramsey went ouside to his truck saying he had something
better, Josh said. He returned with the starter's pistol - which
Josh said he thought was a real gun. Starter's pistols fire blanks.
   ``I was hollering,'' Josh said. ``I thought he was going to
shoot me, but Coach Spacek told him not to.''
   Ramsey said his attorney told him not to comment and Spacek
would only say he had hired an attorney.
   Thea Clark, Josh's mother, said her son had nightmares Tuesday
night and has refused to go to school since the incident. She said
the coaches told her they were ``just playing around'' and meant no
harm to her son.
   ``I don't care if it was just a starter gun,'' she said. ``You
don't play with a kid that way.''
   School Superintendent Alvin Davis would only say Spacek and
Ramsey were disciplined. Davis said the school board would consider
the matter at its next meeting.

<HEAD>Women Say Going To Iraq Only Way To Rescue Husbands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two women who are traveling to Iraq against
the U.S. government's advice said Friday their trip is the only way
they will secure their husbands' freedom.
   ``We're caught in the middle,'' said Barbara Smiley of Los
Angeles. ``The U.S. government says we are interfering in foreign
policy. But what is the foreign policy?'' she said in an interview.
   The women are part of a larger group of more than a dozen
intending to fly from New York to Jordan on Monday before going to
Iraq. Saddam has invited the families of hostages to travel to
Iraq.
   Mrs. Smiley and Kim Edwards of Carson City, Nevada, said they
have ignored the State Department's warnings about traveling to
Iraq because they are confident their trip will achieve their
objective: their husbands.
   ``This is the only way we are going to get them,'' Mrs. Smiley
said. ``Saddam has said those who come without guns will not leave
empty-handed.''
   Her husband, Edward, 42, had been in Kuwait on a new job for
three days when Saddam invaded on Aug. 2. Smiley, who was working
as a database manager for a Kuwaiti company, has been held as a
``human shield'' at an undisclosed place in Iraq.
   She and the others opted to visit Iraq because they feel the
State Department is not working hard enough to free the hostages.
   Aside from losing his glasses, Mrs. Smiley said her husband was
faring alright in captivity. But he wants his freedom.
   At a news conference Friday, President Bush said he was ``deeply
concerned'' about the roughly 1,000 hostages in Kuwait and Iraq.
   He condemned Saddam for ``cynical and brutal policy'' in
inviting families to see their loved ones. Iraq is ``forcing people
to beg for their (the hostages) release, parceling out human lives
to families and traveling emissaries like so much chattel,'' he
said.
   Bush also said he is dispatching Secretary of State James Baker
III to Baghdad to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis with an
eye toward resolving it peacefully.
   ``I am so sure he is coming out,'' Mrs. Edwards said of her
husband, Tony. She said her 52-year-old husband, Tony, a planner
with a Japanese firm, was trapped in Baghdad at the time of the
invasion.
   While some members of the group intend to stay for only two
weeks, Mrs. Edwards said her plans are to remain in Iraq, where she
had lived previously with her husband, until he is released.
   The State Department has repeatedly urged American families not
to go to Iraq. U.S. officials say the families are being used as
pawns in Iraq's propaganda war and they cannot guarantee their
security.
   Nevertheless, three Americans were released this week after
their relatives traveled to Iraq to personally appeal to Saddam
Hussein. Boxer Mohammed Ali is now in Iraq and said he will return
to the United States with 14 hostages. The State Department said it
could not confirm the figure.
   Coming Home, a group formed in Champaign, Ill., by businessman
Michael Saba, helped coordinate the visit. Saba fled from Iraq in a
taxi on Aug. 9.

<HEAD>Bush to Pursue Diplomacy, But Embraces Force Resolution</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts one graf after 11th graf, `` - Disputed critics ...,''

   President Bush announced today he was sending
Secretary of State James Baker III to Iraq, but blended the
last-ditch diplomatic overture with a stern warning to Saddam
Hussein that there would ``not be any murky ending'' if war breaks
out in the Middle East.
   Bush welcomed a United Nations resolution that would allow for
the use of force after Jan. 15 if Iraq has not withdrawn its troops
from Kuwait. ``I don't think there has ever been a question that
the United States is going to blink'' in this situation, he said.
   In televised remarks from the White House, Bush said he hoped
that Saddam would receive Baker ``at a mutually convenient time''
between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15. He also invited Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz to Washington for consultations during the week of Dec.
10.
   Shortly after Bush's remarks, the Iraqi embassy said it had no
reaction from Baghdad to Bush's surprise diplomatic move. However,
Iraqi Ambassador to France Abdul Razzack al Hashimi told BBC radio
in London: ``This is a very important step, really, toward peace,
and we hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for,
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war ... I consider it
very good news.''
   But he added, ``We are not accepting pre-condition
negoatiations. Let's wait and see, and let's be optimistic, and see
what Mr. Baker has in mind.''
   Bush said Baker's trip would underscore for Saddam America's
determination. ``The best way to get that across is one on one,
Baker looking him in the eye. It isn't a trip of concession.'' The
United States is increasing its troop commitment in the Gulf to
more than 400,000.
   He said Baker would be prepared ``to discuss all aspects of the
gulf crisis,'' but said the United States would not waiver in his
objectives of total Iraqi withdrawal, restoration of the Kuwaiti
government and release of all hostages.
   In his speech and news conference afterwards, Bush also:
   - Disclosed that Iraqis have recently appeared unexpectedly at
the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait with deliveries of cigarettes,
fruits and vegetables. He said he understood there was another
delivery on Saturday including soda pop.
   - Said he would not summon Congress into special session to
debate the Persian Gulf crisis. He said he would not object to one,
but the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate have shown
little interest in reconvening. Bush said he wanted to see Congress
pass a resolution enthusiastically endorsing the U.N. vote.
   - Disputed critics who have minimized the potential Iraqi
nuclear threat. He said Sen. Al Gore might not be concerned about
it, ``but I am not going to err on the side of underestimation.''
   In New York, oil prices tumbled more than $3 a barrel to just
below $30 in the first hours after Bush spoke, including a drop of
more than $1 a barrel in a span of several minutes while Bush
appered on television. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was
up nearly 40 points at 2 p.m. EST.
   Bush acknowledged some American misgivings about the prospects
of war and vowed that if hostilities erupt: ``This will not be
another Vietnam. This will not be a protracted, drawn out war.'' He
said he saw no need for an American military draft.
   He said allied forces ``will have the power to get the job
done,'' if prompted to confront the Iraqi military.
   Bush's speech and news conference came against a backdrop of
rising criticism of his policy. He announced three weeks ago a
further buildup of the 230,000 American troops already in the
region. A roster of former government officials told Senate
hearings this week the president should exercise caution and give
ecionomic sanctions a chance to work befoire committing the United
States to military action.
   A prominent congressional Republican, Rep. William Broomfield of
Michigan, said the diplomatic avenue would provide ``wiggle room''
for Saddam, and said, ``Anything the president can do to keep the
focus of the crisis on diplomacy and not on war is all to the
good.''
   Bush said there could no compromise on his demands that Iraq
withdraw completely, restore the Kuwaiti government to power and
release all hostages being held in the crisis.
   He hailed the U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force if
Iraq doesn't withdraw by Jan. 15, and pointedly observed that
economic sanctions alone might not be sufficient to force Saddam to
withdraw his troops.
   If hostilities break out, he said, allied troops ``will have the
power to get the job done.''
   Speaking of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, Bush said, ``I am
hopeful that now he will realize he must leave Kuwait
immediately.''
   At the same time, he stressed that he has no optimism that
Baker's mission will have any ``big results.'' Instead, he said the
overture demonstrated his desire to ``go the extra mile'' for a
peaceful settlement of the crisis.
   ``Never has there been a clearer demonstration of a world united
against appeasement and aggression,'' the president said, referring
to a mulititude of U.N. resolutions demanding Iraq's withdrawal.
   Said Bush: ``I remain hopeful we can achieve a peaceful solution
to this crisis. But if force is required ... we have enough power
to get the job done.''
   He cautioned Iraq not to misread his motives in pursuing the
diplomatic approach. ``I don't think there has ever been a question
that the United States is going to blink'' in this situation, he
said.
   Bush's comments appeared designed in part to raise the military
stakes with Saddam, but also to respond to critics in Congress who
have said he should exercise patience and diplomacy. Allies,
especially the Soviet Union and China, have pointedly emphasized
the diplomatic approach.
   He said there is talk of Saddam of not fully understanding his
determination to see that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait. He said he
wants to see the U.N. resolutions ``implemented to a T.''
   That means Iraqi withdrawl from Kuwait, restoration of the
Kuwaiti government and release of all hostages beind held in
Kuwait, including those used as human shields to discourage
military strikes against vital installations.
   Bush was asked about the potential toll of human lives in a Gulf
war.
   He sighed and said he knew many people wondered, ``How many
lives is it worth? ... I will do my level best to bring those kids
home without one single shot being fired in anger.''
   Bush said, ``those who see no downside to waiting months and
months'' must consider ``the damage being done every day'' to the
fragile economies of the countries in the region.

   Madonna was excused from appearing Friday in
court, where a neighbor is suing to force the entertainer to trim
her trees and hedges.
   Superior Court Judge Sally Disco said a deposition Madonna gave
earlier could be used instead of testimony after her lawyers said
she had received various threats. They did not elabortte.
   Donald Robinson, Madonna's neighbor in the Hollywood Hills, said
she violated a written agreement to keep her hedges and trees
trimmed so they wouldn't interfere with the view from Robinson's
multimillion-dollar mansion.
   He said she planted more trees and totally obscured his view of
the city.
   ``My intention was to protect my property value, my view and to
enjoy my home,'' said Robinson, a real estate broker.
   ``I'm seeking damages for the loss of value to my home,'' he
said. He estimated that loss at $1 million.
   Madonna's lawyer, Meghan Serwin, said the star has complied with
the agreement and claims Robinson allowed his guests to peer
through the hedges to spy on her.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actor Lorenzo Lamas of television's ``Falcon
Crest'' was punched in the face when he tried to break up a fight
at a movie theater, authorities said.
   Lamas, 32, sustained a small cut on his forehead in the Thursday
night scuffle at the Cineplex Odeon in suburban Universal City,
said Los Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom.
   Lamas and his wife, actress Kathleen Kinmont, were watching a
movie at the theater when two men sitting in front of them began
fighting, Hom said. Lamas tried to break up the fight, but the men
turned on him.
   Lamas was taken to St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, where
he was treated and released, Hom said.
   Hom said he didn't know what started the fight, adding that the
men, who apparently were friends, were both booked for
investigation of battery and each released on $250 bail.
   Lamas is the son of the late actor Fernando Lamas and actress
Arlene Dahl. He portrayed Lance Cumson, the playboy heir to a
winery empire on the long-running CBS-TV series ``Falcon Crest.''

   INTERNATIONAL FALLS, Minn. (AP) - Four bar patrons in this
Canadian border city helped David Letterman make a recent episode
of his New York City-based television show international.
   Letterman, host of NBC-TV's ``Late Night With David Letterman,''
called the Outpost bar to find someone to make the short drive over
the border into Canada and call him at his studio. He gave
bartender Laurie Hansen the number and hung up.
   ``Anybody want to call David Letterman?'' she yelled to the few
customers in the bar late Tuesday afternoon.
   There were a few guffaws, but she convinced a party of four to
drive the mile to the border, where Jerry Vohler called Letterman
from a Canadian customs office just before the show's taping ended.
   Hansen said she thought the call was a joke at first, but she
could hear the audience laughing and had seen the show enough times
to know that it would be like Letterman to arrange such a stunt.
   The show was broadcast early Wednesday morning.

<HEAD>Solider Refusing Middle East Deployment Faces Court Martial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT RILEY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military officials have recommended a
court-martial for a soldier who refused to go to the Persian Gulf,
saying he believed ``with all my heart, war is wrong.''
   Sgt. George Morse, 25, was charged with refusing orders to
prepare equipment for transport to Saudi Arabia.
   Army officials on Thursday recommended the court-martial for
Morse, who plays trumpet in the 1st Infantry Division band. He was
to have been assigned to division headquarters as a military police
officer, said Mike Zucca, Fort Riley spokesman.
   ``We have not had a chance to talk to our client and formulate
what our next action is,'' said Joanne Brooke, an assistant to
Morse's attorney, Robert Littrell.
   Morse, a six-year veteran, was confined to the post Wednesday
after the charges were filed, Ms. Brooke said. He has been assigned
a military defense lawyer, but has retained Littrell.
   President Bush has sent 430,000 troops to the Persian Gulf
following Iraq's invasion of oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2. The United
Nations Security ouncil voted 12-2 Thursday to allow force to be
used if Iraq doesn't withdraw by Jan. 15.
   ``I now believe with all my heart, war is wrong,'' Morse wrote
in his Nov. 23 request for conscientious objector status. ``Not
just in the Middle East, but in any case. I cannot have any part in
the senseless killing of war.''
   ``I will not participate in a war effort or a military effort,
no matter if it has started yet, or not,'' Morse said earlier this
week.
   Morse, of Grayling, Mich., was scheduled to be discharged Dec.
20. The Army denied his application for conscientious objector
status on Saturday. The 1st Infantry was activated Nov. 8. He was
reassigned to a unit not being sent to the Middle East.
   His case is similar to others that have resulted from the troop
deployment.
   In Albuquerque, N.M., a soldier who sought conscientious
objector status was demoted last week and confined to his barracks
for refusing an order to bear arms during training.
   Earlier this month, Illinois Army reservist, Spc. Stephanie
Atkinson, was discharged in Louisville, Ky., and excused from duty
in the Persian Gulf after saying she was a conscientious objector.
   In Hawaii, the Marine Corps has rejected Cpl. Jeffery Paterson's
application for concientious objector status. His court-martial has
been scheduled for Dec. 3.
   If the Fort Riley commander accepts the recommendation for a
court-martial, Morse can choose a trial by jury or military judge,
Ms. Brooke said. Maximum punishment could include a term in the
Army Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth and a dishonorable
discharge.

<TEXT>
   President Bush met today with Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, here for the first time since China's
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, and said they hoped to
reduce differences between the two countries.
   With Qian at his side as they posed for photographers, Bush
acknowledged that he has ``some differences'' with China on human
rights but added that there are ``many positive and very important
aspects'' to the relationship.
   ``One purpose of this kind of meeting is to reduce the
differences,'' Bush said.
   Bush and Qian met after prolonged confusion over whether the
meeting actually would take place. The State Department announced
the meeting, then issued a revised schedule suggesting it had been
canceled. But the meeting was held after Qian met for more than two
hours with Secretary of State James A. Baker.
   Qian made the visit amid signs of new strains in Sino-American
relations.
   Chinese officials had led the Bush administration to believe
that Qian would support the U.S.-backed resolution approved
Thursday in the U.N. Security Council. The resolution authorizes
the use of force against Iraq.
   But Qian opted instead to abstain, causing surprise and
disappointment at the State Department.
   Qian revealed he was not prepared to support the resolution as
he was leaving Beijing for New York. He left the impression among
some that his government was annoyed with speculation that the
United States was inviting Qian to Washington to reward him for
China's support in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Hours before the vote, the Chinese Foreign Ministry denied there
was any link between China's stand on the resolution and Qian's
invitation to visit Washington.
   Baker had wanted as lopsided a vote as possible to send a clear
signal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of international resolve
on the gulf situation. China had supported all 10 previous Security
Council resolutions on that issue. Excluding China's vote, the
tally Thursday was 12-2 in support of the resolution.
   There also are clear signs that human rights questions continue
to be a sore point between the two countries since the crackdown on
demonstrators in China a year and a half ago.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said in Beijing, ``It is
not appropriate to interfere in some developing countries' internal
affairs with an excuse of human rights.''
   The Bush administration has barred high-level exchanges with
China as a show of displeasure over its crackdown on demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
   It has said Qian's visit does not violate that policy because
his discussions in Washington are regarded as ``contacts,'' which
are permitted. Meetings in the category of ``large ceremonial
exchanges'' are barred.
   The State Department has noted that Baker has met on a number of
previous occasions with Qian since the events at Tiananmen Square.
Three of the meetings were in New York and the others were in Paris
and Cairo.

   ``What do you make from flour?'' the teacher at
Children's Boarding School No. 24 asked her two dozen pupils on
Friday, hoisting a kilogram sack from the first shipment of Western
food aid to arrive in Moscow.
   ``Blini!'' they chorused, smiling at the prospect of sweet
Russian pancakes for dinner.
   ``And what do you say?'' their teacher continued.
   ``Thank you!'' they responded.
   As the first planeload of donated food from Germany was
distributed to orphanages and children's hospitals, the generosity
spread in other Western nations. Vienna promised 100,000 food
parcels for Moscow children, and organizations in the United
States, Italy and the Nordic countries prepared shipments of milk,
flour, canned goods and other staples.
   In Leningrad, Pravda reported, ambulances have been collecting
victims of fainting from hunger, heart attacks and broken ribs from
the lines outside shops.
   The price of carrots doubled as citizens braced for Saturday's
start of Leningrad's first rationing program since World War II.
Then, it was besieged by Nazi forces for 900 days and hundreds of
thousands died, many from hunger.
   The Moscow newspaper Vechernaya Moskva printed a plaintive
appeal from a caller on Friday. ``My child is crying with hunger.
Where can I buy just a little butter, cereal and eggs?'' a parent
asked.
   At Children's Hospital No. 3 in Moscow, warehouse clerk Yulia
Bodganova gratefully received a German gift of beans, chicken soup
and flour - even though the hospital has been better supplied than
the city at large.
   It was only this week that its food supplier warned that the
young patients could no longer be spared the shortages.
   ``We've received no sour cream or cottage cheese for three
days,'' she said. By Friday, the usual deliveries of cheese and
eggs also had evaporated.
   A few blocks away, engineer Kim Melkonian was the 170th person
in a line for butter in the gathering dusk at 4 p.m. Calculating
one minute per customer, he figured he would be waiting three hours
in the darkened street before even entering the store.
   He blamed the shortages on sabotage by bureaucrats struggling to
hold onto their power in the face of growing democracy.
   Soviet officials have said the country has produced no less food
this year than last, despite the barren shelves that have panicked
shoppers into hoarding and exacerbating the shortages.
   But Western governments are worried that frightened consumers
could destabilize the government of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has made aid to the Soviets a top
item on his international agenda, arguing that without a stable
Soviet Union, reforms in eastern Europe could be endangered.
   ``We need the Western aid,'' Melkonian said. ``There is enough
food, but people are afraid. We have to calm them down.''
   ``When Gorbachev came to power, people said, `Mikhail
Sergeyevich, we can do without butter, just as long as there is no
war.' Now, there's no longer any danger of war, and everyone is
saying, `Give us bread,''' Melkonian said.
   ``We do have wheat and bread in this country, we do have the
necessary food, but where is it?'' asked Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov
at a briefing Friday. ``It's hidden by the state-owned farms,
collective farms. Which ones? The best ones, because the worst ones
do not have anything.''
   ``They understand (that) when the land will be privatized there
will be no place for them,'' he said.
   Several republics and regions have cut off shipments of food
beyond their borders, leaving major cities like Moscow with
diminished supplies of milk and meat - which have never been
plentiful.
   Many farmers have stopped selling their crops through state
stores at low official prices and switched to private farmers'
markets, where prices are often 10 times as high.
   Theft is also rising, prompting the national parliament to order
the KGB to protect incoming shipments of humanitarian aid. On
Friday, the secretive police agency said it was forming a special
unit for the task.
   Popov said Muscovites will soon be given passes allowing them to
purchase goods in specific stores at specific times, to help people
who complain that the shelves are empty when they get off work.
Permits will specify the store, date, time and amount of money an
individual can spend.
   Vienna Mayor Helmut Zilk, who announced his city's $2-million
aid program at the news conference in Moscow with Popov, said this
food ``should be given to the retirees, to the most vulnerable
groups of people, the people who went through the war.''
   ``After the second world war, all the allies helped us ... so we
must now help you,'' Zilk said.

<HEAD>Court Says Department Must Bargain With Unions Over Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government department that is leading the
federal fight against cigarette smoking was ordered Friday to
bargain with unionized employees over whether they may puff away on
the job.
   The Department of Health and Human Services, which in 1987
banned smoking by its 118,000 employees in all of the agency's
offices nationwide, was ordered by the court to bargain with three
union locals whose members want a place to smoke.
   A Federal Labor Relations Authority order that HHS bargain with
the three union locals was unanimously upheld in the decision by a
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia.
   There was no immediate comment from HHS.
   But union attorney David F. Klein said the decision upholds an
important principle that federal agencies must bargain with
employees over working conditions unless they have a compelling
reason not to negotiate.
   HHS's ``compelling reason not to was to set an example for the
general public and the court didn't buy that,'' Klein said.
   He said the decision will serve as a precedent for any other
union locals that wish to challenge the HHS smoking ban.
   After HHS promulgated the no-smoking rules in 1987, the three
local chapters of the National Treasury Employees Union sought to
bargain over what the union argued was a change in working
conditions.
   The locals, representing employees at the agency's Washington
headquarters, the Family Support Administration, and the Kansas
City regional office, proposed setting up designated smoking areas
similar to those in other government agencies.
   But HHS, said it was not compelled to bargain with the union
because the smoking ban was a crucialpart of its mission to
persuade private companies to create smoke-free environments for
all workers.
   The agency cited a 1986 report by the U.S. surgeon general about
the health risks to non-smoking employees who breath the cigarette
smoke of co-workers.
   ``Nothing less than a policy of a smoke-free environment can
assure adequate protection of the occupants in
department-controlled building space,'' HHS said at the time.
   But the appeals court noted a government-wide regulation
promulgated by the General Services Administration allows smoking
in designated areas ``and also recognizes the collective bargaining
obligations of government agencies on the question.''
   HHS's ``health-based argument is consequently a collateral
attack on the government-wide GSA regulation'' which, the court
noted, ``requires that agencies accommodate the needs of smokers
where feasible.''
   The court didn't dispute what it recognized as the agency's
legitimate concern for the health of employees.
   ``It is hard to see how it can be argued, however, that HHS's
concern for its employees can be qualitatively different from that
of other government agencies,'' the court said in an opinion by
Circuit Judge Laurence Silberman.
   The court upheld the federal labor panel's determination that
HHS had failed to prove a ``compelling need'' to declare its
smoking rules off-limits to collective bargaining.

   President Bush says he'd ``love to see''
Congress formally back the U.N. resolution authorizing force
against Iraq, but some on Capitol Hill say the lawmakers are much
less receptive than the diplomats.
   In any case, Bush said Friday he has no plans to call Congress
into special session to address the issue. And his announcement
that he'll send Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a
diplomatic mission to Baghdad seemed to make congressional action
in the meantime all the less likely.
   If Congress were to take on the issue soon, said House Speaker
Thomas Foley, ``obviously, it's very difficult to tell what the
response would be.''
   ``Congress could amend it, put conditions on it, pass it by a
narrow margin, or defeat it by a narrow margin. That's a matter the
president will have to consider, said Foley, D-Wash.
   Still, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, renewing his call for
a special session, said there would be bipartisan backing for a
resolution of support if it could be brought to a vote.
   Bush went on television declaring a willingness to ``go the
extra mile'' in the quest for peace. He offered to swap high-level
visits with Iraq, and was meeting later with senior members of
Congress to consult on his gulf policy.
   One senior Democratic aide said it would be ``pointless'' to
hold a formal debate until after Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz hold talks in each others capitals between now and Jan.
15.
   Some leading Republicans on Capitol Hill have suggested that
Bush quickly seek ratification by Congress of the resolution
approved by the United Nations Security Council on Thursday,
authorizing military action to liberate Kuwait if Iraq does not
withdraw by Jan. 15.
   Such a move, they say, would demonstrate to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that the United States was united and determined
that his aggression against Kuwait would not be rewarded. They want
Bush to act while his international momentum is high.
   ``I'd love to see Congress pass a resolution enthusiastically
endorsing what the United Nations has done,'' Bush said at a White
House news conference.
   ``What I don't want to do is have it come back and end up where
you have 435 voices in one house and 100 in the other, saying what
NOT to do,'' he said, adding that he hopes to avoid a
``hand-wringing operation that would send bad signals.''
   ``I know my strengths, and I know the limitations on the
presidency,'' Bush said.
   Democrats in Congress, and some Republicans, are saying the
president should not take support for granted. All week, Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., has paraded former military officials before his Armed
Services Committee criticizing Bush's gulf policy.
   Congressional critics say Bush still has not provided a coherent
rationale for the latest escalation in U.S. troop deployment and
for the apparent shift to an offensive stance that it signals.
   ``At this point I would not support it,'' Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., said of a possible resolution, speaking in advance of the
president's speech.
   ``We could see an extraordinarily messy situation created by a
congressional vote,'' one which portrays not the unity that Bush
seeks, but division, he said. ``He must go and sell the American
public as to why it's necessary.''
   And Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan, the senior Republican
on the Foreign Affairs Committee, cautioned Bush to wait to develop
a better consensus before asking Congress to rule on his policy.
   At its core, the problem is relatively simple: How does Congress
help Bush amplify his threats to use force against Iraq in the hope
of forcing Saddam to back down, without at the same time giving up
its right to decide whether ultimately to go to war?
   Many lawmakers fear that they would, in voting for a resolution
approving military action, be giving Bush a blank check for
whatever moves he may choose.
   An endorsement by Congress would not be simply a vote of
confidence in the same manner as the U.N. resolution, said House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``It ups the ante,'' he
said. ``Then you have changed the policy and force can happen.''
   Gephardt welcomed Bush's moves Friday as a use of the U.N. vote
to give new life to diplomacy. ``There is broad support in this
country for moving in this direction, and Saddam Hussein should
know that America is united in our determination to see him end his
brutal occupation,'' Gephardt said.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., suggested that Congress could
pass a resolution that puts on the record what many Democrats have
been saying all week at Senate hearings on the gulf crisis: that
economic sanctions should be allowed time to work, even if it takes
a year or more.
   ``Going to war now or in the next few months would be a mistake
that could cost the lives of thousands of Americans for no
justifiable reason,'' Kennedy said.
   But if there are risks for Bush, there are risks for Congress as
well in seeking to fence the president's actions.
   ``How can you vote against a resolution if you've got your boys
on the front line shooting or being shot at?'' said Rep. Joseph
Moakley, D-Mass. ``We should be brought into the situation'' before
that, he said.

<HEAD>World Almanac Says Symington is Governor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Almanac appears to have jumped the gun
regarding the outcome of Arizona's gubernatorial election.
   According to The 1991 World Almanac and Book of Facts, Fife
Symington is the new governor.
   However, after the Nov. 6 general election votes were counted,
neither Republican Symington nor his Democratic opponent, Terry
Goddard, received a majority and a runoff election was declared for
Feb. 26.
   Two million copies of the almanac are hitting the bookstore
shelves this week containing the wrong information.
   ``We go to press practically as soon as the results are in on
Election Day night,'' said Martha Clarke, publicity manager for
Pharos Books, a subsidiary of Scripps Howard, which has published
the almanac since 1986.
   ``The governors of the states, except in your case, apparently,
are correct,'' Ms. Clarke said. ``Literally, the editor in chief is
writing down the results on his way to the printing press.''
   Although there is no mention of a runoff, a section titled ``The
Race for Governor: 1990'' mentions that the results are
``preliminary.''
   The almanac shows Symington with 519,558 votes to Goddard's
515,999.
   After all precincts were counted, official election results show
Symington with 523,984 to Goddard's 519,691 votes out of more than
1.09 million votes cast.
   ``They got it wrong and they'll have to change it in February,''
Goddard said. ``They'll have to buy a lot of white-out.''
   Symington, who has referred to the runoff campaign as a
``re-election'' bid, said, ``I think it's very amusing, and
hopefully, it's a good omen,'' he said.

   The soldiers who shared
Thanksgiving dinner with President Bush said Friday they welcomed
the ultimatum set by the U.N. Security Council as the only way to
get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.
   ``He better let the hostages go and he better leave, or we're
coming to get him,'' said Sgt. William R. Blocker, 7, of
Sylacauga, Ala., who chatted with Barbara Bush as he ate his turkey
and trimmings.
   A week after their commander-in-chief told them he would not let
Saddam remain in Kuwait indefinitely, soldiers from the 197th
Infantry Brigade gathered in their dusty desert camp to voice
support for his latest success at the United Nations.
   Several said the resolution authorizing the use of force if Iraq
fails to leave conquered Kuwait by Jan. 15 should have been adopted
months ago. It was passed Thursday.
   ``I think it's about 90 days too late, but I can live with Jan.
15,'' said Sgt. Mark Channer, 25, of New York City, who was Mrs.
Bush's escort.
   His advice to Saddam: ``Pack up and move out quick.''
   Sgt. James Landreth, 29, of New Boston, Ohio, who ate turkey
with Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, echoed Channer saying, ``it
should have happened a while back. As we got here, they should
already have figured that out.''
   For months, Blocker said, the troops have ``been in limbo'' not
knowing if they were going to stay here or go home.
   ``Now we know we're going to be here 'til the end - 'til he
either leaves or we force him out. It's a good relief to hear
something like that because basically they opened the door and let
us out of the dark and they let us know what was going on,''
Blocker said.
   Cpl. Thomas Cook, 32, of Granite City, Ill., like the rest of
the brigade has spent three months in a desolate patch of desert,
about an hour's ride from the nearest paved highway in a four-wheel
drive vehicle down a bumpy sand trail.
   Bush wants to put an end to the stalemate, he said.
   ``We can't just sit out here and just keep yelling at each other
so somebody's got to do something,'' Cook said.
   Sgt. 1st Class Steven Campbell, 37, of Ft. Benning, Ga., where
the brigade is headquartered, said: ``It's an indication again that
we're not going to back down from Hussein. I think it needed to be
done and we did it, and the U.N. is the forum to do it.''
   ``I'd like to get home sooner to my wife and children, but I'm
not packing my bags yet,'' said the 19-year Army veteran who
introduced the president to the 1,250 soldiers and politicians at
Thanksgiving dinner.
   Spec. Robert Terry, 23, of Rehoboth Beach, Del., said Bush's
visit helped morale and the U.N. resolution would also be a boost.
   ``I think the guys out here - now that they have a positive date
that something will happen, I think that'll help 'em out,'' he
said.
   ``But truthfully, I think Hussein'll pull out before that. He's
got more brains than that,'' he said.

   The Soviet Union would not hesitate to use
military force to protect its 3,300 nationals held in Iraq,
officials said Friday, edging away from their previous refusal to
send troops to the region.
   ``Everybody should know that we will not hesitate to use force
to protect our citizens,'' Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
told the official Tass news agency.
   ``It's high time to end inaction in situations when human life,
dignity and fate become expendable currency in an immoral political
game,'' he said in an interview in New York.
   The Kremlin has said Iraq would face ``serious consequences'' if
Soviet citizens were harmed. But until now, it had not said
specifically that its response could include military force.
   Shevardnadze's tough talk came a day after President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev hardened his stand in the Persian Gulf crisis, calling
for military pressure to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Concern about Soviet citizens was also expressed by Deputy
Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky, who returned to Moscow early
Friday following a 36-hour visit to Iran, Iraq's neighbor and enemy
during their eight-year gulf war.
   ``It is obvious that we would be prepared to take the most
drastic measures to protect the life of every individual Soviet
citizen if the need arises,'' Petrovsky told a news briefing.
   Moscow sent two warships to the gulf soon after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait to protect commercial ships, but has repeatedly
maintained it would not participate in a multinational force or
naval blockade unless it were under the auspices of the United
Nations.
   The Soviet Union voted Thursday in favor of the U.N. Security
Council resolution giving Iraq a Jan. 15 deadline to withdraw from
Kuwait and release all foreign hostages or risk military action.
   Asked whether that meant the Soviet Union now was prepared to
send troops, both Shevardnadze and Petrovsky couched their answers
in terms of possible threats to Soviet citizens stranded there. The
Soviet nationals are not known to be held as human shields at
potential military targets.
   Petrovsky said a decision to dispatch troops would require
additional consultations and deliberations. He did not elaborate.
   Petrovsky also warned Iraq not to underestimate the global
determination to dislodge him from Kuwait.
   ``Iraq should not misinterpret the will of international
security and should have no doubt that the world community is ready
to act,'' he said.
   ``This choice is up to Baghdad and it will shape the action of
the world communityin the future.''
   Petrovsky said he hoped Thursday's U.N. vote ``may serve as a
serious signal to help Iraq to understand the seriousness of the
situation. I would like to hope that Iraq has not said its last
word.''

   President Bush named Florida Gov. Bob Martinez
today to run the Office of National Drug Control Policy and
designated William J. Bennett to become chairman of the Republican
National Committee.
   Bush called Martinez, defeated for re-election earlier this
month, ``a leader who's earned his stripes on the front-lines of
the drug war.''
   Bennett left office today as head of the drug policy agency
where he had served for 19 months. With Bush's endorsement, Bennett
is assured of election to the party post when the Republican
National Committee meets in January.
   Bennett will succeed Lee Atwater, who was sidelined last spring
by a malignant brain tumor.
   Bush said he was recommending that Atwater be named ``general
chairman'' of the party, a post that does not currently exist.
   ``I'm delighted that Lee Atwater will continue to provide valued
counsel as general chairman of the party,'' said the president.
``He has been, as you all know, a close adviser and political
strategist - chief political strategist - and a good friend.''
   Bennett began his government career as chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities during the Reagan administration and
then served as secretary of education.
   Martinez served one term as governor of Florida and was defeated
on Nov. 6 by former Sen. Lawton Chiles.
   Bush said that Martinez, as the National Governors'
Association's leader in fighting substance abuse, ``has been
contributing to our national drug control strategy for over two
years.''
   His new job requires Senate confirmation, and Martinez was
planning to visit with congressional leaders before returning to
Florida for the weekend.
   Bennett, a former Democrat who also was an outspoken
conservative, served as drug policy coordinator since Bush became
president.
   During his four years as governor of Florida, Martinez initiated
several high-profile anti-drug policies and even took a drug test
himself to set an example for state workers.
   Martinez also pushed through the state legislature a law
mandating the death penalty for drug kingpins in certain cases and
a measure requiring tougher penalties for drug-dealing near
schools.
   The governor is chairman of the National Governors' Association
task force on substance abuse and drug trafficking. He visited
Bolivia and Colombia in 1988 with the National Guard on a drug
fact-finding mission.

   Bulgaria will hold elections in six
months to replace Parliament, which has been dominated by former
Premier Andrei Lukanov's unpopular governing Socialist Party,
according to news reports Friday.
   The trade union newspaper Trud quoted President Zhelyu Zhelev as
saying a May date for elections was set as part of an agreement
reached between Lukanov and other political leaders prior to
Lukanov's resignation on Thursday.
   ``During these consultations it was the common opinion that the
Grand National Assembly should be retained until March,'' Zhelev
said. ``Afterward it should disband and the elections should take
place in May.''
   Legislators on Friday accepted Lukanov's resignation, which was
provoked by weeks of anti-government strikes and protests.
   There was no evidence in Sofia on Friday of the strikes
organized by the Podkrepa trade union and other widespread protests
that had disrupted the capital for weeks.
   High-placed officials said a new premier probably would be named
next week. Speaking on condition of anonymity, they said top
contenders were Ginyo Ganev, the deputy chairman of parliament, and
Krastyo Petkov, head of the main Confederation of Independent Trade
Unions.
   Speaking to Parliament, Lukanov said the agreement under which
he stepped down offered this Balkan nation of 9 million people a
chance to end its worst postwar crisis. That opportunity ``if
missed, may prove the last one,'' he said.
   ``Even though I am stepping down, my economic and social progra
has no alternative,'' Lukanov told the Grand National Assembly. In
his last week as premier, Lukanov pushed through Parliament an
austerity budget calling for steep price increases.
   The current Parliament, dominated by Lukonov's Socialist Party,
was elected in June during Bulgaria's first free elections in
decades. At the time, it was agreed the elected legislators would
serve for a minimum of one year.
   But the popularity of the Socialists has fallen steadily since
then, and the opposition coalition Union of Democratic Forces says
it would win any new elections.
   Many Bulgarians associate Lukanov, a reformed former Communist,
with four decades of communism, and tens of thousands of people
gathered Thursday night to cheer his resignation.
   But he was one of the few Bulgarian politicians with the
government experience and stature for the premiership.
   He had urged the Socialist Party under Chairman Alexander Lilov
to reform itself. But Lukanov apparently was unable to press
changes on the party or to break entirely with it, and ended up
sharing the party's unpopularity.
   A new government of largely inexperienced leaders will face
daunting problems that have grown steadily worse in months of
political inaction because of the stalemate between the Socialists
and the opposition.
   Electricity is rationed in Sofia and elsewhere. Foodstuffs and
many basic consumer items are either rationed or unavailable, and
the country cannot make payments on its $11 billion foreign debt.
   Lukanov said political leaders had agreed that a new coalition
government would be formed soon and that his successor should not
belong to his own party or the opposition alliance.
   Lukanov told a news conference that his resignation would ``not
be fatal'' for the Socialists, but said changes were needed in the
party.
   ``Now that we are not a governing party, it gives us a chance to
solve our internal problems and determine the collective and
individual responsibility within the party'' for the country's
problems, he said.
   Lukanov was one of a group of reformed Communists who helped
oust longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov last November. He was
appointed premier in early February and then presided over the
country's increasing polarization, deteriorating living standards
and growing public anger.

   The Air Force is sending more warplanes,
including at least one additional squadron of F-111 tactical
fighter-bombers, to the Persian Gulf area to expand America's
offensive air power, officials said Friday.
   Separately the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy announced
call-ups of more than 3,500 reservists from 36 states and the
District of Columbia for Operation Desert Shield.
   The total number of American reservists on active duty in Desert
Shield is now approaching 100,000, the biggest activation since the
1961 Berlin crisis.
   Capt. Betsy Well of the Air Force public affairs office at the
Pentagon said F-111s from the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at Royal
Air Force Station Lakenheath in Britain began deploying to Saudi
Arabia on Thursday. Citing security rules, she declined to say how
many planes and Air Force personnel were going.
   Ms. Well said an unspecified number of maintenance and combat
support personnel also deployed to Saudi Arabia from the 48th
Tactical Fighter Wing earlier this week.
   The Air Force sent F-111s to the Arabian Peninsula from
Lakenheath in late August and early September as part of the
initial U.S. military buildup in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait. The latest deployment is a result of President Bush's
decision, announced Nov. 8, to send large reinforcements to provide
a greater offensive capability against the Iraqi forces.
   The F-111 is a swing-wing supersonic bomber capable of carrying
either nuclear or conventional arms and able to operate from
treetop level to altitudes above 60,000 feet. F-111s from
Lakenheath were used in the U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986.
   Air Force officials said plans are under way to dispatch a
variety of other aircraft to Saudi Arabia, but they declined to
provide details. Last week the Air Force announced that an
unspecified number of OA-10 low-level observation aircraft were
being sent to the gulf from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz.
   The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified defense sources,
reported in Friday's editions that the Pentagon is sending 300 more
warplanes to the gulf to increase the total Air Force deployments
in the region to about 1,200 planes.
   The Times said the new deployments will include a second
squadron of F-117 Stealth fighter-bombers, additional F-15E
ground-attack planes, F-16 fighters, A-10 tank-killers, refueling
tankers and RF-4C photo-reconnaissance aircraft.
   The newspaper report said 27 Air Force units with about 10,000
additional personnel will be sent to the region. Some will deploy
from Europe and others will come from U.S.-based Air National Guard
and Air Force Reserve units, it said.
   Col. Joseph Purka, an Air Force spokesman, said he could not
comment on the Times report.
   In another sign that the Air Force is building up further in the
gulf, service officials announced that 89 members of the Air
National Guard were ordered to active duty.
   The Air Force reservists include 27 members of the 169th
Services Flight, 169th Tactical Fighter Group at McEntire Air
National Guard Base in South Carolina; 18 members of the 174th
Services Flight, 174th Tactical Fighter Wing at Syracuse, N.Y.; and
44 members of the 140th Security Police, 140th Tactical Fighter
Wing, Buckley Air National Guard Base in Colorado.
   The Marine Corps announced that it is ordering 2,996 reservists
to report for active duty next weekend in support of Desert Shield.
Of that total, 2,274 men from infantry and artillery units were
ordered to report Dec. 9 for duty at Camp Courtney in Okinawa,
Japan, the home station of the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force.
   The Marines said 722 reservists were ordered to report for
active duty Dec. 8. About 300 of those will go to Camp Pendleton,
Calif., with the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, and the rest will
be assigned to 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune,
N.C., ``for processing and to await further orders.''
   The Navy called up 437 reservists, mainly for medical and
intelligence support.

<HEAD>Soviet Sees Talks Within 2 Months on Short-Range Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>

   The chief Soviet negotiator at talks on
reducing conventional arms in Europe said Friday he believes new
negotiations to reduce tactical nuclear weapons on the continent
can start within two months.
   His comment was believed to be the first time an official from
either the Warsaw Pact or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
had publicly mentioned a time frame for such negotiations.
   The Kremlin has long pushed for talks on reducing short-range,
or tactical, nuclear weapons, the only nuclear arms in Europe not
so far reduced by treaty or under negotiation. Such weapons have a
range of less than 300 miles.
   The West's short-range weapons, most based in what was West
Germany, would hit targets in what are now considered friendly East
European countries.
   Until recently, the West resisted negotiating away what NATO has
viewed as a vital element in its nuclear deterrence to counter the
Warsaw Pact's massive ground forces in Eastern Europe.
   In Paris this month, the leaders of the 22 nations in NATO and
the Warsaw Pact took historic steps toward reducing the danger of a
surprise attack by those ground forces, signing an accord that
slashed tanks and other conventional arms in Europe by 100,000
units and a formal declaration of non-aggression. A second phase of
negotiations, aimed primarily at reducing the number of soldiers in
Europe, opened in Vienna Nov. 26.
   However, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev stressed at the
Paris summit that Moscow wants naval forces and tactical nuclear
weapons included either in the Vienna talks or negotiated
elsewhere.
   ``I think that, within two months, we will be in a position to
start such negotiations,'' Oleg Grinevsky, Soviet ambassador to the
Vienna arms reduction talks, told a new conference when asked about
negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons. He declined to be more
specific.
   Another Soviet negotiator, Oleg Khlestov, said: ``The situation
is only in the process of defining ideas.''
   NATO agreed last summer that talks on reducing tactical nuclear
weapons could begin ``shortly'' after the treaty signed in Paris
was wrapped up, but has not given a more specific date or place.
   Khlestov reiterated the Kremlin view that naval forces should be
included in Vienna talks, arguing that confrontation has moved to
the naval arena now that substantial reductions have been
negotiated in ground and air forces.
   The West has resisted including naval forces, saying this would
require complex global talks rather than ones confined to North
America and Europe.

   Iraq rejects the U.N. Security Council
ultimatum to withdraw from Kuwait and will fight to keep the
conquered emirate if necessary, the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council said Friday.
   The seven-man council led by President Saddam Hussein said the
U.N. resolution authorizing military force if Iraq doesn't leave
Kuwait by Jan. 15 is ``illegal, null and void'' because it was
imposed by the United States.
   ``Should the forces of evil launch aggression, this nation of
impossible missions will teach all those a hard lesson
unprecedented in history,'' the council said, one day after the
resolution was adopted by the Security Council.
   However, the Revolutionary Command Council repeated a call for
dialogue with the United States to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis
and the Palestinian question on ``the basis of equality and mutual
respect.''
   Saddam has repeatedly tried to link a resolution of the gulf
crisis with a resolution of the Palestinian uprising in Israel. The
United States has repeatedly rejected such a linkage, demanding an
unconditional withdrawal.
   On Friday President Bush unexpectedly offered to send Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad to discuss the crisis.
   In Baghdad, the Iraqi leadership was taken by surprise by Bush's
announcement about Baker and immediately went back into session to
discuss the development, diplomats said. It was not known who
attended the meeting.
   On Thursday, Saddam said Iraq would not be intimidated by the
U.N. Security Council resolution. He insisted his armed forces had
the technology to defeat sophisticated American weapons such as
stealth aircraft.
   ``The Americans are still influenced by Rambo movies but this is
not a Rambo movie. This is something different,'' he said.
   Friday's Revolutionary Command Council statement said the Iraqi
people ``reject ultimatums and threats and will never bow to
tyranny and terrorism.''
   The resolution, it said, was ``first and foremost an American
decision in which certain powers participated only under American
pressure.''
   ``The United States mobilized all its resources in an
unprecedented move to practice all forms pressure and terrorism and
pay, together with its agents, the bribes to secure the votes,''
the statement said.
   Cuba and Yemen, the only Arab member on the 15-member Security
Council, voted against the resolution on Thursday. China abstained.
   ``It is a shameful resolution, tarnished with the scandals that
have transformed the Security Council into a cover for U.S.
hegemony and a theater for its dirty deals,'' the Revolutionary
Command Council said.
   It noted that the council had failed to end Israeli occupation
of Arab territories, and because of this Arab masses would reject
the latest resolution against Iraq. ``These nations which voted to
give legitimacy to America's aggression against Iraq, made no move
to confront the Israeli aggression against Palestine,'' the
statement said.
   ``Instead, they maneuvered to slow down any effort against the
rape of Jerusalem and against the premeditated crimes committed by
the Zionist occupation forces,'' it said.
   ``The double standards these powers have become crystal clear
after the latest resolution,'' the Iraqi leaders said.

   President Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi
leaders will be tried for war crimes just as the Nazis were after
World War II, a senior U.S. official said Friday.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and the foreign ministers
of Britain, France and the Soviet Union all stressed the individual
liability of Iraq's leaders in their addresses before the U.N.
Security Council on Friday.
   A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Geneva Conventions of 1949 on the protection of civilians
and the 1925 Geneva Accords barring the use in war of chemical or
biological weapons provide the legal basis for culpability.
   Iraq is a party to both agreements.
   Kuwaiti exiles horrified the Security Council on Tuesday with
their personal accounts of torture, rape, murder, and other
atrocities perpetrated by Iraqi troops occupying Kuwait.
   Their stories were backed with lurid color photographs of
alleged torture victims, and videotapes, including a sequence in
which Iraqi troops appeared to fire on peaceful protesters.
   Iraq has denied reports of any systematic abuse by its soldiers.
   No resolution dealing with the issue of war crimes is planned in
the immediate future, said the U.S. senior official and a Soviet
diplomat, partly because the Geneva agreements cover the situation.
   Also, they said, under the ``use of force'' resolution adopted
by the Security Council on Thursday, the world community pledged to
take no new steps against Baghdad until Jan. 15 as a ``pause of
good will.''
   After that date, nations allied with Kuwait's
government-in-exile are authorized by the resolution to ``use all
necessary means'' to liberate the emirate and free the hostages
held by Baghdad.
   ``All necessary means'' covers diplomatic efforts as well as a
military strike to dislodge Iraq and recover the hostages.
   However, the U.S.-led multinational forces massing in the gulf
will not be ready to launch an attack until late January or
February, U.S. officials say. About 200,000 U.S. reinforcements are
on their way to Saudi Arabia.
   A senior Soviet diplomat said there was ``logic'' in the concept
of a resolution after Jan. 15 emphasizing the individual liability
of the Iraqi leaders if the allied nations do not wish to go to war
immediately.
   Shevardnadze warned Thursday that Saddam would be held
``personally responsible'' for any use of chemical or biological
weapons and breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention guaranteeing
the rights of civilians in time of war.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas emphasized the individual
responsibility of Iraq's leaders for war crimes, hinting at
instituting a Nuremberg-style tribunal.
   ``All persons who would be inclined to use biological and
chemical weapons will be personally responsible for that act. That
means we'll take other measures in that direction,'' Dumas said.
   ``I think we'll meet in the next day and see what we can do in
that direction. It was an agreement among ourselves,'' he aid.
   The Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, held between
1945-49, were the first time under international law that the
leaders of a nation were tried for starting an aggressive war.
Nineteen Nazi leaders were sentenced to death by hanging.
   The Council members have now put Iraq on notice that its leaders
will be held liable, the senior U.S. official said.
   A previous Security Council resolution invites nations to
collect evidence of war crimes and submit it to the Council.

<HEAD>Mass Demonstrations in Bangladesh in Defiance of State of
Emergency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people defied
state-of-emergency restrictions in Bangladesh's two largest cities
Friday, holding mass protests demanding that President Hussein
Muhammad Ershad quit, witness accounts said.
   Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters
armed with small bombs in Dhaka, the capital, and the port city of
Chittagong, according to other unofficial reports reaching India.
   Government-controlled Bangladesh Radio said five people were
killed since Tuesday night when Ershad decreed a state of emergency
suspending civil liberties and imposed a curfew. His action
followed six weeks of unrest against his government.
   The official radio, monitored in the eastern Indian city of
Calcutta, said two curfew violators were killed by police on
Wednesday, and two more people were shot dead in clashes between
rival opposition groups the same day. Another was killed Thursday,
also in a fight between rival groups, the radio said.
   Opposition groups said on Thursday that 50 people were killed.
Independent verification was unobtainable because of a news
blackout enforced by government censorship.
   Bangladesh Radio accused foreign media of exaggerating the
casualty reports. It warned that ``stern action will be taken
against any violation of the curfew.''
   Opposition parties, supported by university students, demand
that Ershad resign in favor of a neutral government to supervise
new elections. Ershad, a former army general who seized power in a
bloodless 1982 coup, has refused to step aside.
   Defense analysts and diplomatic sources in India said they
believe Ershad could weather the crisis as long as the army remains
loyal. There has been no sign of revolt from the military in the
latest protests, they said.
   The curfew was lifted for seven hours Friday to allow people to
buy food and attend prayers at mosques on the weekly Islamic holy
day. About 10,000 people poured out of mosques in both Dhaka and
Chittagong and staged protest marches, despite orders banning
rallies or large assemblies.
   In Chittagong, pro-government crowds burned the office of the
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, while govenment troops
combed the city center following a bomb attack on one of their
vehicles, according to unofficial accounts. No injuries were
reported in the bombing.
   The major opposition parties called for a dawn-to-dusk,
nationwide strike on Saturday. Bangladesh Radio reported,
meanwhile, that the curfew would be relaxed from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Saturday in Dhaka, Chittagong and two other cities.
   In Dhaka, the capital of 7 million people, crowds streamed out
of the Baitul Mukarram mosque in the city center, denouncing the
state of emergency and hurling bricks and stones at security
forces, said witness accounts reaching New Delhi.
   Most people dispersed when the curfew was resumed at 3 p.m.
Police used bamboo staves to beat demonstrators who darted in small
groups from side streets to taunt the authorities.
   Earlier, police smashed batons on a group of 200 women who
gathered outside the National Press Club in Dhaka, a favorite spot
for public protests. A few male journalists observing the scene
also received blows.
   No reports were available from Khulna and Rajshahi, two other
large cities where the curfew was lifted for seven hours.
   Newspaper editors, who were summoned by a senior official of
Ershad's government, refused to suspend an indefinite strike called
on Tuesday to protest a decree that all news items about the unrest
be submitted for prior censorship. No newspapers have appeared
since the emergency was imposed.
   The latest anti-government campaign began last month when two
rival opposition groups, the Bangladesh National Party and the
Awami League, called a truce between themselves to challenge
Ershad's announcement that he will run for re-election next year.
   The opposition claims Ershad rigged previous presidential and
parliamentary elections. They vowed to boycott the vote called for
June unless he resigns.
   Ershad came to power following a succession of
military-installed governments which ruled Bangladesh, formerly
East Pakistan, since it broke away from West Pakistan in a 1971
civil war.
   Analysts say he has stayed in office by balancing civilian
bureaucrats against army generals and frequently shuffling the
military command to block the emergence of any power centers within
the establishment.

   Samuel Santiago couldn't leave his apartment
without setting off an electronic ankle bracelet keeping him under
house arrest. But that didn't stop him from committing murder and
armed robbery, police said Friday.
   Santiago, 18, was being held without bond in Cook County Jail on
charges that he shot and killed a man one day, and robbed a pizza
delivery man at gunpoint the next. Police say the crimes occurred
within 100 feet of Santiago's home.
   The electronic monitoring device attached to Santiago's ankle
would have alerted authorities only if he were to go farther than
100 feet from a telephone receiver in his apartment, police said.
   ``He knew just how far he could go without setting off the
alarm,'' said Police Sgt. Ron Rewers.
   Santiago had served about a year of a three-year prison term for
auto theft. Because his record in prison was good, he was assigned
to the home monitoring program in October, said Nic Howell, a
spokesman for the Illinois corrections department.
   Authorities say Santiago and Federico Conde, 19, on Monday lured
Rudy del Castillo to a passageway outside Santiago's home on the
pretense of selling him cocaine.
   They robbed the 18-year-old victim of several gold chains and
about $1,300 in cash and then shot him, Rewers said.
   Police suspected Santiago in the crime but did not arrest him
until the next evening, after he robed a pizza delivery man of $70
and investigators searched his apartment, Rewers said.
   They also arrested Conde, who was last seen with the shooting
victim, and charged him with murder. He was being held in lieu of
$270,000 bond, a jail official said.
   Santiago is the first of 1,800 inmates assigned to home
monitoring since June 1989 to be charged with a serious offense,
Howell said. Eleven people under home monitoring have been charged
with lesser crimes, and only two were convicted, he said.
   ``We do a lot of watching of these guys. Our concern is for the
safety of the public, and we're not going to put someone on this
program that we think is going to get into trouble,'' Howell said.
   ``This one incident should not bear on the rest of the
program,'' he said, noting that Illinois prisons already are
overcrowded with nearly 10,000 more inmates than the
maximum-capacity 18,857.
   A spokeswoman for Gov. James Thompson also defended the home
monitoring program, saying it is necessary to relieve the state's
badly overcrowded prisons.
   ``It's a great system. It's just not a perfect system,'' said
spokeswoman Jill Fowler.
   A recent federal report said Illinois' prison population rose
more rapidly than any other state in the nation last year.

<HEAD>Bush Sending Baker to Iraq but Ready for All-Out War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush announced Friday he's sending
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to Iraq in a last-ditch
diplomatic effort to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait.
   But the president, armed with a new U.N. resolution authorizing
force, also said he's ready to wage war if the mission fails, and
with ``enough power to get the job done.'' He declared, ``There
will not be any murky ending.''
   In addition to sending Baker to meet with Saddam, Bush said he
has invited Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz for a mid-December
White House meeting on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   He said the two-part diplomatic overture was an attempt to
present the U.S. case directly to Iraq's leader. ``I hope what it
does is demonstrate that we are prepared to go face-to-face and
tell him how committed we are to the United Nations resolutions''
insisting Iraqi troops leave occupied Kuwait.
   Bush, announcing the decision in a statement from the White
House briefing room at the opening of a news conference, said
Baker's mission would be at a ``mutually convenient time'' between
Dec. 15 and Jan. 15.
   ``It isn't a trip of concession,'' Bush asserted, even though it
reverses the administration's previous opposition to sending
emissaries to Iraq.
   There was no immediate word from Baghdad on the development. But
the Iraqi Ambassador to France, Abdul Razzack al Hashimi, called
Bush's announcement ``a very important step toward peace.''
   In an interview with BBC radio, the Iraqi official said, ``We
hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for,
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war. And this is
really, I consider it very good news.''
   Bush hailed Thursday's United Nations Security Council vote
authorizing force and setting a deadline of Jan. 15 for Iraq's
troops to leave Kuwait.
   ``I remain hopeful that we can achieve a peaceful solution to
this crisis. But if force is required, we and the other 26
countries who have troops in the area will have enough power to get
the job done,'' he said.
   The president added that any such battle ``will not be another
Vietnam. This will not be a protracted, drawn-out war. ... I pledge
to you there will not be any murky ending.''
   Bush said he would continue to consult with congressional
leaders but had no plans to convene a special session of Congress.
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., senior Republican on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, said the proposed diplomatic contacts
would provide ``wiggle room'' for Saddam, and said, ``Anything the
president can do to keep the focus of the crisis on diplomacy and
not on war is all to the good.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Bush's opening of
a high-level diplomatic channel was a ``positive step.''
   ``I think it's another indication that the president wants a
peaceable settlement,'' Dole said.
   Bush defended anew his decision to send 430,000 U.S. troops into
the region. ``I want peace, not war. But if there must be a war, we
will not permit our troops to have their hands tied behind their
backs,'' he said.
   The president removed his glasses and his eyes were moist as he
was asked if, as a father of four children, he felt the need to
drive Iraq from Kuwait was important enough to ask parents to
sacrifice the lives of sons and daughters in the armed services.
   ``People say to me, how many lives? How many lives can you
expend? Each one is precious. ... I know what it's like to have
fallen comrades and see young kids die in battle,'' he said.
   But, he added, if a shot is fired in anger, ``I want to
guarantee each person that their kid, whose life is in harm's way,
will have the maximum support, will have their best chance to come
home alive, and will be backed up to the hilt.''
   In the past, administration officials have opposed the sending
of emissaries to Baghdad to meet with Saddam, and Bush was asked
what made him change his mind.
   ``The United Nations resolution I think has a good chance of
making Saddam Hussein understand what it is he's up against. I have
not felt that he got the message. ... So it's just going the extra
step, that's what it is. and it's a decision that I personally
made.''
   Bush said that his own meeting with Aziz, Iraq's foreign
minister, would occur the week of Dec. 10 and that he would also
invite foreign ministers from U.S. allies in the gulf to attend.
   He said he - and Baker at the later meeting with Saddam - ``will
be prepared ... to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis.''
   A number of Democrats - and some Republicans - in Congress have
criticized Bush's gulf policy, and former military officials also
have questioned his Mideast buildup in hearings that continued
Friday. But Bush said if Congress wanted a special session, it
would have to call one itself.
   ``They have the power ... to come back 20 seconds from now,'' he
said. ``If they want to come back here and endorse what the
president of the United States has done and what the United Nations
Secrity Council has done, come on, we're ready,'' he said.
   After his news conference, Bush telephoned Saudi Arabia's King
Fahd, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Turkey's President Turgot
Ozal and the exiled emir of Kuwait.
   Asked their reaction to his announcement, he said later, ``It's
all been very very positive.''
   In his speech and news conference afterward, Bush also:
   - Disclosed that Iraqis have recently appeared unexpectedly at
the besieged U.S. Embassy in Kuwait with deliveries of cigarettes,
fruits and vegetables. He said he understood there would be another
delivery on Saturday including soft drinks.
   - Disputed critics who have minimized the potential Iraqi
nuclear threat, saying ``I am not going to err on the side of
underestimation.''

   Next to the two front seats in the cramped Soviet
space capsule heading into orbit Sunday is an extra chair that's
turning out to be the Kremlin's ticket to cosmic profits.
   The seat on the Soyuz capsule has held pure, space-grown
crystals worth millions of dollars and valuable products of space
experiments, as well as cosmonauts from other countries.
   On Sunday, the seat will carry the first journalist - and first
Japanese - to space under a commercial agreement that officials
hope will turn new profits for the Soviet space program.
   Toyohiro Akiyama, of Japan's biggest television company TBS,
will ride on the Soyuz TM-11 under a contract between the company
and the Soviet Union.
   The network is paying about $11 million for the honor, and is
working out other agreements with agencies that are emerging as
profit-making arms of the Soviet space industry.
   The flight is part of a push to make the Soviet space program
more self-sufficient, as the United States also has tried to do.
   An overburdened national budget and a critically ailing economy
have put tremendous pressure on Soviet officials. Last year, they
suspended the Soyuz flights and left the orbiting Mir space station
unoccupied for four months to save money.
   The eight-day Soyuz TM-11 flight will be the eighth to hook up
with the Mir space station since it was put up in 1986. Soviet
cosmonauts Musa Manarov and Victor Afanasyev have been designated
to replace Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov in the Mir, while
Akiyama delivers live, exclusive radio and TV reports of his
experience.
   Although Soviet scientists and 14 foreign astronauts have ridden
in the third seat, Akiyama will be the first non-scientific, paying
passenger.
   He is scheduled to conduct experiments on Japanese Tree Frogs,
an idea proposed by the Japanese to see how they cope in the
gravity-free environment.
   Back on Earth, he'll deliver speeches and travel to talk about
the experience, which TBS has billed as a celebration of its 40th
year on the air.
   TBS is sending about 120 reporters, cameramen and technicians to
document the flight from Baikonur Cosmodrome, a once-secret complex
1,560 miles from Moscow in the Kazakhstan desert. At least one top
official, a former aide to Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,
will also witness the midday launch.
   On Friday, the 161-foot-tall Soyuz rocket was rolled out to the
launch pad in front of Soviet, Japanese and other foreign
journalists. Scores of space technicians, in black coveralls and
orange helmets, scurried around the rocket to raise it to a
standing position and prepare it for liftoff.
   The deputy chief of testing, Maj. Gen. Alexei A. Shumilin, told
reporters the flight will have great political significance by
setting a precedent for Soviet cooperation with other countries.
   ``The flight will make a profit, although we are not sure how
much,'' he said. ``But interest in this launch ... will give us a
chance to see how profitable the flights can be.''
   Standing in below-freezing weather, the Soyuz rocket stood tall
on the launch pad at the 35-year-old space complex, opened over two
years ago to foreign visitors.
   The complex, where most Soviet satellites and spaceships are
launched, is also the site of the country's worst space disasters,
including an explosion that destroyed a satellite just seconds
after liftoff in early October.
   The Japanese government has no official connection with Sunday's
launch, a TBS official in Baikonur said. But, executive producer
Ichiro Sasaki said: ``the Japanese people will have a better
understanding of this country ... and we hope the Soviets will
understand us better.''
   TBS has declined to officially say how much Akiyama's space
flight is costing them, but Sasaki confirmed that the amount is
roughly $11 million, the figure quoted in the media.
   He said disarray in the Soviet space industry, caused by
economic reforms and government restructuring, has complicated the
joint project.
   ``This is one of their (the space industry's) first attempts at
business with foreigners, but they are still using Soviet ways of
doing business,'' Sasaki said.
   The Soviets now are talking with China, Spain, Turkey and Iran
to send up paying passengers. Britain, Austria, Germany and France
already are planning to pay for seats on a Soviet capsule,
according to U.S. space expert James Oberg.

   An old bridge has risen from the
water as the inundated town of Monticello re-emerges from a
man-made lake that's receding after four years of drought.
   With each dry day, receding Lake Berryessa reveals more remains
of the town, once a thriving farming community before the
government claimed it for a dam and reservoir in the 1950s.
   ``There was almost nothing left when they got through,''
remembered Harold Moskowitz, 64, who was raised in Monticello and
now lives near the dwindling lake. ``They paid us off, gave
buildings away, tore some down and burned some. What they couldn't
burn they buried.
   ``The only thing left would be some streets and foundations.
They didn't leave anything over 6 inches high, even the trees. It
was a sad thing to lose that town.''
   Now, hundreds of tourists and former residents are trekking to
the lake, about 50 miles northeast of San Francisco, to glimpse the
past and remember the town's century of life.
   ``I was born in the valley and was about 10 years old when it
went under,'' said Ronnie McGuinnis, a maintenance worker for the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, which manages the lake and recreational
area.
   ``I think people are coming back because they are still
distressed and remember being uprooted. They couldn't believe it
was possible that this gigantic government could come in a tell
them to get out. It's almost like we were Indians and they wanted
our land.''
   The valley originally was inhabited by Indians - Pomo, Miwok and
Wappo tribes - who retreated as Europeans settled. The valley and
lake were named for Jose and Sisto Berryessa, brothers from Spain
who began the La Putas Rancho in 1943 in the area soon known for
raising grain and cattle.
   About 500 people lived in the valley but dwindled to about 125
by the 1950s when water was getting scarce as Northern California
grew. The federal government formed a plan with Solano County to
dam Putah River to create a reservoir in the valley, which sits
mostly in adjacent Napa County.
   The 1,000-foot-long, 304-foot-high Monticello Dam created a
reservoir that supplies Solano County and serves as a for seven
resorts.
   Berryessa normally is three miles across at its widest point and
26 miles long, but is about one-third that size after losing 60
percent of its water. This week, the lake surface fell to 377 feet
above sea level - nearly 12 feet lower than during the drought of
1976-77 and 63 feet below normal. The average 30 inches of rain a
year at Berryessa has dropped by half since the 1986 floods,
causing the lake level to fall 15-20 feet annually.
   ``If it doesn't rain, this lake could dry up in a few years,
then you'll really get to see the whole town,'' said Jim Peterson,
maintenance foreman for the reclamation bureau.
   Downtown Monticello remains under 50 to 60 feet of water, but
outlying areas are being revealed as the lake dries up - a
foundation here, an old swimming pool there along with sunken
boats, motors, fishing poles and tennis shoes. Indian artifacts
also have been found.
   Roads unused for three decades have fresh tire tracks from
explorers while a 1941 bridge, under water until this summer, is
marked by muddy footprints as the span sits 6 feet above the lake's
surface.
   ``People can walk across if they want, but it doesn't go
anywhere,'' Peterson said. ``For some reason, though, we're getting
a lot of visitors even though there's not much to see except a few
concrete slabs.''
   Park ranger Arnold Roessler, who's busy these days telling
visitors how to find the emerging bits of the past, said people are
searching for more.
   ``It's too bad about the drought, but some people are hoping
that it continues just so we can see what's really down there,''
said ranger Arnold Roessler. ``It's like a developing mystery.''

<HEAD>China's Envoy Meets with Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush met Friday with Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and said differences over human rights
continue to affect relations with Beijing 18 months after the
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Bush also said there are ``many positive and very important
aspects'' in relations between the two countries. It was Qian's
first visit to Washington since China snuffed out the pro-democracy
movement at Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
   Qian spent more than two hours with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III before calling on Bush at the White House.
   ``I think the Chinese government knows we have some differences
on this whole broad question of human rights,'' Bush said as he and
Qian posed for photographers. ``But we have many things in
common.''
   ``One purpose of this kind of meeting is to reduce the
differences,'' Bush said.
   He said the U.S. government has a ``very frank relationship''
with Qian and the ability to discuss differences openly.
   Qian offered no public remarks, but on Thursday a Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Beijing said he felt that any discussion of
human rights at Friday's meetings was inappropriate interference in
China's internal affairs.
   Qian came here from New York, where he cast an abstention
Thursday on the Security Council resolution authorizing the use of
force against Iraq.
   State Department officials were surprised and disappointed
because Chinese officials had led them to believe that Qian would
support the resolution.
   Nonetheless, Bush praised China's willingness to ``stand up to
aggression'' by Iraq in Kuwait, an apparent reference to China's
support for all previous Security Council resolutions on Iraq.
   For unexplained reasons, the State Department announced the
Bush-Qian meeting Friday morning, then indicated it had been
cancelled. But Qian turned up at the White House at the time
initially announced by the State Department and spent a little more
than a half hour with Bush.
   In announcing Qian's visit here, the State Department insisted
that the administration's policy of no high-level exchanges with
China was still in effect. Officials pointed out that Baker has met
with Qian three times in New York and once each in Cairo and Paris.
   The State Department explained that ``contacts'' with Chinese
officials are permitted but not ``large ceremonial exchanges.''
That prohibition was imposed after Chinese authorities unleashed
military forces against the Tiananmen Square demonstrators.
Military sales also are banned.
   As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has been
deeply involved in Persian Gulf diplomacy, enabling it to overcome
somewhat the relative diplomatic isolation it experienced in the
aftermath of the suppression of the Tiananmen Square movement.

   Iraq on Friday blamed passage of the U.N. use-of-force
resolution on ``pressure, terrorism and bribes'' from Washington.
President Bush made a surprise diplomatic overture to Saddam
Hussein but also issued a warning.
   If military conflict does break out, Bush said, ``it will not be
another Vietnam, this will not be another protracted, drawn-out
war.''
   In the fourth day of Senate hearings on the Persian Gulf crisis,
a former U.S. intelligence official urged Washington not to rush
toward war with Iraq.
   Oil prices tumbled more than $3 a barrel - to $29.90 - on the
New York Mercantile Exchange after Bush suggested sending Secretary
of State James A. Baker III to Baghdad to seek an end to the
crisis.
   Before Bush's remarks cooled temperatures, Saddam's ruling
Revolutionary Command Council called the U.N. Security Council
resolution passed Thursday ``illegal, null and void,'' saying it
was imposed by the United States.
   ``It is first and foremost an American decision in which certain
powers participated only under American pressure,'' it said. ``The
United States practiced all forms of pressure, terrorism and
bribes'' to pass the measure.
   The statement, broadcast on state-run Baghdad Radio, said that
if forced to fight, Iraq would teach the United States and its
allies a ``hard lesson, unprecedented in history.''
   The U.N. resolution authorizes the United States and its allies
to use force to drive Iraq from Kuwait unless Saddam withdraws his
troops by Jan. 15. Iraq invaded the emirate on Aug. 2 in a dispute
over oil, land and money.
   In a nationally televised speech, Bush said he was willing to
send Baker to Baghdad to negotiate Iraq's unconditional withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   If Iraq agrees, Baker would travel to Baghdad between Dec. 15
and Jan. 15, Bush said. Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, would
be welcome in Washington for talks the week of Dec. 10, he said.
   Bush said he was ``going the extra mile'' for peace.
   The move does not mean, however, the United States is waivering
in its demand for a total Iraqi withdrawal, restoration of the
Kuwaiti government and release of all Western hostages from Iraq
and Kuwait, Bush said.
   The surprise diplomatic olive branch, however, was combined with
a stern new warning for Saddam.
   ``I promise you there will not be any murky ending. I will never
agree to a halfway effort,'' Bush said. ``I don't think there has
ever been a question that the United States is going to blink.''
   Iraq's leadership was taken by surprise by Bush's announcement
and immediately went into a meeting for consultations, diplomats
said in Baghdad. There were no immediate details on who attended
the meeting.
   But there was reaction to the proposed Baker visit from Abdul
Razzack al Hashimi, Iraq's ambassador to France, who spoke in an
interview in Paris with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   ``This is a very important step, really, toward peace, and we
hope it is going to achieve what we are all striving for,
negotiations instead of beating the drums of war. ... I consider it
very good news,'' he said.
   ``Let's wait and see, and let's be optimistic, and see what Mr.
Baker has in mind, and not to speculate about such an important
event.''
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
welcomed Bush's call for diplomatic contact with Iraq.
   ``I am persuaded that if these contacts take place, they will be
really, really leading to a peaceful solution,'' Perez de Cuellar
told reporters.
   And in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabian and exiled Kuwaiti
officials applauded Bush's last-ditch effort.
   Bush's diplomatic move came amid growing criticism on Capitol
Hill for the Bush administration's gulf policy.
   During the week, a series of witnesses, including two former
Joint Chiefs of Staff, have underscored doubts among Democratic
senators about going to war with Iraq.
   On Friday, retired Lt. Gen. William E. Odom, who headed the
National Security Agency during the Reagan administration, said
Washington should continue its present defensive posture rather
than wage war with Iraq.
   He said that attacking Iraqi forces in Kuwait - or Iraq itself -
could mean a long U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf
region.
   About 240,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Saudi Arabia as part
of the 340,000-strong multinational force arrayed against Iraq.
Bush has promised to add 200,000 more to the largest deployment
abroad since the Vietnam war.
   The multinational force faces 430,000 Iraqi troops in southern
Iraq and Kuwait.
   In an another apparent conciliatory move Friday, a group of
Iraqis took fruit, vegetables and a case of cigarettes to the
besieged American Embassy in Kuwait, Bush said. The Americans were
also told by the Iraqis, who were not identified, to make a list of
medical supplies they needed, he said.
   ``This could be a positive sign,'' Bush said.
   Shortly after the invasion, Saddam ordered all missions closed
in Kuwait, which Iraq considers its 19th province. The embassies
that refused to shut were surrounded by troops and utilities were
cut.
   Only the U.S. and British embassies still remain open, but with
much-reduced staffs. At the U.S. Embassy, the eight remaining
personnel have been surviving on canned tuna and rice, Bush said.

<TEXT>
   They've been seeing the same posters and hearing
the same speeches, but the campaign for Sunday's all-German
elections strikes different chords among voters east and west.
   For former West Germans, the candidates are familiar, the vote
itself routine and the major issue is just how severe the expected
tax increases to finance unity will be.
   In what used to be East Germany, the plethora of parties ranging
from the right-wing Republicans to the leftist Greens is still a
novelty for voters who lived in a one-party Communist state.
   Eastern Germans need help in rebuilding their shattered economy,
and are looking for the best leaders to do it.
   ``The elections are important for the future development of East
Germany,'' said Bodo Hahnet, director of a job retraining program
in Potsdam.
   A voice from former West Germany puts it differently.
   ``These elections aren't so important. They won't change
anything,'' said Helmut Hilbig, a doctor from the Ruhr industrial
area city of Moenchengladbach.
   Just over a year ago, Hahnet and Hilbig lived in separate worlds
in separate countries.
   Now they are part of a pool of 60 million German voters to go to
the polls Sunday, 12 million in the five new states in eastern
Germany and 48 million from former West Germany.
   They will choose a 656-member Parliament and a new chancellor in
the first free elections in a united Germany since 1932.
   Helmut Kohl, the incumbent chancellor who guided the two German
states to unity after the Berlin Wall collapsed on Nov. 9, 1989, is
the clear favorite.
   His campaign workers have slathered the country with large
portraits of the beefy, prosperous-looking leader that simply
proclaims: ``Chancellor for Germany.''
   That image is appealing in eastern Germany where Kohl is more
popular than among his countrymen in the west, who are sometimes
embarrassed by the chancellor's folksy ways.
   A recent poll in the weekly Der Spiegel magazine showed that 20
percent of eastern Germans thought Kohl was the greatest postwar
chancellor against 10 percent of western Germans.
   Overall, Kohl's reception at campaign rallies in eastern Germany
has been warmer than in the west.
   Supporters of Oskar Lafontaine, Kohl's Social Democratic rival
have also been busy bringing the image of the youthful challenger
to voters.
   Lafontaine, 47, stands among a group of young people, peering
off into the distance under the slogan: ``The new way'' in his main
poster.
   Many eastern Germans just seem to want a way that works.
   For Hilbig, the western German, Kohl and Lafontaine are old
faces on a familiar political scene. But even though he doesn't
expect much to change as a result of the election, he expects
unification to have a serious impact on his income.
   ``We're going to end up paying like crazy,'' he said, a
reference to expected tax increases needed to bring the backward
east up to the standards of the west.
   Talks with other western Germans at the Brandenburg Gate in
Berlin revealed similar concerns about the country's finances.
   Kohl, portraying himself as the kind of solid, hardworking
leader who can bring western prosperity to the east, says no new
taxes will be needed.
   Nonsense, argues Lafontaine, who has pounded away with charges
of hypocrisy. He says the Christian Democrats have deceived voters
by underestimating the real costs of unity.
   ``Nobody is telling the truth,'' growled Hahnet, the eastern
German. ``The Christian Democrats don't really say what is
happening.''
   Politicians from the broad palette of opposition parties have a
lot to say, but many are so small their voices get lost despite
access for all parties to television.
   The Free Democrats are counting on Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher to pull in votes in his native eastern
Germany where he is extremely popular.
   Other parties push platforms rather than people, with the Greens
for ecology and the right-wing Republicans for restricting asylum
rules.
   Although the messages differ, for the first time in 58 years
Germans will choose freely their leaders in a safe and secure
democracy.

   A U.S. thrift regulator testified Friday that
Sen. Dennis DeConcini broke the bounds of propriety - but four
other senators did not - when they intervened on behalf of savings
and loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Regulator Michael Patriarca, addressing the Senate Ethics
Committee, drew the line between the behavior of DeConcini, D-Ariz.
and four colleagues: John McCain, R-Ariz.; Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio and Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Patriarca said it was wrong for a senator to attempt to
``influence, to change the outcome'' of an examination that was
highly critical of Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   ``My personal view is Senator DeConcini did that,'' he said.
``It's not clear to me that any of the others did.''
   The regulator was referring to the senators' conduct at an April
9, 1987 meeting with four San Francisco-based regulators -
including Patriarca - who were responsible for the Lincoln
investigation.
   Patriarca also said he would fault the senators generally,
because they ``appeared to have made up their minds in advance''
that Keating was right and the regulators were wrong in finding
serious problems at Lincoln.
   Patriarca's two days of testimony backed the assertion of his
ex-boss, former Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin J.
Gray, that DeConcini took the lead in trying to negotiate a deal on
Keating's behalf.
   DeConcini denied that he sought a waiver for Lincoln of a rule
prohibiting risky investments, in return for the thrift
establishing a home mortgage loan program.
   Patriarca was questioned by Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., one of
six Ethics Committee members who will judge whether the five
senators improperly intervened for Keating.
   Keating and associates donated $1.3 million to the campaigns and
political causes of the five senators. The committee has held nine
days of hearings in an effort to determine whether the money
influenced the intervention.
   The hearing adjourned until Monday after a former member of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board testified he received calls from
Cranston and DeConcini in April 1989 - immediately before the
government takeover of Lincoln.
   In those calls, said Roger Martin, both senators urged the board
to approve a sale of Lincoln rather than its seizure. The requests
were rejected.
   All the senators except Riegle met on Keating's behalf with Gray
on April 2, 1987 in DeConcini's office. When the chief regulator
said he lacked details of the Lincoln investigation, the four San
Francisco-based regulators including Patriarca, were summoned to
the April 9 meeting. That also was in DeConcini's office and this
time Riegle joined the group.
   Rudman asked Patriarca whether he thought DeConcini was ``out of
line'' in the April 9 meeting, when he sought the waiver for
Lincoln.
   ``Yes I did, senator,'' the regulator responded. He said that
the proper way to challenge the regulation was through the courts
and Lincoln ``had a retainer with every significant law firm in the
country'' to do so.
   Lincoln in fact did, shortly before the meetings with
regulators, file a court suit challenging the rule. The suit was
not successful.
   Patriarca said McCain showed the ``least prejudice'' toward
regulators at the April 9 meeting; DeConcini and ``perhaps Sen.
Glenn seemed to have their minds made up pretty substantially'' and
Riegle was ``in the middle.''
   Another member of the committee, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., asked
if the senators were hostile at the meeting.
   ``I think it was hostile,'' Patriarca said. ``We were being
dressed down.''
   Helms then asked whether the senators expressed ``surprise or
shock'' after the regulators informed them that serious problems -
and possible criminality - were found at Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif.
   ``We didn't seem to be getting through to the senators,'' the
regulator said. ``They did not seem to appreciate the seriousness
of the situation that we were trying to convey to them.''
   On Thursday, Patriarca said the senators became less aggressive
when regulators said they would make criminal referrals to the
Justice Department.

   Iben Browning gets all the attention,
but he isn't the only one with notions about when a big earthquake
will shake the Midwest.
   Ted the Rooster says it won't happen next week. Raymond Cole's
radio says it might.
   Browning's theory that a quake is likely along the New Madrid
Fault zone early next week has sent emotional shock waves from
Illinois to Arkansas.
   The uproar also brought new popularity to backyard prophets who
base their predictions on such things as lost dogs, radio waves and
a prognosticating rooster.
   The attempts to predict an earthquake have one thing in common -
scientists say they are worthless.
   ``Earthquakes are unpredictable,'' said Jill Stevens,
spokeswoman for the Center for Earthquake Research and Information
at Memphis (Tenn.) State University. ``They are one of the most
mysterious natural events we have to deal with.''
   Scientists have searched unsuccessfully for decades for reliable
signs that a temblor is due. The public is eager to join the hunt,
Ms. Stevens said.
   ``Every year we hear from people with pet theories about
earthquakes,'' Ms. Stevens said.
   ``One woman in Ohio says she has a television set that gets
different patterns of `snow' before an earthquake,'' she said.
``There's a woman in Memphis who monitors the classified ads to see
if the number of lost pets is up because she thinks that means a
quake is coming.''
   She said the number of people calling the center to offer or
seek advice has skyrocketed since Browning, a self-proclaimed
climatologist from New Mexico, projected of a 50-50 chance for a
Midwest quake around Dec. 3.
   Browning, 72, bases his theory on the gravitational pull of the
sun and moon, which he says will be particularly strong during the
period.
   Ted the rooster is getting a lot of calls, too.
   The rooster, locally famous for forecasting weather and the
outcome of presidential elections, says there will be no
earthquake, according to his owner, Dick Frymire of Irvington, Ky.
   ``I've had hundreds of calls about it from all over the United
States,'' Frymire said. ``People are scared to death.''
   Raymond Cole of Cape Girardeau, Mo., makes his quake predictions
by charting slight changes in the location of AM signals on his
radio dial. He believes The Big One is coming soon.
   Because of interest stirred by Browning, Cole makes his
forecasts available free 24 hours a day on a special phone line
connected to an answering machine at his home.
   ``That answering machine goes constantly, as fast as it can
rewind,'' Cole said. ``I've worn out four tapes in two months.''
   Ms. Stevens said quake quackery is fueled by scientists'
inability to predict earthquakes, combined with the accepted theory
that a damaging quake will someday occur along the New Madrid.
   The fault, which stretches from New Madrid, Mo., to Marked Tree,
Ark., produces numerous quakes a year, including huge temblors in
1811 and 1812.
   The best scientists can do is chart probabilities based on
statistical analysis of seismic activity along the fault since
1811, she said. And even those methods are uncertain.
   A widely quoted study done at the Memphis center puts the
probability of an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 or greater on the
Richter scale within the next 15 years at between 40 percent and 63
percent.
   An independent study released this year by two scientists who
work with the U.S. Geological Survey put the risk lower - setting a
13 percent probability of a New Madrid quake of 6.0 or greater
within the next 10 years.
   ``Both are valid scientific studies using different methods,''
Ms. Stevens said.
   Still, people along the fault are listening to the predictions.
   Among them is Austin Peay State University geology professor
D.M.S. Bhatia, who is setting up camp along the fault with 25
students to prove Browning wrong.
   ``We're going to jump up and down on the fault and show there's
no reason for all this panic,'' said Bhatia.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Military Goods in South Korea Being Resold on Black
Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Need some oxtail meat? A bottle of Chivas
Regal? Or how about hair spray? South Korea is a good place to get
them, courtesy of Uncle Sam.
   A report by the General Accounting Office has found widespread
black marketing of goods sold to U.S. military personnel and their
dependents at duty-free stores and commissaries in South Korea.
   A ration control system set up to prevent the goods from being
resold on the black market has failed, according to the report by
the congressional watchdog agency. The system, it said, costs $12
million annually.
   Investigators said they could not put a dollar figure on the
amount of goods diverted to the black market, but said sales rates
for many items could not be accounted for simply by the estimated
70,000 people authorized to buy them.
   For example, during fiscal year 1989, Army and Air Force
commissaries in South Korea received about 1.2 million pounds of
oxtail meat for sale. That means about 16 pounds for every woman,
man and child authorized to buy commissary items.
   And while oxtail meat is not a staple in Americans' diet, it's a
popular Korean dish used especially in soup.
   Chivas Regal Scotch, especially 12-year-old bottles, is also a
popular item in South Korea, the report found.
   The investigators compared Chivas sales among U.S. military
personnel in Europe and South Korea. While the number of U.S.
military personnel in South Korea was only 15 percent that in
Europe, commissaries and stores sold more than six times as many
bottles.
   Aqua Net hair spray is also popular - 33 cans per authorized
females.
   Some of the black market sales are conducted by service
personnel, others by South Korean employees at U.S. stores and
commissaries. Most of the items are paid for and then sold at two
or three times the price on the black market.
   High-ticket items, such as refrigerators and video recorders,
diverted to the black market are often obtained with falsified
ration cards, the report said.
   Yet despite the widespread problem, only 66 military personnel
were court-martialed for black market abuses in 1988, and an
unknown number of others received less serious penalties, the
report said.
   It recommended that the Department of Defense improve the ration
control system and encourage the South Korean government to crack
down on black marketeers.

<TEXT>
   The parliaments of the three Baltic
republics prepared to hold their first joint session Saturday to
show a unified front against recent threats from the Soviet
government.
   In an interview, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said
the Baltics want their unity of position to be seen ``not only in
the form of declarations and documents but in the meeting of
lawmakers.''
   The parliaments of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were to meet in
Vilnius to discuss tough statements by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov concerning the Baltics'
independence drives.
   On Friday, talks were held in Moscow between Soviet and
Lithuanian representatives on resolving an impasse that began March
11, when the parliament of the Baltic republic declared
independence.
   The talks, however, were unsuccessful, Deputy Lithuanian Prime
Minister Romualdus Ozolas told the Baltic News Service.
   ``Our position is based on international law, and the position
of the Soviet side is based on Soviet laws. And our positions are
so different, that we could not reach a common formula,'' he said.
   Ozolas and Soviet Deputy Premier Vitaly Doguzhiyev were unable
to set an agenda for more detailed talks, but they did agree to
meet next week, according to the Lithuanian news agency, ELTA.
   Accepting an invitation from Landsbergis, the 220 members of the
Lithuanian parliament were to meet with about 200 Latvian and 100
Estonian legislators in the Lithuanian capital.
   Leaders of all three republics say they will refuse to sign
Gorbachev's proposed Union Treaty to unite the 15 Soviet republics
and grant broad economic and national security authority to the
Gorbachev government.
   Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation - the
largest Soviet republic - also refuses to sign the Union Treaty
until the republics can assert political autonomy and control over
their economic affairs.
   One Lithuanian official said the Union Treaty was doomed.
   Algirdas Brazauskas, a deputy prime minister of the republic who
also heads the branch of the Lithuanian Communist Party that split
with the Soviet Communist Party nearly a year ago, said: ``I think
that the Union Treaty will not succeed because it is too
conservative. It preserves the current political structure of the
Soviet Union and gives too little to the republics.''
   ``Lithuania must be independent or at least be a member of the
(Soviet) Union by its own choice. That's a minimum,'' Brazauskas
said.
   Mindful of the economic blockade Gorbachev slapped on Lithuania
for its independence drive last summer, leaders of Latvia and
Estonia have been more cautious. The Estonian Parliament at first
balked at taking part in the joint legislative session, the
Estonian News Agency ETA reported.
   But the republic's Parliament voted Friday to send its senior
leaders, committee chairmen and other lawmakers to the meeting, ETA
reported.
   Soviet leaders have taken a tough stand against secessionist
republics. A week ago, Gorbachev revived his demand that republics
wishing to secede must first hold referendums.
   And Yazov, his defense minister, warned that Soviet soldiers
would fire on demonstrators who attack defense installations.
   Gorbachev and Yazov also warned civilian authorities not to deny
social benefits to Soviet soldiers.
   The warning appeared in part a response to an incident in
Vilnius in mid-November in which Soviet soldiers fired over the
heads of peaceful demonstrators, said Rita Dapkus, a Lithuanian
parliament spokeswoman.
   Tensions also seemed to be rising over the redeployment in
Lithuania of Soviet army units withdrawing from Eastern Europe,
Dapkus said.
   ``Moscow has to understand it cannot just bring in people and
demand housing, and not ask or even inform us,'' Dapkus said.
Lithuania faces a severe housing shortage for its own citizens.
   Many Lithuanians fear a military crackdown, although Landsbergis
said such action would damage Gorbachev's worldwide prestige as he
seeks food and other aid for Moscow and hard-pressed Soviet cities.
   ``The use of open military force is less of a threat because Mr.
Gorbachev is still under the pressure of the international
situation,'' Landsbergis said.

<TEXT>
   A record 28,000 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel
in November, up 8,000 from the previous high, a senior Israeli
immigration official said Friday.
   The November influx brought to 150,000 the number of Soviet
Jewish immigrants this year. Immigration officials have said that
more than 1 million Soviet Jews could arrive by the end of 1992.
   Simcha Dinitz, head of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency
which brings immigrants to Israel, said 1.2 million Soviet Jews
have won approval to leave the Soviet Union.
   There are no direct flights between Moscow and Tel Aviv, but
Dinitz said that even the more cumbersome routes via Warsaw,
Budapest and Bucharest could handle 50,000 immigrants a month.
   The immigration is causing a strain in unemployment, housing and
government finances in Israel.
   In the 1991 state budget approved by the government this week,
Israel has set aside $6.5 billion for immigrant absorption.
   Dinitz estimated it would cost about $35 billion to absorb 1
million Soviet immigrants, and said Israel and the world Jewish
community could not carry the burden alone.
   ``Israel will have to turn to other countries and foreign
sources for assistance,'' Dinitiz told industrialists in Tel Aviv
on Friday.
   He said a record 30,000 immigrants from around the world arrived
in November, including 28,000 from the Soviet Union. The previous
high was in October when 21,000 immigrants came, including 20,000
Soviet Jews.
   The total number of immigrants from around the world has reached
164,500 so far this year.

<HEAD>Martinez Named To Head War On Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON - President Bush on Friday named outgoing Florida
Gov. Bob Martinez to head the nation's war on drugs, selecting a
politician who stressed law enforcement in fighting his own state's
skyrocketing drug crimes.
   In announcing his choice for director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy, Bush said he was giving Martinez ``a
battlefield promotion for a leader who has earned his stripes on
the front lines of the drug war.
   ``Governor Martinez can and will hit the ground running,'' Bush
added.
   In his four years as governor, Martinez's high-profile anti-drug
policies emphasized tough penalties, law enforcement and prison
construction over treatment and prevention. Meanwhile, drug crimes
escalated significantly during his tenure.
   But Bush praised him as an effective leader in the war on drugs.
   ``He's been contributing to our national drug control strategy
for over two years,'' Bush said.
   ``He stiffened the Florida code and then added the prison space
to enforce it... As a governor who signed more than 130 death
warrants he understands tough choices,'' Bush said.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Martinez will replace William
Bennett, the outspoken conservative who has served as ``drug czar''
for 19 months and now is Bush's choice to head the Republican
National Committee.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, said he was disappointed that Bush selected
Martinez but promised to hold confirmation hearings shortly after
Congress convenes in January.
   ``Mr. Martinez lacks the background and record to suggest that
he is well-suited for this task,'' Biden said. He said he looks
forward to a debate with Martinez on administration policies and
whether he is willing to try new approaches.
   Martinez is expected to bring a more businesslike approach to
the job than Bennett, who was noted for his feisty, bully-pulpit
rhetoric in bringing national focus on the drug crisis.
   Martinez told reporters he will continue to emphasize tough
enforcement measures. ``The balance is always being debated,''
between enforcement and treatment and prevention dollars, he said.
   Bush's choice ofMartinez, who lost his re-election bid this
month to Democratic former Sen. Lawton Chiles, prompted criticism
from some quarters that the president was more interested in giving
his friend a job than choosing the best qualified person.
   Bush and his wife Barbara made several campaign appearances for
Martinez in the tightly contested race and Bush's Florida-resident
son Jeb Bush served as the governor's campaign chairman.
   Martinez ``has a great resume when it comes to politics,'' said
Rep. Charles Rangel, Democratic chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics.
   ``What experience does he have that qualified him directly and
specifically for the post of national drug policy coordinator?''
   The Drug Policy Foundation, a non-profit organization, alleged
that Bush showed ``he would rather reward his political buddies
than solve the drug abuse problem in the United States.''
   ``After four years of Martinez' leadership, Florida is awash
with drugs, crime, corruption and violence,'' said the
organization's president, Arnold Trebach.
   Martinez, a former mayor of Tampa, became governor in 1987 as
Florida's involvement with drug trafficking was escalating and the
crack cocaine epidemic became rampant.
   The number of people imprisoned for drug crimes doubled during
Martinez' tenure, to 16,169 in the 1989-90 fiscal year, according
to state Department of Correction figures.
   Overall, drug crimes jumped from close to 57,000 in 1986 to
85,525 in 1989. THe first six months of 1990 had 37,474 drug crimes
compared to 32,962 in the first six months of 1989.
   Martinez advocated drug testing for government employees, and
took a test himself to show that he was drug free.
   He pushed through the legislature laws mandating the death
penalty for drug kingpins in certain cases and requiring tougher
penalties for drug dealers who traffic near schools.
   He is chairman of the National Governors Association task force
on substance abuse and drug trafficking. He visited Bolivia and
Colombia in 1988 with the National Guard on a drug fact-finding
mission.
   While Democrats criticized Martinez for embarking on a huge
prison building program, the governor has noted that spending on
substance abuse treatment rose from $43 million in 1985-86 to
almost $92 million.
   In a report released earlier this month, Bennett's office listed
Florida seventh in the nation on spending per capita for drug
treatment.
   During the gubernatorial campaign, Chiles called Martinez's
prison construction program ``a primitive approach'' to the drug
problem.
   ``There are thousands of people on waiting lists for drug
treatment and the need far outstrips any programs currently in
place,'' Chiles said.
   Chiles has since said he supports Martinez as drug czar.

   George Bush got the body bag question at his
news conference Friday. How many kids would you be willing to have
die in the Persian Gulf, Mr. President?
   Body bags - a fact of war, a Vietnam residue, the black plastic
containers into which a corpse is zippered at the battlefield for
transfer into a reusable metal case in the first step toward burial
at home.
   Along with the soft drinks, along with the gas masks, the
rations, the videos, the paperbacks, the sunglasses and the
ammunition that America is shipping to its troops in the desert,
body bags are being loaded aboard the transports.
   ``We all know,'' Bush's questioner said, ``how important your
children are to you. Do you feel that this issue is important
enough to you that you could conceive of giving up one of their
lives for it?''
   It was the between-the-eyes question that any president must
dread when he is about to put lives at risk, whatever the cause.
   The question confronts the country now that the U.N., at Bush's
request, has set a deadline for Saddam Hussein to pull out of
Kuwait.
   Bush sighed. He grasped the lectern. He fidgeted. He gestured
with his glasses. He talked slowly. He spent a few minutes with
this question.
   He said people have asked before: ``People say to me, `How many
lives, how many lives can you expend?'''
   ``It's only the president that should be asked to make the
decision, is it worth it? How many lives is it worth? Is it worth
it to commit one life, put one life in harm's way to achieve these
objectives?''
   Somberly he continued in a rambling discourse:
   -He knows the horror of war; he has been in war.
   -Every life is precious. If there is a war, he has ordered
maximum firepower to be applied to protect the lives of Americans
in combat.
   -Saddam Hussein can avoid war by complying with U.N. demands.
   -But is it worth the loss of life?
   ``It's a tough question,'' the president said, but ``these are
worldwide principles of moral importance.''
   How many lives?
   Experts make their gulf estimates from past wars and the
situation on the ground. The estimates vary widely.
   On the record, the Pentagon will not say how many American lives
it anticipates would be expended to achieve U.S. objectives in a
war with Iraq. At a news briefing Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams repeatedly refused to provide a projection. ``I would
dispute anyone's ability now to accurately predict casualties
without knowing what the scenario is.''
   The New York Times, citing Pentagon sources, reported on Tuesday
that ``several thousand'' American deaths would be likely over
several weeks of an all-out war. Retired Gen. George Crist, on CBS
News, said about 1,000 U.S. soldiers would be killed on the first
day.
   Retired Col. Trevor Dupuy told CBS that casualties would range
between 6,000 and 16,000 over the first 10 days of war, but did not
differentiate between dead and injured.
   Retired Adm. Gene LaRocque, director of the Center for Defense
Information and an outspoken opponent of Bush's deployment, has
told Congress there would be 10,000 U.S. deaths in a six-month war
with Iraq.
   In Vietnam, 47,244 Americans were killed in action, 10,446 were
killed in accidents or by disease, 153,329 were hospitalized with
wounds, 150,375 received wounds that did not require
hospitalization.
   Said Bush: ``I will do my level best to bring those kids home
without one single shot fired in anger.''

   Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti officials on Friday
welcomed President Bush's offer to meet with Iraqi leaders, but
stressed they are ready for war.
   Officials in Britain, Jordan and Italy also indicated support
for talks.
   Bush offered to meet in Washington with Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz, and also send Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
the Iraqi capital of Baghdad in advance of the Jan. 15 deadline set
by the U.N. Security Council for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``It's either heads or tails. Either withdraw completely or be
kicked out of Kuwait,'' said Mohamed Khayat, an official with the
Saudi Arabian Ministry of Information.
   Hasan Abdul Aziz, a professor at Kuwait University and a
volunteer in the Kuwaiti Information Office in Saudi Arabia, said
he doubted that diplomacy would work with Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein.
   ``We are convinced this person and his regime understand only
force,'' he said.
   Jordan has attempted to mediate between Iraq and the nations
supporting the ousted Kuwaiti government, and Jordanian Foreign
Minister Marwan Kassem said Bush's offer was in line with Jordan's
proposals for dialogue.
   ``Through dialogue, there is an opportunity for the whole world
to get acquainted with the causes of the crisis,'' Kassem said.
   In London, the Foreign Office issued a statement saying it
welcomed ``anything that would secure full implementation of the
Security Council resolutions'' demanding that Iraq vacate Kuwait.
   ``As President Bush himself has said, nothing less than a
complete Iraqi withdrawal would be tolerated,'' the Foreign Office
statement said.
   A Foreign Office spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Britain had been notified in advance of Bush's statement.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said Bush's
initiative ``seems to me a good thing.''
   ``The fact that the United States, the most important country in
the West, makes a step of this type can only be seen with favor by
a country like Italy which in the next six weeks will leave nothing
unturned in exploring all means that can lead to a peaceful
solution to the crisis,'' De Michelis said.
   De Michelis, speaking to reporters in Venice, Italy, said he had
not been informed in advance of Bush's decision.
   A German government spokesman said there would be no comment at
least until Saturday.
   Spanish Foreign Office spokesman Juan Lena called Bush's offer
positive. The Spanish government supported all initiatives that
could lead to a peaceful solution, Lena said in Madrid.

   The Security Council has given Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein six weeks to pull his troops out of Kuwait
before the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf are
free to launch a military strike.
   The council voted 12-2 Thursday evening, with China abstaining
and Yemen and Cuba opposed, to give Baghdad ``one final
opportunity'' to end its aggression against Kuwait, which began
with the Aug. 2 invasion.
   If Iraq has not withdrawn its army by Jan. 15, restored the emir
of Kuwait's government and freed all hostages it holds, the
U.S.-led multinational force may use ``all necessary means'' to
force Baghdad's compliance.
   It was the first time in 40 years the council had sanctioned
force to counter aggression; the first and last time was when it
gave its blessing to U.S.-led allies in Korea.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Drivers will pay as much as 5.1 cents a gallon
more for gasoline starting Saturday, and they won't be able to
blame Saddam Hussein.
   A federal tax increase is taking effect, and half of the $25
billion it produces over the next five years will go for deficit
reduction. Most of the rest will pay for highway and mass transit
improvements.
   A family that drives 12,000 miles in a car that averages 22
miles per gallon will pay about $28 more a year.
   Flying and shipping by air also will cost more beginning
Saturday. The 8 percent federal tax on airline tickets will rise to
10 percent and the 5 percent levy on air freight will go up to 6.25
percent. Those increases, when combined with higher taxes on
noncommercial aviation fuel, will bring in almost $12 billion over
five years.

hope that if the Soviets are well-fed at home, they'll stay there.
   ``Our policy is to feed them ... so they don't have to come
across the border at all,'' said Asko Mattila, a Finnish Foreign
Ministry official.
   ``A worst, worst-case scenario, with a great migration, like
wolf packs welling over the border ... is not something we regard
as possible,'' said Bjorn Blokhus of the Norwegian Foreign
Ministry.

   UNDATED - In another sign of a weakening economy, the number of
people on welfare rose in all but one state in the past year.
   An Associated Press survey of welfare rolls in all 50 states
found that only Wisconsin had bucked the trend, partly because it
enacted pioneering programs to get people off welfare.
   Although a troubled economy was the villain in many states, it
was not the sole reason - or even the most important one - in
others.
   Officials in some states attributed the increase to changes in
immigration law or to programs that help poor people apply for
welfare. Some mentioned changes in federal Medicaid requirements
that have brought more people into the welfare system.

   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) - The main opposition leader is hailing
``the true end to Communism in Bulgaria,'' after Premier Andrei
Lukanov and his government of former Communists resigned in the
face of massive strikes and street protests.
   Lukanov, who helped engineer the ouster of Communist leader
Todor Zhivkov a year ago, stepped down Thursday and said his
successor will come from outside his Socialist Party that includes
former Communists.
   Lukanov's resignation immediately prompted cheers from tens of
thousands waiting in the streets outside the Grand National
Assembly.
   ``Lukanov KGB spy!'' and ``Down with Communists!'' chanted the
jubilant crowd, estimated by police at up to 70,000. Many waved
blue flags of the main opposition alliance, while others uncorked
champagne bottles.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Smithsonian Institution curators are busy
cataloguing a monumental new collection of nearly 200 years of
popular American sheet music, including stacks of rare,
long-forgotten Broadway melodies by George Gershwin and Irving
Berlin.
   This bonanza from the nation's musical past, a gift from Fort
Wayne, Ind., broadcaster Sam deVincent, consists of 130,000
original editions of illustrated sheet music, nearly 20,000
recordings and boxes of posters, concert programs, newspaper
clippings and other memorabilia.
   ``This is one of the great, legendary collections of sheet music
in the world,'' said John Edward Hasse, curator of American music
at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. ``It
contains some of the rarest of the rare.''
   The scope of the deVincent collection is staggering. It ranges
from yellowing reprints of parlor piano pieces of the 1790s to
mournful Civil War ballads, the shameless bigotry of minstrel show
music, railroad songs and ragtime, military marches, antiwar
protest songs, Beatles favorites and political campaign choruses.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - People from Illinois to Arkansas are
divided over whether a climatologist's scientifically shaky
forecast of an earthquake during the next few days is cause to
party or reason to get all shook up.
   In some places, schools are closing. Disaster drills are being
staged. Sales of bottled water, canned food and earthquake
insurance have jumped.
   ``I think we have everything in place,'' said Elaine Van Horn of
Memphis, a believer whose family joined 11 others to put up a
stockpile of emergency food and camping gear. ``We've been working
on this probably since about August.''
   Others are amused.
   A rock band called the Rhythm Hounds planned a ``Shake, Rattle
and Quake'' night Sunday at the P&amp;H Cafe, a Memphis beer hall. A
pub called Zinnie's East advertised half-price specials Monday at
an ``It's Your Fault Earthquake Party.''

<HEAD>PBS Special Marks 15th Anniversary of MacNeil-Lehrer Reports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On Judgment Day, after the angel Gabriel has
sounded his horn and the seas are merrily a-boil, some PBS viewers
probably will tune in ``The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' for a sober,
reasoned, in-depth report.
   And there, of course, will be co-anchors Jim Lehrer and Robert
MacNeil calmly popping questions at bemused-looking Matthew, Mark
and - in Washington - Luke and John.
   ``Yes,'' the Canadian MacNeil will say with characteristic
aplomb, ``but what exactly does this mean in terms of, say, the
afterlife?''
   Well, maybe not.
   But tonight's 90-minute PBS special marking the 15th anniversary
of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' helps explain how and why the
two men became the longest-lived news team on television, winning
five Peabody awards, four Emmys and dozens of other awards along
the way.
   It also reveals human sides of two very smart, funny, creative
fellows.
   Lehrer, we learn, is the author of five novels and several
plays. MacNeil, the author of four non-fiction books, said he's
just finished the rough draft of his first novel. ``Just to keep up
with him is something,'' MacNeil said.
   We also learn that the two men, despite working in a business
known for oversized egos and bitter internecine rivalries, are each
other's best friend.
   ``We are in many ways each other's closest friend,'' said
MacNeil. ``It is wonderful to have somebody you can tell most
everything and be completely candid with. We are business partners
and friends.'' MacNeil also noted that each has named the other as
guardian of his children.
   Their nightly news show began here Oct. 20, 1975, as a local
program called ``The Robert MacNeil Report.'' It supplemented
commercial TV news by covering a single story each night, in depth,
with Lehrer as Washington correspondent.
   By 1976, the show was offered to all PBS stations and became
``The MacNeil-Lehrer Report,'' with Lehrer as co-anchor. In 1983,
it became the only hour-long, national nightly newscast.
   ``When we expanded to the hour, it changed from being a
supplement to an alternative,'' Lehrer said. ``Now we take the
position that if you're looking for a place to go every 24 hours
and find out what's happened and get some in-depth treatment, we're
the place,'' he said.
   MacNeil and Lehrer got to that place from vastly disparate
backgrounds.
   MacNeil, nicknamed ``Robin,'' a former Reuters rewrite man, went
to work for the BBC in 1967 after seven years as a NBC
correspondent and anchor. He joined the now-defunct National Public
Affairs Center for Television in 1971.
   Lehrer, a longtime Dallas newspaperman and former city editor of
the Dallas Times Herald, got into public television as on-air host
and editor of Dallas public TV station KERA's nightly news.
   Lehrer, a public affairs coordinator for PBS, first met MacNeil
in Atlanta in 1972. Neither man recalls the particulars of that
meeting. ``I think I called him `Bob,' '' Lehrer admits.
   The man who finally got them together on the air was Richard
Nixon. MacNeil and Lehrer's Emmy-winning coverage of the Senate
Watergate hearings in 1973 was their first professional
collaboration.
   When that stint ended, they agreed that there was an audience
for in-depth television news on PBS.
   ``It was clear that the American people were depending on
television more and more for news and public affairs on which to
base their votes and their opinions,'' Lehrer said.
   ``If they were going to depend on television for that, it was
incumbent on those of us who worked in public television to give
them that,'' he said.
   Lehrer said there are plans to refine their 15-year-old nightly
news show, including a new fixture called ``Conversations,'' a
12-minute interview segment with a person in the news.
   Would those refinements include showing more of MacNeil and
Lehrer than just the head and shoulders?
   ``I don't think we're going to go that far,'' Lehrer allowed.
``We think the public has already seen the best we have to offer.''

   Perry Farrell doesn't want his lyrics to be
overanalyzed. HE's adamant about it. In fact, if the hyperkinetic
singer of Jane's ADdiction were to have a motto, it would be:
``That's for me to know and you to find out.''
   Farrell's evasiveness about the exact subject matter of his
material can be exasperating. But whether he is that way because he
is trying to maintain artistic integrity or is just trying to be
enigmatic is a mystery.
their own conclusions without his help. So he reduced the band's
seeming complexity to basic terms.
   ``I write down what gets me off,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``There's very little rational thought. I don't want to
come off sounding like a fool or a simpleton, but I don't think
that hard on purpose.
   ``I simply just do it. I jot it down and then if it's good, it's
good, and if it's not, I try and fix it. Most of it is
subconscious, but I don't want you to think I don't think - maybe
I'm more impulsive than I am intellectual.''
have caused controversy since the start of their career.
   The cover art on the 1988 LP ``Nothing's Shocking'' features two
nude lifesize sculptures, joined at the waist, of singer Perry
Farrell's girlfriend, Casey. A banal look is painted on their faces
and their heads are aflame. Farrell created the sculpture.
   Eight of the nation's major record distribution chains refused
to carry the album. Later that year, all but two agreed to
distribute the record.
   Now, Jane's ADdiction's second release, ``Ritual de lo
HAbitual,'' has caused a similar furor. The cover art this time
depicts a fetish made up of sculptures of Farrell, CAsey and their
late friend, Xiola, all nude, lying on a bed surrounded by various
objects including Tarot cards, burning candles and photographs.
   Again, distributors said they would not put out the album as it
was, s Farrell created an alternative - a plain white cover with a
lengthy dissertation on freedom of speech. Some record stores carry
the original, some carry the white-covered version.
   But JAne's ADdiction is not explicit for the sake of being so -
look beyond the covers and see that Farrell's lyrics are brutally
Honest accounts of drug-addicted friends, bigotry and the general
deterioration of society set in a base of neo-psychedelic guitar.
   Farrell's reasons for his album covers are simple: He likes
nudity. ``It's just something that I enjoy looking at, basically. I
don't think it's very controversial.''
   ``Ritual'' is a bit more low-key musically than its predecessor,
But its subjects are as biting as ever. The erotic ``Three Days''
is Farrell's discourse on the three natures of sexuality human
beings are capable of - bisexuality, homosexuality and
heterosexuality.
   Farrell is always looking to expand his understanding of the
human condition. He praises women in ``Classic Girl'' and
empathizes the pain an interracial couple can face in ``No One's
Leaving.''
   In the liner notes on the white-covered ``Ritual,'' he even
writes: ``I used to wish sometimes that Igiving of love is fearless.''
   ``If I had been born female,'' he said, ``I would feel a little
bit like I was starting from somewhat of a disadvantage. Although,
on the other side of the coin, there's no one more powerful than a
woman. A beautiful woman can just rip a man's heart out.''
   Farrell has a striking eye for detail and specifics in his
lyrics. IN ``Of Course,'' he tells of his big brother holding onto
his hands and ``making me slap my own face.'' Of the incident, he
sings: ``He was trying to teach me something.''
   ``Most of the songs that are general are simply a style of
writing,'' he said. ``It's a great style of writing, but it's very
Hard for me to find generalities to write about.''
   Farrell, along with guitarist David Navarro, bassist Eric A, and
drummer Stephen Perkins, released their first self-titled album in
1987 on the independent XXX label.
   Jane's Addiction doesn't look back on its past work and try to
better it - instead, each album, even each song, is completely unto
itself.
   ``I don't go and interpret that it (a song) needs more of this
or that,'' Farrell said. ``EVery song's an original thing. I don't
try to change things up for change's sake, because I think that
might defeat the purpose of the song.

<HEAD>Philippines Gains Reputation as Hollywood of the FAr EAst</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philippines is becoming a budget
Hollywood, attracting foreign filmmakers despite deteriorating
security and more than its share of natural disasters.
   James Glickenhaus, producer, director and writer of ``McBain,''
said varied locations, a professional local work crew and an
English-speaking population also make filming here easier.
   ``All in all, it was an extremely attractive place for us to
shoot,'' GLickenhaus, 40, said. ``I would recommend it to other
film makers. It's a great place to shoot.''
   ``McBAin,'' scheduled for completion this month, is the latest
in a series of foreign movies filmed here. Others include
``Apocalypse Now,'' ``Platoon,'' ``BOrn on the Fourth of July,''
``The Year of Living Dangerously'' and Chuck Norris' ``DElta
Force'' series.
   The cheap cost of production in the Philippines could become an
even more attractive lure for leading moviemakers, particularly
because some of the biggest Hollywood film studios are now
foreign-owned.
   Just last week, for example, MCA Inc., parent of UNiversal
studios, was purchased by Matsushita, a leading Japanese
electronics conglomerate. The Japanese have promised to give MCA
creative independence, but are expected to look for economical ways
to control production expenses.
   ``McBain'' stars Christopher Walken, who won an Academy Award in
1973 for ``The Deer Hunter,'' and Venezuelan actress Maria Conchita
Alonzo, whose credits include ``Moscow on the Hudson'' with Robin
Williams and ``Running Man'' with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
   Glickenhaus downplayed apprehensions about the security
situation in the country, which faces a 21-year-old communist
rebellion and the continuing threat from military extremists who
have launched seven armed uprisings in the past five years.
   ``IF you read the papers in New York, you'd think it is unsafe
and you're going to be shot and you're gonna be blown up,''
Glickenhaus said. ``Obviously, when you're here, I don't think, I
don't feel that I'm going to be shot or blown up.''
as a mutiny led by a renegade army colonel erupted in th southern
Philippines, 500 miles south of here.
   The rebellion fizzled in three days.
   A series of at least 40 bombing attacks by rightist and leftist
extremists have occurred in the Manila area since August.
   Early in November, Typhoon MIke swept the central Philippines,
killing about 470 people.
   Walken said foreign members of the film were unaffected by these
incidents since they took place in areas far away from where they
were filming.

   GLickenhaus said he used several provinces just on the outskirts
of Manila to shoot scenes that depict parts of three countries.

nearby Cavite province depicted a Vietnamese prison camp.
   Just west of MAnila, the film crew built a Jamaican white sand
beach resort in the coast of Zambales province.
most of whom worked in Hollywood films shot here.
   The high cost of production back home, especially for
independent American film producers working on a tight budget,
makes shooting in the Philippines attractive.
   Glickenhaus said ``McBain,'' if shot in the United States, would
have cost at least double its $17 million budget.
   HEof extras were storming the COlombian presidential palace. That
scene would have cost $2 million if shot in Hollywood.
   Tom Gray, the film's publicist, said the widespread use of
English - one of the two official languages - gives the Philippines
an advantage over other Southeast Asian countries.
   He said it is easy to give directions to Filipino actors and
crew members because they understand English.
   ``People still like making movies here,'' Glickenhaus said.
``That's a good thing.''

   When Mary Hoffman joined the Army during World
War II, she was a serious young woman who thought she'd already
missed her chance for a full life. But the Women's Auxiliary Army
Corps changed everything.
   ``I thought I was going to be a spinster,'' she recalled 47
years later. ``Instead, I married my first bedside patient.''
   Mrs. Hoffman is one of the 350,000 women who served in World War
II. She is also the largest single donor to the foundation that's
trying to build a memorial to America's women veterans. Mrs.
Hoffman has contributed more than $60,000 to the project, all from
disability payments she received after breast cancer forced her to
leave the service in 1945.
   Mrs. Hoffman, now an 83-year-old widow, says women veterans need
their own memorial.
   Male war veterans have their monuments and memorials, but ``we
are the last group to unite,'' she said from her home in
Hyattsville, Md. ``I do feel it's so well worth it.''
   Mrs. Hoffman spent two years in the WAC as an occupational
therapist, stationed at Woodrow Wilson Hospital in Staunton, Va.
Her job was to go from bedside to bedside, helping injured soldiers
make wallets or belts or teaching them to type or knit.
   ``I didn't have a sense of humor when I first went into the
military,'' she remembered. ``I was a little old-fashioned, wearing
my hair up. But the Army made me over, believe me.''
   Mrs. Hoffman's small story is one of almost 50,000 collected so
far for a databank that will be part of the memorial, said retired
U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. Wilma Vaught, president of the Women in
the Military Service of America Foundation.
   Vaught is delighted with Mrs. Hoffman's generosity. But she
needs a total of $25 million for the memorial and at the moment,
she's about $22.5 million short.
   ``There are over 1.2 million living women veterans and 400,000
women on active duty and in the Guard and reserve'' who are
potential donors, Vaught said in a recent interview at the
foundation's Arlington, Va., offices.
   Part of Vaught's problem is finding those women, as well as the
descendants of the thousands of American women who served in every
war since the Revolution - as nurses, scouts, suppliers, soldiers
and saboteurs.
   Privacy laws prevent Vaught from getting the addresses of
veterans or active-duty military women from the government. She has
been relying on some 450 volunteers to find them.
   The Women in Military Service Memorial also suffered a
fund-raising setback this year. The foundation tried to raffle a $1
million house in suburban Centreville, Va., only to see ticket
sales fall far below target.
   ``We saw this as a mechanism that in a really short period of
time we could raise a lot of money,'' Vaught said.
   But the kickoff coincided with the drug trial of D.C. Mayor
Marion Barry, and media attention was nominal, she said.
   When the date for the drawing approached in early November, the
foundation had sold only about 24,000 of the one million raffle
tickets printed. Vaught was forced to postpone the drawing until
Feb. 23.
   There's been progress in other areas. The site has been chosen:
the ceremonial entrance gate to Arlington National Cemetery. The
foundation conducted a design competition last year and selected a
concept by Marion G. Weiss and Michael Manfredi, partners in a New
York architecture firm.
   Their design sets 10 39-foot glass spires into the top of the
semicircular gate, known as the Hemicycle. Inside the entrance
walls will be a museum portraying the history of women in the U.S.
military, a 225-seat auditorium, and the databank.
   At night, the spires will be gently lit, giving the effect of
candles against the Virginia hillside.
   Vaught is very conscious that time is essential. Under the law
authorizing the memorial, Vaught has until November 1991 to raise
the $25 million.
   ``That date may be a little optimistic,'' she said, adding that
she is prepared to go back to Congress to ask for more time.
   Meanwhile, as she travels the country meeting women veterans and
promoting the memorial, she is most impressed by the World War I
veterans.
   ``We still have a few World War I women left who can make it to
the dedication,'' she said. ``If we're going to do something to say
thank-you to them, it's got to be now.''

<HEAD>Could Paper Stock Certificates Go the Way of Silent Movies, TV
Tubes?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are exploring ways to
streamline the process for getting stocks to the buyer and payment
to the seller - including a reform to replace paper stock
certificates with computerized listings.
   But investors who feel more comfortable holding on to those
intricately engraved, diploma-sized pieces of paper may not have to
swap them for a line on a blinking computer screen.
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden
says he supports the goal of cutting the completion time of stock
trades from five days to three but ``it is my strong desire to
preserve'' investors' rights to choose between a tangible stock
certificate and an electronic record.
   At a round-table discussion last week with industry leaders,
Breeden and other SEC officials heard several alternatives for
accelerating the process of clearance and settlement.
   Simply put, clearance and settlement is the system for clearing
the transfer of securities going in one direction and money moving
in the other in an orderly way to settle a transaction.
   ``Although it typically operates unseen and unnoticed by the
average investor, the clearance and settlement system is the
essential infrastructure that supports the operation of the more
visible elements of our capital markets,'' Breeden said.
   But he also said that while the U.S. clearance and settlement
system processes $469 billion in securities transactions each day,
it still takes five business days to settle a transaction here
while some foreign markets do it in three days or less.
   Anyone who's ever had to wait for their bank to clear an
out-of-state check knows the problems delay can cause.
   Stock transactions are complicated by the physical transfer of a
check or cash to the seller and the paper stock certificates to the
buyer. Multiply that by millions of shares worth billions of
dollars on a busy trading day and the risk of delayed clearance and
settlement becomes apparent.
   Three clearinghouses and three depositories handle the money and
stock transfers for all of the nation's seven stock exchanges.
   During the 1987 stock market crash the system was overwhelmed,
tying up large amounts of cash that could have kept the trading
process more fluid.
   Experts worry that in a market emergency, the value of
securities could rise or fall before trades are completed, causing
missed opportunities and losses on a massive scale and possibly
leading - if the problems are serious enough - to defaults and a
chain reaction collapse in the increasingly interdependent markets.
   Recent reform legislation passed by Congress and signed by the
president calls for the SEC and other federal regulators to work
out ways of improving clearance and settlement systems for stock,
bonds, futures contracts and options which are now handled
separately.
   The Group of 30, a London-based, private-sector group composed
of international business and financial leaders pushing for ways to
unify the the clearance and settlement process worldwide.
   One method discussed at the round table is the replacement of
stock certificates with a so-called ``book entry'' in a computer.
   Some countries, such as Japan, have done away with the use of
stock certificates but some retail brokerages fear that without
paper documents they might lose the mom and pop investors that are
their mainstay.
   ``Many of our retail customers enjoy the right to take physical
possession of their certificates,'' maintains A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons,
a St. Louis-based brokerage. ``Some customers tend to distrust any
entity holding their certificates.''
   Elimination of stock certificates is also opposed, not
surprisingly, by the people who make the intricately engraved
certificates.
   A survey commissioned by the United States Banknote Corp., one
of the nation's largest private printers of stamps, banknotes and
stock certificates, found that four out of five shareholders
queried opposed the proposed plan for eliminating stock
certificates.
   The survey of 750 individuals currently investing in th market
found that 81 percent opposed replacing stock certificates with a
book entry only system of computerized record-keeping.
   Also opposing the proposal is the United Shareholders
Association, a shareholders rights group founded in 1986 by
takeover strategist T. Boone Pickens.
   ``Certificates represent perhaps the most direct link between
corporations and their shareholders. By depriving shareholders of
this certificate, a book entry only system would create one more
gap between management and ownership,'' USA President Ralph V.
Whitworth wrote Breeden recently.
   Breeden said he favored a ``pro-choice'' alternative: allowing
investors who want to, to keep their certificates but encouraging
the use of speedier electronic methods.
   But small brokerages fret that giving investors a choice would
be too expensive to maintain and could drive them out of business.
   ``We have heard a great deal from our regional and smaller firms
who are very concerned about the cost-benefit analysis,'' said
Edward Kwalwasser, a New York Stock Exchange official.
   George McNamee, chairman of First Albany Corp. said he strongly
supported cutting the settlement process to three days but feared
the additional cost ``only will be offset if we eliminate the
certificates.''

   The death threat was nothing new to the
rubber tappers' union in this Amazon town.
   ``I've been hired to kill you,'' read a scrawled note slipped
under the office door in November. It said three union leaders and
the local's truck driver ``can't make it to 1991.''
   The note was unsigned, but there was little doubt at union
headquarters who was behind it: cattle ranchers, the tappers'
enemies in a bloody dispute for land rights in Brazil's tropical
rain forest.
   Since the union was founded in 1975, such threats have been
common and deadly serious. The local says ``pistoleiros,'' gunmen
hired by landowners, have killed more than 150 tappers and Indians.
   One victim was CHico Mendes, a rubber tapper and union leader
who had become an internationally consulted expert on the Amazon.
Shotgun fire from ambush cut him down in December 1988 at his home
in Xapuri, near the Bolivian border 2,650 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   A local rancher, Darli Alves da Silva, and his son Darci were
arrested. Their trial is scheduled to begin Wednesday in Xapuri.
   ``This is the land where they threaten and do it,'' said
Osmarino AMancio Rodrigues, president of the Brasileia union local
And one of those on the note's list. ``No one has ever escaped.''
   He added, with a laugh: ``Two of my bodyguards were threatened.
Now I'll have to get bodyguards for my bodyguards.''
   Rodrigues, 34, is widely regarded as the successor to Chico
Mendes as the leader of a grass-roots movement against destruction
of the rain forest.
   Jose da SIlva Pereira, another tapper on the death list, said:
``When ranchers want to get rid of a tapper, they come in shooting,
kill his livestock and burn his house. If he doesn't leave, he
dies.''
   A new alliance of rubber tappers and Amazon Indians is
challenging the notion that ``developing'' the forest means cutting
it down for timber or burning it to make pasture.
   Uncontrolled slash-and-burn clearing already has destroyed more
than 250,000 square miles of rain forest, an area the equal to
Texas. A patch of jungle the size of a football field disappears
every eight seconds, adding to the greenhouse effect that is
warming the planet.
   Those whose livelihoods come from the forest favor an
alternative called ``extractivist reserves,'' a new system of
landholding in which the government expropriates rain forest to
allow commercial harvesting of fruits, nuts and other renewable
products.
   Such reserves give tappers legal rights to the jungle, where for
years they were squatters on the huge feudal estates of cattle
barons and big landowners. The government now has 7{ million acres
of reserves in AMazonia and plans to set aside 55 million more by
1993.
   ONe region of nearly 2{ million acres is named for Chico Mendes.
   ``There won't be peace in the forest without land reform,'' said
Rodrigues, a short, swarthy man with a black beard. ``In Amazonia,
that means Indian reservations and extractivist reserves.''
   The main argument for protecting the forest is simply that it's
More profitable alive.
   Aminded consumers in the United States and Europe. Amazon fruits,
nuts, oils and essences are heading north to make everything from
ice cream and nut candy to cosmetics.
   ``We have to prove the economic value of the rain forest and
generate income to save it,'' anthropologist Jason Clay said in an
interview. Clay is research director of Cultural Survival, a
non-profit group based in Cambridge, Mass., and visits Brazil
frequently.
   Cultural SUrvival buys jungle products and resells them to
companies abroad, charging a 5 percent ``environmental premium''
used to help forest peoples.
   Clay said he showed samples of 350 rain forest products and
businessmen were interested in 38 of them. He reported orders worth
$4 million, and said several companies pledged part of their
profits to rain forest projects.
   Extractivist reserves are ``one of the few environmentally
viable alternatives for the Amazon,'' he said.
   ``We have to make the reserves more economically rewarding. Then
we can use them to recover degraded areas and as buffer zones for
the genetic hotspots, the really fragile parts of Amazonia that
shouldn't be used.''
   Brazil has tried for decades to tap the riches of the Amazon, a
wilderness of two million square miles that is larger than Europe
without the Soviet Union.
   Amazonia contains 30 percent of the world's rain forest;
one-fifth of its fresh water; 5 million species of plants, animals
and insects, and rich deposits of gold, diamonds, iron, tin and
other minerals. Despite those riches, most of its inhabitants live
in grinding poverty.
   Attempts by the military regime of 1964-1985 to ``open up the
Amazon'' were an ecological nightmare.
   Huge development projects like the Trans-Amazon highway, farm
settlements and the Balbina and Tucurui hydroelectric dams wiped
out huge tracts of forest and nearly destroyed some native tribes.
   Government incentives attracted cattle ranchers, who kept
burning the jungle off the sandy soil to replace pasture that
lasted only two or three years. Experts say their productivity is Secretary
Jose Lutzenberger, an internationally
respected ecologist, says Brazil is trying to change its image as a
destroyer of the environment.
   ``Extractivist reserves are extremely important,'' he said in an
interview. ``We must create many more of them.''
   Canada has pledged $10 million to the National Rubber Tappers
Council, starting next year, to develop extractivist reserves.
   THe newest and largest of the special areas is the Chico Mendes
REserve, which covers 2.4 million acres in the western Amazon state
of Acre, where the most violence has occurred.
   On the reserves, tappers' associations sign long-term contracts
with the government for the ``use and benefit'' of the land. They
must obey rules for protecting the environment or forfeit the area.
   ``This was our great victory,'' said Nelson Custodio da Silva, a
rubber tapper. ``We fought four years for this reserve.''
   Problems remain. Most reserves have not yet been expropriated
and the government foresees a long legal battle with landowners.
The Chico Mendes Reserve was created by former President Jose
Sarney three days before he left office in March.
   ``It was a great party, but the bill wasn't paid,'' Marco
Antonio Mendes, the Acre state environment secretary, said in an
interview.
   Tappers also have not escaped exploitation by ``marreteiros'' -
middlemen who trade commercial goods like salt and cloth for rubber
and nuts, and routinely charge three or four times the regular
price.
   Nearly all the profit from jungle produce is made elsewhere.
Tappers earn only 3 to 4 cents a pound for Brazil nuts, about 2
percent of the New York wholesale price.
   Acre state's Technology Foundation is running a unique
experiment in forest management on the remote border with Amazonas
state.
   At the 166,000-acre Antimari reserve, technicians are studying
how to ``densify'' the forest by planting without upsetting the
natural balance. They are concentrating on bamboo, timber and more
than 800 types of medicinal plants, as well as rubber and Brazil
nuts.
   ``This is a first for Amazonia,'' said Gilberto Siqueira, the
foundation president. ``It will show us the limits of exploitation
without disturbing the whole.''
   Another experimental project is a cooperative in Xapuri that
shells, packs and exports Brazil nuts. It is the first
nut-processing plant owned by the tappers.
paid a fair price,'' said Rolando Polanco, a worker at the
cooperative. ``We're trying to give the tappers a better deal.''
   The plant, built with a $25,000 gift from Cultural Survival,
employs 78 people and processes 1,100 pounds of nuts a day, barely
one-tenth of the production in Xapuri alone. Polanco said expansion
depends on donations from environmental groups and businessmen.

   Joao de Almeida Mello sat on his cabin
floor in the rain forest and recalled when he lived in fear of
expulsion, or worse, by landowners.
   ``I was just a squatter,'' he said. ``I was at the mercy of
ranchers. I had no security, no guarantees.''
   ``Living on your own land makes all the difference,'' he said,
and smiled.
   Mello is a rubber tapper on the Chico Mendes Extractivist
Reserve in the western Amazon state of Acre, nearly 3,000 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Extractivist reserves are a new model of development for the
Amazon: The government gives forest dwellers rights to their
traditional lands and lets them harvest what the jungle grows.
rubber and nuts that provide his income, for wood to build and game
to help feed his wife and 10 children.
   His day starts at 4:00 a.m., when the rubber-tree sap flows
freely in the cool of the morning. It slows when the Amazon sun
pushes the heat to or through the 90s.
   ON this morning, he crossed a meadow and entered the forest,
walking on a carpet of broad, dark leaves that covered the sandy
soil. Bird songs filled the woods, the loudest of them the
three-whistle tune of what forest people call the ``twenty-one.''
   Walking among 1,500-year-old Brazil-nut and piqui trees towering
130 feet, MELlo approached a shiny-leafed rubber tree, drew his
tapping knife and gently cut half a dozen diagonal slashes on the
already scarred trunk.
   Milky white latex began to flow, dripping into a hollowed
Brazil-nut pod the size of a softball propped on a three-pronged
stick. Mello moved to the next tree.
   This trail contains about 150 trees, and he will tap them all in
a day. Mello has five trails in the forest and works them in turn.
   He retraces the route later to collect the latex, dumping it
into a large, round can he carries in a cloth harness on his back.
At the cabin, he empties the contents into a homemade wooden press,
where the latex congeals into rubber.
sugar-cane liquor and other goods at exorbitant prices. Sugar that
costs 20 cents a pound in a store often costs four times that at
barter time.
   ``The bill just keeps growing and you never finish paying,''
said Mello, sitting on a split-log bench in his cabin. The room was
bare except for three oiled shotguns hanging by their straps from
nails on the wall.
   COllecting latex is difficult during the rainy season from
December to April and tappers gather Brazil nuts instead. Mello
collects the pods in a backpack made of vines, cracks them open and
leaves the nuts in flour sacks along the rutted dirt road that
leads out of the reserve.
   He and other tappers pool their money to rent a tractor and take
the nuts outside the reserve to sell, thus avoiding the middlemen.
Tappers deeper in the forest rely on ox cart and burro to get
through the mud.
   Mello said he earned only 50,000 cruzeiros last year, less than
$1,000 in Brazil's rapidly devaluating currency.
the reserve are less economic than political - land rights and the
freedom to unionize.
   To help feed the family, Mello plants rice, beans and manioc
root. He sells what is left over.
   Meat often means monkey, armadillo or parrot. Now and then, he
slaughters a goat or a pig.
   Government environmental workers plan to build a dam near
Mello's cabin so he can raise fish.
   They also teach those who live in the reserves how to renew
degraded parts of the forest by planting avocado, cashew, orange,
Tangerine and acai trees.
   ``We used to ruin a lot of the forest and the second growth
wasn't good for anything,'' Mello said. ``Now it's full of fruit
trees.''
   There still is no school, although Mello's district has 40
school-age children. The reserve has no health station, despite
Government promises to build one.
   ``We get promises, promises and nothing is done,'' said Mello's
neighbor, Raimundo Tavares Ribeiro. ``If you get sick, either a
group of neighbors carries you out in a hammock to a hospital or
you stay there and die.''
   STill, he said, the reserve has freed tappers from their
greatest fear: the ranchers and big landowners.
   ``The landowners keep you under their feet,'' Tavares said. ``If
you work for them, you're a slave. They pay you what they want and
take half of what you grow.''
   ``Reserves give poor people conditions to work,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Romanians have achieved a fragile
democracy a year after the bloody fall of communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, but not the prosperity and calm they hoped it
would bring.
   There is economic misery as the government tries to create a
market economy, and suspicion of political leaders who once served
Ceausescu.
   An army of orphaned or abandoned children is warehoused in
woeful institutions. There are nagging questions about attitudes
toward minority Hungarians here in Transylvania, and toward Jews
and Gypsies.
   Even the revolution, which began in this western city, is under
a cloud. Some question whether it was really a revolution or just a
communist palace coup.
   ``The government that has installed itself in Bucharest is
neo-communist, using the same people, methods, and even massacres,
as the one before,'' said George Serban, an anti-government
activist.
   He displayed a ripped-open envelope to emphasize his claim that
someone still reads his mail and taps his telephone.
   Demonstrators who join weekly street protests apparently see
nothing contradictory in accusing the new National Salvation Front
government of being a front for unreformed communists and
criticizing the market-oriented reforms of Premier Petre Roman.
   Prices have doubled or tripled, stores are empty, industrial
production is down 20 percent and the average monthly paycheck is
worth only $20 on the black market.
   In nationwide protests Nov. 15, more than 100,000 Romanians
demanded the government's resignation.
   The revolution began at a corner building that served as the
Hungarian Reformed Church and housed its pastor, Laszlo Tokes. It
is about half a mile from where Serban, the 37-year-old president
of the anti-government Timisoara Society, spoke recently to a human
rights conference.
   It was Dec. 15, 1989. Hundreds of people gathered outside as
Tokes, whose defiant anti-communism had made him a marked man,
waited for Ceausescu's police to banish him to the far-off village
of Mineu.
   Communists had been swept from power the previous month in
Czechoslovakia. Radical changes were occuring in the other former
East bloc countries, but Ceausescu promised only more of the same.
   ``There was something in the air, a feeling that this could not
continue, and it was in that atmosphere that the people gathered
outside the church,'' said Lajos Varga, a member of the
congregation and a close friend of Tokes.
   Demonstrators moved to the downtown Communist Party
headquarters, smashed windows and set fires inside. Police invaded
the church, beat Tokes and took him away. The revolution had begun.
   ``First, the army fired on demonstrators gathered again outside
the party building,'' Varga recalled. ``Several dozen were killed
that afternoon as the army pushed demonstrators down the main
boulevard, leaving a few dead at each junction.''
   Tension spread to Bucharest, and Ceausescu organized a mass
rally several days later to condemn the ``hooligans'' in Timisoara.
   For the first time in his 24 years of power, a booing crowd
drowned him out. Police and soldiers began shooting.
   Bogdan Preda, an Associated Press reporter, was in University
Square.
   ``I jumped into a fountain outside the nearby architecture
school building, and that may have saved my life,'' he recalled.
``Eventually, we escaped through the southern end of the main
boulevard, which the police and army kept open.''
   Ceausescu fled the next day, Dec. 22, but was captured by the
army, which had turned against him. He was tried secretly and
executed on Christmas Day.
   The National Salvation Front stepped in, began running the
country and rode its promise of painless reform to easy victory in
Romania's first free elections in five decades.
   Many people accuse the front of usurping their revolution.
   President Ion Iliescu, a top Communist official before falling
out with Ceausescu, passionately defended communism in his first
television speech after the uprising. Iliescu now insists he no
longer believes in it.
   Last spring, students, intellectuals, former dissidents and
others blocked traffic in University Square for 53 days. Six people
were killed when police tried to suppress the protest.
   Iliescu called in pro-government miners from the provinces. They
terrorized the capital for days, beating and arresting people
suspected of opposing the government.
   Other countries shunned Romania after the violence, but it has
recovered some foreign support by backing U.N. sanctions against
Iraq at the cost of billions of dollars in trade.
   Intellectuals have increased their attacks on Iliescu since the
passage of laws placing the army, the new Romanian Intelligence
Service and even the government under his direct control and
supervision.
   ``Iliescu is a potential dictator, and he must be stopped,''
said Gabriel Andreescu of the intellectual Group for Social
Dialogue, a cornerstone of the nationwide Civic Alliance
opposition.
   The alliance accuses Iliescu and the National Salvation Front of
covering up what happened in the revolution.
   No one is being tried for the random shooting that occurred in
Bucharest for several days between Ceausescu's flight and his
execution. Most of the more than 1,000 people killed in the
revolution lost their lives in that period.
   About 6,000 members of Ceausescu's Securitate security service
have turned up in the new intelligence service. The 9,000 others,
along with members of the Communist Party Central Committee, were
retired with pensions.
   Although about 60 Ceausescu aides and Securitate officers have
been tried, the charges addressed only Ceausescu's attempt to
repress the revolt, not the violence after his flight.
   Most Romanians appear satisfied with the freedoms introduced
last December and are eager to improve their lot after four decades
of increasing poverty under communism, but Roman's reforms have
begun to bite.
   Under the economic program's first phase, introduced Nov. 1,
many prices have risen by up to 200 percent. Staple foods, energy
and rents remain protected, but only temporarily.
   Money-losing state enterprises have been told they face
bankruptcy and the government has said it will stop providing
industry with cheap energy while private homes are dark and cold.
   The program has made enemies in the trade unions, which
officials see as potentially the strongest opposition force.
   In a sign of possible divisions in the Front itself, Iliescu has
been lukewarm about Roman's reforms, which the premier says will
deliver ``an average European standard of living'' in five years.
   Doru Mihiti of the Timisoara Society summed up the views of the
critics:
   ``There was a moment in which communism could have been
eliminated for good in Romania. In the chaos right after the
revolution, the entire system and its personnel could have been
overhauled. Instead, we now must fight for the changes, slowly, and
one at a time.''

   Uncertainty about what happened to the
Nicolae Ceausescu's hated secret police, the Securitate, has cast a
shadow over the revolution.
   Despite official accounting for about 9,000 Securitate officers
who were retired or transferred to other jobs, many Romanians
believe the organization is alive and well, playing its old game of
political terror and intrigue for new masters.
   Virgil Magureanu, chief of the new Romanian Intelligence
Service, acknowledges hiring nearly 6,000 ``uncompromised''
Securitate officers for what he termed non-political duties.
   Many critics of the government claim agents of the new service
infiltrate opposition demonstrations, collect information that
later leads to arrests, and occasionally try to provoke violence.
   ``The political police still exists, and we will not have
liberty until it is gone,'' Sorin Rosca of the Civic Alliance
opposition declared at a recent anti-government demonstration.
   Anxiety about the Securitate derives partially from the
continuing mystery surrounding the revolution of December 1989.
   More than 1,000 Romanians were killed, most of them after
Ceausescu fell Dec. 22 and the National Salvation Front government
was installed. Ceausescu loyalists from Securitate fought the army
and shot citizens down in the streets.
   Who ordered and carried out the shootings still is not known,
and no one has been tried. The issue is being avoided in the trial
of the former Securitate chief, Iulian Vlad.
   Thousands of people were arrested during violence accompanying
the revolution, but officials say they were released in the
confusion and there was no record of their names.
   Sen. Dan Iosif, a front member who led the occupation of
Ceausescu's former headquarters in Palace Square, said Securitate
agents captured there were either killed by the raiders or
eliminated by other Securitate members to keep them quiet.
   President Ion Iliescu, when asked in interviews, acknowledges
the existence of a ``very great mystery'' surrounding the uprising.
   In a society where decades of government-controlled media
transformed word-of-mouth into the only alternative source of
information, holes in the official version have been filled by
rumors in dazzling variety.
   Some Romanians believe the new authorities gave the Securitate
amnesty in exchange for a cease-fire.
   Coriolan Sipos, one of those who stormed Ceausescu's
headquarters, offered this: ``It was a brilliant coup by the
Securitate itself to install Iliescu, pure and simple,''
   Sipos, a teacher, claimed many of those who invaded the building
had been been killed by plainclothes Securitate agents posing as
revolutionaries.
   ``Among those who survived, only about 10 are left in Romania,
the rest having been hounded out in one way or another,'' he said.
   Gabriel Andreescu of the intellectual Group for Social Dialogue
said: ``I do not rule out the possibility that the revolution was
entirely staged, however diabolical it seems, but all I can say for
certain is that the official story is false.''

   distorted world of Japanese real estate where less is more and more

   Many a tourist has wandered gape-mouthed through
Tokyo's Ginza, the shopping wonderland where such high-priced
marvels as $450 neckties confound the senses. Next to it, though,
lies a greater treasure.
   It is a vacant lot.
   For three years, this 53.4-acre asphalt wasteland in the heart
of the most expensive real estate in the world has gone virtually
unused.
government-owned former rail yard is surrounded by headquarters of
mighty banks and corporations. It is a jarring sight, somewhat as
Manhattan might look with an empty space where Rockefeller Center
now stands. Yet no one can buy it.
   To find out why entails a Lewis Carroll-like journey through
land policies that Western experts say defy economic logic and
absurdly inflate Tokyo's land prices, which run 30 to 100 times
Higher than in other major cities worldwide.
   Such government policies have left Japan's huge landholding
corporations swimming in assets and many homeowners paper
millionaires. But they have also created a large class of have-nots
that threatens JApan's prosperity.
   Government officials say they cannot put the Shiodome rail yard
on the market just yet because it is too valuable. The lot is as
much as 50 times pricier than the approximately $850 million
Japan's mitsubishi Estate Co. paid for a share of the 22-acre
Rockefeller Center last year.
   Its sudden availability to speculators would bid up real estate
prices to even more astronomical levels, officials say, although
they acknowledge that such a policy runs contrary to the law of
supply and demand.
   ``Normal economic theory doesn't seem to work when it comes to
land in Japan, because there is overwhelmingly more demand for land
than supply,'' said Hiroshi Yoneda, the Transportation MInistry
official in charge of the yard.
aghast at such reasoning.
   ``Raising supply usually lowers prices. Anyone who doesn't know
that should go back and take Economics 101,'' scoffed Robert
Feldman, an economist at Salomon Bros., a NEw York financial house.
   But this is Japan, where an alchemy of postwar tax policy, easy
money and Japanese ``herd'' behavior has turned land into gold.
   Like gold's fabled ability to inspire greed, the hunger for land
on this small archipelago crowded with 120 million people has
created rapacious speculators who've become the stuff of movies and
TV dramas.
   ``Land sharks'' eager to resell properties hire thugs who spend
Months banging noisemakers or setting fires to hound families from
buildings they've occupied for generations. Real estate executives
have been held hostage by extremists outraged over inadequate
housing.
   Worst of all, land fever has divided Japan into two economic
classes -- those who own land, usually through an inheritance, and
those who can't afford it. Too often, the landless are the younger,
baby-producing generation.
   That looms as a potential disaster. Japan had the world's lowest
birthrate last year at 10.2 babies per 1,000 people. In surveys,
many women attribute their unwillingness to have children in part
to the rented ``rabbit hutch'' apartments they must squeeze into
with little room for family.
   Ultimately, policy-makers worry, this so-called ``child shock''
could undermine the nation's industrial might. Japan, already
suffering a labor shortage, could become top-heavy with too many
elderly pensioners supported by too few younger workers.
   Up to now, the long-governing conservative Liberal Democratic
PArty has had little motivation to act. High land prices have been
popular with its major constituencies: the 60 percent of Japanese
who already own homes and the large corporations who have watched
their portfolio assets swell.
   But the catastrophic potential of the boom may nudge government
into action.
   On Oct. 30, a 1 percent tax on land holdings was suggested to
gradually to drive down prices. According to one survey, high
interest rates and an economic slowdown already have reduced
residential land prices by 10 percent to 30 percent in recent
months.
   The government is moving gingerly, fearful falling prices would
jolt corporations with large holdings of real estate and stocks.
Many are already reeling from the Tokyo Stock Exchange's nosedive
this year.
   In addition, the government must untangle 45 years of often
bizarre tax and lending policies that have made Tokyo a sea of
two-story homes instead of desperately needed high-rise
redevelopment.

years. Banks offer 100-year mortgages. Current landholding taxes
are only as high as 0.2 percent, allowing small owners to sit tight
and watch values spiral upward.
   As a result, real estate experts say, the main reason for the
land inflation is probably not a lack of space but simply that so
little is traded.
   Plans are also moving slowly for Shiodome, a remnant of the
government's 1987 sell-off of the state-owned railway to private
companies.
   Hiroshi Yoneda, the Transportation Ministry official charged
with developing a subdivision plan, said it is to be gradually sold
off for commercial use after March 1992. But that timetable may be
impossible.
   ``It is extraordinary. If they had disposed of Shiodome several
years ago that land would have soaked up so much speculative
money,'' said Gregory CLark, a Sophia University economics
professor who has advised the government on the land problem.
   ``They genuinely believe that by keeping a supply of land off
the market they lower prices,'' Clark said. ``If you look at the
situation with Western eyes you'd have to assume it was a
government plot'' to keep prices high.
   Some Westerners do. An article in the October issue of The
Atlantic Monthly, for example, accuses Japan's government of ``a
conscious and even a brilliant strategy'' to maintain sky-high land
prices as a means of keeping foreign companies from buying into
Japan, suppressing consumption of foreign goods and boosting
savings.
   Most experts conclude, however, there's no evidence for such a
scheme.
   Makoto Utsumi, vice minister of finance for international
affairs, looked surprised when asked whether his ministry was
behind it all, as some conspiracy theorists contend.
   ``It's totally wrong to think that Finance Ministry officials
are happy to see higher land prices,'' he retorted. Indeed, the
ministry has been urging banks to rein in real estate loans, but to
little avail.
   Clark said he would ``never rule out a plot entirely because
there are depths of this society we never get to.
   ``If it's a plot, they're very clever. If not, they're very
stupid. And I can't believe the Japanese are so stupid.''

   Consumer spending, the driving force behind
eight years of U.S. economic expansion, did not budge in October,
the government said in a report analysts contend was further
evidence of a recession.
   Accounting for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity,
consumer spending was unchanged from September at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $3.73 trillion, the Commerce Department
said Thursday.
   ``The consumer has retrenched,'' said economist Gilbert Benz of
the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. ``It clearly supports those who

<HEAD>FNN Owner Expects To Report $72.5 Million Loss for Fiscal 1990</HEAD>

   Financial News Network Inc., which operates a
busiess channel on cable television but is embroiled in a
financial controversy of its own, said it expects to report a $72.5
million loss for fiscal 1990.
   The company, whose biggest shareholder is the owner of the
United Press International wire service, also said Thursday it
expects to report a loss of $25 million for the first quarter of
its current fiscal year.
   The company has been unable to report its financial results for
the fiscal year ended June 30 because it replaced its auditing firm
in a controversy over how FNN was reporting a $28 million
investment in a new service.
   The auditors Deloitte &amp; Touche contended the investment should
have been deducted from quarterly earnings while FNN wanted to
spread the costs over a few years.
   Deloitte left as FNN's auditor in October and the firm Coopers &amp;
Lybrand was brought in to study the FNN annual financial
statements.
   FNN said Thursday that its new auditors had ``substantially
completed their examination'' and said it expects to file its
audited financial statements with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in early December.
   FNN said the anticipated net loss for the year would leave it
with a ``shareholders' deficit of approximately $33.5 million at
June 30.''
   The shareholders' deficit represents an excess of liabilities
over assets.
   The company said it would probably file amended quarterly
reports for the first nine months of fiscal 1990 to reflect
``material changes deemed appropriate as a result of the audit.''
   In addition, it said it expects to report within a few weeks a
$25 million loss for the first fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30.
   FNN said that more than half of the anticipated losses for the
year and the first quarter involves elimination of revenues derived
from affiliated businesses.
   The company did not identify the affiliates, but it is 46
percent owned by Infotechnology Inc., which owns United Press
International and an assortment of other media and technology
companies.
   It was disclosed last month that the SEC is investigating
Infotechnology for undisclosed reasons. Infotechnology and FNN have
each said they do not have enough cash flow to cover operating
expenses, and are negotiating with those to whom they owe money.
   In late October, Alan J. Hirschfield and Allan R. Tessler were
brought in to succeed Earl Brian as interim co-chief executives at
both Infotechnology and Financial News Network.
   In early November, they said they were putting the companies'
principal operations up for sale, including the FNN cable network
and UPI.
   In Thursday's announcement, Hirschfield and Tessler said FNN's
investment banker, Wertheim &amp; Schroder &amp; Co. Inc., is beginning the
sale process for FNN.
   ``A substantial number of inquires have been received from a
broad representation of media-related companies and others
concerning the proposed sale of FNN,'' the statement said.
   Ms. Gordon said she could not identify who was interested or how
many inquiries had been received. She said the company hopes to
conclude negotiations of the contracts for the sales by the end of
the year.
   FNN provides stock quotes, business and financial news and
sports information on a cable TV network to more than 35 million
homes served by 3,500 cable systems in the United States and
Canada.
   It also operates a business radio network and with
Infotechnology, owns 51 percent of the cable network, The Learning
Channel.

<HEAD>McDonald's Tests Mexican Menu Item</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If you can test pizzas at McDonald's
restaurants in Kentucky and try out a '50s-style diner with
waiters, lasagna and Salisbury steak in Tennessee, why not
McBurritos in California?
   McDonald's Corp., always looking for a way to spice up its
fast-food menus, is selling egg-filled breakfast burritos for 59
cents at a half-dozen Los Angeles-area outlets, the latest in a
series of experiments.
   ``They're constantly testing new products,'' said Michael
Mueller, an industry analyst with Montgomery Securities in San
Francisco.
   The fast-food company, pressed by competition, has chewed
through a slew of changes recently. It trashed its styrofoam
packaging at the urging of environmentalists. It's testing a
healthier hamburger in which some of the fat is replaced by an
algae derivative.
   Then came word that McDonald's may cut prices permanently on
some menu items to grab a bigger bite of the fast-food pie. Those
rumors propelled its stock onto the New York Stock Exchange's
most-active list Thursday, falling $1.12{ per share to $28.
   Investors apparently want profits as fast as their food - but
analysts say price cuts might help financial results in the long
run.
   The burritos, similar to ones already sold at several smaller
fast-food chains, are a flour tortilla filled with scrambled eggs,
sausage and mild salsa.
   ``It's been selling OK, but there hasn't been a huge demand for
it,'' Edward Wilcox, manager of the McDonald's in the Woodland
Hills area of the San Fernando Valley, said Wednesday.
   Over the years, such fare as salads, McDLTs and Chicken
McNuggets made the transition from test items to McDonald's
staples.
   But not every experiment made the cut. Among the flops was the
Hulaburger: two cheese slices with a slice of grilled pineapple on
a toasted bun.

<TEXT>
   Debt-burdened Western Union Corp. has taken
a new tack to keep afloat by offering 50 cents cash on the dollar
to its bondholders, who rejected the company's first exchange
offer.
   Meanwhile, Western Union confirmed Thursday that its top
officials have been holding job talks with the company's
controlling owner.
   Several major bondholders have threatened to force the
communications company into bankruptcy if they don't get certain
concessions during the company's restructuring effort.
   After scrapping plans to extend its original bond exchange offer
for a 13th time, Western Union offered Thursday to repurchase its
junk bonds for 50 cents on the dollar.
   The cash to fund the offer will come from the proceeds of
Western Union's pending sale of most of its Business Services unit
to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., said spokesman Warren
Bechtel.
   By repurchasing the bonds, Western Union would no longer have to
pay the high rates of interest on them.
   ``Take the money and run,'' was the advice to bondholders from
C. Richard Lehmann of the Bond Investors Association. ``It's a case
of a bird in the hand versus something mysterious in the bush.''
   ``There's very little value in the company, and if it goes into
bankruptcy the lawyers will suck out most of the value left in the
company,'' Lehmann said.
   Several major bondholders have asked that Bennett S. LeBow, the
New York financier whose Brooke Group controls Western Union,
refrain from selling - to himself or to his affiliates - businesses
that will remain after AT&amp;T buys the Business Services unit.
   They also asked for LeBow to be prohibited from selling his
notes and stock.
   If such an agreement is not reached by Dec. 5, the bondholders
said they begin steps to force the company into involuntary
bankruptcy.
   Western Union told the Securities and Exchange Commission in a
filing Tuesday that its three top executives - President Robert
Amman, Chief Financial Officer Stewart J. Paperin and general
counsel John C. Walters - have talked with the the Brooke Group
about other jobs within the parent company.
   Bechtel said that despite the job talks, the three are working
full time to solve Western Union's liquidity crisis.
   When asked why the three were discussing other jobs while the
company teetered on the edge of financial collapse, Bechtel
replied, ``What do you want me to say?''
   The company, based in Upper Saddle River in northern New Jersey,
expects the closing of its transaction with AT&amp;T will occur
simultaneously with the completion of its bond repurchase offer.
   In the previous exchange offer, Western Union offered to buy up
to $530 million of its high-yield junk bonds for a package of new
notes, cash and shares of common stock.
   The company had sought to exchange at least 95 percent of its
19\ percent notes and 80 percent of its 16 percent notes. The
amount tendered was 64 percent of the 19 percent notes and 5
percent of the 16 percent notes.
   The 19\ percent notes were selling at 21\ cents on the dollar,
and the 16 percent notes at 40 cents.
   Western Union's failure to make a profit since 1984 has
apparently not dented the earnings of its top officials.
   Amman, who took charge in 1988, received a 23 percent raise in
1990, to $525,000. Paperin received a 26 percent raise, to
$310,000.
   Year-end bonuses have not been figured, but in 1989 Amman
received a $237,500 bonus and Paperin a $120,000 bonus.
   In addition, Western Union pays LeBow a $200,000 monthly
management fee, or $2.4 million a year.
   Western Union's woes stem from missed opportunity and the march
of technology, Lehmann said.
   When AT&amp;T split up into regional ``Baby Bells,'' Western Union
had a telephone network in place and could have competed with AT&amp;T,
MCI Communications Corp. and U.S. Sprint for long-distance
services.
   ``They were a viable contender, but they continued to plod along
and focused on telex business and electronic mail,'' Lehmann said.
Telex revenues plunged after the fax business exploded.
   Western Union's Bechtel voiced optimism that the company has a
future. But Lehmann said the company has been so busy dismantling
itself to raise cash that the chances are slim that a viable
company will remain.

<HEAD>GM Predicts 4th-Quarter Operating Loss, Plans More Production Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. says it will suffer an
operating loss in the current quarter, its first quarterly red ink
on operations since recession-wracked 1981.
   While the automaker posted a record net loss of $2 billion in
the third quarter, that was due to a $2.1 billion writeoff for
plant closings, which overwhelmed a $109 million profit on
continuing operations.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel told a Fort Wayne, Ind., business
group Thursday night that the world's leading automaker expects its
fourth-quarter operating results ``will decline significantly''
from the third quarter.
   Stempel didn't say whether that would mean an operating loss,
but GM spokesman Terrence Sullivan in Detroit said, ``It certainly
implies a loss in the fourth quarter.''
   Sullivan said GM didn't have a prediction on the size of the
loss. The company also did not comment on whether it would post a
net loss.
   But analyst Ronald Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in San
Francisco predicted GM would post a net loss of $150 million to
$250 million in the quarter.
   Analyst Arvid Jouppi of Detroit-based Arvid Jouppi Associates
Inc. wasn't as pessimistic. ``I think there's still a chance
General Motors will make money in the fourth quarter. They and Ford
(Motor Co.) to some degree will give up the rebate wars. The fact
is, they're not getting enough money for the cars they sell.''
   GM's expected poor showing in the latest quarter comes despite a
new round of production cutbacks, Stempel told the Greater Fort
Wayne Chamber of Commerce.
   The lower production reflects an erosion of consumer confidence
stemming in part from the Persian Gulf crisis, Stempel said.
   GM said earlier this month that it was cutting fourth-quarter
production by 181,000 vehicles. Stempel said Thursday that the
automaker was reducing production by an additional 111,000 cars and
trucks.
   Both reductions will leave GM with plans to build 1.07 million
cars and trucks at its U.S. and Canadian plants during the quarter,
a total below that of the third quarter of 1990 and the fourth
quarter of 1989.
   The cutbacks might extend the Christmas-to-New Year's Day
holiday break for some of GM's 280,000 hourly workers.
   ``What GM is saying is that `We are not going to get caught with
a surplus of cars that we have to sell (with) extreme rebates and
have to shut the plants down in January and February,' as they did
in 1990,'' Jouppi said.
   ``They're making a more realistic schedule for the 1991s than
they did for the 1990s,'' he said.
   ``This is a much larger cut than I anticipated,'' said analyst
Wendy Needham of Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``Basically, they
want to get as much of the pain behind them before 1991 starts.''
   GM last lost money on automotive operations in the second
quarter of 1981 - which, according to Stempel, was roughly the
midpoint of the last severe drop in consumer confidence.
   Other automakers also are affected by crumbling consumer
confidence, Stempel said.
   ``Many people have been taking a `wait and see' attitude toward
major purchase decisions. For the auto industry, this has
translated into weaker automotive demand that has meant temporary
plant shutdowns and layoffs,'' he said.
   ``While GM's overall U.S. market share continues to show gains,
as it has for the entire 1990 calendar year, we are determined to
keep our inventories in line with demand.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is beginning to
prepare for what it used to say was unthinkable - the possibility
that the four-year effort to overhaul the global trading system
could end in failure.
   The talks, which involve 107 nations, are scheduled to wind up
next week with five days of marathon bargaining starting Monday in
Brussels. The United States will be represented by a 280-member
official delegation, including four members of President Bush's
Cabinet.
   The talks, being held under the auspices of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are known as the Uruguay Round, for
the Latin American nation where they were launched in 1986.
   The talks are in danger of failing because of a wide split
between the United States and the 12-nation European Community over
the farm subsidy question. The EC, with its 10 million farmers, has
been unwilling to give up its complex system of subsidies.
   While the president this week said, ``we must not let the
Uruguay Round fail,'' other officials have begun to talk openly of
what the United States will do if that occurs.
   U.S. trade representative Carla Hills and Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter have discussed the possibility that the United
States will more aggressively pursue unilateral measures, using the
threat of retaliation unless other countries open their markets to
American goods.
   ``We simply are not going to be tolerant of continued unfair
trading practices where we believe those are disadvantageous to the
United States,'' Yeutter said, adding that failure of the Uruguay
Round would cause the United States to ``very aggressively'' use
the tools at its disposal to open markets.
   Yeutter said a GATT failure also would intensify the push to
reach bilateral free trade agreements with various countries along
the lines of the U.S.-Canada free trade deal.
   Some believe it was not a coincidence that Bush spent two days
this week visiting Mexico to promote such an arrangement with
America's southern neighbor.
   The danger in these activities, many economists believe, is that
world trade could begin to shrink as trade tensions intensify and
countries split into warring trading blocs.
   The unity achieved by the West in four decades of the Cold War
could disintegrate into a global trade war, according to this
doomsday scenario.
   The GATT negotiating structure was created in 1947 as an effort
to prevent a recurrence of the 1930s trade wars, which played a
part in the Great Depression and the global economic disputes that
boiled over into World War II.
   In this round of talks, the administration had high hopes of
achieving a vastly expanded package to cover more than $1 trillion
of world trade not now under global rules.
   The administration sought to dramatically reduce farm subsidies
that rob U.S. and other farmers of foreign sales, to remove
barriers keeping American service companies such as banks and
insurance firms out of foreign markets and to wipe out copyright
piracy and counterfeiting, which cost U.S. businesses an estimated
$60 billion in lost sales annually.
   The United States has insisted that without sharp reductions in
farm subsidies, farm exporting Third World nations will not go
along with other trade reforms in areas such as services and
copyright protection.
   ``We need fundamental reform in agriculture. A mini-deal will
not achieve either the international support or the U.S. domestic
support we need,'' said an administration official, who briefed
reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Key members of Congress, including Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., have added their backing to the
administration's hard-line negotiating stance.
   ``If the Uruguay Round were to fail, we have many avenues to
pursue in an attempt to open markets,'' Baucus said. ``We should
not be ideologically wedded only to a multilateral approach to
trade issues. We should take a more pragmatic approach and use
whatever works best to open markets.''
   But some observers see danger in the willingness of U.S.
policymakers to walk away from the Uruguay Round, especially with
recessionary storm clouds building around the world.
   ``With the threat of war, uncertain financial markets, the
savings and loan crisis and everything else, this is a lousy time
to have a headline that would read `World Trade Talks Collapse,'''
said William Brock, former trade representative in the Reagan
administration. ``I think we would take a terrible risk in economic
terms.''

   Britain's leading defense contractor, British
Aerospace, is closing two factories and cutting 5,000 jobs because
of a worldwide reduction in orders for military aircraft, the
company said Friday.
   The company's Kingston, south London, factory which makes
fuselages for the Britain's Harrier jet fighters, will be closed by
the end of 1992, with the loss of 2,000 jobs.
   The Preston, northern England, plant which makes the Tornado jet
fighter and the European Fighter Aircraft will close by early 1993,
with the loss of 3,000 jobs.
   The company said the work would be transferred to other British
Aerospace plants. British Aerospace said it hoped to shed 5,000
employees from its workforce of 27,000 by attrition rather than
layoffs.
   A company statement said the plant closures were forced ``both
by advances in technology and by the changing international
market.''

   Listeners tuned in to a radio station today that
broadcasts digital signals to the entire nation from a satellite,
in what its developers say is a first.
   Unlike AM and FM radio broadcasts, which suffer from static,
hiss and limited frequency response, the station beams signals
directly from a satellite to listeners in digital form, similar to
the system used by compact discs.
   ``That results in sound quality that is far better than FM
radio, and equals that on CDs,'' said Tadanobu Kishi, an official
in the Ministry of Posts and Communications.
   Because the broadcasts are digital, listeners with digital audio
tape recorders can make recordings that are virtually perfect
copies of the original master tapes.
   But to receive the new digital station, listeners need a small
satellite dish and a special tuner that can be attached to a
television set to receive TV broadcasts from the same satellite.
   Starting in April, its commercial-free broadcasts will be
scrambled and lengthened from 12 to 24 hours a day, and consumers
will need to buy a $200 decoder and pay a $4.60 monthly fee.
   ``Since we're the first in the world, we want to try to make it
as popular as possible,'' said Yoko Ogame, a Satellite Digital
Audio Broadcasting Co. official.
   Radio GIGA (its frequency is measured in gigahertz) began
broadcasting today with a special ``Earth Symphony'' that featured
the sounds of waves at the Seychelle Islands, whale songs off Maui
Island, a moonlight walk in Tennessee and midnight in a Japanese
forest.
   The Ministry of Posts and Communications hopes the station and
18 other digital satellite stations to follow next year, will offer
a broader range of programming than current commercial broadcasts.
   Most areas in Japan have few radio stations, in part because of
a ministry policy that required equal facilities for all parts of
the archipelago.
   Tokyo's 12 million people have only four FM stations - two
commercial, one public and one that carries school lectures.
   The company hopes to have up to 700,000 paying customers within
two years. Its radio format will consist of ``relaxing'' music from
a variety of styles with a minimum of talk, Ms. Ogame said.
   Owned by a consortium of companies, the station shares a
sttellite channel, or transponder, with Japan Satellite
Broadcasting, a private satellite TV station that also began
broadcasting on Friday and owns 10 percent of Satellite Digital.
   Japan has been a pioneer in direct-broadcast satellites, which
are more powerful than regular communications satellites and beam
signals directly to platter-size antennas at consumers' homes.
   The public Japan Broadcasting Corp., NHK, operates the country's
two other satellite TV channels. More commercial channels are
expected when another satellite becomes operational next year.
   That satellite also will boost the number of digital radio
stations to 19, Kishi said. Stations will be able to broadcast
commercials if they wish, ``but we've asked that they be
commercial-free if they scramble more than half their broadcasts.''
   Some cable TV systems in the United States have offered digital
audio, and a few TV stations have conducted localized test audio
broadcasts on unused UHF channels.
   NHK says about 3.2 million households pay about $7.70 a month to
watch its unscrambled satellite TV broadcasts. Many more have
purchased satellite tuners, industry officials say.
   ``We welcome additional stations as a step toward the coming era
of satellite broadcasting,'' NHK spokesman Takehiko Motohashi said.
``But while satellites are good for unified national broadcasting,
regular land-based broadcasts are best for localized news and
programming.''

<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finland's national airline, Finair,
took ownership of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s first MD-11 jumbo jet.
   The three-engine MD-11 is built by the company's Douglas
Aircraft Co. in Long Beach. McDonnell Douglas has pinned hopes for
a Douglas turnaround on the MD-11, the long-distance,
fuel-efficient successor to its DC-10.
   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas hopes the program will
generate $40 billion in revenues during the next five years. The
aircraft giant has invested more than $700 million to develop the
MD-11 and $2.8 billion in production inventory buildup.
   Speaking to a crowd of more than 1,000 invited guests and
employees at a ceremony Thursday at which the new plane was rolled
out, Douglas President Robert Hood declared the delivery an ``event
of triumph and joy.''
   ``Our choice of the MD-11 was strongly influenced by the
excellent reliability of our DC-10 trijets,'' said Esko Kukkonen,
Finnair's executive vice president for operations.
   Airlines have given McDonnell Douglas 375 commitments to
purchase MD-11s, including 174 firm orders.
   The ceremony was a bright moment for McDonnell Douglas, which
was hit by bad news this week with a report that the Air Force
estimates Douglas will lose $600 million on its C-17 cargo plane
because of cost overruns on fixed price contracts.
   McDonnell Douglas officials disputed that, saying they still
hope the C-17 program can avoid losses. The Air Force plans to buy
120 C-17s for $30 billion.

<TEXT>
   Drivers will pay as much as 5.1 cents a gallon
more for gasoline starting Saturday, and they won't be able to
blame Saddam Hussein.
   A federal tax increase is taking effect, and half of the $25
billion it produces over the next five years will go for deficit
reduction. Most of the rest will pay for highway and mass transit
improvements.
   A family that drives 12,000 miles in a car that averages 22
miles per gallon will pay about $28 more a year.
   Flying and shipping by air also will cost more beginning
Saturday. The 8 percent federal tax on airline tickets will rise to
10 percent and the 5 percent levy on air freight will go up to 6.25
percent. Those increases, when combined with higher taxes on
non-commercial aviation fuel used by private planes, will bring in
almost $12 billion over five years.
   Nothing in the law says service station owners must pass along
the higher gasoline and diesel tax to consumers - but economics
indicates they will.
   ``Prices will go up at 12:01 a.m.,'' predicted Dave Haddad Sr.
of Pittsburgh, president of the Service Station Dealers of America.
   ``Half the retailers are making one, two or three cents profit
on a gallon,'' he said. ``How can they eat a nickel a gallon?
Retailers have no alternative but to increase the price by five
cents a gallon.''
   The new federal tax on gasoline used on highways or in
motorboats will be 14.1 cents a gallon; the tax on diesel for
highway use, 20.1 cents. Diesel used by trains will face a new 2.5
cent tax. The tax on non-commercial aviation gasoline will rise to
15.1 cents and the levy on non-commercial jet fuel goes to 17.6
cents a gallon.
   The nickel-a-gallon boost for gasoline follows the price runup
that hit after Aug. 2, when Iraqi President Saddam invaded Kuwait,
shutting off most of the oil from both those Persian Gulf nations.
   Jerry Cheske of American Automobile Association headquarters in
Orlando, Fla., said that as of Tuesday, the national average price
of a gallon of customer-pumped regular unleaded gasoline was
$1.366. That was up 0.7 cents from a week earlier and 29.1 cents
above the Aug. 1 average.
   If most retailers boost their prices by the full 5 or 5.1 cents
a gallon, the nationwide average price would rise to about $1.41 a
gallon.
   Before the tax was raised, the Congressional Budget Office
estimated that almost 94 percent of households buy motor fuel and
will pay an average of $990 for it this year.
   With state taxes included, the average tax on gasoline in the
United States last year was 30 cents a gallon. That compares with
$3.05 in Italy, $2.76 in Denmark and $2.34 in France and Ireland.
   The last federal tax increase was 5 cents a gallon in 1983.
   The latest increase was passed by Congress in October as part of
a plan to reduce the federal deficit by nearly $500 billion over
the next five years. The increase includes 5 cents that will be
divided between highway improvements and deficit reduction, and 0.1
cent per gallon to clean up leaking underground storage tanks.
   The Highway Trust Fund, which finances most federal highway and
bridge construction, will get 2.5 cents of the increase. The mass
transit side of the highway fund, which has been getting 1 cent of
the 9-cent gas and diesel tax, will get 1{ cents of the 14.1-cent
levy.
   The increased taxes on airline tickets and cargo, expected to
bring in about $4 billion over five years, will go for deficit
reduction for the next two years, then into the trust fund that
finances airport and airway improvements.
   An estimated $50 million a year of taxes that otherwise would go
to the highway fund will be drained off to finance restoration of
wetlands. That is the tax likely to be collected from the sale of
gasoline used for such non-highway machinery as lawn mowers, snow
blowers, chain saws and leaf mulchers.

<HEAD>FDIC To Give Freedom National Bank Depositors 50 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York congressman says the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. did only ``half the right thing'' by deciding to
pay depositors of the defunct Freedom National Bank 50 percent of
their uninsured balances.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., announced on Thursday night that
the FDIC had authorized payment to uninsured clients of the
Harlem-based bank such as churches and charitable organizations.
   Freedom National, the nation's fourth-largest black-owned bank,
closed its doors earlier this month.
   Alan Witney, an FDIC spokesman in Washington, confirmed
Rangel's announcement.
   ``That's a good first step, but I still insist that when the
government tells people their money is insured and that it is safe,
they really mean that,'' Rangel said. ``The FDIC has done half the
right thing.''
   The FDIC only insures deposits of up to $100,000. Many local
charities - including Harlem- and Brooklyn-based organizations
providing day care, foster care, housing and victims assistance -
had multiple accounts in the bank with totals that exceeded that
amount.
   The FDIC said checks would go out ``in a couple of days'' to
depositors who had filed claims, Rangel said.
   But the congressman whose district includes parts of Harlem said
``the FDIC has a long way to go to make things up to the depositors
at Freedom National and to the community, whom they failed to give
any time to either withdraw their money or to make other
arrangements.''
   Rangel said he would continue his efforts for full compensation
to the depositors.
   ``There is still a double standard between the treatment
accorded the depositors at Freedom and those at a number of larger
banks,'' said Rangel. ``In the cases of several large failing banks
... the FDIC prevented any losses at all to the depositors.''
   Freedom National was founded in 1964 as a financial resource for
Harlem. It lost $4 million over the past two years before being
closed down by federal regulators.

   Trading on the Brussels stock exchange

   The exchange is expected to reopen Monday.
   No one was hurt in the early morning fire which broke out in a
second floor high power room and reached the roof.
   Firemen quickly controlled it and the exchange's main trading
computer did not seem damaged but smoke left a layer of soot on
most of the building's interior, including brokers' desks, screens

   Stock Exchange Prsident Jean Peterbroeck said repair and

resume Monday.
   It was the second time this year that a fire closed the bourse.

   The stock market posted modest losses this

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators approved the sale of Great
American Bank's California operations to Wells Fargo &amp; Co., but
also issued a case-and-desist order to the thrift in approving its
revised capital plan.
   The approval of the sale calls for Great American to hand over
130 retail branches in the state with $6.4 billion in deposits to
Wells Fargo for approximately $491 million.
   But the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) warned in the order
issued Thursday that a violation of the revised capital plan would
result in possible seizure of what remains of Great American or its
submission to a merger or acquisition negotiated on behalf of the
OTS.
   Great American's capital plan reflects the anticipated effect of
the transaction with Wells Fargo and details Great American's plans
for achieving compliance with new capital requirements by the end
of 1994.
   Great American chief executive Robert Kemper said approval of
the revised capital plan ``was a major step forward for this
institution,'' and was confident it could meet the stringent
provisions outlined under the plan.
   ``We wouldn't have put together a capital plan if we felt we
couldn't accomplish it,'' Kemper said.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Wells Fargo's
primary regulator, approved the Great American sale in late
October. The OTS and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. did not
announce their approval until Thursday.
   Great American will be left with roughly $9 billion in assets
and 81 retail branches in Arizona, Washington and Colorado and a
huge problem loan portfolio.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices turned mixed
after a strong opening this morning on the CHicago Board of Trade,
where the action again was dominated by speculation about Soviet
purchases of U.S. grain.
   The markets opened higher amid unconfirmed rumors that President
Bush was prepared to waive a trade law that requires the Soviets to
Liberalize their emigration policies before becoming eligible for
U.S. food export credit guarantees, analysts said.
   Profit-taking quickly eroded gains in the soybean market but
corn remained mostly stronger in reaction to lighter-than-expected
delivery notices posted today against the December contract.
   Corn also was supported by unconfirmed talk the Soviet UNion or
Eastern European countries may have bought at least 600,000 metric
tons of U.S. corn overnight. Wheat drew strength from the
Agriculture Department's confirmation that the Soviets bought
16,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat flour at subsidized prices.
   DOn Roose, grain analyst with U.S. Commodities Inc., said time
is running out for the United States to offer export credits to the
Soviets for large food purchases.
   ``They're picking the stuff up around the world. If we don't do
it in the next week or two, it's just going to be too late,'' he
said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to 3} cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $2.42} a
bushel; corn was 1{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at
$2.26 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1} cents higher with
December at $1.09 a bushel; and soybeans were 2\ cents lower to 1{
cents higher with January at $5.92} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .58 cent lower with December at
78.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with January at 87.45 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
to .30 cent lower with December at 50.35 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .65 cent lower to 1.15 cents higher with February at

<DATELINE>FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokheim Corp., a major manufacturer
of service station gasoline pumps, said Friday it will close its
Newbern, Tenn., assembly plant to reduce manufacturing costs and
become more competitive.
   Operations at the Tennessee plant, which currently employs 308
people, will be consolidated into the Fort Wayne fabrication and
machining plant by the late summer of 1991, the company said.
   Tokheim officials said a new contract with members of the United
Auto Workers union at the Fort Wayne factory was a main factor in
their decision to relocate the Newbern operations to northeastern
Indiana. The agreement extends to April 1997 and contains a
no-strike provision until April 2000.
   ``The new contract allows for much greater flexibility within
our manufacturing group at a competitive labor cost,'' said DOnald
E. Rhodes, senior vice president of manufacturing.
   Rhodes added that the plant consolidation will allow the company
to increase productivity and improve quality while reducing
response time to customer orders.
   The Newbern plant will be sold. Workers who do not relocate to
Fort Wayne or receive another position with the company will be
provided with severance and placement programs.
   Fourth-quarter net earnings will reflect a one-time, after tax
charge of about $1.1 million to $1.4 million, or 17 to 22 cents per
Share, representing the estimated net costs and expenses directly
associated with the plant closing, the company said.
   Because of the consolidation, net earnings are expected to
improve by up to 40 cents per share beginning in 1992.
   Tokheim designs and manufactures electronic petroleum marketing
and monitoring systems, including service station equipment and
card-activated transaction systems. The company also designs and
produces process control automation systems for the natural gas,
oil, petrochemical, process water and agriculture markets.

   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond gained &rsqb; point, or $3.75
per $1,000 in face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves in an
opposite direction from the bond's price, fell to 8.45 percent from
8.49 percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said the bond market was heartened by the prospect that
war in the Middle East might be averted through diplomatic
Channels. On Thursday, bond prices slumped after the U.N. Security
Council approved a resolution allowing the use of military force to
remove Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   But there was still some caution in the market. Immediately
after Bush's announcement, bond prices surged | point higher but
they gave up some ground as some traders decided to take some quick
profits.
   The market was focused on the Persian Gulf, and had little
reaction to the news that the government's chief economic
forecasting gauge, the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, fell
1.2 percent in October, its fourth straight monthly decline.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities rose 3-32 point to &lsqb; point, intermediate maturities
gained 3-16 point to \ point, and long-term issues rose between \
point and 5-16 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information
service reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.25 to 1,172.07.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.22 percent as the
discount fell 2 basis points to 7.01 percent. Yields on six-month
bills slipped to 7.33 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points
to 6.99 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 7.29 percent
as the discount fell 3 basis points to 6.83 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was quoted at 7{ percent, down from 7 9-16 point late
Thursday.

Approved</HEAD>

   The Gillette Co. is threatening to close the
world's largest razor blade plant in Boston if the city bans
ozone-depleting chemicals.
   The City Council is considering outlawing chemicals that, when
released into the atmosphere, deplete the ozone layer protecting
the Earth from damaging rays from the sun.
   At a hearing Thursday, Gillette Vice Chairman Joseph E. Mullaney
said the ban would put the company at a significant competitive
disadvantage, and if the bill is adopted, Gillette will close its
plant in the South Boston section by January 1992.
   A statement from the company this morning soft-pedaled the
threat somewhat, saying if the proposed ordinance is approved,
Gillette ``will make any necessary decisions at that time.'' Joan
Fitzgerald, a Gillette spokeswoman, said the company hoped a
compromise wording for the ordinance could be worked out.
   The Gillette plant employs 3,100 people.
   Mullaney said Gillette uses the chemicals to coat the edges of
razor blades and to clean equipment.
   The Du Pont Co., which provides the blade-coating chemicals,
says it is searching for substitutes, and Gillette already has
found some for the cleaning chemicals, Mullaney said.
   The proposed law would cost the company money by requiring
labels starting Jan. 1 on all razors and packages of blades made at
the plant, saying they were made with chemicals harmful to ozone. A
year later, the substances would be banned.
   Mullaney said the company supports efforts to save the ozone but
the Boston ban, coming on top of national and international
efforts, would create varying standards and confusion.
   Gillette reformulated all of its domestic aerosol products in
1977 to replace chlorofluorocarbon propellants with propellants
that do not affect the upper atmosphere, Mullaney said.
   Mark Sommer, an activist with the Greenpeace environmental
organization, said similar bans in Newark, N.J., and Irvine,
Calif., ``haven't resulted in one job loss or company relocation.''
   Secretary of State Michael J. Connolly submitted testimony
through an aide saying he supported the ban if it allows companies
to seek exemptions on a hardship basis.
   Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce President James L. Sullivan
said the ban would have a catastrophic effect on businesses and a
negligible impact on saving the ozone layer.

<HEAD>Restructuring to Result in $52 Million Annual Loss, Elimination of
140 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Society for Savings said today it will
sell about $1.6 billion worth of assets in a restructuring that
will result in a $52 million loss for the year and the elimination
of 140 jobs.
   Society for Savings Bancorp Inc., the bank's parent company,
said the bank needs to jettison about $130 million in
non-performing commercial real estate loans and other assets to
reduce expenses and remain competitive as New England's economy
deteriorates.
   The bank will also increase its reserve fund to $103.5 million,
up from the $49.5 million as of Sept. 30.
   ``The steps ... reflect a careful assessment of the prevailing
industry conditions and the New England regional environment
affecting the bank,'' the bank company said in its announcement.
   Meanwhile, the parent company announced that Elliott Miller will
retire as president and chief executive officer as of Jan. 1 after
12 years as president.
   The projected 1990 loss includes a $58.6 million charge for
severance payments and other restructuring expenses. The bank
expects a fourth-quarter loss of $54.4 million, or $4.57 a share.
The loss for the year amounts to $4.37 a share.
   The restructuring will take place in three stages over the next
13 months under a plan approved by the parent company's board of
directors.
   First, the bank will sell a ``significant portion'' of its
securities portfolio and selected loans portfolios of performing
assets. Then it will sell about $130 million worth of
non-performing commercial real estate loans and real estate the
bank itself owns.
   Finally, the bank will try to sell certain other assets and
lines of business. Gains from such sales will not be recorded until
realized.
   The 140 jobs being eliminated represent about 15 percent of the
bank's work force. That doesn't include those personnel who may
work for business lines being sold off.

   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge fell in October for the fourth straight month, signaling a
recession that many economists say already has arrived. President
Bush said today the economy is ``at best in a serious slowdown''
that could worsen.
Leading Economic Indicators was the latest in a string of gloomy
reports on the economy.
   Eight of the 11 forward-looking components in the index fell. In
addition, the department said, the index actually dropped 0.1
percent in July rather than remaining unchanged as first reported.
   Three consecutive declines in the index have been viewed as a
fairly reliable - although not infallible - sign that a recession
is approaching. The gauge is designed to forecast economic
conditions six to nine months in advance.
   Bush linked the economic downturn to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and said the new democracies in Eastern Europe also have been hurt
by Saddam Hussein's actions.
   ``The increase in oil prices resulting directly from Saddam is
hurting our country, too,'' Bush said at a nationally televised
news conference. ``OUr economy, as I said the other day, is at best
in a serious slowdown. And if uncertainty remains in the energy
markets, the slowdown will get worse.''
they believe a recession already has started. Even Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, usually cautious about characterizing the
economy, said this week it now is in a ``meaningful downturn.''
   ``The October leading indicators contained clear, classical
signs that we are in a recession,'' said William K. MacReynolds,
forecasting director for the U.S. Chamber of COmmerce. ``Instead of
foretelling a recession that is a few months away, those indicators
show that it already has started.''
   Bush told a group of bankers Thursday that ``the slowdown or the
recession or whatever one would call exactly what we're in now''
will be a short one.
   The index also sank 1.2 percent in August, the steepest decline
since a 1.4 percent drop a month after the October 1987 stock
market crash. It slid an additional 0.8 percent in September.
   There has not been a recession since World War II without the
index turning down for at least three consecutive months.
   ON the other hand, the gauge was negative for six months in 1984
and again for four months following the 1987 crash. Both times, the
economy escaped a recession.
   PUlling the index down were a dropin a figure measuring
consumer confidence, an increase in weekly unemployment claims, a
Decline in the average workweek, a drop in building permits, a
decline in the money supply, falling stock prices, a decrease in
the price of raw materials, and faster business delivery times.
   The only positive contributors were increases in orders for
Consumer goods, orders for new plants and equipment and in unfilled
Orders.
   The various changes left the index at 141.6 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and down 1.9 percent from its level a year ago.
   The index has fallen during six of the 10 months so far this
year.
   Since most of the components are announced earlier, many
economists view the index more as a useful statistic in summarizing
economic events than a genuine ``leading indicator.''
   ``I would not say it's gospel'' in forecasting recessions, said
economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International. ``We
should never think there is one single measure that can capture all
of the flavor of the modern, sophisticated economy.''
   ``It's like asking a painter to paint the most beautiful picture
in the world using only one color,'' Brusca added. ``The painter
might find it to be a very interesting challenge, but I doubt the
work would be without serious shortfalls.''
   Laurence H Meyer, economist for a St. Louis economic
forecasting firm, maintains the Persian Gulf crisis pre-empted the
advance warning this time.
   ``What we had was an economy thatsliding toward a recession ... then
got hit with a series of
adverse shocks which pushed it over the edge very abruptly,'' he
said.
   Meyer and other economists also note that better inventory
management has cut into the index's lead-time in recent years.
   ``Production cutbacks are following demand much more closely so
we're not seeing inventory pile up as demand softens,'' he said.
``We're not getting the normal lead time.''
   IN past recessions, there were major inventory accumulations
which caused severe production cutbacks as businesses attempted to
sell their backlogs. That in turn caused the loss of jobs and
worsened the downturn.

   President Bush's offer of negotiations with Iraq.
   Bush, at a Washington press conference, invited Iraq's foreign
minister to come to Washington and offered to send Secretary of
State James Baker to Baghdad.
   The dollar, traditionally a safe haven in times of turmoil, had
gained following the U.N. Security Council's decision late Thursday
to set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait. Bush's comments
on Friday eased fears of conflict and the dollar sank accordingly,
dealers said.

late Thursday. In New York, one pound fetched $1.9420.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 132.75 Japanese yen from
130.15 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 133.05
yen, and in New York, a dollar cost 132.80 yen.

   Orin E. Atkins, the former chairman of Ashland
Oil Inc., was sentenced Friday to probation and community service
for trying to sell confidential company documents to Iran.
   U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight of Manhattan said that
although he felt Atkins had committed a serious crime, he decided
prison time was not warranted because Atkins cooperated with
prosecutors and agreed to pay restitution to Ashland.
   The restitution settlement, announced in court by Ashland
attorney John C. Elam, calls for Atkins to forgo more than $2
million in consulting fees and pension benefits and repay $250,000.
   Haight sentenced Atkins to two years' probation and 600 hours of
community service. The judge imposed no additional fine, citing
Atkins' diminished finances.
   Atkins, 66, of North Palm Beach, Fla., pleaded guilty in
September 1989 to conspiracy and wire fraud and agreed to cooperate
with the government.
   He had faced a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.
   Atkins admitted that after he resigned as chairman in 1981 but
remained as a paid Ashland consultant, he obtained confidential
documents involving the company's decision not to pay the National
Iranian Oil Co. for $283 million in crude oil purchased in 1979.
   The company said it withheld payment because of a trade ban on
Iran that the United States imposed following the taking of
American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979.
   Atkins and others involved in the scheme offered to sell the
documents to the Iranian company for use in a possible lawsuit
against Ashland over its non-payment.
   The documents were offered at various times for $20 million or a
25 percent contingency fee.
   While the Iranians never bought the documents, they later sued
Ashland and last year obtained a $325 million settlement, which
with interest was worth more than $500 million.
   In a statement to the court before sentencing, Atkins described
the embarrassment and anguish his acts caused his family and
friends.
   ``I have no excuses for my actions other than I think anger or
some resentment obviously short-circuited my brain,'' Atkins said.
   His attorney, James Moss, asked Haight to impose only probation,
saying Atkins had been punished enough. Moss said the restitution
agreement with Ashland had left his client in ``almost financial
destitution.''
   The judge said he believed Atkins' role in the scheme was an
isolated occurrence.
   ``This act of venal criminality was aberrational,'' Haight said.
``It stands in stark contrast to everything else he had done, said
or attempted to do.''
   As part of his cooperation with prosecutors, Atkins testified
earlier this year at the trial of an attorney, Charles Barnett, who
was accused of participating in the scheme to sell the Ashland
documents to the Iranian company.
   Barnett, of Palm Beach, Fla., was acquitted.
   A third defendant, oil broker Roy Furmark, pleaded guilty to a
role in the conspiracy and is scheduled to be sentenced in federal
court on Monday.

   Mazda Motor Corp., one of Japan's major automakers,
said Friday it has purchased a high-performance supercomputer from
U.S.-based Cray Research Inc. in an effort to improve its
automotive research and development ability.
   It said the new computer, the Y-MP2E-216, offers about three
times higher performance than the Cray X-MP-216 model that Mazda
bought from the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based manufacturer in April
1989.
   Mazda officials said they expect the new model will increase the
company's computer simulation capacity in such areas as crash
analysis for improving vehicle safety and vehicle structural
analysis for weight reduction.
   Business sources said the new supercomputer would cost about $10
million.
   Supercomputers are high-capacity machines that can quickly
perform calculations on vast amounts of figures.

<HEAD>Bond Investors Group Says Get Out of Junk Funds Before It's Too
Late</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond Investors Association Inc. is offering some
advice to junk bond mutual fund investors: Get out before it's too
late.
   The non-profit organization tracks bond defaults and predicts
$50 billion in junk bonds will go bad in 1991 and 1992. Mutual
funds that invested in the dismal junk bond market are holding many
bonds they would happily sell if they could find buyers, the Miami
Lakes, Fla.-based association said.
   Because the funds have been forced to sell their liquid holdings
as investors cash in shares, the funds are left with
default-vulnerable and hard-to-sell issues, said C. Richard Lehman,
BIA president.
   That leads to a number of problems, according to Lehman,
including the possibility that the bond funds will default at a
rate higher than the market as a whole.
   On top of that, the group says, the bond funds' daily net asset
values, or their net worth, are routinely overstated. If the bond
funds could actually sell their unwanted securities, the bonds'
market prices would likely plummet, bringing down the net asset
value, BIA said.
   ``A fund holder who is selling his shares is being overpaid
relative to the realizable value of the portfolio,'' BIA said in
the December edition of the Defaulted Bonds Newsletter.
   ``The only benefit fund holders still have is the ability to
liquidate their holdings even while their fund cannot,'' the
association said.
   BIA did not mention particular mutual funds.
   ``We decided not to try to finger the specific candidates,
although we could,'' Lehman said.
   Junk bond fund managers were not willing to talk about the
report.
   A spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, Betty Hart,
said investors frequently hedge their risk by diversifying
investments.
   ``There are a number of different types of mutual funds with
varying objectives and, generally speaking, for any fund that is
highly aggressive, whether it be equities or bonds, good financial
planning principles suggest people have more than one investment,''
Ms. Hart said.
   BIA also takes the bond funds to task for their accounting
methods. The group wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to
force the funds to set aside some of the interest income to cover
losses expect from defaults.
   ``This is not unlike a business concern that sells its products
on credit to high risk customers without booking a provision for
uncollectible accounts receivable,'' the newsletter said.
   There is good news, though.
   If the junk bond market is going to recover, the gains could be
huge.
   BIA suggests investors who want to stay in junk bonds should
sell their current fund holding and buy into a newly established
fund or one with assets of less than $100 million.
   BIA says go ahead and pay the typical 5 percent front-end load.
   ``A new fund should outperform an existing fund by many times
this cost,'' the newsletter said.
   The junk funds have been feeling heat lately.
   The collapse of the market has sent prices reeling and their
corresponding yields soaring.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission in October asked the
funds to make it clear to potential investors that high yield means
high risk.
   The bonds' prices have been beaten down as the market has become
more worrisome that a recession will make it hard, if not
impossible, for some issuers to make interest and principal
payments.

   The stock market leaped ito positive territory
today, buoyed by President Bush's promise that he will try to try
to avoid a war and offer to open diplomatic channels with Iraq.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was off from the
opening bell, was up 37.13 points at 2,555.94 at midday.
   Gaining issues were outpacing decliners by about 11 to 5 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 982 up, 442 down and 509 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 124.17 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Bush said at a late morning news conference that he remains
``hopeful we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis.'' His
comments come a day after United Nations authorized the use of
force against Iraq if it doe not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   Bush's remarks sent the price of oil tumbling $3 a barrel, bond
prices higher and prompted the stock market to reverse a downward
trend that took hold earlier in the week.
   The market ``gradually started to pick up steam,'' said Gene Jay
Seagle, a vice president at Gruntal Financial Inc., adding that
computer-driven buy programs accelerated the move.
   Separately, Bush conceded that the economy is headed for
recession. Those comments also helped support equities, since the
Federal Reserve is more likely to lower interest rates to stimulate
the economy.
   On the fundamental front, the Commerce Department reported the
index of leading indicators fell 1.2 percent in October, its fourth
consecutive monthly decline. A three-month drop generally, but not
always, indicates the economy is on the cusp of a recession.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, GM, which announced
production cutbacks and said its operating profits would fall in
the fourth quarter, fell | to 36&rsqb;. Motorola plunged 3| to 50\;
analysts had lowered their earnings estimates for the company.
   Elsewhere, US Shoe was off 1} at 7}; Nike was off 2\ at 33};
General Electric advanced 1&rsqb; to 54{, and Philip Morris was up &rsqb; at
48&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index jumped 2.32 to 175.46. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained 0.20 to

<HEAD>First Shares Offered In State-Run Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poles lined up at banks Friday to buy
shares in the first five state-run companies to be privatized under
the country's post-Communist economic reforms.
   A Western-style advertising campaign with sophisticated graphics
tried to educate potential buyers on how the investments work,
where to purchase shares and what risks to consider.
   ``Learn the power of your money,'' the advertisements say.
   Five companies, considered to be the better run and more
efficient from the beleaguered socialized economy, are being
privatized in the first round of economic reforms. They are the
Krosno glass works, the Kielce construction company Exbud, the Lodz
textile company Prochnik, a Silesian cable factory and Tonsil, an
audio equipment company.
   Share prices ranged from 50,000 zlotys, about $5, to 112,000
zlotys, or $12. The minimum purchase was five shares.
   Ultimately, some 7,000 companies, accounting for more than 80
percent of the Polish economy, are to be transferred from state to
private ownership or otherwise liquidated in the drive to create a
capitalist economy and an investment market.
   Government economists devised complex systems for selling off
the companies, reserving up to 20 percent of shares for workers at
lower prices, retaining some for the state treasury and limiting
the portion that can be purchased by foreigners.
   By late January, the shares will be allocated to buyers,
although the shares will be held by the national banks until a
stock market is created.
   At two Warsaw banks, 1,500 applications for the first offring
were received by 3 p.m., with the average purchase put at 10
million zlotys, or about $1,050, state television reported.
   Oversubscription was expected for most of the companies,
although uncertainty caused by the presidential campaign now under
way and the financial pressure of the holiday season might limit
sales, said Grzegorz Meza, an economist in the privatization
ministry.
   ``This is the worst possible time,'' he said. ``But even if
people are not experienced in investment, we think Poles will think
this is going to be good business.''

<TEXT>
   About 360 workers at General Motors
Corp.'s Fort Wayne Assembly Plant will be laid off indefinitely
Jan. 14.
   Keri Hulsey, assistant public affairs director for the company's
truck and bus division, said the plant is cutting production to
reduce a growing surplus of CK trucks.
   ``We are bringing our production in line with the sales of the
vehicles,'' she said. ``Many of our plants are facing the same type
of situation.''
   The announcement came a day after Robert C. Stempel, GM
chairman, delivered a speech in Fort Wayne announcing the nation's
biggest automaker will cut fourth-quarter North American production
by 110,000 units beyond an earlier 181,000 cut.
   Stempel said the 3,000 workers at the Fort Wayne Assembly Plant
have continued to make productivity gains. Continuing progress in
quality and competitiveness is ``the only real guarantee of job
security for the long-term,'' he said, after touring the plant
Thursday.
   A CK plant in Pontiac, Mich., will also lay off 350 employees
the same day Fort Wayne production is curtailed. But a CK plant in
Oshua, Ontario, will escape layoffs because it produces a more
popular version of the truck, with an extended cab.
   She would not predict when sales may strengthen enough to call
back workers.

   The stock market soared higher today following
President Bush's pledge to seek a diplomatic solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which was drifting
lower until midday, had jumped 43.32 points to 2,562.13 an hour
before the closing bell.
   Gaining issues were overwhelming decliners by about 5 to 2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,060 up, 406 down and 489
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 155.89 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street.
   Bush said at a late morning news conference that he remains
``hopeful we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis.'' His
comments come a day after United Nations authorized the use of
force against Iraq if it does not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   Bush's remarks sent the price of oil tumbling nearly $4 a
barrel, bond prices higher and prompted the stock market to reverse
a downward trend that took hold earlier in the week.
   The market ``started to pick up steam,'' said Gene Jay Seagle, a
vice president at Gruntal Financial Inc. The Dow cracked the
technically important 2,550 level as computer-driven buy programs
added a jolt of momentum. The advance was so steep that it
triggered an automatic restraint on computerized trading, which
goes into effect when the Dow falls or rises by 50 points.
   Separately, Bush conceded that the economy is headed for
recession. Those comments also helped support equities, since the
Federal Reserve is more likely to lower interest rates to stimulate
the economy.
   On the fundamental front, the Commerce Department reported the
index of leading indicators fell 1.2 percent in October, its fourth
consecutive monthly decline. A three-month drop generally, but not
always, indicates the economy is on the cusp of a recession.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, General Electric was up
1&rsqb; at 54{; Nike was off 2 at 34, and Philip Morris was up ~ at 48~.
   Motorola plunged 3| to 50\; analysts lowered their earnings
estimates for the company. GM, which announced production cutbacks
and said its operating profits would fall in the fourth quarter,
fell { to 36{.
   The NYSE's composite index jumped 2.63 to 175.77. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained 0.74 to
300.61.

   Wheat and corn futures prices closed higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after President Bush said he
would consider waiving U.S. export restrictions and grant food
export credits to the Soviet Union.
   Soybean futures ended mixed as profit-taking erased gains that
were posted immediately after Bush's remarks.
   The Soviets have been seeking export credits to enable them to
buy U.S. grain, including about 1.2 million metric tons of wheat
and 600,000 metric tons of corn they are obligated to purchase by
year's end under a long-term grain agreement.
   The Bush administration has maintained it cannot grant export
credits without violating a 1974 law that denies the Soviets
coveted most-favored-nation trade status because of their
restrictions on emigration.
   But Bush told a news conference Friday that he may have clearer
authority to waive the trade restrictions than he had thought, and
that he would consider doing so.
   ``A lot of the trade now is assuming it's a done deal,'' said
Dan Cekander, a grain analyst with the Chicago trading company
Rodman &amp; Renshaw Inc.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 6{ cents higher

   Oil prices tumbled more than $4 per barrel today
as President Bush held out the possibility of a diplomatic solution
to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Contracts for light sweet crude fell more than $1 per barrel in
a span of several minutes while Bush was on television giving his
assessment of the crisis. His remarks followed a vote late Thursday
in which the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of force to
push Iraqi troops out of oil-rich Kuwait if Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein does not withdraw them by Jan. 15.
   Crude then kept falling sharply, sinking below the $30 per
barrel threshold, after Bush's news conference had ended.
   By late afternoon, contracts for crude delivery in January were
down $4.21 per barrel, at $28.70, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Oil's biggest move during the crisis was a fall of $5.41
per barrel on Oct. 22.
   Contracts for crude delivery in several later months were down
by their daily limit of $1.50 per barrel.
   Bush said he would invite Iraqi's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
to come to Washington in December to discuss the situation. Bush
also mentioned the possibility that he would send Secretary of
State James A. Baker III to Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
   ``The reaction is very much to his inviting Tariq Aziz to
Washington and Baker to Baghdad,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior
oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   The market had moved up earlier in the week in anticipation of
the U.N. resolution, so Bush's comments indicating that he would
send troops into combat if necessary did not move the market. The
president said he would accept nothing less than a complete
withdrawal of Iraqi troops and freedom for hostages held by Saddam.
   ``This has been a war premium market,'' Hittle said. ``We rose
on expectation of the U.N. resolution being passed. With his
comment today, we're losing that war premium and backing off.''
   As oil plummeted, prices for refined petroleum products also
fell.
   By early afternoon, home heating oil was down 6.42 cents at
87.10 cents a gallon on December delivery contracts. Unleaded
gasoline fell 5.12 cents a gallon to 78.25 cents on December
delivery contracts.
   Some of the contracts for product delivery in later months were
down by their daily limit of 4 cents a gallon.
   Natural gas was off 7.5 cents at $2.415 per 1,000 cubic feet on
contracts for delivery in January.

   Stock and bond prices climbed sharply Friday and
oil prices fell after comments by President Bush led to renewed
hope that the Iraqi stalemate could be resolved peacefully and that
interest rates could fall.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
was up 43.32 points to 2,562.13 an hour before the 4 p.m. EST
closing bell.
   The price of oil tumbled more than $4 a barrel as fear of war in
the Mideast oil fields eased. Government bond prices also rallied.
   At a midmornig news conference, Bush said he said remains
``hopeful we can achieve a peaceful solution to this crisis.''
   Bush said he would send Secretary of State James Baker to
Baghdad to meet with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and suggested
that Iraq's foreign mininster visit Washington for discussions.
   The president also added his voice to the growing belief that
the nation's economy has entered an major slump.
   ``Our economy, as I said the other day, is at best in a serious
slowdown. And if uncertainty remains in the energy markets, the
slowdown will get worse,'' he said.
   Those comments compounded government figures released Friday
morning that also indicated a looming recession. The Commerce
Department said its Index of Leading Economic Indicators fell 1.2
percent in October on top of three previous monthly declines
including July, when the index was first reported to have been
flat.
   Three consecutive declines in the forward-looking index are
considered a fairly reliable sign that a recession is near.
   News of an economic downturn makes it more likely the Federal
Reserve will ease interest rates, which is good for both the stock
and bond markets.
   The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was up a full
point by midafternoon. A point equals a $10 change in the price of
a bond with a $1,000 face value.

<HEAD>Judge to Approve Liquidation for American Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Friday he will approve a
plan to liquidate the assets of Charles Keating Jr.'s American
Continental Corp., the former parent company of Lincoln Savings and
Loan.
   Under the plan, American Continental's assets would be
liquidated over three years to provide partial payment to the
company's 25,000 creditors, who are owed $365 million.
   More than 9,200 creditors participated in a recent vote on the
proposal, and 95 percent approved it, said Donald Gaffney, an
attorney for unsecured creditors. He said the plan also was
accepted by all classes of creditors.
   The plan was opposed by Keating and some of his former top
executives, who invested in the company's securities. They said it
would push them to the end of the creditors' line and make it
unlikely they would receive any money.
   But no one spoke against the plan when Gaffney outlined it to
District Judge Richard Bilby. The judge said he would approve the
plan but didn't specify when.
   ``You've accomplished the impossible,'' Bilby told lawyers in
the case. ``It's like almost any settlement I've known. There ain't
much in it for anybody.''
   Lincoln Savings, based in Irvine, Calif., was seized by federal
regulators in April 1989, just one day after American Continental
and 11 Lincoln Savings subsidiaries filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Federal officials have said Lincoln's failure could cost
taxpayers $2 billion.
   The case has become symbolic of the national S&amp;L debacle.
Keating and other Lincoln executives are the subject of a
class-action lawsuit alleging they misled investors about the
safety of junk bonds issued by American Continental. Nearly 18,000
investors lost $250 million, authorities allege.
   In addition, the Senate Ethics Committee is holding hearings on
whether five senators - Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and Donald W.
Riegle Jr., D-Mich. - improperly intervened with federal regulators
on Keating's behalf because of the $1.3 million he and associates
contributed to their campaigns and favorite causes.
   Unsecured creditors of American Continental can expect to
receive their first payments by the end of January, said Gaffney,
who represents the Unsecured Creditors Committee.
   Some 22,000 unsecured creditors hold American Continental bonds.
   Gaffney said the bondholders' first checks probably will amount
to ``pennies on the dollar'' on their investment.
   The timing and amount of later checks would depend on
liquidation of American Continental assets, now valued at $9
million, and outcome of suits filed by creditors against Keating,
Keating associates and legal and accounting firms which advised
American Continental.
   A proposal approved by Bilby Nov. 16 to allow the Lincoln
Savings subsidiaries to pay their creditors would go into effect
with the liquidation plan. The subsidiaries' creditors will receive
virtually all the $120 million they are owed.
   Under the liquidation proposal, Thomas Arnold Jr., a Phoenix
consultant who was appointed by Bilby to head American Continental,
and three other members of a steering committee would wind down the
company's operations over a three-year period.
   The plan is a compromise between the creditors and the federal
Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set up to handle the nation's
S&amp;L bailout. It includes an agreement by the RTC to pay $21 million
into American Continental's bankruptcy estate in exchange for being
allowed to become a party in civil lawsuits filed by bondholders
against Keating and his associates.

<TEXT>
   Top officials from both the Bush
administration and Wall Street declared Friday that major surgery
is needed to treat the ills of the nation's banking and financial
system.
   And they stepped up their calls for action by Congress to deal
with financial problems they say go beyond the current slump in the
economy and the savings and loan crisis.
   ``The legal and regulatory structure of our financial system is
outmoded, burdensome and inefficient,'' said Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady, addressing the annual convention of the Securities
Industry Association, Wall Street's main trade group. ``Fundamental
reforms are needed.''
   ``The issue is not whether we should reform the financial
system,'' asserted Richard Breeden, chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. ``The question is how.''
   ``We need to have a financial summit,'' said Gedale Horowitz,
senior executive director of Salomon Brothers Inc., who took over
Friday as chairman of the SIA for 1991.
   Their statements came a day after President Bush indicated his
support for a drive to rewrite the rules under which American
banks, investment firms and other financial businesses operate.
   The Treasury is working on a detailed proposal, due out in
January, for changes in the financial laws. Bush said Thursday he
would take a ``leadership role'' in bringing the matter before
Congress.
   Among the prime subjects being examined is reform of the federal
deposit insurance system, which has been cited by many observers as
a key factor in the S&amp;L crisis.
   Brady also spoke Friday of giving close scrutiny to decades-old
rules that set barriers between banks and brokerage firms, and that
restrict interstate activities by banks.
   Prospects for early action on any of these ideas by Congress
remain hazy, especially given the apparent onset of a recession and
uncertainties raised by the showdown in the Persian Gulf.
   But proponents of prompt action on financial reform say economic
woes and competition from financial institutions based in other
countries, among other things, are only likely to worsen the
situation as time passes.
   ``If we don't bring about this change in 1991, then when?''
Horowitz said.
   ``Every day we read about layoffs in securities firms, another
troubled bank, a higher estimate of the cost of the savings and
loan bailout. Every day without financial systems reform costs
American taxpayers more money.''
