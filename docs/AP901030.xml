   Mike Tyson took off his jacket and stepped into
the witness box Tuesday to deny allegations that he assaulted a
woman at a Manhattan dance club where, he said, boxing fans mobbed
him all night like ``an army of ants.''
   In a $4.5 million civil lawsuit, Sandra Miller, a 26-year-old
Brooklyn woman, alleges that the former heavyweight champion
``forcibly fondled'' and cursed at her after she refused his
advances at Bentley's Disco early Dec. 10, 1988.
   In a soft, assured voice, Tyson disputed all her allegations and
said he didn't even recognize Miller.
   ``Did you grab her buttock?'' asked his attorney, Robert Hirth.
   ``No I did not,'' Tyson testified.
   He gave the same answer when Hirth asked him about Miller's
other charges that Tyson grabbed her arm, breasts and threatened to
punch her.
   ``The only thing I know is that I didn't touch this lady,''
Tyson said.
   Tyson, who described himself as a frequent patron of Bentley's,
said he went to the club with two men who work for him and was
mobbed by fans and friends from his old neighborhood in Brooklyn.
   The boxer said he bought several bottles of champagne for people
at the bar and drank one toast with them.
   Tyson said he buys drinks for people who approach him at clubs
as a way to get rid of them. ``They gang up on you like an army of
ants,'' he said.
   Lawyers were expected to present closing arguments on Wednesday
in the jury trial in U.S. District Court.
   On Monday, Miller's attorney, Alan Clark, told jurors that the
incident began at a downstairs bar when Tyson grabbed Miller's arm
and pulled her. He quoted Miller as saying, ``I'm a lady and treat
me like a lady. Furthermore I have a man.''
   Clark said she walked away after Tyson angrily asked her whether
she knew who he was.
   A short time later, Clark alleged that Tyson again approached
Miller and grabbed her buttock and then her breast, cursing at her
and yelling, ``Don't you know I'm the world heavyweight champion?''
   A third encounter occurred later that night in an upstairs
lounge, where Tyson again cursed at her and shoved her, Clark said.

   A civilian Army employee who was handcuffed and
removed from his office for threatening to go public says many Army
helicopters lack equipment that would protect them from Iraqi
heat-seeking missiles.
   A colleague says the man was a scapegoat in a cover-up of
problems in Army aircraft safety.
   Army officials said they suspected Calvin J. Weber of the Army
Aviation Systems Command here had planned to disclose sensitive
information about equipment vulnerability.
   Weber said many of the approximately 95 Vietnam-era Huey
helicopters used by American forces in Operation Desert Shield lack
modern equipment designed to fool heat-seeking missles.
   He said he suspected that only about a third of the more modern
Blackhawk helicopters had up-to-date anti-missile gear and some
Cobra attack helicopters also lack the equipment.
   It would cost about $40,000 to add the anti-missile device to
each Huey, Weber said. The devices either disperse the exhaust of
the helicopter's engine - making detection by a heat-seeking
missile more difficult - or provide a decoy heat source that
confuses a missile's guidance system, he said.
   ``Missile systems have advanced, but the Army has trodded and
plodded, and was lax in taking care of equipment with the latest
protection available,'' Weber told a reporter for the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch last week. He said he began warning Defense
Department officials of the potential danger two years ago.
   Weber, 48, was handcuffed and carried from his job at the Army
Aviation Systems Command when he refused to leave, and was charged
with disorderly conduct and two other misdemeanors. He faces a
court date Nov. 16.
   The Army said the veteran of 16 years working for the Army was
to be fired as of Wednesday after colleagues removed his personal
belongings from his desk.
   Army officials, citing privacy regulations, have refused to
discuss details of Weber's case.
   Dick Mooy, a senior engineer with the aviation command who is
helping Weber in an effort to keep his job, said the command is
``despotic'' and ``interested only in itself.''
   Mooy said he had worked for the Army as a civilian for 22 years,
working mostly with Army helicopters and other aircraft. He said he
had known Weber for years and described him as an expert on
helicopter survivability.
   Mooy said he agreed with Weber's contention that many of the
Army helicopters sent to Saudi Arabia in Operation Desert Shield
lacked the full range of equipment needed to thwart heat-seeking
missiles.
   Both engineers said the Army had accused Weber of keeping $1,500
worth of Army helicopter screws at his house. Mooy said a
supervisor had not objected to Weber's having them.
   Mooy added that Army Mohawk surveillance airplanes, including
some in Saudi Arabia, might be a danger to themselves.
   He said an infrared suppressor for that aircraft was prone to
come apart and damage the plane's rudder.
   ``I call this, as an engineer, a big cover-up in the Army,''
Mooy said. ``Cal tried for years to go through channels, but it
came to a dead end.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Louisiana Desegregation Lawsuit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday dismissed a
16-year-old lawsuit on desegregation of Louisiana colleges and
universities, siding with the state over the U.S. Justice
Department.
   The judge cited a recent appeals court ruling that colleges in
Mississippi were not intentionally segregated. He said that ruling
was ``binding and controlling'' in the Louisiana case.
   The Justice Department, which filed the Louisiana lawsuit in
1974, was the only party still contending the state is running a
segregated higher education system.
   Amy Casner, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said agency
officials would have to review the ruling before commenting on
whether they will appeal.
   In the Mississippi case, a three-judge panel of the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last month that Mississippi, which
has an open admissions policy, offered ``real freedom of choice''
for students to pick their schools and no longer was intentionally
running a desegregated system.
   Louisiana also has an open admissions policy, but enrollment at
historically black Southern University and Grambling State
University remain almost all black. Blacks are in the minority at
Louisiana State and seven other of the state's 17 colleges and
universities.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz, in a two-paragraph order
said the appeals court ruling in the Mississippi case left him with
``no disputed material facts left ... to resolve.''
   State and federal authorities thought they had settled the case
in 1981 with a consent decree in which the state agreed to pour
hundreds of millions of dollars into Grambling and Southern to
improve buildings, equipment and programs and to make the two
schools more attractive to whites.
   By 1988, black leaders and the Justice Department concluded the
consent decree had failed. A three-judge panel led by Schwartz
agreed the system was still segregated and issued its own sweeping
desegregation plan.
   That plan called for a single governing board to replace four
boards that oversee the Louisiana schools.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer had long embraced the single-board idea, but
his administration appealed the plan on grounds that Louisiana's
colleges and universities are not segregated. Those appeals were
pending when Schwartz dismissed the lawsuit.

   Former District of Columbia Police Chief
Maurice Turner said Tuesday that Mayor Marion Barry was the target
of several undercover drug operations when Turner was police chief.
   Up to now, only one investigation of Barry, the one that led to
his arrest, conviction and six-months prison sentence, had been
revealed.
   ``I was aware of the rumors and innuendos surrounding the
mayor,'' Turner, now a Republican mayoral candidate, said during a
campaign forum on WJLA-TV. ``There were several aggressive grand
juries that were seated, and there were stings that didn't
materialize.''
   In other news about Barry's case, the judge at his trial was
quoted as telling a law school audience in Cambridge, Mass. he
thought the case against Barry was ``overwhelming'' on 10 of the 14
counts, and believed that four jurors were determined to acquit
Barry, no matter what the evidence.
   Those four ``obviously did not tell the truth'' when they said
they would approach the case without bias, said U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson in a speech at Harvard Law School,
according to a dispatch from Cambridge in Wednesday editions of The
Washington Post.
   ``I am quite sure that neither race nor politics played any
part'' in the case, said Jackson.
   Many of the mayor's supporters have accused government
prosecutors of targeting black officials like Barry in corruption
investigations. Barry and Turner are black; Jackson is white.
   Turner declined to provide details on the sting operations
against Barry, which he first mentioned in response to a question
about whether he would have approved such a tactic against his
then-boss.
   ``The stings were field operations, and I don't want to go into
it,'' Turner said. ``I do approve of sting operations, though.''
   Turner, who served 32 years on the police force with the last
eight as chief, added that he would not have ``sacrificed my career
for someone using drugs.''
   The former chief declined to say whether the operations were
coordinated with federal officials or whether his department was
acting alone.
   The federal investigation that led to Barry's arrest, in
cooperation with city police, began in December 1988 when officials
started looking into why city police called off an undercover drug
purchase at a hotel after discovering that Barry was in the
suspect's room.
   Turner was police chief then. A hotel manager testified later
that he, the manager, blocked the undercover purchase because he
feared the publicity that would result if the mayor were involved.
   Barry was arrested Jan. 18 this year after FBI agents made a
secret videotape of him smoking crack cocaine in the hotel room of
one of Barry's former girlfriends, who had cooperated with
investigators.
   The mayor was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine possession
charge, and acquitted of another after a two-month trial this
summer. The jury failed to agree on a dozen other charges,
including the possession charge stemming from Barry's arrest.
   Last Friday, Barry was sentenced to six months in prison.
   Turner, a former Democrat, is considered a long shot to win next
Tuesday's mayoral election against Democrat Sharon Pratt Dixon.
Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 9-1 margin in the nation's
capital.

   For the first time in five months,
all three of NASA's space shuttles have been cleared for flight,
with Atlantis due to lift off next week and Columbia in December.
   Columbia was found to be free of dangerous hydrogen leaks during
an elaborate fueling test Tuesday. The spaceship has been grounded
since May.
   ``Obviously, we have had some problems we've had to work,'' said
shuttle director Bob Crippen. ``That perhaps took us longer than
some people thought it would, but it was a tough set of problems we
were working.''
   Atlantis, also crippled by hydrogen leaks over the summer,
passed a fueling test last week. The shuttle is scheduled to lift
off Nov. 9 with a satellite that reportedly will spy on Iraq.
   The tests gave a lift to NASA, which has sent up only one
shuttle, Discovery, since April. Discovery earlier this month sent
a probe on a mission to explore the sun.
   ``Launching space shuttles and reputation, they are tied
together,'' said launch director Bob Sieck. ``Safely and
successfully carrying out these missions, which is our goal, is
only going to help the reputation and our cause to keep the program
going.''
   During Tuesday's three-hour test, Columbia's external tank was
filled with more than 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen. A small
amount of hydrogen escaped into the engine compartment but was well
within allowable limits.
   It was NASA's most extensive fueling test of a shuttle. Ten TV
cameras and 17 sensors were mounted in Columbia's engine
compartment to detect leaks.
   NASA had tried four times to launch Columbia with the $150
million Astro observatory.
   Fuel lines and other parts were replaced and numerous joints
tightened. Officials believe workers accidentally damaged
components in Columbia while searching for contamination after the
shuttle's last flight, in January.
   Columbia could be launched in early December if Atlantis goes up
on time, Crippen said. That will allow NASA to finish the year with
six shuttle missions, three fewer than planned.

<HEAD>Smith, as Attorney General, Helped Guide Sharp Change in Federal
Policy</HEAD>

   William French Smith helped guide Ronald
Reagan from Hollywood to the White House and then drastically
revised federal policy on crime, civil rights and corporate mergers
during his tenure as attorney general.
   Born Aug. 26, 1917, in Wilton, N.H., to an aristocratic Yankee
family, Smith pursued an impeccable establishment career in
corporate law, deviating from his heritage only in his adoption of
Los Angeles as his home.
   He died of cancer Monday in Los Angeles. He was 73.
   Indeed, there was little in his background, personality and
early public appearances to foreshadow the sweeping changes he
would make when he took office as the nation's 74th attorney
general in January 1981.
   A specialist in corporate relations with labor, Smith was
managing partner of the prestigious Los Angeles law firm of Gibson,
Dunn &amp; Crutcher when Reagan named him attorney general.
   Smith had been with the firm since he began his career in 1946.
During that time he had become Reagan's personal attorney and
helped guide the investments that turned the actor into a
millionaire.
   He also had become a key behind-the-scenes political adviser as
Reagan sought first the California governorship and then the
presidency. He served as the informal chairman of a group of
California millionaires, known as the ``Kitchen Cabinet,'' who saw
Reagan socially, boosted his political fortunes and helped pick his
first Cabinet.
   But at his confirmation hearings, the publicity-shy Smith
responded to virtually every question by saying he would have to
study the matter.
   Early in his tenure, he confided that it was not until shortly
before taking office that he realized the Immigration and
Naturalization Service was part of the Department of Justice. He
noticed it on the INS seal as he crossed the border when returning
from a short trip to Mexico.
   And a magazine story early in his tenure at Justice quoted an
administration official as calling him a ``somnambulist,'' or
sleepwalker, a description that rankled him.
   But if he started slower than his predecessors, Smith altered
more department policies more sharply than any attorney general in
a generation.
   Among the changes in which he played a key role were:
   -The appointment of the first woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, to the
Supreme Court.
   -Bringing the FBI for the first time into drug enforcement, a
move previous administrations had considered but shield away from.
   -Legislation overturning a 100-year-old ban on military aid to
civilian law enforcement. He brought the military into tracking
planes and ships smuggling cocaine and marijuana from South
America.
   -Advocating the most extensive immigration law revisions in
three decades; though he left office before Congress finished
acting on them.
   -The relaxation of rules against corporate mergers, which had
not been changed in 15 years. This helped set off a wave of
mergers.
   -A halt to the Justice Department's advocacy of mandatory busing
to desegregate schools and of hiring and promotion goals to remedy
job discrimination. In this, he changed policies advocated by four
previous administrations of both parties, but was unable to
convince the Supreme Court to overturn the legal precedents
supporting those remedies.
   A presidential order instituted unprecedented lifetime
censorship for the writings and speeches of former government
officials with access to the most sensitive intelligence and a
major broadening of the use of the polygraph machine in leak
investigations. Congress, however, stepped in to block immediate
implementation of the order.
   The merger policies of his antitrust division infuriated
consumers and liberal Democrats.
   Black groups and women's organizations were outraged over his
civil rights policies. They prevailed in Congress over his
opposition to toughening the Voting Rights Act and in court over
his unprecedented effort to give tax exemptions to racially
discriminatory private schools.
   He also drew a mixture of praise and criticism for being the
first attorney general to view his job as an international one. He
took four major foreign trips to 14 countries, including an
unprecedented round-the-world tour, to encourage foreign officials
to help stop drug-smuggling.
   Drug enforcement officials hailed these efforts. But the
round-the-world jaunt, with his wife, Jean, along at government
expense, cost more than $600,000 and was criticized as extravagant.
His later trips used smaller planes and a reduced entourage,
although his wife still accompanied him.
   Smith's personal finances and patrician style also drew attacks.
   Career department attorneys, many of them opposed to his
policies, jeered his establishment of a second private dining room
at the Justice Department and his regular appearances on the
Washington social circuit.
   In 1982, Democrats, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, criticized his investment in two oil and gas tax
shelters and his acceptance of a $50,000 severance payment when he
left the board of directors of the Earle M. Jorgensen Steel Co. to
become attorney general.
   Smith defused that controversy by agreeing to return the $50,000
and limit his tax deductions in the two ventures to the amount of
his cash investment.
   Smith seemed surprised at these criticisms, for he was
unaccustomed to public scrutiny of his personal life.
   He was born into wealth. His father, who died when Smith was 6
years old, owned the Mexican telephone and telegraph company and
battled the revolutionary Pancho Villa. One ancestor arrived in
this country aboard the Mayflower; another, Uriah Oakes, was the
fourth president of Harvard, which has educated a Smith in every
generation.
   He graduated with highest honors from the University of
California at Berkeley in 1939, received his law degree from
Harvard in 1942 and spent four years as a Navy lieutenant during
World War II. He then joined Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher.
   It was to that firm and private life that he returned when he
announced his surprise resignation in January 1984. Asserting that
he had completed much of what he wanted to do, Smith said he also
wanted to resume his behind-the-scenes work on behalf of Reagan,
who was then seeking re-election to the presidency.

   Republicans marked Democratic Rep. Jolene
Unsoeld for defeat as soon as she squeaked into Congress in the
closest U.S. House race of 1988.
   Now, Unsoeld's political future appears tied to an issue that
didn't even exist two years ago.
   Unsoeld was a staunch supporter of gun control as a state
legislator, but as a freshman member of Congress she's championed
the views of the National Rifle Association.
   The apparent about-face has become the hottest campaign issue in
her race against conservative Republican Bob Williams, a longtime
advocate of gun owners' rights.
   ``She has managed to raise the whole issue of integrity and
what's wrong with Congress,'' Williams says. ``They go back there
and suddenly they become different people. They're not one of us.''
   Sarah Brady, chairwoman of the Handgun Control Inc. lobby group
in Washington, D.C., said Unsoeld ``sold her political soul to the
assault-weapons lobby in the hope it will get her re-elected.''
   Unsoeld, who won her seat by 618 votes in the closest House race
i 1988, stoutly defends her pro-NRA position, calling gun
ownership a constitutional issue. In the Legislature, she says, she
viewed it as a crime issue.
   ``I am extremely outraged at my opponent's deliberate
misrepresentation of my position and suggestion that my views or
actions can be influenced by money or threats,'' Unsoeld has said.
``Because some people thought they knew what my position was on gun
control, they found it painful to discover otherwise.''
   The most scathing attacks have come from her longtime allies -
liberal Democrats, the Common Cause citizens lobby, gun-control
groups and the media.
   One political cartoonist drew Unsoeld as a machine gun-toting
Rambo and The Seattle Times editorialized against her
``unconscionable sellout.''
   Her high-profile switch touched off an ad war between the NRA
and Brady's group: The former portrays her as an American heroine,
the latter as a defender of the arsenals used by crack dealers,
mass murderers and hate groups.
   State Democratic leaders admit the change in position will hurt
Unsoeld.
   ``What it's going to cost her, I don't know,'' said state party
chairwoman Karen Marchioro.
   Even before the gun-control question heated up, Unsoeld was
under fire from timber industry advocates who objected to her
support for protecting the old-growth forest habitat of the
endangered spotted owl.
   An Oct. 24-25 poll conducted for the National Republican
Congressional Committee showed the race a dead heat, with Unsoeld
favored by 36 percent of those surveyed and Williams by 40 percent
and 25 percent undecided. The survey had a 5.7 percentage point
margin of error.
   The gun-control issue surfaced this fall when Unsoeld championed
an amendment protecting the domestic manufacture of assault weapons
similar to the foreign-made Uzi and AK-47.
   The amendment, considered the major gun vote of the year, passed
the House, 257-172, earlier this month. The crime bill to which it
was attached passed a day later.
   A transcript of the House Rules Committee shows that Unsoeld
requested permission Sept. 12 for a vote on the amendment.
According to a letter on file with the Federal Election Commission,
she received a $4,950 contribution from the NRA the same day.
   ``The timing was extraordinarily bad,'' says Democratic state
Sen. Phil Talmadge.
   Unsoeld is swamping Williams in finances. Her contributions,
including those from political action committees, come to about
$825,000, compared with about $472,000 for Williams.
   Williams, an accountant, has been endorsed by Gun Owners of
America, which says it represents ``100,000 of the most pro-gun
households in the nation.''
   That group says it's ``not impressed with Mrs. Unsoeld's support
for a minor amendment.''

<HEAD>Cocaine-Alcohol Combination Produces Third Drug in Body, Scientists
Say</HEAD>

   Drinking alcohol while using cocaine makes the
body produce a third substance that may yield a greater high but
may also raise the risk of death by overdose, scientists say.
   The research, together with a preliminary finding that drinking
boosts the risk of a fatal cocaine overdose about 20-fold in people
with severe coronary heart disease, may help explain the puzzling
overdose deaths in people with surprisingly little of the drug in
their blood at autopsy.
   New studies show that this third substance, manufactured in the
liver from cocaine and alcohol, can mimic some actions of cocaine
in the brain. Drinking is frequently combined with cocaine use,
according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
   Researchers spoke in telephone interviews about studies that
were presented Monday at the annual meeting of the Society for
Neuroscience in St. Louis.
   The substance is a close chemical cousin of cocaine called
cocaethylene. Further studies of it may give leads for medications
to treat cocaine addiction by blocking cocaine's effects, said
study co-author Deborah Mash, a neuropharmacologist at the
University of Miami School of Medicine.
   Scientists found that cocaethylene affects a brain-cell
communication system thought to produce the euphoria that leads to
cocaine addiction, she said.
   Prior research suggests that cocaine produces its high by
intervening in this system, in which brain cells signal each other
with a chemical called dopamine. After a dose of dopamine reaches
its target cell, it is supposed to be brought back to its original
home by molecules called transporters. But cocaine blocks this
mechanism by binding to transporters, keeping the signal turned
``on'' and producing a sense of pleasure, scientists say.
   The new work shows that cocaethylene also binds to the
transporters, suggesting it may boost cocaine's effect, Mash said.
In addition, she said, it appears less able than cocaine to
moderate the euphoria through a second brain communication system.
   Another possible role of cocaethylene deals with cocaine
overdose deaths in people with severe coronary artery disease.
   The overdose study found no elevated risk for people with
moderate or mild coronary disease, said co-author Dr. James
Ruttenber of the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
   The study included about 240 cases of fatal cocaine overdose and
a comparable number of deaths from other causes in people who had
taken cocaine, Ruttenber said.
   Mash said cocaethylene might play a role in the elevated risk
because it can cling to brain cell sites that are supposed to
attract a brain-communication substance called acetylcholine.
   This may interfere with the brain's control of the heart pumping
rhythm, she said. If the heart is already affected by heart
disease, the result could be sudden death, she suggested.
   Ruttenber said that less than 20 percent of overdose deaths in
the study involved severe heart disease and that it is not clear
whether cocaethylene contributed to the elevated risk.
   But if it did, he said, it may also play a role in the more
common puzzle of overdose deaths in people with surprisingly little
cocaine in their blood.
   About 40 percent of overdose deaths in the study fit that
category, and it has been noticed before, he said.
   For cocaine users, he said, such cases suggests that ``even if
they are careful about the quantities of cocaine they use, they
still may not be able to ward off a fatal overdose.''
   Michael Kuhar, a NIDA neuroscientist who did not participate in
the studies, said the suggested roles for cocaethylene are
plausible. It is ``a new entity we don't know much about,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Hindu holy men and their
followers broke through police barricades Tuesday and stormed
toward the Moslem mosque they want to replace with a Hindu temple.
   Many were beaten back by police who fired tear gas and lashed
out with iron-tipped bamboo canes. Dozens were injured. Hindu holy
men screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted the police with
stones.
   About 200 people overran police lines in the narrow lanes and
were halted at the foot of the hill just 600 feet from the mosque.
   The religious dispute has made the name of this Hindu holy town
a battle cry in Moslem-Hindu riots that have left more than 100
dead across India in the past week.
   The dispute threatens to topple the government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh. A right-wing Hindu party withdrew its support for Singh
last week when his government tried to deter plans to build new
Hindu temple where the mosque now stands.
   Ayodhya had been under around-the-clock curfew since Friday in
an effort to keep Hindu fundamentalists from carrying out their vow
to begin construction of the temple Tuesday.
   Roads leading to the 16th century mosque were blocked, but about
5,000 people emerged from hiding places in fields around Ayodhya
before sunrise and stormed a bridge leading into the town.
   Police arrested between 100 and 200 people and rained blows with
their bamboo canes on fallen members of the crowd. The 600
policemen on the mile-long bridge eventually turned back the crowd.
   Inside Ayodhya, a town of about 40,000 people, reporters saw
some members of the state police force lift barricades and let
Hindu holy men run into the lanes leading to the mosque. The
infiltrators were halted short of the mosque by federal
paramilitary police.
   On Monday, a group of about 80 Hindu holy men in Ayodhya threw
stones at police and set a bus on fire when authorities attempted
to arrest a local Hindu priest, a police inspector said.
   The inspector, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said it was
an isolated incident and did not cause any lasting tension.
   But within an hour of the skirmish, authorities banned entry
into Ayodhya and canceled passes issued to reporters.
   Despite the efforts to deter them and the presence of 20,000
police and paramilitary troops in town, the Hindu fundamentalists
vowed to start the temple construction program as scheduled.
   In New Delhi on Monday, the World Hindu Council had claimed
10,000 supporters had slipped through police cordons and roadblocks
around Ayodhya.
   The exact time for the start of construction has not been
announced.
   In New Delhi, Prime Minister Singh offered to resign if the
Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party, which supports the
temple construction program, would accept a legal verdict on the
dispute.
   Singh's National Front coalition was relegated to a minority in
Parliament last week after Bharatiya Janata withdrew its support to
the government. Singh has maintained he still holds a parliamentary
majority and is scheduled to seek a vote of confidence on Nov. 7.
   The government has vowed to block the temple construction and
said a court of law should decide who the site belongs to.
   The fundamentalists claim the mosque stands atop the very spot
where Rama, one of the most worshipped Hindu gods, was born and
therefore is a religious matter, not a legal one.
   Moslems, a minority in officially secular but predominantly
Hindu India, fear the displacement of one mosque could jeopardize
hundreds of other Islamic sites across the country.
   On Friday the government of Uttar Pradesh state imposed an
around-the-clock curfew in Ayodhya in an effort to keep temple
advocates from reaching the disputed hilltop. Trains to the area
were halted and roads blocked by police and paramilitary troops.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people, of
whom 82 percent are Hindu. In Uttar Pradesh state, where the
government is allied with Singh, Moslems account for about 30
percent of the 120 million people.

<HEAD>Skinny-Dipping, Philandering Claims Top String of Minnesota
Scandals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget that picture of clean-cut
Minnesota politics. This year it's alleged skinny-dipping with
teen-age girls and financial impropriety.
   The troubles of Republicans Jon Grunseth, Rep. Arlan Stangeland
and Sen. Dave Durenberger have turned the state's Lake Wobegon-like
image into Minnesota mud.
   Political sleaze has found a new home.
   ``The tragedies of this year would be extraordinary in any age,
but they're a culmination of what I see as a general level of
conduct which is not nearly as good as we think it is,'' former St.
Paul Mayor George Latimer said Monday. ``I think it will be
followed by a lot of serious reappraisal.''
   Grunseth quit the governor's race Sunday amid allegations he
swam nude with teen-age girls nine years ago and had an
extramarital affair during both of his marriages.
   Stangeland used his congressional credit card to pay for more
than 400 long-distance telephone calls to and from a woman's home
and office.
   And the Senate in July found that Durenberger had engaged in
unethical financial conduct.
   That's not all. There have been:
   -Sexual harassment allegations against Democratic Gov. Rudy
Perpich's former chief of staff.
   -The indictment of a close Perpich political associate in
connection with an S&amp;L's failure.
   -The resignation of a popular state representative as head of
the powerful Minnesota House Appropriations Committee after
pleading guilty to charges stemming from his solicitation of males
for sex.
   -Accusations that another state representative diverted about
$93,000 of clients' money to his own use while acting as their
financial planner. He resigned and pleaded guilty to four counts of
felony theft.
   Grunseth denied the nude-swimming allegations, the former
Perpich aide maintains his innocence and the S&amp;L case has yet to be
resolved. Stangeland says even the late-night phone calls were
business-related.
   But the good-government image of Minnesota is gone.
   The scandals and the negative tone of the 1990 governor's race
will lead to greater scrutiny of potential candidates, predicts
D.J. Leary, a Democratic political analyst.
   ``Parties will be extraordinarily careful about doing the
fingernail test in future elections,'' Leary said. ``They
(candidates) may have to bring some proven credentials in some
other field, if not in government, where both the public and
private self has been under scrutiny for a number of years.''
   Even before the nude-swimming allegations against Grunseth,
Minnesota voters were complaining about the negative tone of the
1990 governor's race.
   Perpich had traveled the state distributing court documents
pertaining to Grunseth's divorce disputes with his first wife and
Perpich surrogates had criticized Grunseth for some tardy property
tax payments.
   Grunseth accused Perpich of orchestrating the skinny-dipping
allegations and called the governor ``the supreme liar,'' although
he offered no proof to back his claim.
   ``I keep hoping that we've hit bottom, but I don't see any signs
of it,'' said Latimer. ``Negative campaigning works, and it works
in Minnesota. The question becomes, how effective can negativism be
and not bring the wrath of voters against a candidate who uses
them.''
   Observers of the Minnesota political scene disagree about what
it the year's events mean.
   ``I think Minnesota is still the kind of state it has been, and
the fact there was such an outpouring of objection to Grunseth is
an indication of the virtue of the state, rather than the
opposite,'' said former Republican Gov. Elmer L. Andersen.
   Minnesota voters expect honesty and dedication from their public
servants and they ``react pretty vigorously to any departure from
it,'' Andersen said. ``I don't think Minnesota is changing much.
Unfortunately, there have been a number of incidents.''
   Latimer, a Democrat, looks at it differently.
   Minnesota residents ``have been living off our past reputation,
and increasingly the evidence does not support that reputation,''
he said.
   There's been a tendency to overstate Minnesota as a
good-government state with innocent, hard-working,
not-too-sophisticated people who are honest, loyal and brave,
Latimer said.
   ``It's a little smug to say we are so good we're still shocked
by the bad,'' he said. ``For years we've been saying that, but the
simple fact is, what happened to Dave Durenberger is not just
extraordinary for the state of Minnesota, it's extraordinary in the
U.S. Senate.
   ``We are not as good as we pretend to be, as we should be, as we
ought to be in our level of public conduct,'' Latimer said.

   Advocates for the poor are hailing a series of
new benefits in Medicaid and other programs that Congress included
with the tax increases and spending cuts in the deficit-reduction
bill.
   Thousands of families will be aided by the expanded programs,
under which the government will foot doctors' bills for more
low-income families and for mammograms performed on older women.
   Large portions of the billions of dollars of new spending will
be spent on families who work but who remain needy.
   ``The common theme that connects a lot of this is that it is
aimed at low-and moderate-income families,'' said Robert
Greenstein, executive director of the Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities, a Washington-based advocacy group for the poor.
   One of the most dramatic increases is for Medicaid, which helps
low-income Americans pay their medical expenses. It will allow the
program for the first time to cover all children below age 19 whose
families are below the poverty level.
   Currently, poor children younger than age 6 are covered. Most of
those covered above that age belong to families on welfare, leaving
out those in families who earn just enough not to qualify for
welfare.
   The change would be phased in gradually, initially adding only
7-year-olds to the program and progressing to children one year
older each year.
   The eventual effect is expected to be enormous. Officials
believe 704,000 additional children will receive Medicaid benefits
by 1995, costing the government $560 million during the next five
years.
   ``It's a terrific step forward,'' said Marian Wright Edelman,
president of the Children's Defense Fund.
   Lawmakers also decided to expand Medicaid's coverage of the
elderly poor.
   The government will spend $580 million over the next five years
to help senior citizens receive care in their own homes, adult
day-care centers or group homes.
   It will also put up $387 million to pay the monthly Medicare
premium for doctors' expenses - an out-of-pocket cost for most
Medicare recipients - for many of the poorest elderly.
   In a separate $100 million effort, the government will provide
at-home care for retarded people.
   Overall, the deficit-reduction bill envisions additional
Medicaid spending of $2.3 billion through 1995.
   But since the bill also contains savings of $2.9 billion over
the next five years, there would be a net reduction in Medicaid of
$600 million. The savings come largely from requiring drug
companies to lower their prices for Medicaid recipients and by
savings on insurance costs.
   The deficit-reduction bill also included:
   -A $22 billion child-care package containing tax credits and
grants, with most of the money directed to the working poor.
   -New restrictions on private firms that sell health insurance
policies to the elderly, an industry that has been accused of
frequent abuses.
   -$2.1 billion in new spending under Medicare, which provides
money for medical costs of elderly and handicapped. The chief new
help for them allows coverage for mammograms, or breast X-rays.
Until now, the program only provided reimbursements for women
having mammograms if disease was suspected. Overall, the growth of
Medicare is being reduced by $44 billion.
   -$740 million in new Social Security spending. A major change is
the easing of the conditions under which a widow or widower can
receive disability benefits. Cuts in other parts of Social Security
yield a net savings in the program of $85 million.

<HEAD>Religious Belief High in Eastern Europe Despite Years of
Repression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL PUTZEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Religious faith in Eastern Europe remains
strong despite years of official repression under communist
regimes, according to polling data gathered by the Gallup
organization.
   Gordon Heald, the London-based director of Gallup's
international arm, told The Associated Press his studies indicate
that religious belief in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and the Soviet
republic of Lithuania closely parallels that of Western Europe and
the Nordic countries.
   Fewer people go to church in the former communist countries,
where religious activity was often punished, than attend services
in Western Europe. But the percentage of people who describe
themselves as religious is quite comparable, Heald said.
   In a continuing study of people's values, the pollster reported,
he has found a striking difference between East and West in the
trust that citizens place in various institutions.
   Personal interviews with 1,000 randomly selected Lithuanians
showed they place their highest confidence in the church, the
Lithuanian legislature that has led a drive for independence from
Soviet rule and in the Lithuanian news media.
   In Hungary, where the press and broadcasters are perceived as
having taken a leading role in bringing down the communist regime,
the media hold the highest confidence rating of all institutions
checked, Heald said. The church, with 67 percent of respondents
giving it their vote of confidence, ranked 5 percentage points
below the media but 5 points above the government. The army,
parliament, police and Communist Party lagged behind the
government.
   The courts, police, military and the KGB secret police rank with
the Soviet Communist Party and private cooperative businesses at
the bottom of the confidence scale in Lithuania, Heald reported.
Previous Gallup studies have shown that the armed forces, police
and the legal system are among the most highly respected
institutions in the United States, Canada and Europe.
   The polling specialist presented his findings about the status
of religion in Eastern Europe to a symposium last week at
Georgetown University.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, he explained the
samples taken so far show that 45 percent of ethnic Lithuanians, 49
percent of Czechoslovaks and 56 percent of Hungarians still
consider themselves religious. The predominant religion in all
three areas is Roman Catholicism. Heald's tables show 62 percent of
Western Europeans but only 46 percent of Scandinavians consider
themselves religious.
   Surveys in the United States show 81 percent of Americans
consider themselves religious.
   Although the number of self-described non-religious people was
somewhat higher in the formerly communist countries of Hungary and
Czechoslovakia than in Western Europe, the number of ``convinced
atheists'' in Lithuania was between 2 and 4 percent, compared to 5
percent in all of Western Europe and 10 percent in France alone,
Heald found.
   Public opinion polling is still relatively new to the Soviet
Union, and findings often are unscientific. Heald said he has had
particular difficulty gathering reliable data in the Russian
republic but that his Lithuanian polling operation has worked well.
   Marxist doctrine denounced religion as an ``opiate of the
masses,'' and thousands of clergy were executed or imprisoned
during the Stalin years. Proselytizing was officially forbidden,
and churchgoers were subject to intimidation by secret police. In
the Soviet Union and several Soviet bloc countries, thousands of
churches were destroyed or converted to other uses and are only now
being returned to church authorities.
   Although the Russian Orthodox Church continued to operate at
severely reduced levels, Roman Catholic clergy in Lithuania,
Czechoslovakia and elsewhere went underground to continue
practicing their religion clandestinely.
   The Rev. Michael J. Lavelle, president of John Carroll
University and a frequent traveler to Czechoslovakia, told the
symposium that the underground church, cut off from mainstream
theology for 40 years, has emerged from the communist period with
outdated theology and ``a very avant garde religious practice.''
   ``Masses have been said on dining room tables with the priest
wearing no vestment,'' the Jesuit priest said. ``Lay people have
been bringing the sacraments to other people'' in direct violation
of canon law.
   ``People did what they had to do,'' he said, but he added
tensions are likely to arise now, as those who preserved their
religion in secret confront new ideas and the obligations imposed
by the official church hierarchy.
   Lavelle acknowledged that most people in Czechoslovakia have
been baptized as Christians, but he called them ``de facto
atheists.''
   ``They know little about the religion into which they were
baptized,'' he said. ``The major task of the church now is to
evangelize the vast majority of people who have not received any
type of religious instruction since 1950.''

   Farmers complain about the rising cost of
fertilizers and pesticides, and say they'd like the government to
do more research to reduce their need.
   At the same time, however, they're reluctant to give up the
chemicals that have done so much to increase crop yields, despite
the warnings of long-term environmental damage.
   Enter John Colburn of Houston, and his Soil Doctor.
   Colburn's ``prescription application'' computerized equipment is
being eyed by experts at the Environmental Protection Agency as a
good way to reduce ground water pollution caused by excessive
fertilization.
   The 1990 farm bill requires the Agriculture Department to teach
farmers and agrichemical dealers how to use chemicals in ``prudent,
economical and environmentally sound'' ways.
   Dr. Lloyd Murdock, a soil specialist at the University of
Kentucky who works as an extension agent for USDA, said Colburn's
instrument ``looked pretty good'' for conserving chemical
fertilizers.
   Murdock conducted a one-year test using the instrument on a
farmer's corn field near the university.
   Colburn, president of Crop Technology Inc., said his idea
originally was to save farmers money, but his equipment ``addresses
environmental issues, too.''
   The machinery costs about $13,000, but it can pay for itself in
two years through the $20 to $25 an acre a farmer saves in
fertilizers, he said.
   The problem has been with farmers who apply fertilizer in
quantities large enough to account for runoff from heavy rains.
Since not every part of a farmer's land is equally productive, the
grower also usually measures his chemicals for the least productive
areas without accounting for any residual nitrates still there from
the last planting.
   These practices can lead to a lot of unnecessary nitrates in the
soil and eventually into groundwater.
   The EPA says 10 micrograms of nitrate per liter of water is
considered the limit for the most vulnerable humans - babies, for
example.
   Meanwhile, some crops grow best with 22 to 24 micrograms of
nitrates per liter.
   Colburn's equipment, which he calls the Soil Doctor, uses two
computers to regulate the amount of fertilizer applied. It can be
installed on the farmer's existing equipment.
   Simply put, a prober on the front of the tractor tests the soil
as the farmer drives along, telling a computer in the cab how much
fertilizer to release out the back of the vehicle.
   Colburn said his system has been under development since 1984
and tested extensively in the Midwest. About 40 have been sold for
use this year, he said.
   It's being used exclusively for corn at this time because corn
is the highest nitrate-consuming crop, Colburn said.
   Farmers don't always like computers, he said, ``but this is
fairly well appreciated once a farmer gets behind the wheel.''
   Terry Behymer, of Sterling, Ill., said he has saved money and
increased corn yield with the invention. Last year, he won state
honors for corn growing with 209.5 bushels per acre, and this year
is doing even better with 249.5 bushels an acre.
   Behymer's 700-acre farm grows corn, wheat, soybeans and alfalfa.
He said Colburn's equipment is suitable only for the corn, but it
has enabled him to measure the amount of nitrate appropriate for
each area in his field.
   He said the nitrates in the soil vary depending on which crop
was grown last on the particular acreage.
   Behymer said he wanted something that would tell him how much
nitrate already as in the soil before he applied more.
   Murdock said the nitrate level detected by the Soil Doctor
compared favorably with more conventional testing. He said he was
optimistic about the equipment's value to agriculture.

<HEAD>Moon, Mars Missions Lose to Budget Cutters</HEAD>

   President Bush's most ambitious space proposal
- colonizing the moon and sending a manned expedition to Mars - are
casualties to the deficit-cutting bill approved by Congress.
   Lawmakers were sympathetic to the goals in the 30-year project
as it eliminated the $37 million that the administration had asked
for early studies.
   ``It is implicit in the conduct of the nation's civil space
program that such human exploration of our solar system is
inevitable,'' the budget cutters said. They added that
consideration of the plan was deferred ``due to budget
constraints.''
   In its budget bill, Congress also trimmed more than a
half-billion dollars from the space station program, even as it
increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's total
budget by 13 percent over last year.
   Instead of the $2.4 billion that Bush sought, the station
program will get $1.9 billion.
   Overall, the president had proposed spending $15.1 billion for
NASA, an increase of 24 percent over last year. Congress cut that
amount to $13.8 billion, still considerably more than the $12.2
billion of 1990.
   The legislators cautioned that NASA won't continue to get such
increases in the future and ordered the agency to develop the
station ``in useful phases'' or risk losing the $38 billion project
altogether.
   ``The committees on appropriations have warned since the outset
of this program that future budget costraints would render it
virtually impossible to design, test and build the space station
envisioned in 1984,'' said a report accompanying the budget bill.
   The station was proposed by then-President Reagan, who estimated
its cost to completion at $8 billion.
   ``It is essential that the agency recognize that the budget
crisis is only beginning,'' the report said. In the future, it
said, NASA can expect annual spending growth of only 8 or 10
percent, and the amount spent on the space station should not rise
above that.
   NASA had envisioned using 30 or so shuttle flights to assemble
the station in orbit, beginning midway in the decade, but Congress
said that is unrealistic given the low launch rate of recent years.
   Lawmakers also cut $210 million from research and technology,
leaving $285 million, the same as last year. It trimmed $24 million
from the $119 million requested for the National Aerospace Plane -
the four-hours-to-Tokyo craft promised by Reagan - and $40 million
from science projects.
   NASA's request for $53.9 million to design the next generation
of rockets was cut by $30 million. Congress earmarked $10.5 million
of the remainder for ``shuttle-C'' - in which a cargo carrier would
be launched in the same manner as the shuttle is now.
   Congress deleted all $15 million requested to build a huge water
tank in which astronauts would practice assembling the space
station and cut $125 million from the $4.4 billion requested for
space shuttle operations.
   An additional $25 million was cut from life sciences research,
but Congress specifically set aside $12.1 million for ``the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence.'' NASA maintains huge listening
posts to detect radio signals from outer space.
   There was one significant addition. Congress tacked another $30
million to the $294 million Bush had requested for operating and
upgrading the Hubble Space Telescope.
   The president had made his budget proposals early in the year,
before the telescope was launched. Since then, however, the $1.5
billion instrument has proved to be fuzzy-eyed, due to a mistake in
construction. The new money will provide corrective lenses on a
replacement instrument that will be attached to the telescope in
1993 by astronauts.

   At a military camp in this Mindanao
island town, Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos exhorted troops to
defend the government against coups. But troops had another
question: ``Is he campaigning for president?''
   It is a question increasingly asked as the end of President
Corazon Aquino's term in office, June 1992, draws nearer.
   Regardless of whether he is seeking the office, Ramos has
emerged in public opinion surveys as a leading choice to succeed
Mrs. Aquino, whom he has kept in office through seven military
uprisings in four years.
   At this camp overlooking the Pacific, soldiers pulled aside
reporters traveling with Ramos to ask: ``Is he really running?''
   The 60-year-old West Point graduate avoids committing himself
when asked about his possible presidential aspirations.
   ``Let me do my job as secretary of defense as long as I can
until we have stability,'' Ramos told a local official in this
seaside provincial capital 640 miles southeast of Manila. ``After
that, it's up to the people.''
   But Ramos' almost weekly trips to military camps throughout this
archipelago nation and meetings with local officials have been
widely interpreted as subtle, early campaigning.
   Unlike most of the nearly 10 political figures believed to have
presidential ambitions, Ramos has no political party to back him.
But his position as defense chief enables him to travel nationwide
using government resources and to gain access to the news media
whenever he wants.
   During his visits to the provinces, Ramos carefully avoids any
criticism of the Aquino administration, which he served as military
chief of staff before becoming defense secretary in January 1988.
   But his declarations of support contain an equally subtle
message: that Mrs. Aquino - and by extension Philippine democracy -
survive politically thanks to Ramos.
   ``I assure you that the president will be able to serve up to
the last day of her term in June 1992,'' Ramos told officials here.
``I still come out with a record for the (Defense) Department she
can be proud of.''
   Ramos has carefully cultivated an image as the savior of
democracy since he derailed an alleged coup plot by then Defense
Secretary Juan Ponce Enrile in November 1986.
   Critics in the military claim Ramos, son of a former foreign
minister and cousin of the late President Ferdinand Marcos, was
part of the conspiracy to topple Mrs. Aquino and then switched
sides at the last minute.
   Ramos denies the charge.
   It is unclear where Ramos stands on a range of national issues
apart from defense and security. During provincial visits, Ramos, a
parachutist, scuba diver and inveterate jogger, projects an image
of a vigorous leader in contrast to an incumbent president who is
increasingly seen as passive and indecisive.
   During a recent 36-hour tour of five southern cities, Ramos
attended nine public functions in three cities during the first
day. The last function ended at midnight.
   Five hours later, Ramos was jogging with troops at Davao's Camp
Catitipan. Later, he visited two more provincial cities before
returning to Manila, where he addressed a civic group in the
evening.
   Ramos also promotes an image as a strong anti-Communist and
staunch opponent of those seen as sympathetic to the left.
   ``Sen. (Wigberto) Tanada and all these leftists should see
this,'' Ramos said as he left a wake in Davao for two militiamen
slain by Communist rebels. Tanada is a prominent human rights
lawyer.
   In Dumaguete, local officials told Ramos that a court there had
recently handed down the first conviction of a major Communist
official on rebellion charges since Mrs. Aquino took office.
   ``That's very good,'' Ramos beamed. ``What's the name of the
judge?''
   During his stops, Ramos is warmly received by local officials,
many of whom rarely see national leaders.
   When he arrived in Dumaguete, 400 miles southeast of Manila,
Ramos was welcomed by mayor Agustin Perdices and Negros Oriental
Gov. Emilio Macias who wore T-shirts saying ``Negros is for
Ramos.''
   But local reporters said that the day before, the same two
officials were wearing T-shirts supporting presidential aspirant
Eduardo Cojuangco when his brother came to town.

   Taxpayers will have to spend millions - or
even billions - of dollars more on savings and loan bailouts
because Congress adjourned without providing more money for the
cleanup, analysts and officials say.
   By the time legislators return in January the borrowing
authority of the bailout agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., could
be exhausted. Even then, approval of more money is far from
certain.
   Congress' refusal to act is ``going to cost us additional money.
We're going to have to slow up the resolution of failed thrifts,''
RTC Chairman L. William Seidman said in a telephone interview
Monday.
   But Congress did triple the amount of money for Justice
Department investigations and prosecutions of S&amp;L fraud. The crime
bill passed last weekend included $160 million for Justice
Department S&amp;L investigations in this fiscal year, more than three
times the $50 million allocated last year.
   The RTC already has postponed seeking acquirers for 18 large
S&amp;Ls, said agency spokesman Steven Katsanos. The agency has spent
or committed to spend $43 billion of the $50 billion authorized in
last year's S&amp;L bailout, he said.
   That means the 18 institutions and more than 300 other insolvent
or near-insolvent S&amp;Ls likely will continue to run losses, funding
themselves with high-interest deposits.
   That in turn weakens healthy competitors by forcing them to
raise their deposit rates, raising the specter of additional
failures.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady had asked Congress for $40
billion more to cover losses through September 1991. A measure to
provide $10 billion, enough to cover S&amp;L losses through February,
died in a procedural snarl early Sunday morning.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said Speaker Thomas Foley and other House leaders sought
to avoid a roll call vote on the issue. In the end, because of
House rules, a single objection from Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
was enough to block action.
   Seidman estimated the cost of a three-month delay at $250
million to $300 million. The Congressional Budget Office put it at
$300 million to $400 million, while Bert Ely, a private analyst in
Alexandria, Va., estimated it at $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
   The added cost, although spread over the life of the bailout
program, will make it even harder for the government to meet the
$500 billion deficit-reduction goal in the five-year program
adopted over the weekend.
   The Sunday morning snafu left Bush administration officials and
Democrats blaming each other for the expected consequences.
   Gonzalez said Brady's refusal to testify in support of the
administration's request ``created an unfortunate atmosphere'' for
approval of more money.
   But Desiree Tucker-Sorini, deputy assistant secretary of the
Treasury, said, ``The need for action and the consequences for
failing to act were spelled out in great detail over a period of
months by the (Treasury) secretary and others.''
   Gonzalez pledged speedy action by his committee when Congress
returns.
   The amount of money available for S&amp;L fraud investigations has
been the subject of bitter partisan wrangling.
   Congress authorized $75 million last fiscal year but only
appropriated $50 million when the Bush administration turned down
an extra $25 million.
   Since 1988, federal prosecutors have obtained 338 convictions in
major S&amp;L fraud cases. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has
predicted it could take another five years to clean up the growing
caseload of fraud left in the wake of the widespread collapse of
S&amp;Ls.
   The crime bill approved by Congress contains a number of
provisions to help S&amp;L prosecutors.
   One would offer rewards of up to $50,000 for information leading
to the prosecution of S&amp;L fraud. Whistleblowers also would shre in
a percentage of any embezzled S&amp;L money that was recovered as a
result of information they provided to help trade the funds.
   The crime bill also authorizes court-approved wiretaps of
suspected S&amp;L crooks and expands the number of crimes for which the
Justice Department can seek forfeiture of assets in civil actions.

   Filmmaker Ken Burns, creator of PBS' acclaimed
documentary ``The Civil War,'' blasted American television for
offering ``nearly the same thing everywhere ... on dozens of
clonelike channels.''
   Burns told the National Press Club on Monday that ``a kind of
cultural peerage'' has been conferred on a small group of TV
commentators.
   ``Issues and ideas are merely pushed around the plate, never
digested, by the same people,'' he said.
   ``In the worst of our television, we are addicted to
personality, to the breathless embrace of celebrity, ensuring as we
go a tyranny of the televised over the great mass of the
un-televised.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actors Dennis Weaver and Valerie Harper have
put together some of rock music's biggest names to make an album
and video so they can feed more homeless.
   ``The sad part is, there is a need for that growth because the
hungry part of our population just keeps growing,'' Weaver said
Monday.
   Since the two actors founded Love is Feeding Everyone in 1983,
LIFE has increased its number of meals in Dallas and Los Angeles
from 400 per week to about 104,000.
   Some 26 performers, including rapper M.C. Hammer, the Red Hot
Chili Peppers and Little Richard plan to sing on the album's
feature track, ``Raise the World.''
   Weaver said he and Miss Harper hope to expand the private relief
organization to other cities and raise enough to create an
endowment.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Francis Ford Coppola, the meticulous director
of the ``Godfather'' movies, says the much-awaited third
installment about the Corleone family has finally passed muster.
   Paramount Pictures said Monday ``The Godfather III'' will be
released on Dec. 25. Studio executives viewed an unfinished print
of the film, expected to cost $50 million, over the weekend.
   ``After one of the most intensive production schedules in my
career, I am deeply satisfied that `The Godfather Part III' has
come together in a way that gives me great pride,'' Coppola said in
a statement.
   The last chapter in Coppola's trilogy was to open Thanksgiving,
but production delays forced its postponement. The first two films
won nine Academy Awards and grossed $800 million.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Mary Martin, the star of such Broadway shows
as ``Peter Pan,'' ``The Sound of Music'' and ``South Pacific,'' is
reported to be undergoing tests at a hospital.
   Richard Grant, a spokesman for Miss Martin's son, actor Larry
Hagman, would not disclose the reason for the tests or identify the
hospital Monday.
   The 76-year-old actress became a star of New York theater with
her 1938 appearance in the musical ``Leave It to Me.'' She also
played nurse Nellie Forbush in ``South Pacific'' and Maria in ``The
Sound of Music.''
   She first played Peter Pan on Broadway in 1954.
   Miss Martin was seriously injured in a 1982 taxi-van collision
that killed her manager. Actress Janet Gaynor and her husband,
producer Paul Gregory, were severely injured in the crash.

   APPLE VALLEY, Calif. (AP) - Cowboy star Roy Rogers is back on
his feet after surgery to repair a weakened artery, his son says.
   The 77-year-old actor got out of bed Monday and walked without
assistance for the first time since the operation Oct. 21, said Roy
``Dusty'' Rogers Jr.
   ``His oxygen hose only went 15 feet and he said, `This is
boring, going out only as far as your hose will take you,' '' the
younger Rogers said.
   Rogers starred in 87 Westerns, 35 with his wife, Dale Evans.
   He was hospitalized at St. Mary Desert Valley Hospital after
complaining of stomach pain. He underwent surgery to correct an
aneurysm, or weak spot, in his aorta, the body's main artery.
   Since Rogers was hospitalized, more than 400 well-wishers have
called the Roy Rogers-Dale Evens Museum in Victorville and 1,000
have sent cards and letters, Dusty Rogers said.

   States should have a ``national education
index'' to measure student achievement and pinpoint failing schools
or ineffective local leaders, a top educator says.
   With a benchmark to measure education progress, states would
have license to place failing schools on probation, remove
principals or school boards or even close ineffective schools,
Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said Monday.
   ``Local school control is crucial, but it's insufficient. In the
end, students must be served, and if a school, for whatever reason,
does not provide an effective education, state officials have both
a legal and moral obligation to intervene,'' Boyer told a Fortune
magazine seminar of about 300 businessmen, government leaders and
educators.
   As an extension of the education index idea, William ``Jerry''
Hume, head of American Foods Inc. of San Francisco, suggested
creating an employability skills scale for potential employees.
   ``This matrix would define the job applicant's academic skill
level on a one-to-five scale for reading, computation, writing,
problem-solving and critical reasoning and scientific reasoning,''
Hme said.
   Such a scale would define the individual's skill level on a
basic, intermediate and advanced level for organizational
effectiveness and leadership, social and teamwork skills,
motivation and self-development, listening and oral communication
and learning skills, he said.
   ``As a businessman, I would like to have standards for the
United States which define educational outcomes for this country
that are superior to outcomes attained by students in countries
with which we compete,'' said Hume.
   ``As a businessman I would like to have a student transcript
that shows a student's accomplishments vs. national standards.''
   Boyer insisted the nation is ``more than ready for a national
policy in education. ... After years of vigorously defending local
school control, the nation is now supporting - indeed almost
demanding - national leadership in education, while still
maintaining vitality at the local level.
   ``It's time to go beyond goals - important as they are - and
begin to talk more precisely about education standards and how
progress toward national objectives can be measured.''
   State must have clearly defined goals, an assessment procedure
requiring annual progress reports from schools, and clearly defined
methods of intervention in case a school is failing, Boyer said.
   Besides accountability and intervention, the foundation
president said, the index also should include:
   -School completion rates of students in every state. This
category would include a look at each student's proficiency in
English and mathematics, performance on general knowledge tests and
whether a state gives priority to writing.
   -The condition of teaching. States would be judged on whether
they have a plan for attracting outstanding students into teaching,
special strategies to attract teachers in math and science and
requirements for training that include sabbaticals, fellowships and
teacher institutes. Teacher salaries also would be considered.
   -The schools' climate as it relates to the quality of buildings,
classrooms and laboratories, as well as class size.
   -Financial support of schools. States' per-student expenditures
and other costs would be compared regionally so that cost-of-living
can be considered. Equity in school finance would be a key
consideration.
   -How schools are governed. States must have clearly defined
goals, as well as intervention methods in case of a failing school.

   Thousands of homeless and hungry Americans
are getting their daily meals from restaurants and caterers instead
of trash cans.
   At least 40 cities across the nation have launched programs to
put leftovers to use, according to Share Our Strength, a Washington
group that is waging a campaign to fight food waste.
   Prepared food left at the end of the day at deli counters,
banquets, restaurants and executive dining rooms is picked up and
distributed to shelters and soup kitchens.
   ``What's the point of throwing away all this wonderful food when
you could feed it to hunger relief agencies in your city?'' asked
Jennifer Hadley, coordinator of the campaign. ``These people are
hungry. And it's better to get food served from a catering company
than to pick it out of a trash can.
   ``The beauty of it is our country is concentrating a lot on
environmental issues and recycling, and this applies to food as
well.''
   The programs must adhere to strict health guidelines. No table
scraps are allowed, nor foods that are good candidates for
contamination, such as mayonnaise- or seafood-based salads.
   ``If I couldn't take it out of my refrigerator at home and feed
it to my granddaughter, I'm not going to give it to somebody
else,'' said Jo Anna L. DeBolt, who runs the Richmond program that
was modeled on programs in Norfolk and Atlanta.
   ``And if I'm not sure the agency is going to serve it in a
timely manner or have it refrigerated correctly or frozen
correctly, then I'm not going to be able to give it to them.''
   Caterers and some of the larger hotels with convention center
business had so much in leftovers that they were embarrassed, said
Rob Johnson, project director of the Atlanta Community Food Bank
program.
   ``We have about 150 donors of food that include restaurants,
caterers, hotels, corporate cafeterias, schools and hospitals,''
said Johnson, whose Atlanta's Table was launched in 1987. ``We are
now averaging about 30,000 pounds of food each month.''
   During its first month of operation in September, the Central
Virginia Food Bank distributed more than 7,000 pounds of food, or
about 7,000 meals, to nine organizations through Virginia's Table.
   Most of that came from the deli counters at 20 Richmond-area
grocery stores, Ms. DeBolt said. Cooked chicken breasts, rolls of
salami, bologna, fettucine and crepes have been donated, she said.
   For restaurateurs and caterers afraid of being sued if someone
gets sick, Ms. Hadley said all 50 states have adopted good
Samaritan laws that offer varying degrees of protection to those
who donate food in good faith.
   ``Not once in the 10 years since the laws have been implemented
has there been one suit. It has a great track record,'' she said.
   While Virginia's Table picks up and delivers donated food, the
D.C. Central Kitchen in Washington goes a step further. People are
trained in the art of cooking. They prepare meals from leftover
food.
   ``Instead of being a crutch, it ends up being a bridge for them
from one part of the community into another one,'' Ms. DeBolt said.

<HEAD>Panel Criticizes Decision to Allow Dugan to Retire at Higher Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate is begrudgingly allowing Gen.
Michael Dugan, relieved as Air Force chief of staff for his public
comments on the Persian Gulf, to delay his retirement until Jan. 1
and boost his pension by more than $17,000 a year.
   Over the weekend, the Senate Armed Services Committee and the
full Senate approved President Bush's nomination of Dugan to retire
in the grade of full general.
   However, in a report accompanying the panel's recommendation and
released Monday, the committee questioned the extraordinary
treatment of Dugan.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney fired Dugan, 53, as the Air
Force's top officer on Sept. 17 after Dugan told reporters about
contingency plans to unleash massive air raids on Iraq and target
Saddam Hussein personally.
   Under current law, Dugan would have been demoted two pay grades
to major general 90 days after his firing and would have been
retired on Dec. 17 with benefits based on the lower rank. However,
Bush nominated him to retire at four-star rank on Jan. 1.
   ``The primary reason for allowing Gen. Dugan to retire on Jan.
1, 1991, is to permit him to take advantage of the increase in the
basic pay for the grade of general upon which his retired pay would
be calculated,'' the committee said.
   A four-star general's basic annual pay goes from $78,199 to
$97,814 on Jan. 1, and retirement as a full general on that day
will mean an increase in Dugan's pension of $17,625 over what he
would have received in retirement in 1990 as a major general.
   Earlier, when Dugan's firing was announced, Pentagon officials
estimated his pension at $60,000 in the four-star rank, if he
retired then.
   Although the committee acknowledged Dugan's 32 years of
distinguished services, it strongly disagreed with Cheney's
decision to keep Dugan on active duty beyond the 90 days.
   Dugan remains at the Pentagon as a special assistant to Air
Force Secretary Donald Rice. He is overseeing studies on the future
needs for pilots and navigators as well as the officer evaluation
system.
   ``The committee is concerned not only about the circumvention of
the generous 90-day transition period, but the effect that such a
favored decision for one senior officer could have on the
perception of all other military personnel of the fairness and
integrity of the personnel system,'' the Senate panel said.
   Some other generals are being retired before Jan. 1, and are not
eligible for the higher retired pay, the committee said.

<HEAD>Americans May Still be Held in Southeast Asia, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congessional staff report conducted for Sen.
Jesse Helms questions the government's long-held contention that no
Americans who fought in the Vietnam war are still being held
captive in Southeast Asia.
   The interim report, released Monday, contends that the Pentagon
adopted its position about missing Americans and then discredited
evidence to the contrary.
   Information ``uncovered during this inquiry provides enough
corroboration to cast doubt upon the veracity of the U.S.
government's conclusion,'' said the report by the Republican staff
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The government has contended there is no evidence that American
prisoners are still alive in Southeast Asia - or that any were left
behind alive after U.S. prisoners returned in 1973.
   But the staff said, ``Classified, declassified and unclassified
information all confirm one startling fact: That the Defense
Department in April 1974 concluded beyond a doubt that several
hundred living American POWs remained in captivity in Southeast
Asia.''
   The information also does not rule out the likelihood that
Americans are still being held, the report said.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Ken Satterfield, said the
department had not received the new report and had no comment.
   The report said defense intelligence discredited - often in
error - live-sighting reports about U.S. personnel from hundreds of
thousands of refugees fleeing Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos during the
1970s and 1980s.
   It also contended that some witnesses may have been intimidated
and that information was dismissed on technicalities.
   Since the fall of Saigon in 1975, the Defense Intelligence
Agency has received nearly 12,000 reports on missing Americans,
most of them from Indochinese refugees. None has panned out thus
far, the Pentagon has said.
   The report disagrees with the findings of a House select
committee, which concluded a year after the war ended that there
were no POWs being held. However, that panel said a small number of
deserters or civilians might have voluntarily stayed behind.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., ranking GOP member on the Foreign
Relations Committee and a critic of the improving relations between
the United States and Vietnam, asked the panel's minority staff to
conduct the study.
   The government considers 2,103 personnel missing since U.S.
forces withdrew from Southeast Asia nearly 20 years ago. More than
55,000 Americans died in the war.
   The number of military personnel missing in action could be
higher because the Defense Department's files on various covert
actions during the war have not been opened and those who took part
were never identified, the report said.
   The release of the report comes nearly two weeks after Vietnam
promised to increase cooperation with the United States on an
accounting of American servicemen still missing.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, who met with
President Bush's special envoy for the MIA issue, said both sides
agreed to accelerate their efforts to locate missing Americans.
   In a letter accompanying the report, Helms said Thach's visit
was inappropriate at a time when the administration was unwilling
to address the issue of living Americans being held captive in
Southeast Asia.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Does Martinez Ad on Eve of Debate With Chiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First Lady Barbara Bush took to the
airwaves in support of GOP Gov. Bob Martinez, who is in a
neck-and-neck race with Democrat Lawton Chiles.
   In a new Martinez television ad, Mrs. Bush says she cares about
the race because she has family in the Sunshine State. Son Jeb Bush
of Miami is the governor's campaign chairman and the president's
mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, is a wintertime resident of Hobe
Sound.
   ``I can't vote for Bob Martinez, but I wish I could - and I hope
you will,'' says Mrs. Bush, a snapshot of President Bush visible on
a shelf behind her.
   Mrs. Bush credited Martinez for his support of the 1989 law that
toughened sentences for anyone convicted of a drug crime within
1,000 feet of a public school. She also appears to allude to the
60-year-old Chiles' decision to leave the Senate in 1988 because of
burnout.
   ``He's (Martinez) got the strength and energy a governor needs
to fight crime and drugs,'' she says.
   Chiles shrugged off the first lady's ad.
   ``I think Barbara's a neat lady. I'd like her to be speaking for
me,'' Chiles said.

<HEAD>Woman Who Was Raped Criticizes Williams</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman blasted Republican gubernatorial
candidate Clayton Williams after being sexually assaulted by a man
who repeated Williams' joke about rape.
   Chris Ausland ``had quoted Clayton Williams during the attack,
telling me that if it was inevitable, I should just relax and enjoy
it,'' the 31-year-old woman said Monday of the March assault.
   Williams made the rape remark during a cattle roundup at his
ranch when he likened bad weather to rape. He later apologized for
the comment.
   Ausland, 34, was sentenced Monday in state district court to 50
years in prison in a plea bargain agreement on several charges.
   The woman, trembling as she spoke, talked with reporters on the
condition her identity not be revealed.
   ``Any candidate who jokes about rape shows a gross insensitivity
towards women and is not likely to take a stand in promoting
victims' rights,'' she said.
   ``Speaking from personal experience, rape is anything but a joke
and at no point Mr. Williams was I able to relax and enjoy it,''
she added.
   She said she did not blame Williams for the attack, but said ``I
just blame Clayton Williams for voicing the attitude that is
outdated and is wrong and is hurtful.''
   Gordon Hensley, a spokesman for the Williams campaign, said
Williams had apologized for the remark and that the Republican's
anti-crime proposals are stronger than those of his Democratic
opponent, Ann Richards.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, unveiling a harsh partisan
political attack a week before the election, says he will travel
the country telling voters to blame Democrats for the nation's
troubles.
   With the Republican Party stumbling toward Election Day and his
own public approval ratings in a nosedive, Bush on Monday launched
an all-out attack on Democrats in Congress.
   The Democrats, he said, were interested in only two things -
``taxing and spending.''
   In a speech heavily geared toward repairing the damage the GOP
has suffered because of public discontent with the budget quagmire
and the weakening economy, Bush said he had to ``pay ransom'' to
the Democratic-run Congress in the form of higher taxes in order to
get spending cuts.
   ``We stopped them cold,'' from passing even higher taxes, he
claimed.
   Trying out his new speech at an Oklahoma City fund-raiser for
gubernatorial candidate Bill Price, Bush called for election of
more Republicans.
   The president suffered many defections by House and Senate
Republicans who voted against his position in the recent budget
battle and criticized him for abandoning his ``no new taxes''
pledge.
   ``The problem is this Democratic Congress that protects its
perks and privileges and turns its back on the American dream,''
Bush said.
   He was to make a similar address today in Washington to a
partisan crowd gathered by the Republican National Committee, and
take a cross-country political swing later in the week.
   The president blamed the Democrats for everything from being
soft on crime to playing ``class warfare'' with the budget
negotiations, to passing ``feel-good proclamations'' instead of
addressing real problems.
   ``America doesn't need a liberal House of Lords. America needs a
responsible Congress. America needs a Republican Congress,'' he
said.
   The Democrats, who unsuccessfully tried to pass a stiff surtax
on millionaires, have seized on the budget turmoil to paint
Republicans as defenders of the rich.
   ``I'm used to that kind of demagoguery and so I'm out here now
on the campaign trail laying it to rest,'' Bush said. ``I've got to
get that in focus because they've been getting away with this
tax-the-rich, class warfare kind of garbage that they always
resurrect at election time.
   ``I'm taking that message all across this country. ... We are
for the working people of this country,'' he said.
   Continuing to try and distance himself from the tax-raising
portion of the new budget package that he has promised to sign,
Bush said:
   ``I cannot join the liberal Democrats in an orgy of
self-congratulation.
   ``I think people know that this Congress is controlled by the
taxers, by the liberal Democrats.''
   He said Republicans saved Americans from a Democratic plot to
raise taxes on working people in the guise of soaking the rich.
   In the budget negotiations, Bush ultimately agreed to raise the
tax rate on the highest income brackets to 31 percent, from 28
percent now. The package also diminishes the ability of high-income
taxpayers to take itemized deductions.
   Bush earlier Monday claimed to take no notice of public opinion
polls saying he has slid to a 48 percent approval rating.
   He said at the Oklahoma event that he had tried his best to work
with Congress and do the job people elected him to do.
   ``I've tried very hard, only to have a parade of liberal
Democrats march to the microphone in the House of Representatives
to blame me for their failure,'' he contended.
   In a homestretch effort to swing votes for Republicans, Bush
leaves Thursday for Massachusetts, Florida and Ohio.
   He then travels to Minnesota, Iowa, California and Texas before
returning to Washington on Tuesday, Election Day.

<HEAD>Immigration Bill a Boon to Irish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prospects of legal citizenship for
thousands of illegal Irish immigrants are about to improve.
   Immigration reform legislation awaiting President Bush's
signature will provide thousands of extra residency visas to
Ireland. An estimated 100,000 Irish immigrants live illegally in
the United States, and tens of thousands more are hoping to leave
their economically strapped country.
   ``It's just a fact of life that a lot of young and skilled
people are going to leave Ireland anyway,'' Sean Minihane, a
lobbyist for the Irish Immigration Reform Movement, said Monday.
``Why not, from the standpoint of the U.S., shouldn't they be
allowed to come in?''
   The visas would be available to those living in Ireland or
illegal aliens living in the United States.
   The change in U.S. policy toward Irish immigration is contained
in the first comprehensive immigration reform bill in 25 years. The
bill, passed by Congress this weekend, would substantially boost
the number of immigrants allowed into the United States each year,
especially those with job skills.
   Bush supports the legislation. White House spokeswoman Alixe
Glen said the bill could be signed into law as early as this week.
   For the Irish, the bill could provide more than 80,000 permanent
residency visas by the turn of the century. That's roughly double
the number of Irish visas granted throughout the 1980s.
   Existing immigration law has cut off the supply of visas granted
to Ireland at well below the actual demand. The current formulas
favor visa applicants who have recent-immigrant relatives already
living in the United States - countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam
and Mexico.
   Irish illegal aliens are concentrated in the Boston and New York
metropolitan areas. Other pockets of Irish residents include
Chicago, Hartford, Conn., Philadelphia and San Francisco.
   Irish advocates celebrating passage of the immigration bill told
of the hardships brought on by illegal status: immigrants unable
attend a family funeral in Ireland for fear they would be forced to
stay; skilled professionals forced to tend bar because they could
not enter the job market; tenants unable to challenge a rent
increase because the landlord threatened to turn them in.
   In Ireland, the education system is turning out skilled
graduates to an economy with 17 percent unemployment.
   ``By most economic forecasts, we will be stuck with the problem
of emigration until the next decade,'' said an Irish embassy
official who asked not to be identified. ``We are providing new
jobs but not at a fast enough rate.'' The official said the Irish
government is ``delighted'' with the bill.
   For the next three years, Ireland would be the only country with
a guaranteed number of visas - 16,000 per year for a total of
48,000.
   Starting in 1995, up to 7,700 Irish would receive visas annually
under a ``diversity'' provision of the bill designed to offset the
unfairness of past immigration formulas. In addition, Irish could
apply under the traditional categories of family ties and
employment. The maximum allowable total for any country is 20,000.
   Those numbers compare to the roughly 3,000 to 5,000 Irish visas
issued per year in the early 1980s. For the past five years, the
number has averaged 5,000 to 7,500.

<HEAD>European Community Agrees On Carbon Dioxide Emissions Cap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a commitment to curb global warming, the
12-nation European Community has pledged to limit its output of
carbon dioxide emissions in the year 2000 to the 1990 level.
   The move Monday by EC ministers was seen as an attempt to
pressure the United States into a adopting a similar pledge at a
major international conference on the issue.
   Next week, negotiations open in Geneva on a convention aimed at
curbing the release of carbon dioxide and other man-made gases that
are causing a gradual increase in global temperature - with
potentially catastrophic environmental implications.
   Plans call for the drafting of a convention that would to be
ready for signing in 1992.
   The United States has yet to issue a proposal on how it plans
curb its carbon dioxide emissions - produced largely through the
burning of fossil fuels.
   ``A divided European Community would have been an excuse for the
Americans not to proceed any further,'' said a European Community
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Scientists believe that if nothing is done to curb them,
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases could
boost global temperatures 5.4 degrees by the end of the next
century, the fastest rise in 10,000 years.
   They call the phenomenon the greenhouse effect, and say that if
unchecked it could cause sea levels to rise and deserts to spread.
   About 500 scientists convened in Geneva on Monday for a 10-day
U.N. conference on global warming.
   A conference-ending meeting of about 80 ministers is expected to
draw several heads of government, including British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and French Premier Michel Rocard.
   The United States has sent a lower-level delegation.
   The EC's position to maintain its overall output of carbon
dioxide at 1990 levels in 2000 matches a pledge by Japan.
   In the European Community, these emissions come largely from
coal-fired power plants and traffic and grow at a rate of between 2
percent and 4 percent a year, officials said. The 1990 level is
almost 3 billion tons.
   The EC executive commission will work out quotas for each member
nations by the end of this year. The community's richest members,
such as Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Germany, France and
Denmark, will have to compensate for those members less able to do
so, officials said.
   The latter include Britain, which has a disproportionately large
number of coal-fired power plants, and the community's poorer
southern nations.
   The EC states agreed on a general commitment to save energy,
promote public transportation and encourage use of alternative
energy sources.
   Opening the Geneva conference on Monday, the top U.N.
environmental official, Mostafa K. Tolba, urged industrial nations
to take immediate steps to curb global warming.
   Tolba said a complete change in attitudes and living habits is
needed to avert a danger ``potentially more catastrophic than any
other threat in human history.''
   He said that only drastic reductions in emissions of
``greenhouse gases'' will stop warming of the planet.

<HEAD>Small Operator Companies Due for New Regulations To Stem Abuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal law going into effect next month
clamps new controls on companies that sometimes charge telephone
users at airports, hotels and other public places two or three
times what they normally pay for long-distance calls.
   As of Nov. 17, the so-called alternative operator service
companies will be required to clearly identify themselves during
calls, provide rates and billing procedures on demand, stop
charging for unanswered calls and allow some access to the
interstate long-distance company that callers wish to use.
   The Federal Communications Commission, which already had
instituted many of these rules but had found widespread lack of
compliance, also will be required to begin monitoring the rates
these companies charge. If the commission finds the rates unjust,
it could order them rolled back.
   The FCC also is empowered to establish rates for the entire
industry in about two years.
   The operator service companies handle ``dial-O'' calls, such as
collect, person-to-person and charge card calls made by the
traveling public.
   These companies contract with the owners of phones at hotels,
universities, airports, hospitals and other public places to handle
their long-distance service and then lease lines on carriers such
as AT&amp;T, MCI and US Sprint.
   Callers often are unaware when they dial a phone away from home
that they're using one of the operator companies. Many callers have
complained of excessive charges and billings from cities they've
never visited.
   The FCC says it receives more complaints about operator services
companies than any other telephone issue - about 150 a month.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says his talks
with a Soviet envoy were useful, but that the results will not
necessarily become known publicly.
   In an interview with Cable News Network correspondents in
Baghdad aired Monday night, Saddam also reiterated his
determination to maintain control of Kuwait.
   ``Meetings are always useful,'' Saddam said of his discussions
with Yevgeny M. Primakov, Middle East adviser to Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Primakov has been reported as saying his discussions with Saddam
produced little movement, but Gorbachev has said there were signs
of flexibility on Saddam's part.
   Saddam called his discussions with Primakov ``wide-ranging and
very useful,'' but said the first statements would have to come
from Primakov.
   ``Not everything that was agreed will come out in the open,''
Saddam said.
   As he has in the past, Saddam said his troops have no intention
of leaving Kuwait, which they occupied on Aug. 2. And any fighting,
he said, would be the result of what he called aggression by the
United States, Britain or Israel.
   Saddam also insisted again that the Arab nations' problems be
resolved as a whole, not piecemeal, and linked resolution of the
Palestinian issue to the Kuwait crisis.
   The Iraqi leader said he hoped war would not break out and ``if
the Americans were to opt away from war, then they will establish a
strong position for itself and humanity.''
   But he said Iraq and Iran were ``the only armies with wide
experience in fighting wars'' in the Persian Gulf region.
   Saddam appeared relaxed and smiled on occasion during the CNN
interview. He wore a civilian coat and tie. At one point he was
asked if he would enjoy fishing with President Bush, a sport both
men are fond of.
   ``I have no objection to looking into this proposition,'' Saddam
said. But he said he would like a meeting with Bush only if it
meant a substantive discussion.

   A popular toy known as the ``slap-wrist''

paper covering the thin metal may tear over time, exposing the user
to a sharp metal edge.
   The panel said parents should alert children to the potential
danger and should examine the toys frequently.

<HEAD>FDA Moves To Ban Ingredients In Diet Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration wants to ban
the use of 111 ingredients in non-prescription diet drug products,
including one it says presents a safety hazard.
   That ingredient is guar gum, which is extracted from plant
matter. Three months ago, FDA told the distributor of one brand of
diet tablet, Cal Ban 3000, that contains guar gum to stop
distributing the tablets because it had received 17 reports of
users suffering from obstruction of the esophagus.
   Aside from those tablets, the agency did not give brand names of
products affected.
   The action does not affect guar gum use in small amounts in
foods where it poses no health hazard, foods such as cheese, salad
dressings and ice cream, the agency said.
   The agency said the 111 ingredients had not been proven
effective in diet products. The ban includes alcohol, corn syrup,
dextrose, kelp, pineapple enzymes, rice polishings, saccharin,
salt, sodium bicarbonate, vitamin C and wheat germ.
   FDA said it had given manufacturers opportunities to prove the
ingredients were effective but that it had received no significant
information.
   The proposed ban is being published in today's Federal Register
along with another proposed ruling tht calls for a warning on
general over-the-counter drugs containing water soluble gums like
guar gum.
   Products containing such substances, including guar gum,
psyllium, and the like, would have to carry labels warning users to
take them with adequate fluid and to avoid them if the user had
ever had difficulty swallowing.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Drops Non-Obscenity Pledge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts has
quietly dropped a controversial requirement that grant recipients
sign a non-obscenity pledge, now that Congress has voted to scrap
explicit restrictions on the kinds of art eligible for federal
subsidies.
   The pledge, instituted by endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer
late last year, has spawned three federal lawsuits charging that it
violated the Constitution's free-speech guarantees.
   At last count, 16 artists and arts institutions refused to sign
the pledge and forfeited more than $318,000 in endowment grants
last year.
   The endowment made no formal announcement of Monday's action,
but agency officials confirmed that the pledge had been withdrawn
and would not be required as a condition of receiving grants for
the 1991 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
   Shortly before it adjourned last weekend, Congress junked the
obscenity ban it imposed on the arts endowment a year ago and voted
instead to leave judgments of obscenity to the courts.
   The proposed new law awaiting President Bush's signature would
require the endowment to recoup its grant money from any recipient
who is later convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   The bill omits any explicit obscenity restrictions, saying only
that obscenity lacks artistic merit, is not protected speech under
the Constitution and ``shall not be funded'' by the endowment.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises, Nikkei Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the yen in active
trading today, while the weaker yen and higher oil prices helped
push down share prices.
   The dollar closed at 129.00 yen, up 1.65 yen from Monday's close
of 127.35 yen. It opened at 128.95 yen and ranged between 128.80
yen and 129.80 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed at
25,242.40, down 86.91 points, or 0.34 percent, from Monday's finish
of 25,329.31. The key index gained 323.67 points Monday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million shares,
down from Monday's 500 million shares. Dealers said the yen's
decline and higher oil prices discouraged investors interest.
   North Sea Brent crude oil for December delivery was valued at
$34.85 to $34.95 a barrel at 4 p.m., about 85 cents above late
Monday levels in New York.
   In bond trading, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds were quoted at 84.84 points at 5 p.m., down from
84.94 points late Monday. Their yield rose to 7.735 percent from
7.710 percent.
   The dollar's advance followed a rally in New York, where it
closed at 128.65 yen Monday, up from 128.25 yen on Friday.
   Dealers said trading was active. Spot transactions totaled
$14.842 billion, well up from Monday's $4.371 billion and also
above last Friday's $10.605 billion.
   ``The dollar is changing hands in a range, and it is near the
top of the range today,'' said Minori Takeuchi, a trader with
Chemical Bank.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the U.S. Federal Reserve's reduction in the
federal funds rate from 8 percent to 7.75 percent Monday did not
affect the Tokyo market much.
   ``We had been anticipating an easing since mid-August, when the
move surfaced,'' she said.
   Besides, she said, it was seen as a less aggressive move than
expected to ease monetary policy in the United States.
   Lower interest rates usually tend to push down the dollar
because they diminish the value of dollar-denominated securities.
   When the dollar surged to the upper 129-yen level in afternoon
trading, Japanese institutional investors began converting dollars
to yen, taking profits on the dollar's rise, dealers said.
   But purchases by oil companies paying dollars for petroleum
helped the U.S. currency, they said.

<TEXT>
   The eighth game of the world chess championship
was adjourned until tonight with experts saying a series of
seemingly bad moves by titleholder Garry Kasparov had given Anatoly
Karpov the edge.
   Play resumes at 5:30 p.m., when Kasparov's 41st move is to be
unsealed.
   The players are tied 3{-3{ in points. A player gets one point
for a victory, a half point for a tie. The first player to reach
12{ points wins the championship. Each player has won one game; the
other games ended in draws.
   Kasparov appeared to have the advantage most of the time Monday,
but experts said he left Karpov in a better position by the time
the game was adjourned.
   ``Everyone was shocked and staring in complete amazement,''
international master Alex Fishbein said of the turnaround. ``Karpov
was brilliant in defense, extraordinary. His tactics were very
strong in time pressure and his nerves were very good. This is a
devastating blow to Kasparov.''
   Others said Kasparov could still salvage a draw.
   Karpov was under severe time pressure. After 27 moves, he had
only five minutes left for his next 13 moves, while Kasparov had 33
minutes to go. Each player is allotted 2{ hours to make his first
40 moves.
   ``It's unbelievable how bad Kasparov played in the time scramble
and how well Karpov played,'' said grandmaster Michael Wilder. ``At
one point, it looked as though he (Kasparov) was making completely
random moves.''
   The first 12 games are being played in New York and the
remainder will be played in Lyon, France.
   The winner will get $1.7 million, the loser $1.3 million.

   There are big tippers - and then there
are those who leave $25,000, even though they might not know it.
   Just ask Keith Thomlinson, a bartender at the Greenhouse Inn and
Restaurant in Middletown. He found an instant lottery ticket among
his tips last week. When he scratched off the numbers, he had won
$25,000.
   ``It sat there for almost two days until I scrubbed it off,''
Thomlinson, 42, said Monday. ``I was just shocked.''
   The ticket came from Russell Clark of Newport, a regular at the
Greenhouse who often leaves an instant lottery ticket with a dollar
or two as a tip at area restaurants and bars. He said he often
leaves candy or flowers, too.
   ``It's just something I do,'' he said.
   Thomlinson gave $1,800 to Clark and $5,000 to his mother and
father.
   ``She's going to pay bills,'' Thomlinson said. ``Dad's retired.
They don't have a real big pension.''
   Clark, 60, a lab technician in Newport, said he probably would
use his $1,800 to buy more lottery tickets for his friends in the
restaurants.
   He has an informal agreement with the waiters and bartenders
that if they win more than $600, he gets a cut. Clark said that in
the 10 years he had been handing out tickets, a waitress once won
$500.

   Despite their distaste for Arne Carlson,
members of Minnesota's conservative Republican Party say they may
have no choice but to back him as their replacement nominee for
governor this close to the election.
   Carlson, the state auditor, is considered too liberal by some
Republicans to replace Jon Grunseth, who dropped out Sunday after
being accused of philandering and swimming nude with teen-age
girls. Grunseth denied the allegations.
   Carlson, a Republican who favors abortion rights, had jumped
into the race last week as a write-in candidate as pressure mounted
on Grunseth to step down.
   Carlson said he is confident party leaders will conclude that he
should be on the ballot to face Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich on
Nov. 6.
   The party's 14-member executive committee meets tonight to
discuss whether it even has the authority to name a successor to
Grunseth.
   Today's Star Tribune reported eight members of the executive
committee said they either will support Carlson or are leaning that
way.
   Others said having Carlson as the party's choice is inevitable.
   ``I think we do have to be realistic and realize that it's too
late to force another candidate on the ballot,'' said Evie Axdahl,
a committee member. ``I feel that's the only choice at this point
and I think that's unfortunate.''
   Secretary of State Joan Growe said if the party does not reach a
decision, the law calls for the runner-up in the primary - Carlson
- to go on the ballot.
   State GOP Chairwoman Barb Sykora said she has concluded that
``the only sensible option is the option that looks like we are
legally bound to - support Arne Carlson to the best of our ability
and beat Rudy Perpich.''
   Growe, the state's chief election office, said Republicans have
until 5 p.m. Friday to get a new candidate on the ballot.
   But she urged GOP leaders to decide as quickly as possible to
allow more time to print an estimated 2 million ballots.
   Another complication involved Grunseth's running mate, who did
not file papers withdrawing from the race for lieutenant governor.
   ``As far as we're concerned, she is the Republican candidate for
lieutenant governor,'' said Elam Baer, executive director of the
Grunseth campaign.
   But Growe said her office has concluded Clark no longer is a
candidate because of Grunseth's withdrawal.
   ``Since state law requires you to be a team, there no longer is
a team,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   William French Smith, who as Ronald Reagan's
personal lawyer helped guide him to the White House and then worked
to carry out the Reagan Revolution as the president's first
attorney general, has died at 73.
   Smith, who died of cancer Monday, helped lead the
administration's conservative shift on such issues as civil rights
and corporate mergers.
   ``William French Smith served his country with the greatest
dedication and distinction,'' Reagan said in a statement. ``As
attorney general, he brought talent, wisdom, and the highest
integrity to the Department of Justice.
   ``Nancy and I are deeply saddened today,'' Reagan said. ``We
have lost a dear friend, who we will always remember with the
greatest respect and affection.''
   Born in Wilton, N.H., to an aristocratic Yankee family, Smith
pursued a career in corporate law, leaving New England behind for
Los Angeles.
   A Navy officer during World War II, Smith later became Reagan's
personal attorney, helping guide investments that made the former
actor a millionaire.
   Smith served as informal chairman of Reagan's so-called kitchen
cabinet, a group of California millionaires who saw Reagan socially
and helped his quest for the governorship, and finally, the
presidency in 1980.
   Others in the group included Justin Dart, Walter Annenberg,
Verne Orr, William Clark, Alfred Bloomingdale and Holmes Tuttle.
   A specialist in corporate labor relations, Smith was managing
partner of the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher when Reagan
named him the nation's 74th attorney general in 1981. Smith served
until 1985 and was succeeded by Edwin Meese III.
   Among the policy changes in which he played a key role were the
appointment of the first woman to the Supreme Court, Sandra Day
O'Connor; legislation overturning a 100-year-old ban on military
aid to civilian law enforcement; relaxation of rules against
corporate mergers, which had not been changed in 15 years, and
halting the Justice Department's advocacy of mandatory busing to
desegregate schools and of hiring and promotion goals to remedy job
discrimination.
   His relaxation of antitrust enforcement infuriated consumers and
liberal Democrats.
   Black groups and women's organizations were outraged by his
civil rights policies. They prevailed in Congress over hisopposition to
toughening the Voting Rights Act and in court over
his unprecedented effort to give tax exemptions to racially
discriminatory private schools.
   Smith's personal finances and patrician style also drew attacks.
   Career department attorneys jeered his establishment of a second
private dining room at the Justice Department and his regular
appearances on the Washington social circuit.
   In 1982, Democrats, including Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, criticized his investment in two oil and gas tax
shelters and his acceptance of a $50,000 severance payment when he
left the board of the Earle M. Jorgensen Steel Co. to become
attorney general.
   Smith agreed to return the $50,000 and limit his tax deductions
in the two ventures.
   Smith is survived by his wife, Jean; three sons; a daughter; a
stepson; a stepdaughter, and seven grandchildren.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Fail To Repair Broken Hatch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet cosmonauts, working in open space for
nearly four hours, failed today in an attempt to repair a
malfunctioning hatch aboard the Mir space station, the official
Tass news agency said.
   Cosmonauts Gennady Manakov and Gennady Strekalov, who have been
in space for nearly three months, left the spacecraft at 45 minutes
past midnight to work on the door, which failed to close properly
during a spacewalk in July.
   ``They did not manage to correct the hatch malfunction,'' Tass
said.
   The malfunctioning hatch is on Kvant-2, a module containing
photographic and technical equipment attached to the Mir space
station.
   During a spacewalk in July, Mir's previous tenants, Anatoly
Solovyov and Alexander Balandin, apparently were unable to close
the hatch after they entered the airlock, and had to enter the
spacecraft through another port, officials said at the time.
   They were reported by Soviet to have come dangerously close to
running out of oxygen.
   Tass said that today's malfunction presented no danger to
Manakov and Strekalov.
   ``This was just ordinary maintainance work in space, not some
extraordinary situation,'' Tass quoted Mission Control specialists
as saying.
   Today's spacewalk had originally been scheduled for Oct. 19, but
was postponed after Strekalov caught a cold while working out on an
on-board running track.
   The Soviet Union's manned space program, which for decades has
been a source of national pride, has been plagued in the past two
years by docking equipment failures, mistakes by cosmonauts and
budget cuts.

   A Soviet inspector, testing artillery aboard a
navy submarine chaser, forgot to check if the weapons were loaded
and accidentally fired off 17 shells in the direction of
Vladivostok, Tass said today.
   ``Several artillery shots boomed in Golden Horn Gulf, the very
center of Vladivostok,'' the official Soviet news agency said in a
report from the Far Eastern port city on the Sea of Japan.
   ``Seventeen shells were fired from the large submarine chaser
Admiral Vinogradov.''
   Tass said Monday's accident occurred after V. Kolganov from the
local armaments factory began checking a firing circuit without
checking first to see if the weapon was armed.
   ``The triggering mechanism worked faultlessy,'' Tass reported,
and 17 shells were fired. The news agency did not further describe
the weapon or the ammunition.
   ``The city was saved from serious damage by the angle of the gun
barrels, which were almost vertical,'' Tass said. The report did
not say if there were any injuries or if any action would be taken
against Kolganov.

   The dollar was firmer at higher levels in calm
European trading today, after a long-awaited move by the U.S.
Federal Reserve to ease interest rates.
   Traders said the one-quarter percentage point easing in the
Federal Funds rate was a relief to the market.
   ``The dollar is still in a downtrend, but it is retracing its
steps,'' one trader in Milan said.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   David Deitch, senior dealer at Nomura Bank International in
London, said the dollar's rise was triggered by a combination of
factors. Increasing tension in the Persian Gulf helped the dollar
as did hints by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that third
quarter gross national product (GNP) data to be released today will
show faster than expected growth.
   But, Deitch added, underlying economic concerns haven't faded
and the market will continue to take any rallies by the dollar as
just another opportunity to sell.
   ``There has been some temporary demand for the dollar but it is
much less likely that the dollar will hold these levels for long,''
he said.
   Market attention was likely to focus on the release of the new
GNP data. Brady hinted that it could be as high as 2.4 percent
rather than the expected 1 percent.
   But dealers warned that if the number proves closer to market
forecasts, the dollar could fall heavily.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.00 yen, up 1.65 yen from
Monday's finish. Later in London, it was quoted at 129.20 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   -1.5205 German marks, up from 1.5170
   -1.2890 Swiss francs, up from 1.2865
   -5.0907 French francs, up from 5.0775
   -1.7135 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7090
   -1,139.50 Italian lire, up from 1,136.75
   -1.1640 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9513, compared
with $1.9525 late Monday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$373.35 per ounce at midmorning, up from $372.75 bid per ounce late
Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $373.50, up from $372.50 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $3.49 an ounce today, to close at
$374.65.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.14 a troy ounce, up
from Monday's $4.10.

<HEAD>Li Says Planning Meeting Will Precede Party Session</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chinese Premier Li Peng has announced a special
national conference to plan economic strategy, newspapers said
today in another sign top Communist officials are unable to reach
agreement among themselves.
   The official China Daily quoted Li as saying a long-awaited
meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee will be held
only after the national planning conference. He said both meetings
will be held before year's end.
   The 195-member Central Committee, which sets policy, was to have
met shortly after the Asian Games ended in Beijing on Oct. 7 to
approve the economy's next Five-Year Plan. The current plan ends in
December.
   Foreign diplomats say the meeting has not convened because
divisions are so great that no draft plan is sure of winning
approval.
   Conservatives are said to be pressing for continued strong
central controls, while opponents argue that the economy is healthy
enough to resume a market-oriented reform program put on hold two
years ago.
   The debate goes deeper than economic issues because the
participants' stances reflect conflicting ideological convictions
and visions of how China will enter the 21st century.
   For example, the leading figure among the central planners,
85-year-old Chen Yun, regards reform as an effort to improve
efficiency with the economy remaining largely state-owned and
directed.
   Many younger economists, however, say state ownership is the
problem and that reforms should lead to privatization.
   The lower-level planning conference may be an attempt to work
out a compromise. Li said only that it would plan next year's
economic program.
   The China Daily quoted him as saying that ``quite a lot of time
for preparation and discussion'' is needed before the Central
Committee meeting can be held. He predicted that no major changes
would be made in China's development program not just during the
next five years, but the entire decade.
   The newspaper said Li made the comments Monday when meeting with
a group of foreign ambassadors. He may have been seeking to dispel
the impression that the leadership has been paralyzed over the
issue.
   Li did not say who would attend the conference, but the session
was likely to include provincial and major city leaders as well as
central government officials. A similar meeting was held in
September but mainly highlighted differences of opinion without
reaching any solutions, according to foreign diplomats who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In a separate report, the China Daily quoted a senior official
from the People's Construction Bank of China as saying the
2-year-old policy of strictly controlling loans will continue next
year, ruling out a return to fast growth.
   Some of the strongest pressure to resume free market reforms
comes from provincial authorities. During the mid-1980s under Li's
predecessor, Premier Zhao Ziyang, provinces were given substantial
power to retain profits from local industries and approve imports,
exports and loans.
   The central government lost revenue but remained responsible for
major infrastructure investment and price subsidies, resulting in
annual state deficits. Shortly after becoming premier in 1988, Li
began a strict austerity program that has cut state spending and
partially reined in the provinces.
   Reforms have been under an ideological cloud since June 1989,
when the conservatives crushed a massive popular movement for
democratic change.
   Nonetheless, debate recently has resumed on steps such as
privatizing housing, selling stock in state companies and reducing
state price subsidies.
   Vice Premier Tian Jiyun announced Saturday that grain prices
will be adjusted over the next five years to reduce subsidies. The
state buys grain from farmers and sells it to urban residents at a
loss.

   Mayor Tony Senecal, looking to cut
down on the number of beggars in town, wants to charge panhandlers
$25 every six months.
   ``There's nothing that says there can't be a licensing fee
charged for panhandling,'' Seneca said.
   His ordinance would apply to all individuals and organizations
that set up collection efforts in the downtown area, the mayor
said.
   The proposal goes before City Council on Thursday.
   Bob O'Brien, spokesman for the West Virginia chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, doesn't like the idea.
   ``It's a way of making life difficult for people whose life
already is difficult,'' he said.
   The ordinance also would require panhandlers to pay business,
occupation and state sales taxes. Violators would be fined $500 and
face up to 10 days in jail.
   ``How are they going to pay a tax if they're already
panhandling?'' O'Brien said.

   At least 1 ton of frozen catfish filets that
spilled into a downtown park from an overturned truck will be used
by a food bank to feed the hungry, officials said.
   The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, which provides food
for 310 non-profit charities, said Monday that the owner of the
cargo allowed the food bank to use the fish Department of
Agriculture officials considered salvageable.
   ``It's a blessing,'' said the organization's executive director,
Joyce Rothermel, who estimated the food's value at $4,000 to
$5,000. ``Donations that are high in protein, like fish, are very
rare.''
   The truck carrying cargo of the Delta Pride Catfish Co., of
Indianola, Miss., slammed into a wall on the side of an overpass
Sunday as it left a downtown tunnel. The truck's trailer toppled
into the park below, crushing two trees and littering the grass
with fish.

<HEAD>Alaska Car Wash Owner Wants City to Pay Rent for Boulder Dumped on
His Land</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOMER, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owner of a car wash says a 35-ton
boulder sitting on his property is bad for business and wants the
city to pay more than $3,000 in rent for the space the unwanted
rock takes up.
   The city put the boulder on the car wash site during street
improvements, Pioneer Carwash owner Malcolm MacIntosh said. The
rock was there when he bought the business.
   MacIntosh said he began asking the city to get rid of the rock
soon after he took over the business about two years ago. He
offered it as a gift for use as a landscaping ornament in a park,
but the city didn't budge on the offer.
   ``All I ever wanted them to do is move it so I can use the
land,'' MacIntosh said. ``It's costing me money because if I have a
car here washing and a car here vacuuming, no one can get around.''
   His lawsuit in Small Claims Court seeks two years' rent at $120
a month plus interest for payments he says are overdue, for a total
of $3,085.22.
   City Manager C.E. Swackhammer said he is researching MacIntosh's
claim but hasn't found any documents on the rock in city files. He
said he also is trying to find past owners of the car wash.
   MacIntosh said he began billing the city for back rent in June.
He said he arrived at the amount by comparing rates at local
storage yards for an item of that size. He added a bit for the
inconvenience to his business.

Southwest.
   A storm system moving in off the Pacific Ocean brought rain to
Seattle and Spokane, Wash., and strong wind to the state and
Oregon.
   Sunny skies were expected along the Eastern Seaboard, with
temperatures in the 50s in Maine, the 60s and 70s in the
mid-Atlantic states and the 80s in Florida.
   Highs in the 80s were likely in the South and Midwest, and
temperatures were expected to reach the 90s in the desert
Southwest.
   The high for the nation Monday was 97 degrees at Borrego
Springs, Calif., and Parker, Ariz.

<HEAD>Arkansas Candidate Sues Foe for Libel Over Campaign Mudslinging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Republican candidate for Arkansas
attorney general says all campaign mudslinging isn't protected by
the Constitution.
   Asa Hutchinson of Fort Smith filed a defamation lawsuit against
his Democratic rival, Lt. Gov. Winston Bryant, on Monday, claiming
some television ads and public statements misrepresent the facts.
   The ads claim Hutchinson received illegal campaign contributions
in a failed 1986 run for the U.S. Senate, Hutchinson's lawsuit
said. It also said Bryant accused Hutchinson of engaging in
criminal conduct during a speech.
   Bryant of Malvern scoffed at the suit, calling it a desperate
move by a floundering campaign.
   ``This is really nothing more than a last-ditch desperate
attempt by my opponent,'' Bryant said. ``He's falling in the polls.
His campaign is falling apart.''
   Bryant said his public statements and campaign advertisements
are supported by documentation.
   ``Although this lawsuit is unusual in a political campaign, the
attack ads of Mr. Bryant go beyond routine campaign rhetoric,''
Hutchinson said. ``This lawsuit is important to reverse the trend
toward mudslinging campaigns that are based upon distortion and
outright lies.''
   The suit seeking unspecified damages claims that Bryant's
television advertisements used deliberate or reckless falsehoods as
a political tool. According to the suit, Bryant approved the ads
with knowledge of or reckless disregard for the alleged false
statements.
   The ads accuse Hutchinson of accepting illegal campaign
contributions from the National Republican Senatorial Committee
during his unsuccessful 1986 campaign, the suit said.
   Hutchinson said the suit is bolstered by a 1989 U.S. Supreme
Court decision in a libel trial filed by an Ohio judicial candidate
against a newspaper. In the case, Harte-Hanks Inc. vs. Connaughton,
the high court upheld a $200,000 award against the newspaper,
ruling that ``speech used for political ends does not automatically
bring it under the protection mantle of the Constitution.''

   The city imposed a curfew and organized patrols
by residents toting fire extinguishers, while free cable TV was
offered to keep firebugs home tonight during Devil's Night,
Detroit's pre-Halloween arson spree.
   The measures are part of an effort by Detroit to remake its
lawless image and end the annual outbreak of fires that has become
a national embarrassment.
   Devil's Night is actually three nights of vandalism, beginning
two nights before Halloween and peaking one night before.
   Mayor Coleman A. Young last week unveiled a ``My Heart is with
Detroit'' campaign, urging residents to take pride in their city
and step up anti-arson patrols.
   More than 35,000 residents and city workers have volunteered to
keep an eye out for arsonists, Young said. Rewards of up to $1,500
have been offered for information leading to the conviction of
arsonists.
   Volunteers wearing red-and-white ``My Heart is with Detroit''
T-shirts and caps began walking the streets Monday night, some
carrying fire extinguishers to put out small blazes.
   Until the 1970s, Devil's Night featured typical Halloween tricks
such as egg tossing, covering homes and yards with toilet paper and
burning piles of leaves.
   Then came larger fires, set in garages, trash bins or abandoned
homes, bringing flames that sometimes spread to occupied houses.
   The worst Devil's Night came in 1984, when 810 fires were set
during the three-day period. Last year, there were 223 fires
between Oct. 29 and Oct. 31, 115 of them on the night before
Halloween.
   The annual rampage has left families homeless and gutted dozens
of buildings, bringing bad publicity for Detroit.
   Rowena Williams, 64, a retired Chrysler Corp. worker who posted
a ``My Heart is with Detroit'' sign in her front yard, said she
dreads the Halloween season.
   ``I don't even put on the lights. You're too scared,'' Williams
said as she stood behind security bars at her front door. ``I don't
open my door for trick-or-treaters. I wish I could, but it's too
dangerous.''
   The Southeast Michigan Cable Association this year decided to
unscramble TV signals, including movie services such as HBO and
Showtime, in hopes of keeping arsonists indoors.
   As in the past two years, Young imposed a 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m.
curfew for people 18 and under from Monday through Thursday. Police
arrested 379 curfew violators last year. By early today, more than
113 had been arrested, police said.
   ``It's really going to be up to the discretion of the officer,''
police spokesman Officer Thomas Martinelli said. ``If a kid is
stopped on his bike about a mile away from home and he is going
away from his house he could be arrested.''
   Ze'ev Chafets, a 43-year-old writer born in Pontiac who moved to
Israel at age 20, is in town to drum up sales for his book
``Devil's Night and Other True Tales of Detroit.''
   In the book, which has been blasted by Young and other
officials, Chafets refers to Detroit as ``America's first Third
World city.''
   Chafets says in the book he met people on Devil's Night who make
annual trips to the city just to watch it burn. He wrote that in a
restaurant on the 70th floor of the Renaissance Center,
``suburbanite patrons were cheering the fires as they dined
alongside revolving glass walls.''
   The mayor said Chafets' expose doesn't help solve the problem.
   ``We're attempting to come up with a more positive image for the
city,'' he said. ``It's obvious that Devil's Night has a bad
connotation. It always has. Then some guy writes a book about it
and it becomes worse.''
   The arson trend has begun to spill over into the suburbs.
   A curfew was imposed in Highland Park after a few buildings were
burned in recent years. ``We're working with two shifts over the
next three days to cut down on any problems,'' police Lt. Ron
Behrend said Monday night.
   In Flint, where about 140 fires were reported last year, the
Fire Department began last week lecturing at schools and to
neighborhood clubs.

cancer. He was 73.
   ``William French Smith served his country with the greatest

attorney general, he brought talent, wisdom, and the highest
integrity to the Department of Justice.''
   Born in Wilton, N.H., to an aristocratic Yankee family, Smith
served as informal chairman of Reagan's so-called kitchen cabinet,
a group of millionaires who helped his quest for the governorship
and later the presidency.
   Smith was appointed the nation's 74th attorney general in 1981
and served until 1985.
   Smith is survived by his wife, Jean; three sons; a daughter; a
stepson; a stepdaughter; and seven grandchildren.

<HEAD>Moldavian Parliament Expels Christian Turkish Deputies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Moldavian parliament has expelled 10 Christian
Turkish deputies for urging the secession of the Gagauz people from
the republic and organizing elections, Tass said today.
   The move came as nationalist and secessionist forces were
reported to be pulling back from a confrontation and more talks
were planned on resolving their ethnic conflict.
   Tension in southern Moldavia, a republic bordering Romania, has
dissipated since two regiments of Soviet Interior Ministry troops
began arriving over the weekend to establish a buffer between
Moldavians and the Gagauz minority, the official news agency Tass
and the independent agency Interfax reported Monday.
   Tass said today that the Moldavian parliament expelled 10 of 13
Gagauz deputies because they ``shunned parliamentary sessions,
ignored parliamentary laws and resolutions, provoked citizens to
violate Moldavian laws and organized general elections in the
Gagauz republic.''
   The Gagauz, descendants of Christians who fled religious
persecution in Turkey about 160 years ago, claimed the southern
corner of the republic last week and began holding elections for an
autonomous government within Moldavia.
   Numbering about 150,000 in the republic of 4.3 million, the
Gagauz said they feared rising Moldavian nationalism and were angry
over a law making Moldavian the republic's official language.
   Tass said the declaration of independence, declared
unconstitutional by the Moldavian parliament, had heightened ethnic
tensions in the republic.
   A state of emergency was declared in the region Friday, and
Soviet troops were sent to keep the peace. ``The situation ... has
improved slightly during the past 24 hours. Previously the
situation was characterized as explosive,'' Tass said Monday night.
   The ethnic unrest was the latest to strike the Soviet Union and
could further complicate President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's hopes to
hold the country together with a new union treaty.
   Interior Ministry troops also have been deployed in several
other republics to prevent ethnic violence.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein today
summoned senior military aides and told them the United States and
its allies might attack in ``the coming few days,'' the official
Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Saddam and the joint command of the armed forces met to complete
preparations for ``urban warfare'' in occupied Kuwait, the report
said.
   The agency, which was monitored in Nicosia, did not explain why
Saddam believed an attack was imminent.
   But Middle East diplomats said Saddam was reacting to statements
Monday by Secretary of State James Baker III, who said that ``there
is a limit to the international community's patience.''
   ``Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a possible use of force
if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait,'' Baker said in a speech in Los
Angeles.
   The diplomats spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   The meeting in Baghdad came one day after the U.N. Security
Council's five permanent members held a high-level military meeting
to discuss how to further pressure Saddam into quitting the emirate
he invaded on Aug. 2.
   The Security Council voted on Monday to hold Iraq liable for
damages from the Iraqi invasion and occupation.
   The Iraqi News Agency dispatch said the meeting of the military
command in Baghdad was the second in 24 hours to be chaired
personally by Saddam.
   It said he led the session to ``discuss preparations for urban
warfare and necessary measures to be taken in the event of combat
in the operation zone of the Kuwait province.''
   After the invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait,
Baghdad's official media took to referring to the oil-rich emirate
as Iraq's 19th province.
   The Iraqi News Agency said today's meeting was attended by all
members of the joint command of the armed forces. Saddam is the
supreme commander, and there are at least eight top generals and
three Cabinet members: the ministers of defense, information and
military industries.
   ``We must be prepared with all that God has given us of
potential to thwart perfidious intentions by the United States and
its allies to launch an attack in the coming few days,'' Saddam
told the military command.
   The agency did not give other details, but said officers on duty
in Kuwait were brought to Baghdad to attend the session.
   With 220,000 servicemen deployed to operation Desert Shield, the
United States is by far the largest contributor to the force facing
Saddam's army in the gulf. Other countries have together committed
about 100,000 troops to the operation. The multinational force
faces more than 400,000 Iraqi troops.

<HEAD>Father, Mother Plead Guilty to Nine Years of Raping Three
Daughters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A husband who raped three of his daughters
repeatedly over nine years has pleaded guilty to rape and child
abuse. His wife, who brought the girls to him, also pleaded guilty
in the case.
   The rapes caused 10 pregnancies, each of which ended in
abortions.
   Monday's pleas by the couple, both age 43, were part of a
bargain with prosecutors to avoid a trial in Baltimore Circuit
Court on 30 counts of various sex and child abuse offenses.
   The father admitted to three counts of first-degree rape and
three counts of sexual child abuse. He agreed to three consecutive
life sentences and must serve the first 30 years. He will be
sentenced Dec. 7.
   The mother, who had described the family as ``very close
and...very religious,'' admitted to three counts of first-degree
rape and three counts of sexual child abuse. She will be sentenced
Dec. 6, but agreed Monday to a 25-year sentence, 15 years of which
must be served.
   Under Maryland law, a person who helps someone else commit a
felony can be charged as if he or she committed the crime.
   The names of the parents were withheld to protect the identity
of the victims, who are now living with relatives.
   The two eldest of the three daughters, now 17, 20 and 23, are
daughters of the woman from a previous marriage. The youngest is
the child of both defendants. One of the daughters is now a medical
student, the others still live in Baltimore.
   The abuse that began in 1981 remained undiscovered until last
March, when one of the daughters wrote at the bottom of a history
test: ``I hate life. I hate school. I hate people. I hope to die.
Soon....!!!''
   Police were notified by social services workers and two days
later, on March 22, the father confessed.
   According to court documents, the father told the police that he
first started fondling his stepdaughters when they were 5 or 6, and
began having sexual intercourse with them and with his daughter as
they reached the age of 10 or 12.
   Assistant State's Attorney Wanda Robinson said Monday the mother
brought the girls to their father, then was present when some of
the rapes occurred, either pretending to be asleep or facing the
wall while her daughters screamed and fought.
   The mother had not wanted her husband's assaults to become
public, nor to be left alone to raise her seven children, five
girls and two boys, Robinson said.
   There were no allegations that the father abused the other
children.
   In a letter to the court, the mother wrote: ``I'm sorry for not
being there when my daughters needed me.''

<HEAD>Military Government Says Top Dissident Has No Political Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's state press has said there is
no political future for leading dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, whom
the military government has detained without trial for more than a
year.
   In a two-part article Oct. 22-23, The Working People's Daily
also indicated the government would release Ms. Suu Kyi only if she
accepted exile. A copy of the article was obtained in Bangkok
today.
   The articles were the clearest statement yet of the government's
intentions toward Ms. Suu Kyi, whose National League For Democracy
won the May general election by a landslide but has been blocked
from taking office.
   ``Aung San Suu Kyi has no right according to the law to take
part in the political activities of (Burma),'' the article said.
   Ms. Suu Kyi was put under house arrest in July 1989 and later
barred from the election. She was accused of subversion, but never
formally charged.
   The decision to disqualify her from the election ``puts an end
to her political career once and for all,'' the paper said.
   The daily also reprinted without comment a report from a Thai
newspaper last month, in which a Japanese diplomat quoted the head
of Burma's government, Gen. Saw Maung, as saying he would free Ms.
Suu Kyi if she accepted exile.
   A political source in Burma's capital, Rangoon, said the state
press had stepped up attacks on Ms. Suu Kyi after authorities
cracked down on dissident Buddhist monks last week and arrested at
least a dozen senior officials of the National League For
Democracy.
   ``It's an all-out attempt to discredit (the National League) and
Aung San Suu Kyi,'' said the source, who was contacted by telephone
from Bangkok and spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A recent cartoon in the Working People's Daily said Ms. Suu Kyi
had defiled the Burmese race by marrying a foreigner, the source
said.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, the 45-year-old daughter of Aung San, Burma's
revered independence leader, is married to British academic Michael
Aris.
   The source said the government appeared to have succeeded in
squelching dissent among the monks. Buddhist monks stopped
ministering to soldiers last month to protest military violence
against demonstrators. The authorities responded with stern
warnings, raids on monasteries and arrests.
   The source also said the government was trying to force leaders
of opposition parties to sign a document saying they agreed to
follow a program requiring that a new constitution be approved
before the government steps down.
   The National League For Democracy had ignored the plan when it
was announced in July. Instead, it demanded the government convene
the Parliament chosen in the May election and negotiate a transfer
of power.
   A Burmese source in Rangoon said Cho Cho Kyaw Naing, leader of
one political party, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, had
refused to sign the agreement.
   Both Rangoon sources dismissed news reports that Myint Myint
Khin, a central executive committee member of the National League
For Democracy, had signed the document.

   A bridge collapsed into the San Juan
River today, plunging at least 10 vehicles into the water and
killing two people, police said.
   Officers said a loaded concrete carrier and several other
vehicles were crossing the bridge linking Manila and the city of
Mandaluyong when part of the span's eastbound lane fell at about
11:20 a.m.
   At least 20 people were pulled from the polluted water. Others
swam to shore.
   Taxi driver Danny Iskuriel said the bridge fell so slowly he was
unaware it had collapsed until he water began seeping into his car.
   ``We realized we were already in the water,'' he said. ``We went
down in slow motion.''
   Iskuriel said he saw one of his passengers escape but did not
know what happened to the other.
   Crisostomo Jopson said he was in a car on the bridge when it
buckled and collapsed. ``When we collapsed, we floated,'' he told a
radio station. ``I got out of the car and swam.''
   Another survivor, Tomasa Villegas, said she was seated beside
the driver in a crowded passenger jeep when the bridge fell. ``I
saw other passengers swimming,'' she said.
   There was no explanation for the collapse, but neighborhood
residents said the bridge was cracked during an earthquake in July
that killed more than 1,600 people. The crack was never repaired,
residents said.
   President Corazon Aquino's government has been criticized in
Congress and the media for allowing the nation's roads, bridges and
public buildings to deteriorate. The government says it lacks the
money for such projects.

   A French human rights group said
today vote rigging defeated Benazir Bhutto's populist party in last
week's elections.
   The International Federation of Human Rights is the first group
of poll watchers to echo Ms. Bhutto's charges of fraud in voting
for national and provincial legislatures.
   The Islamic Democratic Alliance, which will form Pakistan's next
government, called the group's assessment ridiculous.
   ``They must have had super vision like the the comic book
character Superman to be able to see massive fraud which dozens of
other observers could not see,'' said an alliance spokesman who
insisted on anonymity.
   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party was handed a stunning
defeat in Wednesday's national parliamentary elections. In
provincial legislative polling three days later, her party won
support only in her home province of Sindh.
   In a statement issued by the French Embassy in Islamabad, the
four-member human rights team said there was a discrepancy between
the widespread impression of sparse voter turnout and the official
report.
   The statement also cited problems with what it said were delayed
polling results and the absence of official vote tallies.
   Almost without exception, international and local witnesses
reported sparse voter turnout, but officials said 45.6 percent of
the electorate cast ballots Wednesday, nearly 3 percent more than
in November 1988.
   The Paris-based human rights organization, which has members in
54 countries, charged that Ms. Bhutto's opponents altered the
election results, suggesting the intervention could have occurred
between the polling stations and the election return offices.
   Ms. Bhutto said vote rigging was widespread in 100 of Pakistan's
217 constituencies. She claimed between 2 million and 4 million
pre-prepared ballots were stuffed into boxes en route from polling
stations to election return offices.
   Chief Election Commission Justice Naeemuddin dismissed the
charges, saying: ``I have not received a single complaint.''
   But the French report claimed several polling agents were not
given certified results following the vote count at the polling
station. Instead they have only slips of papers to prove their
count.
   ``Something very important - no official paper with the results
was given to polling agents when the voting was over,'' the group's
statement said.
   The human rights group's report was at odds with that of the
Washington-based National Democratic Institute, which said polling
was ``generally open, orderly and well-administered.'' The
institute sent 40 observers to Pakistan.
   A 15-member team from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh
also concluded the voting was fair, as did a three-member Canadian
team.
   Ms. Bhutto, 37, was sacked as prime minister Aug. 6 by President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who charged her party indulged in corruption,
nepotism and confrontational politics during her 20 months in
power.

<TEXT>
   Troops opened fire today on Hindu
fundamentalists who broke through police lines and surged toward a
holy site claimed by both Hindus and Moslems. At least five people
were killed and 20 wounded.
   Thirteen more people died in Hindu-Moslem clashes in several
cities hundreds of miles away, police said. At least 125 people
have been killed in riots across India this past week, most in
clashes between Hindus and Moslems.
   The dispute threatens to topple the government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh, who opposes the Hindu campaign to replace a
16th-century Moslem mosque.
   Militant members of the country's Hindu majority had said they
would begin tearing down the mosque today and replacing it with a
temple.
   Singh today repeated his offer to resign if members of his party
in Parliament ``feel that change of leadership will serve larger
goals.'' He made a similar offer Monday.
   About 200 Hindus eventually reached the site today in Ayodhya.
Those who got through planted Hindu religious flags on the mosque
in victory before police drove them away.
   About 10,000 people who had surged past police barricades
surrounded the perimeter of the disputed site when three Hindu holy
men urged them to halt the violence, saying they had negotiated a
peaceful sttlement with local officials. But part of the crowd
apparently did not hear the appeal and pushed toward the mosque,
setting fire to six police jeeps along the way.
   Police then opened fire. The federal government later announced
that five people were killed. About 20 others were injured by the
gunfire, witnesses said.
   Hindu holy men screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted the
police with stones. At least four officers were injured.
   Many of the militant Hindus were beaten back by police, who
fired tear gas and lashed out with iron-tipped bamboo canes. Dozens
were injured.
   The crowd initially halted about 100 yards from the mosque,
where police and paramilitary troops stood with rifles ready. But
later about 200 Hindus broke through police lines and reached the
small, one-story mosque.
   Young men wearing orange headbands, the color of the Hindu
faith, climbed atop the mosque and chipped concrete from each of
its three domes, claiming this was a ``symbolic destruction'' of
the Islamic shrine.
   They planted a saffron flag atop each dome before police drove
them away. Jubilant crowds poured through the streets, shouting
``Victory to mother India!''
   In New Delhi, the government's chief spokesman, Ramamohan Rao,
said there was no damage to the mosque.
   The World Hindu Council, which is leading the temple program,
said it would go ahead with its construction effort.
   ``We will only rest when the temple in complete,'' Girilal
Kishore, a Hindu holy man and senior official of the council told
reporters in New Delhi.
   Ayodha, a city of 40,000 people, had been under a
round-the-clock curfew since Friday and roads leading to the mosque
were blocked as authorities tried to halt any attempt to tear down
the mosque.
   But people emerged from hiding places in fields around Ayodhya
before sunrise and stormed a bridge leading into the town.
   About 20,000 police and paramilitary troops were deployed in and
around Ayodhya, 300 miles southeast of New Delhi. They were among
200,000 security troops on alert throughout Uttar Pradesh state.
   About 80,000 people have been arrested in the last week in the
rural state. Most were made under preventive detention laws that
allow authorities to hold people without charge when they believe
public safety is threatened.
   The detainees included top leaders of the right-wing Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party. It has withdrawn its support for Prime
Minister Singh in Parliament, plunging India into political crisis.
   Singh now does not have a reliable vote bank in Parliament to
preserve his minority government, which took office last December.
   The mosque at issue was built on the place that many Hindu
leaders claim is the very spot where the god Rama was born.
   Moslems, who make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people,
fear that if one mosque is moved or destroyed, hundreds of other
Islamic shrines across India would be in peril.
   Athough India is constitutionally a secular nation, Hindus
comprise 82 percent of the population and have always held the
prime minister's post.

   Bush administration officials - believing
sanctions will not force Iraq to pull out of Kuwait - plan to
discuss a timetable with U.S. allies for a possible military
offensive, it was reported today.
   In his visits to Europe, Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations,
Secretary of State James Baker III will assess the impact of the
U.N.-backed embargo and consider additional steps, including the
use of force, the Los Angeles Times said.
   President Bush, asked about the report at the White House today,
told reporters, ``I could, but I'm not going to comment.''
   The newspaper says a senior government official who is involved
in Persian Gulf strategy considers war almost inevitable. The
official, whose name was not disclosed, is quoted as saying: ``I
know of no one who disagrees with my assessment of the situation
and what we have to do to achieve our goals.''
   The official said the most likely time for an offensive would be
in December or January, ``although it could come earlier or a
little later,'' the newspaper reported.
   In an address to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council on
Monday, Baker reaffirmed that the United States strongly prefers a
peaceful solution consistent with the mandate of U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
   ``We are exhausting every diplomatic avenue to achieve such a
solution without further bloodshed,'' he said.
   However, he added: ``Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a
possible use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait.''
   He said Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein must realize ``there is a
limit to the international community's patience.'' The Times quotes
another U.S. official as saying it is the United States that cannot
wait indefinitely.
   ``He can sit there indefinitely and he knows how to absorb
pain,'' the official said of Saddam. ``But we can't sit there
forever. We've got to make some hard decisions about how to resolve
it, and those decisions may come sooner rather than later.''
   Baker travels to Saudi Arabia and the other countries starting
on Friday.

   A security agent shot to death a Palestinian
who stabbed an Israeli guard in the West Bank, and an Arab died in
a failed bombing near Tel Aviv. Both deaths came in apparent
revenge attacks for the Temple Mount killings.
   A third attack occurred in Arab east Jerusalem, where a
Palestinian stabbed a policeman. The victim suffered superficial
neck wounds, and the assailant was arrested, police and Israel army
radio said.
   The attacks were the latest in violence set off by the police
response to the Oct. 8 riots on the sacred Temple Mount. Twenty
Palestinians were killed by police who opened fire on Arabs who had
pelted Jewish worshipers with rocks.
   Since then, five people have been killed and 11 wounded in a
series of revenge attacks by Arabs and Israelis.
   In the occupied West Bank today, a Palestinian stabbed a private
Israeli security guard who was escorting a gasoline truck into
Nablus, the army said.
   Army radio said the guard was stabbed three times in the back as
he stood on the street. A plainclothes Israeli security officer who
was passing shot the attacker to death, it said. The guard suffered
moderate wounds.
   The army imposed a curfew on Nablus and the surrounding refugee
camps, confining some 130,000 Palestinians to their homes.
   Three masked Palestinians announced through a loudspeaker that
the slain assailant, identified as 18-year-old Haitham Jamla, was a
member of Islamic Jihad, a Moslem fundamentalist group outlawed by
Israel on Monday.
   The decision to ban the group apparently came after it claimed
responsibility for the stabbing deaths of three Israelis in
Jerusalem last week. Israel has blamed Islamic Jihad for dozens of
earlier attacks on Jews.
   In the Tel Aviv suburb of Bnei Brak, meanwhile, a bomb exploded
in a vegetable store, killing one Arab and wounding two as they
tried to assemble the device, police said.
   Chaim Selzer, a medic who arrived first at the scene, told army
radio that one of the wounded lost a hand in the explosion. A third
Arab suffered minor injuries, officials said. Both were taken to a
nearby hospital.
   The radio said the three Arabs were employed at the store in the
ultra-Orthodox suburb and slept there at night, indicating that
they were from the occupied territories.
   Israeli law bars Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip
from staying in Israel overnight. Many Israeli employers sidestep
the law, however, and provide primitive accommodations for
Palestinian laborers so they don't have to make the long journey
home to the West Bank or Gaza every night.
   After last week's revenge attacks, Defense Minister Moshe Arens
closed off the occupied lands for four days, barring Palestinians
from entering Israel.
   On Monday, he announced tougher restrictions to permanently ban
Palestinians from entering Israel, saying he would block all those
with records of crime or activities in the 34-month-old Palestinian
uprising.
   The daily Haaretz said today that about 20,000 would be banned,
up from 8,000 now. Among those banned will be Palestinians held
under emergency regulations that allow them to be jailed for up to
a year without charges.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Monday night that Israel
would crack down hard on Arabs attacking Jews.
   ``We shall react to them whether they use stones or firebombs,
knives or other weapons,'' he told American Jewish fund-raisers.
``We shall not expose our citizens to danger. We shall build a wall
of steel and love around our people, as we face threats.''
   In other violence today, masked assailants shot and killed
45-year-old Khalil Hassan Najar in the Gaza Strip refugee camp of
Rafah on suspicion he collaborated with Israel, Palestinian
reporters said.
   The army said police were investigating.
   The death brought to 292 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in the uprising, most on suspicion of helping Israel.
   The death in Nablus brought to 767 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis. Fifty-one Israelis have also died in the
violence.

   Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, locked in a
tough re-election contest, sparred with hecklers at a rally,
pushing one protester away from a microphone and grabbing pamphlets
from his hand.
   Helms invited one protester, Marty Leary, to his microphone
Monday to speak for a minute, and Leary questioned the senator's
votes on the deregulation of savings and loans.
   But when time was up, the senator moved Leary out of the way.
   ``Go to the Gantt rallies if you want to waste your time, but
don't be rude,'' the senator said, pushing Leary away from the
microphone. Helms faces Democrat Harvey Gantt in his bid for a
fourth term.
   Leary, 25, of Durham, said Helms' push wasn't very forceful.
   ``I think he gave me a little reminder nudge that my time was
up,'' Leary told radio station WRDU. ``It didn't seem like too
unfriendly a push.''
   About 100 supporters and a dozen hecklers had met Helms as he
kicked off the final week of campaigning.
   When Leary and other protesters shouted, ``But why did you vote
for it?'' Helms invited Leary to come to the microphone and ask his
questions.
   ``Four times you voted for the savings and loan bailout or to
deregulate the financial industry,'' Leary said, asking Helms to
explain his votes.
   ``I'd say this to anybody who voted for it,'' Leary said,
drawing hoots from the crowd.
   ``No you wouldn't,'' Helms responded. He drew a roar from
supporters as he pushed Leary away, saying, ``Your minute is up.''
   ``I would ask the Gantt supporters to go back to their candidate
and tell him to try to tell the truth once in a while,'' Helms
said.

   A grave containing more than 100
bodies, most believed to be those of murdered teen-agers, has been
found on the outskirts of Rio, a church worker said today.
   Eduardo Gomes, who works for the Roman Catholic Church, said
police discovered the grave Saturday in the city of Nova Iguacu.
   ``There appear to be about 100 bodies in the grave and most are
almost certainly teen-agers, killed by death squads,'' he said.
   The death squads, which are largely made up of police officers,
are normally paid by small shopkeepers to kill petty thieves. Many
victims are destitute minors.
   Gomes said only a few bodies had been retrieved from the grave
thus far. He said clothing and shoes found in the grave indicated
most of the corpses were those of youngsters.
   Initial attempts to confirm Gomes' report were unsuccessful. No
one answered the telephone at police headquarters in Nova Iguacu.
   In a report issued earlier this year, the London-based human
rights group Amnesty International said hundreds of children were
being murdered each year in Brazil.
   ``There is a marked presence of organized actions for the
elimination of children and adolescents with a view to `cleaning up
the streets,' '' the report said.

   President Omar Bongo's governing party
won a slim majority of parliament seats in Gabon's first multiparty
elections in 22 years.
   Official results released Monday after the fourth round of
voting in the central African nation gave the Gabon Democratic
Party 59 of 117 seats in which representatives have been chosen.
   Independents allied with Bongo's party won an additional three
seats.
   Six opposition parties took a total of 55 seats.
   Three seats remained to be filled in voting that was ordered
rescheduled because of alleged irregularities.
   The Woodcutters' Movement for National Redress won 19 seats and
the Gabon Progress Party 18 to lead the opposition parties.
   Sunday's balloting and the September voting that preceded them
were forced on Bongo by violent protests against one-party rule.
The president's seven-year term expires in 1993.
   The first two rounds of voting in September were marred by
allegations of widespread fraud, and opposition parties called on
the government to resign and cancel the results. But a compromise
was accepted in which voting for disputed seats was rescheduled for
Oct. 21 and Oct. 28.

   The neighbor, Gabriela Kantor called deputies, who arrested Rose
without incident.
   He was booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon.
Bail was set at $5,000, Hom said.
   Ms. Kantor, 37, was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for
observation, a nursing supervisor said.
   The Guns N' Roses band, based in Los Angeles, has been rebuked

<HEAD>China Releases Census Results: Population at 1.13 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   BEIJING (AP) - China today released preliminary figures from its
largest-ever census showing a population of 1.133 billion - 20
million more people than the government had planned.
   The census, conducted in July, marked the first time the
government had conducted door-to-door surveys. It is considered the
most accurate figure ever for China's population.
   The census found 1,133,682,501 people residing permanently in
mainland China, the nationally televised evening news and the
official Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The last reported population figure, in late 1989, showed 1.112
billion Chinese, but that figure was based on previous population
figures that Chinese officials have conceded were unreliable.
   An editorial to be published Wednesday on the front page of the
party newspaper, the People's Daily, called for greater attention
to population control.
   ``For China to reach its goal of a population of 1.25 billion by
the year 2000 ... is still very difficult. We must have a full
understanding of this,'' it said. The editorial was excerpted by
Xinhua and read on the newscast.
   The government had hoped to keep the population down to 1.113 by
the end of 1990, but the census showed that by mid-1990 the
population had exceeded the goal by 20 million.
   The growth rate for the July 1989-June 1990 period was 14.7 per
1,000, the census found. China's growth rate has been increasing
steadily since 1985, when it was 11.23 per 1,000.
   The birth rate also rose for the fourth straight year, to 20.98
per 1,000. In 1985, it was 17.8 per 1,000, the census showed.
   China's population increases by more than 30 people every
minute, or about 17 million people annually, according to official
reports.
   China has failed to stay within its population targets because
of a baby boom and the government's inability to maintain its
one-child-per-family policy, especially in the countryside. Under
the policy, instituted in 1980, families must pay steep fines
following the birth of a second child.
   In rural China, the idea that a large family means prosperity
remains strong and some farmers have become rich enough to pay
fines for having extra children to work on their properties.
   The one-child policy also has been relaxed for some families in
economic difficulty, including those with one daughter.
   Further complicating matters, people born during a baby boom in
the mid-1960s are now in their marriage and childbearing years,
causing a new peak in the population curve.
   The census, carried out over 10 days, involved 7 million people.
Final results will take two years to compile.

   Back home after a turbulent 101st Congress,
senators are in a political dilemma over whether to campaign as
government outsiders or legislative insiders.
   In North Carolina, Republican Sen. Jesse Helms faces a stiff
challenge from Democratic rival Harvey Gantt, who is telling voters
it's time for a change.
   The three-term senator was put on the defensive about his votes
in Congress as he kicked off his final week of campaigning on
Monday. The senator shoved a protester at a rally in Durham after
the man questioned Helms' votes on the savings and loan bailout.
   ``Go to the Gantt rallies if you want to waste your time, but
don't be rude,'' the senator said, pushing 25-year-old Marty Leary
away from a microphone.
   Leary said Helms' push wasn't very forceful.
   ``I think he gave me a little reminder nudge that my time was
up,'' Leary said. ``It didn't seem like too unfriendly a push.''
   Just two days earlier, Helms had been campaigning by
speaker-phone from his Washington office and criticizing the
legislation approved by Congress in the last-minute rush toward
adjournment.
   The Clean Air Act is ``just not fair to the taxpayers and to the
workers of America,'' Helms said, contending that the benefits
could occur at half the bill's $50 billion price.
   Helms' comments came as Gantt complained that Republican
administrations have damaged the government's image.
   ``I basically see the government has become a dirty word to so
many of us in recent years,'' Gantt said over the weekend.
   In Illinois on Monday, Democratic Sen. Paul Simon and Republican
challenger Rep. Lynn Martin boasted about major bills that cleared
Congress with benefits for their constituents.
   The budget rolls back higher U.S. Customs Service fees at
airports in Rockford and Waukegan, Ill., Martin said. The
transportation bill fully funds Amtrak routes in Illinois, Simon
said.
   ``The transportation pie has been getting relatively smaller,
but Illinois once again is a clear winner in the transportation
budget,'' the senator said during a campaign appearance Sunday
night.
   Simon holds a solid lead over Martin in recent polls.
   Forced to remain in Washington until just eight days before the
election, several candidates sought to create the impression that
they were hard at work ensuring that their state or district
benefited in Congress' rush to adjourn.
   Some lawmakers, however, believe the turmoil that surrounded the
drawn-out budget fight hurt their campaigns.
   Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz held a substantial lead over
Democratic challenger Paul Wellstone during the summer, but a
recent poll showed the race as a dead heat.
   Boschwitz rushed home in the middle of last week and
acknowledged, ``I think the turmoil in Washington is having an
effect on my campaign.''
   In Indiana, Republican Sen. Dan Coats sought to distance himself
from President Bush and the 101st Congress.
   ``I just think the president made a major mistake by thinking he
could play the good guy, play the compromiser and negotiate with
the Democrat Congress,'' Coats said Monday.
   Although his campaign filmed Bush's appearance and endorsement
earlier this year, it does not plan to use the footage. ``It's
going to make some good home movies,'' said Coats, who was
appointed to succeed Vice President Dan Quayle in the Senate.
   Coats said the deficit-reduction plan changes a government
course that led to peace and prosperity in the 1980s and he called
the 101st Congress ``a major disappointment.'' Coats maintains a
solid lead over Democratic challenger Baron Hill.
   In Oregon, where Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield is fighting for
his political life, Democratic challenger Harry Lonsdale has
accused his opponent of receiving more than $80,000 from special
interest groups in the past two days.
   ``I think Oregon voters would rather have an independent voice
like Harry Lonsdale,'' said the candidate's spokesman, Dan Walter.
   Hatfield, who returned home often during the last month of
Congress, focused on such local issues as timber industry jobs
while launching a campaign ad that questions his opponent's
competency.
   The campaign of Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry also has begun
airing negative ads that attack Republican James Rappaport's
wealthy real estate background.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Kerry sought to
portray Rappaport as a candidate of Reaganomics and a product of
the last decade of Republican administrations.

<HEAD>General Upset Over Protesters Against Military Buildup in Middle
East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force general is
accusing police of ``coddling'' protesters opposed to the U.S.
military buildup in the Middle East.
   Chicopee's mayor reminded the general that the protesters have
rights.
   Air Force Reserve Brig. Gen. Frederick D. Walker, commander of
the 439th Military Airlift Wing, fired off letters to Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis and Chicopee aldermen earlier this month calling
periodic protests at the base gates by several dozen people
``weekly outbursts of lawlessness.''
   He also accused police of trying to ``coddle and placate the
lawbreakers.'' He complained that in one instance a fuel truck was
delayed for 45 minutes while police ``pleaded with protesters to
`temporarily' stand aside.''
   Walker was in Georgia and could not immediately be reached for
comment today. But Gordon Newell, base public relations officer,
said the general was upset over what he considered a dangerous
situation.
   ``From the viewpoint of a military commander in a time of world
tensions, the refusal of the city of Chicopee to maintain clear
passage to this military installation in unacceptable,'' Walker
said in his Oct. 9 letter to the governor.
   Westover, the nation's largest Air Force Reserve base, is the
main staging area in the Northeast for cargo flights to Saudi
Arabia. The base is in Chicopee in western Massachusetts, near
Springfield.
   The general got little sympathy from Chicopee Mayor Joseph J.
Chessey Jr., who called Walker's conduct ``totally inappropriate
for a person holding his rank and position'' and accused him of
trying to muzzle dissent.
   ``I don't personally agree with the protesters, but they have
rights and in the general's mind those rights should be denied,''
Chessey said Monday. ``They have a right. This is America. This is
not Iraq.''
   The mayor fired off his own letter of complaint to Walker's
superior, Maj. Gen. Alan G. Sharp, asking that the Air Force
``bring sanity and resolution to this problem.''
   Chessey and acting Police Chief Joseph J. Wilk Jr. said police
have arrested protesters who blocked access to the base and refused
to move. Twenty-one protesters were arrested Oct. 20 at two base
gates and two others were arrested Aug. 27.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, ... there have been no dangerous
situations up there,'' Wilk said. ``And as far as I'm concerned,
it's been a minimal inconvenience.''

<HEAD>General Says Units Being Readied to Rotate to Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is preparing to rotate fresh combat
units to Saudi Arabia to relieve units that have been in the desert
since the start of Operation Desert Shield, a senior Army official
said today.
   Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army vice chief of staff, said,
however, that the Army had not yet been instructed to increase the
overall number of soldiers in Saudi Arabia beyond the more than
100,000 already there or en route.
   More than 210,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen are in the
Persian Gulf area, and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said Monday
that as many as 100,000 more could be sent.
   Sullivan said in an interview that the last pieces of the
originally planned Army deployment to Saudi Arabia will be ashore
``within the next couple of days.'' President Bush ordered troops
to the gulf to defend Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqi attack
five days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``They're essentially there,'' Sullivan said of the remaining
elements of the Army deployment, which is the largest operation
since the Vietnam War.
   The four-star general said no final decision have been made on a
rotation policy for Desert Shield, and he did not say when the
replacement units would be sent.
   Cheney has said he expects a six-month rotation, and Sullivan
said that while details won't be decided for a couple more weeks,
the Army already is making arrangements.
   ``Some headquarters do know'' they'll be sending replacement
units, Sullivan said. ``Now if you were to get down and ask the guy
down in the infantry squad someplace if he knows, the answer is
`no' he doesn't. They haven't been alerted.''
   Sullivan said troops from U.S. bases in Europe that are
scheduled to be closed are likely to be used as replacements in
Saudi Arabia.
   For the first time in a major U.S. military operation, the Army
will rotate whole units in Desert Shield instead of replacing
individual soldiers, Sullivan said. The switch in approach is
designed to prevent the kind of breakdown in cohesion of combat
units that was experienced in the Vietnam War, he said.

   A straight-A student under suspension
took seven hostages at gunpoint in a high school classroom, then
let them go and surrendered, leaving behind chalkboard graffiti
about death and suicide.
   Eli Dean, 17, was taken to a mental health center for evaluation
after the eight-hour standoff Monday at Charlestown High School. No
one was injured.
   No charges were immediately filed.
   Juvenile Court Judge Clementine Barthold today ordered Dean to
undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Clark County Prosecutor Steve
Stewart said he would review the test results and information from
police and witnesses before determining formal charges.
   In the meantime, Dean was being held on a preliminary juvenile
charge of committing a delinquent act, armed criminal confinement.
   The boy made no demands during the siege but threatened several
times to kill himself, police said.
   ``I think he just had a lot of personal problems that he wanted
brought out,'' said Sgt. John Mann, a hostage negotiator with the
State Police.
   Dean, a senior suspended twice recently for triggering a false
fire alarm and breaking a window, was carrying a .38-caliber pistol
and a bottle of whiskey, police said.
   The teen-ager had come to school Monday morning to get his
homework assignments, Vice Principal Susie Reis said. Reis told him
he was not supposed to be on school grounds.
   Dean instead took over the English class taught by Melody Money.
   He entered the classroom and began waving the gun. Students
thought he was playing a joke until he began knocking items off
desks and hollering, said Ruby Wray, a student.
   Jason Fultz, another student, said: ``We were scared stiff. Miss
Money kept pleading with him to let us go.''
   Dean freed most of the students, taking hostage six youngsters
and the teacher. Besides trashing the classroom, he scrawled
suicidal graffiti on the blackboard, witnesses said.
   Principal George Marshall said he went to the classroom during
the standoff and Dean told him, ``Just give me time and I will
release them.''
   Pupils at the 643-student school about 20 miles from Louisville,
Ky., were evacuated onto the football field.
   Dean was on probation for being a runaway and for illegal
alcohol consumption, said John Buford, his probation officer. He
was suspended most recently last week, for breaking a window, said
his stepfather, Rocky Williams.
   ``He was falling behind in his school work and was upset,''
Williams said.
   Dean was a straight-A student who also excelled at sports,
school officials said.
   Friends speculated about what brought about the standoff.
   ``Ninety-five percent of this school doesn't accept you if you
are your own person,'' classmate Richie Otersbach said. Dean was
``into heavy metal, had long hair for a while and was ridiculed for
that.''

   Police detained the nation's most
prominent labor leader today in connection with last week's
national strike after he appeared on a TV panel show with Manila's
police chief.
   Crispin Beltran, leader of the May First Movement, and police
Col. Ernesto Diokno were among the panelists who discussed
Wednesday's strike on TV station GMA's weekly show, ``Viewpoint.''
   Diokno said police had been looking for Beltran since the strike
because of allegations that he made seditious statements. Diokno
said he would ``invite'' Beltran to police headquarters.
   After the program, Beltran was led away to a police car and
driven to the Western Police District headquarters.
   Diokno said Beltran would be held overnight and that police
would charge him with inciting to sedition and illegal assembly.
   Last week's strike was the most extensive since President
Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986 during the ``people
power revolution'' that toppled the late President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   The strike, which was called to demand a 42 percent increase in
the daily minimum wage, paralyzed public transportation in Manila
and other cities.
   Militants believed to include Communist rebels burned 23 buses,
passenger jeeps and other vehicles during the labor unrest.
   Mrs. Aquino refused to grant the $1.50-a-day increase and
instead told union leaders to refer their demand to a
government-labor wage council.
   Later, the unions scaled down their demand to $1 a day, but Mrs.
Aquino refused that request too. She also promised to punish strike
leaders responsible for violence.

<HEAD>Ferries Work Around The Clock to Get Tourists Off Island</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WANCHESE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of cars waiting to get off
Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands decreased to 180 today as ferry
operators worked around the clock to rescue tourists stranded by a
bridge collapse last week.
   At least 300 vehicles queued up at the Ocracoke ferry slip
Monday. But today, only 50 cars were waiting to travel from
Ocracoke to the mainland and 130 were waiting for a shorter ferry
ride from Hatteras to Ocracoke.
   ``Our short-term goal is getting visitors off the island,'' Joe
Myers, director of the state Division of Emergency Management, said
at a Raleigh news conference Monday.
   Hundreds of tourists were trapped Friday when a dredge slammed
into the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, severing the only road linking
Hatteras and Ocracoke islands to the mainland.
   The accident also knocked out electrical power for the islands'
5,650 residents. Power was restored to most areas by Monday.
   Four ferries moving 150 cars every six hours are the only way
off the islands. Travelers must take one ferry for the mile trip to
Ocracoke, then another ferry 30 miles to the mainland. The complete
trip takes about 3{ hours.
   Meyers said the ferries were working 24 hours a day. Buffy
Warner, an owner of the Island Inn, a hotel within walking distance
of the Ocracoke ferry slip, said the group of tourist waiting to
leave had been calm.
   ``I think everybody's taking it pretty much in stride,'' Warner
said. ``This is a pretty good crowd of people to be stranded.''
   Getting one lane of the bridge open should take 45 to 90 days,
depending on the weather, said Bill Marley, highway administrator
with the North Carolina Department of Transportation.
   Replacing the span will cost at least $1 million, he said.
   Contractors should begin clearing the bridge debris from the
Oregon Inlet by Wednesday, he said.

<HEAD>Two Nuclear Reactors Shut Down Due to Breakdown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technicians at Bulgaria's sole nuclear
plant shut down two of its five reactors today because of an
unspecified breakdown, the state BTA news agency reported.
   The brief dispatch said the mishap occurred outside the plant's
nuclear reactor core, but offered no other details.
   It said the two reactors, one with a capacity of 400 megawatts
and another of 1,000 megawatts, were shut down as a precaution.
   The breakdown occurred less than a week after international
experts expressed concern about safety at the plant and a day after
Premier Andrei Lukanov pledged to shut it down if international
safety standards could not be met.
   A review by the International Atomic Energy Agency found there
were not enough senior operators or engineers at the plant at
Kozlodui, located on the Danube River in northern Bulgaria.
   Earlier this month, workers at Kozlodui warned that a sixth
reactor now under construction is flawed and could explode if
started up.
   Despite a worsening energy crisis that already has resulted in
some rationing of electricity, Lukanov said on Monday the plant,
which provides 30 percent of the country's electricity, would be
mothballed unless it could meet international safety standards.

   President Bush's ``patience is wearing thin''
in the Persian Gulf crisis, one lawmaker reported today after a
White House meeting that included discussion of possible military
action.
   Congressional leaders emerging from the meeting said they had
urged the president to explore all other avenues for resolving the
crisis and got no indication that U.S. military action was
imminent.
   ``His patience is wearing thin,'' said Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine, one of several lawmakers who met for an hour at the White
House with the president. But Cohen added, ``for the time being,
he's going to continue to pursue the course that we're currently
on.''
   Cohen said, ``there was no ... indication that we're at the
near-break point,'' for moving from sanctions to military action
against Iraq.
   Asked if Bush appeared to have a military strike on the front
burner, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said, ``It's certainly on the
burner and not ruled out.''
   ``There's concern on Capital Hill ... that this is somehow a
prelude to immediate military action,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said after the meeting. ``People want to make sure that options are
explored,'' he said.
   Participants described Bush as highly disturbed at reports of
atrocities in occupied Kuwait and the plight of U.S. Embassy
personnel and other Americans who have been blocked from leaving.
   The lawmakers said Bush sought their opinions in what Leahy
described as ``one of the livelier'' such sessions he has attended
with the president.
   ``Nobody asked the president to rule out a military option,''
Leahy said, ``But many of us told him to make sure that we don't
use the military option out of impatience, that we try the embargo
the sanctions, the United Nations resoultions, our allies efforts
first and foremost.''
   Cohen, who has been outspoken in saying that Bush must get
congressional approval before undertaking hostilities, said,
``There obviously is a difference of opinion in terms of whether
that power resides with the executive branch or the congressional
branch. I believe the president is doing his best to say `let's
work together' and that's precisely what the thrust of the meeting
was.''
   Bush met with the leaders a day after he declared that he
``would have no hesitancy'' to using force if provoked by Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein.
   At a picture-taking session at the beginning of the meeting,
Bush brushed off a reporter's question on reports that
administration officials plan to discuss a timetable with U.S.
allies for a possible military offensive.
   ``I could, but I'm not going to comment'' on the story in
today's editions of the Los Angeles Times, Bush said.
   The president also planned to meet with foreign policy advisers
today.
   The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war,
although the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
   Bush has held regular consultations with Congress on the gulf
crisis since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait prompted him to send
more than 200,000 troops to the region.
   But beyond that, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
recently the administration would not promise to get congressional
approval if a decision was made to engage in armed conflict with
Iraq.
   Baker was responding to calls by some lawmakers that Congress be
called back into session to approve such an escalation.
   Bush told reporters Monday, ``I know the authorities that a
president has. I'm working to try to get this matter resolved
peacefully. We have a lot of force there and they're well-trained,
they're highly motivated, and that alone is sending an enormously
strong signal to Saddam Hussein.''
   He noted he was consulting with congressional leaders today,
adding: ``But history is replete with examples where the president
has had to take action. And I've done this in the past and
certainly - somebody mentioned provocation - would have no
hesitancy at all.''
   Bush and Baker both took a harder line toward Iraq on Monday
while still saying they want to see a diplomatic solution if
possible.
   ``Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a possible use of force
if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait,'' Baker said in a speech in Los
Angeles.
   Baker said Saddam ``must realize there is a limit to the
international community's patience. He must also realize that
should he use chemical or biological weapons, there will be the
most severe consequences.''

<TEXT>
   Jim Bakker, the former televangelist
convicted of defrauding his followers, was denied a fair trial and
his sentence was excessive, his attorneys told a federal appeals
court today.
   Most of the nearly 90-minute hearing before the 4th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals focused on Bakker's 45-year sentence for 24 counts
of wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy.
   Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard University law professor brought in
for Bakker's appeal, said U.S. District Judge Robert Potter of
Charlotte, N.C., made an ``incredible departure'' from federal
sentencing guidelines.
   He said Bakker would have received a sentence of two to four
years if the guidelines had been used. He asked that Bakker be
resentenced by another judge.
   ``We, your honors, will take our chances,'' Dershowitz said.
``Let the chips fall where they may.''
   Deborah Smith, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer, said Bakker
would be eligible for parole after serving 10 years and could have
received as much as 12 years without parole under the guidelines.
   ``I don't think this is a case where there is a broad
disparity,'' she said.
   She said the judge did not have to apply the guidelines because
the crimes took place before November 1987, when the guidelines
took effect.
   Judges J. Harvie Wilkinson III, J. Dickson Phillips Jr. and John
D. Butzner Jr. will decide whether to uphold Bakker's conviction
and sentence. The founder of the PTL television ministry is serving
his sentence at a federal prison in Rochester, Minn.
   Bakker was convicted of bilking followers of his television
ministry out of millions of dollars. Three other former PTL
officials also have been convicted for their roles in the scheme.
   In a brief filed with the appeals court, Bakker's attorneys also
said Potter was influenced by his religious beliefs when he gave
Bakker an overly harsh sentence.
   Before sentencing Bakker a year ago, Potter said the
televangelist ``had no thought whatsever about his victims, and
those of us who do have a religion are ridiculed as being saps
(for) money-grubbing preachers or priests.''
   The lawyers also argued that Potter failed to ensure that Bakker
got a fair and impartial jury because the judge refused to move the
trial out of Charlotte and refused to sequester the jury during the
trial.
   They said Potter should have delayed the trial after Bakker was
hospitalized briefly at a federal prison in Butner, N.C., for a
competency examination. Potter ordered the evaluation after
Bakker's attorneys said he was depressed and began hallucinating
after leaving court the previous day.
   Bakker was declared fit to stand trial and the trial resumed.

<HEAD>Bush Ethics Order Gives White House Lawyer Power to Police Himself</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has granted White House Counsel
C. Boyden Gray a power denied everyone else in government -
authority to permit himself to decide issues in which he might have
a conflict of interest.
   The authority is contained in a new presidential order on ethics
issued Oct. 17. White House and federal ethics officials who helped
prepare the order expressed surprise this past week when shown that
the document authorizes Gray to exempt his own actions from
criminal conflict-of-interest laws.
   Nevertheless they were confident that Gray, who once said ``I
was my own ethics officer'' while counsel to then-Vice President
Bush, would never actually use the authority. Gray himself declined
to respond to a week's worth of telephone calls.
   ``Mr. Gray would never grant a waiver for himself,'' said deputy
White House press secretary Alixe Glen. ``In the event that that
hypothetically were to ever come up, the president would be the
decider.''
   Government employees who take official action that could affect
their personal or family finances are subject to criminal
penalties. However, a supervisor can allow an employee to
participate in a particular case anyway by ruling in advance that
the employee's financial interest is ``too remote or too
inconsequential'' to influence his or her decision. That ruling
waives the penalties.
   Ms. Glen said last week's order contained minor ``fine-tuning''
- only a handful of changes in five pages of rules - in the ethics
order Bush issued last year for executive branch employees.
   In the new version, Bush gave Gray his authority to waive the
conflict-of-interest penalties for certain White House staffers.
   Neither Gray nor those staffers are mentioned by name, which may
be the reason for the oversight by government lawyers who prepared
the order for Bush.
   It says the counsel to the president - Gray - can grant waivers
to every employee hired under a specific section of federal law.
That section is the one under which Gray himself was hired.
   At the Office of Government Ethics, which polices executive
branch employees, General Counsel Gary Davis said the wording of
the new order was ``a technical point.''
   ``That's a quirk in the statute,'' Davis added. ``But that would
be the last thing he would ever do. That would be political
suicide. They would never in 100 years do that.''
   During his eight years as counsel to Vice President Bush, Gray,
a multimillionaire, served as chairman and trustee of his family's
cable television and broadcasting company, Summit Communications
Group, Inc. of Atlanta. He also received more than $200,000 in fees
from Summit during those years.
   Those arrangements were not barred at the office of the vice
president where Gray, by his own declaration, set the ethics rules.
   At the time, he was working side-by-side with Reagan White House
employees bound by unwritten policies that banned earning outside
income or serving on corporate boards.
   When Gray moved to the White House with Bush, he resigned the
corporate post, and he has put large blocks of his holdings into
two blind trusts. He still retains control over more than $1
million in assets and receives income from a family trust that also
has more than $1 million in assets, according to his 1990 financial
disclosure statement.
   The family trust contains more than $250,000 in Summit stock and
more than $250,000 in stock of Media General, a newspaper
publishing and television broadcasting corporation. Gray reported
dividends in 1989 of between $50,000 and $100,000 on the Summit
stock and between $15,000 and $50,000 on the Media General stock.
Also outside his blind trusts are substantial investments in real
estate limited partnerships, which are commonly used by the very
wealthy as tax shelters.
   Ms. Glen said Gray holds no current exemption from the conflict
statute and foresees no need of one.
   Presidential orders such as Bush's are regularly reviewed in
advance at the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.
   Larry Simms, a former deputy assistant attorney general who
served in that office during the Carter and Reagan administrations,
said such a drafting error, ``ought to be pointed out.''
   ``It ought to be changed or some document put in the record to
clarify the intent. Someday everyone who drafted it (with an
unstated intent) will be dead,'' Simms said.
   Asked if an amendment or clarifying document were planned, Ms.
Glen said, ``It's not considered necessary to amend it, because it
is evident that one cannot decide a waiver for oneself.''

   Florence and Hildred Newsom have gone
through tough times and good times on their farm, even through
cancer surgery. But the two elderly sisters wouldn't live anywhere
else.
   Florence, 75, took care of the cattle while 70-year-old Hildred
cooked, cleaned, made the cottage cheese for their dairy route and
delivered eggs to dozens of customers.
   That was the routine the sisters followed before they had cancer
surgery during the same week last May. Now, they take life easier,
but not much easier.
   ``Everything came to a screeching halt when she went to the
hospital April 30,'' Hildred recalled.
   ``She told the nurse down at the hospital that she knew
something was wrong because she couldn't lift two bales at one
time.''
   Shortly after Florence was hospitalized for colon cancer
surgery, Hildred checked into the hospital for a mastectomy.
   Hildred was released from the hospital in May, but Florence
suffered two small strokes after her surgery and was in therapy
until July.
   Hildred nursed her sister back to health, giving her medicine 14
times a day and setting out a table of fruits, nuts and candy to
encourage her to eat in between meals so she'd put on some pounds.
   Florence did her part by lifting 2-pound rocks in each arm and
rolling a hay bale back and forth. It's a type of therapy she
prescribed for herself.
   ``I'd roll it up and back and up and back and every 10th time
I'd lift it,'' Florence said.
   The two sisters never married. When Florence was younger, she
took care of the livestock and raked and hauled hay with a 1952
tractor, while her brother, Melvin, who now lives in Bismarck,
raised the crops.
   ``I worked 16-hour days and then came in at night and read and
wrote,'' Florence said. ``Any white piece of paper was a
challenge.''
   She published her first story in the ``Dakota Farmer'' when she
was 10 and continued writing for the magazine for several years.
For the last 15 years she's written a weekly column called ``By the
Way'' for the Herald-Press in Harvey.
   Most of her columns are about nature. She's a student of birds,
rocks, grass. She can hear a flock of geese flying over the
farmyard long before someone with an untrained ear.
   Her keen interest in nature led her to become an observer for
the National Weather Service. She recently received a citation for
recording barometric pressure, wind direction and precipitation
daily for 10 years.
   While Hildred doesn't talk about nature as much as Florence, she
loves living on the farm. She lived in Bismarck in the late 1950s
and '60s before returning to the farm to help care for her mother,
who was ill.
   The pace has slowed for the sisters now. They sold their 100
hens a couple of weeks ago and don't milk the cow anymore.
   But don't ask them to leave the farm.
   ``People in town are telling us we shouldn't be out here,''
Hildred said. ``There's a businessman in town who says he has a
house picked out for us.
   ``I don't want to live in town. Twelve years of it was enough.''

   A pipe ruptured today in the boiler room
of the USS Iwo Jima, releasing steam that killed eight American
sailors and severely injured two.
   In a separate accident, one Marine was killed and three others
were injured today when the vehicle they were traveling in
overturned in the Saudi desert, the U.S. military Joint Information
Bureau said in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
   The Information Bureau also reported today that three U.S. Navy
sailors traveling in a military pickup truck were injured Monday
when a U.S. Marine Corps sentry accidentally opened fire.
   The Iwo Jima's commander, Capt. Michael O'Hearn, called the
accident aboard the amphibious assault ship ``a terrible setback.''
   Cmdr. Mark Neuhart, spokesman for the U.S. Naval Forces Central
Command, said the steam line in the boiler room ruptured as the Iwo
Jima was sailing out of Bahrain after a routine port visit.
   The ship has been operating since Sept. 16 as part of the
Amphibious Task Force in support of Operation Desert Shield, the
Navy said.
   Neuhart said four sailors were critically injured. They were
taken to the hospital ship USS Comfort in the gulf, where two of
them later died.
   Neuhart said the names of the victims would be released after
their relatives have been notified. The bodies will be flown home
today, he said.
   The ship went back to Bahrain for inspection and assessment of
the damage, Neuhart said. Repairs will be done in Bahrain, he said.
   Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle, Navy spokesman in Dhahran, said steam in
a line such as the one that leaked could be as hot as 850 degrees.
   Interviewed by the Navy aboard his ship, O'Hearn said: ``We will
overcome this terrible setback. Our thoughts and prayers are with
the families of those who have departed us.''
   In addition to the deaths aboard the Iwo Jima and the fatality
in the desert accident today, 32 U.S. servicemen have died since
Operation Desert Shield began Aug. 7, five days after Iraqi troops
overran Kuwait.
   The Iwo Jima, based in Norfolk, Va., has a crew of 685 officers
and crewmen and about 1,100 Marines. The victims were all crew
members, Neuhart said.
   The 602-foot-long, 84-foot-wide vessel displaces 18,000 tons.
   It was the second fatal accident aboard a U.S. Navy vessel since
the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait prompted the American miliary
deployment. On Aug. 21, an electrician's mate was electrocuted
aboard the USS Antietam.
   The worst previous incident linked to Operation Desert Shield
occurred Aug. 29 when a C-5A transport aircraft loaded with
supplies for U.S. forces in the gulf crashed and burned shortly
after takeoff in Germany, killing 13 crew members.
   In the desert accident, a Marine from the 1st Batallion, 3rd
Marine died and three others were injured when their High Mobility
multipurpose vehicle, known as a Humvee, overturned.
   The four had been participating in a routine night exercise when
their vehicle went over an embankment and dropped approximately 20
feet, the U.S. military command said in a statement.
   It said the three injured Marines were in stable condition. The
four names were withheld pending notification of next of kin.
   In the accident Monday involving the sailors and the Marine
sentry, the sentry fired two 50-caliber rounds of ammunition at the
pickup carrying the sailors, the military information bureau said.
It said only that the sailors were approaching the entrance to a
facility being used by the Marine Corps.
   One sailor was struck by the bullet, the second was injured by
glass shards and the third suffered a concussion. All three were
evacuated to the Comfort. Their names also were witheld pending
notification of next of kin.

<HEAD>Despite Problems, Dyson Holding His Own in Congressional Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EASTON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Roy Dyson never really stopped
campaigning after he came within a hair of losing his House seat to
Republican Wayne Gilchrest in 1988.
   Dyson, a five-term Democrat from Maryland's 1st District, has
been pummelled in the last two years by questions about his ties to
defense contractors, the suicide of his chief aide and improper
campaign financing.
   Most recently, the hawkish Dyson was criticized for being a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. Gilchrest won the
Purple Heart for his service in Vietnam.
   But Dyson's tenacity has made the rematch with Gilchrest, a race
that GOP leaders had thought was sure to go their way this year,
too close to call.
   ``I have no idea'' why Dyson is doing so well, said Liz Hamel,
spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee,
which put Dyson near the top of its hit list of vulnerable
Democratic representatives.
   ``He's just a complete embarrassment,'' she said. ``Hopefully,
this time the voters will realize it.''
   Dyson campaign manager Chris Robinson says the Democrat made a
``prodigious rehabilitation effort'' after political novice
Gilchrest came within 1,400 votes of upsetting him two years ago.
   ``When the campaign was over in 1988, we went right back to
work,'' Robinson said. ``(Dyson) attended 70 town meetings in the
last two years. We never stopped.''
   Dyson must not only overcome the ethical questions that have
beset his campaign, but also the anti-incumbency mood that has
settled on the district.
   Gilchrest, a quiet, likeable schoolteacher, is the antithesis of
the professional politician.
   On leave from his teaching job, Gilchrest is waging a low-tech,
tight budget campaign. He spends 18-hour days shaking hands and
addressing the issues.
   He's paid $208 a week from his campaign chest.
   Campaign manager Tony Caligiuri says voters see Gilchrest as
``someone they can talk with.''
   But other GOP officials say they're afraid that Gilchrest's
diffidence - sometimes to the point of shyness - is a liability. He
needs to toughen his message, supporters say privately, adding that
his nice-guy campaign is letting Dyson off too easy.
   ``I haven't liked negative campaigns per se. That's not my
style,'' Gilchrest said.
   He has disavowed two television ads paid for by the independent
Free State Republican Fund that bitterly attack Dyson.
   Dyson contends the group is working with Gilchrest.
   ``They are like tag-team wrestlers,'' Dyson said. ``Gilchrest is
trying to come off as Mr. Clean, while the Free State Republicans
throw mud.''
   Gilchrest's major problem is money.
   Dyson had collected more than $650,000 in campaign contributions
through Oct. 17, much of it from political action committees
associated with organized labor, agriculture and defense. Dyson had
raised $177,000.
   Dyson, who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, has been
in trouble since 1988 when his name surfaced in connection with the
Pentagon procurement scandal.
   While never the subject of an investigation, Dyson accepted
$18,000 in contributions from defense industry lobbyists later
convicted of bribery. He returned the money last year.
   In May 1988, Dyson's top aide and political mentor, Tom Pappas,
committed suicide the day The Washington Post reported that he had
recruited single young men for Dyson's staff and required them to
spend their free time socializing with him and other staff members.
   In 1989, Dyson was fined by the Federal Election Commission for
irregularities in his campaign finance reports.
   Then, late this summer, Dyson revealed that he had been a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam War. The announcement
came a day after The Washington Post sought an interview to discuss
his draft records.
   The Gilchrest camp capitalized on that revelation, airing ads by
Adrian Cronauer, the former military disc jockey made famous by the
movie, ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
   ``I want to tell you about Wayne Gilchrest, a Marine who won the
Purple Heart and the Bronze Star in Vietnam,'' Cronauer says in the
radio ad. ``Wayne Gilchrest is a man of character who answered the
call then ... and now he's ready to serve his country once more.''
   Former Republican state Sen. Porter Hopkins, who lost to Dyson
in 1982, rates Gilchrest's chances at 50-50. However, he said Dyson
is more in tune politically with the conservative district than the
more moderate Gilchrest.
   ``As far as Gilchrest is concerned, people admire his guts ...
but I detect a good number of people who think he's too liberal i
a number of areas,'' Hopkins said.

<HEAD>Old Revolutionary Bemoans Abandoning of Term `Comrade'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old revolutionary scolded his countrymen
Tuesday for abandoning use of the term ``comrade,'' once a common
form of address in Communist China.
   ``Some people say `comrade' ... is out of date now. This is
muddled thinking,'' Li Huang said in a signed commentary in the
People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper.
   ``I still consider being called comrade the greatest honor.''
   In the early days of Chinese communism, he said, the term
``comrade'' meant respect, admiration and common aspirations.
``When (you) encountered difficulties, a comrade would give (you)
faith and wisdom,'' Li said.
   But in recent years, the term has become increasingly rare in
China's large cities as people switch to using professional titles
or simply calling ``Miss'' or ``Sir'' to get a shop attendant's
attention.
   Li contended that using professional titles reflects a return to
the class system of old China and confused political thinking.
   ``That we can today call each other comrade is not ... a simple
thing. It symbolizes the victory of the revolution and was
exchanged for the blood of countless martyrs,'' said Li, who
described himself as a retired Communist Party member.
   The paper's editorial department said by telephone that Li was
an old cadre from Jilin province, but it could provide no other
biographical information.
   A man by the same name was listed in government directories as
being a ranking party official in northeast China's Liaoning
province from the 1950s to the 1970s, but it was not known if he
was the same Li who wrote the commentary.
   Li railed against television and radio shows that refer to
``audience friends'' rather than ``audience comrades.''
   He said he called a station to ask why ``comrades'' had been
dropped and was told that not everyone in the audience is
necessarily a ``comrade'' and that the term carries political
overtones.
   But Li countered, ``Can you say that everyone in the audience is
a friend? ... (And) to be socialist is to be political. What's to
fear in being too political?''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during a
visit to Islamic and European countries to discuss the Persian Gulf
crisis, the State Department said Tuesday.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said they will
meet Nov. 9 at an undisclosed location on the final stop of Baker's
week-long tour.
   Baker and Shevardnadze will also discuss arms control issues,
she said.
   Baker will confer on Sunday with officials in Bahrain and meet
with the Emir of Kuwait on Monday in Taif, Saudi Arabia. He will
confer with Saudi officials in Jiddah later that day.
   Ms. Tutwiler said Baker will spend Tuesday in Egypt and Turkey
and Wednesday in France. After meetings Thursday in Great Britain,
he will travel to another European country for talks Friday and
Saturday with Shevardnadze.
   Ms. Tutwiler emphasized the itinerary is subject to change.
Baker said on Monday he had no plans to visit Israel during the
trip because he wants toavoid the impression there is a link
between the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has attempted to draw parallels
between the two situations.

<HEAD>Archbishop Marcinkus Ends Four-Decade Vatican Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus, the American
prelate linked to Italy's biggest postwar banking scandal, said
Tuesday he was retiring and returning to the United States, ending
a four-decade Vatican career.
   The 68-year-old native of Cicero, Ill., who resigned from the
post he still held as deputy governor of the Vatican city-state,
said he planned to take up pastoral work in Chicago.
   Pope John Paul II accepted the resignation after repeated
requests from Marcinkus, the Vatican said. American bishops issued
statements praising Marcinkus and welcoming him back to the United
States.
   Marcinkus was president of the Vatican bank for 20 years, until
1989 when the job was eliminated under a reorganization of the
Institute of Religious Works, the bank's formal name. He has
maintained he was innocent of any wrongdoing.
   During his tenure, the Vatican finances were clouded by scandal.
Over the past decade, two Italian financiers with close ties to the
Vatican, Michele Sindona and Roberto Calvi, died under mysterious
circumstances.
   The 6-foot-4-inch prelate acted as a bodyguard to the pope
during his early foreign travels and seemed headed for promotion to
cardinal when the banking scandal broke.
   ``I have never done anything wrong,'' Marcinkus said Tuesday,
adding that some day ``I would like to set the record straight.''
   But he said: ``I don't want people to think I have sour grapes.
I want to leave here on a happy note.''
   Warrants for the arrest of Marcinkus and two lay Vatican bank
officials were issued in 1987. Italian prosecutors charged them
with being accessories to the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco
Ambrosiano, Italy's largest private bank, which collapsed in 1982
following the disappearance of $1.3 billion.
   But the arrests were never carried out. Italy's Constitutional
Court ruled that a Vatican-Italian treaty precluded any
interference by Italian authorities in the affairs of the Vatican,
an independent city-state.
   The missing money was in loans made to 10 fake companies in
Latin America controlled by the Vatican bank. Banco Ambrosiano had
loaned the money during the presidency of Calvi, popularlyknown as
``God's banker'' because of his close ties to the Vatican.
   Calvi was found hanging from a London bridge in June 1982.
   The Vatican bank, a major shareholder in Banco Ambrosiano,
agreed to pay $250 million to the Italian bank's creditors but
denied any wrongdoing.
   The scandal, however, led the Vatican to bring in leading lay
financial experts to manage the bank, a move that cost Marcinkus
his post.
   Marcinkus had been a familar figure on the golf course of one of
Rome's most exclusive clubs, but lowered his public profile
following the Ambrosiano case.
   The second financier, Sindona, who also advised the Vatican on
financial matters, died in March, 1986, while serving a life
sentence for ordering the death of a bank examiner investigating
his financial affairs. He died after drinking a poisoned cup of
coffee. A magistrate ruled he had committed suicide.
   In a statement, Marcinkus said he had spent 40 years away from
home and it was time to return.
   ``Now that I am free from administrative responsibilities, I
plan to return to the United States and make myself useful in
whatever pastoral work I may be able to do, much like many priests
of my diocese are doing,'' he said.
   Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, in a statement released by
the Vatican, praised Marcinkus for his ``great dedication to the
church and his personal integrity.''
   ``I have assured Archbishop Marcinkus, a native son, that the
door to his home diocese will always be open to him. The
archdiocese of Chicago is proud to claim him as a member of its
presbyterate,'' the statement said.
   Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, said: ``As spokesman for
the bishops of our country, I am pleased and proud to say, `Thanks
Paul. And welcome home.'''
   In its brief announcement, the Vatican said the pope named
Marcinkus a consultant to the commission overseeing the Vatican
city-state, essentially an honorary post that can be held while
living elsewhere.

   U.S. hostages in Iraq and Kuwait are suffering
a ``terrible ordeal,'' being fed inadequate diets and forced to
sleep on vermin-ridden floors, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III says.
   Baker shed new light on the hostages' plight in a speech Monday
in Los Angeles. A text was made available by the State Department.
   ``They are kept in the dark during the day and moved only at
night,'' Baker said. ``They have had their meals cut to two a day.
And many are becoming sick as they endure a terrible ordeal.''
   Baker will embark on a week-long visit to Arab and European
countries starting Saturday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said today. The purpose will be to consult on futurnited States
is ``exhausting
every diplomatic avenue'' to achieve peace in the Persian Gulf, but
warned that military action may be taken against Iraq if it
continues to occupy Kuwait.
   ``Saddam Hussein must realize there is a limit to the
international community's patience,'' Baker said. ``He must also
realize that should he use chemical or biological weapons, there
will be the most severe consequences.''
   Baker reaffirmed that the United States strongly prefers a
peaceful solution consistent with the mandate of U.N. Security
Council resolutions.
   ``We are exhausting every diplomatic avenue to achieve such a
solution without further bloodshed,'' he said.
   He added: ``Let no one doubt: We will not rule out a possible
use of force if Iraq continues to occupy Kuwait.''
   Later, under questioning, Baker reaffirmed that American policy
toward the gulf cannot be influenced by the existence of almost
1,000 American hostages in Iraq and Kuwait even though their lives
may be endangered by military action.
   Asked about diplomatic efforts to achieve a solution, other
officials said the administration is closely monitoring efforts by
Soviet and Jordanian emissaries, among others, to determine whether
there is any flexibility in Iraq's position.
   Baker said that while the international community tries to build
on the successful ending of the Cold War, ``Saddam Hussein seems
hellbent on a revival of a hot war.''
   Baker asked, ``What can be the long-term meaning of Iraq's
extensive chemical and biological weapons program? Why is the Iraqi
dictator spending billions of dollars to build weapons of mass
destruction, including a nuclear bomb? And why has he turned
Baghdad into a haven for international terrorists? Surely, not
because he expects this aggression - first against Iran, now
against Kuwait - to be his last.''

   NASA fueled Columbia today for an
elaborate test to determine whether the shuttle is leak-free and
ready for an astronomy mission in December, and early results
indicated a tight spaceship.
   ``Managers are very happy with the testing so far,'' said NASA
spokeswoman Lisa Malone. ``All the work completed here by the
Kennedy Space Center launch team has proved to be successful.''
   Liquid hydrogen was pumped into Columbia's huge external tank
this afternoon. The engine compartment was fitted with 10 TV
cameras and 17 sensors to pinpoint any more of the dangerous leaks
that forced three of the shuttle's four launch postponements since
May.
   A small amount of hydrogen escaped into the engine compartment
during the test, but was well within allowable limits, Malone said.
Nevertheless, NASA continued filling the tank to make sure that
rate did not increase.
   NASA officials, meanwhile, set Nov. 9 as the launch date for
Atlantis, also grounded this summer by hydrogen leaks. The shuttle
was cleared for flight after a successful fueling test last week.
   Atlantis will carry into orbit a satellite that reportedly will
spy on Iraq. The launch is scheduled for sometime between 6:30 p.m.
and 10:30 p.m. EST; the precise time will not be announced until
nine minutes before liftoff because of the classified nature of the
Defense Department mission.
   A successful test on the repaired Columbia would allow NASA to
move ahead with plans for a December launch with the $150 million
Astro observatory. That would enable NASA to close the year with
six shuttle flights, three fewer than planned.
   ``I've been optimistic before and I've been disappointed, so I'm
trying to stay calm,'' Bascom Murrah, a NASA official in charge of
Columbia's prelaunch operations, said Monday.
   Cameras and sensors were mounted in Columbia's engine
compartment, more monitoring equipment than for any other shuttle
fueling test. Suspect joints were covered with plastic bags.
   New hydrogen lines were installed, a crushed seal was replaced
and numerous joints were tightened to try to eliminate the leaks.
   Officials believe workers accidentally damaged components in the
engine compartment while searching for contamination following the
shuttle's last flight, in January.

<TEXT>
   Iraq said Tuesday it will not hand over a British
Airways Boeing 747 jetliner stranded at Kuwait airport until the
airline sends back Iraqi Airways engines it received for
maintenance.
   Shipments like the one demanded by Iraqi Airways are barred
under an embargo the United Nations imposed to force Iraq to
withdraw from occupied Kuwait.
   Apart from 15 Kuwait Airways planes captured by Iraq, the BA
jumbo jet is the only foreign plane that has remained in Iraq's
hands since the invasion.
   Iraqi Airways Chairman Noureddin Saffi said the British aircraft
``cannot be released until BA releases Iraqi Airways engines under
overhaul with BA.''
   The pilots and attendants of the British Airways flight were
trapped in Kuwait when their plane was captured during the Iraqi
invasion Aug. 2.
   But Saffi said the staff is ``free to travel abroad.''
   Saffi's comments were contained in a letter to Guenter Eser,
head of the International Air Transport Association, which
represents 200 member airlines.
   The group's general assembly on Monday demanded that Iraq
``release immediately all passengers including those in transit,
airline employees and aircraft'' held as a result of the invasion.

<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs, adds Chrysler negotiator declining comment. Also

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto
Workers union today agreed on a national contract for 63,000
workers in eight states.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said the terms were similar to those
of contracts with the nation's two biggest automakers.
   ``We have achieved a pattern settlement for our members here at
Chrysler,'' Bieber said after a private meeting with Chrysler
Chairman Lee Iacocca.
   Bieber declined to discuss details of the pact before it is
presented to union leaders and rank-and-file members. Chrysler
negotiator Anthony St. John also refused to disuss the contract.
   ``There are elements in that agreement which are particularly
helpful to Chrysler's case,'' he said without elaborating.
   The union's contract with Chrysler expired Sept. 14 and an
extension expired at midnight Monday. But the union urged its
members at the No. 3 automaker to stay on the job while talks
continued through the night. Bieber and Iacocca met this morning in
Iacocca's offices.
   The UAW already had reached new contracts with General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. and said it hoped to take many of the same
provisions to Chrysler, which was in more precarious financial
shape and which reported a $214 million third-quarter loss this
week.
   Chrysler had said it might be unable to afford the GM-Ford
pattern agreement, but the union wanted nothing less. Major issues
that remained unresolved Monday included job security, health care
and pensions.
   The strategy of extending a contract, then canceling the
extension even while asking union members to report to work puzzled
some UAW members. Some union workers said they were ready to strike
if the talks dragged on.
   But a source close to the bargaining who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``A strike is just unthinkable.'' The UAW last
struck Chrysler in 1985.
   Chrysler workers, after hearing for months from their union
leaders that they would settle for nothing less than the GM-Ford
agreement, have been wearing buttons in past weeks reading,
``Pattern or Pickets.''
   Among the main features of the pattern contract are income
guarantees for laid-off workers, pension increases and no change in
health care.
   The last two items could cause Chrysler the most problems.
Chrysler's ratio of nearly one retiree for every active worker is
much higher than GM's or Ford's.
   Consequently, Chrysler's health-care bill is higher than that of
the other automakers. The company said it spent about $684 million
in health care last year.
   In addition to Michigan, Missouri and Delaware, Chrysler has
plants in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, New York and Ohio.

   Government forces fired on thousands of
Hindu fundamentalists who broke through police barricades Tuesday
and forced their way into a heavily guarded mosque. Five Hindus
were killed and 20 wounded.
   At least 26 people were killed in other parts of India as the
decades-old dispute between Hindus and Moslems over ownership of
the site came to a head.
   The controversy has left at least 138 people dead in the past
week, brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government close to
collapse and further strained already tense relations between
India's Hindu majority and Moslem minority.

   Moslem mosque, on Tuesday repeated his offer to resign if his party
thought it would help contain the sectarian violence. He made a
similar offer Monday.
   Hindu fundamentalists had said they would start construction
Tuesday on a temple to the god Rama on the site occupied by the
mosque. The government said it would block any attempt to destroy
the small, one-story shrine and arrested 90,000 supporters of the
fundamentalist World Hindu Council in the past week.
   On Tuesday, 10,000 Hindus stormed police barricades outside the
disputed shrine. Police first used tear gas and bamboo canes to
beat back the crowd.
   Then, after several hours of clashes as the crowds pushed closer
and closer to the mosque, the police fired rifles.
   Reporters saw four bodies, but a government spokesman in New
Delhi later said five people were killed. Witnesses said at least
20 people were wounded.
   S.K. Gupta, a doctor at a local hospital, said 13 of the injured
were in serious condition. ``They have only 10 percent chances of
survival,'' he said.
   Thousands of young men wearing orange headbands, the color of
the Hind faith, broke through successive police cordons, entered
the small mosque, pried bricks from the wall and chipped bits of
plaster from its three domes. They planted an orange flag on each
dome before police chased them away.
   Many Hindus said they were helped by policemen guarding the
mosque, which the fundamentalists say stands on the spot where Rama
was born. Most of the 20,000 policemen on duty in Ayodhya are
Hindus.
   While the crowds rushed toward the mosque, Hindu holy men
screamed obscenities from rooftops and pelted police with stones.
At least four policemen were injured.
   As news spread that the police barricades had been breached,
hundreds of Hindus poured into the streets of Ayodhya in defiance
of the 4-day-old curfew that had confined them to their homes. Many
distributed candy and exploded firecrackers to shouts of ``Jai siya
Rama!'' - ``Victory to Rama!''
   Many policemen were seen entering the disputed shrine to pray.
   The World Hindu Council said its success in penetrating police
lines meant the temple project had begun.
   ``In my 19 years of service, I have never experienced such a
sense of failure,'' a senior government official at the site said
on condition of anonymity. ``It was a collapse of the
administration.''
   Later, paramilitary troops cleared the shrine of intruders and
threatened to open fire if any further attempts were made to breach
the barricades.
   The government's chief spokesman, Ramamohan Rao, said the mosque
was not seriously damaged. He spoke in New Delhi, 300 miles
northwest of Ayodhya.
   In several towns hundreds of miles from Ayodhya, Hindus and
Moslems fought street battles and police opened fire on rioting
mobs. In those incidents, 25 were killed in street battles and the
police firing, while one Hindu committed suicide in protest.
   The army was called out in two towns in the western state of
Gujarat. Police in New Delhi said the situation in the capital was
tense and troops were alert for trouble.
   Prime Minister Singh's government lost its patchwork majority in
Parliament last week after The Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party
withdrew support over the government's stand on the Ayodhya
dispute.
   On Tuesday, Singh offered to resign if his party felt ``that
change of leadership will serve larger goals.''
   ``What is closest to my heart is that at this juncture the
country be saved from communal flames,'' Singh said in a letter to
his Janata Dal party president, Somappa Rayappa Bommai.
   Singh is scheduled to face a vote of confidence Nov. 7.
Bharatiya Janata has said it will oppose Singh's continuing in
office.
   The Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the
largest group in Parliament, has made a similar announcement. The
Congress and Bharatiya Janata together hold 281 seats - a majority
in the 522-member Parliament.
   Bharatiya Janata says Singh's policy on the dispute is aimed at
garnering Moslem votes. The Congress accused him of faulty
administration that brought the Hindu-Moslem dispute to a boil.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people.
Athough India is constitutionally a secular nation, Hindus comprise
82 percent of the population and have always held the prime
minister's post.
   At least 900 people were killed in Hindu-Moslem violence last
year after the Hindu group announced plans to replace the mosque
with a temple.

<HEAD>Thatcher Defends Rejection of EC Monetary Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, isolated in the
European Community and sliding in opinion polls at home, on Tuesday
defended her rejection of the European Community's leap toward
monetary union.
   In a rowdy Parliament session, opposition parties accused her of
``tantrum tactics,'' being rude to the other leaders and
undermining British influence at an EC summit in Rome over the
weekend.
   ``In my view, we have surrendered enough,'' Mrs. Thatcher told
lawmakers. ``What is the point of trying to get elected to
Parliament only to hand over your sterling and your powers to
Europe? ... It is not our policy to have a single currency imposed
on us.''
   The angry exchanges came when Mrs. Thatcher reported to
Parliament on the Rome meeting.
   Leaders of the other countries - including powerful Germany -
unexpectedly agreed to establish a joint central bank by Jan. 1,
1994, and a single currency possibly by the year 2000.
   Mrs. Thatcher argues that one currency infringes on national
sovereignty by robbing governments of the right to set interest
rates or run independent economic policies.
   ``Your tantrum tactics won't stop the process of change,'' said
Neil Kinnock, leader of the main opposition Labor Party. ``All they
do is strand Britain in some European second division.''
   Labor also opposes a single European currency and Kinnock
directed his attacks mainly at her tactics and confrontational
style.
   Paddy Ashdown, leader of the small centrist Liberal Democratic
Party, the only British party that supports the idea of some kind
of federal Europe, shouted at Mrs. Thatcher: ``You no longer speak
for Britain. You speak for the past.''
   The divisive issue of Britain's role in Europe has revived as
the Mrs. Thatcher slides deeper into trouble.
   Some worried legislators now say openly that Mrs. Thatcher
appears likely to lose the next election, which must be held by
mid-1992.
   Two opinion polls, by Harris and by Market and Opinion Research
International, published over the weekend showed Labor surging to a
16-point lead over the Conservatives, compared with 7 to 10 points
a month ago.
   The deficit in poll ratings has persisted for 16 months, and the
economic troubles - the main cause of the government's unpopularity
- show few signs of going away.
   The Confederation of British Industry, the main employers'
organization, on Tuesday issued its gloomiest report since Britain
plunged into recession in 1981, two years after Mrs. Thatcher came
to power. Half the 1,500 companies surveyed by the organization
reported falling orders and most said they had stopped hiring or
were laying off staff.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who has long fought lonely battles in the
12-member community, attacked her neighbors - particularly France
and Germany - for failing to agree to cut farm subsidies while
making commitments to grandiose plans for economic union and for
closer political ties.
   But she added: ``When we come to negotiate on particular points,
rather than concepts or generalities, I believe solutions will be
found which will enable the community to go forward as 12.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's most prominent labor
leader was arrested Tuesday, nearly a week after leading a
nationwide strike marked by unprecedented attacks on public
transport.
   Crispin Beltran, leader of the leftist May First Movement, was
arrested after he and Manila police chief Col. Ernesto Diokno
appeared on television to discuss the strike, which began last
Wednesday and was suspended Friday.
   During the program, Diokno said police had been looking for
Beltran since the strike because he allegedly had made seditious
statements. Beltran had been in hiding until appearing on the
program.
   Beltran was later led to a police car and driven to the Western
Police District headquarters. Diokno said he would be held
overnight and would be formally charged Wednesday with inciting
sedition and illegal assembly.
   Last week's strike was the most extensive since President
Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986 in the ``people power
revolution'' that toppled the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The strike, called to demand a 42 percent increase in the daily
minimum wage, paralyzed public transport in Manila and other
cities.
   Militants, believed to include Communist rebels, burned 23
buses, passenger jeeps and other vehicles during the labor unrest.
Such attacks had not taken place during previous strikes.
   On the day before the walkout, unknown assailants killed the
leader of a transport federation, Oscar Lazaro, who had refused to
join the strike.
   Beltran's arrest was expected to increase tension between the
Aquino government and organized labor. The government has said the
strike was Communist-run, although the May First Movement denies
the claim.
   Beltran denied he was trying to overthrow the government and
said his activities were a legitimate right of organized labor.
   ``It's up to them to file charges but they should have
evidence,'' Beltran told reporters. ``What is clear is we are
exhausting all the avenues for a peaceful settlement of the
issues.''
   In a related development, a human rights group said Tuesday a
regional strike leader was slain by unknown assailants.
   The Catholic Church-backed Task Force Detainees branch in Bataan
province said Rey Olano, secretary-general of the Alliance of
Democratic Labor Organizations at the Bataan Export Processing
Zone, was shot Monday.
   Olano led affiliated unions in actions that paralyzed eight
companies for four days in Mariveles town, about 40 miles west of
Manila. He was shot by gunmen on a motorcycle, the group said.

   Filipino and American negotiators
will resume talks next month on the future of the U.S. military
bases in the Philippines, President Corazon Aquino said Tuesday.
   Speaking at a luncheon with foreign newsmen, Mrs. Aquino also
said the Philippines wanted to take over the giant Clark Air Base
north of Manila next year.
   But she said the government was considering American requests to
allow U.S. military air transit and the continued use of Crowe
Valley, a live-fire training range for U.S. jets located at Clark.
The subject will be among the matters taken up in the next round of
talks, she said.
   The United States maintains Clark, Subic Bay Naval Base and four
smaller facilities under an agreement that expires in September
1991. The Philippine constitution requires a treaty to keep the
facilities after 1991.
   Mrs. Aquino expressed hopes for a ``new relationship'' between
the United States and the Philippines ``not confined to the bases
alone.''
   ``I think it is best that the Philippines and the United States
view each other not only in regard to the bases but more
importantly on the overall relationship,'' she said.
   ``I, for one, am for retaining the friendship with the United
States. At the same time I would like for the United States
government to realize that our goal is one of national
sovereignty.''
   Philippine and U.S. negotiators held the first round of talks
last month. Mrs. Aquino said the next session would be held before
she leaves for Japan to attend the Nov. 12 enthronement ceremonies
for Emperor Akihito.

   Pumpkin Center has a convenience
store, general store and auto parts shop but nary a pumpkin patch.
   Henry Braswell, a 65-year-old former pumpkin farmer, said the
Walker County community hasn't had a pumpkin patch in about 45
years. Pumpkins were grown in the late 1800s and early 1900s, he
said, and that might have given the community its name.
   Braswell has another theory, however.
   A man who worked at his father's lumber company wanted to start
a baseball team, and chose Pumpkin Center as the name of the team
because of the numerous pumpkin patches at that time, Braswell
said.
   The community of 500, about 30 miles northwest of Birmingham,
then took its name from the baseball team, he said.

   American soldiers in Saudi Arabia are
suffering normal morale problems, but their spirits will rise when
the Pentagon announces plans in November for replacing them with
fresh units, a senior Army official said Tuesday.
   Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army's vice chief of staff, said
the service is taking numerous steps to improve morale, including
the possibility of leasing large cruise liners in the Persian Gulf
to give soldiers a break from desert training.
   ``It's tough. It's not an easy mission'' for the more than
100,000 soldiers in Saudi Arabia as part of Operation Desert Shield
to defend the desert kingdom against a possible Iraqi attack,
Sullivan said in an interview in his Pentagon office.
   The four-star general said the Bush administration will announce
within a couple of weeks its decision on when replacement forces
would be sent to begin the rotation process. He said the Army had
not been instructed to increase its total force in Saudi Arabia,
but that extra troops, if needed, likely would come from combat
units at U.S. bases in Germany that are scheduled to be closed next
year.
   The Army also could tap the remaining three armored divisions
based in the United States.
   On Monday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that as many as
100,000 more forces - beyond the roughly 240,000 soldiers, sailors,
airmen and marines already there - might be sent to the gulf area.
He did not say when more forces would go.
   Sullivan said the full contingent of soldiers assigned to Desert
Shield would be in place within a few days, and a shipment of
several hundred top-of-the-line M1A1 main battle tanks also is en
route to Saudi Arabia from Germany to replace older M1 tanks that
are less capable of handling a chemical attack.
   The biggest psychological lift for the troops, some of whom have
been in the Saudi desert for two months, will come when the Bush
administration announces a timetable for a rotation of fresh
forces, Sullivan said.
   The four-star general said the Army already has set in motion
the arrangements for mobilizing the first fresh units from the
United States and Europe, although no individual units have been
alerted to begin moving to the gulf.
   Sullivan acknowledged that some soldiers are grousing about not
knowing how long they'll be on duty in Saudi Arabia, where living
conditions on the front lines are harsh, but he said he was
satisfied that morale is not suffering unduly.
   ``The troops are in pretty good shape and they are not
experiencing what I consider to be inordinate morale problems,'' he
said. ``I don't see it.''
   Recent news reports based on interviews with soldiers and other
servicemen in the gulf area have portrayed the troops as losing
patience with the nagging uncertainty of when they might go home
and whether they'll be required to fight.
   Earlier this month, after complaining members of the Army's 24th
Mechanized Infantry Division were quoted in the New York Times, the
commanding general restricted access to reporters.
   Some private analysts say the tough conditions in the Saudi
desert should not be a reason for poor morale.
   ``Morale is a leadership problem,'' said James A. Blackwell Jr.,
a former Army commander of combat units and now a defense analyst
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington. ``Good leaders will have good morale under the most
distasteful and challenging circumstances.''
   Sullivan said that rotating troops in Saudi Arabia is
complicated by the fact that the Army intends to replace whole
units at a time, not make piecemeal substitutions of individual
soldiers. He said this would be the first time in history the Army
has rotated whole units, a strategy designed to avoid the loss of
unit cohesion that Army leaders saw during the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Court, Souter Hear Debate on Ban on Abortion Counseling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court began scrutinizing a ban on
abortion counseling at federally subsidized family planning clinics
Tuesday in arguments punctuated by pointed questions from new
Justice David H. Souter and fellow members.
   Souter voiced doubts about regulations that bar doctors and
family planning counselors from discussing abortion even with women
whose pregnancies are endangering their health.
   ``You are telling us the physician cannot perform his usual
professional responsibility,'' Souter told Solicitor General
Kenneth Starr, the Bush administration's top courtroom lawyer.
``You are telling us the secretary (of Health and Human Services)
in effect may preclude professional speech.''
   Starr, conceding the ban ``tilts against abortion,'' defended
its validity.
   Although fueled by the continuing struggle over abortion, the
legal dispute over the regulations centers on free-speech rights.
The court must decide whether the regulations comply with a 1970
federal law and, if so, whether they violate the Constitution.
   A decision is expected by July.
   The argument is over information available to the 5 million
low-income women who depend on family planning clinics and similar
health care providers.
   Last year, some 4,000 family planning clinics nationwide
received about $140 million in federal assistance.
   Enforcement of the regulations, issued by the Reagan
administration in 1988, has been blocked virtually everywhere by
legal challenges.
   None of the justices indicated any interest Tuesday in using the
case to alter the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized
abortion.
   Roe vs. Wade was not mentioned at all by Starr or Harvard law
professor Laurence Tribe, representing those who challenged the
regulations.
   ``This is strictly a First Amendment argument,'' Tribe told the
court.
   Four justices have criticized the 1973 ruling, and the court
last year gave states greater leeway to make abortions more
difficult to obtain. Souter, whose views on the issue are unknown,
is considered a pivotal vote for the future of legalized abortion.
   Souter's comments to Starr followed a series of questions in
which the newest justice focused on a hypothetical case of a
pregnant woman whose health is endangered by continuing her
pregnancy.
   Starr said a woman, if so diagnosed in a family planning clinic
receiving federal assistance, could be told about her health
problem but should not be given any advice regarding abortion.
   Starr argued that the government, in choosing how to spend
taxpayer money, may ban discussion of abortion as a family planning
technique.
   He said the 1988 regulations were sparked by a decision to keep
the abortion controversy out of the family planning program.
   But Tribe said barring doctors from discussing all options
``betrays a basic trust'' between a physician and patient.
   ``We depend upon our doctors to tell us the whole truth, no
matter who is paying the bill,'' Tribe said, adding that many
doctors believe it would be ``profoundly unethical'' to abide by
the regulations.
   Justices Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia appeared skeptical
about some points raised by Tribe's attack on the regulations.
   Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and John Paul Stevens posed most of
their questions to Starr, the government's lawyer. Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy also participated in the questioning, but Justices
Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun listened in silence.
   The family planning program was enacted in 1970 by Congress as
Title X of the Public Health Service Act. It pays for creating and
operating family planning clinics.
   The clinics always have been banned from using federal money to
perform abortions, but regulations until 1988 let the clinic staffs
tell women about the abortion option and make referrals.
   Under the 1988 regulations, a woman who visited a federally
funded clinic and asked about abortion would have to be told the
clinic staff ``does not consider abortion an appropriate method of
family planning.''
   Staff members then could offer help in obtaining prenatal care.

   Israeli forces shot and killed a Palestinian on
Tuesday after he stabbed a civilian security guard, and another
Arab was killed during a clash in a refugee camp.
   Also Tuesday, one Palestinian was killed and two were injured
when a bomb they apparently were preparing went off in an
ultra-Orthodox Jewish suburb of Tel Aviv, police said.
   Angry Jews gathered in the market in Bnei Brak after the blast
and demanded that Arabs be barred from working in the community,
Israel's army radio reported.
   The violence was the latest in a series of assaults by both
Arabs and Jews following the Oct. 8 blood bath on the Temple Mount
in Jerusale. Police opened fire on Palestinians on the mount after
they had stoned worshipers at the Western Wall below. Twenty
Palestinians were killed and 140 wounded.
   Meanwhile, the Waqf, the Moslem religious council that oversees
the holy site, issued a report Tuesday on the killings, calling the
incident ``the day of the martyrs.''
   The report accused Israeli police and paramilitary border police
``of shooting intensively with live ammunition, as if they were in
a real war.''
   It blamed police for setting off the incident by firing tear gas
at women worshipers outside a mosque without reason. Palestinians
responded with stones, and the police with gunfire, it said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's office responded to the Waqf
report by denouncing it as ``superficial, one-sided and
non-objective,'' Israel television reported.
   ``Several members of the Moslem council participated in some of
the incidents themselves, and this reflects the degree of the
report's credibility,'' the office reportedly added.
   Two earlier reports, released by Palestinian and Israeli human
rights groups, accused Israeli police of indiscriminate fire on the
mount and urged Israel to seek non-lethal means of dealing with
rioters.
   A report by the Israeli government last Friday blamed
Palestinians stone throwers for setting off the rioting and said
police fired live ammunition in self-defense. But it also blamed
police commanders for being inadequately prepared.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens said, meanwhile, that the
continuing violence could mean that Israel will have to drop its
1988 peace plan calling for elections among Palestinians as a step
toward negotiations.
   Arens told a parliamentary committee that ``it is difficult to
see how free and democratic elections can be held ... in an
atmosphere of violence,'' according to his aide, Danny Neveh.
   One of the Palestinian deaths Tuesday came in the West Bank city
of Nablus, where an Arab stabbed an Israeli armed guard on a
gasoline tanker truck, the army said.
   Israel army radio said the guard was stabbed three times in the
back and a plainclothes Israeli security man who was passing shot
the attacker to death. The guard suffered moderate wounds.
   Three masked Palestinians announced through a loudspeaker that
the slain assailant, identified as 18-year-old Haitham Jamla, was a
member of Islamic Jihad, a Moslem fundamentalist group that was
outlawed by Israel on Monday.
   In neighboring Tulkarem, another Palestinian was fatally shot by
Israeli troops as they chased a group of Arab murder suspects, who
apparently refused orders to halt, the army said.
   Three other Arabs were wounded in other confrontations with
stone-throwers that ended with a curfew on the camp.
   The deaths brought to 768 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis in the 34-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation in the territories.
   An additional 292 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
Fifty-one Israelis have died in the violence.
   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, a policeman was slightly wounded when
he was stabbed in the chest by an Arab near the walled Old City,
police said. His assailant was arrested.
   In the West Bank, the army demolished five Palestinian homes,
including that of Omar Abu Sirhan, 19, who was arrested for the
slaying of three Israelis in Jerusalem last week.
   Abu Sirhan's father lost an appeal to the Israeli Supreme Court
to have the home spared. Twenty-two members of the family lived in
the three-story house in the village of Ubbadiyeh.
   Israeli troops have demolished more than 300 houses in the
34-month uprising to punish anti-Israeli activists. The Supreme
Court is known to have reversed only one army demolition order.
   The four other houses demolished Tuesday were in the town of
Sinjil north of Jerusalem, the army said. A resident in each house
was suspected of killing collaborators, it said.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Threaten to Kill Kidnapped Journalists</HEAD>

   Drug traffickers threatened to execute
seven journalists they are holding if the government launches a new
offensive against them, according to a statement sent to news
organizations Tuesday.
   The statement, bearing the letterhead ``The Extraditables,'' as
the Medellin cocaine cartel calls itself, marked the first time the
traffickers admitted holding the journalists, kidnapped over the
past two months.
   The abductions are ``a response to the violation of our
rights,'' the statement said.
   Among the abducted reporters were Francisco Santos, news editor
of the country's leading newspaper, El Tiempo, and Diana Turbay,
daughter of former president Julio Cesar Turbay.
   The traffickers said they had learned of a government plot to
kidnap family members of drug barrons, presumably to swap them for
the journalists.
   ``If something of this nature happens, our response will be
immediate and we will execute the detained journalists,'' the
statement said.
   In the statement, the Extraditables also said they would kill
family members of officials participating in such a kidnapping
operation.
   They said they would attack ``political leaders who sponsor and
support the criminal and genocidal police.''
   Earlier this year, the cartel was blamed for killing about 10
percent of the police force in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest
city. About 250 police officers died in the attacks.
   Since drug traffickers and the government declared war on each
other in August 1989, the Medellin cartel has killed about 550
Colombians in a long series of terrorist attacks, authorities say.
   Their latest offense was kidnapping the seven journalists and
Marina Montoya, the sister of Colombia's ambassador to Canada.
   Drug traffickers are apparently trying to force the government
of President Cesar Gaviria to grant them a pardon. They also want
Gaviria to end the government policy of extraditing accused drug
traffickers to the United States.
   Tuesday's statement included the cartel's now familiar motto:
``We prefer a tomb in Colombia to a jail cell in the United
States.''
   Three of the abducted, Santos, Montoya and Turbay, belong to
families that wield tremendous political and economic power in
Colombia.
   The Extraditables said judicial police chief Col. Oscar Pelaez
was responsible for, ``all the massacres committed against innocent
young people in the city of Medellin.''
   They said Pelaez's men killed Luis Gaviria, a relative of the
Medellin cartel's leader, after torturing him for ``six hours in
front of his family.''
   Police said Gaviria, first cousin of cartel boss Pablo Escobar,
died in a shootout with security forces on Oct. 23.
   Gaviria, who is not related to President Gaviria, had helped run
the cartel's cocaine smuggling operations as well as its terrorist
network, police said.
   Earlier Tuesday, a statement from two of the kidnapped
journalists was read over national radio.
   Turbay and Azucena Lievano, producer of TV's Cripton News, said
they and four other abducted reporters were in good condition.
Lievano said they needed a ``miracle: our freedom.''
   The statement made no mention of Santos, kidnapped in a bloody
shootout two and a half weeks after the other journalists.

   Nelson Mandela received a standing ovation in
Japan's parliament on Tuesday, but the black South African leader
did not get the financial aid he was seeking for his African
National Congress.
   Mandela said he was honored by the unusual chance for a
foreigner who is not a head of state to address a joint
parliamentary session.
   In his 15-minute speech, Mandela called the lifting of the state
of emergency and other recent reforms in South Africa a ``cause for
optimism and encouragement.'' But he said the ANC was handicapped
in trying to achieve an end to apartheid by its lack of resources.
   The visitors' gallery in the wood-paneled chamber was full as
lawmakers listened to Mandela's speech, translated into Japanese
over earphones.
   Later, Mandela held a news conference at which he complained
about Japan's contribution to the anti-apartheid movement.
   He said that of four countries he has visited on an Asia-Pacific
tour, only Japan has failed to pledge money to his African National
Congress, the largest anti-apartheid group in South Africa.
   Mandela, 72, said he had asked the Japanese government to
contribute $25 million to the ANC to help it achieve stability and
negotiate with the South African government for an end to
apartheid.
   ``The Japanese government has disclosed that they have already
spent $1.8 million toward assisting in improving the conditions of
our people in South Africa,'' he said. Compared to aid from other
nations, ``the contribution of the Japanese government is
absolutely insignificant,'' Mandela said.
   On Monday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Mandela that Japan
could not provide aid to the ANC because of its policy of not
giving assistance to political parties in other nations. Kaifu said
his government would provide aid to grass-roots South African
groups, however.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Japan has the ``political
will'' to give money to the ANC, but has been looking for
non-governmental organizations through which to channel the funds.
   ``We really have to establish some sort of framework through
which we can expand our aid activities to the African National
Congress, and we are about to start this kind of plan-making,''
ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.
   He said Japan had not been forewarned of Mandela's $25 million
request.
   Foreign Ministry officials say they welcome recent reforms in
South Africa and suggest Japan may lift some of its sanctions
against Pretoria in the area of personnel exchanges.
   Mandela called for all international sanctions to be retained
until democracy is achieved. ``We are not prepared to ask the
international community for the removal of sanctions until we have
the principle of one man, one vote,'' he said.
   Japan also bans private investment in South Africa, limits
diplomatic ties to the consular level and prohibits imports of
South African iron and steel.
   Asked about recent comments by Japanese Justice Minister Seiroku
Kajiyama -who compared foreign prostitutes in Japan to blacks in
the United States, saying both ``ruin the atmosphere'' of
neighborhoods they enter - Mandela called himself ``an enemy of
racism in whatever form it takes.''
   ``But at the same time, I believe this is a matter which is best
left to the Japanese people to resolve,'' he said.
   In his request for aid, Mandela asked for help in reducing
poverty and illiteracy among South African blacks and in creating
jobs for the thousands of exiles and political prisoners expected
to return to South African society.
   Mandela said Australia had promised to provide $15 million,
Indonesia $10 million and India $6.5 million during his visits to
those countries. He plans to visit Malaysia after leaving Japan on
Thursday.
   Japan was South Africa's second-largest trading partner last
year after West Germany, with two-way trade totaling $3.75 billion,
Japanese figures show.

   About 30 high school students cut class to
picket the courthouse, asking for leniency for their teacher, who
is charged with shooting a colleague he found in a tryst with his
wife.
   Allan Sicks, a photography teacher at Campbell County High
School, was charged in June with aggravated assault and aggravated
burglary for allegedly wounding fellow teacher Dan Chaney.
   He found Chaney with his wife - also a high school teacher - in
a camper at a Gillette picnic area. The couple never denied having
an affair.
   Jury selection began this week for the trial.
   Students chanted ``Support Mr. Sicks,'' and carried signs
reading ``Have Sympathy 4 Mr. Sicks,'' and ``He's Lost Enough, Why
Take More?''
   Ryan Bolton and J.C. Reynolds, both 17-year-old seniors,
organized the 90-minute rally Monday.
   ``We don't think it's fair at all,'' Reynolds said. ``This shows
this community we care. We'd like to see Mr. Sicks come out just as
good as everybody else on the whole deal.''
   Sicks resigned in July. Paula Sicks and Chaney still teach at
the high school. The Sicks are in the midst of a divorce.

<HEAD>Cuban Govt. Says No Exile Contacts About Transition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fidel Castro's government has made ``no official
contacts'' with any Cuban exile groups in the United States that
are pushing for democracy in the communist island nation, a Cuban
government spokesman said Tuesday.
   Jorge Ruiz, who is with the Cuban Interest Section in
Washington, D.C., made the comments in response to a report Friday
that quoted Cuban Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez as saying
the government had opened talks with moderate Cuban exiles who seek
a peaceful change in government.
   Ruiz said Rodriquez's comments were misinterpreted and no talks
about government transition were in progress now, not even ``with
the ... more neutral group.''
   ``He only has words for the (moderate) group in terms of we
could eventually sit down and talk to them,'' Ruiz said in a
telephone interview.
   ``But there wasn't even a suggestion it could happen in the near
future. The purpose of the interview - the position of the
government - just meant to describe how Rodriguez viewed the
positions of the Cuban (exile) community. It was not meant to be an
overture for possible talks,'' Ruiz said. ``There are no official
contacts now with any group.
   ``Obviously we're ruling out any communication with most
reactionaries,'' he said, referring to the longtime reactionaries
and the more conservative young Cubans who are pushing for
government change now.
   Cuban foreign ministry spokesman Hector Argiles on Monday denied
the reports of contacts ``with any counterrevolutionary
organization'' and said there has been ``no direct or indirect
contacts with representatives of those organizations.''
   The Miami Herald story Friday recounted an interview with
Rodriguez on Havana radio in which he discussed the various exile
groups in Miami.
   As Rodriguez described it: The three groups consist of a first
group of ``reactionaries'' who sought Castro's violent downfall; a
second group of exiles interested in bringing about family
reunification through increased travel and communication between
the United States and Cuba; and a third group that wants a dialogue
to peacefully replace Castro.
   In the interview, Rodriguez said, ``We are increasing relations
with the third group'' and then discussed the increasing travel
between Cuba and the United States.
   The Herald reported Sunday that the Rodriguez comments may have
been misinterpreted, largely because he ``misspoke'' when he
referred to ``increasing relations with the third group'' and
intended to refer to the second group wanting more travel and
communications with Cuba.
   But the Cuban government clearly stated this week that Rodriguez
was not discussing any contacts aimed at easing a transition to
democracy in Cuba.
   When Rodriguez' comments were monitored in Miami last week, some
exiles concluded that the Cuban official had acknowledged the first
formal political negotiations with exiles favoring a change of
government in Cuba.

   Jim Bakker's attorneys argued Tuesday that
the former televangelist received a 45-year prison sentence for
defrauding his followers because the judge was biased.
   Defense lawyers also argued at the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals that Bakker's conviction on 24 counts of fraud and
conspiracy should be overturned because of a faulty jury
instruction.
   The appeals court usually issues rulings within four to six
months of hearing arguments.
   The arguments focused on the sentence issued a year ago by U.S.
District Judge Robert Potter of Charlotte, N.C.
   Bakker, founder of the PTL Network, is serving his term in a
federal prison in Rochester, Minn.
   Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard University law professor assisting
Bakker's appeal, said Potter made an ``incredible departure'' from
federal sentencing guidelines.
   Dershowitz said the guidelines that took effect in November 1987
were intended to curb excessive sentences by judges like Potter,
who has been dubbed ``Maximum Bob.''
   He said Bakker would have received two to four years in prison
had Potter considered the guidelines.
   Dershowitz said if Bakker's conviction is not overturned, he
should be resentenced by another judge.
   ``We, your honors, will take our chances,'' he said. ``Let the
chips fall where they may.''
   Deborah Smith, a U.S. Justice Department lawyer who prosecuted
the case, said Potter did not have to follow the guidelines because
Bakker's crimes took place before November 1987.
   She said Bakker will be eligible for parole after 10 years and
could have received 12 years in prison without parole under the
guidelines.
   ``I don't think this is a case where there is a broad
disparity,'' she said.
   Dershowitz also said Potter was influenced by his religious
beliefs in sentencing Bakker.
   Moments before sentencing the founder of the PTL empire, Potter
said Bakker ``had no thought whatever about his victims, and those
of us who do have a religion are ridiculed as being saps (for)
money-grubbing preachers or priests.''
   Ms. Smith said those comments merely summarized the testimony
about religious belief that pervaded the trial.
   ``I don't think it at all reflects a personal bias on the part
of the judge but rather a reflection of what went on in that
courtroom,'' she said.
   In asking that the convictions be thrown out, defense attorneys
said Bakker was a religious visionary who acted with good
intentions.
   They challenged an instruction to jurors that they could convict
Bakker if he deceived followers in raising money for PTL ventures.
   Don Ervin, a Bakker attorney, said there is a difference between
deceiving and defrauding the followers.
   ``You can intend to deceive but not intend to defraud,'' Ervin
said. ``It is not against the law in this context to deceive.''
   ``This is a very technical argument ... dancing on the head of a
pin,'' replied Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who heard the case
with Judges J. Dickson Phillips Jr. and John D. Butzner Jr.
   Bakker was convicted for bilking followers of his television
ministry who contributed more than $158 million. Three other former
PTL officials also have been convicted.

   Marines in the Persian Gulf began an
amphibious assault training exercise Tuesday that a Pentagon source
said will feature a landing of more than 10,000 Marines on a beach
in Oman.
   The exercise, scheduled to last 10 days, is the second major
Marine practice of amphibious assault techniques that could be used
in the event President Bush ordered an offensive against Iraqi
forces in Kuwait. The first was conducted on an Omani beach in
September.
   Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, said the exercise involves
elements of the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and Amphibious
Task Group 2, which have been in the gulf as part of Operation
Desert Shield to defend Saudi Arabia against possible Iraqi attack.
   Hall called the maneuver a ``routine amphibious training
exercise'' designed to ``refamiliarize these forces with a desert
environment.'' He declined to specify the number of marines and
ships involved.
   A Pentagon source, speaking on condition he not be identified,
said 18 ships, including Marine Corps amphibious vessels and Navy
warships, will participate in the exercise, which he said also will
involve forces from allied gulf nations.
   Hall said 20 airplanes and 75 helicopters will be used in
staging the beach assault.
   The amphibious assault ship USS Iwo Jima was en route to the
exercise area Tuesday when a boiler pipe ruptured, killing eight
sailors and critically injuring two others.
   Hall said it had not been decided whether the 1,100 Marines
aboard the Iwo Jima would participate in the beach assault exercise
as planned.

<TEXT>
   Fulayyih Al-Azmi peered from his
tent one quiet, starry night to behold a U.S. Marine Corps tank
clanking just beyond his goat pen.
   ``My wife was afraid because it had no lights and she didn't
know what it was,'' he said through an interpreter.
   ``I couldn't speak their language, so I lit a lantern to let
them know I was here,'' he said inside his tent made of dark brown
camel hide and burlap feed sacks. ``So I don't move my herd at
night any more.''
   Al-Azmi is a Bedouin, one of the nomads of the Saudi Arabian
desert. He moves his 240 goats from pasture to pasture, if the
scrub that grows like sparse bristles on a brush can be considered
grazing land. He is guided by whim and weather without regard to
political lines on a map.
   But like other Bedouin, Al-Azmi is migrating from the north to
safer and less crowded southern lands because a 300,000-man force
of American, British, French and Arab armies has filled the sands
with monstrous metal machines.
   Home on the range is now home on the firing range.
   The forces gathered to counter Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
conquest of Kuwait need room to maneuver. And they also need miles
of desert to practice firing their tanks, artillery and rifles.
   The military is sensitive to Bedouin lifestyles and makes an
effort to be safe. But the Army has killed one camel and wounded
two others since it began live firing recently, said Lt. Col.
Arnold Laidig, a Marine officer.
   The Marines, for example, conduct sweeps with their helicopters
to make sure no herds wander into their ranges. They also patrol
the ranges in trucks before the shells start flying over the
tortured landscape.
   ``It may look like crap to us, but it's Kentucky blue grass to
them,'' said Lt. Col. Bruce Judge, a Marine operations and training
officer.
   ``Safety is a paramount concern,'' said Marine Capt. William
Taylor, a public affairs officer. ``It's like going into a farmer's
field and telling him we'd like to bust some big caps in your
backyard.''
   The clash of cultures is stark.
   A Bedouin tending his bleating livestock can see helicopters
flitting through the skies, armored columns rumbling across the
terrain and endless convoys of military trucks on the roads.
   On one night recently, a patrol of three Marine amphibious
assault vehicles passed within 25 yards of a Bedouin camp deep in
the desert. Goats were visible through night vision goggles, but
the soldiers said they never saw the camp.
   Another night patrol picked up movement on its sensors but
couldn't hear anything. It turned out to be a herd of 20 camels
passing by.
   Bedouin require lots of space to roam. Yet they say they welcome
the troops in the desert.
   ``I thank God the government is having people come to defend the
kingdom,'' Al-Azmi said, giving a visitor Arabic coffee, sweet tea
and fresh dates while sitting on a rug in the shade of a tent flap.
   ``Saddam Hussein should be punished. He attacked people who did
him no harm. God will punish him,'' he said.
   Although the Bedouin life is rustic, some have the luxuries of
modern life such as Mercedes Benz cars and cellular telephones. A
camel can fetch $2,500 at auction, and that's a lot to lose to an
errant artillery shell or a tank.
   On the advice of Saudi authorities, another Bedouin named
Abdullah Rajab prepared his herd of 70 camels for a journey south
and out of harm's way.
   ``Some of the troops came and drank tea with me. They were very
nice,'' Rajab said.
   As he spoke, dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers from
the British 7th ``Desert Rats'' Armored Brigade shook the ground as
they rumbled past his livestock.
   Their tracks scarred a desert once trodden only by animals and
herders.
   But the military also does good deeds in the desert. When Hassan
Rashed Alkhater of Jubail, the eastern Saudi industrial city, got
his pickup truck stuck in the sand, an army vehicle stopped to
help.
   ``I was waiting for 30 minutes for someone to help, and a
passing army vehicle pulled me out,'' said Alkhater, who owns 150
head of sheep and goats.

<HEAD>Missouri, Illinois Communities Feuding Over White Squirrels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARIONVILLE, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle for the title ``Home of the
White Squirrels'' is turning a little nutty.
   Marionville and Olney, Ill., both bill themselves as top spots
for white squirrel spotting. But Marionville boasts it has far more
than Olney.
   When Olney Central College biology instructor John Stencel
recently doubted that Marionville has as many white squirrels as it
claims, squirrel supporters in this southwestern Missouri community
took offense.
   ``I would welcome people from Olney to come here to count our
squirrels,'' said insurance agent Jim Smart, Marionville's leading
white squirrel promoter.
   Stencel and several volunteers recently counted 127 white
squirrels in Olney, down from last year's 143.
   Marionville in 1989 claimed to be home to about 1,000 of the
white rodents, or roughly half the number of people who live there.
   ``It's a lot of baloney,'' Stencel said. ``It's a publicity
stunt. They're just trying to get attention. They've never taken a
count so they don't have any official numbers.''
   The white squirrels in both towns are smaller than other
squirrels and have white fur, pink skin and pink eyes.
   Smart concedes the exact number of white squirrels living in the
Marionville area is not known.
   ``No, we have never taken an official count of white
squirrels,'' he said. ``I would like to know how you take such a
count. It's difficult to give much validity to a squirrel count.''

<HEAD>Payments Of $1.6 Billion To Be Paid Farmers In Conservation
Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 330,000 farmers participating in the
long-term Conservation Reserve Program soon will be getting $1.6
billion in rental payments for taking cropland from production,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday.
   The payments are for the 1991 fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
Yeutter said the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service will notify county offices to begin payments
immediately ``without any further delay.''
   During the recent budget-cutting maneuvers, it appeared the
payments would be delayed or even reduced. But Yeutter said full
cash payments will be made to cover contracts signed to place
cropland in the program during crop years 1986 through 1990.
   Under the program, farmers agree to idle highly erodible
cropland for 10 years. In return, the government helps pay the cost
of establishing protect grass or trees, and provides annual rental
payments for the land taken from production.
   The payments average nearly $50 per acre annually. Approximately
33.9 million acres have been signed up in the program.
   Yeutter's announcement was hailed by Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, as ``good
news for farmers who need to pay bills for this year's operations
and to make plans for next year.''
   De la Garza said the conservation program ``continues to play a
very important role'' in helping protect the environment.

   Columbia passed an elaborate fueling
test Tuesday after months of work to fix dangerous hydrogen leaks,
and a jubilant NASA said the shuttle will be prepared for a
December launch.
   ``We ended up with a tight ship,'' shuttle director Bob Crippen
said. ``As far as we're concerned right now, Columbia is ready to
go fly as soon just as we put it through its final launch preps.''
   It is the first time in five months all three spaceships are
clear for flight. Atlantis was found to be free of hydrogen leaks
during a fueling test last week; it is scheduled to lift off Nov. 9
with a satellite that reportedly will spy on Iraq.
   ``The next best thing to launching is passing the tanking
test,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.
   Sieck said NASA's image is bound to improve now that the entire
fleet is back in service. Discovery's flight earlier this month, in
fact, started what looks to be an upward trend, Crippen said.
   ``Launching space shuttles and reputation, they are tied
together,'' Sieck said. ``Safely and successfully carrying out
these missions, which is our goal, is only going to help the
reputation and our cause to keep the program going.''
   During Tuesday's three-hour test, Columbia's external tank was
filled with more than 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen to
pinpoint any more of the dangerous leaks that have kept the shuttle
grounded since May. A small amount of hydrogen escaped into the
engine compartment, but was well within allowable limits.
   It was NASA's most extensive fueling test of a shuttle. Ten TV
cameras and 17 sensors were mounted in Columbia's engine
compartment, the site of previous leakage.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has tried four
times to send Columbia on an astronomy mission. New fuel lines were
installed following the first attempt, but hydrogen later flooded
the engine compartment.
   Following the last launch attempt in mid-September, NASA formed
an engineering investigative team to find the remaining leaks. The
nine investigators, who worked seven days a week on the problem,
found a second crushed seal on a valve in Columbia's engine
compartment and instructed workers to tighten numerous joints.
   ``The results of all that work has paid off,'' Crippen said.
   Officials believe workers accidentally damaged components in
Columbia's engine compartment while searching for contamination
following the shuttle's last flight in January.
   ``I don't think the work was the problem. There was just a lot
of it,'' Crippen said. ``Any time you take your car down and do a
complete engine overhaul, sometimes when you put the thing back
together you might anticipate a few problems.''
   NASA does not plan to conduct any more fueling tests on
shuttles, Crippen said. The agency is working to improve prelaunch
checks of the shuttles' main propulsion system so problems can be
detected before fueling.
   The leaks on Columbia and Atlantis were not found until the
spaceships were fueled.
   ``I find in this business it goes ups and downs,'' Crippen said.
``We'll have other problems we've got to deal with. There's plenty
to work on at all times.''
   Crippen said Columbia could be launched in early December if
preparations go well and Atlantis goes up on time. NASA likes to
have at least three weeks between missions.
   NASA announced Tuesday that Atlantis is scheduled to lift off
sometime between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. EST on Nov. 9. The
precise time will not be announced until nine minutes before
liftoff because of the classified nature of the Defense Department
mission.

   A man crippled during a car accident was
sentenced Tuesday to 20 to 50 years in prison for sexually
assaulting an 18-year-old woman he held hostage for four days in
January.
   Archie Hill, 50, was convicted by a Cuyahoga County jury Monday
of 15 counts of rape, one count of kidnapping and one count of
assault.
   Prosecutors said Hill's live-in aide, Ray Lesure, 18, dated the
woman and lured her to Hill's home, where Hill beat her with an
extension cord.
   Lesure pleaded guilty last month to sexual battery and assault.
He will be sentenced Nov. 14.
   Hill, who has used a wheelchair since the accident 30 years ago,
and another live-in aide were convicted Sept. 13 of rape,
kidnapping and assault in the rape of a 31-year-old woman.
   Both men were sentenced to 90 to 225 years in prison.
   Judge Michael J. Corrigan ordered that Tuesday's sentence be
consecutive to the earlier sentence. Hill would be eligible for a
parole hearing after 15 years.

   The State Department raised the possibility
Tuesday of opening an office in Vietnam as part of the government's
effort to obtain an accounting for the nearly 1,700 missing
American servicemen in that country.
   The Vietnamese rejected the idea when it was proposed earlier
but the two sides have since agreed to an expansion of their
cooperation on the issue.
   Two weeks ago, during a visit by Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach, it was decided that a U.S. technical team would be sent to
Hanoi to work with Vietnamese military experts on improving
procedures for locating the remains of the missing Americans.
   The State Department said the U.S. team could stay there for an
indefinite period if the results justified such a presence.
   The U.S. government has never operated an office in Hanoi since
what was then North Vietnam became independent in 1954.

   An explosion believed caused
by a bomb caused extensive damage Tuesday night to central
Johannesburg but no injuries, police said.
   The blast occurred at 10:25 p.m. at an apartment block on the
corner of Jeppe and Troye streets downtown, said police Lt. Ida Van
Zwiel. Commercial explosives were believed to have been used in
Tuesday's blast, Van Zwiel said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Officers blocked
off the area, which was littered with glass.
   There have been a series of explosions in central Johannesburg
in recent months caused by bombs made of dynamite. Extreme
right-wing groups have claimed responsibility for some blasts.
Police blame most of the attacks on the right-wing groups, which
oppose President F.W. de Klerk's racial reforms.
   The most serious attack injured 27 people in July, when a bomb
went off near a black bus terminal downtown during morning rush
hour.

   Rain moved into the Northwest on Tuesday, with snow in the
mountains. Parts of Hawaii had heavy downpours.
   A strong cold front ushered rain and wind and lower temperatures
into the Northwest.
   Showers extended from Northern California and the northern
Pacific Coast to northern Idaho during the afternoon. The heaviest
rainfall total for the six hours up to 3 p.m. EST was 2.36 inches
at Crescent City, Calif., on the coast near the Oregon state line.
   Snow was expected across some of the higher elevations of the
Northwest, especially in the Cascades of Washington state.
   Heavy showers fell on the island of Hawaii during the night and
into Tuesday morning. More than 2.5 inches of rain fell at the Hilo
International Airport after midnight. Some places received more
than 4 inches of rain in 24 hours, the National Weather Service
reported.
   Gusty southerly wind prevailed from the southern high Plains to
the middle Mississippi Valley, and temperatures rose into the 70s
and lower 80s.
   But afternoon temperatures were only in the 40s and 50s across
the northern Atlantic Coast states and in the Pacific Northwest.
   Temperatures dipped below freezing early Tuesday from the Great

   Frenchmen returning from captivity in Iraq said
Tuesday they were free to move around in their ``prison without
bars,'' but that Americans were closely watched and not allowed to
mix with other detainees.
   Denis, a computer technician, said that at Baghdad's Rasheed
hotel, the Anericans``were watched over much more than us.''
   ``They were only allowed to go out two hours a day,'' he said.
``We couldn't count them or approach them. Plainclothes police
controlled everything.''
   Denis, 27, was one of 262 French citizens and 19 other
foreigners who flew back into Paris early Tuesday after their
release. He asked that his full name not be used.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said French
authorities will debrief the hostages held at strategic sites and
inform allied governments what they have to say about their
nationals held captive.
   Iraq has kept thousands of foreigners from leaving Iraq, and has
sent hundreds of Western men to strategic sites to deter an attack
by the U.S.-dominated military forces massed in the Persian Gulf
region.
   About 1,400 Britons and 1,000 Americans are believed to be held
in Iraq and Kuwait against their will.
   Two British women released with the French hostages said Tuesday
they had left behind 17 British men and two Americans at a Kuwaiti
oil refinery wired with explosives.
   ``We are concerned for the people left there,'' Wendy Major said
after arriving in London. ``The Iraqis have wired the refinery with
explosives ready to blow up the lot if they want.''
   Ms. Major, 31, was taken to the camp Aug. 18 after being caught
trying to escape to Saudi Arabia 16 days after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Saddam decided to release all French citizens last week in a
move seen as an attempt to divide the international alliance
against it.
   French officials said 38 French citizens chose to remain in
Kuwait or Iraq.
   ``Baghdad was a prison without bars,'' Denis said. ``It was a
part of my life I won't forget.''
   The freed hostages said the worst part was the isolation and
lack of news.
   ``Our guards were always courteous, but never gave us a bit of
information,'' said Marc, 25, who along with about 60 other
Frenchmen was shifted from one strategic site to another.
   ``One day we were near a chemical factory, another day at a
petroleum refinery,'' said Marc, who like most of the ex-hostages
refused to give his last name. ``Our only links to the outside were
the messages from our families on RFI (Radio France
Internationale).''
   Some of the former hostages came from Kuwait, where they had
eluded Iraqi soldiers for almost three months.
   Claude, 35, said he moved from house to house to avoid discovery
by Iraqi soldiers. ``We never set foot outside, for fear of being
arrested,'' he said.
   He moved about with five other Frenchmen, usually at night so
they wouldn't be caught.
   ``We lived in permanent anguish, without news, asking ourselves
what would happen to us the next day,'' he said.
   Iraqi soldiers caught up with Jacky Mongin, 40, on Aug. 19 at
the hotel in Kuwait where he worked. He was taken to a university
where he spent 10 weeks with seven Britons.
   ``Often we had nothing to eat but bread, rice and water,'' he
said. ``It was only in the last week that our guards brought us a
television and I found out I was going to be freed. Unfortunately
my companions stayed behind.''
   Gerard Vilate, of Nancy, a decorator and 20-year resident of
Kuwait, said: ``We didn't always get enough to eat, and I lost 10
kilos (22 pounds).''
   At least one Frenchman - a 23-year-old electrician named
Christophe - stayed behind as a gesture of solidarity with the
remaining hostages, his family said.
   ``We are still in shock but I'm not terribly surprised because
he was always outraged by injustice,'' his sister said.
   Christophe's family was told by the Foreign Ministry Monday that
he was staying ``because he believed the French should not leave
without the other hostages,'' his sister said.
   Denis, the computer worker, said the hostages hadn't suffered
from the global trade embargo against Iraq. His last dinner at the
Rasheed Hotel consisted of salmon, lobster and thick steak. ``I've
never seen such a feast,'' he said.

<HEAD>Amnesty Calls for Inquiry Into Namibian Torture Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Tuesday appealed for an
impartial inquiry into killings, torture and kidnappings during
Namibia's war of independence.
   The human rights group said it was at least the third time it
had asked for an investigation; it renewed the appeal because of
the Namibian government's Oct. 23 announcement it was appointing
Solomon Hawala as army chief.
   Hawala was accused of torturing and killing prisoners in SWAPO
base camps in Angola during the war, the Amnesty statement said.
   ``At the very least, the government should ensure that those
responsible for past human rights abuses are not placed in
positions where they could have control or authority over
prisoners,'' the organization said.
   Namibia became independent March 21, after 75 years of South
African rule. SWAPO, a mainly black nationalist movement that waged
a 23-year bush war, won a plurality of the vote in a
U.N.-supervised election in November 1989.
   ``Both sides in the conflict - the South African security forces
and the South West African People's Organization - were responsible
for such abuses before Namibia became independent earlier this
year,'' the rights organization said.
   ``At least 350 people imprisoned by SWAPO in Angola are still
unaccounted for,'' Amnesty said.
   Around 60 people were reported missing while in the custody of
the South African security forces, ``but this is just the tip of
the iceberg,'' said an Amnesty spokeswoman, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   In June this year the SWAPO-dominated Namibian government set up
an all-party parliamentary committee to study rights abuses.
   But the committee ``is not known to have considered the matter
in detail,'' Amnesty said.
   Some prisoners freed from SWAPO bases in Angola said hundreds of
SWAPO members were accused of being South African spies and many
were tortured until they signed confessions.
   SWAPO leaders have confirmed incidents of torture, but they
blame many of the abuses during the war on a since-disbanded, South
Africa-linked paramilitary unit known as Koevoet, the Afrikaans
word for ``crowbar.''

<HEAD>Iran Hangs 41 Alleged Drug Smugglers, Bandits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran hanged 41 alleged drug smugglers and
bandits Tuesday, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The state news agency, monitored in Nicosia, said three Afghans
were among 19 alleged drug smugglers hanged in northeastern
Khorasan province, which borders Afghanistan.
   Twenty-two other bandits were hanged in southeastern
Sistan-Baluchestan province, which adjoins Khorasan.
   The alleged drug traffickers were convicted of smuggling a total
of about 2,645 pounds of opium, 46 pounds of heroin, and 15 pounds
of hashish, the agency said.
   It added the bandits, hanged in Zabol, capital of
Sistan-Baluchestan province, were convicted of armed robbery, drug
smuggling and kidnapping.
   Iran has hanged more than 1,500 people, most of them on alleged
drug trafficking charges and imprisoned over 50,000 so-called drug
addicts since December 1988.
   Iranian opposition groups and other independent human rights
organizations maintain the killings are a cover for liquidating
government opponents.
   Other observers believe Iran would have few qualms about
admitting it was liquidating its opponents. In the past, Iran's
state-run media have reported executions of spies and other
opponents.
   Iran's draconian laws call for a mandatory death sentence for
possession of even small quantities of drugs.
   According to official figures, some 1 million Iranians are
involved in drug abuse. But other independent sources say addicts
number twice that figure.
   United Nations envoy, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, who visited Iran
earlier this month to investigate rights abuses there, said he was
satisfied with Iranian due process.
   Iranian judicial officials have constantly called on judges
nationwide to expedite cases as soon as possible, and to pass the
stiffest possible sentences.

<HEAD>Another Shooting Hits Sheriff's Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunshots riddled a campaign office of Cook County
sheriff candidate Michael Sheahan early Tuesday in the latest round
of violence to mar the campaign, police said.
   About five shots hit the front door and window of an unoccupied
Sheahan campaign office on the southwest side, said Chicago police
officer Maureen McKeever.
   A witness reported seeing a car speed away from the office after
the shooting, police said.
   Sheahan, a Democrat, is running against Republican incumbent
James O'Grady and Washington Party candidate Tommy Brewer.
   A week ago, a Sheahan campaign worker was shot three times in
what police say was a politically motivated attack.
   Sheahan says the victim, 34-year-old Irving Bell, was hanging
signs for him when the shooting occurred. But O'Grady says Bell was
tearing down O'Grady signs.
   A Chicago man has been charged with attempted murder in that
incident. And two other men - including a Cook County correctional
officer - have been charged with mob action.
   Bell remained in serious condition Tuesday at Christ Hospital in
suburban Oak Lawn. In addition, Sheahan and O'Grady have accused
each other's campaign workers of vandalizing signs and offices.
Third-party candidate Brewer says the violence proves that neither
of his opponents is fit to hold the sheriff's office.

<HEAD>Major Parties Concerned About Status</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Connecticut Party candidate Lowell P.
Weicker Jr. is ahead in the polls, prompting concern that Democrats
could lose their status as a major party in state politics.
   A little-known state law stipulates that, to qualify as a major
party, with the ability to get state financing for primary
elections, they must get at least 20 percent of the vote in each
gubernatorial election.
   This year, public opinion polls have consistently shown the
Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Bruce A. Morrison, enjoying the
support of less than 20 percent of the electorate. A poll last week
had him at 12 percent.
   The Republican, John G. Rowland, has been in the 24-34 percent
range.
   Support for Weicker, a former Republican U.S. senator who
created the Connecticut Party for his independent bid for governor,
has fluctuated between the 30s and 40s, the higher numbers coming
in early polls.
   State GOP Chairman Richard Foley would love to see the Democrats
embarrassed this year, but says he's found that ``Democrats always
come home. In most cases, it's easier to change a Democrat's
religion than his party affiliation.''
   State Democratic Chairman John F. Droney Jr. said the 20 percent
law ``should be a wake-up call to Democrats who, for whatever
reasons, have been toying with ... voting for one of the two
Republicans.''
   But, Droney said, ``there's as much chance of Bruce Morrison
falling below 20 percent as Lowell Weicker getting a reputation as
a man of principle and character. I just don't see it.''
   If Weicker does win, that means the Connecticut Party will be
listed at the top of the ballot in 1994.

<HEAD>High Court Hears Case That Could Force Millions In State Tax
Refunds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday in a
tax case that could force Georgia to refund more than $30 million
collected from out-out-state distillers under a levy later struck
down as unconstitutional.
   The case has drawn wide attention from state and local officials
nationwide because it addresses when states may be required to
refund taxes collected under laws later invalidated by court
rulings.
   Thirty-one states, national organizations representing
governors, cities, counties, state legislatures and mayors, have
intervened in support of Georgia's position.
   ``Cases such as the one now before this court will have a major
fiscal effect on the states,'' Virginia Attorney General Mary Sue
Terry argued in a statement filed in behalf of 16 states.
   ``This court's decisions will affect transfers of public funds,
running into the billions of dollars,'' she said. ``And the
practical result of such redistributions will be felt primarily by
the taxpayers and citizens who are the beneficiaries of state
services.''
   Morton Siegel, a lawyer for Jim Beam Distilling Co., told the
justices the company was denied a $2.4 million tax refund by
Georgia even though the state Supreme Court ruled that the law
under which the taxes were collected in 1982, 1983 and 1983 was
unconstitutional.
   The law levied excise taxes on alcoholic beverages imported into
Georgia at twice the rate of those manufactured in state. It was
amended by the legislature in 1985 after the Supreme Court struck
down a similar scheme in Hawaii as an unconstitutional infringement
on interstate commerce.
   Jim Beam sued Georgia and a state judge ruled Georgia's law
unconstitutional. But the judge refused to grant a refund, despite
a state law requiring refunds of ``any and all'' taxes illegally
assessed or collected.
   Two other distillers have since filed identical suits seeking a
total of $28 million in refunds.
   Assistant Georgia Attorney General Amelia Baker argued that the
distillers are not entitled to refunds because the state collected
the taxes under a longstanding law which the state had ``no reason
to believe would be invalidated'' before the Hawaii case.
   She also said requiring Georgia to refund $30 million would
``create a severe financial burden'' and would force cuts in other
valid government programs.

<HEAD>Pickering: Seizure of Assets May be Next U.N. Step Against Iraq</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering says
the Security Council might order the seizure of Iraq's frozen
assets in its next attempt to force Baghdad from Kuwait.
   Pickering, who on Thursday takes over the council as chairman,
also pledges that Washington will take any steps necessary to
protect U.S. citizens. Pickering argued for the American right to
protect its citizens overseas nearly a year ago, when he defended
the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   As President Bush dispatches 100,000 more troops to the Persian
Gulf, Pickering will have a golden opportunity to push the U.S.
diplomatic agenda in the Security Council.
   Pickering becomes chairman of the council for the month of
November under the alphabetic rotation the body uses to determine
its leader.
   In December, the ambassador of Yemen, the only Arab council
member and the most overtly pro-Iraqi delegate, takes over.
   ``You can see that there will be action in the next few weeks,
or not for a long time,'' a Western diplomat said Tuesday, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the Security Council has
slapped a trade embargo on Iraq and occupied Kuwait, extended it to
include air cargo service and given permission to naval powers in
the gulf to halt shipping suspected of violating the embargo.
   On Monday, the Security Council voted to hold Iraq liable for
human rights abuses and damages during its occupation of Kuwait,
and it warned of unspecified further action if Iraq defies the
council.
   Pickering delivered a warning of possible independent U.S.
action, saying: ``It is the solemn duty of every state to protect
its citizens. ...
   ```I want to underscore one point. ... The United States will do
that which is necessary to meet its obligation to its own
citizens.''
   When the United States invaded Panama to oust Gen. Manuel
Noriega, Pickering used self-defense as one factor to support the
intervention.
   Several U.S. citizens had been menaced and attacked in the weeks
before the December 1989 invasion, and one was killed at a
roadblock by guards.
   Pickering said the U.N. charter allowed nations the right of
individual or collective self-defense, and said a country could use
military force against another to protect its nationals.
   Pickering also indicated the United Nations might try to seize
Iraqi assets. ``Iraq is liable for full restitution or compensation
for the losses and damages it has caused by its illegal invasion
and occupation of Kuwait.
   ``We anticipate the council will address this question more
fully in the days ahead,'' he said.
   Iraq's $4 billion in overseas assets, of which about $800
million is in the United States, would not go far in offsetting the
losses other countries have suffered.
   Jordan alone estimates its economic losses because of the
invasion and embargo at $2 billion.
   The frozen assets would help rebuild Kuwait if its government
ever is restored after an Iraqi withdrawal.
   Monday's resolution also invited nations to compile lists of war
crimes committed by the Iraqis against Kuwaitis and other
foreigners.
   The council has been acting under Chapter 7 of the charter,
which provides for Security Council sanctions and eventually
collective military action against member states that threaten
international peace and security.
   The council has not yet exhausted its non-military provisions,
which include interruption of economic relations and of rail, sea,
air and communications links.
   Article 42, the next step envisioned by some members, calls for
``such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary to
maintain or restore international peace and security, (including)
demonstrations, blockade and other operations by air, sea or land
forces of members of the United Nations.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Training Devices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that
trainers of Tennessee Walking Horses may use lightweight
arrangements of chains and rollers to produce the characteristic
high-stepping gait of the breed.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia unanimously upheld the Agriculture
Department's regulations permitting the use of the chains, called
``action devices,'' if the assembly weighs six ounces or less. The
devices had been the object of a lawsuit by an animal protection
group.
   In June, the American Horse Protection Association obtained a
lower court ruling that the department's regulations allowing the
lightweight chains and rollers had been adopted in an arbitrary
manner.
   The group contended that the action devices encourage trainers
to use illegal chemicals that cause the horses to develop sores on
the back of the foreleg.
   It argued that the devices, used in conjunction with chemicals,
would cause pain that encourages the horses to walk in the
characteristic high-stepping gait of the Tennessee Walking Horse.
   But the department countered that 99 percent of horses examined
by its veterinarians did not exhibit sores even though they wore
the six-ounce bracelet-like assembly which the horse, trainers say,
tries to ``step out of.''
   The appeals court held that the agriculture secretary ``was not
under an express duty to prohibit any practice, however safe by
itself, that might indirectly cause or perpetuate abuses already
separately prohibited by the regulations.''
   ``If such were the duty, the secretary might have to eliminate
horse show rings entirely because they perpetuate the practice of
soring,'' the court said in an opinion by Circuit Judge Abner
Mikva.
   The ruling overturned an opinion by U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch, who had set aside the regulations allowing six-ounce action
devices. Gasch had ordered the department to consider banning them
altogether.
   Gasch's order had been stayed pending the government's appeal.
   Mikva was joined in the ruling by Circuit Judges Harry Edwards
and Laurence Silberman.

   Saddam Hussein said Tuesday that Iraq was making final
preparations for war and expected an attack within days by the
United States and its allies. A U.S. senator said President Bush's
``patience is wearing thin.''
   In the Persian Gulf, 10 American sailors died when a steam pipe
ruptured in the boiler room of the USS Iwo Jima. And in Saudi
Arabia, a Marine was killed in an accident while driving in the
desert.
   Bush discussed possible military action against Iraq in a
meeting with congressional leaders on the gulf crisis, but he told
them he could not guarantee he would consult them before embarking
on hostilities. He refused to comment publicly on a report the
United States plans to discuss a timetable with U.S. allies for a
military offensive.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Saturday will begin a
weeklong visit to Arab and European countries to consult on future
steps in the gulf, officials said. The visit will include a meeting
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Asked about the potential for a U.S. military strike, White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``s these things unfold, of
course, there are always scenarios for action that have to be
considered ... but there is no timetable for action.''
   Fitzwater sought to dampen fears that fighting was imminent.
``The attitude at the meeting was ``play it down - be calm,'' he
said.
   The United States has more than 200,000 troops in the gulf
region and has announced plans to send at least 100,000 more. It is
the largest U.S. military deployment since the Vietnam War.
   Saddam summoned his military commanders to a meeting in Baghdad
to complete ``preparations for urban warfare and necessary measures
to be taken in the event of combat in (Kuwait),'' the Iraqi News
Agency reported.
   ``We must be prepared with all that God has given us of
potential to thwart perfidious intentions by the United States and
its allies to launch an attack in the next few days,'' the report
quoted Saddam as saying.
   The agency did not explain why Saddam believed an attack was
imminent.
   While he talked of possible hostilities, his foreign minister,
Tariq Aziz, struck a more cautious note. Aziz told the Iraqi News
Agency that Iraq is prepared to talk with ``any Arab or
international party'' provided it is not ``prompted by premeditated
hostile designs.''
   There was some speculation that Saddam's warning may be a
propaganda ploy by Iraq to drive a wedge between the United States
and those of its allies who seek to avoid hostilities.
   Diplomats in the Middle East, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saddam was reacting to statements Monday by Baker.
   Baker told a gathering in Los Angeles: ``Let no one doubt: We
will not rule out a possible use of force if Iraq continues to
occupy Kuwait.''
   Congressional leaders emerging from their meeting with Bush said
they had urged the president to explore all other avenues for
resolving the crisis and got no indication that U.S. military
action was imminent.
   ``His patience is wearing thin,'' said Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine, one of several lawmakers who met for an hour at the White
House with the president. But Cohen added: ``For the time being,
he's going to continue to pursue the course that we're currently
on.''
   Participants described Bush as highly disturbed by reports of
atrocities in occupied Kuwait and the plight of U.S. Embassy
personnel and other Americans who have been blocked from leaving.
   Before the meeting, Bush declined to comment on a newspaper
report that administration officials would discusss a timetable
with U.S. allies for a possible military offensive.
   The Los Angeles Times, quoting an unidentified senior government
official, said he considers war almost inevitable and considers a
strike most likely in December or January. The report said the
United States now believes sanctions will not force Iraq to pull
out of the emirate it invaded Aug. 2.
   The accident aboard the Iwo Jima came as it was sailing out of
Bahrain to take part in military exercises. Cmdr. Mark Neuhart of
the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said the cause of the leak
aboard the amphibious assault ship was under investigation.
   Two injured sailors who had been in critical condition died
later Tuesday, the Pentagon in Washington said. The ship returned
to Bahrain for repairs, Neuhart said.
   The Iwo Jima was to be part of a 10-day exercise that began
Tuesday. A Pentagon source said it would feature a landing of more
than 10,000 Marines on a beach in Oman.
   Bob Hall, a Pentagon spokesman, called the maneuver a ``routine
amphibious training excercise.'' He declined to provide specifics
on the number of Marines and ships involved.
   In a separate accident, one Marine was killed and three others
were injured when the vehicle they were traveling in overturned in
the Saudi desert, the U.S. military Joint Information Bureau said
in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
   In addition to the deaths Tuesday, 32 U.S. servicemen have been
killed since Operation Desert Shield began in August.
   In other developments Tuesday:
   -Two freed British hostages said two Americans and 17 Britons
were being held as human shields at a Kuwait oil refinery that the
Iraqis have wired with explosives. They are among hundreds of
foreigners held by the Iraqis at strategic sites to deter attack.
   -An Iraqi dissident group reported that Iraq has moved essential
machinery and equipment from its arms production and chemical
weapons plants to new, secret locations as a precaution against
possible air attack. The report by the London-based Kurdistan
Democratic Party could not be independently confirmed.

<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Gro Harlem Brundtland
agreed Tuesday to form her third government since 1981, replacing a
center-right coalition that split over talks with the European
Community.
   ``We have concluded that it is possible to assume the task of
ruling,'' said Ms. Brundtland, after telling Crown Prince Harald,
Norway's acting monarch, that her party was willing to form a
minority government.
   Jo Benkow, president of Parliament, polled the national
assembly's six parties, then advised Harald that the majority
favored Ms. Brundtland to succeed the Conservative-led coalition
that forced her from office a year ago.
   Ms. Brundtland would not say when the new government would take
over, but news reports said it would be ready by Friday.
   ``We are the biggest party in Parliament and will follow the
same line we have in the past, which is in keeping with our
political philosophy,'' said Ms. Brundtland.
   She met with opposition leaders through the afternoon on seven
key issues including the environment, child care, economic policy
and the distribution of wealth according to socialist tradition.
   Labor has only 67 seats in the 165-seat Parliament, but Ms.
Brundtland said there was sufficient support from other parties to
let her govern.
   Ms. Brundtland was asked to lead the country because a
three-party coalition led by Conservative Prime Minister Jan P.
Syse resigned Monday.
   The coalition split over what policy to pursue in negotiations
between the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade
Association about forming a joint 18-nation trade bloc after 1992.
   The Center Party, backed by the country's subsidized farmers,
had refused to remain in a coalition or support a Conservative
single-party government because of Syse's support for the EC.
   Norway is a member of the European Free Trade Association, but
the Conservatives want to eventually join the EC.
   Center refused changes demanded by the EC in Norwegian laws
protecting domestic resources and industry. Syse resigned and said
he could not lead a government that was divided on important
international negotiations.
   Ms. Brundtland also supports a strong agreement with the
Community, but said Center was free to pursue its own
anti-membership efforts.
   One newspaper described Ms. Brundtland's return to office as
calling ``Mother Gro to Clean Up'' in the difficult political
situation. Parliament is nearly deadlocked and there is no
constitutional provision for calling elections for three more
years.
   Ms. Brundtland, a 51-year-old physician, Harvard-educated public
health specialist and grandmother, is known as a tough, veteran
politician. She became Norway's youngest and first woman prime
minister in 1981, in a term that lasted seven months.
   She also led the government from May 1986 until Syse's coalition
forced her to resign in October 1989.
   Ms. Brundtland is best-known abroad as a champion of the
environment. She headed the U.N. commission that published ``Our
Common Future,'' a 1987 textbook of environmental concerns.
   Labor's first test may come in dealing with a 1991 national
budget, including tax reductions for higher income families, which
the former coalition parties drafted and still favor.
   ``That cannot be the starting point for our government,'' said
Brundtland about the budget proposals.
   Center, Parliament's smallest party, thwarted Syse's attempt to
form a single-party Conservative government by declaring its
preference for Ms. Brundtland.
   After the Sept. 11, 1989 national election, the Conservative-led
bloc controlled 84 seats and the socialists had 81 seats in
parliament.
   Center's 11 votes now swing the parliamentary balance in favor
of the Labor-led socialists.

   Opposition presidential candidate
Laurent Gbagbo said Tuesday he will ask the Supreme Court to
overturn election results he says were rigged by President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny.
   The Interior Ministry announced that Ivory Coast's leader of 30
years won Sunday's balloting with 81.67 percent of votes in the
country's first contested presidential election.
   Gbagbo was the sole challenger. The election marked the first
time a leader of one of Africa's one-party states faced opposition
at the polls since a wave of protests and rioting for democracy
began sweeping sub-Saharan Africa this year.
   Gbagbo told reporters that lawyer Emile Boga, a leading member
of his Popular Front, was preparing papers to present to the
Supreme Court. Election results remain unofficial until they are
declared by the court, an announcement expected next week. The
court, appointed by Houphouet-Boigny, also hears appeals about
elections.
   Boga said about 100 opposition party members had been arrested
since Sunday, when Gbagbo's supporters smashed dozens of ballot
boxes to halt the elections at numerous voting stations. They
charged the boxes were stuffed with votes for Houphouet-Boigny.
   The lawyer said the detainees were being held at an army camp,
and that some of them were being beaten and ill-treated.
   Gbagbo has charged massive fraud in elections he called ``a
masquerade'' of democracy. Houphouet-Boigny was expected to win,
but not by so large a margin.
   Interior Minister Leon Konan Koffi said the charges were
slanderous lies. He said the opposition tried to stop elections
because they knew they could not win.
   In a personal attack on Gbagbo published Tuesday by the
government-controlled daily newspaper, Konan Koffi said the
opposition leader wanted power so that he could live in luxury.
   He described Gbagbo's supporters as ``a band of fanatics,'' and
accused the opposition leader of leading astray young Ivorians
perturbed by the country's economic crisis.
   The crisis was brought on over-spending and slumping prices for
cocoa and coffee, the main export earners.

   President Bush on Tuesday launched a
blistering partisan attack on ``arrogant'' Democrats in a maneuver
designed to rally Republican forces for next week's midterm
elections.
   Addressing a group of GOP workers, Bush alternately portrayed
Democrats as clumsy, bumbling, uncaring toward the nation's
children, ``unresponsive and irresponsible,'' and ``an arrogant
majority.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said the country needs a
leader who ``acts like a president, rather than a president who
acts like a party chairman.''
   ``When he talks about giving Americans a better deal, let's be
clear about what he really means. A better deal for the rich, a raw
deal for the elderly and a raw deal for the middle class,'' said
Gephardt.
   Gephardt said Bush seeks to take ``this misleading message to
the campaign trail to elect a Republican Congress, something which
working families and elderly Americans should deeply fear.''
   Bush began the day on a bipartisan note, briefing both
Democratic and Republican leaders on his Persian Gulf strategy at a
morning session at the White House. But by the afternoon, he was
again beating political drums.
   ``There are two things you should never watch being made,
sausage and laws,'' Bush said, repeating an old saw. ``As for the
Democrats in Congress, this year we've all been taken on a
first-class tour of the hot dog factory.''
   Standing on a stage with a majority of his Cabinet behind him,
Bush told about 500 party workers at a hotel rally assembled by the
Republican National Committee: ``Their rhetoric is wrong and their
purpose is wrong and we're not going to let them get away with
it.''
   The crowd included party workers from the national committee and
from congressional GOP committees, whom Bush termed ``the faithful,
those who are standing there getting the job done day in and day
out.''
   One party worker conspicuously absent was Ed Rollins,
co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee, whom the White House has been trying - so far
unsuccessfully - to have fired.
   Rollins' memo to House Republicans saying it was OK to distance
themselves from the president on tax issues raised the president's
ire.
   Gary Koops, a spokesman for the GOP congressional committee,
said Rollins was too busy analyzing new campaign polling data to
attend.
   Bush's scalding campaign speech was in keeping with the highly
partisan tone he set on his just-concluded four-day campaign swing
to the West.
   Bush was to attend a rally for a GOP congressional candidate in
the Washington suburbs Wednesday, then begin a cross-country trek
Thursday that will keep him on the campaign trail through Election
Day.
   The president called Democrats ``an arrogant majority that uses
its power to protect its own prerogatives, its own privileges, its
own pet projects. And it is time that American people say, enough
is enough. No more.''
   He accused them of a ``distortion of Republican motives, goals
and accomplishments,'' and of a ``clumsy explanation'' of their
proposal to delay tax indexing for one year.
   Bush apologized anew for supporting a deficit-reduction package
containing some $140 billion in new taxes over the year, again
sounding the theme that he was forced into it by Democrats.
   ``There was a ransom, and that ransom was taxes,'' he said.
   But he said he reluctantly agreed to the plan because ``I just
simply could not bring myself to leave America's children an
avalanche of unpaid bills.''
   After condemning the fact that the Democrats forced him into
accepting the new taxes part of the plan, Bush said the overall
$492 billion deficit-cutting package was ``long overdue and, in my
view, it is essential.''

<HEAD>Parliament Pressures Former Communists Over its Assets</HEAD>

   Parliament deputies on Tuesday sharply criticized
the leaders of the former East German Communist Party amid reports
they pilfered state property and sent money abroad before ceding
power.
   A former secret police officer said late Monday that the party's
holdings may b worth up to $40 billion. They include such
properties as a hotel on the island of Korfu bought from Greek
communists, said the former official, Juergen Perdus.
   In Parliament, Social Democratic leader Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier
on Tuesday charged the former communists, now called the Party of
Democratic Socialism, had taken the ``material worth of the old
communist state without accepting responsibility for 40 years of
injustice and a ruined economy.''
   Gregor Gysi, leader of the reformed Communists, promised he
would clear up questions about the party's assets, which he has
said were worth about $1.3 billion.
   Party leaders have promised to open the party's accounts and
hand over everything to a public trustee, except what they need to
meet obligations and continue political activities.
   With the first all-German elections due on Dec. 2, the scandal
is expected to hurt the party at the polls.
   In Communist East Germany, most property was owned by the state.
Although these businesses are supposed to have been turned over to
a board of trustees, the Communists are reported to have spent
their last days in power hiding or transferring wealth.
   Two party officials, Wolfgang Langnitzschke and Wolfgang Pohl,
have been arrested on charges they illegally transferred $72
million to accounts in Moscow.

   An abandoned well where death
squads dumped their victims was discovered in a slum called
Shangri-la, a police official said Tuesday.
   An official with a special commission that investigates death
squad activities said the grave was found Saturday, after police
arrested six suspected killers. The official asked not to be named
for security reasons.
   He said no bodies had yet been retrieved from the site on the
outskirts of Nova Iguacu, a city about 20 miles outside of Rio. It
isn't clear how many victims were left there, the official said.
   Press reports said there were about 100 bodies buried in the
grave. Eduardo Gomes, a church worker in the region, confirmed the
press account.
   ``Most are almost certainly teenagers, killed by death squads,''
he said in a phone interview, in which he said that clothing and
shoes uncovered from the grave indicated most of the corpses were
those of youngsters.
   But the special commission official denied any of the victims
had been exhumed, and suggested the reports were exaggerated.
   ``It's all speculation,'' he said.
   The death squads consist largely of active and off-duty police
officers who make extra money by killing petty thieves at the
behest of shopkeepers and others. Many of the victims are poor
minors involved in the drug trade and small-scale theft.
   Death squads operate in many areas of Rio but are notorious for
their activities in Nova Iguacu and other cities of the Baixada
Fluminense, a sprawling lowlands area west of Rio.
   The AP late Tuesday visited Rio's 54th precinct, which normally
handles investigations in the area where the grave was found.
Police Chief Celso Bezerra said the case was being handled by the
special commission and he could not provide details.
   Bezerra did confirm the area where the grave is located had been
used as a dump by death squads. But he expressed skepticism that
large numbers of bodies would be uncovered.
   The AP also went to the Shangri-La neighborhood, an impoverished
area criss-crossed by dirt roads dotted with small bare brick
homes. No one could be found who was eager to talk about
clandestine graveyards.
   Homicide investigator Walter Codong dos Reis said the grave was
in an extremely dangerous area. He said he would only send
detectives there if they were armed with machine guns.
   Residents of areas where death squads operate rarely speak to
police, or outsiders, for fear of retribution, Codong dos Reis
said.

   In a novel combination, government researchers
and a major health insurer are sponsoring experiments to test the
effectiveness of bone marrow transplants as a treatment for breast
cancer.
   The clinical trials will try to determine whether the
complicated procedure offers hope for women with early-stage breast
cancer who are at high risk for recurrence and women in advanced
stages of the disease.
   ``We want to help women with breast cancer, but these therapies
are very toxic, very expensive and very difficult, and you don't
want to expose women to these therapies unless you're confident
there's a good chance you'll help them,'' Dr. Michael Friedman,
director of cancer therapy evaluation at the National Cancer
Institute, said Tuesday.
   The procedure, called autologous bone marrow transplantation, is
considered effective treatment for certain forms of leukemia and
lymphoma and some other diseases, and health insurers usually cover
it in these cases.
   But most health insurers, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield
plans, don't cover the procedure for women with breast cancer
because they consider it experimental treatment that has not been
shown to be effective.
   Yet, some physicians are recommending it and some patients have
taken their insurance companies to court to force them to cover the
procedure, which can cost from $75,000 to $150,000.
   ``Many of our plans have had to debate the issue in court, which
we do not believe is the appropriate setting for medical
policy-making,'' said Douglas Peters, senior vice president of the
Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, the nation's largest
private health insurer.
   ``By funding some of the clinical care costs associated with the
NCI trials, we're able to provide access to this treatment while
contributing to the search for a definitive answer to the question
of whether or not it works,'' he said.
   At least 15 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are expected to
participate in helping to finance the clinical trials by providing
funds for care of patients. It marks the first time a health
insurer has joined the government in sponsoring medical
experiments.
   In an autologous bone marrow transplant, some of a patient's
bone marrow is removed and stored while they undergo high doses of
chemotherapy to kill their cancer. After chemotherapy, their stored
bone marrow is put back in.
   The bone marrow is the source of blood cells, both the
oxygen-carrying red cells and important cells of the immune system
that fights foreign bodies. Storing marrow shields it from the
toxic effects of the chemotherapy, enabling the marrow to recover
its function when the stored marrow is returned to the body.
   About 1,200 women are expected to participate in the trials,
which are expected to last two to four years.
   Half of the women in the trials will be given conventional
treatment and the other half will be given bone marrow transplants,
Friedman said.
   Aside from whether the transplant is effective, ``this may teach
us some very valuable things,'' Friedman said.
   ``We're going to be confronted in the future with new, complex,
expensive technologies,'' he said. ``If we learn how to evaluate
this particular situation, it may have implications as to how we
face other scientific and economic problems.''

<HEAD>Vander Jagt Has Challenger For House GOP Campaign Group Chair</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Don Sundquist, a savvy four-term
Republican from Tennessee, is challenging veteran Michigan Rep. Guy
Vander Jagt for the chairmanship of the House GOP campaign
organization, sources said Tuesday.
   Sundquist began making a flurry of telephone calls and personal
contacts in the final hours before Congress adjourned this weekend
to amass support for his bid to unseat Vander Jagt, who has what
many see as a lackluster record in the post.
   But Sundquist's challenge also appeared to be exacerbating
splits among House Republicans, who are deeply divided over how
best to conduct themselves as the minority party in the chamber.
   One Republican staff source, speaking only on condition of
anonymity, said the challenge is opposed by Rep. Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, the No. 2 GOP leader in the House. Gingrich views
Sundquist's bid just a week before the Nov. 6 elections as a
damaging distraction to the campaign arm, the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
   ``There will be plenty of time after Nov. 6 for whatever
fighting there's going to be,'' the aide said. ``If they do this
now, we may lose our focus'' before Election Day.
   Sundquist spokesman Ralph Perrey acknowledged that his boss had
discussed running against Vander Jagt with colleagues, but added he
would make no formal announcement until after the elections.
   ``Mr. Sundquist has a background as a manager of campaigns, a
grassroots organizer and one who can recruit and develop
candidates,'' Perrey said. ``Many believe those are precisely the
skills needed'' at the NRCC now.
   Sundquist managed former Sen. Howard Baker's unsuccessful
presidential campaign in 1979 and 1980, he said. ``A significant
number of people are urging him'' to get into the race, he added.
   Another senior Republican House source said Gingrich and his
ally Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., already are heavily involved in the
operations of the NRCC, which provides campaign cash, advice and
technology to Republican candidates.
   Two sources suggested that Vander Jagt may be considering
stepping down from the post which he has held for 15 years.
Republicans have failed to make substantial gains in the House
during that time, and have been slipping in recent years. There has
not been a GOP majority in the House since the 1950s, and that is a
source of tension for the party.
   If Vander Jagt does so, Weber may consider running against
Sundquist for the campaign post, one source said.

   Boiler rooms that power the USS Iwo Jima and
other Navy ships are potentially hazardous workplaces, but no more
so than the factory floor of a foundry or a steel mill, an engineer
said Tuesday.
   A boiler pipe ruptured Tuesday aboard the amphibious assault
ship Iwo Jima, releasing super-heated steam that killed 10 sailors
in the worst Navy accident during the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The steam plant, like any other mature technology, is
dangerous for the operator,'' said A. Sydney Roberts, a professor
of mechanical engineering at Old Dominion University.
   ``It's a common industrial hazard,'' he said. ``An industrial
workplace is not safe in relative terms.''
   Lt. Gordon Hume, a spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk,
agreed that ``any time you are working around high temperatures and
high pressures, you want to be very careful.''
   Hume said the Iwo Jima would have been operating with steam
temperatures of more than 800 degrees and pressure higher than 600
pounds per square inch.
   Hume, who is trained in engineering, said the Navy uses three
basic methods to power its ships: steam, diesel and gas turbine.
   Diesel engines are used on the smallest naval vessels and many
destroyers and cruisers are being built with gas turbine power
plants much like jet engines, Hume said.
   Larger ships use steam. In the Iwo Jima, water is heated in two
boilers to make the steam, which is piped through a turbine that
turns the propeller.
   ``We certainly train our people extensively to combat the
potential dangers of steam,'' Hume said.
   Because older technologies such as steam are well understood,
the plants can be designed with safety in mind. But all the design
in the world cannot protect the worker from human error or faulty
equipment, Roberts said.
   ``With high temperatures and high pressures you have lots of
problems, Roberts said. ``Seals can fail, bolts can fail. Several
years ago at the nuclear power plant in Surry, they had a pipe
fail.''
   In December 1986, steam eroded and ruptured a section of an
elbow joint at the plant, killing four workers. The accident
occurred outside the plant's nuclear reactor and no radiation was
released.
   ``You face many of the same hazards if you work on the floor of
the foundry or at a steel mill,'' Roberts said.

<TEXT>
   The military is expanding its role in the drug war
despite the drain of the Persian Gulf buildup and $500 billion in
federal budget cuts, top interdiction officials said Tuesday.
   Army, Navy, and Coast Guard officers working with civilian
agencies to stop drugs at borders said their effort has forced
smugglers to change routes and methods.
   Smugglers are shifting operations away from sea routes through
the Caribbean to overland routes through Mexico, said Customs
Service Commissioner Carol Hallett, who heads the joint Border
Interdiction Committee.
   ``We certainly believe that we have the drug traffickers on the
run,'' she said. ``We know that we have made it more difficult for
them to operate. We've made it more dangerous and certainly we've
made it more expensive.''
   A massive deficit-cutting bill aimed at reducing government
spending by $500 billion over the next five years has left
drug-fighting agencies untouched, Ms. Hallett said.
   The U.S. deployment to Saudi Arabia hasn't prevented the
military from increasing its profile in the drug war, said Maj.
Gen. Arnold Schlossberg Jr.
   ``The Department of Defense has a lot of assets, and in spite of
the fact we're in Desert Shield, we've enhanced our operations here
in this area and in the Eastern Pacific,'' he said.
   For example, the Navy sharply increased the number of ``aircraft
days'' dedicated to spotting drug traffickers in the Atlantic and
Caribbean region from 600 in September 1989 to 3,000 last month,
said Rear Adm. Robert Spane.
   The amount of drugs seized in the Customs Service's southeast
region, which includes Florida, was up this year by about 7 tons
from last year - to 77,000 pounds as the interdiction effort goes
farther into the Caribbean, Ms. Hallett said.
   The agency's southeast region also includes Georgia, the
Carolinas, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
   Although the region including Florida continues to account for
about half the nation's drug seizures, the joint interdiction
effort helped force about 70 percent of drug trafficking onto
overland Mexican routes, Ms. Hallett said.
   The Colombian drug cartels continue to operate, but the
crackdown in that nation has shifted some coca-growing operations
to Bolivia and other nations, others on the interdiction committee
said.
   Schlossberg cautioned that none of the interdiction officials
believe they have a ``silver bullet'' that will stop drug
smuggling.
   The interdiction program is only one part of a larger drug
strategy.
   ``Our job is to keep the pressure on'' until programs aimed at
decreasing drug demand can take effect, said Rear Adm. Robert
Kramek, commander of the Coast Guard's seventh district.

   Assailants shot to death an
elderly tourist and injured his wife Tuesday after the couple
apparently became lost while driving and ended up in the black
township of Soweto, police said.
   Police Lt. Col. Tienie Halgryn said the couple were visiting
from New Zealand and came under fire while driving through Soweto
on Tuesday afternoon.
   The couple's daughter, who lives in Johannesburg, said her
parents had taken her car to go shopping and got lost. ``They had
apparently taken a wrong turnoff, and when they saw a sign saying
`Welcome to Soweto' they realized they were lost,'' the daughter,
Georgie Braithwaite, told the South African Press Association.
   Someone shot at the car, hitting the woman in the arm and the
man in the stomach, Halgryn said. The man, 74-year-old Alfred
Francis Harrison, died at the scene, the spokesman said. His
69-year-old wife Phyllis was hospitalized in satisfactory
condition.
   The couple's daughter said the couple had come to the country to
celebrate their grandson's 21st birthday.
   Halgryn said police were searching for the attackers, who also
stole the couple's watches.

   Liberians are ``dying like flies''
because rice shipments sent by the United States and France are
being unloaded too slowly in Liberia's capital, a Belgian official
said Tuesday.
   Hunger is acute, and ``people are so undernourished that rice is
not enough. Milk, fish, meat and cooking oil are needed,'' said Dr.
Pieter Rykelhykhuizen of the Belgian branch of Doctors without
Borders.
   Rykelhykhuizen, who came to Freetown from Monrovia on Monday
night aboard a U.S. Marine helicopter, said the security situation
in Monrovia was good, but that remnants of Doe's army were
harassing relief workers.
   He said Doctors without Borders is the only relief agency still
operating in Liberia. But Karen Donovan, a spokeswoman for Catholic
Relief Services, said the Baltimore-based agency also had people
working there.
   Rykelykhuizen said other relief agencies had sent people only to
assess the situation. ``Relief workers and not assessment teams are
needed as people are dying like flies daily because of the food
problem,'' he said in an interview.
   Donovan said her relief agency was helping to unload U.S. rice
sent to the country. She said there were five members of the agency
in Buchanan, Liberia's second biggest city, and one in Monrovia.
   The United States sent 1,930 tons of rice to Monrovia aboard a
ship chartered by the French government. Rykelykhuizen said a barge
hired by the U.N. World Food Program to carry 600 tons of rice also
was there.
   They arrived on Thursday, but the food still was being unloaded,
Rykelykhuizen said.
   The French Embassy in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, said ``technical
problems are slowing down the offloading.''
   Claude Demiautte, the embassy's shipping officer, said security
precautions were partly to blame. Hungry people and soldiers have
looted most food supplies in Monrovia. People are trying to survive
eating leaves.
   Liberia has been devastated by a 10-month-old civil war in which
three warring sides have killed more than 5,000 civilians. A
breakaway rebel faction and soldiers loyal to slain President
Samuel Doe have agreed to a cease-fire.
   A five-nation West African army sent to stop the killing is
fighting outside the capital against another rebel faction, led by
Charles Taylor.

   A man suspected in the killings of a
dozen coin workers in the United States and Canada died in an
Anchorage jail Tuesday of an apparent heart attack, authorities
said.
   Charles T. Sinclair, 44, was fighting extradition to Montana to
face murder charges in the slayings of two people in a coin shop in
Billings, Mont., on July 31. He was arrested Aug. 13 near his home
in Kenney Lake, 175 miles northeast of Anchorage.
   Authorities said Sinclair was being sought for questioning in at
least 12 slayings, most of them in the western United States.
   
   Sinclair suffered an apparent heart attack in a maximum-security
cell at the jail, said state Corrections Commissioner Susan
Humphrey-Barnett. Guards were unable to resuscitate him, she said.
   The Alaska State Troopers were asked to investigate and an
autopsy would likely be performed, she said. It is the first time
an inmate has died at the 8-year-old jail, she said.
   Sinclair had been taking medication for high blood pressure when
he was admitted to the jail Aug. 15, as well as two narcotic-based
drugs for pain and for a thyroid condition, Humphrey-Barnett said.
   Medical staff at the jail discontinued his pain medication and
cut in half his daily dosage of Inderal for high blood pressure.
After Sinclair complained on Sept. 24, the 80-milligram dosage was
reinstated, she said.
   While at the jail, his blood-pressure readings hadn't changed
significantly, she said.
   Sinclair also had been charged with wounding a coin shop owner
in Murray, Utah, last May.
   Investigators wanted to question Sinclair in connection with
killing coin shop workers in Everett, Wash., in January 1980;
Vacaville, Calif., in November 1986; Spokane, Wash., in July 1987;
Kansas City, Mo., in March 1988; Watertown, N.Y., in September
1989; and Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 19.
   Montana Gov. Stan Stephens requested Sinclair's extradition on
Aug. 23, and Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper approved it on Sept. 11.
Sinclair had delayed his return to Montana partly on grounds that
the state's death penalty law is unconstitutional, Curtner said.

<HEAD>Church Blasts Caribbean Government for Bleak Economy</HEAD>

   Roman Catholic bishops
delivered an unusually strong attack Tuesday, saying the government
needed to give Dominicans a ``little hope'' to help them through
the economic crisis.
   Prices for food and gasoline have skyrocketed in recent months,
leading to long lines and shortages. After Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in August, the government had to cut its oil imports and
triple oil prices. Blackouts leave this island country without
electricity for up to 18 hours a day.
   ``Precise, energetic and efficient'' measures are required to
combat shortages of goods ``that should be accessible to common
people but have disappeared from the shelves,'' the church
communique said.
   ``The almost permanent darkness that covers the Dominican
territory not only irritates, but turns gloomier our already
desperate situation,'' the statement said.
   It implied that a lack of leadership was aggravating this
Caribbean nation's ills.
   ``We believe the government should begin by offering an example
of coordination, coherence, honesty and discipline that compels the
citizenry to do its share,'' said the church communique.
   A few measures like this would give citizens a ``little hope,
and return to the government its lost credibility,'' it said.
   The church has been generally supportive of President Joaquin
Balaguer's conservative administration. The 84-year-old blind
leader was narrowly re-elected to his second four-year term in May
over leftist Juan Bosch.
   A majority of the country's 7 million Spanish-speaking people
are Roman Catholic, and the church's word carries considerable
weight in the population.

   Sen. Jesse Helms accused Democrat Harvey
Gantt on Tuesday of injecting race into the campaign, while Gantt
said the comments were an insult to North Carolina voters.
   A Gantt ad being played on black radio stations says Gantt would
be good for ``us'' on education and other issues.
   ``He is saying one thing to the black citizens of the state and
he's saying another to all the rest of the citizens,'' the senator
told about 60 people during a campaign stop.
   Helms says he does not object to the strategy, but does object
to Gantt's claims that he is sending the same message to all
people.
   ``Don't let Senator Helms tell you Harvey Gantt is doing
something secret and sinister,'' Gantt told an enthusiastic crowd
of about 500 people. ``I ask you, how can Harvey Gantt be running a
secret campaign on black radio stations? This insults the voters of
this state.''
   During his Kinston appearance, Helms twice brought up his vote
to sustain President Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act, which he
said included quotas that would require the hiring of certain
proportions of minorities.
   ``If you want quotas to dominate and dictate whether you get a
job or get a promotion, you vote for Mr. Gantt,'' he said.
   Helms peppered his speeches with other references to blacks. He
said Gantt had disappointed some blacks by applying for a
minority-owned television station while mayor of Charlotte, then
selling it for a profit.
   ``No wonder he has a swimming pool in his backyard and a tennis
court,'' Helms said.
   Asked about the Federal Communications Commission's findings
that Gantt had done nothing wrong in the transaction, Helms said,
``They just didn't investigate it.''
   Helms reasserted claims that Gantt's campaign is being
bankrolled by Helms' enemies.
   ``It's being paid for by homosexuals and lesbians,'' he said.
``They don't care all that much for Harvey Gantt. They want to get
this conservative voice out of the United States Senate. They do
not like what I do.''
   Helms tried to temper his opposition to homosexuality.
   ``People can do what they want to in the privacy of their own
homes,'' he said, ``but when they start marching in the street and
say that homosexuality should be given special privileges and be
treated as a normal lifestyle, you bet I say no.''
   Helms, who was unable to personally campaign in North Carolina
for many weeks because of a long session of Congress, said he's
found supporters enthusiastic since he returned. And he said with a
good turnout next Tuesday, election day, Republicans will triumph.

<HEAD>Kirkpatrick Says U.S. Cannot Allow Limited Iraqi Withdrawal from
Kuwait</HEAD>

   The United States cannot allow Saddam Hussein to
negotiate a limited withdrawal that would allow the Iraq to keep
some Kuwaiti territory, Jeane Kirkpatrick, former U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations, said Tuesday.
   Speaking at the 56th annual convention of the Associated Press
Managing Editors on the first day of a four-day meeting, Ms.
Kirkpatrick said the Iraqi leader would interpret partial
withdrawal as a victory.
   ``Saddam Hussein is an aggressive man who already has used force
and the threat of force against every one of his neighbors,'' she
said. ``If he had rewards from this aggression ... I have no doubt
that he would move on.''
   Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would be especially
vulnerable, said Ms. Kirkpatrick, a professor of political science
at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
   But President Bush is unlikely to accept a partial withdrawal,
she said, noting, ``He has told us again and again and again he
will not.''
   The Persian Gulf crisis - precipitated by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
and annexation of its gulf-rich neighbor and the mobilization of a
U.S.-led multinational force in Saudi Arabia - is the first test of
the post-Cold War era, Ms. Kirkpatrick said.
   Had the invasion taken place five years ago, she said, it would
have been perceived as a Soviet bid for control of the Persian Gulf
and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Superpower cooperation and the weakening of Communism have
reduced it to a personal power grab, and the refusal of what used
to be the Soviet bloc to support Iraq in the United Nations is a
sign of the new world order, she said.
   Ms. Kirkpatrick said the end of the Cold War will allow the
United States to turn its focus inward, devoting its attention and
resources to ``some really aching domestic problems, frankly, which
I think we have not attended to as well as we could have.''
   Isolationism from world affairs will not work, she cautioned,
but neither shuld the United States act as a ``global policeman.''
   America's actions in the Persian Gulf go beyond self-interest,
she said, because the invasion of Kuwait has global importance.
   ``We are not that energy-dependent on the Gulf ... Our domestic
resources are in fact rich and our hemispheric energy resources are
rich. We can provide our own needs,'' she said.
   She said the world is witnessing the death throes of communism,
but is unsure what form of government will now emerge in Eastern
Europe.
   Ms. Kirkpatrick said she doubts Communism can be revived. ``I
think this is a Humpty Dumpty which will never be put back together
again,'' she said.

   Attorney General Steve Clark testified
Tuesday at his theft trial that he never meant to abuse a
state-issued credit card and made honest mistakes when filling out
expense forms.
   Clark appeared to choke back tears during his testimony, telling
the jury: ``I never in my entire life meant to mislead or deceive
or misrepresent.''
   Clark faces one charge of felony theft by deception. He is
accused of entertaining friends, girlfriends, relatives and
political supporters on his state Visa card.
   He testified that he accidentally recorded as guests people who
didn't eat meals with him when he itemized bills months later, but
he said repeatedly he was given no restrictions on how to spend his
$5 million budget.
   ``I have tried to pay all personal entertainment that is on the
card,'' Clark said during 2{ hours of testimony.
   Clark, whose annual salary is $26,500, took the stand after a
judge denied a defense motion to dismiss the charge. Circuit Judge
Perry Whitmore said Clark didn't have authority to use the credit
card how he wished.
   ``Any use of these funds, whether in Little Rock or in Memphis,
was inappropriate for there were no appropriations by the
Legislature for that purpose,'' Whitmore said.
   Prosecutor Chris Piazza accused Clark earlier in the trial of
improperly billing taxpayers at least $8,448.27 on his credit card
for the meals of personal guests on 56 occasions from 1986 to 1989.
Clark could get up to 20 years in prison and a $15,000 fine if
convicted.
   More than 100 of 141 witnesses who testified against Clark in
the last week said they either didn't dine with Clark or didn't
discuss state business, despite claims to the contrary that Clark
made on his expense forms.
   The state rested its case Monday with the testimony of three
women. The women said they didn't know the state paid for their
dinners, which sometimes topped $300 a meal.
   Clark's former fiancee, Carrie Christie of Atlanta, testified
that Clark dated her, popped the question and later got his
engagement ring back during more than a dozen meals and trips paid
for by the state in 1986 and 1987.
   She said they broke off their engagement during an Atlanta meal
Clark's expense forms show was held to discuss ``low-level waste.''
She said the topic never came up.
   In some of her most damaging testimony, she said Clark often
jotted down notes on the back of his Visa receipts. Clark has said
his record-keeping was sloppy and that he reconstructed his expense
forms up to three months after the fact.
   ``I could have spent more time. I could have done a better job''
with expense records, Clarks said. ``But if I had to do it again, I
would do it much different and I would do it much better.''
   Cheryl Pruett of Germantown, Tenn., testified she spent the
night at a Memphis, Tenn., hotel with Clark that records show the
state paid for. In honor of her birthday, Clark paid $245 with the
Visa card at a Germantown restaurant, she said.
   Karen Aufdenberg of Little Rock testified she attended at least
eight meals for which the state was billed, including four in New
Orleans.
   ``There are times in my job, because I am divorced, I would
think an escort was appropriate because the functions were for
couples,'' Clark said.
   Clark, a Democrat, has been the Arkansas attorney general since
1979.
   He said he always paid for the women's airfare and routinely
reimbursed the state for dozens of social meals that were
originally charged to the credit card.
   Clark said it was difficult for him to determine when the state
should pay for meals for others because he often mixed business
with pleasure.
   ``I live, eat sleep and breath politics,'' he said. ``That is
the truth. It's not necessarily good, but it's the truth.''
   Clark said publicity surrounding his state expense
reimbursements derailed his plans to run for governor.
   Piazza was to cross-examine Clark on Wednesday.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization on
Tuesday asked Arab nations to drop longstanding objections to
Israel's U.N. membership.
   In a private meeting of Arab ambassadors, Palestinian and other
Arab diplomats said PLO head envoy Nasser al-Kidwa proposed the
Arabs accept Israel's General Assembly credentials.
   However, the Arabs would propose an amendment to the official
membership list that reminds Israel of its obligation to obey
Security Council and General Assembly resolutions on the Middle
East.
   Among these are Security Council resolutions attacking Israel's
declaration of a unified Jerusalem as its capital.
   General Assembly resolutions call for separate homelands for
Palestinian and Jews, and guarantee the right of Palestinian exiles
to go home to the new Palestine.
   Israel's U.N. Mission was informed of the proposal. ``The issue
is still being studied. Our first reaction is that any singling out
of Israel is unacceptable,'' said Israeli sources, speaking on
condition of not being further identified.
   The Arab ambassadors too were unable to agree immediately on the
PLO proposal. One problem for them seemed to be whether voting for
Israel's U.N. membership, even with those amendments, would
constitute recognition of Israel.
   ``I think they are very concerned about the implications
themselves,'' said one Western ambassador who is an expert on the
Middle East.
   The chairman of the Arab group, Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammad
Abulhasan, said he would likely ask the General Assembly president
to delay consideration of the membership issue rather than take it
up Thursday, as scheduled.
   Since 1982, the Arabs have challenged Israel's right to sit in
the General Assembly, claiming it is not a peace-loving state, as
required by the U.N., Charter.
   The Arabs lost every year, and last year the Soviet Union
abstained on the issue rather than voting with them. The socialist
bloc of countries split three ways on the issue rather than backing
the Arabs.
   In 1989, the Assembly voted 95-37 to seat Israel; in 1988, the
vote was 85-39, with some nations absent or abstaining each year.
   The Arabs had been losing votes on the issue each year, and this
year the Soviets were expected to vote in favor of Israel, some
Arabs said.
   Al-Kidwa characterized the PLO's move as ``a more positive
approach'' the Israel-Palestinian issue.
   This is the first major new diplomatic move by al-Kidwa, who is
a nephew of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   Veteran PLO Ambassadr Zuhdi Labib Terzi retired from his
16-year posting as head of the delegation last month to become an
adviser to Arafat, and al-Kidwa took his place.
   Al-Kidwa said the amendment to the membership report he was
proposing would make reference to about 20 Security Council
resolutions on the status of Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.
   Observers believed that hard-line Arab states such as Syria,
Libya and Iraq would be unable to support the PLO proposal if it is
viewed as amounting to some form of recognition of Israel.
   In 1948, the newly founded Israeli government was willing to
accept the General Assembly resolutions setting up two states, but
the Arab nations rejected the two-state idea and attacked Israel
the day after it declared itself a nation.
   Israel captured about half the land that was supposed to become
an Arab Palestinian state, and the other half was divided between
Jordan and Egypt.
   The Israeli government has claimed since then that it needs to
retain some of the occupied territory as a buffer against Arab
attacks.
   In 1988, Arafat became the first Arab leader to endorse the
two-state concept originally devised by the United Nations.

<TEXT>
   A former winery worker was convicted
of six counts of first-degree murder Tuesday for a wine-country
killing spree that left seven people dead, including his wife and
two young daughters.
   Defendant Ramon Salcido was found guilty of second-degree murder
in the seventh slaying.
   Salcido, 29, could be sentenced to die in the gas chamber at San
Quentin Prison when the jury returns for the trial's penalty phase.
Under California law, multiple murder is one of the ``special
circumstances'' which can justify a death sentence.
   The panel apparently agreed with Sonoma County prosecutor Peter
Bumerts that Salcido methodically criss-crossed the fertile Sonoma
Valley north of San Francisco, stabbing and shooting his family and
co-workers the morning of April 14, 1989.
   ``What this means for the families is perhaps one chapter of
this horrible nightmare will be laid to rest,'' Bumerts after the
verdicts were read.
   ``I can't say I was delighted by it, but I wasn't shocked,''
said defense attorney Marteen Miller. ``One way or another, I think
this jury had its mind made up.''
   Salcido sat quietly as the verdicts were read in San Mateo
County Superior Court. He also was convicted of two counts of
attempted murder and cleared of one count of attempted voluntary
manslaughter.
   The jury received the case on Wednesday and deliberated
Thursday, Monday and most of Tuesday.
   First-degree murder convictions require proof of premeditation
and defense attorneys had urged jurors to opt for second-degree
murder or manslaughter.
   Although Salcido confessed to the crimes, his lawyers tried to
save his life by portraying Salcido as mentally unstable and
incapable of planning the slayings.
   During the three-month trial, the defense tried unsuccessfully
to show that Salcido had lost touch with reality and was suicidal
when he went on the killing spree.
   Miller argued Salcido was crazed because of a psychotic
depression that was aggravated by a cocaine-and-alcohol binge just
before the slayings.
   According to testimony, Salcido began the killing frenzy after a
night of bar-hopping. When he arrived home about 5 a.m., he was
furious that his wife was gone.
   He grabbed the couple's three young girls and drove to the
county dump, where he slashed each child's throat and left the
girls to die. Only one of the girls, Carmina, then 2, survived,
telling investigators, ``Daddy cut me.''
   Salcido's next stop was his mother-in-law's home, where he went
looking for his wife and ended up fatally stabbing Marian Richards
and her two daughters. When he returned home, Salcido fatally shot
his wife, Angela, and headed for the Gran Cru Winery, where he
killed his boss, Tracey Toovey.
   Salcido also went to the home of his co-worker, Ken Butti, and
shot at Butti and his wife, Terri, before fleeing. He hit Butti in
the shoulder.
   Salcido confessed to the crimes when he was arrested near his
birthplace in western Mexico four days after the killings. He told
investigators he was angry at his wife because she had hidden the
fact that their oldest daughter was fathered by another man.
   The taped confession was key evidence for the prosecution.
   Prosecutor Bumerts scoffed at the defense contention that
Salcido was suicidal, saying the killer stepped over bodies to
bandage his finger, which he cut while stabbing a victim to death.
   Miller, the defense attorney, argued that Salcido was legally
incapable of first-degree murder. Defense witnesses testified
Salcido suffered from psychotic depression and was under stress
because of mounting financial and legal problems.
   Heavy drinking and drug use sparked the violence, pushing
Salcido to kill blindly, Miller maintained.
   But the defense suffered a setback when several witnesses denied
having told investigators that Salcido appeared drunk in the hours
before the slayings.
   Lawyers sparred over the amount of cocaine Salcido ingested
before the killings. Bumerts said cocaine wasn't a factor in the
killings, while Miller contended the drug contributed to the
violence. Toxicologists failed to resolve the dispute.
   The trial was moved to San Mateo County, south of San Francisco,
because of heavy pre-trial news coverage in Sonoma County, where
the crimes were committed.
   The jury handed down first-degree murder verdicts for fatally
shooting his wife and slashing the throats of daughters Sofia, 4,
and Teresa, 22 months. He was found guilty of attempted murder in
the attack on daughter Carmina, now 4, who has been adopted by a
wealthy couple.
   He was also convicted of first-degree murder for fatally
stabbing his mother-in-law, Marian Richards, 47, and her daughter,
Ruth, 12, and shooting his 35-eyar-old boss, Toovey, to death. The
second-degree conviction came in the slashing death of Marie
Richards, 8.
   Salcido also was found guilty of attempted murder in the attack
on Butti, but was cleared of a similar charge for shooting at
Butti's wife, who was not wounded.

   Students at Smith College occupied a
building for a fifth day Tuesday, vowing to remain until
administrators come up with plans to enlarge a center for minority
organizations.
   ``We are not in this to get arrested. We're in there because
we've been pushed to do it,'' said Vivian Chiang, a senior and
chairwoman of the Asian-American Students Association at the
exclusive women's college.
   ``For eight years our pleas and our demands have been ignored,''
she said.
   School authorities said they recognize that the Mwangi Cultural
Center in Lilly Hall is too small and are working on a redesign
plan to accommodate other cultural organizations at the college.
   The protesters said only the Black Student Alliance and
Nosotras, a Hispanic group, have offices in the center and that
administrators have been promising more space since 1983.
   The protesters, many of them of Asian descent, have occupied the
main administration building since Friday. About 20 students sleep
in the halls at night and as many as 60 students have occupied the
building during the day, some leaving from time to time to attend
classes, Chiang said.
   Business goes on as usual around the protesters, and
administrators said they do not plan to call in police unless the
protest becomes disruptive.
   ``We haven't ruled out the possibility of arrest, but we would
only do that as a last resort,'' said school spokeswoman Debra
Bradley. ``We hope that we can reach some kind of compromise,''
   About two dozen students sat silently for an hour Tuesday in the
office of college President Mary Maples Dunn, leaving when the
office closed at 5:30 p.m.
   Dunn called the students ``determined young people'' but said
they were too impatient. She said space would probably be available
by next September.
   About 17 percent of the school's 2,600 students are non-white,
school officials said.
   Kamina Henderson, vice chairwoman of the Black Student Alliance,
said her group supports the sit-in, but noted members don't want
changes to affect the offices they already have.

<TEXT>
   A general wants state
police to keep anti-war protesters away from entrances to the
nation's largest Air Force Reserve base, but state and local
officials don't think that is necessary.
   Brig. Gen. Frederick D. Walker, commander of the 439th Military
Airlift Wing, asked Gov. Michael S. Dukakis to send state police to
handle the protesters. They have gathered outside the gates weekly
since Aug. 27 to protest the U.S. deployment in the Persian Gulf.
   Westover Air Force Base is the main staging area in the
Northeast for cargo flights to Saudi Arabia.
   In an Oct. 9 letter to Dukakis, Walker contended that Chicopee
police had ``coddled and placated'' the demonstrators, who are
opposing the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East precipitated
by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``A huge fuel truck inbound to the base was delayed by the
Chicopee police for 45 minutes while a city policeman pleaded with
the protesters to `temporarily' stand aside to let the fuel truck
pass,'' he wrote. ``This is an outrage.''
   State police have observed the weekly demonstrations since
Walker made his complaint but ``did not observe any violations of
the law,'' said Jeff Grossman, a spokesman for the state Department
of Public Safety.
   ``It does not appear that any state police assistance to
Chicopee police is necessary,'' Grossman said.
   Chicopee Mayor Joseph J. Chessey said the general had
overreacted and his complaint might serve only to attract more
protesters.
   ``I don't personally agree with the protesters, but they have
rights and in the general's mind those rights should be denied,''
Chessey said. ``This is America. This is not Iraq.''
   The protest drew two people Monday, but on other occasions
several dozen people have shown up, Chessey said.
   Twenty-one protesters were arrested Oct. 20 for blocking two
base gates. Two protesters were arrested Aug. 27.
   Walker was in Georgia and efforts to reach him for comment were
unsuccessful Tuesday.
   Police Chief Joseph J. Wilk Jr. said he orders arrests only when
the protesters block both lanes and refuse to allow traffic to pass
into the base.
   ``As far as I'm concerned ... there have been no dangerous
situations up there,'' Wilk said. ``And as far as I'm concerned,
it's been a minimal inconvenience.''

   A prosecutor went too far when he told a
jury that convicting a man for possessing four-tenths of a gram of
cocaine could help win the war on drugs, a state appeals court
ruled in ordering a new trial.
   The Appellate Division of Superior Court ruled Monday that
Curtis D. Gerald was denied a fair trial. Gerald had been sentenced
to one year's probation and ordered to pay $1,530 in fines and
assessments.
   The ruling said Atlantic County Assistant Prosecutor David Myer
``improperly diverted the jury'' from considering the case against
Gerald by referring to Colombian drug cartels in his summation and
telling jurors decision could help attack a societal problem.
   Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blintz admitted the mistake
Monday and said the ruling would not be appealed. He said no
retrial date had been set.

   A man who believed his wife was having
an affair went to his suspected rival's workplace early Tuesday and
shot him to death before turning the gun on himself, police said.
   Clemente Ortiz, 49, fatally shot Cecilio Reyes, 50, outside The
Edwin Gaynor Co., an electrical wiring manufacturer where Reyes was
a foreman, police said.
   Ortiz, of Bridgeport, knocked on a window to summon Reyes, who
grabbed a .25 caliber semiautomatic handgun from his coat pocket
before heading outside to the parking lot, said Capt. Michael
Kovach.
   Outside, the men fired at each other several times, Kovach said.
Reyes died after being shot in the head.
   Ortiz then put the barrel of his 9mm semiautomatic handgun in
his own mouth and pulled the trigger, Kovach said.
   Kovach said police were trying to reach Ortiz's wife, Eulalia,
who they believed to be in New York with the couple's 4-year-old
daughter.
   The factory, a one-story concrete building in a grassy
industrial park, was closed after the shooting.

   Former President Reagan dropped in on his
hometown Tuesday, lunching at a boyhood home and skipping stones at
the swimming hole where he saved lives as a teen-ager.
   Reagan was greeted by adoring crowds in this northern Illinois
town of 15,700. He led 225 flag-waving children in the Pledge of
the Allegiance and bashed Democrats and Saddam Hussein when he got
the chance.
   ``I love and remember Dixon as the place I always know I can
come home to,'' Reagan said.
   The visit coincided with the release of Reagan's memoirs.
   He was born in nearby Tampico in 1911 and lived in several Dixon
houses with his parents, Jack and Nelle, and older brother Neil.
The son of a shoe salesman and a dress-maker, Reagan lived in Dixon
from 1920 until until he left to attend Eureka College near Peoria
in 1928.
   Reagan ate lunch at the Boyhood Home Museum, the first house in
Dixon where the Reagan family lived. The two-story, white-frame
house was bought by a private group in 1980 and made into a museum
with Reagan memorabilia and period furniture.
   Reagan talked with several old Dixon friends and skipped stones
at the swimming beach where, local legend has it, he saved 76
people from drowning as a life guard over seven summers. He also
stopped at the vacant grade school he attended in Dixon, about 100
miles west of Chicago.
   ``Does anybody know who that is?'' Reagan joked at a life-size
bronze statue of himself. Later, he gave a pep talk at Dixon High
School attended by about 3,000 people who honored him as ``our most
famous graduate.''
   He donned a Dixon letter jacket emblazoned with his graduating
year, 1928, and tossed a football with members of the Dixon Dukes
football team.
   Reagan criticized the Democratic-controlled Congress for its
role in producing a federal budget that raises taxes.
   ``This budget was forced on the administration by Congress,'' he
said.
   He denounced Saddam for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We have to keep up the pressure until that madman gives up,''
Reagan said.
   Reagan congratulated his old counterpart, Mikhail Gorbachev, for
winning the Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``He had it coming,'' Reagan said. ``Before he came to power,
the Soviet Union was a threat to the world. That's not true
anymore. They are trying to be more like us.''

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic bishop of Tonga
said Tuesday the AIDS epidemic was part of the ``lethal rubbish of
Western society'' and suggested that distributing condoms would
spread the disease.
   Bishop Patelisio Finau told delegates at a conference of the
South Pacific Commission, the regional development agency, that
condoms probably had done more to spread permissiveness in society
than any other factor.
   ``A whole generation has grown up thinking, `We can do what we
like as long as we are wearing a little bit of rubber,''' he said.
   ``Do we have to be satisfied with giving our people the lethal
rubbish of Western society and sit back and see them become addicts
of the consumer society with just a bit of rubber between
themselves and death?''
   Finau said ``safe sex'' was a ``road to death.'' The AIDS
epidemic proves what the church has said about proper sexual
conduct, he said.
   AIDS is the topic of this year's meeting of the South Pacific
Commission, which brings together representatives of the 22 island
countries of the South Pacific.
   Since 1985, the islands have reported 214 people testing
positive for the virus that causes AIDS; 47 of the carriers have
died.
   Fiji's health minister, Dr. Apenisa Kuruisaqila, made a plea for
tolerance: ``We must make known to our community and religious
educators that our concern must not be just for the hereafter, but
for the here and now,'' he said.
   ``We have to communicate with our young people ... even if it's
by means of sexually explicit language. If so, we can avoid the
specter of parents asking why our young people have been allowed to
die when it could have been prevented,'' Kuruisaqila said.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of Sun Hung Kai Property Ltd., one
of this colony's largest property groups, died Tuesday of heart
failure. He was 79.
   Kwok Tak-seng, listed in February's HongKong inc. magazine as
worth $1.32 billion, making him one of the territory's wealthiest
individuals, took Sun Hung Kai public in 1972.
   While his family retained control of the business, it prospered
with Hong Kong's growing importance as a financial center,
benefiting from spiraling land values.
   A Sun Hung Kai official said that while Kwok had stopped working
fulltime in recent years, he had remained active in the group's
day-to-day operations. The company will be run by its board until a
successor is picked, she said.
   News of Kwok's death dampened trading activity on the Hong Kong
stock exchange, traders said, where Sun Hung Kai's shares dipped 30
cents to close at 14.30 Hong Kong dollars.
   Keith Wu, a senior analyst at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers Hong
Kong Ltd., portrayed Kwok as a widely admired businessmen who
ranked among Hong Kong's most influential tycoons. While his death
may cast a temporary pall over the company, it isn't expected to
hurt its operations, he said.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   A woman who locked her 5-year-old
daughter in a car while she worked part-time went to court Tuesday
to regain custody of the girl from the county, but court officials
said the judge didn't rule.
   Police and court officials said the case was continued. They
spoke on condition of anonymity because Family Court rules require
that cases be kept confidential.
   The mother, Chante Fernandez, canceled a news conference she had
planned after the hearing and refused to speak to reporters as she
dashed from the Union County Courthouse to a limousine. Her
attorney and police officers shielded Ms. Fernandez from the nearly
reporters who waited in the courthouse garage.
   Ms. Fernandez' daughter, Anjuli, is under the care of the New
Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services pending resolution of
the case. The girl wasn't present at the hearing, a welfare
official said.
   Ms. Fernandez, 24, of Elizabeth, was jailed after police found
her pajama-clad daughter, Anjuli, in the trunk of a car on Oct. 20
at the Woodbridge Center mall, where Mrs. Fernandez worked
part-time on weekends. The back seat was folded down so the girl
could move about inside the car, and the mother said she checked on
her daughter during work breaks.
   The mother said her combined income of nearly $500 a week from
two jobs disqualified her from local or state child care services.
During the week, she was a secretary at a lumber company; the
weekend job was at a department store in the mall.
   The case has drawn an outpouring of support from New Jersey
residents, who have offered her money, child care help and jobs.
   Ms. Fernandez pleaded guilty Friday to a disorderly persons
offense and received a $100 suspended fine.
   The mother, who is divorced, said she left her daughter in the
car while she worked at the mall because she was unable to find a
reliable and affordable baby sitter. She also said she couldn't get
local or state child care services.
   Ms. Fernandez initially was charged with criminal restraint, a
felony, and spent two days in jail before posting $5,000 bail. The
prosecutor reduced the charge to a disorderly persons offense after
reviewing the case and concluding that the girl wasn't neglected or
abused.
   Only Ms. Fernandez, her attorney, state welfare officials and
court officers were allowed inside the hearing before Union County
Judge John Callahan on Tuesday.
   Some relatives of Ms. Fernandez were allowed to stand outside
the second- floor courtroom, but were stopped at the lobby.

   Alfred Sauvy, a well-known sociologist who studied

hospital, the National Institute of Demographic Studies said. He
was 92.
   Considered something of a prophet among his peers, Sauvy
predicted the 1968 student riots in his book ``The Rise of Youth,''
published in 1959.
   Pessimistic about the world's population explosion, he
nevertheless criticized France's falling birth rate.
   Sauvy founded the National Institute of Demographic Studies and
was its director from 1945-62.

<HEAD>Cisneros Says Intense Scrutiny OK if Media Exercises Fairness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intense media scrutiny of political candidates is
beneficial so long as journalists practice ``fairness to the max,''
former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros said Tuesday.
   ``I suspect what we're in for is a future where this kind of
scrutiny becomes the order of the day,'' said Cisneros, whose
personal life has undergone media scrutiny.
   But while openness is important, it has a price, Cisneros said
at the 56th annual convention of the Associated Press Managing
Editors.
   ``There will be no heroes, because there are no perfect
people,'' he said, adding that the media will ``scare some people
off.''
   Cisneros, who appears poised for a political comeback,
complained that he was treated unfairly by the media near the end
of his eight-year tenure as mayor of Texas' third-largest city.
   After announcing in 1988 that he would decline to seek a third
term in 1989, reports surfaced that he had an extramarital affair.
Cisneros said he left politics because of financial pressures
exacerbated by his son's ill health.
   He said a misconception persists that reports of the affair
drove him out of office.
   Cisneros said he thought he was leaving office to take care of
private problems outside the glare of publicity, but found that the
opposite happened.
   Although Cisneros and his wife made joint public appearances
recently, there remains widespread public speculation about his
private life.
   Despite his concern about the coverage, Cisneros said
revelations about candidates' private lives have allowed voters to
``choose between real people, not cardboard, paste-up people.''

   Iraq claimed its agents in Kuwait seized a
secret document that shows the CIA and Kuwaiti intelligence were
plotting against Iraq prior to Saddam Hussein's invasion of the
emirate.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz sent a copy of the purported
document to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and
requested that it be circulated in the Security Council, which is
considering the gulf crisis.
   The document, undated and labeled ``top secret and private,'' is
alleged to be a letter from the head of Kuwait's State Security
Department to the Minister of the Interior concerning a meeting at
Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in November 1989.
   Iraq claims it found the document in Kuwaiti government files.
   Aziz asserted the document ``clearly and unequivocally confirms
the connivance between the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the
intelligence services of the former Kuwaiti government in plotting
against Iraq's national security, territorial integrity and
national economy.''
   CIA spokesman Peter Earnest, after seeing a faxed copy of the
letter, said its contents ``are total fabrications and without
foundation.''
   He said no secret meeting took place between Kuwaiti officials
and CIA Director William Webster, although the deputy
director-general of Kuwaiti State Security paid a courtesy call on
Webster in November 1989.
   ``There was nothing discussed at that meeting concerning
Kuwait's relations with Iraq or any other countries,'' Earnest
said.
   The purported letter was sent by Brig. Fahd Ahmad Al-Fahd,
director-general of the State Security Department of Kuwait, to
Interior Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
   It describes an agreement allegedly reached with Webster in a
private meeting on Nov. 14, 1989.
   The letter says both sides agreed ``it was important to take
advantage of the deteriorating economic situation in Iraq in order
to put pressure on that country's government to delineate our
common border.''
   The letter says the CIA had suggested ``appropriate means of
pressure'' on Iraq. The United States was willing to provide
information on Shiite Moslem extremist groups in Kuwait and would
train 128 bodyguards for members of Kuwait's royal family, the
alleged letter states.

   A boiler pipe ruptured Tuesday on the USS
Iwo Jima, spewing out super-heated steam that killed 10 sailors.
   The accident aboard the amphibious assault ship and the death of
a Marine when his jeep overturned in Saudi Arabia boosted the
number of U.S. military deaths to 43 during the nearly 3-month-old
Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who
have departed us,'' said the Iwo Jima's commander, Capt. Michael
O'Hearn.
   The accident was the worst for the Navy in the U.S.-led air,
land and sea mobilization that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait. In the only other Navy fatality during Operation Desert
Shield, a sailor was electrocuted in August aboard the USS
Antietam.
   The Iwo Jima, part of the amphibious task force and U.S. naval
armada supporting Operation Desert Shield, left Bahrain an hour
before the 8:15 a.m. accident.
   ``It was only a couple of miles from the pier when the accident
occurred,'' said Lt. Kevin Wensing, a spokesman for Command Naval
Forces, Central Command.
   Wensing, who visited the ship after it returned to port, spoke
of the ``heroism'' of a well-trained crew who quickly ``secured the
(ship's) two boilers, anchored the ship, evacuated the injured
after their condition was stabilized, and collected the remains of
the dead.''
   He said because the boilers were shut off, and although the
vessel had emergency diesel generators for backup, it was towed
back to port with the help of Bahraini tugs.
   He described the mood of the rest of the 685-man crew and 1,100
Marines aboard as ``somber but very determined.''
   Six sailors died immediately after the accident. The Iwo Jima,
which played a major role in evacuating the 241 Marines killed by a
suicide bomber in Beirut in 1983, used its own helicopters to
transport four injured sailors to the hospital ship USS Comfort.
   Two of the injured died aboard the hospital ship, the Navy said.
The last two survivors were reported in very serious condition, and
late Tuesday afternoon the Pentagon in Washington confirmed they
also had died.
   Identities of eight of the killed were released by the Navy's
Atlantic Fleet. Two names were withheld pending notification of
next of kin. The Iwo Jima is based in Norfolk, Va.
   -David A. Gilliland, 21, Warrensburg, Mo.
   -Mark E. Hutchison, 27, Elkins, W. Va.
   -Daniel Lupatsky, 22, Centralia, Pa.
   -Daniel C. McKinsey, 21, Hanover, Pa.
   -Fred R. Parker Jr., 24, Reidsville, N.C.
   -James A. Smith Jr., 22, Somerville, Tenn.
   -John M. Snyder, 25, Milltown, N.J.
   -Robert L. Volden, 28, Rego Park, N.Y.
   The Marine who died, identified as 1st Lt. Michael N. Monroe,
27, of Auburn, Wash., was with three others from the 1st Battalion,
3rd Marines when their jeep overturned and went down a 20-foot
embankment, a military statement said. His companions were in
stable condition.
   In a related development, officials said three American sailors
were injured when their pickup truck was hit Monday by two
.50-caliber machine-gun rounds fired accidentally by a Marine
sentry.
   The accidental gunfire occurred as the sailors approached the
entrance to a Marine Corps facility. One sailor was hit by a bullet
in the shoulder and chest, the second was injured by glass shards
and the third suffered a concussion, a military statement said.

   A write-in candidate, Arne Carlson,
was named the Republican candidate for governor Tuesday after the
winner of the GOP primary election quit the race because of
allegations of sexual misconduct.
   Despite reservations about Carlson's moderate stands on social
issues, the party's 14-member executive committee voted unanimously
to unite behind the three-term state auditor, said party Chairman
Bob Weinholzer.
   He will face three-term Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   Republican nominee Jon Grunseth, who defeated Carlson in the
Sept. 11 primary, withdrew from the race on Sunday amid allegations
that he had an extramarital affair and encouraged teen-age girls to
swim nude with him in 1981.
   Grunseth denied the pool-party claims and said the affair ended
before he married his second wife in 1984.
   While Grunseth was mired in controversy, Carlson started a
write-in campaign Aug. 22.
   Weinholzer said the party decided it lacks an appropriate
committee to select a replacement and therefore, under state law,
decided to choose the primary runner-up to take on three-term
Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   State law allows a party to replace a candidate who drops out.
   Weinholzer said the Minnesota Supreme Court will decide who
should be Carlson's running mate.
   Weinholzer said Sharon Clark, Grunseth's running mate, had
refused to step aside as the GOP lieutenant governor nominee
without a court fight. Carlson's running mate is Joanell Dyrstad.
   ``We are awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court as to who
will be on the ballot, and will be proud to have either of them on
the ballot for lieutenant governor,'' Weinholzer said.
   Earlier Tuesday, Weinholzer said party headquarters has been
inundated with calls from people urging the GOP to back Carlson as
the best candidate to defeat Perpich.
   He said Carlson ``has got an organization that's up and running
right now.''
   ``He's got his phone banks going, volunteers all over the place,
good sums of money. He's got all the requirements to run a campaign
in the week we have left.''
   However, Carlson, a moderate on social issues and an abortion
rights advocate, has clashed publicly with members of the party's
strong conservative, anti-abortion faction.
   Secretary of State Joan Growe, the state's chief election
officer, said the GOP had until 5 p.m. Friday to get a new
candidate on an estimated 2 million supplemental ballots for the
governor's race.
   Perpich acknowledged Tuesday that a head-to-head contest with
Carlson would be tougher than the three-way race that existed until
Grunseth withdrew.
   ``The conditions that were last week, well, anyone could win
that one,'' he said.
   Perpich said the situation had changed since primary night, when
he sounded relieved that he would be facing Grunseth instead of
Carlson. For instance, he said tat in the interim he has regained
the allegiance of teachers and other organizations he had feared
could support Carlson.
   ``I think it's going to be a tidal wave,'' Perpich said of his
party's chances ``But, who knows, it could change in three days.''

<HEAD>`Abundance,' A Play by Beth Henley, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since ``Crimes of the Heart'' opened in New York
a decade ago, playwright Beth Henley has had a hard time coming up
with another play as good as her Pulitzer Prize-winner.
   The latest, ``Abundance,'' which arrived Tuesday at
off-Broadway's Manhattan Theater club, certainly isn't. It is a
sprawling, unfocused saga, as rambling and wide-open as the spaces
it celebrates in the Wild West of the 1860s.
   Like ``Crimes of the Heart,'' the play is a story of female
friendship, but the similarities end there.
   Henley tells the story of two mail-order brides, Bess and Macon,
who arrive in the Wyoming Territory to find themselves engaged to
two of the most umpromising men west of the Mississippi.
   Both women make do with what they get and survive, more or less.
Bess ends up with the brother of her intended after her fiance
chokes to death on a piece of corn bread. Macon marries a grizzled,
one-eyed widower whose farming fortunes rise and fall with the
weather.
   Bess is the timid one, Macon the free spirit, but in the end,
the mousey woman has the more exciting life. Bess is captured by
Indians, lives for five years as a squaw, and then finds fame and
fortune on the lecture circuit recounting her adventures with
``savages.'' Macon, after her husband deserts her, finds a pathetic
life working in a carnival show.
   The play is a story of dreams deferred and dreams transferred
from woman to woman, but it's far from a poignant, affecting tale.
There's a nasty edge to the characters, a whining sameness about
Bess and a greedy grasping that permeates Macon. They don't make
for characters you can root for over the 25-year span of the play.
   The playwright has even more trouble with their husbands - Jack
Flan, Bess' man, seems psychotic and in the end a toady, kowtowing
to her success. The farmer who marries Macon is more eccentric than
interesting, an unappealing buffoon.
   Director Ron Lagomarsino lets the play wander but that's easy to
do since the production spins on double turntables that keep
revolving to show the inside and outside of two log cabins. The
effect is headache-producing.
   The performers exude quirkiness, particularly Amanda Plummer,
who has made a career out of eccentric stage behavior. Tess Harper
is strident as the down-on-her-luck Macon. The unlikable husbands
are played by Lanny Flaherty and Michael Rooker.
   Designer Adrianne Lobel has provided a stunning mountain
panorama that can be glimpsed behind those ever-moving turntables.
And there is some sweet, almost haunting, ragtime music by Michael
Roth that sets the play up nicely for its sentimental ending.
   But there's not much emotion in the rest of the play. Only an
occasional funny line or heartfelt sigh that recall Henley's past
triumph. ``Abundance'' is mighty bare dramatic fare.

   Axl Rose, lead singer of Guns N'
Roses, was arrested Tuesday for allegedly hitting a neighbor woman
over the head with a wine bottle during an argument about loud
music, authorities said.
   Rose's neighbor Gabriela Kantor accused Rose of grabbing her
keys and tossing them off a balcony before emptying a wine bottle
and swinging it at her, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy
Roger Hom.
   Rose was arrested and booked for investigation of assault with a
deadly weapon. His business manager posted the $5,000 bail, said
Deputy Bill Linnemeyer and arraignment was set for Nov. 20.
   Kantor was taken to a hospital for observation and released.
   In a statement, Rose denied both striking the woman and playing
music loudly.
   Rose met with attorneys Tuesday to discuss whether to file a
complaint seeking an injunction against Ms. Kantor, said Bryn
Bridenthal, a spokeswoman for his record company, Geffen Records.
   ``He's been having problems with this woman for the past eight
months,'' Bridenthal said.
   In an earlier incident, deputies went to Rose's apartment Aug. 1
to ask him to turn down his stereo.
   Rose later filed a complaint saying one deputy forced his way
into the apartment while others tried to provoke him.
   Critics of the Los Angeles-based Guns N' Roses band have called
the band's lyrics homophobic and racist. The band gained notoriety
earlier this year after an obscenity-laced acceptance speech for a
music award on live television.

<HEAD>Central American Ministers Urge Salvadoran Rebels to Halt Attacks</HEAD>

   Five Central American foreign
ministers appealed Tuesday to leftist guerrillas to suspend their
attacks and renew peace talks with El Salvador's rightist
government.
   In a statement issued at the close of a two-day meeting here,
the ministers expressed hope that a cease-fire can be agreed upon
in the next round of El Salvador peace talks, scheduled to start
Nov. 4 in Mexico.
   Previous U.N.-sponsored negotiations between President Alfredo
Cristiani's government and rebels of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front have ended in deadlock.
   The statement expressed hope that ``as the dialogue proceeds a
cease-fire will be called in El Salvador, preventing the resurgence
of violence and fighting which has been victimizing the civilian
population.''
   In recent weeks, the guerrillas have launched a number of
attacks aimed at military targets that have caused civilian
casualties. More than 73,000 people have been killed in El Salvador
since the civil war began in 1979, according to human rights
groups.
   The guerrillas have refused to lay down their arms until the
Cristiani government agrees to a series of political reforms,
including cuts in the armed forces and prosecution of officers for
human rights violations.
   The Cristiani government insists that a cease-fire be agreed
upon first.
   Earlier this month, Congress approved legislation halving the
$85 million in military aid the Salvadoran government receives
annually from the United States. The cut starts in fiscal year
1991.
   But according to the bills, aimed at pressing for progress in
the negotiations, U.S. aid will be restored if the guerrillas
launch any major attacks and eliminated if the government refuses
to negotiate further.
   ``Central America should spare no efforts to seek peace in El
Salvador,'' the statement said. It was signed by Manuel Pacas
Castro of El Salvador, Mario Carias Zapata of Honduras, Enrique
Dreyfus of Nicaragua, Bernd Niehaus of Costa Rica, and Ariel Rivera
of Guatemala.
   The foreign ministers also tackled the issue of demilitarizing
the Central American region.
   A special security commission of defense chiefs will meet here
Nov. 14-15 to exchange ideas and plans on reducing Central American
armed forces, the statement said.
   Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, and has relied on a
police force for secuity ever since.
   The other four countries have military forces far beyond their
security needs, and civilian politicians are pressing to reduce
their size and influence in politics.
   Regional accords helped defuse the U.S.-supported Contra war in
Nicaragua. Efforts also are being made to negotiate an end to the
leftist rebel insurrection in Guatemala.
   The five presidents are scheduled to meet Dec. 15-16 in Costa
Rica for further talks.

   The defunct Mustang Ranch bordello remained in
government hands after a federal judge on Tuesday denied the
owners' request to sell the property to a group of private
investors.
   The ruling by a federal bankruptcy judge clears the way for the
Internal Revenue Service to auction off the ranch to pay off its
owners' back taxes.
   Lawyers for the owners, Joe and Sally Conforte, sought
permission from a federal bankruptcy judge to immediately sell the
440-acre ranch that once was America's best-known legal bordello.
   The IRS opposed a private sale, saying the property would bring
a higher price later. An IRS auction is scheduled for Nov. 13-14.
   Earlier this month, Storey County commissioners revoked the
Mustang's permit to operate as a brothel, which means it can't
re-open as a legal house of prostitution no matter who gets title.
   Austin Cooper, one of the Conforte's lawyers, said they had a
buyer willing to immediately put down $500,000 and pay a balance of
$1.6 million within three years.
   He argued the property is depreciating rapidly and taxpayers
would receive more from the sale if it went through immediately on
the Confortes' terms.
   The IRS said the couple no longer had claim to the property. The
105-room ranch operated as a legal brothel for 35 years.
   ``We felt the auction was not properly advertised to maximize
the number of bidders who might be interested,'' said Dierdre
Pagni, an IRS manager.
   The Mustang closed Sept. 18 when it was forced into liquidation
under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy code. For three days,
bankruptcy trustees sought to reopen the bordello to recoup about
$13 million in federal taxes owed by the Confortes, who did not
attend Tuesday's hearing.
   The IRS seized and padlocked the ranch Sept. 21 when the
trustees' efforts were hampered by cash flow and other problems.
   Rollin Thorley, representing the IRS, said the government will
sell the property for a minimum of $1.8 million.
   The ranch will be divided for auction into real estate, a
trailer park and personal property.

<HEAD>Authorities Take DNA Sample from Aborted Fetus in Rape Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police acquired the aborted fetus
of a 13-year-old girl so DNA tests could be performed to determine
whether her uncle got her pregnant during an alleged rape, a
prosecutors' spokesman said Tuesday.
   The effort to test the genetic tissue of an aborted fetus
apparently breaks new ground in the prosecution of rape cases, said
Tom Krampitz, executive director of the Texas District and County
Attorneys Association.
   ``As far as I know it's the first time that anybody has used
that to corroborate the testimony of the victim,'' he said.
   Ryland Hayden, 33, of Corpus Christi is charged with aggravated
sexual assault after his neice reported he raped her Aug. 9.
   The girl told authorities she was in a bed at her grandmother's
Corpus Christi house when she was awakened by someone smothering
her, a criminal complaint said. She said Hayden forced her to have
sexual intercourse after threatening to kill her if she cried out.
   The girl discovered she was pregnant after returning home to
Houston, and had an abortion, court affidavits said.
   A genetics laboratory has isolated the DNA from samples taken
from the fetus and the girl's blood. A sample of Hayden's blood
will be used for comparison with the fetus and the girl's blood.
   ``This test, once performed, can exclude up to 99 percent of the
male population as having been responsible for the pregnancy,''
Police Sgt. Phil Cunningham said in an affidavit.
   His affidavit was used in obtaining a search warrant needed to
take a blood sample from Hayden.
   Genetic fingerprinting usually is employed to allow scientists
to extract the unique biological code from tiny specks of evidence
such as semen, blood or hair roots.
   If the codes match, the scientists can testify about the
significance. If they fail to match, the information can exonerate
a suspect.

   An explosion and fire erupted from a
shut-down petroleum well as workers tried to cap it Tuesday,
killing two workers and leaving two others missing, the Coast Guard
said.
   A fifth worker suffered multiple injuries, including burns, and
was in serious condition at West Jefferson Medical Center in
suburban New Orleans, a nursing supervisor there said.
   Two Coast Guard helicopters and a search and rescue vessel
searched the marshes of Barataria Bay south of New Orleans for the
missing Tuesday evening, said Petty Officer Gene Maestas in New
Orleans.
   The well is about 15 miles north of Grand Isle, which lies
between the Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Maestas didn't know if it
was a gas or an oil well.
   The cause of the blast wasn't immediately known, Maestas said.
   He said the dead and missing all were male employees of a
Houston-based company called Pacer Atlas. There is no Houston phone
listing for Pacer Atlas.
   Firefighters took more than three hours to extinguish the blaze,
said Coast Guard Lt. Carl Edmiston.
   ODY Corp. of Lafayette hired Pacer Atlas to cap the well, said
an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Lawton Chiles said Tuesday night
that Gov. Bob Martinez is using distorted 30-second ads, while the
governor said his opponent would be too soft on criminals.
   In their lone televised debate, Chiles said Martinez is relying
on a $10 million warchest to bolster his bid for re-election.
   Chiles has raised $4 million while voluntarily limiting
contributions to $100 per person.
   One Martinez commercial indicates Chiles tried to abolish Social
Security cost of living adjustments. Chiles said he actually
proposed temporarily freezing the COLA as part of a
deficit-reduction plan while in the U.S. Senate.
   ``I look you in the eye tonight and I tell you that's not
true,'' Chiles said of the commercial's claim.
   Martinez called Chiles a liberal, Washington insider and
``political animal.''
   ``I'm not going to be governor of the state that's No. 1 in
crime,'' Chiles replied. He said Martinez's accomplishments on
crimes were mainly on ``press releases.'' He repeatedly challenged
Martinez to debate him on crime, the lottery, or other issues.
   Polls have indicated Martinez could be hurt because of his
anti-abortion activism,
   Martinez said Chiles had gone from anti-abortion to abortion
rights because of political pressure.
   ``You're not pro-choice, you're multiple choice,'' Martinez told
Chiles.
   Martinez's campaign has declined other debate opportunities,
claiming that they have little impact.
   Martinez' campaign manager, Mac Stipanovich, earlier
characterized the debate hosted by WCPX-TV in Orlando as ``60
minutes of posturing.''
   But the governor said: ``I want to impart what I've done during
my four years in office, about crime and drugs, victims' rights,
the environment, growth-management, ethics, educational reform.
   ``I don't know what the viewership is. I suspect that there will
be a good number of people watching but I'm sure it won't be the
top-rated show of the hour. We're there to debate, express ur
views and we are looking forward to it.''

   Police and firefighters were on alert Tuesday, a
curfew was in place and residents toted fire extinguishers on
special patrols for Devil's Night, Detroit's annual pre-Halloween
arson rampage.
   Officials refused to keep the media informed on arson blazes,
but reporters and citizens reported at least two possible cases by
11 p.m.
   ``I'm afraid. It's like you're a prisoner in your own house. I
wouldn't go out,'' said Mildred Koyton, 67.
   Koyton said that every Devil's Night she paces from her front
door to the back, ready to protect her two-story home next to an
empty lot where a house burned two years ago.
   ``All you can do is hope for the best,'' Koyton said. ``But
sometimes faith can be weakened when you see so much going on.''
   Last year, the mayor's office reported 223 fires from Oct. 29 to
Oct. 31, 115 of those on Devil's Night, the night before Halloween.
There are about 60 fires on a normal night in Detroit.
   The worst Devil's Night was in 1984, when 810 fires set during
the three-day rampage left dozens of families homeless.
   Police arrested 154 youths Monday night for violating the 6 p.m.
to 6 a.m. curfew, compared with 160 arrested during the first night
of the curfew last year, said police spokesman Officer John
Leavens. The curfew is for people under age 19.
   Tuesday, there were 71 curfew-violation arrests, said Officer
Allene Ray, adding that she didn't know how many fires there were.
``They're keeping that from us,'' Officer Thomas Martinelli said of
fire department officils.
   Public information numbers at the fire department rang
unanswered Tuesday night.
   Ray Wright, coordinator for block patrol Operation Get Down,
said it was quiet around his east-side neighborhood.
   ``Thank God for that. No fires. I'm driving around and we've had
no incidents. We've smelled smoke but not in our sector and we
haven't seen a fire,'' he said.
   But near his neighborhood, one house near the border of tony
Grosse Pointe Park burned Tuesday, said neighbor D.J. Hazebrook.
``It was a big red glow,'' he said.
   Nearby, a vacant house was blazing at 11 p.m., attracting at
least 70 spectators, some of whom recorded the event with
videocameras.
   There was no way to immediately determine if the fires were the
work Devil's Night arsonists.
   In one effort to keep would-be firebugs at home, the Southeast
Michigan Cable Association this year decided to unscramble TV
signals to non-subscribers. That made available Tuesday night's
cable offerings ``In Country'' with Bruce Willis, ``Gung Ho'' with
Michael Keaton, and ``The Muppets Take Manhattan.''
   To reduce the number of targets, the city knocked down about
5,000 abandoned homes during the fiscal year from July 1, 1989, to
June 30, according to the latest city records available.
   Mayor Coleman A. Young last week unveiled a ``My Heart Is with
Detroit'' campaign that urged residents to take pride in the city
and increase the number of anti-arson patrols.
   He said more than 35,000 residents and city workers volunteered,
many wielding fire extinguishers as they walked their streets and
alleys.
   ``The people are tired. They're the ones that are out there
making sure it doesn't happen again, and that's going to be the
difference this year,'' said Toni McIlwain, coordinator of three
Detroit neighborhood associations of 4,100 homes near City Airport
that united for Devil's Night patrols.
   ``People are tired of being scared,'' McIlwain said.
   Volunteers in the Barton-McFarlane Neighborhood Association of
20,000 residents have patrolled every year for six years, watering
down trash bins at sundown and removing from curbsides garbage and
old furniture that might tempt firebugs.
   Residents said they also hoped to put an end to Detroit's
tarnished image, which has drawn news crews from as far away as
Japan each year.
   ``We had a reporter from Tokyo Monday looking for what house and
what street would burn,'' said Joseph Walker Williams, president of
the Barton-McFarlane association.
   Detroit Firefighters Association President Robert Haig said
fires often are set by youths responding to the hype surrounding
Devil's Night.
   ``It's dangerous for firefighters. We don't need this. It's like
people come in and egg it on,'' Haig said.
   Neighboring communities and cities as far as Flint 50 miles
north also prepared for a fiery spillover from Detroit.
   Flint Assistant Fire Chief Ron Downing said about 140 fires were
reported in the city of 159,000 residents last year, catching the
city off guard. There are five fires on a typical night, he said.
   ``This year, we prepared for the worst,'' he said. The city
doubled its work force to 75 firefighters Tuesday night.

   President Bush says he still hopes the Persian
Gulf crisis will end peacefully but is consulting on options with
congressional leaders and foreign policy aides as the standoff with
Iraq nears the three-month mark.
   Bush summoned Democratic and Republican leaders to the White
House today, a day after he declared that he ``would have no
hesitancy'' about using force if provoked by Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein.
   The president also planned to meet with foreign policy advisers
today.
   The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war,
although the president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

   DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Along with the bullets, guns and
food the military needs to wage war, there's a precious commodity
that links the troops in Saudi Arabia to home - the mail, 70 tons a
day of it.
   But the system's becoming clogged with boxes of cookies, books,
newspapers and letters to ``any soldier'' from stateside
well-wishers, courtesy of ``Dear Abby'' campaigns and drives by
churches and schools.
   With Christmas around the corner, it's going to get worse.
   ``I think we're getting so much of it that it bogs down the mail

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal regulations that bar the staffs of
government-subsidized family planning clinics from discussing
abortion with their clients are coming under Supreme Court
scrutiny.
   Although fueled by the continuing struggle over abortion, the
legal dispute being argued before the court today more directly
involves free speech rights than women's rights to end their
pregnancies.
   At stake is the information available to the 5 million
low-income women who depend on family planning clinics and similar
health care providers.
   Federal regulations imposed by the Reagan administration in 1988
called for the ban on counseling about abortion, but court
challenges have kept the rules from being enforced virtually
everywhere.
   Several anti-abortion organizations are urging the justices to
use the family clinic case to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion.

   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Thousands of homeless and hungry Americans
are getting their daily meals from restaurants and caterers instead
of trash cans.
   At least 40 cities across the nation have launched programs to
put leftovers to use, according to Share Our Strength, a Washington
group that is waging a campaign to fight food waste.
   Prepared food left at the end of the day at deli counters,
banquets, restaurants and executive dining rooms is picked up and
distributed to shelters and soup kitchens.
   ``What's the point of throwing away all this wonderful food when
you could feed it to hunger relief agencies in your city?'' asked
Jennifer Hadley, coordinator of the campaign. ``These people are
hungry. And it's better to get food served from a catering company
than to pick it out of a trash can.

   DETROIT (AP) - The city imposed a curfew and organized patrols
by residents toting fire extinguishers, while free cable TV was
offered to keep firebugs home tonight during Devil's Night,
Detroit's pre-Halloween arson spree.
   The measures are part of an effort by Detroit to remake its
lawless image and end the annual outbreak of fires that has become
a national embarrassment.
   Devil's Night is actually three nights of vandalism, beginning
two nights before Halloween and peaking one night before.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - Troops shot to death a knife-wielding
Palestinian today in the West Bank, and an Arab died in a failed
bombing in a Tel Aviv suburb. Both incidents were apparently
attempts at revenge for the Temple Mount killings.
   A third attack occurred in Arab east Jerusalem, where a
Palestinian stabbed a policeman. The victim was lightly wounded and
the assailant arrested, police said.
   The attacks were the latest in violence set off by the police
response to the Oct. 8 riots on the sacred Temple Mount. Twenty
Palestinians were killed by police who opened fire on Arabs who had
pelted Jewish worshipers with rocks.
   Since the Temple Mount killings, five people have been killed
and 11 wounded in a series of revenge attacks by Arabs and
Israelis.
   ---&equals;
   AYODHYA, India (AP) - Troops opened fire today on Hindu
fundamentalists who broke through police lines and surged toward a
holy site claimed by both Hindus and Moslems. Four people were
killed and at least three wounded.
   The turmoil stems from plans by militant members of the
country's Hindu majority to build a temple on the contested site,
where a 16th century Moslem mosque stands.
   The dispute threatens to topple the government of Prime Minister
V.P. Singh, who opposes the Hindu campaign to replace the mosque.
   The name of this Hindu holy town has become a battle cry in
riots that have left at least 113 people dead across India this
past week. Most of the deaths occurred in clashes between Hindus
and Moslems.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The best way to discover ``My Talk Show'' is to
be an unwary late-night viewer who tunes in not quite sure of
what's happening.
   It sure looks like a talk show. There are couches at
conversational angles. There's a cast of regulars and there are
Celebrity Guests. But there's something vaguely screwy about the
show, something just slightly out of whack.
   ``We've been saturated by talk shows,'' said executive producer
Andrew Alexander, who also was a developer of ``SCTV,'' the
acclaimed comedy series. ``It seems logical now that everybody
should have their own talk show.''
   Our host for ``My Talk Show'' is homemaker Jennifer Bass. She
originates the live show from the living room of her home in Derby,
Wis. The studio audience sits on bleachers in her garage.
   Jennifer began her talk show career at Derby Junior College,
where she was host of ``Coed to Coed.'' After graduation she
married her high school sweetheart, but he left ``to search for his
identity.''
   Then her best friend and next door neighbor, Angela Davenport,
urged her to do ``My Talk Show.'' It aired on a cable access
channel, where it was seen by a visiting TV executive who put the
show into national syndication.
   The biography of Angela, Jennifer's co-host, says she rebelled
against her upbringing and joined the Hells Angels. ``Along the
way, Angela saw much of America and learned to strip and reassemble
a Harley-Davidson in 20 minutes.''
   Other regulars include Jennifer's semiworthless brother-in-law,
Marty Dissler, whose trailer is parked in her driveway, and Anne
Marie Snelling, the local dinner theater's leading lady and head of
the Chamber of Commerce.
   Ms. Bass introduces her guests, usually two or three local
celebrities and the Celebrity Guest, who talks of a current
Hollywood project or a hobby or personal cause. It sure looks like
a talk show.
   But something just doesn't ... feel ... right. Maybe it was the
segment with Derby's newly voted ``Bachelor of the Year,'' who
seems terribly insecure and slightly afraid of women.
   Maybe it was the eccentric neighbor who bursts into the room in
his undershorts, giggling hysterically and shouting that he's
dreaming that he's appearing on national television in his
underwear.
   As it turns out (ah, but you saw this one coming, eh?) the
syndicated ``My Talk Show'' is really one of the cleverest
situation comedies on TV. It airs late at a night in more than 100
markets, or about 90 percent of the country.
   It's the spiritual heir to ``Fernwood 2-Nite'' and ``America
2-nite,'' the late '70s' wildly alienated, sometimes offensive
parodies of late-night talk shows that were summer replacements for
``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.''
   Martin Mull and Fred Willard played a glib, egotistical talk
show host and his utterly stupid second bananna. Their talk show
interviewed other characters, usually grotesques of Hollywood
stereotypes.
   The difference with ``My Talk Show'' is that it actually is a
talk show. The Celebrity Guest is being interviewed by fictional
characters who are working out their lives on a talk show,
literally ``living up there.''
   Jennifer Bass actually is an actress named Cynthia Stevenson;
Stephanie Hodge plays Angela, and David Packer is Marty, the
brother-in-law.
   ``Those functional characters are constantly imploding into the
interviews,'' said Alexander. ``There's a certain structure to it,
but the questions are real.''
   The celebrities seem to enjoy it, said staff writer Debra
McGrath, an alumnus of the Second City improvisational troupe, who
plays Anne Marie Snelling and who co-created the show with Linda
Kash.
   They envisioned a talk show where the regulars were more wrapped
up in their own lives than in celebrities. ``A guest would have to
come on and deal with whatever was going on in their lives,''
McGrath said.
   A running gag in ``My Talk Show'' is its low budget, as when
Robert Goulet did the show and there was no money to pay the
royalties if he sang ``If Ever I Would Leave You.''
   ``But we do have a list of public domain songs,'' McGrath said,
lapsing helplessly into character. ``Robert Goulet sang `The Bear
Went Over the Mountain' and `The Itsy Bitsy Spider' with such
conviction.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   THE POLITICS OF ABORTION - ``Peter Jennings Reporting: The New
Civil War,'' an hourlong documentary airing at 10 p.m. Thursday on
ABC, takes a look at how abortion has become a political issue.
   The program examines ``how politicians and advocates attempt to
manipulate the public and how they themselves behave under pressure
when dealing with a subject as emotional as abortion,'' the network
said.
   ABC said ``Nightline'' would be pre-empted on Thursday for an
extended ``ABC News Forum,'' moderated by Jennings, from 11:30 p.m.
until 1 a.m. EST.

<HEAD>New Stock Market Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometime in the future, when bad news wanes and
investors have renewed confidence and shirts on their backs, a new
stock-market leader may emerge: small-company stocks.
   You might never guess that at the moment, because prices of
these same stocks have taken a far worse beating than the big blue
chips that make up some of the better known market averages.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which reflects those larger
stocks, has fallen about 17 percent from its high, but the Value
Line composite, viewed as a proxy for smaller stocks, has fallen 35
percent.
   The downturn for many smaller stocks has even quickened in the
past few weeks. Some, in fact, have lost half their market value,
even as earnings continue to grow.
   As a result, some conservative, long-term investors are loading
up on such shares or advising clients to consider them, reasoning
that growing companies might regain favor before blue chips.
   Business Week magazine quotes investment sage John Templeton,
who owns one of the prime long-term investment records, as saying
that in 50 years he has never seen shares of emerging growth
companies so grossly undervalued.
   Les Dimenstein, a broker with the Lanyi Division of Ladenburg
Thalmann, has seen some of his picks nosedive. ``When no one is
buying, we should be buying,'' he says, confident that people soon
will recognize good values and earnings.
   Wright Investors Service, which generally deals in blue chips,
commented this week that ``extraordinary values and opportunities
are being created in the small-capitalization sector.''
   Wright's thesis is that institutional and other large traders
have been seeking security in the so-called index stocks, those
that make up the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index.
   As a consequence, the popular, big-stock averages have remained
very much higher than smaller-stock indexes. In fact, investors who
pulled money from smaller stocks may have simply transferred funds
to bigger ones.
   While the bias toward large-capitalization stocks has gained
momentum this year, it is nothing new. Since mid-1983, the annual
return for the S&amp;P 500 has averaged 13 percent, the Value Line
index a mere 2 percent.
   Such results would appear to contradict a popular contention of
some market researchers, that considered as a whole, stocks with
small capitalizations are likely to outperform larger stocks. They
call it the small-company premium.
   Seemingly logical reasons are offered to explain this concept.
Smaller companies are difficult to research, and there are just too
many of them. Their small float, or shares available, may be
insufficient for big investors.
   Less well-known than the world of big companies, the universe of
small-cap stocks may include sleepers: Well-managed, fast-growing
companies with first-class products - companies destined someday to
become large enterprises.
   Many are entrepreneurial, perhaps still owned by the founder,
with a management team zealously pursuing a vision - living for the
company rather than living off it, as so often happens in larger,
bureaucratic concerns.
   Eventually, so goes the concept, some of these companies will
grow to a size that attracts the big investors. The money will poor
in, the company's price-earnings ratio will rise, and the early
investors will profit.
   Since 1983, of course, the small-company premium hasn't been
noticeable. Bigger stocks have grown faster than the small ones,
and more recently the shares of small companies have dropped more
sharply than those of giants.
   Still, say those who believe in the small-cap premium, it is far
from dead, and that from somewhere in that universe tomorrow's
leaders will emerge. ``No trend or fad continues ad infinitum,''
says Wright.

   In Germany, Ricky Morrow's plight is the stuff of
passionate demonstrations and letter-writing campaigns.
   But in Dallas, where he is awaiting the start Thursday of his
third murder trial for a killing he admits to committing, most
people don't even know his name.
   Morrow is being tried on capital murder charges in the January
1982 death of a security guard. He says the shooting occurred
accidentally while he was trying to rob First Texas Savings and
Loan.
   ``I'm not innocent of a crime. I'm innocent of capital murder,''
he says from his jail cell in Dallas. Under Texas law, a killing
during the commission of a felony can bring the death penalty.
   ``We are trying to do everything on our side to save Ricky,''
says Eva Marie Kaifenheim of Munich, Germany, who has orchestrated
a letter-writing campaign that has resulted in more than 200 notes
to members of the U.S. news media, officials and diplomats. The
letters accuse prosecutors of acting improperly in Morrow's case.
   Ms. Kaifenheim said she learned of the case through the human
rights organization Amnesty International, which employs her sister
and other family members.
   Last year, more than 500 demonstrators marched through the
Bavarian capital bearing placards saying, ``Life for Ricky
Morrow,'' Ms. Kaifenheim said.
   ``There are a lot of people here in Munich aware of what is
going on in Dallas,'' she said.
   Morrow's initial November 1983 capital murder conviction in the
death of Mark Frazier was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals in March 1988 because of an improper question posed to
prospective jurors. A second trial ended in a mistrial in July
1989.
   ``It was a complete accident, something I never intended to
happen,'' Morrow said of the shooting. ``I was drunk, I was on
psychiatric medication, I had just been released from a hospital
seven days before.
   ``In my own mind, I do not think that it would be any more wrong
for me to die than it was for him. ... He should be living today
and would be living today had I not gone out and got drunk and
decided to rob a bank. But I did and it happened.''
   But he questions the zeal with which he is being prosecuted,
noting that Dallas County prosecutors have never lost a capital
case since the death penalty was reinstituted in 1976.
   ``There's a reason they have never lost one,'' Morrow said.
``They will do anything.
   ``They're spending millions and millions of dollars just to get
a notch on their belt. That's what capital cases in Dallas County
are all about.''
   Chief Assistant District Attorney Norman Kinne confirms that his
office has won all 49 capital murder cases tried since 1976.
   Morrow, 39, of Houston, and Ms. Kaifenheim contend the district
attorney's office has resorted to perjured testimony, intimidation
of potential witnesses and other unethical acts to ensure the death
penalty.
   Ms. Kaifenheim rattles off the names of wrongfully convicted
inmates Randall Dale Adams and Lenell Geter, who were freed by the
courts amid allegations of misconduct by Dallas County prosecutors.
   Morrow said prosecutors refused a plea bargain that would have
kept him behind bars, without possibility for parole, until the age
of 70.
   Assistant District Attorney Dan Hagood, who is prosecuting
Morrow, declined to respond to the allegations.
   ``I can't talk about a pending case. Ethically, you are not
supposed to,'' he said. But he confirmed his office has received
letters from the Germans.
   Morrow's attorney, Keith Jagmin, also declined to discuss the
trial, which started in July with jury selection.
   Ms. Kaifenheim said she obtained the name of Morrow, who then
was on Texas' death row, and that of another death row inmate in
1987 from her sister, Antonie, who works with Amnesty
International.
   The human rights organization unconditionally opposes the death
penalty, said Alli Miller, Amnesty International USA's director of
programs against the death penalty.
   Amnesty members in one country are asked to ``adopt'' another
country. In this instance, Germany has ``adopted'' the United
States and protests U.S. death penalty cases, Ms. Miller said.
   But the action undertaken by Ms. Kaifenheim was at her own
behest, not the group's, she said. Amnesty International does not
become involved with capital cases until the defendant has been
sentenced.
   After obtaining Morrow's name and address, Ms. Kaifenheim sent
him a letter and a fruitcake for Christmas in 1987.
   ``Ricky wrote me saying he was very happy for the cake, but even
happier by the letter,'' she said in a telephone interview from
Munich conducted in German.
   ``She had also sent some other inmate the same thing and he
never responded. I did respond because it was something you don't
get in prison and I was moved by it,'' Morrow said.
   That initial contact sparked a correspondence that has
intensified over the years. Ms. Kaifenheim said that during a bleak
period a year or so ago when Morrow tried to take his own life, she
wrote him daily to boost his spirits.
   She plans on coming to Dallas when the trial begins.
   ``I will be in court each day,'' she said.
   Morrow said Ms. Kaifenheim's concern renewed his interest in
fighting for what he calls a fair trial.
   ``Her primary concern is the same as mine, that I get a fair
trial, and that's all I'm asking for,'' he said.

<DATELINE>GUAZAPA MOUNTAIN, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lalo, a bomb maker with one
arm, pressed a whittled, foil-sheathed plug through a tube wired to
a flashlight battery and tiny bulb. The bulb went on.
   ``Boom,'' Lalo said softly. ``There goes your foot.''
   The switch is designed to be buried and activated by a soldier's
footstep. It is one of dozens of devices leftist rebels have
improvised to make up for a shortage of commercial weaponry.
   Lalo, whose left arm was blown off by a mine, makes explosives
from various mixtures of nitrogen-rich fertilizer, ground charcoal
from the guarumo tree, powdered aluminum, ammonia, sulfur and
sawdust. For shrapnel, Lalo uses nails, glass, even stones.
   He and his assistant, Jorge, fashion their mines and mortar
shells on this extinct volcano 15 miles north of San Salvador with
the rudimentary tools of a traveling tinker.
   ``Everything we make is a copy of industrially manufactured
weapons,'' Lalo said.
   Five years ago, he lost his arm to the explosion of a homemade
mine he was digging up for relocation.
   ``Every amorer makes two mistakes,'' he told an interviewer,
stripping wire with his teeth: ``The first, when he gets into this
line of work; the second, when he gets creamed.''
   Details of government casualties are classified, but foreign
military attaches say homemade mines wounded more soldiers than
rifle fire in the 1980s.
   The most common guerrilla mine is the ``quita-pie,'' literally
``foot-taker.'' It is designed to maim rather than kill, and its
components cost about $2.
   Congress voted in October to halve U.S. military aid to El
Salvador, originally set at $85 million for the year.
   While Defense Minister Rene Emilo Ponce lamented the effect on
logistics and operations, Lalo and his colleagues were making bombs
of what seemed little more than chewing gum, baling wire, sticks
and spit.
   More than $1 billion in U.S. military aid in the 1980s swelled
the armed forces from 12,000 to 56,000 men and gave them
sophisticated weapons, including jet fighter-bombers, helicopters
and artillery.
   Rebel ranks are believed to have about 7,000 full-time
combatants and roughly the same number of militia fighters.
   They have received some arms, mainly assault rifles and
ammunition, from Cuba and Nicaragua since the civil war began in
late 1979, but generally rely on the black market and their own
ingenuity.
   Included in the arsenal are 35-pound bombs made from refillable
tanks of the propane gas Salvadoran workers use as cooking fuel. A
dozen such bombs, launched like mortar rounds from barrel-sized
pipes, were among projectiles that rained on the main air force
base in an attack Oct. 17.
   Guerrilla arms makers are scavengers who utilize what the enemy
throws away or inadvertently bestows.
   Bomb casings are made from ration cans discarded by army
patrols. Lalo has extracted as much as 200 pounds of Tritonal high
explosive from U.S.-supplied 500 lb. bombs that did not explode
when dropped on the slopes of Guazapa.
   Like Lalo and his arms makers, guerrilla doctors also
demonstrate great ingenuity.
   In 1982-83, the rebels on Guazapa were decimated by a malaria
epidemic. Pharmaceutical quinine was almost impossible to obtain
because of government offensives.
   The doctors extracted the alkaloid from the bark of the cinchona
tree, mixed it with cornmeal and sugar and pressed it into pills.
By early 1984, the disease was under control.
   Agusto, one of the doctors, recalled operating with a razor
blade and tweezers for lack of surgical implements. He learned to
modify a disposable syringe for tracheotomies and used the severed
fingers of rubber gloves to drain wounds of pus and blood.
   ``I've done several amputations with the saw blade of a Swiss
army knife,'' he said.
   Folk medicine based on herbs, sap, roots and bark is a mainstay.
   During the early 1980s, when their positions on and around
Guazapa were less stable and lines of supply more tenuous, rebels
recruited the local bootlegger to distill cane liquor into
hospital-grade alcohol.

<HEAD>Political Significance of Throne Grows as Coronation Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear that politicians are manipulating the throne
for their own ends has arisen again, more than 40 years after
Allied occupation forces rewrote the constitution to prevent it.
   This time, the warnings come from within Japan's own society as
the nation prepares for the coronation Nov. 12 of Emperor Akihito,
the first monarch to be enthroned under that constitution.
   ``I am very worried that the palace is being used for political
purposes just as the military used the late Emperor Showa
(Hirohito) before the war,'' Minoru Hamao, a former imperial
chamberlain, said in an interview.
   Hamao, who directed the education of the Akihito and his sons
for 20 years, said conservatives who would return to the old
imperial system are a minority within the governing Liberal
Democratic Party and lack public support.
   He added, however, that there was increasing evidence of
attempts by politicians ``to align themselves with the emperor
because they feel that will get them prestige and votes.''
   The Chrysanthemum Throne has been politically important
throughout Japanese history, but has had little to do with
day-to-day policy.
   It was used as a justification for their own power by feudal
samurai leaders, political reformers at the turn of the century and
militarists in the years leading up to World War II.
   Today, the Liberal Democrats, who have governed since their
conservative party was formed in 1955, use a logo similar to the
imperial chrysanthemum.
   According to Hamao, links between the palace and party were
relatively weak until Yasuhiro Nakasone, prime minister in the
mid-1980s, tried to strengthen his control of the Imperial
Household Agency that manages palace affairs.
   ``The Imperial Household Agency is officially under the
supervision of the prime minister's office, and since Nakasone they
have used their control over personnel (appointments) to gain
power,'' Hamao said.
   He expressed particular concern about politicians being involved
in an enthronement rite called the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering
Ritual.
   ``It is very inappropriate for the prime minister and other
government leaders to attend the Daijosai because of its religious
nature,'' Hamao said. ``Having the politicians there is an
imposition, and not in line with the constitution.''
   Hamao said the palace could not have kept politicians off the
guest list, which was strongly influenced by the prime minister's
office.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's government has acknowledged the
religious nature of the Daijosai, in which a new emperor has his
first communion with the gods of Shinto, Japan's state religion
until the war ended.
   It also has described the rite as an ancient tradition and
denied that state funding violates constitutional bans on
government support of religious activities.
   In Hamao's view, the decision to follow prewar precedent for
Akihito's coronation is an attempt to free the government and
Liberal Democrats from constitutional constraints on political
manipulation of the throne.
   If politicians are allowed to ignore those restraints for the
coronation, he said, they may seek to use the emperor in pursuing
their goals.
   Sadao Yamahana, a legislator and and senior member of Japan's
largest opposition party, the Socialists, said he believed the
handling of the coronation reflected a desire by conservatives to
restore some degree of the throne's old status.
   Yamahana said members of his party would not take part in the
Daijosai, ``a rite that is intended to make the emperor closer to a
god.''
   The Japan Federation of Bar Associations, several teachers'
unions and the National Christian Council of Japan have announced
their opposition to state support for the Daijosai.
   In the constitution, written by the U.S.-led occupation
authorities who ran Japan's government for seven years after the
surrender in 1945, the emperor is defined as the ``symbol of the
state and the unity of the people.''
   This largely ceremonial figure was to replace a sovereign called
``sacred and inviolable'' in the imperial charter of 1889.
   ``Most Japanese support the monarchy as it is in the
constitution, but because of memories of the war, we also have
rather complex feelings toward it,'' Yamahana said.
   About 2,500 dignitaries, including Vice President Dan Quayle and
Prince Charles of Britain areend the main
coronation ceremony.
   While Yamahana acknowledged the need to guard against possible
attacks by leftist radic expected to attals, he also said extreme security
could be
a means of expanding police powers.
   ``Police are planning what can only be seen as excessive
security, and in this way, too, though subtly, they are saying that
the emperor is not a regular person, he is like a god that needs
special treatment,'' he said.
   Before the war, Yamahana said, the police and government used
such thinking to justify silencing dissent. He added that his
father, a social activist, was arrested dozens of times ``in the
emperor's name.''
   Radicals have declared they will use whatever means available to
disrupt the enthronement, including violence. Tokyo police are
believed to be planning Japan's largest security operation,
possibly involvin
   The strategy of extending a contract, then canceling the
extension even while asking union members to report to work puzzled
some UAW members who said they were ready to strike if the talks
continued to drag.
   But a source close to the bargaining who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``A strike is just unthinkable.'' The UAW last
struck Chrysler in 1985.
   Chrysler workers, after hearing for months from their union
leaders that they would settle for nothing less than the GM-Ford
agreement, have been wearing buttons in past weeks reading,
``Pattern or Picket.''
   Among the main features of the pattern contract are income
guarantees for laid-off workers, pension increases and no change in
health care.
   The last two items could cause Chrysler the most problems.
Chrysler's ratio of nearly one retiree for every active worker is
much higher than GM's or Ford's.
   Consequently, Chrysler's health-care bill is higher than that of
the other automakers. The company said it spent about $684 million
in health care last year.
   In addition to Michigan, Missouri and Delaware, Chrysler has
plants in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, New York and Ohio.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - He was a farmer, storyteller and sometime oil
field worker. More than that, Hugh McDaniel was an institution in
the heart of Louisiana where Cajun French blends happily with
Southern drawls. And when he died the high and the low turned out
for a wake that lasted around the clock.

   He was no mover or shaker. He never
held public office and didn't have a lot of money. Yet, 400 people
made their way to the deep woods of central Louisiana to attend the
wake of the man they all knew as Mr. Hugh.
   They came to pay their respects to Hugh McDaniel, vegetable
farmer and story teller, who died at age 73.
   News of the wake had been broadcast throughout the day on KVPI
Radio in Ville Platte, in both French and English since this part
of the country represents the marriage bed of the Catholic-Cajun
and Protestant cultures.
   Illiterates mingled with university professors. Welfare
recipients chatted easily with a couple of oil millionaires. All
had been charmed by Hugh McDaniel, farmer and storyteller.
   Bo Goodman, for example. He doesn't own a car. He hitched a
ride.
   And William Leece, owner of an oil field service company, a
business in a frenzy due to the crisis in Iraq. He locked his
office for the day to attend.
   Maude King came. She lives so far back in the woods that even in
the 1960s some residents didn't have electricity.
   The wake lasted 24 hours with the kitchen of the Friendship
Baptist Church working around the clock, concocting steamy gumbo,
coffee thick enough to float a spoon and enough deserts to make a
fat man weep.
   Plates of Cajun sausage - boudin - were complemented by the
Protestants' traditional chicken and dumplings.
   As a drizzling rain fell constantly this autumn day, inside the
church one pew was filled with the Naquin family, cousins of
McDaniel, who conversed and prayed in French.
   A cousin from another branch of the family leaned over the pew
to speak to the Naquins. ``How're y'all,'' he drawle.
   Many sat all night in the church.
   The later services were conducted by four ministers, including
two Baptists, a Church of Christ lay preacher and a Catholic
priest. Organized religion is casual here.
   Hugh McDaniel symbolized that casualness. The son of a
French-speaking, Catholic mother, he went to the Baptist church as
a youngster simply because that church was closest to the farm.
Those were the days of mud roads and few autos. And time away from
the farm could mean a lost crop and a bare cupboard.
   And, typical of the 1920s, he spoke mostly French until he went
to school where teachers whipped those who didn't speak English.
Such attitudes nearly killed the Cajun culture, which was revived
in the 1960s. Now, French is taught in elementary school.
   Hugh McDaniel was not typical in other ways, this man who grew
vegetables and fruit on a few acres along Dun Beef Creek just north
of Pine Prairie.
   He was the kind of man that most of us, as youngsters, want to
emulate, but wind up in middle-age realizing with some self-pity
that we never made it.
   Mr. Hugh gloried in his God, his family, his fellow man and the
soil - in that order.
   People were naturally drawn to the warmth of a man who never met
a stranger.
   Over decades, word-of-mouth sent the message through several
parishes. There was a man in the woods growing anything that could
sprout. They came to buy. Discovering he was a storyteller,
customers sat under the pecan trees and listened. They left as
friends.
   He made the headlines of a local newspaper when he grafted a
domestic peach tree with a wild tree, developing a new strain of
the fruit.
   County agents and agriculture professors from the University of
Southwestern Louisiana heard of his delicious peaches. They
listened to accounts of how he grew crops that couldn't be
sustained in that part of the country where the frost came early.
   The experts traveled to the farm to see for themselves, to see
if he could grow satsuma oranges this far north. Could he really
grow kiwis? That couldn't be done in this climate. Surely, he
couldn't produce Vidalia onions which were grown successfully only
in a few Georgia counties.
   Ah, but he did all that. The professors also sat under the
trees, sipping iced tea and listening to Mr. Hugh's stories.
   He had little desire for material possessions but dutifully
worked the oil fields at times for the money that would give his
four children benefit of college educations.
   The farming wouldn't sustain those expenses because Mr. Hugh
wouldn't charge enough. On top of that, he gave away as much as he
sold, traveling the roads with food for the sick and the
out-of-work.
   The millionaire Leece met the farmer in the oil fields, totally
disarmed by a grimy, oil-spattered employee who treated the owner
like a fellow employee, wanting to chat during breaks.
   Leece found that he missed those chats and was drawn to the farm
once Mr. Hugh's college funding duties were over.
   With time on his hands, Mr. Hugh contributed columns to the
Ville Platte Gazette, sometimes featuring Jean Pierre with a Cajun
dialect. A simple man's view of the world, a bit of local history,
a humorous account of a personal experience.
   So, he's gone, taking with him the well-chronicled stories of
his wonder dogs, Revlon and Rich. We'll hear no more of friend,
Calabas, or jokes about the ``ole woman,'' his cherished wife,
Eudole, now 73. Spring won't bring another column of God's grace at
planting time.
   But, not to mourn. Mr. Hugh would be the first to say that
mankind is like the soil in a way, sprouting other storytellers.
Maybe they are out there now. Maybe his columns have inspired other
simple folk to take up the pen.
   As for the farm? Well, Jean Pierre said it all in one of his
columns:
   ``I believe when God made the world, he paused here at Dun Beef
Cove and gave it a few extra strokes just for me. I believe He
expects me to dress and keep it and realize that I am only a tenant
here for a short time and that I must pass this farm on to those
who come after me, just a little better than I found it.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - He first took to the piano at the age of 2,
started seriously studying at 6, and now this son of a piano
teacher is the talk of the music world. Meet Evgeny Kissin, a young
Russian on the move.

   On the day he turned 19, pianist Evgeny Kissin
listened to some tapes of his American recital debut, telephoned
his father in Moscow, and sat down at a piano to happily rip out
some ragtime.
   It was somewhat out of character for this serious young Russian
who rarely smiles on stage, even while taking bows to thunderous
applause. But he has reason to celebrate these days.
   Since he made his American debut with the New York Philharmonic
on Sept. 20, critics have been raving, saying Kissin is the kind of
exciting, expressive pianist who rarely comes along.
   That triumphant debut was followed with a recital at Carnegie
Hall on Sept. 30 and another recital in Chicago on Oct. 7.
   The music cognoscenti were eager to hear Kissin live, knowing of
him mainly through his recordings and word of mouth.
   The ``Live at Carnegie Hall'' record - Chopin, Liszt, Schumann
and Prokofiev, plus four encores - was rushed into a Nov. 20
release as a two-CD set by RCA Victor.
   Kissin, whose nickname is Genya, has recital debuts early next
year in Amsterdam, Paris and Milan. He will play with the Boston
Symphony at Tanglewood next summer and when he returns next fall
he's scheduled in Toronto, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Montreal, Boston and New York. He already is booked for spring 1992
by the Chicago Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra.
   It isn't always possible to tell whether a piano hotshot,
playing partly by youthful instinct, will stay on top in adulthood
or fade away. One knowledgeable, longtime observer of the classical
music scene said that when one has as much talent as Kissin, a big
career is confidently forecast.
   Harold Schonberg, writing in The New York Times, said,
``Musicians in general...tend to sound alike, products of an
assembly line age, playing without charm or any apparent affection
for the music under their fingers. Mr. Kissin has evolved his own
style, and it is a style that looks back to a period when a
controlled sonority, a singing line, power without banging, tempo
modification and poetry were what the great Slavic Romantic
pianists represented.''
   ``I never tried to make a special style in my playing,'' Kissin
says. ``I want to understand, what did the composer intend.
   ``Basically, my teacher's virtue is to develop what nature has
given me and never to dictate or enforce her own stylistic views.
She helps to guide and not let me go to extremes.''
   He has had the same teacher, Anna Pavlovna Kantor, since he
started at 6 at Moscow's Gnessin School for Gifted Children.
Actually, he took his first shot at playing the piano at age 2.
   Kissin doesn't smile on stage, he says, ``because I am inside of
the music. I am trying to be inside before I come on stage, because
it is necessary. Sometimes, after, I still feel inside the music.''
   Sometimes, on stage, he'll play something a bit differently than
ever before.
   ``This is not really experimenting. This is an inspiration that
comes,'' he says. ``If you really feel that you are totally in the
music and the mood is right for that, it'll just come out
naturally. If you're trying to do something different, very often
it would come out artificially.
   ``It is like discovering something, like looking at a painting
and all of a sudden seeing an aspect you never saw before and
trying to bring out that beauty.''
   As well as listening to recordings by Arthur Rubinstein and
Soviet pianists, Kissin listened to Van Cliburn. In 1958, when
Cliburn won the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow, Kissin says,
``My mother was very young. Cliburn was really an idol for her and
for people her age, so his records were in our house.''
   Kissin hasn't needed to enter competitions. He made his debut at
10, gave his first solo recital at 11 and performed two Chopin
concerti with the Moscow State Philharmonic at 12.
   He intends to add to the composers whose music he plays. ``I
will play Beethoven, I hope Ravel and Debussy, Mussorgsky, more
Schumann and Brahms.''
   And Kissin's world contains more than piano. ``I'm interested in
literature, history, politics, geography - Russian and the world.
   ``Glasnost should be good for artists. I think politics makes a
difference. Some artists have got the possibility to return like
Rostropovich and Kremer and Davidovich and Ashkenazy. Soviet
artists can move freer. I think it is normal that artists need new
impressions. And I think the feeling of freedom is in the
playing.''
   Kissin mentions seven gifted Soviet pianists about his age who
probably will be able to play in America now that cultural
relations have been re-established between the two countries.
   He was very nervous walking onto the Carnegie Hall stage, Kissin
says, but not because of the recent Cold War. ``When I was a little
boy, it was my dream to play in Carnegie Hall but I didn't think
too much about politics. Carnegie was a special name for me, like a
legend.
   ``It was for me a new step in my fortune. I was nervous like
never before.
   He hadn't been as nervous before playing with the New York
Philharmonic. ``It is easier when you have an orchestra.''
   Success is not going to his head. ``Adulation is nice when it is
from the heart,'' he says. ``Sometimes it is not very
intelligent.''
   Besides, not all his performances have been glamorous. ``I
played in East Berlin when I was 13, on my first trip abroad. My
first performance was in an opera house. The next morning I played
an upright piano, very bad, at a shipyard, for the workers.
   ``They liked it. They gave me a beautiful chess set.''
   He shakes his head no when asked whether he has a girlfriend.
``The art demands sacrifices,'' he says.
   Later he says he was kidding. ``I hope to have a normal life. I
think for an artist it's necessary, to have somebody to help and
share.''

   In her biography ``Call Me Anna,'' Patty Duke
tells how John and Ethel Ross took over her career as a child,
introduced her to alcohol and pills and subjected her to sexual and
emotional abuse.
   Still, Duke says, they had good intentions.
   ``I can't look at these people and say they're black-hearted
villains,'' says Duke, who plays herself as an adult in the film
version of her biography to be shown on ABC on Sunday. ``Their
intentions were good, but they got lost.''
   Under the Rosses' tutelage, Duke became a star of ``The Miracle
Worker'' on Broadway and at 14 became the youngest person to win an
Oscar for the movie version of the story of Helen Keller. Duke went
on to star in the television series ``The Patty Duke Show.''
   In the movie and in her 1987 biography, Duke tells how she
became manic-depressive after the Rosses separated her from her
family as a child, changed her name to Patty and told her, ``Anna
Marie is dead.''
   ``Bizarre though it may be,'' Duke says, she included the Rosses
in the dedication of the book, which she co-wrote with Kenneth
Turan. Both of the Rosses died several years before the book was
published.
   ``My intention in the book and the movie is to suggest very
strongly that these people had disturbed psyches of their own
rather than malicious intent,'' she says. ``I was abused by both of
them. He drank and she drank and took pills.
   ``They never thought this kid would be on Broadway or win an
Oscar. I think the fear of losing me affected them. I think because
of that fear they ended up driving me away.''
   Even after leaving the Rosses, Duke continued to suffer mood
swings and depression until she was diagnosed as a manic-depressive
and underwent treatment.
   The movie also stars Howard Hesseman as John Ross, Deborah May
as Ethel Ross, Ari Meyers as Duke as a child, Jenny Robertson as
Duke as a teen-ager and Millie Perkins as her mother, Frances Duke.
   Arthur Taxier plays John Astin, Duke's third husband, and Karl
Malden is Dr. Harold Arlen, the psychiatrist who helped her bring
her mental illness under control. Her brother, Ray Duke, plays
their father.
   Duke is married to Michael Pearce, a former Army sergeant she
met while filming ``A Time To Triumph.'' They divide their time
between Los Angeles and a home in Idaho.
   She recently left for Canada to work in a new CBS movie ``To
Cast a Shadow.'' Her son, Sean Astin, is in ``Memphis Belle'' and
is working on ``The Toy Soldier.'' Another son, MacKenzie Astin,
has been an actor and is now in school.
   Although she has won an Oscar and three Emmys, Duke says playing
herself was awkward.
   ``I couldn't use my usual system of acting,'' she says. ``I had
tremendous help from Gil Cates, the director and producer, who also
had his problems directing me. He said, `How can I tell you I don't
think she would have behaved that way?' What it all boiled down to
was an exercise of just doing my job and not trying to monitor it
all the time. I left that to Gil and all went well.
   ``Will people believe this outrageous behavior? It was very
real, out-of-control behavior.''
   Duke says re-creating the scenes was not painful because it had
been eight years since she had been treated and even longer since
some of the incidents happened.
   ``I think there was some embarrassment,'' she admits. ``I don't
think any of us like people to see the uglier parts of us. But I
never felt I was back there reliving any of it.''
   Duke is writing a second book that deals more directly with
depressive disorders. As with the first book, she is working with a
professional writer.
   ``There are a lot of textbooks, but this is an attempt to reach
a broader audience,'' she says. ``It allows me to talk about
diagnosis and treatment.''
   She says she did not know how people would react to publication
of her biography in 1987.
   ``I mean when you say good morning, I had an illness, you don't
know if you'll work again,'' she says. ``But it shows you can be
cured.
   ``In the beginning I didn't think it could be transferred to the
screen. Then I began to see a very important, very valuable avenue
to reach people. I wouldn't be living up to my own goal of helping
people if I didn't take advantage of television.''
   The movie presented some legal problems for ABC, which had to
decide who among the characters is and is not a public figure - and
obtain clearances from those still alive.

   Despite its success in New York in 1928,
``Machinal,'' an expressionistic drama written by Sophie Treadwell,
has been one of Broadway's lost plays.
   There were occasional productions over the years, including one
off-Broadway in 1960, and a script published in an anthology by
women playwrights in 1982. But the play and its feminist author
remained unknown to most theatergoers for some 60 years.
   Unknown, that is, until Michael Greif, a quiet, bespectacled
director with a shy smile and Harpo Marx hair, resurrected it this
fall at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater. He turned
``Machinal'' (pronounced mock-en-AHL) into a big hit with the
Public extending the play's sold-out run until the end of November
to accommodate the ticket demand.
   The play is based loosely on the sensational 1927 murder trial
of Ruth Synder, the first woman executed in the electric chair. She
and her lover were convicted of killing Synder's husband.
   Treadwell, a well-known journalist of her day who once obtained
an exclusive interview with Pancho Villa, embellishes on the
real-life story for theatrical effect. Her heroine, called Helen
Jones, is dehumanized by a stifling job, a greedy, grasping mother,
a loveless marriage and finally an ill-fated love affair. She is
society's victim, trapped by a gritty, dark and oppressive
environment.
   The 31-year-old Greif is part of a major change this season at
the Public Theater, where producer Joseph Papp has staged his own
in-house cultural revolution. JoAnne Akalaitis, earth mother of the
avant-garde theater troupe Mabou Mines, was named his artistic
associate.
   And Papp has allowed three young directors to produce their own
programs of plays at Public this year on budgets of $300,000 for
each director. Besides Greif, the directors chosen were George C.
Wolfe, author of ``The Colored Museum'' and ``Spunk,'' and David
Greenspan, who directed ``Kate's Diary'' at the Public last year.
   Greif first directed ``Machinal'' last year in an old framing
warehouse on West 16th Street for a theater company called Naked
Angels. Papp saw the production, liked it and wondered if Greif
wanted to come to the Public Theater.
   ``He asked me what is a very often-asked question at a directing
interview, which is, `If you could choose a season of plays, what
would you choose?' '' Greif recalls.
   ``Machinal'' immediately came to mind. The other two took a
little longer to find.
   ``I ended up choosing the two plays I was most burning to do -
apart from `Machinal,' '' Greif says.
   He picked Tony Kushner's ``A Bright Room Called Day,'' which is
set in Germany during the 1930s. The play, which already has been
done in California, London and Chicago, is about a kind of heroism,
Greif says. Performances begin in December.
   The third offering, ``Casanova,'' by Constance Congdon, was seen
by Greif in a reading at New Dramatists. The playwright is still
working on the play which naturally is about the world's most
celebrated lover. It opens next spring.
   Having his own season of shows is quite a heady experience for a
stage-struck kid from Brooklyn, Brighton Beach to be exact.
   Greif's father was an optician, his mother worked part-time as
an auditor for a life insurance company.
   Their son went to the theater a lot. Instead of going to high
school, he'd sneak off to matinees, usually musicals.
   ``The musical form was actually a form where American directors
did the most interesting and experimental work,'' Greif says.
   He directed in high school, putting together what he calls
``very idealistic, very crude original musicals.''
   He studied acting and directing at Northwestern University in
Illinois, but ended up in California for more courses on directing
with Beckett guru Alan Schneider at the University of California at
San Diego.
   Greif also worked as an assistant to director Des McAnuff, who
was just starting up a new theater program at the nearby La Jolla
Playhouse.
   He assisted McAnuff on the director's regional theater
productions of ``Big River,'' a musical version of ``The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn'' that eventually made it to Broadway.
   ``I supported myself for a couple of years directing `Big River'
tours,'' Greif says, including the Japanese and Australian
productions.
   ``Machinal'' was brought to Greif's attention three or four
years ago by Jodie Markell, who plays the leading role. The two
went to school together at Northwestern and always had talked of
working together.
   ``The play requires an ensemble that is willing to really be a
part of a fabric, a great whole, and be comfortable in working in a
stylized way,'' Greif says. ``The production works because it keeps
a fine line between a completely stylized approach and also a very
human approach. It dances back and forth.''
   Does he have any more lost plays waiting to be discovered?
   ``They are still lost,'' Greif laughs. ``I'd like to uncover
more, but I'm too busy. That's the joy of being an unemployed
director. You have more time to find them.''

   ``John Sheppard: Media Vita'' (Gimmell) - The Tallis Scholars,
directed by Peter Phillips.
   ``John Sheppard: Church Music'' (Hyperion) - The Sixteen,
directed by Harry Christophers.
   ``Orlando Gibbons: The Cries of London'' (ADDA) - The Ensemble
William Byrd and the instruments of The Occasional Byrd, Graham
O'Reilly conducting.
   ``The Golden Age of English Cathedral Music'' (ASV) - Winchester
Cathedral Choir, Martin Neary conducting.
   
   John Sheppard seems to have begun his musical career in Oxford
in the 1540s and disappeared from the scene in London around 1560.
The dates of his birth and death are unknown.
   ``It is always unfortunate when there are no firm dates of birth
and death for a composer, since it is then impossible to have
anniversary celebrations for him,'' Peter Phillips drily observes
in the notes to the Tallis Scholars recording.
   Sheppard's music was a late addition to the early music revival
simply because the tenor parts of most of his composition had been
lost, and weren't restored until the 1970s. In any case, composers
are less in need of contrived anniversary concerts than of decent
performances of their music, and here Sheppard is well served.
   There is little to choose between the two recordings. Three cuts
are duplicated, and four singers appear on both discs.
   The Tallis Scholars' sound is warmer and more intimate while the
larger ensemble of The Sixteen sings with a churchly grandness.
   If one must choose, the nod goes to The Sixteen because of the
inclusion of one of Sheppard's loveliest compositions, ``In pace in
idipsum'' (``In very peace will I lie down''). The music blossoms
confidently and gloriously from a bud of plainchant, a small
masterpiece of simplicity.
   Unlike Sheppard, Orlando Gibbons was never forgotten in his
native England. At least some of his music - notably the majestic
``See, See the Word is Incarnate'' - has been continuously in the
English cathedrals' repertoire for more than three centuries.
   That anthem is among the high points of the new French recording
by the Ensemble William Byrd and its viol consort, The Occasional
Byrd. It's the best Gibbons recording now available - splendidly
performed, generously annotated and spanning the range of the
composer's output.
   Most striking is a puckish performance of ``The Cries of
London,'' seven minutes of Elizabethan sales pitches such as ``will
ye buy my dish of eels'' and ``hard onions, hard.''
   The Winchester Cathedral Choir's 1983 collection, recently
reissued on a compact disc, features a consort of viols and perhaps
the best of the boy-choir recordings of Gibbons' much-loved ``This
Is the Record of John.'' Gibbons' ``See, See,'' William Byrd's
``Laudibus in Sanctis,'' Thomas Tallis' ``Salvator Mundi'' and
Thomas Weelkes' ``Hosanna to the Son of David'' round out the
joyful noise.

   ``Music From Graffiti Bridge'' (Paisley Park-Warner Bros.) -
Prince
   
   The first four songs on Prince's new album sound like a
dictionary of pop music. There's rollicking rock (``Can't Stop This
Feeling I've Got''), a dance-floor anthem (``New Power
Generation''), bawdy rap (``Release It'') and a grinding ballad
(``The Question of U'').
   It's a record collection's worth of styles on one disc. All four
tunes are terrific, and they make more disappointing what follows:
funk. Technofunk. Lite funk. Teeny-bopper funk. Formula filler
funk. Most of all, forgettable funk.
   Prince's mistake may have been to rely heavily on guest
performers. Three of the weakest songs among the record's 17 cuts
were performed by The Time; another features singer Mavis Staples,
who sounds good but gets stuck with a numbing tune. ``Music From
Graffiti Bridge'' is to accompany Prince's upcoming new movie, and
the guest performances make it sound like a tepid soundtrack album.
   Prince saves his best compositions to sing himself, and there
are a few gems down the stretch - the Broadway-tinged ``Graffiti
Bridge,'' the steamy ``Joy in Repetition'' and the
psychedelica-gospel hybrid ``Still Would Stand All Time.''

   Chrysler Corp. reported a $214
million third-quarter loss, a performance that would have been
worse without record earnings at the company's financial
subsidiary.
   The earnings report on Monday, which showed Chrysler did better
by loaning money than by building and selling cars, underscored its
difficulties as the No. 3 Detroit automaker negotiates with the
United Auto Workers to reach a new contract. The UAW instructed
members to report to work even though the contract expired at
midnight.

   Moody's Investors Service said tax initiatives in Colorado,
Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, Oregon and Utah could, if
approved, lower the confidence financial advisers have in those

   NEW YORK (AP) - American Express Co. has taken a swipe at AT&amp;T's
popular Universal credit card with a broad marketing strategy that
enables customers to easily charge calls using the MCI and Sprint
long-distance companies.
   The ``Connect Plus'' package of services, announced Monday, lets

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Congress' refusal to provide more money for
savings and loan bailouts will delay the closing of failed

   Stock prices fell Monday as traders found little inspiration in
Congress's passage of a federal budget plan. The Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials tell 5.94 to 2,430.20.
   Bond prices also fell for the same reason. The price of the
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell about $6.25 per $1,000 in
face amount and its yield rose to 8.83 percent from 8.77 percent
late Friday.
   Elsewhere, the dollar rose against most key currencies, gold

<HEAD>SEC Tells Mutual Funds to Change Misleading Names, Advertising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week after telling mutual funds to do a
better job of explaining the risk in high risk junk bonds, federal
regulators now want mutual funds to do whatever it takes to
eliminate any suggestions they are insured by the government.
   In a letter to all 3,500 investment companies registered with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC officials stated a new
get-tough policy that calls on funds to change their names, if
necessary, to protect investors from even inadvertent confusion.
   ``Funds that currently have names using such terms as
`guaranteed' or `insured' in conjunction with words such as `United
States' or `U.S. government,' should take immediate action to
remove those words from their names,'' said the letter signed by
SEC Enforcement Division Director William R. McLucas and Gene A.
Gohlke, acting director of the investment management division.
   It was the second time this month the SEC has urged changes in
the mutual fund industry. Last week the SEC asked junk bond mutual
funds to better explain the risks involved in such investments.
   The latest letter said funds should refrain from using terms
implying government protection in their titles and warned that
sanctions might be imposed ``against any fund that continues to use
terms in its name or that advertises its securities'' in such a
way.
   The Oct. 25 letter, made public by the SEC Monday, stated that
even mutual funds that invest a majority of their assets in U.S.
government securities - which are guaranteed - are not themselves
guaranteed or insured by the government.
   ``Recently there have been some advertisements that play up
names of the funds with `government guaranteed' something or
other,'' Gohlke said in a telephone interview. ``We're concerned
the names of the funds may give the unsophisticated investor the
idea that the U.S. government is guaranteeing the fund shares
themselves, which is not the case.''
   He said there were at least 20 or 30 funds using the offending
terms in some form that the SEC considers possibly misleading, but
he declined to identify any by name.
   L. Erick Kanter, a spokesman from the Investment Company
Institute, a Washington-based trade association for 2,900 mutual
funds, said the group had no immediate comment on the SEC letter.
   But a preliminary check of the ICI's rolls turned up only about
18 funds investing in Treasury bonds or other government securities
that used the term ``guaranteed'' in their name, he said, adding
that ammounted to ``well under 10 percent'' of the association's
member funds.
   The letter warning about implied government protection said
funds seeking to register with such titles could expect SEC
roadblocks delaying or preventing their sale to the public.
   Asked if the letter stemmed from problems encountered in the
savings and loan debacle, Gohlke replied ``I can't say `No,' but
we've had this concern for some time.''
   Some thrift customers lost their life savings when they bought
securities such as junk bonds sold at savings and loans, which
later failed. They wrongly assumed their investment was insured by
the government like thrift deposits were.
   Gohlke said the SEC had set no deadline for compliance on the
government protection, but warned ``that they should take immediate
action.''

<HEAD>American Express Announces Broad New Phone-Charge Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. faces a big
new challenge to its popular Universal phone-credit card, but the
long-distance giant immediately dismissed the entry from American
Express as ``a repackaging of old ideas.''
   American Express's new ``Connect Plus'' package of services,
announced Monday, enables customers to easily charge calls using
the MCI and Sprint long-distance companies. With it, cardholders
can make long-distance calls by punching in their account number.
Customers can get 10 percent discounts on most MCI and Sprint calls
made using the American Express card.
   The program, fully available to Sprint users Thursday and MCI
users Jan. 1, is the latest response by a financial services firm
to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s unexpectedly successful
entry into the credit card business last March.
   Since AT&amp;T began offering Visa and Mastercard services to
customers - with a 10 percent discount on all charged long distance
calls - the long distance phone giant says it has opened about 3.6
million Universal accounts and distributed about 6 million cards.
   With 70 million long-distance customers, AT&amp;T's entry into the
highly competitive and profitable credit card industry has raised
fears among U.S. banks and financial companies that they could lose
business. By adding the convenience of long-distance calling to
existing services, these firms are hoping to simply retain
customers, observers say.
   ``AT&amp;T's the bogey man here for everyone,'' said David
Robertson, vice president of The Nilson Report, a credit-card
industry newsletter published in Santa Monica, Calif. New entries
like American Express's are ``a way to increase value of existing
cards and maintain customers.''
   In June Citibank, the nation's largest credit-card issuer,
enlisted MCI to help launch a competitor to AT&amp;T's card. The cards
allow users to charge long-distance telephone calls via Visa or
Mastercard.
   American Express, trying to differentiate itself, said a key
advantage of ``Connect Plus'' is that full details about MCI and
Sprint long distance phone calls such as date and number called
show up on the cardholder's monthly bill.
   Billings for Visa and MasterCard programs show total phone
charges as a one-line item, but MCI subsequently sends callers
separate bills that itemize calls.
   At-home calls that appear on AT&amp;T's Universal card bill are
charged at a calling card rate as opposed to lower direct-dial
rates, although the 10 percent discount narrows the difference.
   An AT&amp;T spokesman dismissed American Express' cost advantage,
saying the card's annual fee swallows savings for calls made at
home. Charter membership in the Universal card is free.
   ``We don't see what's being offered by MCI and Sprint as
anything new,'' said the spokesman, Bruce Reid. ``This looks like a
repackaging of old ideas.''
   While American Express aides declined to discuss sales goals,
industry expert Robertson said he expects that 20 percent to 25
percent of the company's 26 million subscribers will sign up as
members of the new program.
   American Express is backing its new service with a direct mail
campaign, via the monthly newsletter sent to all cardmembers.
American Express also will make selective mailings to customers
deemed likely to sign up.
   The company may consider broader advertising of Connect Plus
later, said Norma Arnold, senior vice president of membership
marketing at American Express Travel Related Services Co.
   Robertson said American Express is likely to woo cardholders to
the service because of its success as a direct-mail marketer and
its high percentage of corporate card customers, who make a
disproportionately large number of the nation's long distance
calls.
   However, the new entry should intensify overall competition in
the card business.
   ``There's going to be a shakeout alright. You have consolidation
going on even as we speak,'' said Bruce Brittain, president of
Brittain Associates Inc., an Atlanta-based research and consulting
firm specializing in financial services. ``Some of the regional and
local issuers arund the country are getting out of business.''

<HEAD>Worried Accountants Can Talk Ethics on Hotline</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An accountant pressured to give too rosy a
picture of company finances or ignore the boss' big spending may
feel there is nowhere to turn for advice.
   But there is, say counselors operating a nationwide ``ethics
hotline'' for the National Association of Accountants.
   ``There is often a thin line between what's appropriate and
what's inappropriate,'' said counselor Howard Siers. ``We don't
tell them what to do. We talk through their problem. We are kind of
a sounding board for them.''
   Siers, a retired auditor from Tucson, Ariz., helps field phone
calls to 1-800-6-ETHICS, which is intended for NAA members only.
   With 100,000 members nationwide, the group is a professional
organization for corporate staff accountants.
   Robert Sweeney, an accounting professor at Memphis State
University, said he fields 15 to 20 calls a month to the hotline.
   ``There are so many people out there who have these ethical
problems and they don't have anyone to talk to,'' he said. ``Having
someone to reason it out with you is such a relief.''
   Hotline counselors keep no permanent records of the calls they
handle nor do they ask a caller his name or the name of his
company, Sweeney said Monday.
   The idea is to help accountants decide on their personal
actions, not to report the questionable ethics of their companies.
   ``Sometimes people will say that it looks like the only recourse
they have is resigning,'' Sweeney said.
   A common dilemma for accountants seeking advice is being
pressured to ``smooth the books,'' thereby making the company
appear more profitable than it really is, he said.
   ``The boss will want to delay recording expenses so the
financial statement for a period looks better,'' Sweeney said.
   An accountant faced with breaking the law generally has little
trouble figuring out his options, Siers said, but grey areas
involving ethics can be tough.
   The boss' personal expense claims when apparently excessive can
cause such problems.
   ``An accountant has an obligation to review (such claims) with
the person he or she reports to. But do you take it to a higher
level?'' said Siers, a retired general auditor for the E.I. du Pont
de Nemours &amp; Co.
   Siers said he has handled some 40 calls since the hotline opened
last spring. Many of those calls, he said, have come from employees
of smaller companies who have no colleagues they can speak with
openly.
   The callers are often upset when they phone but then calm down
after talking for awhile, Siers said.
   ``You can sense that they know then what they're going to do,''
he said.

   The United Auto Workers union,
hoping to avoid wildcat strikes at Chrysler Corp. plants, told its
members Monday to report to work as usual even if it cancels a
once-extended contract.
   The union and the No. 3 automaker continued to bargain early
Tuesday on a new national labor contract involving 63,000 hourly
and salaried workers in eight states after a midnight contract
extension cancellation had passed.
   ``Everything is under control at the present time,'' UAW Local
1183 President Richard McDonaugh Jr. at Chrysler's Newark, Del.,
assembly plant said Monday afternoon. ``They're dissatisfied with
the lengthy period of time the extension has been.''
   The current contract, negotiated in 1988, was extended past its
original Sept. 14 expiration while the UAW bargained separately
with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. New three-year
contracts are in place at those companies.
   The union gave Chrysler notice Friday that the contract
extension would expire at midnight Monday.
   During bargaining Sunday, UAW President Owen Bieber reportedly
rose from his chair and shouted at Anthony St. John, Chrysler's
vice president for employee relations.
   ``If you want a strike, you'll get it,'' Bieber reportedly told
St. John, Chrysler's chief bargainer. The Detroit News reported the
outburst in Monday editions attributed to an unidentified union
negotiator.
   Chrysler, meanwhile, said it lost $214 million during the third
quarter. Most of the loss was attributed to one-month retooling
shutdowns at two minivan plants, which make some of the company's
most profitable vehicles, and to cash rebates and low-interest
financing deals used to attract buyers.
   The blow was softened by record profits reported by its
financial subsidiary. Chrysler Financial Corp., which handles
consumer car loans, earned $83 million in the third quarter.
   Despite the lifting of the contract extension, union leaders
told members to report to work until notified otherwise. The UAW
scheduled a meeting Thursday in Detroit of its 200-member national
Chrysler bargaining council.
   ``At that time, a tentative agreement or a report on the status
of the negotiations will be presented,'' a union statement said.
However, the bargaining council also may discuss strike strategy,
union spokesman Bob Barbee said.
   ``We'll back our international (officers) as long as we can, but
if they don't give us something, we're out of here,'' said Phil
Portwood, a UAW member at Local 110 in St. Louis, home of one of
the two minivan plants.
   He said his local already had made strike signs and developed
picket schedules. ``We're ready to go,'' Portwood said.
   The UAW last struck Chrysler in October 1985 for 12 days.
   Major provisions of a new contract remained unresolved Monday,
including job security, health-care provisions and retiree
benefits.
   The UAW is pressing Chrysler to sign a contract similar to the
GM and Ford agreements. Chrysler officers have said the company may
not be able to afford certain provisions of the pattern agrement.
   Last week in Canada, Chrysler's wholly owned subsidiary agreed
to follow a pattern for Canadian Auto Workers that was set at Ford
and GM subsidiaries.
   When bargaining began in mid-July, Chrysler also said it needed
help from the UAW to cut health-care expenses, which cost the
company about $684 million last year. The pattern agreement has no
change in health-care provisions.
   In addition to Michigan, Missouri and Delaware, Chrysler has
plants in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, New York and Ohio.

   Unocal Corp. is taking advantage of higher
oil prices caused by the Middle East crisis to drill new oil wells
in the United States and Canada.
   Unocal will spend $33 million to drill 93 new oil wells this
year in North America, including 20 in California, said John F.
Imle, Jr., senior vice president for energy resources.
   ``These projects were in the inventory and had not been funded
simply because we didn't have the cash,'' Imle said Monday. ``That
cash is now available because of higher crude oil prices.''
   The new drilling originally was set to begin next year. It will
allow Unocal to increase net production of crude and other products
by 5,700 barrels a day, or 2.4 percent above 1989 levels.
   Unocal joins a growing list of companies that have benefited
from rising oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug.
2.
   Chevron Corp., Conoco Inc., British Petroleum and Atlantic
Richfield Co. also stepped up oil production in North America.

<HEAD>Japan's Auto Exports Fall 4.9 Percent In September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's vehicle exports fell 4.9 percent in
September from year-earlier levels and slipped 3.7 percent in the
first six months of the fiscal year, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association reported Tuesday.
   Japanese manufacturers exported 509,155 cars, trucks and buses
in September, the association said.
   Exports to the U.S. and European Community fell in September
while exports to most other areas, particularly Asia, were up. Over
the last several years, Japanese auto makers have invested heavily
in factories located in the large North American and European
markets. As they have come on line in the U.S. and the U.K.,
exports to both regions have fallen.
   In addition, an association official said, weakness in the U.S.
economy is depressing the market for automobiles and trucks in that
country and holding exports down. In contrast, fast economic growth
in Southeast Asia is multiplying exports to the region.
   Automakers shipped 134,827 units to Europe in September, up 2.8
percent from a year earlier. But exports to the 12 members of the
European Community were down 7.4 percent to 88,392 units.
   Exports to the United States totaled 207,762 units in September,
down 12.7 percent from a year earlier.

   South Korea's Tobacco and Ginseng
Corp. has concluded a deal to export 5 million packs of Korean-made
cigarettes to the Soviet Union next month, officials of the
state-run corporation said Tuesday.
   The officials said the deal was made in Moscow between Hong
Doo-pyo, president of the Korean corporation, and Moscow Mayor
Gavril Popov over the weekend.
   The officials declined to disclose further details, including
price.
   The deal also calls for both sides to study ways to set up a
joint venture cigarette factory in the Soviet Union, they said.
   Earlier this year, the U.S.-based tobacco makers Philip Morris
International Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc.
announced separately they had concluded deals to send more than 34
billion cigarettes to the Soviet Union.
   At the time, the companies described the Soviet Union as the
third largest cigarette market in the world.
   A shortage of cigarettes dreove unhappy smokers into the streets
of many Soviet cities this past summer.

   The stock market was little changed in early
trading today as the market digested better-than-expected economic
figures.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 4.70 to 2,434.90
as of 10 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues were barely ahead of decliners in the early
going, with 473 stocks up, 431 down and 427 unchanged on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.95 million shares after the
first half-hour of trading.
   Analysts said the market was searching for a direction following
the release of third-quarter gross national product figures. The
Commerce Department said the economy grew at an annual rate of 1.8
percent during the July-September period, a stronger than expected
showing.
   Much of the increase was due to consumer spending, which was
boosted by higher sales of cars and trucks.
   Analysts said the stock market was trying to determine how the
figures might affect interest rates. The Federal Reserve is less
likely to nudge rates lower if the economy appears to be expanding.
   Among blue chip issues, Philip Morris rose { to 46&rsqb;, General
Electric was unchanged at 50~, and General Motors was off \ to 36}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.20 to 165.44. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index fell 0.19 to 288.60.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a 5.94
loss at 2,430.20.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 481 up, 1,030 down and 453 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 133.98 million shares, against 130.19

   ``Why are police helping the publisher? The News is our enemy
and I resent the city helping our enemy,'' said George McDonald,
president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group
for the unions at the newspaper.
   ``Our position is that there are too many officers being
deployed - you have five officers for every picket.''
   Police Commissioner Lee Brown said earlier Monday, ``We're not
going to take sides in any job action. Our job is to enforce the
law.''
   About 200 officers are assigned to strike-related duties during
the day, Brown said.
   The News said in today's editions that 45 of the 350 Guild
members in its editorial department returned to work on Monday. In
all, the Guild represents about 750 reporters, editors,
photographers, clerks and business department employees.
   Barry Lipton, president of The Newspaper Guild, said ``a few''
members had gone back to work Monday.
   The News also said hundreds of permanent replacements were hired
throughout the paper and 24 temporary editorial staffers are on
loan from the Tribune Co., the parent company, which also has
papers in Chicago, Virginia and Florida.
   The News distributed 906,000 copies of its Monday edition,
according to spokeswoman Lisa Robinson.
   But ``due to widespread vandalism to newspapers once they are
delivered to newsstands, the Daily News may be unavailable at some
locations,'' Daily News executive John Sloan said in a statement.
   Sloan said strikers were threatening vendors, messing up
newsstands where the paper is sold and stealing bundled papers off
the streets.
   ``I'm not aware of that,'' said Mike Alvino, head of the
drivers' union. ``I myself have gone to dealers in my neighborhood
and said to them in a nice way, `Please do not buy the News.' ''
   Workers at several newsstands said club-wielding strikers
destroyed papers and threatened violence if they persisted in
selling the tabloid, which before the strike was the nation's
second-largest metropolitan daily.
   Strikers have vandalized delivery trucks and buses carrying
replacements to work. About 20 strikers have been arrested since
the strike began Thursday, most on disorderly conduct charges.
   Union leaders on Monday called for a boycott of Daily News
advertisers.
   Circulation difficulties prompted the discount appliance chain
Newmark &amp; Lewis to cut some advertising. Alexander's, a department
store company, promised to maintain its advertising level in
support of management.
   Nonunion editors and reporters from other papers operated by the
News' parent company began arriving for work Monday, helping the
skeleton crew of management employees that produced the paper after
the strike began.
   The Tribune Co. also operates newspapers in Chicago, Virginia
and Florida.
   Nine of the 10 unions at the paper went on strike last week
after 10 months of talks on contracts that expired in March.
   The 71-year-old tabloid lost about $115 million in the past
decade and circulation has slipped by about 700,000 since 1980. The
paper recently lost its standing as the nation's largest
metropolitan daily to The Los Angeles Times.

<HEAD>Third Quarter GNP Up 1.8 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a
stronger-than-expected 1.8 percent annual rate in the third
quarter, the government said today, continuing the longest
peacetime expansion in U.S. history.
   The Commerce Department said the growth in the gross national
product - the nation's total output of goods and services -
improved over a barely perceptible 0.4 percent annual rate during
the second quarter.
   The figures indicate the economy evaded the beginning of a
recession. But that isn't certain because the GNP report will be
revised twice - in November and again in December - as more
information becomes available.
   Nevertheless, Commerce Undersecretary Michael R. Darby told a
news conference: ``This release contradicts those who believe we
are in a recession or are about to enter one. We expect the economy
to continue to expand at a modest pace for the remainder of the
year and in 1991.''
   In another report, the government said sales of new homes
slumped 6 percent in September, the ninth decline in the past 12
months and the worst drop in half a year.
   Much of the improvement in the economy resulted from a 3.6
percent increase in consumer spending. Purchases of automobiles
rose $3.4 billion, compared to a $6.1 billion decline in the second
quarter, the Commerce Department said.
   In advance of the report, a consensus of economists had expected
a growth rate of 0.8 percent from July through September.
   But many analysts believe the economy has weakened in recent
weeks and is slipping into a recession, generally described as at
least two quarters of negative growth.
   Some economists say a recession actually began in the third
quarter, but others point to signs of continued growth from July
through September.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said Monday that while some
parts of the economy are in ``bad shape ... we're in a period of
slower growth'' but not a recession.
   The department also said that a GNP measure of inflation rose to
4.1 percent in the third quarter. It was the first GNP report since
the Persian Gulf oil-price shock pushed up the price of many
consumer goods.
   GNP inflation had slowed to 3.9 percent in the second quarter
from 6.4 percent in the first.
   In addition to consumer spending, the department said
third-quarter economic growth was fueled by a 7.4 percent increase
in business investment.
   On the other hand, that activity was partially offset by a $1.7
billion decline in inventories and a $7.9 billion merchandise trade
deficit.
   Housing construction was off 15.4 percent and federal government
spending, was down 0.3 percent.
   Second-quarter growth originally was reported to have been 1.2
percent at an annual rate. It remained unchanged in the first
revision but was revised sharply downward to just 0.4 percent in
the second. First-quarter growth was 1.7 percent.
   The economy grew 2.5 percent for all of last year, although it
slowed to a meager 0.3 percent rate in the fourth quarter. It had
expanded 4.5 percent in 1988.
   The total GNP, the broadest measure of the nation's economic
activity, was growing at an annual rate of $4.17 trillion in the
third quarter,when adjusted for inflation. That was a gain of $18.5
billion over the second quarter.
   In this month's survey of 52 economists by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators, a consensus said the ``GNP is now expected to contract
on an annualized basis in both the fourth quarter of 1990 and the
first quarter of 1991, providing us with the generally accepted
definition of a recession.''
   ``Fourth quarter GNP is expected to fall at an annualized rate
of 0.6 percent,'' wrote Robert J. Eggert, the Sedona, Ariz.,
publication's editor. ``The expected contraction in the first
quarter of 1991 GNP is put at 0.1 percent.''
   For all of 1990, the consensus forecast of the Blue Chip
economists calls for growth of 1.0 percent. The economy grew 2.5
percent last year, slowing from a 4.5 percent pace in 1988.
   ``Higher oil prices resulting from fears of a military conflict
in the Persian Gulf, the higher taxes and reduced spending that
will come with adoption of a budget-deficit reduction plan and
sharp declines in both consumer and business confidence were
cited'' for the weakening economic forecast, Eggert said.
   The Conference Board, a New York research group, reported last
Friday that consumer confidence in the economy plunged in October
to the lowest level since the 1981-82 recession. It said its index
tumbled more than 24 points, the biggest one-month drop in the
20-history of the survey.
   Since the last recession, the economy has grown for 95 months
through September, surpassing the previous peacetime growth record
of 58 months between 1975 and 1980. The current over all record was
106 months from 1961 to 1969, which included the Vietnam War.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rise in Modest Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a
modest rebound from recent losses.
   Soybeans were leading the grain markets higher following an
Agriculture Department announcement late Monday of a large sale of
U.S. and foreign soybeans to unknown destinations.
   The announcement sparked speculation of renewed demand for U.S.
grains, analysts said.
   The early gains were limited by perceptions that Indian summer
weather in the nation's midsection is pushing the corn and soybean
harvest along and helping the newly planted winter wheat crop.
   In a weekly report released late Monday, the USDA said 72
percent of the U.S. soybean crop and 64 percent of the corn crop
had been harvested as of Sunday.
   The agency said 86 percent of the winter wheat crop was planted
as of Sunday.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.62\ a bushel; corn
was } cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $2.29} a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1 cent higher with December at $1.20 a bushel;
soybeans were \ cent to 3{ cents higher with November at $5.93{ a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher and pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .17 cent higher with December at
77.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent
higher with November at 87.32 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to
.23 cent lower with December at 51.22 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .55 cent to 1.17 cents lower with February at 59.90
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Monday. Pork futures
fell sharply.

<HEAD>Businesses Expect Continued Growth Next Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German businesses expect continued growth
next year despite rising oil prices and pressure on exports, the
national chamber of commerce said Tuesday.
   More than 90 percent of the 17,000 German businesses surveyed
said they expect 1991 to be as good as this year, while 39 percent
predicted business will be better. Only 9 percent expect the
economy to be worse, the survey shows.
   Franz Schoser, managing director of Germany's association of
chambers of commerce, predicted the country's growth rate next year
will be between 2 and 3 percent.
   The chamber said businesses are optimistic about the expected
benefits of removing European Community trade barriers in 1993, as
well as greater access to Eastern Europe.
   The optimism persists despite less demand for exports in the
United States and Japan, where prices for German products have
risen along with the value of the German mark. That's because
Germany exports about 70 percent of its products to other EC
countries, where growth prospects for next year are positive.
   Higher interest rates on borrowed investment funds have also
failed to dampen the projections, the survey says, despite the
extra burden of revitalizing the economy of former East Germany.
   The survey, the first that includes responses from a majority of
chambers in former East Germany, indicates that after several
months of difficulty, ``many businesses in the new states expect
tangible improvements by the second half of 1991,'' Schoser told
reporters.
   About 85 percent of businesses surveyed plan investments equal
to or greater than in 1990. Reasons for the higher investments
include more stringent environmental requirements and the prospects
of rebuilding former East Germany.
   Up to 27 percent of the businesses also plan to expand hiring as
early as this fall.

   America West Airlines will freeze hiring and
eliminate some flights after reporting a $22 million loss for the
third quarter of 1990.
   The company is attempting to cut costs, which have escalated due
to the crisis in the Middle East and the rise in the price of jet
fuel, Al Frei, the airline's chief financial officer and vice
president of finance, said Monday.
   The airline has put a freeze in non-essential hiring and will
leave 200 to 300 vacant positions unfilled until the outlook
improves, Frei said. It has 14,000 employees nationwide.
   ``We don't anticipate any layoffs. We're hoping we can do this
without any of that,'' he said.
   However, he added, ``There isn't any way we can cover the impact
of fuel prices. Fuel prices are going through the roof and
affecting the entire industry.''
   Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, airlines were paying 58 cents a
gallon for jet fuel. The price hit a high of $1.43 a gallon earlier
this month.
   Frei said the increase could cost America West an extra $51
million in the October-December quarter.
   Officials said the airline still plans to build a new
maintenance hangar and move to a new terminal at Phoenix Sky Harbor
International Airport and to offer flights between Nagoya, Japan,
and Honolulu.

<TEXT>
   The defense and electronics group Thompson SA
reported a net loss of 270 million francs, or $53 million, for the
first half of 1990, down from a profit of 71 million francs, or
$13.7 million, a year ago.
   In a legal filing Monday, the state-owned group said the poor
showing in its consolidated accounts partly reflected the weakness
of the dollar and the soft North American market for its consumer
electronics unit.
   Financial costs of recent acquisitions, a decline in income from
minority-held units and stepped-up spending on research also
contributed to the loss, Thompson said.
   First-half revenue was limited to 34.6 billion francs ($6.65
billion), up 3 percent from 33.6 billion francs ($6.46 billion) in
the first six months of 1989.
   The group forecast that full-year net profits will fall from the
497 million francs, or $95.6 million, recorded for all of 1989.
   Thomson SA is not publicly traded, although it owns the listed
defense and electronics group Thompson CSF. Thomson owns the RCA
television business in North America.

   The Soviet Union agreed Tuesday to provide
Czechoslovakia 13 million tons of oil next year in a compromise
worked out by Czechoslovak Premier Marian Calfa and his Soviet
counterpart, Tass reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said Calfa worked out the deal
in six hours of talks in Moscow with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov.
   Oil supplies have been of concern to the Czechoslovak government
after Soviet authorities said this year's supply to Czechoslovakia
will be about 2.6 million tons less than planned.
   The shortfall prompted the Czechoslovak government earlier this
month to raise prices for fuel oil and gasoline by more than 30
percent.
   Czechoslovakia will pay for the oil with equipment and consumer
goods to be chosen by Soviet oilmen, Tass said. Part of the
supplies will be paid for in hard currency, the news agency
reported.
   The Soviet Union has been the main supplier of oil to Eastern
Europe for years, usually at prices far below the world market.
However, beginning Jan. 1, the Soviet government is demanding
payment at prices approaching the market level.

<TEXT>
   Investigators from Britain's Serious Fraud Office
on Tuesday raided the offices of Polly Peck International PLC, the
troubled British conglomerate.
   The raid was conducted with the knowledge of administrators
appointed last week to help Polly Peck sort out its 1.3 billion
pounds, or $2.5 billion, in debt, a Serious Fraud Office
spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, who wasn't identified in accordance with office
practice, said a number of documents would be examined at the
London headquarters of Polly Peck, which owns the Del Monte fresh
fruit and Sansui hi-fi equipment businesses.
   The raiding party included police officers and fraud office
accountants, she said.
   The office has not released any details of its investigation.
British newspaper reports said the office was looking into an
alleged share support operation involving Polly Peck stock.
   Asil Nadir, Polly Peck's chairman, was interviewed by the fraud
office on Sept. 20. Tuesday's raid also followed a search on Sept.
19 of South Audley Management Ltd., a company controlled by a Nadir
family trust.
   The company and Nadir have denied knowledge of any wrongdoing.
   A spokeswoman for the accounting firm Coopers and Lybrand, which
is an administrator to Polly Peck, said the company was made aware
of the raid shortly before it occurred.
   The spokeswoman, also speaking anonymously, said it was
``difficult to say at this stage what the implications'' are for
Polly Peck's bankruptcy proceedings.
   News of the South Audley management raid sent Polly Peck's stock
plummeting on London's Stock Exchange on Sept. 20, prompting the
company to ask for a suspension in trading in its stock.
   The company subsequently suffered a liquidity squeezed which
forced it to turn to British courts last week to obtain protection
from its creditors while it sorts out its debt. The company has
been expected to sell off assets to reduce its outstanding loans.

<TEXT>
   The president of McDonnell Aircraft Co.,
William S. Ross, on Tuesday announced he will retire after 35 years
with the company.
   Ross, 64, will step down Dec. 31. Gerry Johnston, president of
McDonnell Douglas Corp., will be temporarily assigned as the
company's president until a permanent successor can be named.
   Johnston's assignment is expected to last from six to 12 months.
He will also continue as president of McDonnell Douglas, although
McDonnell Douglas Chairman John F. McDonnell said Johnston's first
priority will be the aircraft division.
   Ross joined McDonnell Aircraft in 1955 after 11 years as an Air
Force pilot. He became executive vice president in 1985 and was
elected president a year later.
   Johnston, 59, has held a range of engineering and leadership
positions during 34 years with McDonnell Douglas, including 12
years at Douglas Aircraft Co. in Long Beach, Calif. He was vice
president-general manager of McDonnell Douglas of Huntington Beach
before being elected president of McDonnell Douglas in March 1988.

System</HEAD>

   International Business Machines Corp. on Tuesday
unveiled several new high-end personal computers and workstations
that indicate the computer giant intends to keep its machines in
the performance lead.
   IBM also announced a new version of its operating system for
personal computers, which could intensify IBM's tussle with
software giant Microsoft Corp. over which system will take the
lead.
   IBM says its two new high-end models of its Personal System-2
line are up to 2{ times faster than the previous top machine.
   Both new PS-2 models use Intel Corp.'s most powerful
microprocessor, the 486. IBM already offered a PS-2 with the 486
chip, but it uses a less speedy version of the microprocessor than
that offered as an option on the two new models.
   One of the new PS-2 models is designed to be used as a ``file
server,'' or a central data base for a network of desktop
computers. This machine, the model 95, will cost from $14,145 to
$17,745, depending on the version.
   The computer, which sits on the floor rather than the desktop,
is IBM's answer to a powerful file server introduced last year by
Compaq Computer Corp., some industry analysts say. The IBM machine
can link 25 to 35 desktop machines in a typical application, said
spokesman Kevin Clark.
   The other new PS-2, the model 90, is aimed at applications that
require a great deal of computing power, such as computer-aided
design, financial modeling and graphics-intensive programs.
   The desktop machine will cost $12,495 to $16,695, depending on
the version.
   The new PS-2s also include new graphics technology that IBM says
provides sharper graphics and will make them appear on the screen
much more quickly than the technology it replaces.
   Peter Burris, an analyst at the research firm International Data
Corp., called the new PS-2s a ``solid product.'' But, he said,
``the pricing remains IBM-like, meaning not cheap.''
   He said IBM, like several other computer makers, ``is interested
in learning as much as it can about that area between high-end PCs
and low-end midrange'' computers.
   As personal computers grow more powerful, they are blurring the
line with midrange machines, or minicomputers. However, analysts
say, minicomputers typically come with better support services from
the maker and software more closely tied to the user's needs.
   IBM, based in suburban Armonk, also announced new workstations
that offer better performance than the previous top-end models of
its RISC System-6000 line, Burris said.
   IBM disclosed the new machines to customers and analysts but
said it would not talk to reporters until a news conference
Wednesday.
   Burris said the workstations, which are aimed primarily at
scientific and engineering users, offer ``knockout performance.''
   One of the new models, the PowerServer 550, is about 38 percent
faster than the line's previous top-end file server, Burris said.
   Burris said the new models, which use IBM-developed
microprocessors and are priced at $135,000 to $137,000, offer more
performance for the money than competing workstations from Sun
Microsystems Inc., the leading workstation seller.
   IBM also announced a new version of its operatng system for the
PS-2s that takes up less computer memory. An operating system is
the base layer of software that controls a computer's internal
functions.
   The new version of Operating System-2 should allow more computer
users to convert to this operating system, which is more
user-friendly than the DOS operating system it was designed to
replace, IBM says.
   Previously, many computer users had to make costly upgrades to
their machine's memory before they could use OS-2, which was
designed in conjunction with Microsoft.
   The base version of the new operating system will cost $340.
   OS-2, introduced by IBM and Microsoft in 1987, has failed to
gain widespread popularity, in part because it requires a greater
level of memory than many computers have, analysts say.
   In addition, OS-2 competes with a software product called
Windows developed by Microsoft, which provides many of the same
ease-of-use features for the DOS operating system. The competition
between OS-2 and Windows has caused friction between IBM and
Microsoft, according to industry reports.

   Losses in normally profitable overseas operations
contributed largely Tuesday to a 78.7 percent drop in Ford Motor
Co.'s third-quarter earnings.
   The decline at the No. 2 automaker was much steeper than Wall
Street analysts had expected.
   Ford said it made $101.7 million, or 22 cents a share, during
the July-September period this year. That's down from $477.1
million, or $1.03 a share, in the third quarter last year.
   The earnings decline would have been bigger without one-time
accounting changes that boosted this year's figures by $86.9
million - $66.9 million in the United Stats and $20 million
overseas.
   Ford stock finished down $2, at $27.62{ per share, on the New
York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   No. 3 Chrysler Corp. reported a $214 million loss Monday - the
automaker's largest operational loss since the first quarter of
1981, when it was recovering from near bankruptcy.
   General Motors Corp., the nation's biggest automaker, planned to
release third-quarter earnings Wednesday. Like Ford, GM's earnings
were expected to be hurt by overseas profit declines.
   ``My impression in Europe is the whole European market turned
down in the third quarter,'' said auto analyst Mary Anne Sudol of
Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York. ``Ford relies a lot on
the United Kingdom (sales), which is down 12.5 percent for the
first nine months.''
   She said Ford held about 25 percent of the United Kingdom
market, down from 30 percent a few years ago.
   Ford said it lost $89 million on its overseas automotive
business, which in the past has helped carry less profitable North
American operations. During the third quarter last year, Ford's
overseas operations earned $324 million.
   The company said it made $50 million on its U.S. automotive
operations, but that was offset by the accounting change for a net
loss of $17 million.
   In the United States, Ford got a bit of a break from a reduction
in its incentive costs - down to $975 per vehicle from $1,000 for
each car and truck sold during the 1989 period.
   Ford's Financial Services Group, which includes consumer
financing and other operations, earned $141 million during the
third quarter of this year, down 25.8 percent from $190 million
during the same period last year.
   The group's income was reduced by $69 million, or 15 cents a
share, to boost loan reserves for its First Nationwide Bank
subsidiary, based in San Francisco.
   Ford's earnings came on $23 billion in revenues, up 13.9 percent
from revenues of $20.2 billion during the July-September period
last year.
   For the first nine months of this year, Ford earned $1.4
billion, or $2.99 a share, down from $3.52 billion, or $7.51 a
share, during the same period in 1989. Revenues for the period rose
to $73.5 billion from $72 billion.
   ``We believe that financial results will remain weak in the near
term, reflecting a continuation of the adverse factors affecting
this quarter's results,'' said a statement by Ford Chairman Harold
Poling and President Philip Benton. ``Despite the near-term
pressure on profits, we at Ford remain committed to an aggressive
capital-spending plan.''
   That spending plan and pressure on profits prompted Moody's
Investors Service Inc. of New York to downgrade securities of Ford
and some of its subsidiaries by one notch last week. However, the
ratings, which are used as a reflection of its credit worthiness,
remained well within Moody's investment grade.

<HEAD>Economy Grew Faster in 3rd Quarter; Analysts Still See Recession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a
faster-than-expected 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter, the
government said Tuesday, but the report failed to dissuade many
analysts who believe the economy is entering a recession.
   The Commerce Department report on the gross national product
showed that consumers buying cars and other items had continued to
drive the longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history
through September. Whether the expansion reaches its eighth
anniversary in November was a matter of debate.
   ``This release contradicts those who believe we are in a
recession or are about to enter one,'' Commerce Undersecretary
Michael R. Darby told reporters. His boss, Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher, added in San Antonio, ``I hope all the
doom-sayers and nay-sayers and cluck-cluckers go back in their
holes for a while.''
   But economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
in New York said, ``I believe we're in a recession. I think that
most of the things showing strength in the third quarter will be
weak in the fourth, particularly consumer spending.''
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago, also believes the economy is declining this quarter. He
contended that much of the GNP strength ``was concentrated early in
the quarter. It is by no means certain that it was growing 1.8 when
the quarter ended.''
   Indeed, Michael Boskin, chairman of Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, said, ``While this is pleasant news about the third
quarter, we are concerned about a sluggish fourth quarter and the
early part of 1991.''
   He added that he ``was certainly pleased'' with the Federal
Reserve's action Monday in pushing down a key short-term interest
rate, a move that might be expected to boost economic growth.
   The Commerce Department had continued bad news about the housing
industry Tuesday. It reported that sales of new homes slumped 6
percent in September, the ninth decline in the past 12 months and
the worst drop in half a year.
   Declining home sales suggest continued contraction in the
industry since builders often put off new projects when inventories
climb.
   The gross national product report will be revised twice in the
next two months as more information is received. The final revision
of the second-quarter GNP showed the economy grew just 0.4 percent
rather than the 1.2 percent first reported.
   Consumer spending - two-thirds of the nation's economic activity
- jumped 3.6 percent in the third quarter compared to a 0.2 percent
gain in the second. Much of the advance was due to a $3.4 billion
increase in automobile sales, which had declined $6.1 billion from
April through June.
   But the Conference Board reported last Friday that consumer
confidence in the economy plunged in October to the lowest level
since the 1981-82 recession. The New York research group said its
index tumbled more than 24 points, the biggest one-month drop in
the 20-history of the survey.
   ``The fourth quarter is going to be sick,'' said Roger Brinner,
chief economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. ``The
consumer is terrified about the future.''
   In addition to consumer spending, the department said
third-quarter economic growth was fueled by a 7.4 percent increase
in business investment.
   That activity was partially offset by a $1.7 billion decline in
inventories held by business and a $7.9 billion merchandise trade
deficit.
   Housing construction was off 15.4 percent and federal government
spending was down 0.3 percent.
   The Commerce Department also said that a GNP measure of
inflation rose to 4.1 percent in the third quarter, up from 3.9
percent in the second. It was the first GNP report since the
Persian Gulf oil-price shock pushed up the price of many consumer
goods.
   The third-quarter growth was an improvement over the meager 0.4
percent gain during the second quarter when consumer spending
inched up just 0.2 percent.
   Brinner said consumer spending was weak in the second quarter
because it was stronger than normal during the first quarter due to
unusually warm weather.
   ``If you take spending out of the second quarter and put it into
the first, obviously it depresses second quarter and makes the
third quarter look good,'' he said.
   The economy has grown for 95 months through September, far
beyond the previous peacetime record of 58 months between 1975 and
1980. The economy expanded for 106 months from 1961 to 1969,
including the Vietnam War.
   A survey this month of 52 economists by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators showed a consensus said the ``GNP is now expected to
contract on an annualized basis in both the fourth quarter of 1990
and the first quarter of 1991, providing us with the generally
accepted definition of a recession.''
   For all of 1990, the consensus forecast of the Blue Chip
economists calls for growth of 1.0 percent, just above the
administration forecast of 0.7 percent. The economy grew 2.5
percent last year, slowing from a 4.5 percent pace in 1988.
   Total GNP, the broadest measure of the nation's economic
activity, reached an annual rate of $4.17 trillion in the third
quarter when adjusted for inflation. That was a gain of $18.5
billion over the second quarter.

   General Motors Corp.'s financing, computer
services, and defense and electronics subsidiaries said Tuesday
that their third-quarter profits rose by a combined 17.3 percent
over the same period last year.
   General Motors Acceptance Corp. reported the largest jump, 24.7
percent, while Electronic Data Systems Corp. reported a 17 percent
rise in net income and GM-Hughes Electronics Corp. said its
earnings were up 7 percent.
   General Motors Corp. is expected to report earnings on
Wednesday.
   GMAC said it earned $293 million during the three months ended
Sept. 30, compared with $235 million for the third quarter of 1989.
   Lower short-term borrowing costs in the United States helped
increase net income from financing operations to $259 million from
$170 million a year earlier, the company said.
   For the first nine months of the year, GMAC said its earnings
rose to $931 million, compared with $860 million for the first nine
months of 1989.
   EDS said it had net income of $128.4 million, or 54 cents a
share, for the period, up from $110.9 million, or 46 cents a share,
for July-September 1989.
   Total revenues for the quarter rose to $1.53 billion from $1.37
billion in the third quarter of 1989.
   EDS said it receive nearly $6 billion in new computer services
contracts in the quarter, including a $450 million pact with First
Fidelity Bancorporation of Lawrenceville, N.J., and a tentative
agreement with Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., parent company
of Continental and Eastern Airlines.
   For the first nine months, EDS said it had net income of $363.5
million, or $1.52 a share, on revenues of $4.4 billion, up from
$315.8 million, or $1.31 a share, on revenues of $4.03 billion in
the first nine months of 1989.
   GM Hughes Electronics credited increased sales of torpedoes,
missiles and night vision systems for improving third-quarter net
income to $158.1 million, or 40 cents a share, from $147.8 million,
or 37 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenues rose to $2.93 billion for the period from $2.58 billion
in the third quarter of 1989, the company said.
   The increased sales in the third quarter represented orders from
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, company spokesman Bruce McCristal
said. He said it wasn't known if Mideast tensions would affect
orders for the current year.
   GM Hughes Electronics had reported profits for the first six
months of 1990 trailing last year's, due to declines in military
orders, costs associated with new spacecraft products, and tax
credits recorded in the second quarter of last year.
   For the first nine months, the company said net income was
$530.4 million, or $1.33 a share, on revenues of $8.79 billion,
still 11.3 percent behind the net income of $598.2 million, or
$1.48 a share, reported on revenues of $8.47 billion for the first
nine months of 1989.

<HEAD>Oil Dips As Market Won't Even Budge on Rumors</HEAD>

   Oil prices slid back Tuesday in a market that
was so sluggish traders wouldn't even jump at rumors as they have
for weeks.
   Analysts who have witnessed numerous rumor-induced buying and
selling binges compared the quiet session on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to ``the little boy who cried `wolf.'''
   ``This war has started so many times on the floor of the Nymex
that I think it's getting a little weary of starting there,'' said
Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in
Hoboken, N.J.
   Light sweet crude oil, the benchmark grade, was up a little more
than $1 per barrel early in the day, before dipping to close at
$34.54 per barrel, down 14 cents, for December delivery contracts.
Later delivery contracts followed a similar pattern, opening up and
closing down.
   During the light trading session, people on the exchange said
the market refused to budge on rumors that in other recent sessions
would likely have sent crude prices surging by a dollar or two. One
of the rumors even had shots being fired in the Persian Gulf.
   ``As the day wore on, they became increasingly convinced that
the general market was not behind them and we were not going to see
any knee-jerk reaction to these rumors,'' Beutel said.
   ``I think the market is a little tired,'' said Ann-Louise
Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
``It's just tired of reacting to these rumors. It's like crying
wolf for something.''
   Oil traders say they generally ``buy the rumor, sell the fact,''
but evidence of that strategy has been absent during the last two
trading sessions.
   Oil's high opening prices had been based on harsh words from
U.S. officials who warned Iraq that a military solution to the
crisis was possible. Traders and analysts could not pinpoint
anything that later pushed prices down, other than the market's
apparent case of the doldrums.
   Futures for refined petroleum products also fluctuated aimlessly
Tuesday.
   They opened higher, along with crude, and closed mixed.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline rose 1.30 cents to 93.73 cents a
gallon on November delivery contracts. Near-month contracts were
also higher, but more distant months closed lower.
   Wholesale home heating oil moved in the opposite direction,
closing with near months lower and distant months higher. November
delivery contracts were down .19 cent at 91.17 cents per gallon.
   Natural gas futures were mixed. December delivery contracts fell
2.6 cents to $2.408 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   After the market closed, the American Petroleum Institute
released weekly figures showing the nation's supply of crude oil
had fallen below 1989 levels for the first time since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The U.S. stockpile of crude dropped to 339.5 million barrels
last week, compared with 340.4 million barrels a week earlier and
345.4 million barrels a year earlier. It was the first time this
year that the crude stockpile had fallen from the comparable week a
year earlier, API said.
   The stockpile of distillates, which includes home heating oil,
was up to 138.1 million barrels, from 136.9 million barrels a week
earlier and 118.7 million barrels a year earlier. The gasoline
stockpile was down to 220.4 million barrels, from 222.6 million
barrels a week earlier and 223.2 million barrels a year earlier.
   The nation's refineries ran at 82.5 percent of capacity,
compared with 83.3 percent a week earlier and 86.6 percent a year
earlier.

   A major credit-rating agency Tuesday downgraded
slightly its opinion of the debt of Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., citing
lower ad revenue at the company's publications, including The Wall
Street Journal, and lower revenue from its electronic information
services.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded about $200 million of
Dow Jones' long-term debt from Aa3 to Aa2. The numbers, from 1 to
3, indicate gradations within the Aa category, which Moody's uses
to indicate high-grade investment bonds.
   ``Dow Jones' performance measures will not achieve historic
levels as a result of intensifying competition in information
services, lower advertising lineage in printed publications and the
prolonged downturn in the financial services sector,'' Moody's
said.
   Moody's said the company has been hurt by the continued downturn
in the financial industry, a key customer for Dow Jones'
information services.
   Dow Jones spokesman James Ambrosio said the company wasn't
surprised by Moody's action and that the new, lower rating
``continues to reflect favorably on our financial condition.''
   Earlier this month, Dow Jones announced a 17.5 percent drop in
its third-quarter earnings and said it would launch a cost-cutting
program that would include a freeze on spending and total salaries
and other reductions.

<HEAD>Company Unveils 3-D Technology for Personal Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silicon Graphics Corp. on Tuesday unveiled
technology the company said will give personal computer users
access to three-dimensional graphics previously available only on
expensive computer workstations.
   The company announced circuit boards that fit inside
International Business Machines Corp. and IBM-compatible personal
computers that use Intel Corp.'s powerful 80386 and 80486
microprocessors.
   The boards, called Irisvision, allow users to move and alter 3-D
color images on the screen and instantly see the changes they make,
a feature important to scientists and engineers.
   ``Irisvision redefines and sets new standards for personal
computer graphics,'' said Edward R. McCracken, Silicon Graphics'
president and chief executive officer. ``(It) will change the way
people use PCs for design and animation.''
   Both the boards and about 15 software packages to take advantage
of them will be available in January, the company said. More than
20 software developers are writing applications for Irisvision, it
added.
   Silicon Graphics is known for its 3-D graphics computers,
ranging from workstations starting at $10,000 to supercomputers
costing $500,000. The boards are the first product the fast-growing
9-year-old Mountain View company has produced for the personal
computer market.
   They also come as competitors, notably Sun Microsystems Inc.,
try to woo personal computer users with cheaper workstations.
   Irisvision boards will cost $3,500 to $5,000. The company hopes
to sell 25,000 boards during the first year.
   ``They give you the same graphics performance as our Personal
Iris product line (of workstations),'' said company spokeswoman
Jill Grossman of computers that range from $10,000 to about
$25,000.
   The boards allow personal computer users to put together a
system to do sophisticated graphics for as little as $7,000,
McCracken said. They should cut into Sun's strategy of offering
workstations ranging from $5,000 to $9,000, he said.
   But a spokesman for Sun, also based in Mountain View, said his
company's computers offer more than sophisticated graphics,
including networking capability and data processing not available
on personal computers.
   Robert Herwick, an analyst with the San Francisco brokerage
Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., said the development of software for the
new boards would help ensure their success.
   He also said the boards should increase demand for Silicon
Graphics' workstations, since those who like the new technology may
want to move up to the company's low-end workstations.
   Silicon Graphics posted a $32 million profit on sales of $420
million in the fiscal year ended June 30. It had $11.5 in profit on
$264 million in sales in the previous year.

   U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski said Tuesday that
public opposition to taxes and spending cuts - not partisan
politics - was the driving force behind the budget deficit debacle.
   But he warned that the budget plan will require Americans to
make sacrifices that will help put the country on sound economic
footing into the 21st century.
   President Bush has blamed lawmakers for the political wrangling
that finally ended with the budget deal reached over the weekend,
and pundits ``will blame partisan politics for the breakdown,'' the
Illinois Democrat told members of the National Soft Drink
Association.
   ``I'm not going to say it wasn't our fault, but it wasn't all
our fault,'' he told an audience of about 300 gathered for the
group's annual meeting.
   Lawmakers were faced with an impossible plea from constituents
who urged, ```Don't raise my taxes, don't cut spending, but get rid
of the deficit,''' said Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways
and Means Committee.
   ``Those are tough orders to follow, especially in an election
year,'' he said, adding, ``I'm not blaming the public, I'm simply
stating a fact.''
   Rostenkowski, who guided the budget plan through the House, said
tax increases as well as spending cuts were the only way to cut the
federal deficit.
   He blamed the budget crisis in part on years of ``greed and
selfishness'' during the Reagan administration.
   ``This attitude has got to be reversed,'' Rostenkowski said.
``And above all we have got to act together. This means a renewed
sense of patriotism.''
   ``The deficit reduction agreement is only the first step toward
regaining our economic barriers,'' he said.
   ``You will recognize in the next five years some tremendous
cuts'' in programs and services as a result of the $492 billion
deficit deal.
   ``There are cuts in the farm program, there are cuts in foreign
aid, cuts in the health area,'' he said, noting that the deal
involves $43 billion in Medicare cuts.
   ``That's a sizeable cut, services are going to be curtailed,''
Rostenkowski said.
   But he predicted voters will be willing to tighten their belts
for the sake of the economy, and won't lash back at lawmakers in
next week's election.

   The stock market turned in a mixed performance
Tuesday as some late buying sent blue chips higher but the broader
market was mired in Wall Street's economic doldrums.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which reversed course several
times during the day, ended up 17.82 at 2,448.02.
   Meanwhile, declining issues outpaced advancers by a margin of
about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 685 up, 817 down and 471 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 153.45 million
shares, up from 133.98 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 189.57 million shares.
   Stocks were lower for much of the day after the Commerce
Department's release of third-quarter gross national product
figures. The government said the economy grew at a 1.8 percent
annual rate during the July-September period, a stronger than
expected showing.
   But Wall Street was unimpressed by the figures, since much of
the increase was due to consumer spending that was in turn boosted
by higher sales of cars and trucks. Analysts said the stock market
considered the figurse and aberration and still believes the
economy is heading for a recession - especially since consumer
spending is expected to decline.
   Analysts said there was also growing uneasiness about the Middle
East that made many traders wary.
   Saddam Hussein said Tuesday Iraq was making final preparations
for war, while Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, described President
Bush's patience with the Persian Gulf situation as ``wearing
thin.''
   Sellers left Wall Street late in the session, but the buyers who
moved in were interested only in some of the blue chip stocks.
   General Electric, which been down earlier in the day, jumped 1~
to 52}; Philip Morris rose ~ to 46}; Exxon picked up 1\ to close at
48~; and Chevron gained 1\ to 68&rsqb;.
   Analysts said the market lacked the conviction necessary to make
a broad move up or down.
   ``Not with the kind of mixed (economic) signals that we're
seeing today,'' commented Dennis Jarrett, an analyst with Kidder
Peabody &amp; Co.
   Earnings reports continued to dictate the performance of some
stocks.
   Ford Motor tumbled 2 to 27| after announcing a third-quarter
earnings drop.
   But even companies with good earnings reports were suffering.
Boeing, which announced a profit increase and positive outlook on
Monday, was off 1| to 44{ on concerns the aerospace firm might not
be able to keep up its earnings pace.
   USX rose &lsqb; to 31 after announcing it would transfer its steel
business to a wholly-owned subsidiary. The company also announced a
6.8 percent drop in third-quarter earnings.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $10.391 billion, or 0.37
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.84 to 166.08.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index gained 2.18 to 357.63, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 2.18 to 304.06.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
0.97 to 329.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 288.07, off 0.72.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Surge on GNP Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices posted their strongest gains in 10
months Tuesday, rebounding from depressed levels after a government
report indicated the U.S. economy had a stronger third quarter than
most economists thought.
   Gold and silver futures turned in their best performances in
more than a month.
   On other commodity markets, petroleum futures were mixed; grains
and soybeans were mostly higher; and livestock and meat futures
were mixed.
   Platinum futures settled $18.40 to $18.70 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery in January up
$18.70 at $437 an ounce.
   It was platinum's strongest day since Jan. 4, when the near-term
contract surged $18.90 an ounce.
   Tuesday's rally marked a significant recovery for platinum,
which traded at a 4{-year low of $387.50 on Oct. 16 amid fears that
the economy was sliding into a recession.
   Those fears were eased at least temporarily by Tuesday's
Commerce Department report that the economy expanded at a 1.8
percent rate in the third quarter, more than twice as fast as most
economists had thought.
   The platinum market is sensitive to economic signals because the
metal has many industrial uses. Thirty-seven percent of the
platinum consumed last year went into automobile pollution-control
systems and another 17 percent was used in petroleum, glass,
electrical and chemical manufacturing.
   The market also tends to be volatile because platinum is more
thinly traded than the other precious metals.
   Analysts said all the precious metals were oversold and due for
a correction after at least four straight weeks of declines. They
said the initial surge prompted by the GNP report triggered waves
of buying by players who had sold precious metals earlier in the
belief that prices were headed lower still.
   Bette Raptopolous, senior metals analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities, said more economic data due out later in the week might
determine whether the gains would hold.
   Commerce Department reports on factory orders and personal
income are scheduled for release Wednesday followed by the monthly
employment statistics on Friday.
   ``If those support the thesis that we've bottomed out, you could
see platinum recover quite well and silver also, because they were
declining on this recession picture,'' Raptopolous said.
   Gold futures settled $5.60 to $6 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the November contract at $379.70 a troy ounce; silver
was 8.8 cents to 9.3 cents higher with December at $4.245 a troy
ounce.
   Crude oil futures ended lower, and heating oil and gasoline
futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid
conflicting factors.
   Escalating war rhetoric from Iraq's Saddam Hussein provided
support for the oil markets, but the strength was offset by
President Bush's assurances that U.S. consumers could count on
adequate supplies of petroleum products.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 8 cents to 36 cents lower
with December at $34.54 a barrel; heating oil was .85 cent lower to
.64 cent higher with November at 91.17 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.2 cents lower to 1.32 cents higher with November at
93.73 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago
Board of Trade, supported in part by persistent rumors of a large
sale of U.S. corn to the Soviet Union or an Eastern European
country.
   The Agriculture Department has not confirmed any large export
corn sales of corn. Nevertheless, the market was moved Tuesday, as
it was Monday, by talk that about 500,000 metric tons of corn were
sold.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 3{ cents higher with December
at $2.64\ a bushel; corn was } cent to 2{ cents higher with
December at $2.31 a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2 cents higher
with December at $1.21 a bushel; soybeans were 3{ cents lower to \
cent higher with November at $5.90{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle futures settled
.03 cent to .27 cent lower with December at 77.05 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .20 cent higher with November
at 87.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 cent lower to .10 cent
higher with December at 51.42 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .45 cent to .97 cent lower with February at 60.30 cents a
pound.

<TEXT>
   A now-defunct satellite TV company
indicted in Alabama for beaming adult films outside its home state
pleaded guilty to obscenity charges and paid a $150,000 penalty to
charity.
   The charges against the New York company were sharply criticized
Tuesday by the American Civil Liberties Union and the plea praised
by pornogrpahy opponents who contend damage done to Alabama
youngsters cannot be reversed.
   Home Dish Only Satellite Network Inc. entered the plea Monday in
state court to two misdemeanor charges of distributing obscene
materials. It was the first satellite company in the nation to be
indicted outside its home state on obscenity charges for sending
adult films to another state.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo refused in June to extradite four
executives of Home Dish indicted last year by a grand jury in
Montgomery, saying the charges were not punishable under New York
law.
   District Attorney Jimmy Evans, who is running for state attorney
general, said the plea was an admission by the company that it
``invaded the territorial boundaries of a state with hard-core
obscenity.''
   Martin McCaffery, vice president of the Civil Liberties Union of
Alabama, said the indictment lacked constitutional grounds and set
a dangerous precedent.
   ``If he (Evans) is really out to protect 12-year-olds, he should
be going after tobacco companies,'' McCaffery said.
   The indictment stemmed from an obscenity law enacted in Alabama
last year. Evans said his office began to investigate after
complaints from parents whose children bought copies of adult
movies that had been videotaped from television by schoolmates.
   The indictment led to Home Dish's American Exxxstasy Channel and
Tuxxedo channel being pulled off the air. Home Dish went out of
business after satellite owners refused to transmit its hard-core
and R-rated movies.
   Home Dish was charged for broadcasting the movies ``Santa Comes
Twice'' and ``Young Girls Do.''
   Ron Wise, a lawyer for the company, declined to say why it
pleaded guilty since Cuomo blocked extradition of the four
executives: board Chairman Paul Klein; his wife, Janet Klein, the
company's vice president; President Jeffrey Younger and Treasurer
Robert Kramer.
   Jean Faucett, executive director of Citizens Against Pornography
of Alabama, commended Evans for securing the guilty plea, but said
it won't erase images placed in the minds of youngsters by the
movies.
   ``We have a lot of studies that deal with the harmful effects of
pornography ... that the violent sexual images if they are received
at a young enough age will fuse with the normal sexual appetite,''
she said.
   ``The damage done to those children can never be undone. There
is no amount of money that can pay for that.''
   The plea signals to prosecutors nationwide that local obscenity
standards can be enforced against offenders based outside their
areas, Evans said.
   Evans said the films ``depict graphic scenes of sadomasochism,
incest, oral and anal intercourse and multiple vaginal
intercourse.''
   At its height, Home Dish had 1.2 million cable TV customers and
80,000 satellite subscribers.
   Home Dish was fined $5,000 and paid $75,000 each to two
children's homes as part of the penalty. Evans said his office
selected the charities, Father Purcell Exceptional Children Center
and Brantwood Children's Home.
   Obscenity charges against U.S. Satellite Corp. of Murray, Utah,
were dismissed. Charges are still pending against GTE Spacenet,
which owns the satellite used to broadcast the now-defunct American
Exxxstasy Channel.

<HEAD>Arizona Developer Pleads Guilty, Agrees to Cooperate in Keating
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Arizona developer pleaded guilty Tuesday
to one count of bank fraud and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors
investigating the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   Ernest C. Garcia II of Tucson told the court he planned a secret
land deal with ``certain officers and directors'' of Lincoln, an
Irvine-based savings and loan owned by American Continental Corp.
of Phoenix.
   Garcia was accused of participating in fraudulent transactions
that inflated the income of the now-failed Lincoln thrift.
   In one of those transactions, the sale of 1,000 acres near
Phoenix by a Lincoln subsidiary, he reportedly received a $30
million line of credit from Lincoln Savings.
   That deal was one of three cited in a $40.9 million civil action
filed by the federal Office of Thrift Supervision against Charles
Keating Jr., the one-time chief of American Continental, and five
others connected with the financial institution.
   Keating has been charged in state court in California with 42
counts of fraud unrelated to the Garcia case. He is free on bail
pending the outcome of that case.
   Garcia's cooperation agreement signed in federal court was
placed under seal. Assistant U.S. Attorney Alice Hill refused to
describe how Garcia had agreed to help the prosecution.

<TEXT>
   A lawyers' group and medical experts joined
Tuesday to urge the government to strengthen safeguards for people
with asthma who use an effective but potentially dangerous drug.
   They said that over-the-counter asthma medications containing
the drug theophylline should be banned, and that prescribing
physicians and their patients should be aware of the potential
hazards associated with it.
   ``Our message about theophylline is that this medication can be
a life-saver or a life-taker,'' said Michael Maher, president of
the Trial Lawyers of America.
   Schering-Plough, the leading manufacturer of theophylline
products, called the lawyers' action a ``self-serving publicity
campaign'' that will unduly alarm asthma patients and interfere
with doctor-patient relationships ``by overstating ad
overdramatizing the known risks of theophylline.''
   Company officials said their theophylline products have had a
good safety record. With more than 60 million prescriptions written
in the past five years, adverse reactions amounted to 1.3 per
100,000 prescriptions, said David Pernock, a company marketing
executive.
   Schering-Plough, however, does not make any nonprescription
theophylline products because ``we feel it is a drug that should be
monitored,'' he said.
   The Food and Drug Administration banned over-the-counter sales
of theophylline as a single-ingredient product in 1986. Two years
ago, the agency proposed a ban on other nonprescription uses of the
drug.
   The lawyers' group last week sent a letter to the Food and Drug
Administration saying it knew of 26 preventable
theophylline-related incidents of death or serious injury since
1975.
   About 10 million Americans, most of them children, suffer from
asthma, which causes about 5,000 deaths a year.
   Though not a cure, theophylline, a chemical cousin of caffeine,
is the most widely prescribed remedy to ease breathing and has been
on the market for more than 40 years.
   But, said the lawyers and medical critics of over-the-counter
sales of the chemical, theophylline is also one of the most
difficult drugs to administer and control in patients. It can be
tricky to find an effective dose without letting the drug reach
toxic levels.
   A safe dose can quickly become toxic if certain other drugs are
also taken with it or if the patient has taken over-the-counter
remedies containing theophylline. Also, the flu can turn a safe
dose toxic because the illness slows the body's elimination of the
drug. And the symptoms of toxicity are the same as for the flu:
nausea, vomiting, irritability and fever.
   Jeffry Pollock of Everett, Wash., said he wished he had known
that when a pediatrician increased the dose of theophylline
prescribed for his daughter Jennifer in 1986 when she had the flu.
Within 48 hours, she began having convulsions and suffered brain
damage, he said. Now 7, Jennifer functions at the level of a 6- to
8-month-old, he said.
   ``Theophylline was a big help to Jennifer when she needed it to
help her breathing, but it also caused severe brain damage that
Jennifer will never be able to fully recover,'' Pollock said.
   The lawyers and medical critics said patients should not
discontinue their medication without consulting doctors. But they
also said theophylline should not be available in nonprescription
medications.
   In addition, they recommended that potential hazards be more
clearly outlined in warnings given to physicians and that
simplified warnings in monmedical language also be given to
patients. And they said doctors should monitor the drug levels in
their patients with regular blood tests.
   ``Theophylline is an important and useful medication and it
needs to be made available,'' said Theodore Rall, a pharmacology
professor at the University of Virginia Medical School, who said he
has used theophylline. ``But I would urge that great caution be
used.''
   Allan Weinstein, an asthma expert at Georgetown University
Hospital, said that as with other drugs, physicians should not
prescribe theophylline unless they are comfortable with it.
   ``Theophylline is a product that requires close supervision by a
physician'' who is aware of its side effects and possible hazards,
said Weinstein, who appeared at a briefing with Pernock but said he
had no ties to Schering-Plough.

<HEAD>General Cinema Announces Agreement To Buy Outstanding Neiman Marcus
Shares</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Cinema Corp., taking advantage of its
large pool of available cash, said Tuesday it would acquire from
the public the 40 percent stake in Neiman Marcus Group it does not
already own.
   The company said it would pay $14.40 per share for the stock in
the specialty retailer.
   But investors apparently were looking for a higher price. They
bid Neiman Marcus stock $3.37{ a share higher to $14.62{ on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   General Cinema, which also owns movie theatres, holds 60
percent, or 16.3 million shares, of Neiman Marcus. The company said
it expects to pay $240 million in cash to purchase the remaining 40
percent stake.
   Peter Farwell, a vice president at General Cinema, said the
company has between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in cash, thanks
to the sale of its bottling business in March and the sale of its
shares in Cadbury Schweppes PLC last month.
   Those sales ``put them in the unusually good position to make
acquisitions when a business is selling for cheap,'' said David
Jackson, an analyst with the Western Group in New York.
   Although the retailing field is sluggish now, Jackson said
Neiman Marcus is a good long-term investment for General Cinema.
   ``Specialty retailing has grown much faster than department
stores,'' he said. ``They key in on items customers want rather
than try to sell them the world.''
   Neiman Marcus Group consists of Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman
and Contempo Casuals stores. The group, once part of Carter Hawley
Hale Stores Inc., became 60-percent owned by General Cinema and
40-percent owned by the public in a 1987 restructuring.
   Farwell said General Cinema is also lookng for a third market to
break into with some of its remaining cash.
   ``We're looking for something outside retailing, for
diversity,'' he said. Farwell would not speculate on what type of
company General Cinema might try to buy next.
   For the year ending Aug. 4, 1990, Neiman Marcus Group had
revenue of $1.69 billion and earnings of $28.2 million.
   General Cinema owns 1,450 movie screens nationwide.

   Directors of DeSoto Inc. on Tuesday
declared a special dividend of $24 a share from the proceeds of the
sale of its paint and industrial coatings business.
   The company sold the operations to thwart a takeover attempt by

   Sherwin-Williams Co. paid $80 million for DeSota's paint
business and Courtaulds PLC of London bought the industrial
coatings operations for $135 million.
   DeSoto also has agreed to sell its surfactant and emulsifier
businesses to Witco Corp. of New York. It said it will consider
another special dividend upon completion of the sale of that
business.
   DeSoto will be left with a household detergent business that

   Britain and France were linked beneath the

   The linkup fulfills a dream by Napoleon in 1802, who thought he
could defeat the English by connecting Britain to Europe with a
land passage. The Chunnel is scheduled for completion in June 1993.
   ``This is a hugely historic moment because it means, in effect,
that Britain is no longer an island,'' said a construction union
official.
   Eight workers suffered injuries, two seriously, about 90 minutes
later when a tractor towing supplies rolled over on them in a
service gallery, authorities in nearby Sangatte reported.
   The basic goal of the Channel Tunnel project is to enable
passengers to travel between London and Paris in about three hours.
That time is comparable to flying, if transport to and from
airports is included, and is half the time of a car-ferry journey.
   The conservative Daily Express newspaper noted in its Wednesday
editions that Britons would theoretically be able to walk to France
for the first time since the last Ice Age.
   The cost of the project has soared from an initial estimate of
$9.4 billion to $16.7 billion, including an extra $1.97 billion for
unforeseen cost overruns.
   The threading of the probes through 100 yards of chalk under the
English Channel marks a major turning point in three years of
drilling on the world's costliest tunnel.
   The meeting point was just over 13{ miles southeast of
Shakespeare Cliff, the British terminus near the town of Dover, and
10 miles northwest of the French town of Sangatte, near Calais.
   The tunnel starts a few miles inland on each side, accounting
for its total length of 31 miles. Geological conditions account for
the different progress on each side.
   French workers reaching the tiny hole telephoned their British
counterparts and relayed the news to TransManche officials. The
first champagne corks popped minutes later.
   ``It's an exciting moment. It's the first time we have air
passing between the two tunnels,'' said Gordon Crighton, tunnel
engineering manager.
   ``We see it as just another exercise, but I'm sure there will be
a lot of parties going on,'' he said.
   Preliminary tests indicated the two halves were 20 inches out of
alignment. Another day will be needed to be certain, technicians
said, but they called the line-up ``exceptional,'' considering the
massive boring machines are drilling holes about three stories
high.
   The workers will now bore out a one-yard hole to permit passage
from one half to the other. They are expected to greet each other
with handshakes in a few weeks.
   Two Japanese-designed boring machines are drilling the tunnel.
After it is finished, one will be dismantled and hauled out in
pieces. The other will drill its own grave and be buried in cement
because French officials said it will be too costly to extricate
it.
   A work slowdown since last week by militant tunnelers demanding
more pay on the French side appeared likely Monday to stall the
linkup until the weekend or beyond.
   But TransManche officials said earlier Tuesday that the meeting
in the middle would occur on schedule.
   The Chunnel actually consists of three tunnels - two for railway
trains and a smaller maintenance tunnel between them.
   Taking into account all the tunnels, 80 percent of the drilling
has been completed by giant, Japanese-built boring machines working
from Calais and Folkstone, England.
   Tuesday's linkup in the service tunnel is described by the
French as a ``mouse ole'' - a bore only two inches in diameter.
   President Francois Mitterrand and Mrs. Thatcher are expected to
meet each other in the tunnel Jan. 26, after the digging for much
of the tunnel is finished. The first coupling of the two rail
tunnels is scheduled for mid-1991.
   Eurotunnel PLC, the world's largest engineering project,
announced Oct. 8 that it had reached an agreement with its banks on
$3.5 billion in new credit. More than 200 banks are involved in the
financing.
   The Chunnel's scheduled debut in mid-1993 would come six months
after the 12-nation European Community formally drops remaining
trade barriers, becoming a unified marketplace of 320 million
consumers.
   Officials estimate the tunnel may carry 28 million passengers in
the first year of operation, although Eurotunnel doesn't expect a
profit until the end of the century.
   A study released last Friday in Paris by transportation experts
said the tunnel's completion will aggravate traffic congestion in a
wide area of continental Europe.
   Some Britons have worries of a different sort, fearing an influx
of ills from the continent ranging from terrorism to rabid animals.
   Since construction began in late 1987, there have been seven
deaths on the British side and two on the French. Five British
firms were ordered last Wednesday to stand trial on charges related
to the death of a construction worker last year.
   The undersea bond between the two hereditary enemies was
envisioned nearly 200 years ago by a French engineer called Albert
Mathieu.
   Napoleon wanted to build it, but Britain warned him off.
Tunneling actually started in subsequent efforts in 1882 and 1974,
but were abandoned.

<HEAD>MGM-Pathe Deal Delayed Again</HEAD>

   For the third time in a week, the
$1.36 billion merger between Pathe Communications Corp. and MGM-UA
Communications Co. was postponed Tuesday, but officials said the
deal would close Thursday.
   In a joint statement, the companies said the closing was delayed
by accounting procedures, incomplete closing documentation and the
transfer of certain funds from MGM-UA to Pathe.
   Those funds, totalling some $700 million, are to be used by
Pathe to acquire MGM-UA in the complicated deal.
   After a four-month extension, the original closing date was Oct.
23. That deadline was not met, nor was another Friday.
   A spokesman for Pathe said the delays did not mean the deal was
imperiled.
   ``The fundamentals are still in place,'' Craig Parsons said.

<HEAD>Judge Approves $22 Million Settlement Against SmithKline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday approved a $22
million settlement of a class action suit filed in 1988 by
stockholders of what was then SmithKline Beckman Co., according to
attorneys for the shareholders.
   Preliminary approval of the settlement was given in August.
   The shareholders accused the pharmaceutical company of
misleading investors and not disclosing information that would have
hurt the price of its stock.
   The suit alleges Smithkline knew that sales of its major
products were on their way down and the company would not meet its
promised growth rate of 10 percent in 1988.
   U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Broderick made no decision on
the validity of the investors' claims.
   The company, now SmithKline Beecham, has denied any liability or
violation of the law.
   Richard D. Greenfield, an attorney representing the plaintiffs,
said it was not yet determined how much each investor would receive
on the claims.
