   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter worked
with White House officials Tuesday in preparation for tough Senate
confirmation questions, declaring his blood was ``circulating a
little bit better'' as the astonishment of his selection began to
wear off.
   He brushed aside questions about his views on abortion, one of
the issues senators are sure to emphasize during the confirmation
hearings that are expected to begin in September.
   President Bush cautioned the Senate not to accept or reject
Souter on the basis of any single issue and predicted ``he will be
a great justice.''
   Congressional leaders' comments were mostly muted, as were
remarks from interest groups on the left and right. Souter was
still an unknown quantity.
   Elliot Mincberg of the liberal People for the American Way,
said, ``He doesn't have much of a track record.'' Pat McGuigan of
the conservative Heritage Foundation said, ``Nobody knows anything
about him. In terms of Senate confirmation, this is very helpful.''
   A report of Souter's unfavorable comments about affirmative
action emerged in Wednesday editions of The Union Leader in
Manchester, N.H.
   In a 1976 speech at commencement exercises of New England
Aeronautical Institute and Daniel Webster College, Souter
criticized federal guidelines which require an employer to give
preference to a particular ethnic or racial group, saying ``the
government should not be involved in this.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
had enlisted Kenneth M. Duberstein, a private lobbyist who was a
White House chief of staff in the Reagan administration, ``to serve
as a private adviser'' to steer Souter through the confirmation
process.
   Souter spent several hours at the White House where he was
interviewed by the FBI to update his judicial clearance and told by
presidential aides that his life would be picked apart, and
everything he had ever written or said closely scrutinized.
   One participant, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity,
said Souter calmly listened to the advice and indicated there was
nothing in his past that he felt uncomfortable with.
   One senior administration official said White House counsel C.
Boyden Gray questioned Souter Monday morning about whether there
was anything in his background that might prove embarrassing, such
as the marijuana use that forced Douglas Ginsburg to withdraw as a
Reagan administration nominee in 1987. Souter's answers ``were all
satisfactory,'' the official said.
   Administration sources said Bush interviewed one other possible
nominee Monday _ Edith H. Jones of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Houston _ before choosing Souter. Two other judges _
Laurence H. Silberman of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington and Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr _ were on the
final list but were not interviewed, the sources said.
   Souter met with the president's congressional liaison, Fred
McClure, and other aides while the president himself touted his
choice while out campaigning for GOP candidates in the Northeast.
   Bush called Souter, whom he met for the first time Monday, ``a
great man of enormous intelligence, strength, a tough trial court
judge with a great legal mind and an impartial quality that will
serve the court well.''
   There was no immediate argument to that glowing portrayal from
Capitol Hill. In Souter, 50, a longtime New Hampshire state judge
and since April a member of the 1st U.S. Court of Appeals in
Boston, Bush found a candidate without a record on abortion or
other controversial topics.
   ``At this point it's no hits, no runs, no errors. It may not be
a good thing in a justice, but it's a good thing in sending up a
nominee to be confirmed,'' said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a
liberal member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a senior conservative on the
committee, said he hadn't heard a single senator express misgivings
about Souter.
   ``Not any,'' he said. ``It's amazing to me to have a
conservative who is accepted by both sides of the fence as he is,''
he said.
   Hatch, in a morning radio interview, raised some eyebrows when
he mentioned as a possible concern the fact that Souter had never
been married.
   ``I didn't mean that the way it came off,'' he said later.
Having a wife and family just helps expose a man to ``the wide
range of human emotions,'' a good thing for a judge, he said.
   Bush on Monday announced his choice of Souter to fill the
vacancy created by the retirement last Friday of Justice William
Brennan. The president was to formally submit the nomination to the
Senate on Wednesday, after which Souter was to pay courtesy calls
on Republican and Democratic leaders.
   ``It is just the normal practice associated with new nominees,''
said McClure, who, along with Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., was to
shepherd Souter around Capitol Hill. Rudman is a longtime
acquaintance, and the judge was using his office as a base of
operations during his visit to Washington.
   Rudman and Souter invited news organizations in for a photo
session, during which Souter said he was just getting used to the
idea that he was the nominee.
   ``The blood is circulating a little bit better than it was
yesterday afternoon at five o'clock,'' he said. ``I didn't think it
was going to happen. I was astonished.''
   Souter, who seemed nervous at Bush's side the day before,
appeared relaxed on Wednesday, smiling and bantering with reporters.
   He brushed aside all substantive questions, such as his views on
abortion, saying he would withhold comment until his confirmation
hearings.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., has not set a
date for the hearings although several GOP lawmakers said they
hoped they would take place early in September. Bush called on
Congress to approve his nomination before the court begins its fall
term on the first Monday in October.

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Announces $150 Million Clean-Up</HEAD>

   Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant
executives on Tuesday unveiled a five-year, $150 million plan to
correct environmental and management problems at the plant.
   In announcing the plan, Bob Nelson, the Department of Energy's
Rocky Flats manager, said the plant, shut since last November
because of safety concerns, wouldn't resume plutonium production
for several months.
   ``There are still a lot of things that need to be fixed. It's (a
restart) months away rather than weeks away. Other than that, I
can't say,'' Nelson told reporters.
   The government-financed clean-up plan addresses 92 findings by
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins' so-called ``Tiger Team'' that
inspected the plant outside Denver last summer.
   The problems ranged from lack of a single on-site environmental
executive to paving of a parking lot, apparently to reduce
wind-blown dust from the plant that manufactures plutonium triggers
for nuclear weapons.
   Dave Simonson, DOE's deputy plant manager, said 55 of the
findings by the Tiger Team will be corrected by the end of the year.
   Among the complaints are that soil and groundwater are
contaminated and that sewage treatment plant is contaminated with
hazardous _ though not radioactive _ waste. Residents fear that
contaminated water from the sewage treatment plant has seeped into
their groundwater supplies.
   The plan also calls for hiring or training certified operators
for the sewage treatment plant.
   The plan doesn't cover the ongoing removal of 62 pounds of
plutonium from the ventilation ducts of several plant buildings.
   Nelson noted that the present plant contractor, EG&amp;G Inc., took
over from Rockwell International on Jan. 1, months after the Tiger
Team inspection.
   Rockwell won't have to pay for the cleanup, Nelson said.

   The parents of an infant girl who starved to
death on an herbal diet were sentenced to nearly two years in
prison on Tuesday for failing to provide the necessities of life
for their daughter.
   Khachadour Atikian, 54, and his wife, Sonia, 38, showed little
emotion as they were led handcuffed from Ontario Supreme Court
after Justice John O'Driscoll imposed the maximum sentence _ two
years less one day in jail.
   Their 16-month-old daughter, Lorie, died in September 1987. Her
emaciated, jaundiced body had wasted away to 11 pounds.
   The judge said the maximum term is reserved for the worst
scenarios, adding: ``Quite frankly, I can't think of a worse
possible situation than this.''
   ``How could anyone in their right mind and in their right senses
not see this helpless child? I'd call not one but a dozen
ambulances,'' O'Driscoll said.
   The couple came to Canada from Lebanon in the mid-1970s and have
two healthy teen-age children.
   A jury convicted them this month after witnesses at the six-week
trial testified about the Atikians' involvement with an herbalist.
   Evidence suggested the herbalist persuaded the parents that
doctors would kill their baby.
   One witness said the herbalist told the mother taking the infant
to a doctor would be ``like holding a loaded gun to the baby's head
and pulling the trigger.''
   Testimony said the herbalist insisted the Atikians should follow
his health and diet regimen if they wanted to have the
``superbaby'' they planned.
   A picture of Lorie on her first birthday, presented as evidence,
showed a normal, healthy child. A police photograph taken hours
after Lorie's death showed her bird-like frame covered with rashes
and open sores.
   The jury was told Lorie had not been seen by a doctor for more
than eight months and had never been immunized against disease. Her
diet consisted of brown rice, raw vegetables, pureed fruits and
fruit juices, but no milk.
   The day before the baby died, the herbalist told Mrs. Atikian to
wrap Lorie in cabbage leaves to draw out the poisons, the jury was
told.
   The herbalist is being investigated by the Ontario College of
Physicians and Surgeons to see if he has been practicing medicine
without a license. Such a finding could lead to criminal charges.

   The ethereal romance of ``Ghost'' spirited
``Die Hard 2'' out of first place at the box office, collecting a
lively $12.5 million in its second weekend out.
   Figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. showed
``Ghost'' with a robust per-screen average of $8,945, more than
double the average for ``Die Hard 2.''
   ``Ghost,'' which could become the summer's surprise hit, stars
Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in the story of how Swayze's ghost
tries to save his lover, Moore, and solve his own murder.
   Bruce Willis' ``Die Hard 2'' fell to No. 2 after two weeks in
the lead, collecting $10 million. In third with a moderate opening
of $8 million was the spider drama ``Arachnophobia,'' the first
release of the Walt Disney Co.'s Hollywood Pictures.
   ``Navy SEALS,'' the latest war-theme, action-adventure,
premiered in fourth with ordinary grosses of $6.5 million. In fifth
was the re-released cartoon ``Jungle Book, taking in another $6.1
million for a two-week capture of $18.1 million.
   ``Days of Thunder,'' with Tom Cruise racing a stock car and
courting an attractive doctor, finished in sixth with ticket sales
of $5.5 million. Bill Murray's ``Quick Change'' stayed in seventh
on receipts of $3.3 million.
   ``Dick Tracy'' reported ticket sales of $3.1 million for eighth,
and should pass the $100 million mark by next week.
   Audiences quickly grew tired of Andrew Dice Clay, as his movie
``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane'' plummeted 53 percent from fifth
to ninth with a gross of $3 million.
   In 10th was ``Total Recall,'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger,
netting $2.2 million.
   Harrison Ford in ``Presumed Innocent'' arrives in theaters
Friday, and it is expected to generate bustling box office business.
   Below are the figures compiled by Exhibitor Relations, with
distributor, weekend gross, number of theater screens, average per
screen, total gross and number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Ghost,'' Paramount, $12.5 million, 1,400 screens, $8,945
per screen, $32.3 million, two weeks.

<HEAD>Fires Burning in Alaska And in Western States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 28 grafs to UPDATE with details on problems caused
by smoke in Alaska; UPDATE fire conditions in Oregon and Idaho.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dense smoke on Monday obscured the more
than 100 fires that had charred one million acres of forest and
tundra, and the weather remained warm and dry.
   One fire burned within two miles of an underground section of
the trans-Alaska oil pipeline, but didn't threaten the line.
   Smokejumpers and fire-fighting crews, who had been released
after showers helped dampen many of Alaska's fires, were being
recalled, said John Quinley, a spokesman at Denali National Park.
   In the Lower 48, two dozen new fires were started by lightning
in Washington state. Crews made progress against other fires in
that state and in Utah, Oregon, California and Montana, while
lightning ignited new blazes in Idaho.
   Crews in Alaska concentrated on just a few of the 129 fires
reported burning across the central part of the state, said Trish
Hogervorst-Rukke, a spokeswoman with the Alaska Fire Information
Center in Fairbanks.
   ``They're concentrating on the fires threatening structures,''
Hogervorst-Rukke said.
   ``The smoke is so dense that it's reducing temperatures and
raising the relative humidity in some areas,'' she said. ``The sun
simply can't penetrate it.
   ``The flip side is that we can't see the fires. We're using a
specially modified plane with an infrared camera to look through
the smoke and locate the hot spots.''
   Ninety fire crews, or more than 2,600 people, were fighting the
fires, which had charred 1,006,080 acres of Alaska timber and
tundra by Monday, officials said. Most of the fires were caused by
lightning.
   An air-quality alert was declared in Fairbanks during the
weekend because of smoke. Visibility at a visitors center at Denali
National Park dropped to a quarter-mile during the weekend.
   The interruption of light-aircraft flights had repercussions in
some communities not served by roads.
   The smoke grounded some light planes, a lifeline to much of
near-roadless Interior.
   ``I haven't turned a prop yet today,'' said Walt Walton, owner
of an air-taxi service in the Kuskokwim River community of McGrath,
225 miles northwest of Anchorage, where visibility early Monday was
one-half mile.
   Mail delivery was interrupted out of McGrath and Walton was two
days overdue in picking up clients he earlier had flown to their
remote hunting camp in the Alaska Range.
   People with respiratory problems were advised to stay indoors.
   Motorists on the Taylor Highway near the Alaska-Canada border
encountered periodic delays on Monday. A pilot car escorted
vehicles along the smoky highway.
   State highway officials advised motorists not to drive the
two-lane Dalton Highway north of Fairbanks.
   The Tok River fire, started by lightning three weeks ago, was
the state's most labor-intensive fire, occupying 789 firefighters.
   The Beaver fire north of the Yukon River was Alaska's largest.
As of Sunday it had burned across a section of spruce forest 10
miles wide by 48 miles long, Hogervorst-Rukke said. The fire had
approached to within four miles of the Chandalar River, and
authorities expected the blaze to diminish once it hit the river,
she said.
   The Kanuti Flats fire, about 140 miles north of Fairbanks, had
burned through 100,000 acres of tundra and was within two miles of
a buried section of the trans-Alaska pipeline. Authorities were
monitoring the fire but it was not being fought.
   In north-central Washington, firefighters contained a
human-caused wildfire in 634 acres of grass, brush and trees and
reported progress Monday on a 300-acre blaze in eastern Skagit
County.
   Sheela McLean of the Okanogan National Forest in north-central
Washington said 24 fires, none more than an acre, were noted Monday
after a series of thundershowers.
   Firefighters near Richfield, Utah, in the south-central part of
the state, were close Monday to declaring full control over a fire
that had charred about 250 acres on rugged terrain in the Fishlake
National Forest.
   About 500 firefighters worked in central Oregon to control a
blaze in the Deschutes National Forest. The Topso Butte fire, about
15 miles east of La Pine or south of Bend, had spread through 680
acres of lodgepole pines, said Ron Lunnum, information officer for
the Interagency Coordinating Center in Portland. He said the blaze
was caused by people.
   At least 42 small wildfires were ignited by lightning overnight
in northeastern Oregon, in the Wallowa Whitman National Forest, the
Umatilla National Forest and the Malheur National Forest. The
largest reached 200 acres, Lunnum said.
   In Idaho, lightning strikes Monday ignited a handful of forest
fires from the Nevada border to the central mountains.
   In west-central Idaho's Payette National Forest, about 30 smoke
jumpers and other personnel were committed to 11 spot fires.
   Lightning also ignited the 250-acre Willow Creek fire about 15
miles west of Hailey and the Sun Valley ski area, said Carlos
Mendiola, spokesman for the Shoshone BLM District.
   Crews neared containment on a blaze that had blackened 3,650
acres of rugged land behind Pine Flat Reservoir in the Sierra
National Forest in California's Sierra Nevada. The only structures
burned since the fire was started Friday by a power line
malfunction were two old, abandoned cabins, officials said.
   Firefighters completed lines around the Gird Point fire in
southwestern Montana, and officials said they had begun
demobilizing crews. The size of the fire, started July 12 by
lightning, was estimated at 2,600 acres.
   Officials were confident that the fire was finally ``winding
down'' but were reluctant to say it was contained because strong
wind gusts could blow it past fire lines, said Tim Eldridge, a fire
information officer with the Bitterroot National Forest.

<TEXT>
   The law enforcement officers of ``Cop Rock''
burst into song. In ``Twin Peaks,'' they guzzle coffee, speak in
hyperbole and covet cherry pie.
   Is ABC being weird simply for the sake of being weird? Has TV
gotten so predictable that the only way to stand out is to be
completely off the wall?
   Not if you ask ``Cop Rock'' creator Steven Bochco or ``Twin
Peaks'' executive producer Mark Frost.
   ``I think there's a real trap in trying to create programming
that is simply going to be scarier or more out there than the next
guy's program,'' Bochco told TV columnists during a weekend session
of ABC's summer press tour.
   And no, Frost said, ``Twin Peaks'' was not trying to pull a fast
one on its audience by being confusing.
   ``I think that's ascribing some pretty terrible character traits
to us,'' Frost said. ``I don't think we'd give up two years of our
lives to play a joke on the American public.''
   But the questions asked of Bochco and Frost during separate
sessions at the Century Plaza hotel centered on whether these two
shows weren't just a little too out there for the American public.
   ``Cop Rock'' is ABC's newest venture into the realm of weird TV
and makes its debut in the fall. The pilot, with music by Randy
Newman, has been screened for TV critics and affiliated stations of
ABC.
   The affiliates didn't quite know what to make of the first
installment, which contained a jury belting out a guilty verdict in
choir robes, a junkie selling her baby for a fix and a police
officer who resolves a botched attempt to arrest a cop-killer by
simply murdering him.
   During last month's affiliate convention in Los Angeles, a large
portion of the audience walked out during the ``Cop Rock''
screening.
   Several complained to Bochco _ the mastermind of hits such as
``Hill Street Blues'' and ``L.A. Law'' _ that ``Cop Rock'' wouldn't
play in Peoria.
   ``Twin Peaks,'' by Frost and film director David Lynch,
premiered as a spring replacement series in April and almost
immediately became one of the most talked-about and written-about
shows in television history.
   The goings-on of a fictional Northwest lumber town included the
murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer, a dwarf who spoke
backwards in a dream sequence, lots of talk about coffee and junk
food, and enough plot twists to induce motion sickness.
   When the series ended this season without solving the murder of
beauty queen Palmer, audiences were incensed.
   ``Twin Peaks'' will repeat all eight original episodes beginning
Aug. 5. Its fall season begins Sunday, Sept. 30, with a two-hour
special, after which the series moves to a new time slot, 10 p.m.
Saturday.
   Frost, in keeping with the show's tone, was humorously vague
about what will happen next season.
   He hedged about when, or how, Palmer's murderer will be
identified.
   Coffee-loving FBI agent Dale Cooper, played by Kyle MacLachlan,
will remain in Twin Peaks, investigating other crimes besides
Palmer's killing, Frost said.
   Obviously, Cooper survives the season-ending shooting by a
mysterious gunperson, Frost said.
   ``I thought we were poking a little fun at the `Who Shot J.R.?'
episode (of CBS' `Dallas'),'' Frost said.
   ``Of course, he's wearing a bulletproof vest. He's an FBI agent
who just came off an undercover assignment.''
   Bochco gave away a few plot tidbits for ``Cop Rock'': The
murdering police officer will be indicted, and actress Barbara
Bosson (also Bochco's wife) will undergo cosmetic surgery as the
fictional and corrupt mayor of Los Angeles.
   Miss Bosson, who starred in ``Hill Street Blues'' and
``Hooperman,'' is covered with disfiguring, latex makeup in the
``Cop Rock'' pilot.
   Newman's musical input was limited to the pilot, Bochco said. An
in-house team of music writers supplies five songs for each
subsequent episode.
   The idea for ``Cop Rock'' came from someone who suggested ``Hill
Street Blues'' should be a Broadway musical, Bochco said.

<TEXT>
   Catching a genetically engineered cold
might one day be a way to alleviate some of the worst symptoms of
cystic fibrosis, researchers say.
   Researchers are trying to insert a life-saving gene into viruses
that cause the common cold. Such genetically engineered viruses
might be able to carry the gene into the lung tissue of cystic
fibrosis patients, whose lungs are clogged with mucus and prone to
sometimes fatal infections.
   ``These are already being tested,'' said Robert Beall, vice
president for medical affairs at the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in
Bethesda, Md.
   The genetically altered cold viruses are among cystic fibrosis
research studies made possible by last year's discovery of the
cystic fibrosis gene.
   On Monday, Lap Chee Tsui, one of the discoverers of the gene,
said that a single rare kind of defect in the gene has been found
in about 70 percent of cystic fibrosis carriers. He spoke at the
Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor.
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic disease in
Caucasians. It affects about one in 2,000 Caucasian babies, but it
is relatively uncommon in other populations.
   The rare defect found in many carriers occurs almost exclusively
in Caucasians, explaining why the disease is more common in
Caucasians than in others, said Tsui, professor of molecular and
medical genetics at the University of Toronto.
   It is marked by digestive and respiratory problems, especially
the buildup of thick mucus in the lungs that can lead to recurrent
infections that often prove fatal.
   The cause of the disease is not known. But the discovery of the
faulty gene should allow researchers to sort out exactly what is
going wrong in the lungs, pancreas and other affected organs.
   For example, researchers have now identified an antibody to
track the protein made by the cystic fibrosis gene, Beall said.
Studies suggest that the protein is getting where it is supposed to
go, but it is not doing the job it is supposed to do.
   Such clues are essential in figuring out precisely what is going
wrong in cystic fibrosis patients, then devising ways to fix it.
   One unfortunate development has been the discovery that in
addition to the one defect identified in Caucasians, more than 40
other kinds of mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene can also cause
cystic fibrosis.
   That complicates the job of prenatal diagnosis of cystic
fibrosis. At present, researchers cannot tell parents whether their
children will be born with the disease.
   In families in which one child has the disease, however, doctors
can do prenatal tests to determine whether subsequent fetuses are
affected with the disease.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The return from exile of two key
figures in past dictatorial regimes is threatening the survival of
Haiti's caretaker government, fueling doubts about whether credible
elections can be held.
   Lawlessness plagues this impoverished Caribbean nation of 6
million people. Violence is on the rise, with unpunished political
killings heightening the sense of fear and distrust.
   Political leaders say they are under constant death threats and
never sleep at home, fearing assassination.
   ``You drive with your hand on your gun, you avoid taking the
same roads, you sleep at friends' homes, never your own house,''
said Jean-Claude Roy, leader of the Haitian Constitutional Union, a
center-left party.
   ``We will not go into elections with this type of terror in the
streets,'' said presidential candidate Louis Dejois Jr.
   General elections are tentatively planned for Nov. 4.
   Critics say President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot is weak, breaks
promises, can't control the army and doesn't consult with the
18-member Council of State with which she is supposed to govern
jointly.
   Many political leaders blame her 4-month-old government for
creating an atmosphere that allowed the return of Roger Lafontant,
reputed head of the Tonton Macoutes, the brutal militia that
enforced the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship.
   ``Lafontant was the chief of everybody here. It is like the
return of Himmler, the head of the Gestapo,'' said Serge Voltaire,
a member of the Council of State. ``Everybody is afraid of him, and
she's not doing anything.''
   The Duvalier family dictatorship, which began in 1957 when
Francois Duvalier gained the presidency, ended in 1986 when his son
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled the country after months of
civil disorder.
   Also back from exile is retired army Maj. Gen. Williams Regala,
who went to the United States following the March ouster of Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril, one of a succession of military men who ruled
after Jean-Claude Duvalier Doc fled.
   As minister of interior and defense, Regala was responsible for
security during the thwarted November 1987 attempt at elections.
Balloting was canceled after 34 voters were shot and hacked to
death by thugs linked to the army.
   Lafontant, who is in hiding, has hired three lawyers to aid his
effort to remain in Haiti. He said last week before going into
hiding that he intends to become president.
   The pressure has been building for Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot to
arrest Lafontant, but the army isn't carrying out her orders.
   ``The problem is not Madame Trouillot. The problem is the
army,'' said Social Affairs Minister Claudette Werleigh. ``I don't
know if she has power or even if the general himself has power.''
   The general is Armed Forces chief Herard Abraham, who commands a
corrupt and often violent force of 6,000.
   ``It's not clear to the army that this (democracy) is in their
best interest and because of this they are ambivalent,'' said Marc
Bazin, former World Bank economist and presidential candidate.
``But they are not interested in returning to the past.''
   Some Haitians speculate that Duvalier is to return from his
French exile.
   ``The Duvalierists just want a chance to come back to power,''
said Ms. Werleigh. ``And the level of misery is so low in this
country, the people would accept money from Duvalierists.''
   When Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was appointed provisional president
on March 13, expectations ran high, perhaps too high, that the
rampant lawlessness and corruption that was the stamp of
Duvalierism might be stemmed.
   ``How can you expect a transitional government to be expedient
in bringing justice?'' said Bazin. ``You need a government that has
legitimacy, nationally and internationally. This will only happen
with elections.''
   It is a sentiment shared by the United States, which has tied
renewal of $70 million in aid, cut after the Election Day massacre,
to the holding of legitimate elections.
   ``Unfortunately, you can't get to democracy without elections,''
said U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde. ``Only a credibly
elected government will be able to reform the military and deal
with financial and lending institutions.''
   A Supreme Court judge, Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was chosen by a
coalition of political leaders who organized that mass protests
that led to Avril's ouster.
   ``Everyone thought she would be different because she was a
woman and because the army gave up power to her,'' said Ms.
Werleigh.
   But many political organizations are now clamoring for Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot's resignation and vow to boycott elections if she
is still in the National Palace come November.
   The lack of an investigation following the assassination of
council member Serge Villard and labor leader Jean-Marie Montes by
gunmen wearing army uniforms on June 21 was interpreted by some as
a clear sign that free and fair elections would be impossible.
   ``We want elections, but with security. We know danger from the
past,'' said Dr. Louis Roy, the main author of the 1987
constitution and president of the Council of State. ``We can't
continue going backward.''

   This just in: U.S. army of imperialist aggression
continues to support the traitor Roh Tae-woo and his puppet South
Korean government of satanic hooligans.
   Flashback to the Cold War?
   No, just the world according to Communist North Korea's official
news agency, where strident, near hysterical, name-calling of
longtime enemies remains daily fare and helps keep tension high on
the Korean Peninsula.
   In the era of ``glasnost'' in the Soviet Union and a crumbling
socialist world, reports from North Korea's Central News Agency
seem an anachronism _ final dispatches from the Cold War front.
   Some examples of recent articles from the news agency, often
quoting other North Korean media, monitored in Tokyo:
   _The official Korean Roman Catholics Association was quoted as
calling Seoul's arrest of South Koreans who traveled to the north a
``human strangulation which can be committed only by satanic
hooligans without an iota of human reason and national conscience.''
   _The United States, which fought with the south against the
north 40 years ago, is the ``midwife and wirepuller of the DLP (the
governing party in Seoul).''
   GIs stationed in South Korea are ``soldiers of the U.S.
imperialist aggression army.''
   _President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea is usually referred to as
a ``traitor.'' He is forever up to something ``sinister.''
   Among the names given his followers are ``group of heinous
stranglers of democracy'' or simply ``gangsters.'' They pass
legislation ``further fascistizing the South Korean socio-political
life'' or they try ``with bloodshot eyes to obliterate'' democratic
forces in the south.
   The North Korean media were a bit more gracious after Roh
announced last week a proposal to open the border between the rival
nations. He was called the ``South Korean chief executive'' in
reports on his proposal, but a few days later he was a ``traitor''
again.
   In comparison with the North Korean media, the few other
remaining hard-line Communist nations tend to use language not
quite so vitriolic.
   Vietnam's media, for example, are using the once standard ``U.S.
imperialists'' less frequently as Hanoi seeks to improve relations
with Washington.
   Neutral terms such as the ``government in Washington'' appear as
frequently as ``Yankee aggression'' in the official Cuban news
agency, Prensa Latina.
   And in Communist China, state-run media forgo the use of nasty
adjectives on reports about the rival Nationalist Chinese
government on Taiwan.
   Hajime Izumi, an associate professor at the University of
Shizuoka, said he doubts ``glasnost'' will reach North Korea, known
as one of the most isolated countries in the world, any time soon.
   A specialist in North Korean affairs, Izumi says the tightly
controlled Pyongyang media prevent the average citizen from knowing
much about the outside world, particularly the more affluent south.
   If such information were to become widely available, Izumi said,
``criticism toward the leadership in North Korea would increase.''
   Izumi, who visited Pyongyang twice last year, said the strident
news reports were primarily for domestic consumption.
   He said North Korean officials told him not to pay much
attention to the Cold War terminology because its main purpose is
to indoctrinate the country's own citizens.
   But not all is anti-American, anti-Roh venom on the North Korean
wire.
   To show that Pyongyang has friends throughout the world, there
are frequent news items on the activities of somewhat obscure
groups who support the government of President Kim Il-sung.
   Among the groups whose study of Kim's works were mentioned last
week: The Conakry Embroidery Study Center of Guinea and the Group
of Central African Youth for the Study of Kimilsungism.

   Hot pink is in for cars and trucks, from palm

   Auto parts stores are having a tough time keeping shelves full

<TEXT>
   The gap between the rich and poor widened
during the 1980s, while middle-income Americans' share of all
income was the lowest in more than 40 years, a liberal research
group says.
   The changes were spurred in part by the tax law changes of the
Reagan years, according to a report by the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a non-profit research group specializing in
policy issues affecting the poor.
   The report released Monday was based on an analysis of recently
released Congressional Budget Office tax and income statistics.
   As a result of shifts in tax burdens and capital gains income,
the center said, the richest 1 percent receive nearly as much of
Americans' total income after taxes as the bottom 40 percent.
   The bottom 40 percent will receive 14.2 percent of total
after-tax income received by all groups in 1990, while the top 1
percent will receive 12.6 percent.
   ``This marks a sharp change from 1980, when the top 1 percent
received half as much after-tax income as the bottom 40 percent,''
it said.
   The center also said Census Bureau statistics show that the
share of family income going to the middle 20 percent of Americans
reached a low of 16.7 percent in 1988, the last year for which
figures were available. The figure was 17 percent in 1947, reached
a high of 18.1 percent in 1957 and remained between 17 and 18
percent through 1984.
   Robert Greenstein, executive director of the center, said the
changes were due in part to increased income from capital gains
received by the wealthy.
   The findings, he said, were an argument against President Bush's
call for a cut in the tax on capital gains.
   ``Since the vast bulk of capital gains income goes to the very
wealthy, they would receive most of the benefits from a reduction
in taxes on capital gains,'' Greenstein said.
   Bush and other advocates of cutting the capital gains tax say it
would provide an added incentive for people to invest capital in
job-creating new and expanded businesses.
   The report said the most affluent Americans received large
income gains during the 1980s, while middle income people gained
little and the poor fell behind.
   The top 1 percent of the population will receive an expected
average of more than $175,000 in capital gains income in 1990, up
$92,000 from what they received in 1980 after adjusting for
inflation, the report said.
   By contrast, those in the bottom 90 percent are projected to
receive an average capital gains income of $299 in 1990, up just
$12 over the period, it said.
   As a result of tax law changes, the report said, wealthy
households pay a smaller percentage of their income in taxes in
1990 than they did in 1980, and lower income households pay a
larger proportion.
   The report cited these other congressional statistics, comparing
1980 and 1990 incomes:
   _Average after-tax income of the poorest fifth of households is
projected to fall 5 percent from 1980 to 1990, after adjustment for
inflation.
   _The middle fifth of households will experience a gain in
after-tax income of less than 3 percent, or just $600.
   _Households in the top fifth will realize an average gain of 33
percent, or $19,000.
   _The richest 1 percent will realize income gains after taxes of
$186,000 after adjusting for inflation, from $214,000 to $400,000.

<HEAD>Bush Moves to Boost Trade with Andean Nations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is moving to stimulate trade
with the four Andean countries of Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia and
Peru as part of his proposal for a free trade zone for the Western
Hemisphere.
   ``These measures will be steps en route to achieving our
ultimate objectives of trade and investment liberalization and
economic reform in the region,'' Bush told Ecuadorian President
Rodrigo Borja in a departure ceremony following their meeting at
the White House on Monday.
   The president proposed:
   _Legislation providing duty-free entry for selected imports from
the Andean region for a transitional period, much as was done in
the Caribbean Basin Initiative approved by Congress six years ago
and now up for extension.
   _A long-term program of expanded cooperation and technical
assistance to help Latin American countries, particularly those in
the Andean region, develop their agriculture.
   _Expanding the favorable tariff treatment already given to the
countries under the Generalized System of Preferences to include 67
products, ranging from frozen pineapple to wood screws, valued at
$26.6 million a year.
   In addition, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills signed a
framework agreement with Ecuador for negotiations of a long-term
undertaking on liberalized trade and investment. Similar agreements
were signed earlier with Bolivia and Colombia.
   The president described the measures as a follow-up to the
proposal he made June 27 in which he said he wants to eliminate
barriers to trade between the United States and the Latin and
Caribbean nations.
   The Ecuadorian president, responding to Bush's farewell remarks,
expressed ``thanks for the important statements that Mr. Bush has
just issued.''
   ``We wish to hold the president and the government of these
people responsible in the future to assist us in their commitment
to achieve the progress and the well-being of Latin America and of
the Caribbean nations,,'' Borja said.
   The Ecuadoran president spoke in Spanish; his remarks were
translated into English by an interpreter.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said Bush also told Borja that about $3 million in Defense
Department equipment and services would be made available to assist
Ecuador in drug-suppression efforts. Aronson said such equipment
might include boats, aircraft and radios.
   Aronson said that in selecting additional items for the
Generalized System of Preferences the administration is required by
law to take into account the effect of the action on U.S.
agricultural and other products.
   He said the same principle is expected to be followed in
drafting the legislation extending the precedent of the Caribbean
Basin Initiative to the Andean countries.

   The ultimate upper-crust loaf has gone on sale in
England, an organic bread named after Prince Charles' Highgrove
estate and containing wheat organically grown at his home farm.
   Tesco supermarket chain began selling Wholemeal Highgrove for
$1.07 a loaf on Tuesday as part of a 12-week trial at 23 Tesco
stores in southeast England.
   The bread is made from wheat grown without pesticides at
Charles' Home Farm at Highgrove, 100 miles west of London, as well
as with Canadian organic wheat.
   Charles agreed to the product to promote organic farming. Last
year, he denounced what he called the excessive use of chemicals in
modern agriculture, and in 1985, he partly converted Home Farm to
organic farming methods.
   The deal involves the projected sale of more than 40,000 loaves,
raising a total of $45,500. Of this, Charles' Duchy of Cornwall
estates will receive about $12,750; the Benevolent Fund, a charity
run by the prince for young people, will receive about $2,250, and
the rest will go to Tesco.

<HEAD>Fraud Caused Only Small Fraction of S&amp;L Losses, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Will be led after 10 a.m. EDT hearing</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just as the Bush administration and Congress
are gearing up to fight savings and loan crooks, a new study
indicates that fraud caused only a small percentage of thrift
losses.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
maintains that fraud cost $5 billion, or only 3 percent of what he
figures is the bailout's $147 billion total cost.
   Most of the losses come from falling real estate values and from
excessive interest rates paid by ailing institutions to attract
depositors, he figures. Bad bailout deals made in 1988 and losses
on junk bonds also contributed.
   Fraud, nevertheless, has become the focus of political debate on
S&amp;Ls. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, making his first
congressional appearance on the subject, and top-banking regulators
were scheduled to testify on the subject today before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
   In other thrift news:
   _The Treasury Department said Monday that the busiest month ever
for the S&amp;L cleanup helped swell the budget deficit to $11.2
billion in June, a month when corporate tax payments normally
produce a surplus.
   _An attorney representing a GOP lobbyist involved in a
much-criticized S&amp;L bailout asked the Senate Ethics Committee to
investigate whether the staff of Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
struck a ``sordid deal'' to share investigative information with
The New York Times.
   The Judiciary Committee's hearing came two weeks after the
Senate overwhelmingly adopted a crime bill including get-tough
provisions aimed at bank and thrift fraud.
   The bill provides $162.5 million in each of the next three years
to increase the number of prosecutors and FBI agents pursuing S&amp;L
cases. It also increased the maximum prison sentence for bank fraud
from 20 years to 30 years and provides a special life sentence to
S&amp;L kingpins. They are defined as those who act in concert with
three others to steal $5 million or more.
   Similar legislation is moving through the House.
   On the witness list today in addition to Thornburgh were L.
William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.;
Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and
John E. Robson, deputy secretary of the Treasury.
   The $11.2 billion June federal budget shortfall, compared with a
$7.8 billion surplus in June 1989, brought red ink for the first
nine months of fiscal 1990 to $163.1 billion, more than half again
as much as the $105.4 billion deficit at this time last year.
   If the deficit continues to accumulate at this pace, it could
top the record deficit of $221.1 billion set in 1986. Analysts
attribute the ballooning budget gap to S&amp;L bailout spending and to
sluggish economic growth, which is producing lower-than-expected
tax revenues.
   Bailout spending by the government's Resolution Trust Corp.
totaled $15.8 billion in June _ a third of its total spending
through June of $45 billion. Eighty-three of the RTC's 207 bailouts
and closings came in June.
   Attorney Stanley M. Brand, representing lobbyist Robert J.
Thompson, a former aide to then-Vice President Bush, asked for a
probe of ``what can only be described as a sordid deal to provide
the Senate's investigative information to a single newspaper in
return for favorable coverage on the eve of the Senate's hearing.''
   Metzenbaum chairs the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust,
monopolies and business rights, which is looking into Thompson's
involvement in negotiating the bailout of 15 thrift institutions
now combined under the name of Bluebonnet Savings Bank of Dallas.
   The Times' story on questions surrounding the bailout appeared
July 8, the day before Metzenbaum held a hearing on the subject.
   Howell Raines, the Times' Washington bureau chief, said, ``As a
matter of policy we don't discuss sources or the editorial
process.'' He said the story was ``meticulously researched from a
number of sources'' and ``was industriously and honorably
reported.''
   Nancy Coffey, a spokeswoman for Metzenbaum, said the senator
considered Brand's complaint too ridiculous to comment on.
   ``Since when is it against the law for a senator to talk to one
reporter?'' she asked, adding that ``no prearrangements'' were
attached to Metzenbaum's comments.
   Meanwhile, the Times reported in today's editions that Thompson
invested $100,000 with a federal regulator, Paul G. Heafy, who also
was involved in Thompson's negotiations to buy an insolvent bank in
Oklahoma.
   The newspaper reported that the investment, which was to buy
distressed loans from federal regulators, did not violate conflict
of interest laws, but Senate investigators wanted to look into the
financing of the deal.
   Heafy is chief liquidator for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in Oklahoma City. The Times said he and Thompson refused the
Times' requests for interviews.

<HEAD>Watermelons Regaining Popularity, USDA Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Watermelons are getting better, easier to
handle and are making a comeback with consumers, the Agriculture
Department says.
   But that's hard to pin down because the USDA _ which readily
publishes estimates of many other crops _ hasn't taken a national
reading of annual watermelon production for almost a decade.
   For many years, says the department's Economic Research Service,
the U.S. watermelon industry showed ``a gradual but persistent
decline'' as production slipped from 31.1 million hundredweight in
1960 to 26.1 million in 1981.
   That was the last year the department officially estimated
watermelon production.
   Although production declined, rising prices boosted the farm
value of watermelons to $159.3 million in 1981, several times what
is was in 1960.
   The report in the August issue of Farmline magazine said U.S.
watermelon consumption on a per capita basis dropped to a record
low of 10.6 pounds by the 1980s from 17.2 pounds in 1960.
   Private researchers, meanwhile, found that consumers thought
large watermelons were inconvenient and that quality was not
consistent. Some of those perceptions are changing.
   The watermelon industry estimates the current farm value of the
crop at about $225 million, with commercial output in about 30
states. Production is estimated at more than 3 billion pounds a
year _ the equivalent of 150 million 20-pound watermelons.
   The report said the rebound has been helped by health-conscious
consumers, greater availability of out-of-season imports, and the
convenience of smaller ``ice box'' melons that can easily fit into
a refrigerator.
   Seedless melons and the marketing of small portions in retail
stores also have been factors, the report said.
   Gary Lucier, one of the report's authors, said Monday in a
telephone interview that 10 states continue to gather and report
watermelon statistics on their own. These produce an estimated 70
percent of the U.S. total.
   Florida is the leading producer. Others include Texas,
California, Georgia, South Carolina, Arizona, Maryland, North
Carolina, Delaware and Hawaii.
   Lucier said USDA would like to begin collecting national
watermelon figures again but that no money is available.
   ``A lot of people would like us to do it, but there just isn't
the budget to do it,'' he said.
   A recent study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest
puts nutritional benefits from watermelon ahead of cantaloupe,
papaya, orange, grapefruit, banana or apple.
   Lucier said the study was based on USDA nutritional information
and noted that a 1-inch-by-10-inch slice weighing 482 grams
supplies 152 calories, 77 percent of the recommended daily
allowance (RDA) of vitamin C, and significant percentages of many
other vitamins and minerals.

   The Agriculture Department says it has
completed another line of defense in Texas against Africanized
honeybees moving north out of Mexico.
   James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said Monday the bees have not yet
entered the United States but are expected to do so between late
summer and next spring.
   Glosser said four interconnected trap lines have been completed
in South Texas to capture and track swarms as they move north out
of Mexico.
   The bees are hybrid offspring of African bees brought to Brazil
in 1956. Some escaped and mated with native bees.
   Africanized bees can be aggressive when threatened and swarm
quickly against an intruder. This characteristic has contributed to
their notoriety as ``killer bees,'' which USDA officials blame on
horror movies and exaggerated news reports.
   ``In reality, the chances of being injured by an Africanized or
any honeybee are far less than the chances of being hit by
lightning,'' said a recent background paper on the bees.
   Glosser said the four trap lines are located north of
Brownsville, Texas, near the Gulf coast. The northernmost line has
more than 40 traps and runs about 50 miles from Sarita to

   Paul Kindinger, the Agriculture Department's
director of public affairs, has resigned to take a job with the
Pentagon's war college.
   Kindinger, 43, joined USDA last August. He will take at endowed
chair at the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, which is part
of the National Defense University at Fort McNair, Washington, D.C.
   The chair, or position, was endowed by USDA and will pay
Kindinger's current salary of $83,600 a year, officials said Monday.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Kindinger will
instruct senior military officers and civilians ``on the importance
of agriculture in the global community and for our national
security.''
   Yeutter said Kindinger will begin instructing during the fall
semester.
   Kindinger was raised on a farm in Reading, Mich., and holds
degrees, including a doctorate, in agricultural economics. Before
joining USDA last year, he had been Michigan state director of
agriculture since 1983.

   Gasoline is the dirtiest in Seattle and the
cleanest in Miami as far as levels of cancer-causing benzene are
concerned, according to a survey by a consumer group.
   The survey released Monday by Citizens Action revealed widely
different levels of toxic ``aromatics,'' especially benzene, in
gasoline depending on regions of the country.
   Benzene and other aromatic additives are used to boost gasoline
octane, but they are highly toxic and are of concern to health
specialists because of motorists' exposure to vapors during
refueling.
   The study found that premium gasoline sold in the West generally
contained higher levels of aromatics, including benzene. An
exception appeared to be Atlanta where the level of benzene in
premium gasoline (2.9 percent) was second only to Seattle (3
percent). Both Los Angeles and San Francisco had benzene levels of
2.7 percent on average.
   The American Petroleum Institute, representing major oil
companies, said benzene content in gasoline nationwide averaged 1.6
percent for regular and 1.7 percent for premium grades nationwide.
Clean air legislation in the final stages of being approved by
Congress calls for refiners to limit their benzene levels to less
than 1 percent.
   Shell premium gasoline sold in Atlanta had the highest content
of benzene of any gasoline tested, 5.4 percent. Exxon's premium in
Los Angeles and Chevron's premium in San Francisco all contained
more than 3.6 percent benzene.
   ``This is gasoline at its dirtiest,'' said Edwin Rothschild,
energy policy director for Citizen Action.
   Taking into account all 18 cities surveyed, Chevron had the
highest average level of benzene _ 2.8 percent for premium and 2
percent for regular.
   The API, responding to the survey, accused Citizen Action of
``misusing data ... to present an unduly alarmist picture of the
health risks'' to motorists. The trade group said exposure levels
to consumers are too low to pose a danger.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that the
cancer risk from routine refueling over a lifetime may be eight
additional cancers per 100,000 people exposed. The risk is higher
for those working at service stations or living near them or near
gasoline refineries, the agency said.
   API spokesman Earl Ross called the regional variations not
unusual. ``Gasolines are blended differently for different parts of
the country,'' he said, because of differences in driving
conditions, climate, altitude and seasonal changes.
   The survey by Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer and
environmental group, was based on gasoline samples tested in 18
cities by the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association.
   The survey found that some gasoline brands already meet the
anticipated clean air requirement being considered by Congress.
   In Miami, where average benzene levels in premium gasoline were
only 1 percent, Mobil's premium had a benzene level of one-half of
1 percent and three other brands _ Union, Amoco and Exxon _ all
contained well below 1 percent benzene. Premium brands by Exxon,
Amoco and Texaco had similar levels in Dallas, Washington D.C., and
Denver.
   But benzene levels varied widely even within single
manufacturers.
   For example, Texaco sold premium gasoline with 0.67 percent
benzene in Denver, but its regular gasoline sold in Boston had
nearly 5 percent benzene content, according to the survey.

<HEAD>Souter's Nomination May Be Difficult to Challenge</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   David Souter, President Bush's candidate for
the Supreme Court, may prove difficult to challenge because his
credentials are largely unquestioned and his views on abortion and
other key ``litmus test'' issues are largely unknown.
   Those may be among his biggest attributes for President Bush,
who said in advance that he wasn't looking for a Senate
confirmation fight. His choice avoided openly antagonizing either
side in the raging abortion debate.
   Liberals are suspicious of the 50-year-old Souter, although they
have no evidence of what his views are on abortion.
   Conservatives are hopeful but wary. Supreme Court justices often
defy predictions about their judicial leanings, and the liberal
whom Souter would replace, Justice William J. Brennan, was
nominated by a Republican president.
   Souter, who was sworn in as a U.S. appeals court judge on April
30, is so new to the federal bench that he has yet to publish an
opinion. As a New Hampshire State Supreme Court justice before
that, he wasn't called on to rule directly on abortion or many
other issues that will confront the nation's highest court.
   Bush said he hadn't discussed abortion or other similar issues
with Souter. In announcing his intention to nominate him Monday, he
praised his ``keen intellect'' and legal ability.
   Thus, by nominating the 50-year-old New Hampshire judge, Bush _
an opponent of abortion _ avoided directly confronting either
advocates or opponents of abortion.
   ``It is not a nomination that immediately will cause a storm of
opposition,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill. ``Like everyone else,
I'm at this point plowing through some of his decisions.''
   ``He cannot be characterized as an ideologue in any way, shape
or form,'' said a friend, Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee's aim in considering whether to
recommend confirmation will be to shed some light on Souter's
judicial record and views _ not only on abortion but perhaps on
affirmative action, criminal justice and other issues that divide
the court.
   But like any good political candidate, this former state
attorney general may know that the more he says on controversial
issues, the more votes he stands to lose.
   Assuming no personal or financial embarrassments are found, how
Souter handles questions on those issues will be the key to his
fate.
   Members of the Judiciary Committee will be under pressure to
find out as much as they can about the man Bush nominated, on
abortion and other issues.
   Abortion rights advocates are demanding that the committee
confront Souter on whether abortion is a constitutionally protected
right and whether he would overturn Roe vs. Wade.
   Souter's nomination to replace Brennan could tip the Supreme
Court's balance on abortion and lead to a reversal of the
17-year-old decision that legalized abortion.
   A year ago, the court allowed greater state restraints on
abortion _ a decision with unpredictable political results.
Pro-choice Democrats won several key elections last year in which
abortion played a role, to the consternation of many Republicans
running this year.
   Bush has made clear he is opposed to abortion and Roe vs. Wade.
But he may not be eager for that political battle before his 1992
re-election campaign.
   Even Souter's friends, such as Rudman and Rep. Chuck Douglas,
R-N.H., who served on the state Supreme Court with him, say they
don't know what Souter thinks about abortion.
   ``We never talked about it,'' Douglas said. ``It never came up.
I can't think of a single case that had anything to do with
abortion while he and I were there.''
   Souter's name was not unknown to court-watchers. He was on
President Reagan's short list in 1987, when the nomination of
Robert Bork brought a monumental Senate fight and eventual
rejection.
   National Right to Life Committee strategist Doug Johnson said
members of his group have no evidence of Souter's views on abortion
but like what they do know.
   By the same token, abortion rights advocates were uneasy. No
small reason is Souter's New Hampshire connection with White House
chief of staff John Sununu, fiercely anti-abortion and the right
wing's point man in the administration, and the state's
conservative Republican senator, Gordon Humphrey.
   Abortion rights advocates are suspicious about the rapid way
Bush acted, too. Rumors that well-known rigid conservatives might
be chosen _ even the suggestion Bush might try Bork again _ may
have made a less-known nominee such as Souter seem a relief to
opponents.

<HEAD>House Joins Senate in Placing New Limits on TV Ads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children would see fewer pitches to buy GI
Joes, Barbie Dolls and sugar-coated breakfast cereals on their
favorite Saturday morning television programs under legislation
nearing final action in Congress.
   By voice vote, the House on Monday approved a bill that would
limit such ads aimed at children to 12 minutes per hour on weekdays
and 10{ minutes an hour on Saturdays and Sundays.
   The legislation would effectively reverse the Reagan
administration's deregulation of commercial content in children's
TV programming in 1984.
   A similar bill that would also create a $10 million National
Endowment for Children's Education Television in the Commerce
Department was approved by the Senate last week.
   The lack of a provision for the endowment in the House version
is the major difference that must be resolved before the bill can
go to the White House.
   Both bills would require regulators to weigh how much
broadcasters are serving the education needs of children when
renewing TV stations' licenses.
   ``Children's television could and should be the video equivalent
of textbooks on the Classics than the video equivalent of a Toys R
Us catalog,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., the principal
author of the House bill.
   Proponents claim the restrictions are necessary because most
children are unable to discriminate between ads and programs until
they reach the age of 4 or 5 and are unable to recognize a sales
pitch as such until they are 7 or 8.
   The House Energy and Commerce Committee estimates the average
child spends 10,000 to 15,000 hours in front of a television set _
more time than in school _ and has been exposed to more than
200,000 TV commercials by the time he or she reaches 18.
   Nearly identical legislation was approved by Congress in 1988
but was pocket-vetoed by President Reagan after Congress had
adjourned for the year and had no chance to override it.
   The Justice Department opposed the bill during hearings this
year and last and said it would urge President Bush to veto it.
Bush, however, has made no commitment on the legislation.
   ``I think the president will sign it and I think most of the
parents will stand behind him when he does,'' said Peggy Charren,
president of Action of Children's Television, an advocacy group
behind the legislation.
   Before the FCC's deregulation in 1984, broadcasters had followed
industry guidelines limiting ads in children's programming to 9{
minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays.
   Since then, according to the House committee, advertising on
many Saturday morning children's shows has crept up to 11 minutes
an hour, compared with an average of 8 minutes of advertising in
every hour of adult programming.

<HEAD>Nunn Says Bush Should Step Up Campaign for B-2 Bomber</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A key Democratic backer of the B-2 bomber is
warning President Bush that unless the administration steps up the
campaign for the stealth aircraft, Congress will kill it.
   The dire prediction by Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn
came Monday as his House Armed Services counterpart, Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis., announced he will join an effort to cancel the
radar-evading plane.
   ``The deficit is growing and the defense budget is shrinking,''
Aspin told reporters prior to his speech on the House floor. ``Much
has happened in the last year, and none of it has been good for the
B-2.''
   Congressional support for the costliest weapon in the military's
arsenal _ at more than $800 million a copy _ has been eroding as
the Soviet threat to the West diminishes and the federal deficit
and price of a single stealth bomber increases.
   The weakening support was the subject of a message sent to Bush
last week by Nunn, D-Ga., and the panel's ranking Republican, John
Warner of Virginia.
   Nunn said late Monday that he indicated to the president that
unless the administration starts lobbying harder for the bomber, it
may fail in the Senate.
   ``I thought that before Aspin made his statement,'' Nunn
stressed in a telephone interview.
   In a statement, Nunn said he did not believe the B-2 ``can be
preserved unless the president, the secretary of defense, the Joint
Chiefs of Staff and our arms control negotiators all argue
forcefully for the program.''
   ``Without this support, the Senate Armed Services Committee
position is unlikely to prevail,'' the senator said.
   In approving a $289 billion defense bill, the Armed Services
Committee agreed to Bush's request for two planes in fiscal 1991.
The full Senate is scheduled to consider the legislation later this
month.
   Aspin, who last year supported limited production of the B-2,
cited the cost, the plane's capabilities and its mission as the
rationale for his decision. Aspin said he found no ``unique and
compelling mission for the B-2.''
   In April, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney revised the Pentagon's
B-2 program _ trimming the budget request for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 from five planes to two and cutting the overall
total from 132 aircraft to 75.
   Scaling back the plan, however, increased the cost of a single
plane from $530 million to $815 million. The Congressional Budget
Office estimated that the cost likely will jump to $865 million
each with the total program's price tag at $65 billion.
   Aspin vowed to work for legislation sponsored by his Armed
Services colleagues _ Reps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., John Rowland,
R-Conn., and John Kasich, R-Ohio _ to stop production at the 15
planes currently in development by the Northrop Corp.
   Proponents of the bill said they have more than the 218 votes
needed to kill the B-2 in the House, and Dellums proclaimed that
the full Congress will terminate the program.
   ``The more American people see and learn about this weapon
system the less support there is,'' Dellums said. ``So I'm going to
stick my neck out and say this is the year that we stop the B-2
bomber.''
   The White House had no reaction to Aspin's announcement, but Air
Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael J. Dugan told reporters at the
Pentagon that Aspin's ``voice carries some extra weight, and we'd
hoped that we wouldn't have to fight that extra weight.''
   Dugan vowed that the service would step up its lobbying in the
House for the bat-winged aircraft and warned that killing the
program would ``send a message to friend and foe alike that the
United States has lost its stomach'' for defense.
   Another proponent of the B-2, Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., urged
that the Bush administration argue a better case for the bomber.
Skelton's district includes Whiteman Air Force Base where a B-2
wing will be based.
   ``I understand they will be inviting people down to the White
House soon,'' he said. ``It may be a day late and a dollar short.''

<HEAD>Early on, NASA Managers Worried About Hubble Mirror Maker's Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The flawed mirrors that have crippled the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope were a worry for NASA officials even
as the agency was selecting a contractor for the telescope optics,
according to a 1977 report.
   The report, released by NASA on Monday after a request by The
Associated Press, said officials selected Perkin-Elmer Corp. of
Danbury, Conn., to make the Hubble optical assembly, even though
the company planned to use an unproven computer-driven system in
the critical mirror polishing.
   Engineers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
now believe that a flaw manufactured into one of the mirrors by
Perkin-Elmer blurred the vision of the Hubble telescope, reducing
its effectiveness by at least 50 percent. The error is now under
investigation.
   The report, signed on Aug. 26, 1977 by then-NASA Administrator
Robert A. Frosch, said the bid by Perkin-Elmer, now Hughes Danbury
Optical Systems Inc., was preferred over a bid by Eastman Kodak Co.
for several reasons, including cost.
   Officials evaluating the two contract bids rated Perkin-Elmer as
``very good'' and Kodak as ``good.''
   ``Our only concern about the Perkin-Elmer approach centers
around their plan to utilize an as-yet unverified
computer-controlled mirror polishing technique,'' the report said.
   It noted, however, that the concern was ``alleviated'' because
the selection board knew that Perkin-Elmer had ``other proven and
reliable techniques'' that could be used ``in the event that their
computer technique is not perfected and verified in time for use on
the OTA (optical telescope assembly) program.
   ``Based upon this information, we believe Perkin-Elmer has the
ability to successfully polish the primary mirror,'' the report
added.
   The report was cosigned by A.M. Lovelace, deputy NASA
administrator, and John E. Naugle, NASA associate administrator.
   One weakness in the Perkin-Elmer proposal, the report said, was
the firm's ``unsubstantiated accuracy of focus sensor test
equipment.''
   This equipment is among the items impounded by a NASA committee
that is investigating the manufacture of the Hubble mirrors. That
panel, led by Lew Allen, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
is to meet at the manufacturer's offices in Danbury on Wednesday.
   Perkin-Elmer sold its optical division to Hughes Aircraft Co.
and the company is now known as Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc.
Officials at Hughes Danbury either declined to be interviewed about
the NASA report or could not be reached by telephone.
   In their 1977 report, the NASA officials said ``the single most
significant technical discriminator'' that tilted the selection to
Perkin-Elmer was the approach used by the Connecticut company in
making a fine guidance sensor, the device that is used to aim the
telescope. It said the Perkin-Elmer approach was a ``cost
effective'' design.
   The officials also noted that they were ``quite surprised at the
large difference in cost favoring Perkin-Elmer'' in the bids. They
said the Kodak proposal on the fine guidance system was three times
more costly than that of Perkin-Elmer.
   Perkin-Elmer was given the Hubble contract at about $62 million,
but overruns drove the actual cost up to $451 million by the time
the telescope was launched from a space shuttle on April 25.
   NASA officials concluded in the report that Perkin-Elmer
``clearly won the competition'' based on ``mission suitability''
and because the Connecticut firm would be ``the lowest cost
producer.''

filmmaker, the talk of the Cannes Film Festival and a Hollywood
maverick.
   But residents of the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, where he
has opened a store that sells memorabilia from his movies, insist
he's still one of their own.
   ``You have to respect Spike,'' said Marc Sweeting, 20, a student
who looked over T-shirts after Spike's Joint opened Monday. Lee's
latest movie, ``Mo' Better Blues,'' had its premiere in Manhattan
the same day.
   ``He came from Brooklyn. He makes his movies in Brooklyn. And he
put his store right here. He didn't go off to Hollywood with
everything,'' Sweeting said.
   Spike's Joint offers T-shirts, posters, books, caps, postcards
and other items celebrating such movies as ``Do The Right Thing,''
``She's Gotta Have It'' and ``School Daze.''
   Lee, 33, lives in Fort Greene, where several scenes from his
movies have been filmed.
   He said he opened the store because he was besieged by fan mail
and phone calls requesting buttons, T-shirts and other movie
memorabilia.
   Lee said he hopes to use profits from the store to finance movie

   The co-host of NBC's ``Today'' show told New York magazine she
hailed a cab driven by Isidro Ortiz.
   When she arrived at her destination, Norville said, she tapped
on the partition window to tell Ortiz where to drop her off. She
said Ortiz cursed her and became more abusive when she began to
write down his license number.
   Norville said she refused to give him a tip and Ortiz slammed
shut the money vent and sent the fare flying. A coin struck her in
the eye, she said.
   ``I was absolutely shaking when I got out of the car,'' she was
quoted as saying in the magazine's July 30 issue.
   Ortiz, 31, was fined $100 at a hearing April 2, said Rebecca

   The man chosen by President Bush to be the
next Supreme Court justice is being described as a cautious
conservative, an agile thinker and a judge hardly known outside his
home state of New Hampshire.
   David H. Souter, who would be the nation's 105th justice if
confirmed by the Senate, has an extensive record as a state judge
that reveals little inclination toward sweeping pronouncements or
rulings.
   ``It would be very surprising if he turned out to be anything
but a conservative'' likely to be allied on the high court with
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and
Anthony M. Kennedy, said University of Virginia Law Professor A.E.
Dick Howard.
   Preliminary assessments of Souter's judicial philosophy were
based less on his writings and rulings than on who his friends and
political allies are.
   Souter was a state trial judge for five years before he was
appointed to the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1983 by then-Gov.
John Sununu. Sununu now is Bush's chief of staff and considered by
many to be the leading White House advocate for conservative causes.
   Souter also has the enthusiastic support of Sen. Warren Rudman,
a moderate New Hampshire Republican.
   Rudman, who as state attorney general years ago hired Souter,
once said his protege possesses ``the most brilliant legal mind''
he had ever encountered.
   Bush repeatedly said Monday he picked Souter without examining
the nominee's position on abortion, and there is barely a clue as
to how Souter might rule on the issue.
   In a 1986 case before the New Hampshire Supreme Court, Souter
joined the majority in ruling that doctors have a responsibility to
test for birth defects and inform pregnant women of the option of
abortion.
   ``We recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves
controversial and divisive social issues,'' said the opinion.
``Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that
a woman has a constitutionally secured right to terminate a
pregnancy.''
   In a concurring opinion, Souter questioned the impact the
decision would have on doctors who oppose abortion on moral
grounds. He said such physicians should not have to choose
``between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures.''
   Conservatives and Republicans say they are reluctant to jump to
conclusions without further examination of Souter's record.
   Nan Aron of the liberal Alliance for Justice said that based on
her preliminary soundings, Souter ``can be characterized as a
moderate conservative.''
   John Scully of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation said
``we're not celebrating'' but are optimistic that conservatives
will be able to rally behind Souter.
   Souter went through Senate confirmation hearings when Bush named
him to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this year. But
his experience on the federal bench is so limited that his
biography is not included in the official directory of federal
judges.
   He is more familiar to legal observers back home.
   ``He does not pay any attention to the emotional, political
aspects (of cases before him),'' said Stanley M. Brown, a
Manchester, N.H., lawyer and a former American Bar Association
officer. ``He doesn't go out blazing new pathways. That's not his
forte.''
   In an interview published in May in Massachusetts Lawyers
Weekly, Souter said he doesn't like being described as a ``strict
constructionist.''
   ``On constitutional matters, I am of the interpretivist
school,'' he said. ``We're not looking for the original
application, we're looking for meaning here. That's a very
different thing.''
   Souter was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state Supreme Court
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints.
The nation's highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this
year.
   He also was part of a 3-2 majority when the state Supreme Court
in 1986 allowed the main owner of the Seabrook nuclear plant to
sell bonds needed to complete the long-entangled project. The court
rejected appeals by state consumer advocates and environmentalists.
   In one of the rare civil rights cases in which Souter
participated, he joined the state Supreme Court's ruling in 1987
that said homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or
foster parents. But the state court said in that decision that
homosexuals may not be barred from running day care centers.
   People for the American Way, a liberal group, said its review of
Souter's state Supreme Court record indicates he ``interprets
constitutional guarantees narrowly, especially in criminal cases.''
   The organization criticized Souter for an opinion that
overturned a sexual assault conviction. Souter held that the
defendant should have been allowed to present testimony that the
victim behaved in a sexually provocative manner toward several men
in a tavern, the group said.

   David H. Souter shook hands with President
Bush on Monday afternoon for the first time, then sat down in the
White House family quarters for a 45-minute chat.
   A few hours later, Bush was introducing Souter as his nominee to
be the next U.S. Supreme Court justice _ less than 72 hours after
William J. Brennan stepped down from the court.
   Although his nomination unfolded with surprising speed,
administration officials said that they've had an eye on Souter for
some time.
   Shortly after he took office, Bush asked the Justice Department
and White House staff to put together a list of potential Supreme
Court nominees. Souter's name was placed on that list early last
year.
   He was bought to the attention of Justice Department judicial
candidate screeners by White House chief of staff John Sununu, said
a senior administration official. As governor of New Hampshire,
Sununu had appointed Souter to that state's highest court.
   Souter's name came up again last fall when officials were
searching for someone to fill a vacancy on the 1st Circuit Court of
Appeals in Boston. He underwent a series of interviews last year
and Bush nominated him to that court on Jan. 24.
   After the American Bar Association gave him its highest rating _
``well qualified'' _ the Senate confirmed Souter on April 27. He
joined the 1st Circuit only in May and hasn't had the opportunity
to publish any rulings.
   Souter's name came up again Saturday morning when Bush, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, Sununu and White House counsel Boyden Gray
met to launch their weekend search for new justice, said another
senior official.
   ``We know this man because we had this man through our judicial
process last fall,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   At Saturday's meeting, Bush was given background materials on a
dozen or so potential candidates to study over the weekend,
officials said. The president added several names for
consideration, which were given a ``cursory check'' by those
assigned to review the candidates, the official said.
   White House and Justice Department officials met throughout the
weekend.
   No ``short list'' was drawn up, but on Monday, Bush arranged to
conduct two interviews, one with Souter and another with a
candidate whom administration officials declined to identify.
   The president talked with Souter in the family quarters of the
White House and later filled three legal-sized pages with ``his
handwritten feelings or conclusions about the candidate,'' said
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   While Souter waited elsewhere in the White House, Bush weighed
the ``strengths and weaknesses'' of Souter and two other
candidates, then wrote out three more pages before making up his
mind, Fitzwater said.
   After a two-hour wait, Souter was called to the Oval Office,
where Bush offered him the nomination.

   Under the U.S. system of separation of powers,
it is the president's job to choose Supreme Court nominees and the
Senate's role to confirm or reject them.
   Twenty-seven high court nominees in the nation's history have
failed to win Senate confirmation, only seven in this century.
   Most recently, the Senate in 1987 blocked President Reagan's
appointment of Robert Bork to fill a vacancy created by the
retirement of Justice Lewis F. Powell.
   The Senate vote was 58-42, with six Republicans joining 52
Democrats in opposing Bork.
   Reagan's second choice, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew after
revealing he had smoked marijuana. The Senate then confirmed
Reagan's third pick, Anthony M. Kennedy.

   Here is the text of President Bush's
announcement of his intention to nominate David H. Souter to the
Supreme Court.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   My oath to the Constitution charges me to faithfully execute the
Office of President, and to the best of my ability preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Few
duties are more important in discharging that obligation than my
responsibility under Article 2, Section 2 of our Constitution to
select from among all possible choices one nominee to fill a
vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States.
   The task of narrowing the selection to one highly qualified
jurist committed to the rule of law and faithful to the
Constitution could never be easy, but I have found it enormous _
enormously satisfying. My choice will serve the Court and the
Constitution well.
   I am most pleased to announce that I will nominate as associate
justice of the United States Supreme Court a remarkable judge of
keen intellect and the highest ability, one whose scholarly
commitment to the law and whose wealth of experience mark him of
first rank _ Judge David Souter of the United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit.
   Judge Souter, I believe with all my heart, will prove a most
worthy member of the court. His tenure as an associate justice of
the Supreme Court of the state of New Hampshire, as attorney
general of that state, and more recently as a federal appeals
judge, unquestionably demonstrates his ability, his integrity, and
his dedication to public service. And he has a keen appreciation of
the proper judicial role rooted in fundamental belief and
separation of powers and the democratic principles underlying our
great system of government.
   Let me pay tribute, too, to the justice whose retirement from
the court created the vacancy, Justice William Brennan. His
powerful intellect, his winning personality, and importantly his
commitment to civil discourse on emotional issues that at times
tempt uncivil voices have made him one of the greatest figures of
our age.
   No one can question his dedication to the nation and the energy
that he has brought to his high office. His retirement is marked by
the dignity and honor that characterized his 34 years of service on
the bench. And I told him the other day when I talked to him of the
respect that Mrs. Bush and I have for him for his wonderful service.
   In choosing to nominate Judge Souter, who like Justice Brennan
is largely a product of the state court system, I have looked for
the same dedication to public service and strength of intellect
exemplified by Justice Brennan.
   My selection process was not geared simply to any legal issue.
It is not appropriate in choosing a Supreme Court justice to use
any litmus test. And I want a justice who will ably and fairly
interpret the law across the range of issues the Court faces. Our
country serves as a model for the world at a time of special
significance, and I stressed within the White House to the attorney
general that our process could not be dominated by politics or
special interests. And I believe that we've set a good example of
selecting a fair arbiter of the law.
   Judge Souter will bring to the Court a wealth of judicial
experience on the Supreme Court of his state and, before that, as a
state trial court judge. Prior to his appointment to the state
bench, he was attorney general of the state of New Hampshire.
   Judge Souter is a graduate of the Harvard Law School, Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of Harvard College. He was also a Rhodes Scholar.
   My respect for his outstanding record led me earlier this year
to nominate him to his present position on the court of appeals.
The Senate unanimously confirmed him to that position because of
his exceptional qualities and his experience.
   His opinions reflect a clean intellect _ keen intellect as well
as wise balance between the theoretical and practical aspects of
the law. Judge Souter committed to interpreting, not making the
law. He recognizes the proper role of judges in upholding the
democratic choices of the people through their elected
representatives with constitutional constraints.
   Judge Brennan's retirement took effect last Friday. The Court is
now reduced to eight members. It is important to restore the bench
to full strength by the first Monday in October when the Court
begins its 1990 term. I look forward to presenting Judge Souter's
nomination to the Senate as quickly as possible, and I look forward
as well to a fair and expeditious confirmation process.

<TEXT>
   Q: Did you ask Judge Souter his views on abortion? Do you know
what his views are? And affirmative action? All of these things
that have become so controversial, the major issues of the day?
   Bush: No. And I had one meeting with Judge Souter. I was very
impressed but, in my view, it would have been inappropriate to ask
him his views on specific issues. This process has been going on,
this selection process, not with any specific seat in mind, but
just being prepared for a long, long time. Judge Souter was
considered for the High Court back when Mr. Justice Kennedy was
selected. And so there's a lot _ and then, of course, his name was
very much in the forefront when he was nominated and subsequently
confirmed for the Appeals Court.
   So I am familiar with him, with his, his general views, but I
did not and would not, as I think I've said before when I talked
about _ not just here, but other times _ the litmus test approach.
I wouldn't go into that with him.
   Q: Does that mean you do not care what he thinks on the ...
   Bush: It means that I have selected a person who will interpret
the Constitution and, in my view, not legislate from the federal
bench.
   Q: Mr. President, barely three days have passed since you
learned of Justice Brennan's resignation. Why did you move so
quickly on this appointment? And you also called the leaders of
Congress, and others, over the weekend for their advice. When did
you come to the choice of Justice Souter?
   Bush: I came to the choice this afternoon and wanted to _ I
think I told the leaders that I talked to over the weekend that I
wanted to move very fast. As I said, this isn't precipitous in the
sense that we just started looking for names last Saturday. I
remember meeting with the Attorney General and Boyden Gray, perhaps
within the first month I was President _ at least the first two
months. And I've had a couple of meetings with them, and they've
been in discussion with each other for a long time on this. And so
just the prudence would dictate that one be prepared lest there be
a vacancy. So we've been talking about who I might want to appoint
for a long time.
   Q: Sir, if I could follow up, you're not certain in your own
mind how Justice Souter will vote if Roe v. Wade comes before the
Court next term?
   Bush: What I'm certain of is that he will interpret the
Constitution and not legislate from the federal bench.
   Yes?
   Q: But, Mr. President, I believe Judge Souter is about 50 years
old, and many of the candidates you considered were younger than
the current justices. What kind of lasting legacy do you want to
leave on the Supreme Court? Do you expect this to be a long-term
shifting of the center of balance for the Court?
   Bush: I'm not looking _ he's in good health. I was looking over
there to see how he's looking at 50 _ but he seems to be in very
vigorous health, and I would expect he'd serve a long term on the
bench. And I'm not viewing this as some personal ``Bush imprint''
on the Court. I have pledged to get, to seek out excellence, and
I've pledged to look for somebody who would interpret the
Constitution, and I'm satisfied I've found the very best in that
regard.
   Q: Do you expect the Court would shift to the right
philosophically?
   Bush: I haven't put it in terms of shifting left or right. I
read a great deal of speculation about all that, but all I'm saying
is that we've got a nominee here who is extraordinarily
intelligent, has a record, has been confirmed by the Senate, and
who has satisfied inquiry at the state and federal level as to his
objectivity and as to his judicial philosophy. And I am satisfied
as to all those counts.
   Q: Mr. President, as you know, the whole issue of abortion has _
over this choice is major ... Do you know if this judge has written
on this issue? Has _ is he _ does he have a record on this issue
that either side can point to to make it an even bigger issue? Or
is he _ is it unknown and therefore more difficult to get at?
   Bush: In the first place, I think it would be inappropriate,
although I'll let him make up his own mind for Justice Souter to
make any comments on any specific issue. Out of the respect for the
Senate, I would urge that he not do that. Any specific questions on
specific issues should be addressed in an orderly confirmation
process by the Senate. But, beyond that, Lesley, I _ you know, I
think what I said earlier responds to your question.
   Q: No, I _ you said you hadn't asked him, but I wonder if he has
a record, if ...
   Bush: Well, I don't know about that. I didn't consider that, as
I thought I made clear. Yeah, Jerry? And then ...
   Q: Mr. President, since you concluded that it's inappropriate to
ask about a specific case like Roe versus Wade, do you also
therefore consider it to be inappropriate for the Senate committee
that'll do the confirmation to ask about a specific case like that?
   Bush: I would let the Senate do whatever they want. They're a
separate and independent body of the _ of our government, and there
are certain precedents for how they approach these issues, but I'm
_ listen, I've got enough problems down here without trying to tell
the Senate how to conduct its confirmation hearing. I've been
handed a protocol note. Marlin Fitzwater, who's not known for his
protocol, but I _ he says it would be most appropriate to let Judge
Souter respond at this juncture. So, with your permission, we'll
proceed.
   Judge Souter: Thank you, Mr. President. I'm really not sure how
to do that. If it were possible for me to express to you the
realization that I have of the honor which the President has just
done me, I would try and I would keep you here as long tonight as I
had to do to get it out. But I could not express that realization
and I'm not going to try to do the impossible. Beyond that, I hope
you will understand that I think I must defer any further comments
of mine until I am before the Senate in the confirmation process.

   Q: Conservatives recently have expressed some disappointment
with your _ what they call the flip-flop on ``no new tax'' pledge,
your position on China, Lithuania, and the like. And Governor
Sununu is recognized as the champion of the conservatives in the
White House. Is his connection _ is the Judge's connection to
Governor Sununu, is this meant as an appeasement to the
conservative right? Do you think it will appease them?
   Bush: Sununu's got problems with his own credentials. I mean,
he's not going to help on that. And that's not what this is all
about. This matter, as I've indicated, was _ there was almost a
certain recusal on the part of Governor Sununu on this. Clearly, he
knows Judge Souter. He has great respect for Judge Souter. But this
process, as I'm sure Boyden Gray and Dick Thornburgh will tell you,
came up through a system. Excellence came to the top. And, so,
there is no politics of this nature in this kind of a _ this kind
of an appointment. If I was looking to shore up one factor or
another, there'd be plenty of more visible ways to do it. Here, we
are talking about excellence, judicial excellence, and the highest
degree of qualification, based on excellence, to be on the Court.
   Q: Mr. President, earlier today, Marlin Fitzwater said that
whomever you chose as your candidate, your nominee, would reflect
your general philosophy of government. Is it still your philosophy
that Roe vs. Wade, the abortion law, should be overturned?
   Bush: Look, you all can keep trying all day long to get me to
comment on abortion in relation to this nomination. And please keep
_ stop trying because I'm not going to respond in that vein. It
would be unfair to Judge Souter. It would be untrue because I
haven't looked at the nomination in that manner. And so, I simply
cannot _ and you get another question though, instead.
   Q: Well, my other question would simply be, just not respond in
the connection with Judge Souter. How about just your own personal
philosophy?
   Bush: I haven't changed my views, if that helps any.
   Q: Mr. President, I'm still not totally certain by why you feel
it was inappropriate to ask the Judge's views on the issues _
   Bush: Because that's _ I understand that's the customary way of
doing it, and that more important are the broad concepts of
excellence. Is the man qualified? Does he share a broad view that
what he ought to do on the bench is interpret the Constitution and
not legislate. And so that's all I need. And when you see the
background of this man, I'm confident the Senate will share my
views. You're looking for fairness. You're looking for equity.
   I wrote down a bunch of words to help me make the determination,
and I wish I had them because they're all along that _ those lines.
Experience. And I did say that I'd like somebody that will
interpret the Constitution, not legislate.
   Q: But can you even be sure of that, sir? Does that mean that
you've at least studied some of his rulings?
   Bush: There has been a great deal of work done in the Justice
Department at several levels, in our General Counsel's shop, on all
that kind of thing. But again, it would be inappropriate to go into
those cases that he may have ruled on when he was on the state
court or on the federal bench, and I would simply leave that to the
Senate. But, yes, there has been a thorough study of Judge Souter's
tremendously impressive record.
   Q: Mr. President, given the reality of getting a person
confirmed to the Supreme Court these days, are you braced for a big
battle?
   Bush: Well, I don't _ I'm not going into this nomination, or
thrusting Judge Souter into the nomination, expecting a highly
contentious battle. The man was confirmed by the Senate,
unanimously, and _ after testimony. So, I'm not suggesting there's
going to have to be or should be. I remember calmer days when there
weren't. So I would not anticipate a contentious battle. I would
anticipate thorough questioning. I would anticipate each Senator,
having enough information to make up his or her mind, based on the
record or responses to questions. But, no, I'm not _ we're not
bracing for some horrendous fight with the United States Senate,
and given his record, I would expect that the chances of that are
minimal.

   Q: Do you think a President these days has to do more of a
selling job than in the past?
   Bush: I don't know, Maureen. I don't think so, if the record
speaks for itself. If I'd have selected somebody out of the
political arena that had never been on the bench and never had any
experience but was in my view well qualified, there might well have
been more intervention on my part. I'm prepared to do whatever is
appropriate in not only defending but advocating this confirmation,
but I don't believe there's going to be a lot of personal
involvement necessary because I think his record and his standing
will speak for itself.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, I've got to make one more try. You say it's
inappropriate to ask, but you also admit there is a lot of
background paperwork on someone. Judge Souter was appointed to the
New Hampshire court by Governor Sununu, whose feelings on abortion
are well known. Your feelings on abortion are well known. Why
should we not believe that that is a factor in your selection?
   Bush: Because I've told you it's not, and because you ought to
listen to the testimony in the Hill, and then you can make up your
mind better when you've seen the evidence. And that _ I expect
people will be raising this question. I've seen a lot of
speculation on it over the last 48 hours or whatever it was since
Justice Brennan retired. But I'm telling you _ you asked me what my
view was _ and I've told you how I approach this matter, and that's
all I can do.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, you said a moment ago that there are Senate
precedents on how questioning happens in the Judiciary Committee.
In fact, there are two very contrasting precedents. There was the
Bork precedent, where the nominee answered all sorts of questions,
and there was the Justice O'Connor-Justice Kennedy precedent, in
which the nominee declined to an lot of specific questions about
how the nominee felt. Do you have any preference about how your
nominee handles these questions?
   Bush: No, but I have confidence my nominee will handle it
properly, and he's _ look, the man is a judge on an appeals court.
He knows how to treat with this, and the Senate is a free Senate,
and they know how to treat with it. So that _ I'm not going to get
into that. I think it's inappropriate for a President to do that
kind of thing.
   Q: Do you tt's appropriate for a nominee to answer specific
questions about how he might rule on _
   Bush: I would leave, and let the Senate make the final
determination.
   Yes? Were there one or two aspects of the judge's background
that _ alifications that particularly brought him to th Bush: Being
bright, extraordinarily bright and then a record foess,
extraordinarily fair. Well, I've made my judgment based _ you've
asked me what I decided ifications that I think are essential. Plus
I gave you the underpinning, which I want somebody that is not
going to be a legislator sitting on the Supreme Court.
   Yeah? And then Ann.
   Q: Did you meet Judge Souter before you made this decision other
than the last couple of days?
   Bush: Yes, just within the last couple of days.
   Q: _ the first time you've ever seen him?
   Bush: First time I'd met him. And who knows, the amounI spent in
New Hampshire I might well have seen him. But I _ (laughter) we've
been, as I have indicated, been talking to our attorney general and
Boyden Gray on resumes, or on records for a long, long time. And
the man is very highly regarded, so _ but I _ no, I just had a
short visit with Judge Souter today and, obviously, was quite
impressed.
   Yes, Ann?
   Q: You had already decided at that point, sir?
   Bush: No, I had not decided, and that's the truth _ as is
everything else I said here. (Laughter.) Yeah Q: In _ in speaking
to your advisors about resumes and records, as you say, did you ask
your advisors to produce only nominees who had no extensive written
record on the abortion issue _
   Bush: No.
   Q: _ that _ (inaudible) _ more candidates who would not provoke
a large debate over _
   Bush: No.
   Yeah, Owen?
   Q: I wonder if you can you tell me, how is it possible to make
the selection without reviewing the judge's record or a summary of
his record that dealt with sic cases, if not abortion, affirmative
action, civil rights issues, free speech _ a lot of the emotional
issues that the country is very concerned about?
   Bush: Most of hve been at the state level and the _ the _ I made
the decision based on the criteria that I gave you.
   Q: So you're telling us that you have no idea what his judicial
opinions are on abortion, affirmative action and civil rights, flag
burning?
   Bush: I'm telling you that you should stay tuned and let the
testimony before the United States Senate determine whether he's
confirmed or not, and that that ll bring out all the questions that
you're aski And the answers, that's up to the judge to see how he
should hhat as one who is going to have to deal with a lot of
issues in future.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, has Gnor Sununu, who is well acquainted with
the nominee, given you reading on the Judge's views on
controversial issues?
   Bush: No, there's _ no. No.

   Q: I wonder if you could tell me, sir, you extolled the Judge's

confirmed by the Senate for his present position, can you think of
any reason, any possibility, the Senate would not confirm the Judge

Period.

body. I don't control the Senate. I would hope they would accept
the _ when they've had a chance to ask questions and they've had a
chance to review his record, would conclude, as I have, that he is
outstandingly well-qualified for the federal bench, a judgment that
was given to him not too long ago by the ABA itself.
Well-qualified, which I gather is the highest rating a judge can
have.
   Q: You had said you're not interested in making a Bush imprint
on the Court. You may also be _
   Bush: I have to, I guess, but I'm not interested in having this
known as a Bush Court or something of that nature.
   Q: Well, you may be called upon throughout your term to actually
name one or two others. Do you have those in mind? And also, if _
   Bush: Yes.
   Q: By having those names in mind of who you would appoint, are
you doing the same thing like in foreign policy, saying that you
want to choose a prudent man or that the imprint would be something
peculiar to you, in other words a _
   Bush: Look, I'll tell you how I look at this, not in terms of
some specific imprint, but I want it said when I'm about _ let's
see, 66 _ about 90, 24 years from now, that I made a superb choice,
and I think it will be so writ.
   Q: Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the phrase you're
using on you're opposed to somebody who would legislate from the
bench. You're on record as wanting Roe vs. Wade overturned. You're
on record as favoring a flag-burning amendment to the Constitution.
Aren't those sorts of issues tantamount to legislating from the
bench as well?
   Bush: Well, what _ you'd have to tell me the case and advise me
as to how _ I don't think so. I don't think, when called upon to
answer a constitutional question, that that has to be legislating
from the bench.
   Q: But you would not be upset if the Court overturned Roe vs.
Wade?
   Bush: No.
   Q: Or if the Court upheld the flag-burning amendment?
   Bush: No, and a lot of other things, too. I believe in the
separation of powers. I happen to think that there's been a _ many,
many things have troubled me, encroachment of micro-management by
the United States Congress on the presidency. But I haven't asked
this able judge about those things. But I could cite _ you cite
two. You cite one that's been on everybody's lips ever since I _
since Justice Brennan retired. Listen, I never heard such coverage
on the television. You might just think the whole nomination had
something to do with abortion. And it's far broader than that. I
have too much respect for the Supreme Court than to look at one
specific issue and one alone. I've got time for one _ yeah, Kathy?
   Q: Mr. President, there's been some speculation you might name
an Hispanic this time and make history in doing so. You went a
different route. What do you say to those who might be disappointed
that didn't happen, and what is the likelihood you might name an
Hispanic should another vacancy develop?
   Bush: First, I say to whoever it is that inquires, I've made the
best choice I possibly could make in terms of qualifications,
ability, background, and temperament to serve on this court. And
then I say: Look, the great thing about this country is you can
achieve anything. And there's a lot of time down the road in which
I'm sure you'll see a different makeup on the Court. But I don't _
I'm not going to deal in any one specific group, vis-a-vis another
one. And that's what I would say. But I just would ask the American
people to understand I looked at a wide array of names prior to my
getting into it in as much depth as I have very recently. The
Attorney General, his staff, Boyden Gray and his staff, went
through this process. It's a continuance _ it's a process that's
been going on for some time. And this _ the excellence was just
there at the top. And so, I would not cite this as something
discouraging for anybody that aspires to the Supreme Court or any
group that would aspire to have representation on the Supreme
Court. Listen, I really do have to go _
   Q: What did you ask him when you interviewed him?
   Q: Did you interview the other finalists, Mr. President? Did he
win in the interview?
   Bush: He did very, very well.
   Q: Two or three _
   Bush: Yeah, let me get one _ I've been _ I failed to _
   Q: Two or three of the candidates that were mentioned were from
your home state and there was talk that you perhaps would choose
somebody from the South because you felt the South was in
under-representation since Justice Powell resigned. Wasn't anybody
qualified in the South or why did you _
   Bush: No, there's plenty of people qualified and you raise a
good point because there aren't _ there is nobody from the _ what I
would call the Southeast conference South, but the South, excluding
Texas, that _ that is on the bench now. And there's about a quarter
of the people from there. So, this is a consideration and was a
consideration; it was forcefully brought home to me by key members
of Congress. And yet I determined that Judge Souter, given the
qualifications I've tried to extoll here, the virtues, is the
choice for the federal _ for the Supreme Court at this time.
   But no, these calls are not easy. And Kathy asked about
different ethnic groups. You asked about regional distribution. And
I think one considers all these _ all these criteria. I think it's
fair to say that New England, which is not represented on the bench
now that Justice Brennan is retired, might look at it, if I had
gone with another nominee, as why were they excluded? So, I can
understand regionalism. But, please believe me, as a proud Texan, I
tried to look at it on a _ in a national sense. And I think I've
come up with the best nominee. Jesse, I'm sorry to disappoint you _
   Q: A very quick follow-up, if I could. Senator Simpson suggested
that you follow the counsel of Mrs. Bush. Did you in any way on
this particular issue?
   Bush: How did he know? He doesn't even know who I nominated. How
could he have said that?
   Q: He said that he hoped that that would be what you would do.
   Bush: Oh, I see. Wonderful fellow, Al.

   Minnesota, which last voted for a Republican
presidential candidate in 1972, has a new conservative think tank
aimed at challenging liberals on their own turf.
   The Center of the American Experiment may seem out of place in
the land of prairie liberalism. Its founder says that's the point.
   ``We are purposely going after the most difficult, the nastiest
issues we face as a state and as a nation,'' said Mitchell
Pearlstein, the center's founder and president.
   The center opened in March and held its first conference, on
poverty, in April. A conference titled ``What Do We Do When School
Reform Fails?'' is scheduled for Nov. 16. The center plans to
publish papers, hold more forums and deliver recommendations on
such issues as drugs, welfare and taxes.
   Minnesota is where Hubert H. Humphrey and his protege, Walter F.
Mondale, got their start in politics.
   It is the only state to vote for Democratic candidates in all
three presidential races in the 1980s. Richard Nixon was the last
Republican to carry Minnesota, when he defeated George McGovern in
1972.
   ``Conservative ideas are not terribly well attended to in this
state, in part because they're not terribly well articulated,''
Pearlstein said. ``You can say that the niche is that much larger.''
   Pearlstein, 42, had another reason for establishing the center
in Minnesota. He wanted to come home.
   A former speechwriter for Gov. Al Quie in 1981-82, then
editorial page writer for what is now the Saint Paul Pioneer Press,
he left for Washington in 1987 to work for the Education
Department. But Pearlstein, who grew up in Far Rockaway, N.Y., and
later moved to Binghamton, N.Y., longed for Minnesota.
   ``I tell people about 20 minutes after getting to Washington, I
started to conspire to return home,'' he said. ``This is literally
where I want to die.''
   The center is nonpartisan, but most of its 12 directors and 16
advisers are Republicans. Two Democrats have joined the board of
advisers, and more Democrats will be added, Pearlstein said.
   Republican Sens. Dave Durenberger and Rudy Boschwitz are on the
board of advisers.
   Five members of the boards of directors and advisers are black
or Hispanic, and five are women.
   ``We have very much an interest in changing the imagery of
conservatives ... as a very white male idea,'' Pearlstein said.
   Rep. Vin Weber, a Republican on the board of advisers, believes
the time is right for a conservative think tank in Minnesota.
   ``I think activist states will find their successes copied
around the country,'' Weber said. ``So if the center is successful
in formulating some new responses to old problems in Minnesota,
they're in a significant moment in history to have a significant
national impact.''
   Former St. Paul Mayor George Latimer, a liberal, said he
welcomes any fresh approach to social problems but was disappointed
after the center's conference on poverty.
   ``I saw them trotting in a lot of people who have published
their ideological tracts. They brought out their conservative
Hispanic, their conservative black, their conservative
intellectual,'' Latimer said.
   ``They were not listening; they were being ideologues.''
   Pearlstein is the only full-time staff member at the center,
which has a first-year budget of $250,000. Funding comes from
individuals, corporations and foundations, he said, adding there
are no plans to take government money.

   Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter is a
quiet, hard-working judge who lives an ``almost monastic life'' but
can skewer stuffed shirts with his sharp sense of humor, friends
say.
   Friends, colleagues and lawyers who know Souter, 50, described
him as an intellectual and a man with a deep respect for the
Constitution. President Bush nominated him Monday to replace
retired Justice William J. Brennan.
   ``I don't think the president could have nominated a person with
better qualities, background, a keener intellect, than David
Souter,'' Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., a close friend, said Monday.
   Souter moved to Weare, N.H., from the Boston suburb of Melrose
at age 11. He has never married and still lives alone on the family
farm where he grew up.
   ``He has a small circle of very good friends and lives an almost
monastic life,'' said Rudman, who first recommended Souter for the
high court when President Reagan was unable to get Robert Bork
confirmed in 1987.
   ``If he has any fault, I believe it's that he's worked too hard
all his life. But that's the way he is,'' Rudman said.
   Tom Rath, who replaced Souter as state attorney general and also
is a close friend, said Souter enjoys hiking and reading.
   His voracious appetite for books shows in his farmhouse, which,
he said once in an interview, ``looks as though someone is moving a
bookstore and has stopped.''
   Despite Souter's quiet, conservative appearance, he has ``a
wicked sense of humor that can skewer the most stuffed shirt,''
Rath says.
   Souter has left rural Weare only to attend Harvard College and
Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and Harvard Law School, from
which he was graduated in 1966.
   As a law student, Souter was a resident adviser in a freshman
dorm at the college, where his charges included Chase G.
Untermeyer, now White House personnel director.
   Souter could ``give the impression with the movement of an eye
and the slightest inclination of his head that he was catching
everything that goes on _ which is exactly the type of person you
want watching over a freshman dorm,'' Untermeyer said Monday.
   After graduating from law school, Souter went into private
practice for two years. Named an assistant state attorney general
in 1968, he became deputy and then attorney general in 1976.
   Arch-conservative Gov. Meldrim Thomson made him a Superior Court
judge in 1978, and then-Gov. John Sununu _ now White House chief of
staff _ elevated him to the state Supreme Court in 1983.
   In April, Souter won confirmation to the 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Boston, where he began work in June.
   If confirmed, Souter would be the Supreme Court's 105th justice.
He would be its sixth bachelor, the first New Englander since Felix
Frankfurter retired in 1962, and the second Rhodes scholar, joining
Justice Byron R. White.
   Though friends recall him driving rusting, aging cars, and
living a less than extravagant lifestyle, Souter had a net worth of
$621,000 at the end of 1989 _ including $191,000 in personal
property, $190,000 in securities and $150,000 in real estate _
according to financial records released Monday. He listed no
liabilities.
   Some immediately challenged the selection. Elliott Berry, a New
Hampshire Legal Assistance lawyer, voiced reservations about how
Souter would treat ``the disenfranchised.''
   ``His overall philosophy tends to result in support for the
status quo,'' Berry said.
   But he was praised by Ellen Musinsky, who teaches family law at
Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord and who appeared before
Souter often when he was a trial judge. Though she frequently
disagrees with Souter, she said she respects him.
   ``A lot of the male judges were not real pleasant to practice in
front of, but he was great,'' she said. ``He was nice. He respected
me. He made me feel like if I had done my work, which I did, I'd
get a very fair shot. He was delightful.''

   A Rotary Club chapter has made its own AIDS
documentary for distribution to 24,000 chapters worldwide that
chronicles the lives of three Rotarians affected by the deadly
disease.
   ``Our idea is to change the attitude in Wichita, Kansas,'' said
Dick Hasenpflug, chairman of the Rotary AIDS Project of the Los
Altos Rotary Club.
   Dushan Angius challenged the Rotary Club to get involved in AIDS
education last summer when he told the group his son, Steve, had
AIDS.
   ``When a son tells you he has AIDS, all you hear is `Gee Dad,
I'm going to die.' There's no way I could let it go that way,''
Angius said.
   The documentary, scheduled to be shown to the media today,
eventually will be distributed to 24,000 Rotary Clubs worldwide,
Hasenpflug said.
   ``Rotarians around the world tend to be leaders in their
communities and we think the Rotarian network gives a unique
opportunity to make an impact on community thinking,'' he said.
   The film initially was going to feature Steve Angius's story
alone. But as word of the project spread, two Rotary Club members
publicly acknowledged that they tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Greg Betts, president of the Bayshore Rotary Club in neighboring
Palo Alto, volunteered to appear in the film.
   Walter Singer, a 67-year-old retired businessman, went one step
further. He allowed crews to film the meeting in December when he
told the Los Altos Rotary Club how he contracted the AIDS virus in
a blood transfusion during heart bypass surgery.
   ``It was an individual reaction, sort of a gasp,'' Hasenpflug
said. ``It was dead silent, a lot of hugging and holding. All of
these things you don't expect a lot of 60-year-old men to be
doing.''
   Singer said the courage of the Angius family and the public
support they received persuaded him to go public.
   ``The Rotarians are not exempt, which they thought they were,''
Singer said.
   The local Rotary Club's involvement with AIDS is a departure for
the conservative organization that usually avoids politically
controversial subjects, Hasenpflug said.
   ``We believe strongly that the AIDS project transcends
politics,'' Hasenpflug said. ``The political part of it is how
people catch it, and in my opinion, how people catch it is
irrelevant once they catch it. People need our support.''
   Hasenpflug describes the film as ``a very powerful piece'' that
avoids presenting facts about the disease and instead focuses on
the impact AIDS has on individuals.
   On the first day of shooting, crews filmed Steve Angius asking
his family to take him to the hospital. He died the next day, Nov.
25.
   ``Grown men cry when they watch this thing,'' Hasenpflug said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. military experts arrived in
Cambodia today to examine what may be the remains of America's
wartime missing, the first such mission since the 1975 Communist
takeover.
   The six-man team, including two forensic scientists, flew from
Bangkok, Thailand, in a U.S. Air Force C-141 jet transport.
   The U.S. delegation shook hands awkwardly with a group of
mid-level Cambodian officials then drove into Phnom Penh, where
they spent an hour touring the city before meetings with Cambodian
officials.
   On Wednesday, they are to examine remains collected by the
Cambodians. If it appears the remains may be those of American
servicemen, they are to be removed to the United States for further
examination and identification.
   The United States still does not recognize the
Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government. On Wednesday, however,
it announced it was withdrawing recognition of the guerrilla
coalition battling the government in order to open talks with
Vietnam on ending the country's civil war.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said on July 13
that today's mission would be strictly humanitarian and have no
political intent. American officials have complained that the
Cambodians postponed repatriation of remains in order to exact
political concessions from the United States.
   The visiting team is from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center
and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii-based
agencies that try to account for U.S. military personnel listed as
missing in action in the Indochina conflict.
   It is led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey, head of the resolution center.
   Harvey said on arrival in Phnom Penh that he came only to view
the remains and the issue of normalized relations between Cambodia
and the United States ``definitely is not on the agenda.''
   In Bangkok, team spokesman Lt. Col. Thomas Boyd said that if the
remains are identified as those of Americans, a 17-member team will
fly to Phnom Penh Thursday for a military honors ceremony. The
remains would be flown to Hawaii.
   Boyd said he did not know how many sets of remains the team will
examine.
   A total of 2,299 Americans are officially listed as missing in
action in Indochina. Of those, 1,678 are missing in Vietnam, 533 in
Laos and six in China's coastal waters.
   Of the 82 missing in Cambodia, most are airmen whose planes were
downed during strikes on the Ho Chi Minh Trail in eastern areas
that North Vietnam used to infiltrate men and supplies into South
Vietnam.
   U.S. airplanes heavily bombed the country from 1969 until 1973.
   U.S. officials have said there also are at least eight civilians
missing in Cambodia, including four journalists, two contractors, a
merchant seaman and a missionary.
   The Khmer Rouge toppled the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government in
April 1975, sending the American ambassador fleeing. Over the next
four years, the Khmer Rouge killed hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians as it tried to turn the country into an agrarian commune.
   The Vietnamese invasion of late 1978 ousted the Khmer Rouge and
installed a new communist government in Phnom Penh. The Khmer Rouge
then joined two non-communist groups in a guerrilla coalition
backed by China and many other countries.
   Earlier this month, John Gunther Dean, the last U.S. Ambassador
to Cambodia, made a six-day visit to Phnom Penh _ his first since
carrying out the U.S. flag during the 1975 evacuation.
   Phnom Penh said in 1984 that it was willing to cooperate on the
issue of missing Americans and declared in 1988 it was willing to
hand over remains. But the repatriations had been delayed by the
diplomatic stalemate.
   Prime Minister Hun Sen was quoted as saying in February 1989
that his government had eight sets of American remains and was
searching for more.
   Last month, the Cambodian government said it had set up a
five-man commission chaired by a deputy minister to help search for
the remains of U.S. servicemen.

<HEAD>Soldier Charged in Panama Invasion Worried About Getting Fair
Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A soldier the Army charged with murder
in the slaying of a man in civilian clothes during the U.S.
invasion of Panama says he is worried that politics will prevent
him from getting a fair trial.
   ``If I'm found innocent the Department of Army will look bad,''
said 1st Sgt. Roberto E. Bryan, an 82nd Airborne Division
paratrooper and 19-year Army veteran.
   Bryan is charged with unpremeditated murder and faces a maximum
life prison sentence if convicted. He says he was merely performing
his duty in the heat of battle and that he has enough evidence to
be acquitted.
   ``Where I'm concerned is the political issue. I have to keep my
eyes open so they don't use command influence in the trial,'' he
said.
   An Army spokeswoman said Bryan's fears were unfounded.
   ``As far as getting a fair trial, that's the purpose of a trial
by court-martial,'' Staff Sgt. Cindy Darst, a spokeswoman for the
18th Airborne Corps, the umbrella command of the 82nd Airborne,
said Monday.
   The Army alleges Bryan shot a Panamanian man without provocation
on Dec. 23, 1989 _ three days after the United States began the
invasion that toppled dictator Manuel Noriega from power.
   The shooting occurred during a barrage of gunfire that erupted
when a Panamanian tossed a hand grenade that wounded 10 soldiers at
a roadblock.
   Bryan's battalion and brigade commanders recommended dismissal
of the murder charge. An officer who conducted an Article 32
investigation, similar those conducted by civilian grand juries,
reduced the original premeditated murder charge to voluntary
manslaughter.
   That charge was upgraded to unpremeditated murder _ the military
equivalent of second-degree murder _ by Lt. Gen. Gary E. Luck, 18th
Airborne commander. ``I was basically convicted before'' the
Article 32 investigation, said Bryan, referring to a March report
in the Army Times newspaper that quoted unnamed Army sources as
saying Bryan killed a wounded Panamanian prisoner attempting to
surrender.
   ``Publicity is the reason it has gone this far,'' said Mark L.
Waple, Bryan's attorney. The Army does not want to face ``criticism
from the media or Congress.''
   Bryan and other soldiers at the roadblock said the wounded man
did not attempt to surrender and prompted gunfire at him by moving
suddenly, like he was reaching for a weapon. Bryan said the body
was not searched and it is not known if the man was armed. No
autopsy was performed, Army officials said.
   Five Panamanians, wearing civilian clothes, were ordered out of
a vehicle so it could be searched.
   Members of Noriega's Panamanian Defense Force and his Dignity
Battalions were known to wear civilian clothes.
   A search of the vehicle produced a tear gas grenade, a machete
and an unfired rifle cartridge. The Panamanians were ordered to lie
on the ground and soon afterward a hand grenade exploded.
   Witnesses said many soldiers fired at the Panamanians.
   Bryan said he was about 70 yards from the roadblock when he
heard the grenade explode.
   He said he ran to the highway and told the men to cease firing.
Four of the five Panamanians were killed, Bryan said.
   ``It was chaos,'' he said. ``I saw the man make an arm movement,
like he was reaching for something. But how do they know the
bullets I fired killed him? When I opened up everybody else opened
fire in that direction again.''
   At least three other U.S. soldiers have been prosecuted for
their actions during the Panama invasion.
   One was convicted of unpremeditated murder and two others were
found guilty of lesser charges after a firefight investigators said
was staged to cover up a soldier's loss of his handgun at a bar.

<HEAD>Fast-Food French Fry Lovers in for Healthy Oil Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a little prodding from a well-heeled health
crusader, the nation's top four hamburger chains agree: french fry
lovers need an oil change.
   McDonald's Corp. and Wendy's International announced Monday they
are switching to cholesterol-free, all-vegetable oil to cook their
fries.
   Hardee's made the change two years ago and Burger King said last
week it will no longer use beef tallow, the industry's previous
standard oil for french fry vats.
   ``Everything that's deep fried is now done in 100 percent
cholesterol-free oil,'' said McDonald's spokesman Chuck Rubner. The
company started cooking its chicken items, pies and fish in
vegetable oil four years ago, he said.
   McDonald's has been a target of newspaper and TV ads placed by
anti-cholesterol crusader Phil Sokolof, who accused the world's
largest restaurant chain of poisoning Americans with fatty foods.
   Sokolof said a recent Advertising Age-Gallup Organization poll
indicated a significant number of people responded to his ads by
shying away from fast-food outlets.
   ``Consumers have the power to move mountains, and that's what
they did,'' he said in a telephone interview after the McDonald's
announcement. ``We obviously speeded up the process.''
   ``That's really ridiculous,'' countered McDonald's spokeswoman
Terri Capatosto. ``We've been in the nutrition business a lot
longer than Mr. Sokolof has been in the ad business.''
   Rubner said McDonald's has been experimenting with using
vegetable oil for eight years and that test marketing in 500
restaurants began in October.
   ``Clearly, the challenge that we were looking at was to maintain
the same taste _ the worldwide favorite _ while at the same time
improving the nutritional value,'' said Rubner.
   Sokolof, a 66-year-old millionaire from Omaha, Neb., blames a
high-cholesterol diet for a near-fatal heart attack 22 years ago.
   In April, Sokolof placed ads headlined ``The Poisoning of
America!'' in several major U.S. newspapers. The ads criticized
McDonald's and other restaurants for cooking foods in beef tallow
rather than using ``heart-healthy oils.''
   McDonald's warned newspapers against printing Sokolof's ads,
contending they were inaccurate.
   On July 3, Sokolof placed ads aimed specifically at McDonald's.
   McDonald's new french fry oil, expected to be in use nationwide
by the end of the year, is a combination of corn and cottonseed oil.
   The company said the new cooking oil will be cholesterol-free
and result in a 45 percent reduction in saturated fat content. For
a regular-size order of fries, Rubner said, saturated fat will go
from 5.05 grams to 2.7 grams.
   Wendy's vice president Charlie Rath said the company's change
drops the cholesterol in a 3.2-ounce french fry serving from 15
milligrams to a trace and reduces saturated fat by 20 percent, from
15 grams to 12 grams.
   Vegetable oils don't contain cholesterol, but certain kinds of
vegetable oils contain saturated fats, which the body converts to
cholesterol. Thus, eating ``cholesterol-free'' food doesn't
necessarily protect a person from cholesterol.
   Doctors advocate food cooked in polyunsaturated fat or
monounsaturated fat, found in corn, sunflower and other oils.
Vegetable oils to avoid are palm and coconut.
   Rubner said McDonald's has a market share that exceeds that of
Hardee's, Burger King and Wendy's combined. Sales by McDonald's
franchisees and company-owned stores totaled $4.6 billion for the
second quarter of this year.
   Two other fast-food rivals, Arby's and Kentucky Fried Chicken,
already fry their food in vegetable oils.

<HEAD>Exxon Valdez Skipper Faces Fight to Keep License</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four months after his Alaska acquittal
on most charges in the Exxon Valdez disaster, Joseph Hazelwood is
fighting a new legal battle to save his seagoing career.
   A Coast Guard hearing on whether Hazelwood should keep his
master's license is set to begin Wednesday.
   Administrative Judge Harry J. Gardner could choose to dismiss
all charges against the skipper, revoke his license or place him on
probation.
   Hazelwood and his lawyers will present evidence intended to show
that he is innocent of negligence and misconduct in the nation's
worst oil spill, his lawyers say.
   ``Capt. Hazelwood looks forward to putting on his case and being
vindicated much as he has been in Alaska,'' said one of his
lawyers, Michael Chalos. ``He's been spending most of his time
helping us prepare for this hearing.''
   Chalos and Thomas Russo, lawyers for Hazelwood in his Anchorage
trial earlier this year, will call at least five expert witnesses
who testified for him in that proceeding, including two fellow
tanker captains.
   The hearing is scheduled for Long Beach because it is the
headquarters for the 11th Coast Guard District, which includes
Alaska.
   The 987-foot Valdez tanker struck a charted reef and spilled 11
million gallons of Alaska crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   The spill killed fish, birds and wildlife and blackened the
shore for hundreds of miles. The disaster became a rallying point
for environmentalists and led to criminal charges against Hazelwood.
   After a two-month trial, Hazelwood was acquitted of being drunk
and reckless and was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of
negligent discharge of oil. The conviction is under appeal, along
with his sentence of $50,000 in restitution and 1,000 hours
cleaning beaches at Prince William Sound.

<HEAD>Greece Ratifies New US Bases Treaty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NIKOS KONSTANDARAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the narrowest of margins, Parliament
today ratified a defense treaty with the United States that will
allow two American bases to remain on Crete for at least eight more
years.
   The treaty, which guarantees U.S. help if Greece is attacked,
has been a divisive issue in Greek politics and hundreds of
anti-base demonstrators clashed with police on Monday near the city
of Khania on Crete. Three policemen were reported slightly injured
after being shot by demonstrators.
   The parliamentary approval early today ended more than 18 months
of uncertainty about the future of the bases.
   The previous defense treaty expired in December 1988 but was
extended as negotiations continued through several changes of
government in Greece.
   A simple majority of the 300-member Parliament was required for
ratification, which came after three days of debate.
   Conservative politicians support a continued U.S. military
presence, but leftists demand the removal of the bases.
   The pact takes effect in September and runs through 1998.
   A State Department official, requesting anonymity, said late
Monday that the United States considers the pact an executive
agreement, which would not require ratification by Congress.
   The treaty allows the United States to continue operating two
major military bases on the island of Crete _ a naval support
facility at Souda Bay and Iraklion Air Station near the village of
Gournes.
   Two bases near Athens _ a Navy communications station at Nea
Makri and the Hellenikon Air Base _ have been slated for closing by
the Defense Department as a cost-cutting measure.
   Numerous relay stations throughout Greece also will close.
   The treaty continues a defense relationship between the NATO
allies that began in 1953.
   The U.S. administration has also agreed to seek congressional
approval for an aid package that would provide Greece with about
$345 million in assistance to buy U.S. military equipment, supply
surplus planes and destroyers worth about $1 billion, and write off
about $50 million in past debts for military purchases.
   All 151 deputies from the governing conservative New Democratic
Party voted in favor of the treaty. It was opposed by 144
Communist, Socialist and environmentalist deputies. Four deputies
were absent and one abstained.
   Uunder the socialist government of Premier Andreas Papandreou,
17 rounds of talks on a new bases treaty proved fruitless.
   The talks were put on hold last year when coalition governments
held power. On April 8, the conservative government was elected.
The United States reached agreement in principle on May 30 after
two rounds of talks.
   On Crete, a coalition of leftist groups opposed to the U.S.
bases staged demonstrations in Khania on Monday night. As many as
2,500 people took part in the protests, according to witnesses and
journalists.
   Police fired tear gas to prevent demonstrators from entering a
municipal building to deliver a petition, the Public Order Ministry
said.
   Clashes then broke out, and three police officers suffered
gunshot wounds, the ministry said. Another five officers were
injured by gasoline bombs and stones hurled by demonstrators, it
said.
   A hospital source said 10 civilians were treated for respiratory
problems caused by the tear bas, and another 40 people received
treatment for minor injuries. A police official in Khania said
eight people were arrested during the disturbances.

   The dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo Tuesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
shed moderately.
   The dollar stood at 148.70 yen, up 0.20 yen from Monday's close
of 148.15 yen. After opening at 148.15 yen, the currency ranged
between 148.05 yen and 148.75 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell 192.33
points, or 0.60 percent, closing at 31,702.46. The index had lost
526.72 points on Monday.
   In bond dealings, the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 85.86 points as of 3 p.m., up from Monday's
close of 85.77. The yield was 7.445 percent, down from 7.465
percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained weak during morning
trading, but the currency advanced in the afternoon session.
   Daiwa Securities trader Naoki Ohno said many of his counterparts
had expected the market to fall lower after Monday's stock market
decline in New York, but Tokyo remained calm.
   Ohno said that a slip in Tokyo bond prices combined with a
report in the respected financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun
that long term credit banks were planning to raise their prime
rates served to calm Tokyo stock traders.
   ``The index began taking a recovery step toward the end of
morning session,'' said a Nomura Securities dealer who spoke
anonymously.

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party candidates fighting
to extend 70 years of rule defeated most of the opposition slate in
the initial round of Mongolia's first multiparty elections, the
government said today.
   Preliminary results from Sunday's primary indicated that just 96
of 300 candidates from the five opposition parties survived, Prime
Minister Sharavyn Gunjaadorg said.
   The balloting was to reduce the field of 2,400 candidates to
860, two for each seat in the national legislature, or Great
People's Hural. The final round of voting is Sunday.
   Gunjaadorg maintained that a Communist victory would not hinder
Mongolia's dramatic transformation, which began in December, from
an authoritarian, one-party state obedient to Moscow to a
multiparty nation eager for Western contact and investment.
   He said the non-Communist parties would still have ``some
possibility ... to get into power.''
   The opposition's only hope for gaining a significant voice in
government lies in the 53-seat Small Hural, which will handle
legislation between annual sessions of the Great Hural.
   Its seats will be assigned to the various parties according to
the percentage of the vote each receives.
   Even a Communist-controlled Great Hural would be very different
from its predecessor, however, because most of the party's
candidates this time are intellectuals and bureacrats, rather than
herders and workers as in the past.
   The election process so far ``is a comparatively free and fair
one,'' Gunjaadorg told a news conference.
   ``Of course since we are exercising this kind of election for
the first time there are some shortcomings and some bumps,'' he
said.
   Nineteen foreign observers are in town, from the Soviet Union,
United States, Poland and Britain. A source in the capital, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, visited 10 polling stations in the
city and described the voting as ``very well organized.''
   Mongolia is especially eager that the election be perceived as
fair because Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to
visit next week and discuss extending most-favored nation trade
status to Mongolia.
   Mongolia's ambassador to the United States, Nyamdoo, said the
State Department did not confirm Baker's trip until the opposition
parties dropped a threat to boycott the election.
   Opposition nominees had been far outnumbered at the start, with
the Communists fielding nearly 2,100 candidates. The opposition
acknowledged early on that it had no hope of controlling the Great
Hural.
   Formed only over the past few months, the five non-Communist
parties claim a combined membership of about 12,000, to the ruling
party's 98,000. They have only a fraction of its financial assets
and no daily media outlet.
   Although they appear to have substantial support in cities,
where half of Mongolia's 2 million people live, the oppositionists
have had to scramble to spread word of their programs to the rural
people.
   Many of those people are semi-nomadic herders only dimly aware
of the large demonstrations in Ulan Bator that began in December
and forced the Communists to agree to elections. They know even
less of the anti-Communist revolutions in Eastern Europe that
inspired Mongolia's opposition.
   In the Great Hural, one seat has been allocated for every 2,000
rural residents and every 10,000 urban residents, hurting the
city-based opposition.
   In recent months, the Communists have embraced many of the goals
of the opposition, including its demand for market-style economic
reforms, decreased reliance on the Soviet Union and a revival of
traditional culture.
   Gunjaadorg said the government is drafting legislation to define
the role of private and cooperative ownership in the economy, in
which now almost all enterprises are state-owned.
   However, he indicated private ownership would be restricted to
agriculture, the service sector and small-scale industries.
   Other parties, including the National Progressive Party, have
called for bolder privatization.
   The largest opposition party, the Mongolian Democratic Party,
says the Communists are incapable of reform and seek only to stay
in power.
   Mongolia has been ruled by the Communists since 1921, when a
small band of revolutionaries aided by Soviet troops drove out the
Chinese, who had controlled Mongolia since 1691.
   China retained southern Mongolia, called Inner Mongolia, where
Mongolian tribal princes had formed alliances with the Chinese.

   The condemned ``man'' had a metal strainer
for a head, a vat of salty water for a body and piece of pipe for a
leg. Engineers testing the state's electric chair said he died
quickly.
   But attorneys trying to win reprieves for Florida death row
inmates after flames jumped from electrodes strapped to a
prisoner's head in a recent execution say they were unimpressed
with the unusual test Monday.
   A series of tests were ordered by Gov. Bob Martinez after the
botched May 4 electrocution of Jesse Tafero.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has blocked several
scheduled executions because of questions raised by defense
attorneys about the effectiveness of the chair.
   The makeshift ``inmate'' was jolted with current during the
15-minute demonstration, which caused a noisy buzzing. The test
showed the chair was putting out 2,000 volts and 10 to 11 amps.
   ``The electric chair works as it is supposed to,'' said Mike
Morse, an associate professor of electrical engineering at Auburn
University. ``We see no indication of smoke, arcing or burning.''
   The test carried out in the death chamber at Florida State
Prison was viewed by news reporters, state officials,
representatives of the General Electric Co. and officials from
Virginia and South Carolina.
   Martinez said he is ``satisfied that this objective test by
independent experts conclusively shows what we have been saying all
along _ that Florida's electric chair is in working order. The
source of problems during this state's last execution was
accurately identified and has been corrected.
   ``It is my sincere hope that defense attorneys will cease using
this false argument as a basis for unsubstantiated appeals,''
Martinez said.
   But Jay Nickerson, with the Office of Capital Collateral
Representative, a state-funded agency that represents poor death
row inmates, was unimpressed by the test.
   ``It proves it works real good on a colander. It works real good
when you take a sponge and put it in a toaster. But I certainly
don't want it used on my client,'' he said, adding that his group
was denied permission to bring in its own experts.
   Morse said almost 50 tests of the chair had been conducted over
the weekend. He said he is convinced that it was a synthetic sponge
that caused sparks and flames to shoot from Tafero's head.
   Tests using a synthetic sponge under the head electrode produced
similiar results with flames and sparks spewing out.
   Corrections Secretary Richard Dugger immediately notified the
governor's office of the test results, but said he didn't know when
they would be forwarded to the appeals court.
   The execution of Anthony Bertolotti, which had been scheduled
for 7 a.m. today, was stayed by the Florida Supreme Court until 7
a.m. Thursday. But attorneys have predicted that it is unlikely any
executions will take place until the faulty-chair issue is settled
in court.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National health insurance is needed to avert a
financial collapse of the health-care system, say some physicians
and hospital officials. The Bush administration is unconvinced.
   ``Abandonment of the uninsured is becoming a societal disgrace
and a financial disaster for many hospitals,'' said Edward Thomas,
president of Detroit Receiving Hospital and chairman of the
Michigan Hospital Association.
   Michigan hospitals lost $350 million last year treating patients
who could not, or would not, pay, Thomas told a Senate subcommittee
monday.
   Nearly 25 percent of the people treated at his inner-city
hospital are not covered by insurance, he said.
   ``There is mounting evidence that the system is on the verge of
fiscal collapse,'' said Norton J. Greenberger, chairman of the
Department of Medicine at the University of Kansas Medical Center.
   As many as 37 million Americans have no health insurance,
Greenberger told the Senate Finance subcommittee on health for
families and the uninsured. Nearly as many have inadequate or
interrupted overage, he said.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., the subcommittee chairman, said the
situation ``underscores the need to develop a national strategy for
providing health care for all Americans. It ought to be clear to us
that the system is breaking down.''
   However, Health and Human Services Secretary louis Sullivan told
business leaders in Atlanta on Monday that the solution will be
found in a free market where businesses are not burdened with
requirements.
   ``Those who call for a radical revamping of our health-care
system -- suggesting nationalized medicine -- are mistaken,''
Sullivan said in his prepared remarks, which were made available in
Washington.

<HEAD>Workers Cited Safety Problems To Relatives</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two of the 17 workers killed by an explosion
at a Texas chemical plant had told relatives they were worried
about the plant's safety, according to family members.
   The workers also had worries about training at Atlantic
Richfield Co.'s plant in Channelview, where vapors caught fire and
exploded near an electric compressor July 5, witnesses told a House
panel on Monday.
   ``Safety has to come before profit,'' said Sandy Davis, widow of
Greg Davis, an electrician killed in the blast. Ms. Davis wept
while testifying that her husband told her several times he was
unsure of the skills of some of his fellow contractors.
   The chief of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
Gerald Scannell, said the agency has proposed new safety rules for
the chemical industry. But the rules aren't being put into place
fast enough, said two Houston congressmen, Democrat Mike Andrews
and Republican Jack Fields.
   ``There's not a chance in hell I'd work for a chemical plant
unless I had a 1-year-old child and was out of work,'' aid Rep.
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., referring to Davis, whose widow said he
took the Arco job in suburban Houston after being unemployed for
six months and becoming a new father.
   But Fields cautioned, ``It is doubtful that the government, or
any particular company, can ever completely guarantee that
something isn't going to go wrong.''
   The congressmen said they were frustrated that 40 workers had
been killed at chemical companies in the nine months since the
House employment and housing subcommittee examined the October
explosion that killed 23 at a Phillips plastics plant in Pasadena,
another Houston suburb.

<HEAD>Some States Still Allow Public Schools To Teach About Religion</HEAD>

   Public schools in 13 states are permitted to
teach about religion, and the Bible may be taught as literature in
10 states, a new survey finds.
   It also shows that 23 states allow excused absences for
religious holidays and 22 mention observance of a moment of silence
in their laws or regulations.
   The survey was conducted by the National Council on Religion and
Public Education, which says its purpose is to provide a forum for
issues involving religions and public education.
   The survey, which drew responses from all states except Hawaii,
was to determine how many laws, regulations or guidelines were on
the books of states in matters of religion or moral education. A
law or regulation was counted whether it permitted or forbade a
practice.
   Teaching about religion in public schools is different from
teaching religion, said Charles C. Haynes of Americans United
Research Foundation. ``We advocate public discussion about religion
in public schools,'' he said Monday.
   The survey was by Charles R. Kniker, assistant dean of education
at Iowa State University.

<HEAD>Expert Says Combination of Factors can `Tip the Balance' to
Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SANDRA CHEREB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A psychiatrist testifying in behalf of the
rock band Judas Priest said two men who allegedly shot themselves
because of subliminal messages by the group had a number of risk
factors that could lead to suicide.
   Donald Lunde, who teaches at Stanford University, testified
Monday the two men exhibited personality disorders and suffered
from drug and alcohol abuse, dysfunctional family lives and
emotional problems.
   A combination of these factors can ``tip the balance'' toward
suicide, Lunde said.
   ``Each of these young men were supportive of the notion of
suicide,'' he said. ``The more of these things you have, the
greater predisposition you have toward suicide.''
   Lunde said his review of extensive medical histories and files
on both fans of the heavy metal group convinced him the two
exhibited a combination of risk factors that could potentially lead
to suicide.
   The families of Raymond Belknap, 18, and James Vance, then 20,
filed suit against the band and CBS Records, claiming subliminal
messages on Judas Priest's 1978 ``Stained Class'' album drove the
young men to a suicide pact.
   Belknap died from a single blast from a shotgun held to his chin
on Dec. 23, 1985. Vance blew away the lower half of his face but
survived the shooting. He lived three more years and fathered a
child before dying of complications from his injuries and a
reaction to medications.
   The defense denies subliminal messages exist on the album, and
counters that the young men's troubled lives, including family
violence, drug and alcohol abuse, poor academics and brushes with
the law, determined their fates, not some subconscious command.
   Lunde, who has testified as an expert witness in such
high-profile cases as the Jonestown Massacre, Hillside Strangler
and Patty Hearst trials, said the brain cannot decipher messages
recorded backward and cannot perceive words masked by music or
other sound.
   ``You either hear it or you don't. We don't have more than one
mind up there. It either hears it, it perceives it and it registers
it or it doesn't,'' he said. ``Suicide is not a decision that can
be made by the subconscious mind.''
   Vivian Lynch, representing Vance's family, disparaged Lunde's
testimony.
   ``I don't think it's relevant,'' she said. ``He's not
knowledgeable in the field of subliminal messages.''
   The plaintiffs have not finished presenting their case, but
Lunde was allowed to testify for the defense Monday because it was
uncertain he would be available when the band and CBS Records begin
to present their cases.

<DATELINE>HAVANA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some areas of Cuba, oxen are replacing
gas-guzzling tractors. In Havana, office workers are being asked
now and then to do without air-conditioning. Fuel at most state
enterprises has been cut back 10 percent.
   And this could be only the beginning.
   Cubans are bracing for tough times, the result in part of last
year's democratic upheaval in Eastern Europe and the prospect that
Cuba may no longer be able to count on Soviet generosity to
buttress its economy.
   For years, Cuba has suffered from a U.S. trade and financial
embargo.
   But now, all over the island, Cubans are being warned at town
meetings that additional belt tightening may be around the corner
if bargain-rate Soviet oil supplies, averaging about 90 million
barrels annually, are cut off and there is no money to tap
alternate sources.
   Soviet deliveries already have slowed, and President Fidel
Castro alluded to the problem in a speech last month:
   ``Stubborn realities are there. We constantly have to think in
terms of less and less fuel. We have to tell the truth.''
   An added concern is that Soviet officials have spoken publicly
about the possibility of a phased reduction of overall Soviet
economic assistance to Cuba, a windfall estimated by some at $4
billion to $5 billion a year.
   U.S. sources have said there has been a marked decline in
purchases of Cuban sugar by the Soviet Union at prices
substantially higher than world market levels, a form of subsidy
for the Cuban economy.
   President Bush has been appealing to the Soviets to cut Castro
off. The United States has expressed reluctance to provide direct
aid to the troubled Soviet economy as long as Moscow sends billions
of rubles to Cuba.
   ``Special period in peacetime'' is the somewhat benign sounding
name for the draconian measures Castro has in mind in the event
Cuba has to go it alone.
   To show that he means business, dress rehearsals are being held
around the island to give Cubans a taste of what may lie ahead.
   Oxen are being tried out on farms in western Cuba.
   Military recruits are being asked to extend their tours of duty
by two months to help the armed services become self-sufficient in
food.
   Under the most extreme austerity measures, thousands could be
thrown out of work in Havana, partly because a suspension of most
bus service would make it impossible for many to commute.
   Already, some offices are experimenting with allowing employees
to try working at home to see whether their labors would still be
useful.
   Under the worst case scenario, Castro has said that all housing
construction would be halted immediately and the manufacture of
adult clothing would be suspended.
   Not all enterprises would be affected. Cuba's ambitious tourism
program, slated to bring an almost five-fold increase in the number
of foreign visitors to 1.5 million by 1995, would be spared.
   Castro is discovering somewhat belatedly what his non-Communist
predecessors here knew all along: As earners of foreign exchange,
Cuba's biggest assets are its tropical climate and its miles of
sandy beaches.
   Some Cuban officials believe that a shift in trading partners
from the former socialist bloc to Western industrialized nations
will brighten Cuba's economic prospects over the long run.
   Castro has complained bitterly about the low quality products
sent by Eastern European countries to Cuba in exchange for prized
Cuban exports such as sugar, citrus fruit and nickel.
   Cuba may now be able to use these exports to buy high quality
goods from the capitalist West, the officials said. But reshaping
foreign trade relationships takes time and for now, the future is
extraordinarily bleak.
   Some Cubans have lost hope.
   More than two dozen presumed asylum seekers are holed up at
three European embassies these days. They decided to abandon the
revolution even though Castro has said none of them will be given
permission to leave the country.
   According to the U.S. Coast Guard, the number of Cubans who fled

   But Castro seems determined to maintain his orthodox brand of
Marxism even at the cost of the most far-reaching austerity
measures. He has criticized Gorbachev's reforms and condemned the
changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``If in five years we don't build housing, if that's the price
for saving the revolution, then we will spend five years without
building them,'' he says.

<TEXT>
   Five months after it was suspended because of an
explosion, Europe's Ariane program is back in business with today's
launch of a rocket carrying a double payload of French and German
television satellites.
   The 37th Ariane rocket was to blast off tonight from the Ariane
facility in French Guiana, South America with a 49-minute ``launch
window'' beginning at 6:25 p.m. EST.
   It is the first attempt at an Ariane launch since a similar
rocket carrying two Japanese communications satellites blew up less
than two minutes after takeoff on Feb. 22. Both satellites were
destroyed.
   Investigators said the explosion was caused by a tiny piece of
cloth that clogged a line carrying water coolant to one of the
engines.
   The respected French weekly L'Express reported in a cover story
that the explosion, and at least two previous Ariane failures, may
have been caused by sabotage.
   Officials of Arianespace, the commercial branch of the European
Space Agency, have said there was no evidence to indicate sabotage
but that technical and security checks would be intensified.
   The Ariane project has been dogged by embarrassing and costly
setbacks, including rockets that have exploded or crashed, and
expensive delays.
   But Ariane rockets dominate the private aerospace industry,
carrying about half of the world's commercial payloads into space.
Excluding today's flight, Arianespace has contracts worth $2.8
billion to launch 37 more satellites.
   Ariane rockets have sent into space 45 commercial satellites
from Canada, France, West Germany, Great Britain, India, Italy,
Spain and the United States, as well as international organizations
such as Intelsat and Eutelsat.
   Ariane is facing increased competition, however, from American
private-sector rockets including the Titan-4 made by Martin
Marietta Corp., General Dynamics' Atlas-Centaur and the Delta built
by McDonnell Douglas.
   Until now U.S. rockets have mainly launched military and
scientific satellites under the supervision of the U.S. Air Force
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   China also is a contender in commercial launches with its Long
March rocket, as well as the Soviet Union with its Proton and Japan
with the H-2 rocket now under development.
   Flight 37 was to put two satellites into geostationary orbit _
TDF 2, a five-channel French television satellite, and the
11-channel DFS Kopernikus 2, for West Germany's Deutsche Bundespost
Telekom.
   The French satellite weighs 4,621 pounds and will join a twin
already in orbit to form a powerful relay system that can serve 400
million television viewers, according to Arianespace. The
Kopernikus weighs 3,126 pounds.
   The two satellites are being lifted into space by an Ariane 4
rocket, the most recent version introduced in 1988, two years
behind schedule. It features four strap-on boosters powered by
liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, and stands 190 feet high on the
launch pad.
   Different configurations of the strap-on boosters, using liquid
or solid fuel, can be used according to the needs of individual
clients.
   A newer version of the rocket, the heavy-lift launcher Ariane 5,
is being developed for planned introduction in 1995.
   Arianespace is a consortium made up of aerospace, electronics
and banking companies from 11 western European countries _ Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain,
Switzerland, Sweden and West Germany.

   He may not be the first president who
hankers for a ringer, but organizers of the 1990 World Horseshoe
Tournament credit George Bush with boosting the popularity of the
ancient pastime.
   ``His playing has boosted us tremendously,'' said Bob Champion,
a spokesman for the National Horseshoe Pitchers Association. ``It's
similar to golf, when (Dwight) Eisenhower was into it. And John F.
Kennedy? Wasn't he into football?''
   Bush is a member of the 16,000-member pitchers group and is
invited to all the tournaments, conventions and meetings, Champion
said.
   ``But, as you know, he is busy,'' he said. ``One day, I think
he'll surprise us out here and all hell will break loose.''
   More than 1,000 horseshoe contestants are in this Atlanta suburb
for the annual, two-week tournament, which opened Monday at Stone
Mountain Park. They came from across the United States and Canada,
from as far away as Australia, either for the sheer thrill of
victory or for a piece of the $95,000 in prizes.
   ``Most people think that horseshoes is something that farmers do
out behind the barn, or maybe in the backyard,'' competitor Noel
Guy said.
   ``Very few people know how very well organized the sport is ...
because we don't get much exposure,'' said Guy, a retired
electronics technician from San Jose, Calif. ``We don't make it on
TV like bowling or golf.''
   Bush's attachment to the sport ``did a big shot in the arm'' for
horseshoe pitching, but he's not the first man to practice the game
at the White House, Guy said.
   ``Harry Truman pitched horseshoes,'' he said. ``I didn't know
that either, until just about a year ago. Horseshoes was not that
far developed at that time. Now, President Bush is getting all the
attention.''
   Horseshoe pitching originated with soldiers in ancient Greece
who used discarded horseshoes for sport, imitating discus throwing
at the Olympian Games. More than 30 million people now pitch
horseshoes in tournaments or in city parks and backyards, the
organization says.
   A ringer, when the points of a horseshoe encircle a steel stake
in a clay or sand pit, counts as 3 points. One point is awarded
when a horseshoe lands within 6 inches of the stake.
   Two people compete in a game by throwing two horseshoes to the
opposite end of the court. They tally points before repeating
throws to the opposite pit. The first to get 40 points is the
winner.

<TEXT>
   Earthquake search teams reported
finding more bodies today in remote mountain communities devastated
by last week's temblor, and the death toll surpassed 1,600.
   A quake measuring 6 on the Richter scale struck the central
island of Negros early today but there were no reports of damage or
casualties.
   On Luzon island, President Corazon Aquino inspected damage in
her home province, Tarlac, where numerous churches, schools and
highways were damaged by the July 16 quake, which measured 7.7.
   On Monday, she asked Congress to approve $500 million to rebuild
damaged areas. Many congressmen also want to stop paying the $26
billion national debt to free funds for reconstruction.
   Figures from the Office of Civil Defense and the Red Cross
showed at least 1,621 people were killed in the quake. More than
3,000 were seriously injured and about 1,000 were listed as missing.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos, chairman of the National Disaster
Coordinating Council, said nearly 90,000 people had been left
homeless.
   Rescuers continued digging through the rubble of buildings in
the resort of Baguio, where more than 370 people died, and in
remote areas of mountainous northern Luzon island.
   In Baguio, 130 miles north of Manila, three bodies were
recovered from the wreckage of the Hyatt Hotel. The luxury hotel
collapsed during the quake.
   Aftershocks continued in the quake-ravaged north.
   Seismologists said the tremor on Negros was actually an
aftershock of a June 14 quake that killed seven people on the
central island of Panay.
   The Philippines sits astride 10 major faults or tremor tracks
and is among the most earthquake-prone countries on earth.
   Mrs. Aquino on Monday rejected proposals to divert foreign debt
payments to finance recovery, but supporters said they would press
ahead with their proposal.
   She also thanked foreign rescue and aid efforts.
   ``I should like to thank all of our friends throughout the world
_ governments, institutions as well as individuals _ for the
humanitarian assistance given to our people and the victims of the
earthquake,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   She did not mention an American serviceman, Marine Capt. Michael
Shannon of Ashland, Ore., who was killed Friday when his plane
crashed near Baguio on a rescue mission.
   Mrs. Aquino's spokesmen said the government was grateful for
American aid but that Filipinos did most of the work.
   She also did not cite cadets of the Philippine Military Academy
in Baguio, who were the first to launch rescue operations in the
mountain resort following the quake. Graduates of the academy have
been at the forefront of the six coup attempts against her
government.
   Mrs. Aquino said she would ask the National Disaster
Coordinating Council who to specifically thank later.

   Residents are gearing up for an annual
bathtub contest held to honor one of America's least known
presidents, along with an infamous hoax.
   Residents of this town 30 miles south of Syracuse hold Fillmore
Days to honor Millard Fillmore, a Cayuga County native who
journalist H.L. Mencken falsely reported in 1917 installed the
first bathtub in the White House.
   Mencken, who said he wanted to show how gullible the public was,
tried to retract his widely publicized column in 1926, but many
people continued to believe the bathtub story.
   This year, a decorated bathtub contest will replace tub races in
Moravia because of road construction downtown, said organizer Anne
Townsend. The races began in 1972.
   A trophy of a bathtub will be awarded to the winner of
Saturday's contest.
   About 2,000 spectators and at least 20 bathtubs are expected.
   Fillmore, the nation's 13th president from 1850 to 1853, was
born Jan. 7, 1800, about five miles west of Moravia.

   A self-proclaimed Satanist was sentenced
to an 80-year prison term in a plea bargain over attacks on elderly
women.
   Willie J. Hills, 28, flashed a victory sign Monday after he
pleaded no contest to sexual battery with force, attempted felony
murder, armed burglary and two counts of aggravated battery, amony
other charges.
   Hills was accused of beating two women in their 80s until they
were unconscious, raping and beating a third elderly woman and
fondling and tying up another.
   The attacks occurred last August and September at trailer parks
in Bradenton and Palmetto, less than a month after Hills was
released from a 3{-year sentence.
   Hills told police and psychologists that he believes in Satan
and that he committed the attacks ``to gain power.''
   According to testimony, Hills suffers from possible brain damage
and hallucinations. He has a history of violent crime and spent
eight years in prison on convictions for aggravated battery, armed
robbery, robbery and auto theft.

   The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen
today over news of increasing unrest in the Persian Gulf, prompting
traders to buy the currency regarded as a safe haven.
   The dollar closed at 148.70 yen, up 0.20 yen from Monday's close
of 148.15 yen. It opened at 148.15 yen, and ranged between 148.05
yen and 148.75 yen.
   Spot transactions totaled $8.833 billion, up from Monday's
$8.021 billion.
   Masaya Ueno, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said trading picked up
after a report in today's Washington Post that Iraq had moved
30,000 troops to its border with Kuwait and the United States
ordered its warships in Persian Gulf on alert.
   ``With the coming of the news shortly after noontime, the dollar
was bought as a safe haven in times of international tension,''
Ueno said.
   The Washington Post quoted unidentified western military
attaches as saying they had seen 2,000 to 3,000 Iraqi Army vehicles
moving south on a northbound trip they were allowed to take from
Kuwait to Baghdad, capital of Iraq.
   Kuwait backed Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran, but Iraq
is angry with Kuwait because, it claims, Kuwait's oil production
beyond quotas set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is depressing the price on world markets.
   On the stock market, Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
fell 192.33 points, or 0.60 percent, closing at 31,702.46. The
index had lost 526.72 points on Monday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 350 million shares,
up from the previous day's 300 million shares.
   ``The index lost some 390 points at one point in the afternoon
because of arbitrage selling, but made its recovery toward the
closing on index-related buying,'' said Tetsuya Abe, an analyst
with Nikko Securities.
   In arbitrage trading, investors seek to profit from the spread
between the spot and futures markets.
   Abe said the stock market as a whole remained weak over
uncertain prospects for interest rates in Japan.
   Japan's long-term credit banks are considering raising the
nation's long-term prime rate by as much as 0.3 percent to 7.9
percent a year, said an official of the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan. An official decision was to be made later this week, the
official said.
   The long-term rates, which lending institutions charge on loans
for more than one year, will set the pace for long-term interest
rates.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond stood at 85.84 points as of 5 p.m., up
from Monday's close of 85.77. The yield slipped to 7.450 percent,
down from 7.465 percent.

   ABC's ``China Beach'' will move not only to a
new time next season. It will travel to new decades, its producer
says.
   The Vietnam War series goes to Saturdays at 9 p.m. in the fall.
In the season pilot, it jumps forward to 1985, executive producer
John Sacret Young said Monday.
   The acclaimed drama that chronicles nurses and doctors attending
to war has been set in the 1960s since its debut two years ago. In
the fall, the series will follow the lives of main characters
through the 1970s and 1980s, Young said.
   ``The characters are going to have a wild ride,'' he said.
   The show, despite laudatory reviews and an Emmy award last year
for star Dana Delany, never was a ratings winner and faced an
uncertain fate until ABC renewed it for fall at the last minute.
   Bob Iger, the network's entertainment president, said he hopes
the show's new time slot, preceding ABC's cult hit ``Twin Peaks,''
helps to ensure its survival.
   Young and Delany, speaking to television critics Monday, said
they were surprised their series has lasted this long.
   ``China Beach'' premiered as a spring replacement series in 1988.
   ``I didn't think the pilot would get picked up,'' Delany said.
   Next season, Delany's character, the hard-drinking, emotionally
stifled nurse Colleen McMurphy, will be shown as an oft-married
woman in flash-forward sequences, Young said.
   Another major character will lose a leg, he said.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk will
continue talks with the African National Congress on ending white
rule despite claims that black nationalists are preparing to seize
power if negotiations fail.
   De Klerk says he will meet Aug. 6 with Nelson Mandela and other
top ANC leaders to try and clear the way for negotiations on
sharing political power with the black majority.
   But he has warned all political groups against trying to seize
power.
   He said after a meeting with senior government officials late
Monday that there was no room ``for any political organization to
stockpile arms in order to force its will at the negotiation table
or in any other way to prevent the political process taking its
normal course.''
   The ANC has confirmed that its guerrillas continue to infiltrate
South Africa, but denies police and media reports of an ANC plot to
seize power if political negotiations fail.
   Police have arrested dozens of ANC militants in connection with
the reported plot.
   De Klerk said he viewed the arrests in ``an extremely serious
light.''
   He rejected calls from the pro-apartheid main opposition
Conservative Party and other right-wing groups to call off talks
with the ANC. But he said the government was determined to maintain
law and order.
   ``It is imperative that good government be maintained at all
times. Therefore disorder, anarchy and terrorism will not be
tolerated,'' he said.
   The government and the ANC are trying to clear the way for
constitutional negotiations on sharing power with the black
majority. The ANC is demanding release of imprisoned militants and
other preliminary conditions.
   In other developments, the independent South African Press
Association said today that the death toll from black faction
fighting Sunday in Sebokeng outside Johannesburg had risen to 24.
   The area was reported quiet today, with police patrols roaming
the township to prevent further clashes between ANC militants and
supporters of Inkatha, a conservative Zulu group.
   The dead in the Sebokeng clashes included a white police officer
who was speared in the chest, officials said.
   Police said today that four blacks had been killed in violence
Monday near Kimberley in the Orange Free State, including a youth
who was shot when police opened fire after one of their vehicles
was attacked.
   Police also said today the bullet-riddled body of a police
officer was found overnight in the black homeland of
Bophuthatswana. Brian Ngqulunga had testified before a government
commission investigating charges that army and police agents killed
anti-apartheid activists.
   Police said they were investigating the death, but gave no
details.
   The United States Embassy in Pretoria announced today that an
ANC militant who sought refuge in the Durban consulate on Monday
had left of his own free will. Bhekumusa Jabulani Ximba went to the
consulte and asked for political asylum, U.S. officials said.
   The embassy did not say why Ximba had left the consulate.

   An electronic grid laid down by a Navy tug will
guide a high-tech probe in the Pacific Ocean search for a cargo
door that blew off a United Airlines jetliner, killing nine people.
   The National Transportation Safety Board completed its
investigation without the cargo door, but asked the Navy to find it
because the door could provide evidence to help improve aircraft
safety.
   The 226-foot tug Narragansett today was to lay down the last of
eight transponders, which transmit electrical signals to chart
movements of the video camera-equipped submersible, the centerpiece
of the Navy's Orion search system.
   The transponders will hang about 150 feet above the ocean floor
around the perimeter of the 24-square-mile search area some 100
miles southwest of Honolulu, said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson, spokesman
for the Pacific Fleet.
   The door is believed to be lying in about 15,000 feet of water.
   The submersible, called a ``towfish,'' is expected to be lowered
into the ocean on Wednesday, Anderson said.
   If the door is spotted, another device will be used to recover
it later.
   Once the tug reached the search area Monday ``they anticipated a
day and one-half setting up and getting ready. We expect they'll be
ready to put it in the water by Wednesday,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Sandy
Stairs, another Pacific Fleet spokesman.
   Flight 811 carried 355 passengers when it left Honolulu
International Airport for New Zealand on Feb. 24, 1989.
   Shortly after takeoff, a cargo door opened at 22,000 feet,
tearing away a section of fuselage and causing the Boeing 747 to
decompress. Nine people were swept to their deaths and five others
were seriously injured. The crew managed to return the jet to
Honolulu.
   The safety board decided faulty design of the door's locking
mechanism probably caused a cockpit panel light to falsely indicate
the door was locked.
   The federal agency blamed United, the Boeing Co. and the Federal
Aviation Administration for failure to correct problems with the
locking mechanism.

<HEAD>Common Interests, Children and Violence Linked to Increased Sex</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Couples who have violent relationships,
common interests or several children tend to have sex more often
than other couples, a sociologist says.
   Next to youth, shared interests were the greatest indicator of
sexual frequency in a marriage, said the University of Florida
researcher who based the study on a nationwide survey of 5,292
married couples.
   ``Whether it's something as simple as taking walks together or
enjoying the same hobbies, sharing activities outside the bedroom
is a big predictor of how often married couples have sex,''
sociologist Denise Donnelly said Monday.
   Ms. Donnelly said she found that partners in violent marriages
had sexual relations more often than other couples.
   ``People in these marriages may have intercourse more because of
a honeymoon period that follows each outbreak of violence,'' she
said. ``These couples may not only fight with a passion, but make
up with a passion as well.''
   Another explanation might be that people who are physically
expressive in showing their anger might be physically expressive in
other areas of their lives, including their sexual relationships,
she said.
   Ms. Donnelly also found that people who lived together before
marriage had more active sex lives than couples who didn't.
   ``Since these people are more individualistic and less prone to
follow society's expectations, they may also be less likely to have
`normal' levels of coital frequency,'' she said.
   Income, education, race and place of residence had no bearing on
how often a couple had sex, she said.
   But, contrary to other studies, she found that couples with more
children led the most active love lives.
   ``Other researchers have thought that the more children present,
the fewer the uninterrupted opportunities for intercourse,'' Ms.
Donnelly said. ``In reality, the more one has intercourse, the
greater the odds of conceiving a child, and the more children one
ultimately has.''
   Not surprisingly, she said, couples with school-aged children
said they had sex more often than did those with younger children.
   ``That is because preschoolers need more care and tend to
intrude more,'' she said. ``Your 13-year-old probably wouldn't pop
his head in the bedroom door and say, `What are you guys doing?,'
but your 5-year-old very well might.''

   A police tape made after a fatal shooting at
the mansion of actor Marlon Brandocannot be used in court against
his son, Christian, who faces a murder charge in the death of his
pregnant sister's lover.
   Municipal Court Judge Larry Fidler ruled Monday that detectives
failed to properly advise the younger Brando of his rights
following the May 16 shooting of Dag Drollet, 26.
   Prosecutors wanted to play a lengthy recording of Brando's
statements to detectives, but his lawyers objected.
   Detective Steve Osti said he informed Brando of his right to
remain silent, but neglected to say that if he could not afford a
lawyer, one would be appointed.
   Fidler ruled the omission was serious enough to invalidate the
tape as evidence.
   The dispute came at a pretrial hearing that will determine
whether there is sufficient evidence for Brando to stand trial for
murder and a weapons violation charge.
   The elder Brando, star of such films at ``On the Waterfront''
and the ``The Godfather'' sat solemnly in the courtroom's front
row, occasionally taking notes.
   His 32-year-old son appeared nervous as he was led into the
jammed courtroom. Outside, reporters, camera crews and movie fans
crowded hallways.
   Officer Steve Cunningham, the first witness to testify, said
Brando told him he killed the boyfriend of his pregnant sister,
Cheyenne, during a scuffle.
   Brando said the fight broke out when ``the deceased went nuts,''
Cunningham testified.
   ``I didn't mean to shoot him,'' Christian Brando was quoted as
telling Cunningham, the first police officer on the scene.
   Ms. Brando was then seven months pregnant with Drollet's child.
She recently gave birth to a boy in Tahiti, where the Brandos
maintain a home.
   She is said to be suffering from nervous exhaustion and a doctor
told authorities she could not return to California to testify.
   The officer's testimony appeared to support the defense
contention that the .45-caliber handgun went off accidentally
during a scuffle between the 6-foot Brando and the 6-foot-3 Drollet.
   But prosecutors have said they found no evidence of a struggle
and that Drollet was shot while sitting on a sofa, holding a
cigarette lighter in one hand and a television remote control in
the other.

   The spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox
Christians prayed, blessed and kissed a painting of the Virgin Mary
known for tears that attract thousands of pilgrims each year.
   Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I blessed the scarlet and gold
painting Monday at St. Nicholas Albanian Orthodox Church, where
moisture described as tears was first reported near the Madonna's
eyes in 1986.
   He seemed emotionally drained as he turned away from the
painting near the small church's altar in a 20-minute ceremony
attended by about 400 people.
   A crowd estimated by police at 600 waved white flags with the
church's red and gold emblem as the 75-year-old patriarch emerged
from the church.
   ``He is offering prayers to the health of the sick and for
eternal peace for those who have passed away,'' said the Rev. Alex
Karloutsos of the archbishop's office in New York.
   ``He comes not only as the patriarch, but also as a pilgrim,''
Karloutsos said. ``He is here because the Virgin Mary began weeping
and the Virgin plays an important role in our church.''
   The patriarch has appeared tired during his three-day Chicago
visit. Some events on his schedule here have been canceled,
including a meeting with Greek-American and Jewish leaders.
   Dimitrios I, world leader of 180 million to 250 million Eastern
Orthodox Christians, is on a 27-day tour of the United States. His
visit concludes Sunday in Boston, the first visit to North America
by anyone in his office.
   The archbishop has visited Washington, New York, Allentown and
Johnstown, Pa., and San Francisco. He leaves Chicago on Wednesday
for Buffalo, N.Y.
   Christian Orthodoxy is largely divided along national lines,
including Greeks, Russians, Albanians, Serbians, Ukrainians and
others.
   Six million followers of Eastern Orthodoxy live in the United
States, including about 250,000 in Chicago and its suburbs.

<HEAD>Donor Drive Fails to Turn Up Match for Young Leukemia Victim</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A leukemia victim's search for a perfect bone
marrow donor helped triple the number of potential donors in a
national registry, but none of the 50,000 people who volunteered
for blood tests were compatible.
   Instead, 20-year-old Allison Atlas will get an imperfectly
matched transplant from her mother _ before time runs out.
   Thanks to the Atlas family's search, 10 other patients have
found compatible donors since November, said Simon Atlas, a cousin
of Allison's father.
   He said Monday that Miss Atlas, from Bethesda, Md., will be
admitted to the Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle,
probably at the end of this week, to begin week-long preparations
for the transplant.
   Her mother, Arline, ``has been a fallback all along. She's not a
perfect match, obviously, or we would have used her'' at the
outset, Simon Atlas said.
   Miss Atlas is one of about 10,000 Americans a year who search
for a potentially life-saving marrow match from an unrelated donor.
   Largely because of patients like Miss Atlas, public awareness
about transplants has grown over the past eight months.
   Dozens of grassroots groups around the nation have emulated the
campaign of her supporters, Friends of Allison. They implore
neighbors, co-workers, schoolmates and worshipers to take blood
tests and give money. If the particular patient doesn't find a
match, they reason, maybe someone else will.
   Friends of Allison has given blood tests to 49,400 volunteers in
the United States and 600 in Israel since November. The group has
also taken in $3 million in donations to pay for laboratory work.
   The test results were listed with the National Marrow Donor
Program, and a related international registry.
   When the Atlases began their search, the national registry had
gathered 57,000 donors in three years. Now, because of the Atlases
and other families' efforts, it has more than 150,000 names.
   The odds for finding a marrow match are at least 20,000-to-1.

   A burglar washed a stack of dirty dishes
and grabbed a shower before cleaning out the apartment of Stephanie
Pitts.
   Ms. Pitts said her stereo equipment and a long list of other
things were stolen, but the apartment was left spotless.
   The burglar washed the dirty dishes, mopped the kitchen floor
and scrubbed the bathroom tub, Ms. Pitts said.
   He even re-arranged her furniture.
   The break-in was discovered over the weekend when her boyfriend
stopped by her apartment to pick up a dress for Ms. Pitts.
   ``When he got there someone was upstairs taking a shower, but he
just figured one of my sisters had stopped by,'' she said.
   Ms. Pitts said reported the break-in to police.
   ``I was kind of glad the house was cleaned up, but where's my
stuff?'' she said.

<HEAD>City Health Commissioner Shakes Up Department Over Pap Smear
Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials who allowed about 3,000 Pap tests
to languish for a year betrayed the public trust, Health
Commissioner Woodrow Myers said before firing a top aide in the
scandal.
   After the delay, 11 tests revealed cancerous cells, 93 showed
pre-cancer conditions and 600 contained other abnormalities.
   No women have died as a result of the mishandling, but some
could be at risk, Myers said.
   Mismanagement and poor supervision caused ``critical delays,''
Myers told reporters Monday.
   The scandal involved Pap tests administered to about 3,000 women
at city-run clinics. The tests were allowed to accumulate for a
year without laboratory analysis.
   Pap smears test women for cervical and uterine cancer.
   Myers announced a departmental shakeup that included the firing
of Dr. Kenneth Dressler, former assistant commissioner in the
department's bureau of laboratories.
   The health commissioner also announced Norman Scherzer, former
assistant commissioner for epidemiology and prevention services,
and John Miles, former director of the Sexually Transmitted Disease
Department, were being reassigned within the department.
   Dr. Stephen Schultz, former deputy commissioner for epidemiology
and prevention services, already has been reassigned from
administrative to clinical duties.
   Myers said investigators found that department policies since
1988 ``have resulted in an outrageous insensitivity to women who
rely on this department.''
   He said all but two of 104 women whose test results were most
ominous have been located. Myers conceded there was a ``very low''
prospect for finding the other two, one of whom he said had used a
false name. The other was wanted by the FBI, Myers said.
   He said all of the tests that went unread have since been
analyzed and department laboratories will return results within a
week.

<HEAD>Dollar Generally Lower; Gold Prices Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
early trading in Europe today, following sharp declines overnight
in New York. Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said the market was likely to wait for the resumption of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange to see whether Monday's
decline continued.
   ``We want to see if the Dow Jones (stock index) recovers or
remains under pressure,'' said a dealer at a large Frankfurt bank.
``That will be the big indicator for the dollar today.''
   However, in Tokyo, where trading ends before it begins in
Europe, the dollar rose to close at 148.70 yen, up 0.20 yen from
Monday's close of 148.15. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted
at 148.45.
   Tokyo dealers said the currency was strengthened over news of
increasing unrest in the Persian Gulf, prompting purchases of
dollars, regarded as a safe haven.
   They said trading picked up after a Washington Post report today
that Iraq had moved 30,000 troops to its border with Kuwait and the
United States had ordered its warships in the Gulf on alert.
   In London, the pound also strengthened against the dollar. A
pound cost $1.8225, more expensive than $1.8215 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.6226 West German marks, down from 1.6278
   _ 1.3805 Swiss francs, down from 1.3880
   _ 5.4435 French francs, down from 5.4598
   _ 1.1833 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8430
   _ 1,188.00 Italian lire, down from 1,192.00
   _ 1.1558 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1568
   Gold was quoted at $368.25 an ounce at the morning fixing in
London, compared with $368.15 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at a bid price of $368.00, up from
$367.75 bid late Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $6.97 to close at a bid $369.25.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid price of $4.90 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Monday.

   There was rain in Maine early today, but skies were dry
elsewhere after a night of showers throughout the United States.
   Showers and thunderstorms Monday produced high winds that
knocked down trees in southern Mississippi and produced a tornado
in southern Florida near Okeechobee.
   Rain extended from eastern Virginia to New England on Monday and
fell in parts of Michigan, Nebraska, Minnesota, Colorado, Wyoming
and New Mexico.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended from the southern half
of Texas to Florida and Georgia.
   Rain fell early today in Portland, Maine.

<HEAD>Officials: W. Germany To Begin Shipping Out Chemical Arms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will begin removing
its chemical weapons from West Germany this week and will ship them
a U.S. atoll in the Pacific, where they will be destroyed in an
incinerator, officials said.
   The West German Defense Ministry said Monday in a statement that
the operation to remove the 100,000 artillery rounds will begin
Thursday.
   A U.S. army spokesman in West Germany said he was awaiting
confirmation from Washington and could not confirm that date.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former President Reagan agreed in
1986 to remove the weapons by 1992. President Bush advanced the
timetable to 1990, said James Boyle, a spokesman for Headquarters
U.S. Army, Europe.
   Boyle said the artillery shells _ in 6-inch-diameter and 8-inch
sizes _ are loaded with liquid nerve agents.
   He said they have been stored since 1968 at a U.S. military site
in Clausen, a small town near the U.S. military complex at
Kaiserslautern in southwestern West Germany.
   ``This is the most well-planned operation we've had here as far
as the transport of munitions. There is safety measure upon safety
measure redundant throughout the operation,'' Boyle said.
   Each convoy will include 20 flatbed trucks loaded with the
chemical weapons stored in two air-tight steel containers and 60
other escort trucks, including German and U.S. security forces,
emergency crews and decontamination teams, he said.
   Boyle said there would be about 30 convoys, running one a day.
   The trucks will travel a variety of routes, for safety and
security reasons, from Clausen to a U.S. depot at Miesau about 30
miles away, he said.
   The containers will be loaded onto special trains at Miesau for
the trip north to Nordenham, on the North Sea, where they will be
reloaded onto U.S. Navy ships for transport to Johnston Atoll in
the Pacific.
   Boyle said the chemical weapons will be destroyed later in a
specially built incinerator on the U.S. atoll, about 800 miles
southwest of Hawaii.
   Joe Badilla, an Army spokesman in Washington, said the
administration first had to certify to Congress, on Tuesday at the
latest, that the incinerator was working. Once that was done,
shipment from West Germany could begin, he said.
   Officials said the removal operation was expected to be
completed before October.

<HEAD>Trial Highlights Fears of Anti-Semitism in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moscow man went on trial today in a packed and
raucous courtroom on charges of inciting intolerance of Jews in a
case that highlights fears of growing anti-Semitism among Russians.
   But Judge A.I. Muratov postponed the trial of Konstantin
Smirnov-Ostashvili after only a few minutes of procedural work and
two breaks because of the crush of reporters hemming the docket and
noisy viewers who shouted ``Shame!'' at him.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili, 64, was arrested for allegedly organizing
protesters who broke up a meeting Jan. 18 at the Central House of
Literature in Moscow and insulted Jewish writers.
   If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to five years in
prison.
   The case has received wide publicity in the Soviet press at a
time when Soviet Jews are emigrating by the thousands, many because
they fear a wave of anti-Semitic attacks by extreme Russian
nationalists groups like Pamyat.
   Speaking to reporters from the docket during a break in the
case, Smirnov-Ostashvili denied being anti-Semitic but charged that
the Soviet Union's 1.4 milion Jews hold a disproportionate number
of high places in government and society.
   ``A Russian person is brought to trial in the center of Russia
... for insulting, injuring the dignity, and for instigating
intolerance against those who enjoy massive privileges, and who
hold the leading posts in our society,'' he said.
   ``Even if I am accused and punished, in no instance will I agree
with the punishment because no one can show me that I somehow,
somewhere, broke the law,'' said the defendant, a short, emphatic
man with a fringe of gray hair around his bald head.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili said his was the first such case brought to
trial under a law passed as the Soviet Union grapples with
widespread ethnic unrest.
   He said he was not certain whether the judge and two civilian
assistants would consider the case as a purely legal matter, or
consider its political implications. Convicting him would further
polarize Soviet society, he said.
   A 36-year-old Jewish psychiatrist in the crowd who identified
himself only as Eduard said the case would test whether Soviet
courts, traditionally considered arms of the ruling Communists, had
become fairer.
   Among those in the front row of the crowd were two well-known
progressives, writer Ales Adamovich, and historian Yuri Afanasiev.
   More than 71,000 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union after
travel laws were eased last year, and thousands more have left so
far this year. Jewish leaders have cited ``an unprecedented panic
among the Jewish population.''
   Judge Muratov adjourned the case for a day after rejecting
Smirnov-Ostashvili's bid to dismiss his court-appointed attorney,
and before the defendant could enter a plea.
   Members of the crowd, packed into wooden benches in the stuffy
courtroom of the Moscow City Court building, shouted ``Shame!'' at
the judge when he denied Smirnov-Ostashvili's bid.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili had told the court he wanted to dismiss
defense lawyer Svetlana Birulina because he did not trust the
Moscow lawyers association to which she belongs. He also told the
court that the majority of Soviet lawyers are Jewish.
   In a report on the January confrontation at the Central House of
Literature, the popular weekly Ogonyok quoted one of the protesters
as saying through a megaphone:
   ``Your time is over. Neither the police, nor the KGB, nor the
party will help you. Now we will be the masters of the country, and
you, newcomers, clear out and go to Israel. How long can we
tolerate your Russophobia?''
   In an editorial on Sunday, the Communist Party daily Pravda
called for the country to recognize that anti-Semitism exists, and
to find a solution.

   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Senators are reacting cautiously to David H.
Souter's nomination to the Supreme Court, most conceding they know
little about him even though they confirmed him as a federal
appeals judge three months ago.
   ``I want to get to know him, get to know his record so I can
make a considered decision, and I'm sure he'll be fine,'' Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Monday after President Bush chose Souter
to succeed retired Justice William Brennan.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said senators must ``determine
whether he possesses a strong commitment to the fundamental values
of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights'' while Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., said he wanted to know more about Souter's record as New
Hampshire attorney general.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, called Souter ``pretty much of a
blank slate.''
   All four are members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which
will hold confirmation hearings on Souter. There, questions are
bound to be raised about his views on abortion and other matters.
   Most senators said, however, they would not break tradition and
ask Souter point-blank how he would decide the abortion issue if
confirmed. But they said the topic was guaranteed to come up.
   ``People are very much focused on the abortion issue and,
frankly, I think that's a mistake,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
said today on the ``CBS This Morning'' television show. ``I do not
think there ought to be a single litmus test for a nominee for the
Supreme Court.
   That judgment was seconded by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who
said on CBS: ``The president avoided making this a litmus test
candidate. I would hope the Senate would avoid making it a litmus
test candidate.''
   However, Leahy acknowledged earlier that ``it would be naive to
think that Roe vs. Wade in one form or another is not going to be
part of a lot of the questions.'' He was referring to the 1973
Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion.
   Meanwhile, conservative groups reacted favorably to Souter's
appointment while pro-choice and civil rights organizations urged
caution.
   Souter aroused no controversy when the Senate approved him as a
judge of the 1st U.S. Court of Appeals in April. As a result, his
confirmation proceedings apparently blurred into those of numerous
other judicial candidates, at least for some senators.
   Judicial candidates are screened by the FBI, the American Bar
Association, the Judiciary Committee staff and various court
watchdog groups. But their hearings are often love fests with a
friendly senator presiding, and confirmation frequently comes
without a formal vote with only a skeleton crew of senators on the
floor.
   One lawmaker who has known Souter for years, Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., described him as ``the classic conservative intellectual''
but added that the nominee ``cannot be described as an ideologue in
any way, shape or form.''
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said he had known Souter since they
both were attorneys general of their states. ``He was an excellent
attorney general, so my initial reaction is positive,'' Gorton said.
   The top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina, said Souter's brief time on the federal
bench and lack of a controversial record should keep him safe from
initial opposition.
   Simon said the same but added that he was concerned about a pair
of cases handled by Souter when he was New Hampshire attorney
general. One involved the issue of separation of church and state
while the other concerned voting rights, Simon said.
   ``It would be a terrible injustice to confirm a nominee without
knowing that he is committed to protecting Americans' fundamental
constitutional rights, including privacy and the right to choose,''
said Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action
League.
   ``We are pleased that President Bush says he is nominating a
justice who will interpret the Constitution according to its text
and who will not legislate from the bench,'' said a statement from
the National Right to Life Committee.
   But Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority, said:
``The Senate Judiciary Committee members must demand to know his
position on abortion rights. Our lives are on the line and for once
in political decision-making women's lives must come first.''
   Republican National Committee spokesman Charlie Black called
Souter ``an excellent choice.''
   ``Judge Souter is an intelligent person who will be a fair
arbiter of the law,'' Black said.
   ``He's a pig in a poke, a Sununu special,'' said Harvard law
Professor Alan Dershowitz. ``How can we be expected to confirm a
nominee that no one knows anything about?'' White House chief of
staff John Sununu, as governor of New Hampshire, appointed Souter
to that state's Supreme Court.
   Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of the United Conservatives of
America, said in a statement that the Souter nomination represented
a ``first step'' for Bush ``in repairing the split between himself
and the conservatives, his most important constituency.''

   A detective testified that he lied about
non-existent fingerprints to get a teen-ager to confess to taking
part in the Central Park jogger attack.
   Defendant Yusef Salaam, 16, repeatedly told Detective Thomas
McKenna he was not in the park the night of the attack, the law
officer said on the witness stand Monday.
   Convinced the boy had been there during the so-called
``wilding'' attack, McKenna said: ``We have fingerprints from the
jogger's pants. They're satin and very smooth. We'll compare those
prints with yours, and if they match you don't have to say
anything. You're going for rape.''
   McKenna said Salaam then told him: ``I was there but I didn't
rape her.''
   The detective admitted under cross-examination that he knew of
no such fingerprints and that his reference to them was a lie.
Police found no fingerprints at the crime scene where the
investment banker was beaten unconscious, gang-raped and left for
dead.
   Courts have upheld the use of deceit by police to extract
confessions as long as the accused were not threatened, coerced or
improperly advised of their rights.
   After Salaam's alleged confession, McKenna said he then asked:
``How could you possibly do something like this?''
   ``It was just something to do; it was fun,'' McKenna quoted
Salaam as saying, referring to handwritten notes.
   The April 19, 1989, attack was allegedly carried out by a gang
of youths roving the park looking for random victims _ a practice
known by the slang term ``wilding.''
   Salaam admitted hitting the woman with a pipe and fondling her,
and gave the names of other youths who allegedly assaulted her,
McKenna testified. Unlike other defendants, Salaam gave police no
videotaped or signed written statement.
   Salaam's lawyer, Robert Burns, denied his client made the
statements that McKenna recounted. He tried unsuccessfully to get
the testimony barred from the trial.
   Salaam, Antron McCray, and Raymond Santana, all 16, are being
tried on charges of rape, attempted murder, sexual abuse, assault,
robbery and riot in connection with the attack on the woman and
less serious attacks on two male joggers.
   The woman, now 30, is back at work at Salomon Brothers Inc.
investment banking firm, but suffers from impaired vision and
balance and has lost her sense of smell as a result of the assault.
   Three other youths charged in the attack are to stand trial
later this year.

<HEAD>Thousands Homeless in Lake Baikal Flooding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe flooding caused by heavy rainfall in the
Lake Baikal region of Siberia has killed a number of people and
left thousands homeless, the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossia said
today.
   More than 400 bridges were swept away as rivers flowing into
Lake Baikal overflowed their banks during the rainfall in early
July, the newspaper said. Power and water supplies in the region
have been disrupted.
   The newspaper said a number of people died in the flooding, but
did not give a death toll.
   In the city of Chita, 2,500 miles east of Moscow, residents
ignored warnings by officials to take precautions against the
predicted rainstorms.
   ``Several days before the flood, we had arranged for a special
car with a loudspeaker to mve along the streets of the city warning
people about the danger,'' said Chita Mayor Yuri Timofeev. ``But,
people only laughed at us.''
   According to Sovietskaya Rossia, the flooding caused $635
million in damages, including $270 million in farm damage. More
than 600 cattle and 10,000 sheep drowned in the flooding, the
report said.
   The newspaper said a regional task force has been set up to deal
with the emergency.
   Sovietskaya Rossia said meteorologists were predicting more rain
in August.
   The newspaper blamed much of the damage on the intentional
destruction of forests in the region. ``The situation is aggravated
by the fact that thoughtless, large-scale, wood-felling renders the
region particularly vulnerable to any summer rains,'' it said.

<HEAD>Troops Capture Key Rebel Village</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops have captured a key
northern village in fierce fighting that left 30 Tamil rebels dead,
military officials said today.
   The village controls access to the Jaffna peninsula, where the
rebels are based.
   Four soldiers were killed in the Monday attack, in which
helicopters dropped troops and commandos behind rebel defenses to
take the village of Paranthan, officials said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Paranthan is seven miles south of Elephant Pass, a causeway that
links the Jaffna peninsula with the mainland.
   The capture of Paranthan could provide a launching pad for
attacks on Jaffna, which the Tamil Tiger rebels have held since
they repudiated a cease-fire with government forces on June 11.
   The rebels control all of Jaffna, except for four government
bases that have been under siege for more than a month. Almost one
million civilians, mostly ethnic Tamils, live on the peninsula.
   Tamil militants took up arms in 1983, claiming their community
was being discriminated against in jobs, education and language by
the Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's
16 million people. Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75
percent of the population and control the army and the government.
   At least 13,800 people have died in the Tamil insurrection.
   Last week, the rebels blew up the Elephant Pass causeway, the
only viable route for a large-scale crossing into the peninsula.
   Military officials said the causeway has since been repaired.
   At least 2,890 combatants have been killed in fighting since the
rebels violated the June cease-fire.
   The latest casualties included eight soldiers killed Monday near
the east coast port of Trincomalee in a rebel ambush, military
officials said.
   Another soldier was killed near Batticaloa, south of
Trincomalee, they said.
   When the fighting began last month, the rebels held the
Tamil-dominated areas on the north and east of the island. The army
has dislodged the rebels from most towns in the east, and the
guerrillas have retreated into the jungles to fight what could be a
protracted war.
   In the north, the army has been unable to make significant
headway because of the difficult access to Jaffna.

<HEAD>Maples Speaks Out On Trump Divorce Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marla Maples, the woman who has been
romantically linked to millionaire developer Donald Trump, says his
estranged wife, Ivana, is a cold woman who is neglecting her
children.
   Ivana is ``out every night in London and New York, going on
dates to her society parties, while Donald is home raising the
children,'' Maples said in an interview published today in the
Daily News.
   Mrs. Trump disputed the charges.
   ``I see my children every single day,'' she said through
spokeswoman Lisa Calandra. ``Donald sees them once a week at most _
and has gone weeks on end without seeing them at all.''
   Maples also insisted that Ivana ``had to know'' that she and
Donald were an item. After all, she would have.
   ``There is no way (Ivana) could not have known. When I'm seeing
someone, I know every little thing,'' Maples said. ``I'm psychic.
And a woman better keep her eyes open.''
   Maples also claims she's not responsible for the Trumps'
separation: ``I had nothing to do with Donald's marriage. I'm not a
homewrecker.''
   When asked if she would marry Trump, Maples said, ``Of course I
would think about it, of course. This could be a story with a very
beautiful ending.''
   But would she sign a prenuptial agreement? Never, she said.
   ``That makes the relationship too shallow. You fall in love with
love, not money.''
   Maples and her publicist, Chuck Jones, have been subpoenaed and
are expected to give depositions at an Aug. 20 hearing on the
validity of the agreement Mrs. Trump signed in December 1987.
   Mrs. Trump, who is seeking half her husband's assets, said in
court papers that had she been aware of her husband's ``adultery
and philandering,'' she would not have entered into a contract
limiting her to $25 million and a $7 million mansion in the event
of a split.
   Besides battling his estranged wife, Trump has been battling
financial problems. He recently agreed to a $65 million bailout
plan, under which a group of banks put the Trumps on a monthly
allowance of $450,000.

<HEAD>Indians Reject New Talks, Vow More Road Blockades</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Quebec government has offered to resume
talks with Mohawks over a land dispute, but Indian representatives
rejected the offer and some said they would close more roads across
Canada today in protest.
   The Canadian province's native affairs minister, John Ciaccia,
said Monday the government was ready to resume the talks and would
agree to have human rights representatives as observers.
   But he said the talks should be held away from the barricades
where the Mohawks and police have faced each other for nearly two
weeks in an armed standoff involving the land claim dispute.
   Last week, the Mohawks asked observers from the United Nations
or Amnesty International to monitor the talks.
   The Red Cross, one of the few groups that has been allowed
beyond the barricades by Quebec provincial police, would be
permitted to continue providing food and supplies, Ciaccia said,
meeting another Mohawk demand for free movement of food and
medicine.
   But Ellen Gabriel, speaking for the Mohawks at a news conference
Monday night, rejected the main condition that the negotiations
take place outside the Oka barricades and exclude representatives
from the Akwesasne reserve, which straddles the Ontario, Quebec and
New York state borders.
   She said the Mohawks fear the provincial police.
   ``How can we feel safe outside these barricades when they won't
even let food and water through?'' she said.
   The conflict began July 11 when Quebec provincial police stormed
a 4-month-old roadblock set up by Kanesatake Mohawks to stop the
expansion of an Oka golf course on land they claim. An officer was
killed in a gunbattle, but it was unclear whether it was from
Mohawk or police fire.
   Ciaccia, who had held negotiations near the barricades until
talks broke down about a week ago, did not say where he'd like new
talks to be held.
   In an interview, Ciaccia said the proposal to have talks outside
the barricades is ``not for security reasons but to create an
atmosphere of calm.''
   While the barricades remain at Oka, 30 miles west of Montreal, a
blockade by the Kahnawake Mohawks of the Mercier Bridge continues,
forcing thousands of people to find other ways to get into the city
from the south shore of Montreal island.
   A new commuter train service went into effect Monday, but only
550 people took advantage of the service.
   Indians in British Columbia and Saskatchewan vowed to close more
roads today in support of Quebec's Mohawks.
   ``Chiefs definitely are prepared to shut the country down,''
said Lawrence Courtoreille, Alberta spokesman for the Assembly of
First Nations.
   ``Natives have been talking about that possibility for years,''
he said, noting that major highways, main railway lines and hydro
lines run through reserves, making them vulnerable to attack.
   There were 12 road blockades in place in British Columbia, and
Saul Terry, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian
Chiefs, said more could go up.
   Peaceful protests in support of the Mohawks continued across the
country Monday in Calgary, Saskatoon, Fredericton and Perth-Andover.

<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old girl received a transplanted
liver and small intestine today in a rare operation that lasted
nearly 14 hours.
   Tracey Kay Gonzales of Corpus Christi, Texas, was in critical
condition and breathing with the help of a respirator in the
intensive care unit at Children's Hospital following the surgery
said hospital spokeswoman Sue Cardillo. The operation began at 5:25
p.m. Monday and ended about 7:10 a.m. today.
   ``Everybody seems to feel it went fairly well,'' Ms. Cardillo
said. ``It will be at least a week before doctors are able to form
any type of prognosis, if then.''
   Ms. Cardillo said the next three days will be especially
critical, and doctors will watch closely to see if the organs are
functioning properly and free of infection.
   Tracey needed the double transplant because of a condition
called short gut syndrome, Ms. Cardillo said. Her liver was damaged
by a high-protein liquid she was fed intravenously since birth.
   ``A child with short gut syndrome has no way to absorb
nutrition,'' Ms. Cardillo said. ``There isn't enough intestine
there to do any good. Her skin is very yellow from the liver
damage.''
   Small intestine transplants have a poor success rate. Since
1983, three adults and three children have died within a year of
their surgeries at Pittsburgh hospitals.
   Tracey has been a patient at Children's Hospital since April 22,
Ms. Cardillo said. The donor of her new organs was not identified.
   The girl's large intestine, or colon, functions normally.
   An estimated 2,000 children are born with short gut syndrome in
the United States every year.
   Dr. John Fung announced earlier this year what he called the
world's first successful small intestine transplant on a man who
was shot in the abdomen.
   The man, who was not identified, was able to eat after the April
operation but still was recovering, Fung told the University of
Pittsburgh's board of trustees.
   Three-year-old Tabatha Foster of Madisonville, Ky., died 192
days after a 1987 transplant of parts of her stomach and colon and
her pancreas, liver and small intestine.
   Rolandrea ``Rolly'' Dodge, another 3-year-old girl from
Fruitland, N.M., died three months after her November 1988
transplant of part of her colon and her stomach, pancreas, liver
and small intestine.
   An unidentified 6-year-old girl died hours after a transplanted
small intestine replaced an organ damaged in a 1983 swimming-pool
accident.

<HEAD>Arab Dies From Wounds, First Army Shooting Death in a Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 18-year-old Palestinian died today of wounds
suffered in an earlier clash with soldiers, Arab reports said. It
was the first death from army gunfire in a month.
   The victim, Mahmud Helal Salame, was shot in the neck July 14 in
a clash between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in the West Bank
village of Beit Lid, Arab reports said. They said he died in Tel
Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv.
   An army spokesman confirmed a Palestinian was shot by troops in
Beit Lid, near Tulkarem, during the mid-July confrontation. He said
the army was checking the reported death.
   The last death in a clash with troops was June 25 when a
25-year-old woman was shot to death in Tulkarem. In June, 10
Palestinians were killed in uprising clashes.
   In the past month, the army has adopted a new policy of avoiding
confrontations with stone throwers in small villages and crowded
refugee camps where many of the uprising deaths have occurred.
   The policy follows the appointment of Defense Minister Moshe
Arens, who took office after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing coalition government was formed June 11.
   Arens has said his policy is to deploy more soldiers along
roadways to protect Jewish settlers as they travel to and from
their homes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Tuesday's death brought to 724 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers and civilians during the 31-month-old revolt
against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   During the uprising, 242 Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
Forty-five Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Also Tuesday, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza staged a
general strike ordered by the Moslem fundamentalist movement Hamas,
or ``zeal.''
   The strike was called to mourn the destruction of Baghdad, the
capital of the Abbasid Islamic empire, by Mongol warriors in 1258.
   Hamas has, in the past, scheduled general strikes to mark
historic dates in Islamic history.

<TEXT>
   The first senior British official to visit China
since Beijing crushed its pro-democracy movement arrived today,
extending a pattern by other Western nations of gradually restoring
political ties.
   Francis Maude, the foreign office minister responsible for Hong
Kong, is the highest-ranking European official to visit China since
the European Community banned high-level government exchanges to
protest Beijing's June 1989 crackdown on the student protests.
   ``As permanent members of the (U.N.) Security Council, we have
many shared interests and common responsibilities in the world.
It's essential that we work together on these,'' Maude told
reporters at the airport.
   His visit coincided with that of former Australian Prime
Minister Gough Whitlam, who met Monday with Chinese Premier Li Peng.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li told Whitlam, ``The
clouds of attempting to isolate China are dispersing as more and
more countries are responding to China's sincere desire for
friendly co-existence with other countries.''
   Most Western nations banned high-level governmental exchanges
after the military crushed the pro-democracy movement, leaving
hundreds dead. But the European Community granted exceptions to
Britain because of its links with Hong Kong and to Portugal,
because of Macao.
   The British colony of Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997
and the Portuguese colony of Macao is to be returned two years
later.
   Observers said Maude's three-day visit could pave the way for
other Western countries to resume diplomatic contacts.
   In recent weeks, high-level officials from Japan and Canada have
also visited China.
   Maude's main mission is to advance discussions on Hong Kong that
stalled after the Chinese crackdown.
   ``The Chinese and British governments have a common
responsibility for promoting stability and prosperity of Hong
Kong,'' Maude said.
   ``During my visit here, I shall be emphasizing to my hosts the
British government's wish to work constructively and positively
with the Chinese to ensure the future of Hong Kong based on the
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law,'' he said.
   Maude was referring to the 1984 Chinese-British agreement to
return Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, and to the
mini-constitution that will govern the island after the turnover.

   Union truck drivers have agreed to support
a strike by workers at 116 supermarkets, and the action could
affect store inventories.
   Rick Sawyer, a spokesman for Local 555 of the United Food and
Commercial Workers, said Monday stores were already running out of
some products.
   ``The meatcutters are out, and meat has a shelf life of a couple
days,'' he said. ``Produce items are the same way. I was in a store
last night, and they were completely out of lettuce.''
   The Teamsters Joint Council voted Monday afternoon to honor the
supermarket workers. The strike began Saturday.
   Council president John Trout said food products from independent
distribution centers may not be delivered. Deliveries from dairies,
breweries, soft drink bottlers, bakeries and laundries also could
be affected.
   But for the time being, the sanctions would not affect
operations at retail chain distribution centers, he said.
   Health care has been the major issue during contract talks, with
the union pressing for employers to continue paying the full cost
of benefits. The employers have been trying to get employees to
assume part of the rising costs.
   The workers, who have not had a pay increase since 1986, also
are seeking wage increases greater than the 2{ percent yearly boost
management has offered as part of a proposed four-year agreement,
Sawyer said.
   Journeymen clerks now make $11.05 an hour.
   The union represents employees at stores in Multnomah,
Washington, Clackamas, Yamhill and Columbia counties, all in and
around Portland.

   While senators who will vote on David

   ``He's a darling,'' said Mickie Carson, a close friend of the

``Everyone knows David is very special.''
   Souter, 50, has never married. He still lives at the Weare farm
where his family settled in when he was 11. He left there only for
college, law school and to be a Rhodes Scholar in England.
   Mrs. Souter said her son was very close to his father, Joseph,
who died in 1982.
   Carson added that although Mrs. Souter is proud of her son, she
was already thinking Monday that his confirmation would mean he'd
move to Washington and might not be able to continue his weekly
visits.
   Mrs. Souter said any move by the man who ``couldn't be better''
as a son would be painful because she would miss him being nearby.

<TEXT>
   Contracts settled so far this year through
collective bargaining gave workers average annual wage increases of
3.8 percent over the life of the pacts, the government said today.
   The last time parties covered by those settlements negotiated,
usually in 1987 or 1988, average wage gains averaged 2.5 percent
over the contract term, the Labor Department said.
   Part of the gains reflected wage increases that were larger than
those in previous contracts, such as those for workers in
transportation equipment manufacturing, petroleum refining, food
stores and health services.
   In addition, there were wage increases for some workers, such as
those in the steel industry, where there previously had been wage
cuts or freezes, the Labor Department said.
   For the 12-month period ending in June, settlements that were
reached provided wage adjustments averaging 3.6 percent a year over
the contract life, compared with 2.4 percent when the same parties
bargained previously.
   The average annual wage gain over the contract life has been
increasing since the low of 1.7 percent for a 12-month period,
which occurred for the year ending in September 1986.
   The collective bargaining report, like the Labor Department's
broader Employment Cost Index also released today, showed workers
in the fast-growing service sector winning larger wage gains than
manufacturing workers.
   Service workers received an average annual gain of 3.8 percent
over the contract life while manufacturing workers received an
average boost of 3.3 percent.
   The average construction worker received gains of 4.2 percent a
year over the life of the contract, the report said.
   The Labor Department said the 216 collective bargaining
agreements it analyzed in the first six months of 1990 covered
about 810,000 workers. The government tracks agreements covering
bargaining units with at least 1,000 workers.
   The government said 88 such agreements covering about 983,000
workers are scheduled to expire or reopen for wage negotiations
during the July-September period, with many of those jobs in the
automobile, parcel delivery and construction industries.
   In addition, there are about 726,000 workers under 130 contracts
that had expired or been reopened, but not negotiated or ratified,
prior to the end of June. Nearly half those workers are railroad
employees, the government said.

<HEAD>Bank of England Searches for Ukrainian Barrel of Gold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Bank of England researchers today searched
dust-covered, leather-bound account books for records of a barrel
of gold Ukrainian officials said was stored there 270 years ago, a
spokesman said.
   The archive search was prompted by British newspaper reports
that the Soviet republic of Ukraine was claiming compensation for a
barrel of gold left with the bank by the 18th century Ukrainian
military leader, Col. Pavel Polubotok.
   Ukrainian officials reportedly have said the gold plus accrued
interest would be worth $29 trillion. That figure is roughly five
times the U.S. gross national product.
   A spokesman for the Bank of England said a check of the bank's
live accounts and safety deposit accounts made Monday did not turn
up a record of the barrel of gold. He added that gold deposits do
not accrue interest.
   Polubotok was reportedly put in jail by Czar Peter the Great,
where he died in 1723.
   Two researchers are now looking back through 300 years of
defunct accounts preserved on microfilm and in leather-bound
ledgers for a record of any account with Polubotok, the spokesman
said.
   ``If there were a barrel in the vaults we'd know about it,''
said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We have quite a lot of gold as well as valuables and documents
in the vaults which extend over three underground floors,'' he said.
   The Bank of England was a private bank until 1946, when it was
acquired by the government. It is now the government's central
bank, but it continues to provide services for foreign governments
and some private customers.

<HEAD>Souter at White House Preparing for Senate Confirmation Hearings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee for the Supreme
Court, David H. Souter, returned to the White House today for
briefings on the confirmation process in the Senate, where he is
certain to be grilled about his views on abortion and other
divisive social issues.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that the
president would formally submit Souter's nomination on Wednesday,
and that the nominee would then begin making the rounds of members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Souter was meeting today with Frederick D. McClure, Bush's
congressional liaison, to help prepare him with the meetings with
senators.
   ``It is just the normal practice associated with new nominees,''
McClure said in an interview. ``We're going to have a chit chat
about what lies ahead over the next few weeks.''
   McClure said Souter will meet first with members of the Senate
leadership, then with committee members, and with any other
senators who want to meet him.
   ``He's a well-qualified guy. We hope the Senate will agree,''
McClure said.
   Souter spent Monday night at the home of Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., who actively promoted the 50-year-old federal appeals court
judge from his home state.
   Calling Souter ``a remarkable judge of keen intellect and the
highest ability,'' Bush said Monday that he and his advisers had
deemed it ``inappropriate'' to ask Souter his views on specific
issues.
   That will be the task of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
expected to hold hearings in September.
   One liberal committee member, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
pledged, ``There will be a lot more known about him, I guarantee
you that.''
   ``I don't think it'll be a hard sell at all, when you look at
the man's record, experience and integrity and ability to deal with
tough questions of law,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Souter, 50, spent a dozen years as a state judge before joining
the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on April 30.
   If confirmed, he would become the court's 105th justice _ its
sixth bachelor. Never married, he lives alone on the family farm
near Weare, N.H., where he moved from the Boston suburb of Melrose,
Mass., when he was 11.
   Souter has a reputation back home for brilliance and diligence.
Outside New Hampshire, he's barely known.
   The president moved quickly in announcing his intention to
nominate Souter to replace Justice William J. Brennan, 84, who
retired Friday because of ill health.
   Bush on Monday praised Brennan, the court's longtime leading
liberal, as ``one of the greatest figures of our age.'' Brennan's
departure gave Bush his first chance to name someone to the
nation's highest court.
   If he is confirmed, Souter's vote may prove decisive for the
future of legalized abortion, as four of the remaining eight
justices appear ready to overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
that made abortion a constitutional right. Souter has not yet had
to rule directly on abortion.
   Abortion rights groups already have demanded that the Senate
hearings focus on Souter's abortion views.
   The increasingly conservative court also has been closely split
on such issues as civil rights and criminal justice.
   The reaction from key senators was restrained. Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., a Judiciary Committee member and early opponent
of President Reagan's failed nomination of Robert Bork to the
court, said he would wait to hear from Souter before making up his
mind.
   Kennedy said the Senate must determine ``whether he possesses a
strong commitment to the fundamental values of the Constitution and
the Bill of Rights that are obviously at stake in this important
nomination ....''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Souter's
experience as a judge and as New Hampshire's attorney general are
pluses, but did not commit himself.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the Judiciary Committee's
ranking Republican, said he expected few if any fireworks, noting
that Souter was confirmed unanimously for his 1st Circuit Court job.
   But another committee member, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
said, ``There is a difference between being confirmed for the
appeals court and for the Supreme Court.''
   As a member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court for seven years,
Souter established himself as a close-to-the-vest judicial
conservative.
   In one of the rare civil rights cases in which he participated,
Souter joined the state court's ruling in 1987 that said
homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or foster parents.
But the state court ruling also said that homosexuals may not be
barred from running day care centers.
   In a 1986 case, Souter joined the majority in ruling that
doctors have a responsibility to test for birth defects and inform
pregnant women of the option of abortion.
   In a concurring opinion, Souter questioned the impact the
decision would have on doctors who oppose abortion on moral
grounds. He said such physicians should not have to choose
``between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures.''
   Souter was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state Supreme Court
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints.
The nation's highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this
year.
   Alan Dershowitz, a liberal attorney and professor at Harvard Law
School, called the nomination ``a Sununu special.''
   John Sununu, Bush's conservative White House chief of staff, was
the New Hampshire governor who promoted Souter to the state Supreme
Court. But Sen. Warren Rudman, a moderate New Hampshire Republican,
also has been a political patron.

   U.S. Supreme Court nominee David Souter
issued a ruling on the New Hampshire Supreme Court that could be
seen as arguing that doctors should be free to decide whether to
counsel women about abortions.
   Souter agreed with, and issued a concurring opinion in, a 1986
case in which the court said it would not recognize a right not to
be born.
   The ruling dealt with a woman's lawsuit against her doctor,
charging that he did not advise her of the possibility that the
German measles she contracted during pregnancy would result in
birth defects.
   Her daughter was born with multiple birth defects, and she
argued that she should have known of the possibility and been
counseled about the possibility of abortion.
   In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that it had no business
deciding whether such a child would be better off having been
aborted. But it did rule that the parents of children with birth
defects have a right to sue.
   It also held that doctors have a responsibility to test for
birth defects and inform pregnant women of the possibility of
defects to give them the option of abortion.
   ``We recognize that the termination of pregnancy involves
controversial and divisive social issues,'' said the opinion with
which Souter agreed. ``Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of the United
States has held that a woman has a constitutionally secured right
to terminate a pregnancy.''
   The mother, Linda Smith, also made her daughter, Heather, a
plaintiff. But the court rejected the child's suit, saying the
``right to life, and the principle that all are equal under the law
are basic to our constitutional order. To presume to decide that
Heather's life is not worth living would be to forsake these
ideals.''
   Souter agreed with the ruling, and raised an additional question
in a concurring opinion. He wondered what impact the ruling might
have on doctors who don't support abortion, but who were bound to
advise patients of it as an alternative. The court did not address
the question.
   ``The court does not hold that some or all physicians must make
a choice between rendering services that they morally condemn and
leaving their profession in order to escape malpractice
exposures,'' he wrote.
   He suggested that such doctors might tell patients of their
religious or moral scruples and refer them to other doctors in time
for such testing.

<HEAD>Cloud of Cleaning Solvent Blamed in BASF Blast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vapors of a cleaning solvent leaking from
equipment used to mix chemicals led to the deadly explosions and
fire that rocked a chemical plant last week, a fire investigator
said.
   Capt. Jim Mara said Monday that a reactor in the resin building
of the BASF Corp. plant was being cleaned with a chemical solvent
known as PX when a valve apparently ruptured and released the vapor
cloud into the building.
   Investigators still do not know what then ignited the vapor and
triggered the explosion, Mara said.
   ``But we know the reactor, or kettle as it's known, was
over-pressurized, either through mechanical error or human error,''
he said.
   A series of blasts at the plant Thursday killed one worker and
injured at least 68 others, many of them residents of the
surrounding neighborhood who were cut by flying glass. Three people
remained in critical condition today.
   A maintenance foreman at the plant who set off a fire alarm
seconds before the first blast said he was alerted by a cloud of
vapor escaping from the building, where the company handled resins
used in paints and coatings for aluminum food cans.
   ``We know it was the reactor in the resin building, and we know
there was a vapor cloud,'' Mara said. ``The ignition source could
be a hard call, because there are several possibilities.''
   He refused to speculate on the cause.
   Assistant Fire Chief James Ross said damage from the fire has
been set at $50 million.
   Mara said the fact that the first blast struck at about 2:15
p.m. was in part responsible for the low death toll.
   ``Most of the people who work in that area went on break at 2
p.m.,'' he said. ``The call came in at 2:19 p.m. There could have
been at least nine people, maybe more, in the immediate area if
they hadn't been on break.''
   Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials have
begun interviewing survivors.

   A judge who sentenced a battered wife to
eight years in prison for killing and dismembering her former
husband lamented her suffering but said the man didn't deserve to
die.
   Juanita Irene Stinson pleaded guilty in April to murdering
Charles Stinson in 1987. He was shot three times and his body was
cut into six pieces with an ax and buried in a shallow grave.
   Testimony during the trial revealed the woman was the victim of
35 years of physical and mental abuse.
   ``It's a tragedy, the abuse that your husband heaped on you over
the years,'' Judge Frederick C. Wright III said Monday after
hearing testimony from experts who said she suffered from
battered-woman syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder.
   ``I've heard a lot about him _ that he was not a good person,
but people who are not good people deserve to live,'' Wright said.
``Taking an individual's life is never going to be approved by this
court.''
   Ms. Stinson, 57, of Mountain Lake Park lied about Stinson's
whereabouts for two years, saying he was away on business, a
pla  The Times' story on questions surrounding the bailout appeared
July 8, the day before Metzenbaum held a hearing on the subject.
   Howell Raines, the Times' Washington bureau chief, said, ``As a
matter of policy we don't discuss sources or the editorial
process.'' He said the story was ``meticulously researched from a
number of sources'' and ``was industriously and honorably
reported.''
   Nancy Coffey, a spokeswoman for Metzenbaum, said the senator
considered Brand's complaint too ridiculous to comment on.
   ``Since when is it against the law for a senator to talk to one
reporter?'' she asked, adding that ``no prearrangements'' were
attached to Metzenbaum's comments.
   Meanwhile, the Times reported in today's editions that Thompson
invested $100,000 with a federal regulator, Paul G. Heafy, who also
was involved in Thompson's negotiations to buy an insolvent bank in
Oklahoma.
   The newspaper reported that the investment, which was to buy
distressed loans from federal regulators, did not violate conflict
of interest laws, but Senate investigators wanted to look into the
financing of the deal.
   Heafy is chief liquidator for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in Oklahoma City. The Times said he and Thompson refused the
Times' requests for interviews.

   A congressional panel asked a special
prosecutor today to broaden his probe of former Housing Secretary
Samuel Pierce, saying it has evidence Pierce steered money to
clients of his former law firm and may have committed perjury.
   In urging independent counsel Arlin Adams to expand his
investigation, the House Government Operations housing subcommittee
said its 14-month-long probe uncovered ``widespread abuses,
influence peddling, blatant favoritism, monumental waste and gross
mismanagement'' at HUD.
   The subcommittee specifically asked Adams to widen his
investigation into three areas of possible wrongdoing:
   _Whether Pierce committed perjury during the only appearance
before the subcommittee, on May 25, 1989, in which the former
Cabinet officer gave detailed testimony. The congressional panel
said many of Pierce's statements were contradicted by subsequent
testimony. Pierce essentially maintained that he did not play a
direct role in the awarding of housing projects.
   _Whether Pierce conspired with others to steer HUD business to
clients of Battle, Fowler, Jaffin and Kheel, the Wall Street law
firm where Pierce formerly had been a partner. It also questions
whether Pierce conspired with his former top aide, Lance Wilson, in
connection with contract awards.
   _Whether Pierce and other HUD officials ``conspired to defraud''
the government in the handling of the Department of Housing and
Urban Development's coinsurance program, which provided backing for
housing development projects during the Reagan administration from
1981-89.
   The letter came as the eight-member panel neared an end to its
investigation of the HUD scandal. A subcommittee source, discussing
the panel's role on grounds of anonymity, said no more hearings are
scheduled. The aide said the subcommittee hopes to complete a final
report, with recommendations for reforms at HUD, sometime in late
August.
   The letter said documents found in HUD files show that Pierce's
former law firm frequently sought Pierce's assistance in
HUD-related matters. It said they included having Pierce meet with
a client to discuss a development grant application and helping
securing lucrative housing subsidies.
   It cited a letter from a partner in the firm to Pierce's
assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, in 1985 seeking her help in obtaining
a subsidy for an Amherst, N.Y., project, and recounting past
assistance in another project there, Allenhurst Apartments.
   ``In light of Secretary Pierce's long and close relationship
with his former law firm, Battle, Fowler, it defies logic and
reason that Ms. Dean would have assisted Battle, Fowler in
obtaining these scarce and much-in-demand (subsidy) units for the
Allenhurst project on her own without the direct and intimate
involvement of Secretary Pierce,'' the letter said.
   Pierce was expected to return to the firm, but has instead spent
much of the past year working with a team of lawyers defending
himself against allegations of favoritism raised by the
subcommittee and now Adams.
   Thousands of pages of HUD documents released through the Freedom
of Information Act last year included dozens of letters from
Battle, Fowler lawyers to top Pierce aides. But the law firm and
Pierce, through his attorneys, have denied any favoritism.
   Several members of the subcommittee, including Chairman Tom
Lantos, D-Calif., have repeatedly said Pierce may have committed
perjury during a May 1989 appearance before the panel.
   At that appearance, the former secretary portrayed himself as a
hands-off manager and said he took no direct role in funding
decisions. Subsequent witnesses and documents released after Pierce
testified indicated that Pierce had indeed played major roles in
numerous funding decisions, including several for projects
involving associates or prominent Republicans.
   Pierce's lawyers have said their review of the testimony and
documents indicated no wrongdoing by Pierce.
   Pierce again appeared before the subcommittee and vehemently
denied any wrongdoing while accusing the panel of targeting him for
criticism and investigation. But Pierce refused to answer
questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment protection against possible
self-incrimination.
   The silence of Pierce and several former top aides who also
refused to testify has left many questions unanswered 15 months
after HUD's inspector general set of a firestorm by releasing a
report that concluded the department's costly Moderate
Rehabilitation Program was riddled with mismanagement and political
favoritism.
   Acting on a request from Congress, Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh in March sought and won the court appointment of Adams.
At that time Adams, a former federal judge, was charged with
investigating the role of Pierce and top aides in the Moderate
Rehabilitation Program.
   Since then, Adams' jurisdiction has been broadened to include
Pierce's administration of Urban Development Action Grants and the
secretary's discretionary fund for technical assistance and other
special projects.

   Kenjiro Takayanagi, known as the father of Japanese
television, has died of pneumonia, company officials said today. He
was 91.
   Takayanagi died Monday night in a hospital in Yokosuka, near
Tokyo, the officials said.
   An electrical engineer, Takayanagi achieved the first television
transmission in Japan in 1926 and developed the main component of a
television camera in 1933 only months after it was invented by
Vladimir K. Zworykin in the United States.
   After teaching at a Japanese college, he worked for the Japan
Broadcasting Co. (NHK) and then at the Victor Co. of Japan, where
he later became vice president.
   Masaru Ibuka, honorary chairman of competitor Sony Corp., told
Kyodo News Service that ``(Takayanagi) was a true technician who
developed the television, which people had only dreamed about, from
nothing.''
   Takayanagi was awarded by the Japanese government with the Order
of Culture in 1981, the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred
Treasure in 1989 and various other prizes for his work in advancing
television technology.
   Takayanagi was born in Hamamatsu in central Japan in 1899.
   Funeral arrangements were pending, and there was no immediate
word of survivors.

   Jury selection began this morning under
heavy security in the trial of Alice Lundgren, accused of helping
her cult-leader husband and 11 others kill a family of five.
   Lake County Common Pleas Judge Paul H. Mitrovich convened the
proceedings with 40 prospective jurors in the the first trial
stemming from the 1989 killings.
   Mrs. Lundgren, 39, and 12 others, including husband Jeffrey and
their 19-year-old son, Damon, were arrested earlier this year in
the deaths of Dennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl, and their three young
daughters.
   Lundgren is a defrocked minister of the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The Averys were among Lundgren's
followers.
   Mrs. Lundgren has pleaded innocent in Lake County Common Pleas
Court to five counts each of conspiracy to commit aggravated
murder, complicity to commit aggravated murder, and kidnapping. If
convicted, she faces a possible life sentence.
   As jury selection got under way, at least three sheriff's
deputies stood guard outside the courtroom near a metal detector.
   Police have said that the Avery family was killed April 17,
1989, at a farm in nearby Kirtland, where Jeffrey Lundgren directed
the cult. The corpses, buried under a barn on the farm, were not
found until early this year.
   Authorities have speculated the deaths may have been a religious
sacrifice. Mrs. Lundgren is the first of the cult members to stand
trial in the case. Four cult members pleaded guilty to reduced
charges and agreed to testify for the prosecution.

Obscenity Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A record store owner who refused to stop
selling a controversial 2 Live Crew album pleaded innocent today to
a charge of promoting obscene material.
   David Risher, owner of Hog Wild Records and Tapes, was released
on a personal recognizance bond after a hearing before County
Court-At-Law Judge Tony Jimenez III.
   ``Your tax money at work,'' Risher said as he was ushered off to
be fingerprinted and booked.
   Risher's attorney said he intends to show in a jury trial that
the album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' is not obscene.
   ``After listening to the album, most of the four-letter words
are standard locker room talk,'' defense attorney Bob Switzer said.
   Risher was charged with the Class A misdemeanor last month after
a citizen complaint was filed against him for selling the album.
   The complaint followed a crackdown by the San Antonio police
vice squad. Officers went to record stores around the city and told
store operators the album had been declared obscene by a Florida
judge. The officers also showed the store operators copies of the
album's lyrics.
   Many record stores pulled the albums from their shelves. But
Risher refused. If convicted, he could face up to one year in jail,
a $1,000 fine or both.

   At least 82 people were shot to
death by soldiers during the first four weeks of the 1968
Soviet-led military invasion, according to a declassified
government report published today.
   The first six victims were shot at 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 21, 1968 _
the day Warsaw Pact troops and tanks rolled in _ according to the
Interior Ministry report.
   The declassified report was carried in the Obcansky Denik daily,
which said only five top Communist Party officials had been privy
to it immediately after the invasion. The invasion crushed attempts
at democratic reforms in Czechoslovakia.
   The first shootings occurred near the city of Liberec, about 65
miles north of Prague, the paper reported.
   ``During the occupation of Czechoslovakia by the armies of the
five states of the Warsaw Treaty ... its members used various
weapons against Czechoslovak citizens like machine guns, submachine
guns and artillery ... killing 82 people, seriously wounding 302
and causing light wounds to more than 500,'' the daily said.
   Romania was the only Warsaw Pact country that refused to take
part in the invasion.
   ``The killing and injuries occurred both in direct shooting
against groups of people and individuals, as well as in shooting
against buildings and in the air, when people were shot in their
apartments, on balconies...and in some cases even by deflected
bullets,'' the daily said.
   The report was the first in a series published in advance of the
22nd anniversary of the invasion.
   The invasion restored hard-line Communism in Czechoslovakia, and
Communist rule was sustained for another 21 years.
   Democratic changes swept Communists from power in Czechoslovakia
last year and brought dissident playwright Vaclav Havel to the
office of president.
   On Nov. 28, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
condemned the 1968 invasion. Hungary's Parliament on Monday
demanded a similar reassessment of the Soviets' 1956 intervention
in Hungary to crush an anti-Stalinist uprising.
   Today in Prague, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov said the 1956 invasion of Hungary was ``inadmissable.''
   ``I do not know of this (the Hungarian) request, but we are in
the process of reassessing our history right now,'' Gerasimov told
reporters.
   According to Western estimates up to 32,000 people were killed
in the Hungarian invasion.
   There have never been any estimates given of the death toll in
the Czechoslovak invasion, but most of the shooting occurred in the
first few days.

   Wall Street may have mended many of its ways
since the excessive 1980s, but it still hasn't found an antidote
for the ``Blue Monday'' syndrome.
   The tendency for volatile selloffs to occur right after weekends
repeated itself Monday when the Dow Jones industrial average, fresh
from a series of runs at record highs above 3,000 points, took its
worst plunge in six months.
   The average, an index of stocks in 30 of the country's
best-known industrial corporations, dropped more than 100 points in
the first 90 minutes of trading, then fluctuated through much of
the day in heavy trading. At the close, it was down 56.44 points,
or 1.9 percent, at 2,904.70.
   The selloff wiped out a big chunk of the early-summer gains
posted by some of the nation's most prominent blue-chip stocks, and
analysts placed much of the blame on a rash of disappointing
corporate earnings.
   Other catalysts for the fall, they said, ranged from revived
fears of higher interest rates to continued anxiety over the
federal deficit.
   This morning, the Dow industrial average traded within a narrow
range. It was up 0.50 at 2,905.20 at 11 a.m. on Wall Street. An
hour earlier, the average sported a gain of 5.70 points.
   Although worrisome, analysts said Monday's drop did not seem to
presage a crisis on the magnitude of the crash of October 1987 or
mini-crash of October 1989.
   Companies as diverse as American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Dow
Chemical and U.S. Shoe posted earnings below expectations for the
quarter ended June 30. Late last week, Texas Instruments and a slew
of computer and technology companies also announced disappointing
profits.
   Investors initially treated the profit reports as individual
cases, dumping shares of the companies involved while leaving other
stocks unscathed. The Dow kept making new highs, benefiting from
enthusiasm for a few of its component issues.
   But on Monday morning, investors' urge to sell broadened,
causing what analyst Michael Metz at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. called ``a
mini-panic.''
   Newton Zinder at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said ``people who
concentrated on the Dow Jones industrial average at 3,000 got a
misleading picture. There had been an underlying erosion over the
last few weeks, with a lot of stocks falling into black holes after
their earnings were released.''
   In mid-July, the Federal Reserve took a step toward easier
credit when Chairman Alan Greenspan declared his intention to keep
the financial system supplied with ample money while the banking
industry retrenched and regrouped.
   But after an initial burst of enthusiasm over that news, both
the bond and stock markets turned wary.
   On Monday, many observers saw evidence of continued worries over
what jolts the economy still might suffer in the unwinding of the
debt boom of the '80s.
   ``A rising tide of debt, even if unsound, immoral or fattening,
is bullish,'' observes James Grant in the current issue of his
newsletter Grant's Interest Rate Observer. ``Having borrowed money,
people spend it.''
   Now, he argues, ``a shrinkage of debt is bearish. Denied new
credit, people don't buy things.''

<HEAD>Indian Guards Kill 20 Moslem Militants in Kashmir</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian frontier guards shot and killed 20
Moslem militants and arrested nine others after they sneaked into
India-held Kashmir from Pakistan, a senior official said today.
   The militants were killed late Monday at Kupwara, 56 miles north
of Srinagar during gunbattle with Indian guards, said the Kashmir
official, who cannot be identified under standing briefing
regulations.
   India, alarmed by a spurt in Moslem separatist activities in
Kashmir, has stepped up border patrol to stop alleged infiltration
of separatists from Pakistan. A total of 80 Moslem militants have
died in frontier incidents in the past week.
   Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly
cross over to Pakistan through the porous border and return by the
same route after reciving arms training in Pakistan.
   Pakistan denies it is training or helping the militants, but
says it supports the separatism, terming it a fight for self
determination.
   The Kashmir official said the fighting erupted when the
militants fired at Indian border guards after crossing over from
Pakistan.
   Indian guards seized 22 AK-47 rifles, three machine guns and
1,425 rounds of ammunitions.
   Kashmiri separatists are fighting for independence of the Moslem
dominated Jammu-Kashmir from the predominantly Hindu India.
   At least five more Moslem separatists were killed in three
separate incidents across Kashmir today.
   The deaths brought the total number of people killed to at least
863 since Jan. 20, when the government launched a crackdown on the
separatists.
   About 65 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems, making it India's only Moslem majority state. Nationwide,
Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million people.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of the population.
   Kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with Pakistan, an
Islamic country, but have recently been fighting for total
independence and the status of a neutral country.

   Government troops killed at least 70
rebels and captured 110 in fighting in eastern Uganda, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
   The Munno newspaper said troops mounted a counterattack Friday
and Saturday after insurgents from the Uganda People's Army killed
three soldiers and later attacked army barracks, burning several
buildings.
   The newspaper said the fighting was in the countryside around
Kumi, a trading town 300 miles from Uganda's capital, Kampala.
   A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the clashes, but said he was unaware of any government
casualties.
   The Uganda People's Army is led by Peter Otai, a former Cabinet
minister. It took up arms against the government of President
Yoweri Museveni soon after Museveni seized power in February 1986.

<HEAD>Gov't Offers Guidelines to Tell Workaholics How to Relax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, concerned that the one skill the
industrious Japanese have yet to master is how to relax, is
offering advice on how hard workers can become happy campers.
   The Health and Welfare Ministry this week released a 38-page
report titled: ``A Study on How to Take Proper Rest and
Recuperation.'' It suggests Japanese forget about their jobve the office
and take leisurely and lengthy vacations,
concepts well-rooted in the West but yet to take hold here.
   To help the nation relax, the government report offers a wide
range os when
they leaf general guidelines.
   For example, it argues that constant overtime work cuts down on
sleep, adversely affects the quality of work and results in
``chronic fatigue physically and mentally, eventually leading to
bad health and illness.''
   The report advises workers to ``go to bed early and get up
early, take breakfast without fail, forget about the job after
hours (and) eat dinner with their families....''
   White-collar Japanese workers often eat and drink with
colleagues after leaving the office and do not get home until late
at night.
   According to government statistics, Japanese workers are on the
job an average of 2,150 hours a year compared with 1,924 hours in
the United States and 1,655 hours in Wuter train
route from Montreal's southern suburbs.
   On Saturday night, two men carried the same sign that led
Friday's procession, showing Indians on horseback chasing a train.
   The men toted the sign away from the barricade, hoping to whip
up another mass march. Only a dozen people follow this time, and
the feeble procession trailed off into a gas station parking lot.
   Two other men carried a cloth banner showing a Mohawk in
feathers with a slash through his face.
   One man in a tweed jacket and maroon tie stood out in the crowd
of people in shorts and T-shirts. He marched through the mob,
carrying a sign in French that reads, ``Give them what they want:
the war.''
   The Indians steal the show Saturday night.
   They set fire to a pile of tires, creating a wall of flame in
front of their barricade that spits a monstrous black cloud over
the town, a smoke signal to let police and townsfolk know they're
still there.
   The crowd in Chateauguay responds with an Indian war cry.
Occasionally, they can see the silhouette of a Mohawk dancing
behind the flames.
   The mob surges forward, and the line of police in riot gear
stiffens, bracing for another rush on the barricade. But a few
sprinkles of rain begin falling, and the crowd begins scurrying for
their cars. By 1 a.m., just a handful of people are left.
   They will return again Sunday night for more junk food and
another march that winds up back where it began.

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's chauffeur testified today
that he drove Barry straight from a ribbon-cutting ceremony to a
city meeting without stopping at a building where prosecutors say
he picked up drugs.
   Walter Bracey, who has served as the mayor's driver for 12
years, testified in Barry's drug and perjury trial that he
transported the mayor directly from the opening of a grocery store
to a meeting with fire officials on the morning of Sept. 7, 1988.
   Prosecution witness Lydia Reid Pearson, an acknowledged drug
dealer, has testified she handed Barry crack cocaine and a city job
application at a city municipal building shortly after 10 a.m. that
day.
   But Bracey testified that Barry arrived at the ribbon-cutting
ceremony at about 9:40 a.m., spent about 45 minutes there, and then
was driven straight to the fire department meeting.
   ``Were there any stops made at any other location?'' Barry
attorney R. Kenneth Mundy asked.
   ``No,'' Bracey replied.
   Earlier, a grocery store employee and a member of a community
group who attended the grand opening testified that Barry spent
about 45 minutes there before leaving.
   Bracey's testimony came on the second day of an assault by Mundy
on Pearson's credibility.
   Pearson originally testified that she has not used cocaine since
June 8, but with the jury out of the courtroom Monday, Mundy called
her back to the stand and asked whether she had visited an
apartment building ``known as a crack house'' on July 7.
   Pearson acknowledged that the building is recognized as a place
where drugs are sold, but she denied visiting there.
   Minutes earlier, with the jury also out of the courtroom, a city
police officer, Otha Batts, testified that he had seen Pearson
visit the building.
   Pearson testified earlier in Barry's drug and perjury trial that
she went to city offices on Sept. 7, 1988, where she met the mayor
and ``handed him ... crack cocaine. ... He gave me the money for
it'' and ``I gave him'' a job application.
   Mundy said he intended to repeat his questions to both the
police officer and Pearson before the jury, but U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson said he will not allow the defense to
pursue that course unless he is first shown a legal precedent for
such a move.
   Mundy promised to research the matter and present an answer.
   The questioning of Pearson followed testimony by a city
employee, Clifton Roberson, that he _ and not Barry _ accepted a
job application from the woman on Sept. 7, 1988.
   Roberson said he saw no evidence of drugs when Pearson visited
his office. He also said he recalled that Pearson was upset because
she was forced to wait for almost 20 minutes before being informed
that neither Barry nor mayoral aide Anita Bonds was present.
   Roberson said Pearson gave him the job application and then left.
   Pearson's testimony for Sept. 7, 1988, forms the basis for one
of 10 cocaine possession charges with which Barry is charged. He
also is accused of one misdemeanor conspiracy count and three
felony counts of lying to a grand jury.

   Doubling the tax on wine as a
deficit-reduction measure would cost state and local governments 32
cents for every $1 collected by the federal government, an industry
group said Tuesday.
   ``Lower business profits and lost wages would reduce tax
collections of state and local governments by an estimated $81
million,'' the Wine Coalition said.
   Doubling taxes on wine and beer is said to be under
consideration by congressional leaders and the Bush administration
as part of a long-range plan to reduce the budget deficit.
   A study commissioned by the industry group concluded that the
higher tax would reduce U.S. wine consumption by about 4 percent to
500 million gallons a year, reduce business activity by $1.1
billion and cost workers in wine and related industries $293
million a year in lost wages.
   Wines are subject to federal taxes ranging from 17 cents a
gallon for table wine to $3.40 a gallon for naturally sparkling.
The levy brought in $270 million last year.

<HEAD>Couple Gets `Money From Heaven' Selling Meteorite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOLSEY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You've heard of pennies from heaven. Would
you believe enough to buy a new car?
   That's roughly how much money Robert and Mildred Eichstadt got
recently for selling a 160-pound meteorite found on their land nine
years ago.
   The couple won't say exactly how much they were paid by Marlin
Cilz, a collector from Malta, Mont. But Mrs. Eichstadt says it was
``a large amount'' and agrees that comparing it to the price of a
new small car is fair.
   ``It's probably the best crop we ever took off of our farm,''
she said.
   The meteorite, about the size of two basketballs, was found on
their farm in eastern South Dakota, near Huron, by their oldest
son, Bruce, when the disc harrow he was using to prepare a field
caught the object and rolled it over.
   ``Bruce knew right away what it was,'' said Mrs. Eichstadt. ``He
said it was a meteorite, that it couldn't be a rock. It's so hard,
it just made a shiny spot on it where the disc hit it.''
   The Eichstadts had no idea it had any value, so they let it sit
in their yard.
   But they began looking to sell it a few months ago after they
saw information about Cilz in a farm publication.
   When Cilz made the Eichstadts an offer, their reaction was,
``This can't be happening to us,'' said Mrs. Eichstadt. ``As soon
as we found out it had some value, we didn't have it setting out
(in the yard) any longer.''
   Cilz estimated that the meteorite fell on the land that is now
the Eichstadts' farm about 2,200 years ago.
   Mrs. Eichstadt says Cilz indicated the meteorite likely will be
cut into pieces to be sold to collectors.

   The Vanderbilt family's 250-room Biltmore
House has some plumbing and electrical problems that could drive
down its value, but the county tax assessor says it's still worth
at least $16 million.
   If the assessment stands, the tax bill will be $109,903. And by
the way, the assessment doesn't include the antiques, art works,
and 8,000 acres of land.
   Biltmore House, opened in 1895, was built by George W.
Vanderbilt, of the railroad and steamship Vanderbilts.
   It's a National Historic Landmark and open to the public, but
it's still owned by the family and may be the nation's largest
preservation project that still pays taxes, says William Cecil, a
grandson of George W. Vanderbilt.
   Buncombe County tax assessor Charles Clark spent a month going
over the house.
   Tourists, he said, don't see ``a circuit board that was designed
in 1900, a heating system that won't keep the water in the third
and fourth floors from freezing, and copper flashing that needs
replacing.''

<TEXT>
   As many as 300 lightning strikes were
recorded in Alaska's Interior since midnight, complicating efforts
to battle wildfires that have charred 1.25 million acres of timber
and tundra so far this month.
   ``The Weather Service says the thunderstorms won't bring much
rain,'' Trish Hogervorst-Rukke of the Fire Information Center in
Fairbanks, said today.
   Nearly all of the 129 fires raging in Alaska on Monday were
caused by lightning. The same conditions that create thunderstorms
bring erratic winds that cause problems to firefighting crews,
Hogervorst-Rukke said.
   ``It can send the fires back toward them,'' she said.
   The cost of fighting fires this season in Alaska has topped
$21.5 million, said R.J. Hayes, a spokesman for the Alaska
Interagency Fire Information Center in Fairbanks.
   That's up from about $15 million two weeks ago and dwarfs the
state's initial firefighting budget of about $3 million for the
season. And not all the fires are being fought.
   Dense smoke has hampered fire crews and cut visibility to less
than a mile, interrupting air and ground travel in parts of
Alaska's Interior.
   ``I haven't turned a prop yet today,'' said Walt Walton, owner
of an air-taxi service in the Kuskokwim River community of McGrath,
225 miles northwest of Anchorage. Visibility there Monday was
one-half mile, he said.
   Motorists on the Taylor Highway near the Alaska-Canada border
encountered periodic delays because of poor visibility.
   State highway officials advised motorists not to drive the
two-lane Dalton Highway north of Fairbanks. The 24,000-acre Hess
Creek fire was burning within two miles of the road that parallels
the trans-Alaska pipeline between Prudhoe Bay and the town of
Livengood.
   Officials said the pipeline, buried in the vicinity of the fire,
wasn't threatened.
   Health centers in some Interior communities reported treating
more people with scratchy throats and watery eyes caused by the
smoke.
   However, ``concentrations do not exceed ambient air quality
standards and probably won't,'' said Jack Coutts of the state
Department of Environmental Conservation in Fairbanks.
   The interruption of light-aircraft flights had repercussions in
some communities not served by roads. Mail delivery was interrupted
out of McGrath, and Walton was two days overdue picking up clients
he had flown to a remote hunting camp in the Alaska Range.
   No one has been injured in the fires and few dwellings have been
lost, officials said.

<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with deaths confirmed, nun among the

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge bomb exploded today on
the outskirts of the border city of Armagh, killing a Roman
Catholic nun and three policeman, police said.
   The murder of the nun was thought to be the first time a nun has
been killed in 21 years of sectarian violence in British-run
Northern Ireland.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but suspicion
immediately fell on the Irish Republican Army. The killing of a nun
would be seen widely as a grave embarrassment to the mainly
Catholic IRA.
   The bomb blew apart an unmarked police car, instantly killing
the three officers traveling in it, police sources said.
   The nun, who died later in hospital from severe injuries, was
traveling with a woman social worker in a separate car caught in
the blast, Jim Cantwell of the Catholic Press and Information
Office said.
   He said he could not identify the nun until her family had been
notified.
   Police and troops rushed reinforcements to the area near the
border with the Republic of Ireland. The area is considered prime
territory for operations by the outlawed IRA.
   The blast was the deadliest terrorist attack in the province
since an IRA bomb April 9 killed four soldiers of the locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment.
   Paul Corr, who owns a gas station near the Killylea Road where
the bomb exploded, said, ``the ground shook beneath us and it was
accompanied by a very large explosion.''
   ``We were first on the scene and saw a white Mini Metro with two
young lassies in their 20s in the car unconscious,'' Corr told
reporters.
   ``The ambulance then arrived and they managed to get them out.
It wasn't until then that we saw the police car on the opposite
side of the hedge buried in there.''
   The bomb, which blasted a crater in the two-lane road, was
apparently detonated by a timer device or by guerrillas lying in
wait, police sources said.
   Politicians and church leaders expressed outrage.
   ``This is one more example that when terrorists want to do
something they do it in an indiscriminate manner and it doesn't
matter what happens to others,'' said the Most Rev. Robin Eames,
the Anglican primate of Ireland.
   The blast occurred two miles outside Armagh, the ancient
religious capital of Ireland and seats of the heads of the Catholic
and Anglican churches throughout Ireland, north and south.
   Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of Northern Ireland's main Catholic
political party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, described
the attack as ``wanton and brutal savagery.''
   ``That is four more murders to add to the spiral of murders we
have had over this past 20 years,'' said Mallon. ``But it is not
just that. It is four more families bereaved, four more families
having this type of suffering heaped upon them.''
   Nearly 3,000 people have been killed since Protestant-Catholic
violence erupted in Northern Ireland in 1969 and the British
government sent in troops.
   The IRA is fighting a guerrilla campaign to end British rule and
unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland with the Republic of
Ireland under a leftist administration.

<HEAD>Malaysia to Track Turtles with U.S. Satellites</HEAD>

   Ten leatherback turtles will be
fitted with transmitters and tracked in international waters with
the help of NASA satellites, an official said.
   Fisheries Department Director General Shahrom Abdul Majid said
Monday the project would provide accurate information on the
movements of the giant leatherback turtles between their annual
nestings in Malaysia.
   Scientists say the species, which has been around for an
estimated 150 million years, is facing extinction due to pollution
and pilfering of their eggs, which are a delicacy in Malaysia.
   The turtles measure up to 5 feet in diameter, can weigh 900 lbs
and live for about 100 years.
   Majid said Malaysia will be the third country after French
Guiana and the United States to use this system, the national news
agency Bernama reported.
   He was speaking after launching the project at Rantau Abang, the
site of the turtles' annual nesting migration.
   The program involves using NASA satellites to relay signals
emitted by a platform transmitter terminal on the back of each
turtle to ground stations. The project cost $27,000.
   The turtles roam the seas around Japan, the Philippines and
Australia, but return annually to Rantau Abang, 180 miles northeast
of the capital of Kuala Lumpur, between June to August to lay their
eggs.
   In the 1950s between 1,700 and 2,000 of the turtles came ashore
annually, but their numbers dwindled to about 500 per year during
the past few years and to only about 60 last year, government
officials said.

   The Iraqi government accused Kuwait today
of conspiring against it with the United States. Diplomats said the
neighbors' tense confrontation has been aggravated by Iraq's
massing of troops on Kuwait's border.
   The border buildup began last week and coincided with a verbal
assault on Kuwait by Iraq's president, and threats of military
action.
   The Pentagon today announced that U.S. Navy ships are holding a
``short-notice exercise'' with forces of the United Arab Emirates
in the Persian Gulf area.
   Pete Williams, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in
Washington said he could provide no details on the exercise beyond
saying that it began Monday and that two Navy vessels left early
from their port at Bahrain in order to participate.
   Williams declined to comment on the purpose of the maneuvers or
say whether they were scheduled before Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of oil from
wells Iraqi territory and of trying to wreck the Iraqi economy by
conspiring by push down world oil prices.
   The oil in question comes from the Rumaila field, on land near
an unmarked part of the border that is claimed by both Kuwait and
Iraq.
   Diplomatic sources in Bahrain said the U.S. Navy was on alert.
They also said a Washington Post report of 30,000 Iraqi troops
massed at its southern border with Kuwait appeared to be correct.
   Williams would not comment on the Washington Post report, which
said the U.S. Navy had canceled shore leaves for its forces in the
Persian Gulf. The report quoted Western military attaches.
   White House spokesman Mrlin Fitzwater said of the situation
today, ``We're concerned about the troop buildup by Iraq and we ask
that all parties strive to avoid violence.''
   Diplomats in Iraq and Persian Gulf states said that soon after
Iraq-Kuwait dispute erupted, travelers saw battlefield missiles,
armored personel carriers and tanks prominently displayed along the
road from Iraq to Kuwait.
   Kuwait put its forces on alert for several days, but the
diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the alert was
canceled to defuse tension. Kuwait's entire armed forces has just
20,300 men.
   The United States has at least seven warships in the Persian
Gulf at any given moment. The State Department announced at the
beginning of the crisis that it backs Kuwait's territorial
integrity.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, some Kuwaiti tankers flew the American
flag as protection from attacks in the gulf.
   Baghdad kept up the verbal assaults on Kuwait today.
   The government newspaper Al-Joumhouriya accused Kuwait of
coordinating its moves with the United States in order to ``clear
the way for foreign powers to intervene in the area.''
   It also accused Kuwait of ignoring Arab solidarity by demanding
repayment of loans made to support Iraq during the Iran-Iraq war.
   ``The Kuwaiti government should have written off all the debts
at the moment Iraq asked it to do so,'' the paper said.
   Kuwait lent Iraq an estimated $15 billion during the war out of
a total $70 billion Iraq is believed to have borrowed.
   The attempts to repay the debt and rebuild the economy are
putting massive financial pressure on Iraq, which is trying to
rebuild following its 1980-88 war with Iran.
   Diplomats called the Iraqi moves brinksmanship, and did not
expect Iraq to invade Kuwait. But the reports sent jitters through
world financial markets.
   In Tokyo, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen today
over news of the increasing unrest, prompting traders to buy the
currency regarded as a safe haven.
   The dispute will overshadow a strategy meeting of ministers from
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which begins
Wednesday in Geneva.
   The Iraqi president last week threatened to use force if
necessary against countries pumping more oil than they OPEC quotas.
   Although Saddam did not mention names, he clearly was angry at
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. The two nations have
persistently ignored their OPEC prooduction limits, sending a flood
of crude onto the market and lowering oil prices.
   Saddam claimed Iraq had lost $14 billion in revenues in the past
year because of falling crude prices due to the oil glut.

   George Gross got more than a few
vegetables when he went gardening this week. He pulled up a
one-carrot diamond ring.
   The retired high school biology teacher was pulling carrots on
Monday when he found the ring, which he'd lost about a year ago. It
was buried in the ground with a carrot growing through it.
   Gross said the ring, a cluster of small diamonds, was a
Christmas gift from a friend, Ruby Ledford. Since losing it, he had
looked everywhere, not only hunting through his house but using a
metal detector to search his yard and garden.
   He said he found plenty of nuts, bolts and nails, but no ring.
   Ms. Ledford presented him with another ring, but Gross said he
missed the original gift ``because it was so special to me.''
   After finding the old ring, Gross said he asked Ms. Ledford if
he had to give one ring back.
   ``She couldn't believe that I found it,'' he said. ``She said I
could keep both rings.''

<TEXT>
   Pacific island leaders and environmental groups
are raising concerns about the Army's plan to store and destroy
chemical weapons at Johnston Atoll, 800 miles southwest of here.
   ``I think it's a very bad decision based on undue haste,'' Skip
Spaulding, an attorney for the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund in
Hawaii, said Monday. ``The Army seems more concerned with carrying
out its mission for its commander in chief than thoroughly
assessing the consequences.''
   ``The Pacific must not become the dumping ground for the world's
chemical agents and munitions,'' Hawaii Gov. John Waihee said last
week.
   The U.S. weapons from West Germany would add 100,000 rounds to
the 300,000 rounds of nerve and mustard gas stored at the remote
island since 1971.
   The transport of the munitions from West Germany will begin
Thursday and would continue through September, Pentagon spokesman
Pete Williams said Tuesday. Containers holding the weapons will be
loaded onto Navy ships for transport to the Pacific.
   The containers will be put in storage on Johnston Atoll until
the Army finishes testing an incinerator for the munitions. The
tests are to be completed late next year, and full-scale
destruction is not expected to begin until 1992.
   The Army said moving the weapons and destroying them at Johnston
Atoll would have minimal public health, safety and environmental
effects.
   ``Safety of people and nations and protection of the environment
is foremost in our minds,'' said John Fairbank, a spokesman for the
Army Western Command in Honolulu.
   ``The good part is we are in fact destroying a very unpopular
weapon,'' Fairbank said. ``The end result when we get through is
all of the weapons will be destroyed. We think the
environmentalists should cheer that goal.''
   There's been little cheering.
   ``Transporting the European stockpile halfway around the world
inescapably increases the risks,'' said a statement issued by the
Federated States of Micronesia, a former U.S. territory.
   Leaders of the Marshall Islands, Cook Islands, New Zealand and
the U.S. territory of American Samoa also have expressed
reservations about the plan.
   While most of the leaders have said they support destruction of
the weapons, they said they worry about the environmental dangers
of transporting the weapons across the Pacific and destroying them
at Johnston Atoll.
   The Pacific Council of Churches, representing 26 Protestant and
Roman Catholic churches in the South Pacific, asked the Army to
cancel the move. The Hawaii Legislature and Honolulu City Council
also have objected.
   Spaulding said the Sierra Club Legal Defense Club was planning
legal action to halt the shipment of the weapons until officials
have fully assessed the dangers.
   ``The problem with Johnston Atoll is this is an unproven
technology,'' Spaulding said. ``It hasn't been tested enough to
prove it's safe.''
   Fairbanks responded that the Army has tested the incineration
technology. ``This isn't something that we're just jumping off and
doing all of a sudden,'' he said.
   He agreed that the safest way to get rid of the weapons is to
destroy them in place. However, he said, ``We could not do that in
Germany because they are our munitions on foreign soil and we've
agreed to remove them.''
   Fairbank emphasized that the weapons at Johnston Atoll combined
with the weapons from West Germany represent about 6 percent of the
United States' chemical weapons. He said the Army has no plans to
use Johnston Atoll to destroy munitions from mainland storage sites.
   The $240 million disposal system was built to meet a 1985
congressional requirement to destroy all U.S. chemical weapons by
1997.
   The Army began testing the incinerator on June 30.

   President Bush said today ``the Supreme
Court must be guided by independent minds'' and there there should
be no ``litmus test'' in the Senate confirmation of nominee David
H. Souter.
   Bush, addressing a Pennsylvania state Republican fund-raising
luncheon, said, ``my sole priority was to appoint a justice true to
the life and the spirit of the Constitution, a priority that I'm
confident will also guide the Congress in the confirmation
process.''
   Without mentioning abortion or other divisive matters, Bush
said, ``there was no single issue, no litmus test on standards
dominating my decision to nominate.
   ``I would add, there should be no litmus test in the process of
confirmation,'' Bush said.
   The speech was Bush's first since his surprisingly quick
decision Monday to tap the little known federal appeals judge from
New Hampshire for the vacancy left by the retirement of 84-year-old
Justice William J. Brennan.
   Bush was also journeying to New York later for another GOP rally.
   ``The Supreme Court must be guided by independent minds and its
members are appointed for life largely to keep them above the
flames of political passion,'' Bush told 400 people at the GOP
luncheon.
   He called Souter ``a great man of enormous intelligence,
strength; a tough trial court judge with a great legal mind and an
impartial quality that will serve the court well.''
   Before leaving Washington, Bush huddled with the five top
Republican and Democratic leaders of Congress on the budget summit.
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said they agreed to cool
partisan rhetoric in an effort to forge an agreement to hold down
next year's estimated $169 billion deficit.
   But Bush still took a few swipes at what he called the Democrats
high-spending ways.
   ``All of us, Republicans and Democrats, deserve and should
demand real budget reform ... some discipline on the process,''
Bush said.
   ``The budget charade, these fiscal follies, must end,'' Bush
said.
   En route to Philadelphia, Fitzwater said Bush would be ``very
gentle'' toward Democrats in his campaign speeches.
   ``They're working in a spirit of harmony and compromise. In
fact, they agreed this morning at the meeting that they would try
to keep the rhetoric under control and really try to make this a
productive week of work,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush planned to meet with the congressional leaders every
morning this week while a larger, 21-member group of administration
and congressional officials grapples with the details each
afternoon.
   ``The president feels they made progress. It was a good
meeting,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``The large group is doing the heavy lifting in terms of going
through specific proposals and reaching conclusions about various
options,'' the spokesman said.
   ``Then the leadership group basically reviews the work done by
the large group and gives them any instructions they might have for
the next day's work,'' he said.
   Bush was campaigning in Philadelphia for Barbara Hafer, a
pro-choice Republican trying to oust Democratic Gov. Robert Casey,
who is anti-abortion.
   After a stop at an anti-drug rally in a west Philadelphia
community center, Bush was bound for Manhattan to raise funds for
Pierre Renfret, an economist and political novice seeking to defeat
Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   After attending an anti-drug rally in a West Philadelphia
community center, Bush was bound for Manhattan and a GOP dinner to
help the New York gubernatorial campaign of Pierre Renfret, an
economist and political novice trying to oust Democratic Gov. Mario
Cuomo.
   Fitzwater said the president would devote the speech at the
Philadelphia fund-raiser to ``the differences between the two
parties and the need for fiscal discipline.''
   Bush sounded the same themes in a Western swing last week in
which he blamed Democrats for the spiraling deficit and
``government by gridlock.''

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Answer U.S. Move With Appeal for World Support</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas,
stung by a U.S. move to isolate the group, on Tuesday appealed for
world support to help end Cambodia's civil war.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan, in a statement over Khmer
Rouge army radio, said the guerrillas must have a role in any peace
settlement.
   It was the group's first reaction to the U.S. decision to
withdraw its recognition of the U.N. seat held by the guerrilla
coalition. The United States, citing its opposition to the Khmer
Rouge, said last Wednesday it will instead open talks with Vietnam
on ending the Cambodian war.
   Vietnam ousted the Communist Khmer Rouge from power in late
1978. The Khmer Rouge is now joined in a resistance coalition with
the non-Communist forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and with Son
Sann's Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   Together they are fighting the government installed by Vietnam.
The U.S. move was prompted by reports of strong military gains by
the Khmer Rouge, who killed hundreds of thousands of people during
their 1975-78 rule of Cambodia.
   Khieu Samphan noted the support given to the resistance by other
countries, including the six-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations.
   ``The Cambodian people also ask them to continue providing
steadfast assistance and support until the Vietnamese war of
aggression against Cambodia is comprehensively settled in
conformity with the spirit and principle of the U.N. charter,'' he
said.
   ASEAN comprises Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, the
Philippines and Brunei. ASEAN foreign ministers, in Indonesia for
an annual consultations, said Monday that attempts to change
Cambodia's U.N. seat at this time ``would set back the search for a
comprehensive political solution.''
   China, the main arms supplier for the resistance and
particularly the Khmer Rouge, has said it will continue its backing
despite the U.S. policy shift.
   But China agrees with other members of the U.N. Security Council
that there should be a U.N.-monitored halt to all outside arms
supplies once a political solution is reached, the U.S. assistant
secretary of state for Asian affairs, Richard Solomon, said in
Washington late Monday.
   In the radio broadcast, Khieu Samphan said that ``only with the
participation of all four parties can there be genuine national
reconciliation and can we correctly implement international law and
the U.N. charter, which says that the people of each country have
the right to decide their own destiny.''
   He noted the vast majority of the U.N. members supported the
guerrilla coalition's seat. ``The position is to ensure that the
U.N. charter and international law prevail over the law of the
jungle and the use of force,'' he said.
   Vietnam said it withdrew the last of its soldiers from Cambodia
in late September. Before elections for a new government are held,
the Khmer Rouge wants an interim coalition representing each of the
warring parties installed.
   The Cambodian government wants the interim power and says any
settlement must include measures to prevent a Khmer Rouge return to
power.
   Many Cambodians hate and fear the Khmer Rouge. But many citizens
give the guerrillas food and other aid during operations deep in
the country.
   Khieu Samphan said the guerrillas' battlefield victories have
``proved (they) ... have been supported by the people.''

   Christopher Michael Duda, one of the nation's
first test-tube twins, has died at age 7 of complications from a
congenital heart defect.
   Christopher died Sunday at Children's Memorial Hospital.
   The boy's father, Robert Duda, 40, of Chicago, said he was
grateful for the time Christopher spent with him, his 37-year-old
wife, Patricia, and the boy's twin sister, Danielle.
   ``I don't know what his mission in life was other than to make
me happy,'' said Duda, who manages a car dealership.
   Christopher had entered the hospital a month ago for surgery to
correct the defect that was resulting in low levels of oxygen in
his blood. He had undergone a series of related operations since
shortly after his birth.
   Christopher and Danielle were born May 14, 1983, at Evanston
Hospital and were believed to be the nation's second set of
test-tube twins.
   Doctors have said the birth defect was not related to the method
of conception.
   Services are scheduled for Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A ruling that a county's voting districts
should be redrawn to increase black voting strength was overturned
by a federal appeals court panel Tuesday because the lawsuit was
filed too late.
   The ruling was a setback for the American Civil Liberties Union,
which has sought redistricting to increase black voter strength in
about 18 Virginia localities.
   The plaintiffs, black voters in Brunswick County in southern
Virginia, probably will appeal, their lawyer said. ``We're
incredibly disappointed and we think the decision was very
inappropriate,'' said the attorney, Gerald T. Zerkin.
   The ruling by a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals overturned an order by U.S. District Judge James R.
Spencer that the county's voting districts be redrawn.
   The plaintiffs' delay in challenging a 1971 redistricting ``was
inexcusable and unreasonable,'' said the opinion by Judge Robert F.
Chapman.
   The appellate panel also said it would make no sense to change
the county's voting districts just before 1990 census figures
become available.
   ``A court-ordered reapportionment at this date would be
completely gratuitous, because there are no elections scheduled
before November 1991 and the 1990 census figures may require
reapportionment,'' Chapman said in the ruling joined by Judges
James M. Sprouse and William W. Wilkins Jr.
   If the plaintiffs believe the 1991 redistricting violates the
U.S. Voting Rights Act, they can file another lawsuit, the judges
said.
   Until Tuesday's ruling, the ACLU has won out-of-court
settlements or court rulings that were not appealed in nearly all
the redistricting cases it pursued in Virginia, said Kent Willis,
director of the state ACLU chapter. A case against Henrico County
is pending before the 4th Circuit.
   Brunswick County, which is 57 percent black, has a five-member
board of supervisors elected from single-member districts. Four of
the districts have populations that are more than half black, but
only two have elected black supervisors.
   The board created the districts after the 1970 census and left
them intact after the 1980 census.
   ``The plaintiffs voiced no objection either to the 1971
redistricting or to the 1981 decision not to redistrict and waited
until September 1988 to file this action,'' the appeals panel said.
   The judges rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the delay
gave them information from several elections on which to base their
claim that blacks are discriminated against in the county.
   ``The plaintiffs, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, could
have discovered at a much earlier time the facts upon which they
now base their claim,'' the opinion said.
   Zerkin protested: ``We relied on the analysis of voting records
that included elections in 1987. If we had brought it earlier the
first thing they would have said is, `You have insufficent data.' ''
   Zerkin also said the rural county has gained so few people that
the 1990 redistricting is unlikely to produce major changes.
   ``The net effect of this decision is that we have to start all
over again,'' he said.
   Raymond S. Daniel, vice chairman of the Brunswick County Board
of Supervisors, said he was ``pleased the ruling was in favor of
Brunswick County.'' Daniel said he had not seen the ruling and did
not want to comment further.

   Environmentalists won a court order
temporarily barring Louisiana-Pacific Corp. from logging an
old-growth forest that has been a target of ``Redwood Summer''
protesters.
   Seventeen other protesters were arrested Tuesday in protests
further north, near Eureka.
   The order, issued Monday by Mendocino County Superior Court
Judge James Luther, appeared to be the first under new state
emegency regulations that bar logging that threatens the northern
spotted owl.
   ``There's obviously going to be some precedent set here,'' said
Louisiana-Pacific spokesman Shep Tucker.
   As part of the Redwood Summer campaign, environmentalists have
targeted the 110-acre Louisiana-Pacific logging operation in the
Navarro Ridge area, 10 miles south of the coastal village of
Mendocino. Nearly 40 people were arrested there last week on
trespassing charges.
   Further north in Humboldt County, protesters with the
environmental group Earth First! chained themselves to gates at two
Pacific Lumber Co. sites, one 10 miles south of Eureka and one 30
miles southeast of the city, sheriff's Sgt. Forrest Schafer said
Tuesday.
   The 17 were arrested for investigation of trespassing. One
person had to be cut from the gates, Schafer said. Three of those
who chained themselves were juveniles, Schafer said.
   The protesters, who assembled before dawn in hopes of blocking
logging traffic, are trying to save the Salmon Creek headwaters
area on Pacific Lumber Co. land, which they say is the largest
intact old-growth redwood watershed left.

<TEXT>
   Creating jobs in Mexico and other countries is
the only long-term way to cut illegal immigration into the United
States, a special commission told Congress on Tuesday.
   Diego C. Asencio, a former U.S. assistant secretary of State,
headed the 12-member Commission for the Study of International
Migration and Cooperative Economic Development, established by
Congress in 1986.
   Asencio told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that,
initially, economic development encourages people to leave a
country. But he added:
   ``Promoting economic development is the proper way to proceed if
we are serious about stemming unauthorized migration in this
hemisphere over the long term, and I must emphasize that we are
talking about a process that will probably take decades.''
   The commission recommended creating an Agency for Migration
Affairs to take charge of refugees and immigrants.
   ``As a young vice-consul, I could never understand why one
agency should allow immigrants to come in and another decide if
that was all right,'' Asencio said.
   Consuls, who work for the State Department, issue visas in other
countries for entry into the United States. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service of the Justice Department has authority over
immigrants after they arrive, including the authority to issue
green cards, which give the immigrants the right to work.
   Asencio said the first reaction he had from the State Department
was unfavorable to his proposed new agency.
   ``Some people would lose their jobs and they don't like that,''
he explained.
   The commission said any major decision on aid and trade for
other countries should have with it an ``impact statement'' to show
the effect of the decision on immigration.
   The commission also recommended:
   _Speeding creation of a free trade area with Mexico and bringing
it into the free trade area with Canada.
   _Supporting freer trade with other Western Hemisphere countries
but leaving the initiative to them.
   _Gradually letting Mexico and Caribbean countries make and ship
here the cloth, clothes and steel now coming from Asia.
   _Increasing sugar imports from the Caribbean.
   _Linking trade benefits to rights of workers in the exporting
country, particularly rights in the ``maquiladora'' plants along
Mexico's border that process goods for this country.
   _Working with Mexico to improve the quality of life in border
areas.

<HEAD>Gingrich Will Seek Censure of Barney Frank</HEAD>

   House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich said today he
supports the censure of Rep. Barney Frank, rather than the less
severe reprimand recommended by the ethics committtee to punish the
Massachusetts Democrat for using his office to help a male
prostitute.
   Gingrich made clear he was not speaking for the House GOP
leadership. But his position as the second-ranking House Republican
could influence lawmakers wavering between a censure and the ethics
committee's recommendation of a lesser punishment _ a reprimand.
   The Georgia Republican said one consequence of a censure would
be Frank's automatic loss of his chairmanship of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental
relations.
   Gingrich told a news conference his support for a censure had
nothing to do with Frank's admittedly gay lifestyle. Rather, he
said, censure is appropriate because Frank wrote a misleading
letter to a probation officer that was favorable to the prostitute
_ who was convicted on drug and sex charges.
   ``Censure is the minimum appropriate action,'' he said, because
lying to or misleading a court official ``is clearly a standard
Congress cannot accept.''
   Gingrich said, however, he would not back a move to expel Frank.
The case is to reach the House floor Thursday.
   On the other hand, Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, ranking
Republican on the ethics panel, said he will urge House members to
uphold the committee position for reprimanding Frank, an
acknowledged homosexual.
   The Republican leadership planned to discuss the party's
strategy at its regular meeting this afternoon. House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the Frank case would be considered
on the floor Thursday.
   Republicans could only hope to override the committee decision
with the support of conservative Democrats, who will be urged by
their own leadership to back the 12-0 recommendation last Thursday
by the ethics committee.
   A key to the seriousness of the conservative GOP effort will be
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who is the leader
of the right wing ranks. He has yet to announce his position.
   A reprimand would involve the House voting to approve the report
of the ethics panel.
   A censure would involve a similar vote, along with the
requirement that the member face his colleagues while the action is
approved.
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif. already has announced he
would introduce a resolution to expel Frank. The expulsion
resolution must pass by a two-thirds majority and even conservative
Republicans gave Dannemeyer no chance of success.
   Myers would not predict whether a censure resolution would pass,
but said, ``It sure would get more voters than expulsion.''
   He said the reprimand proposal ``wasn't an easy decision to come
to. This is the compromise we worked out.''
   Frank, a liberal serving his fifth term, is expected to be on
the floor regardless of the punishment, because he has promised to
apologize to the House.
   ``I believe the committee position will be sustained on the
floor,'' Foley told reporters Monday. Majority Whip William H. Gray
III, D-Pa., concurred, saying, ``Attempts at censure or expulsion
will fail.''
   The ethics committee concluded in a report released Friday that
Frank brought discredit upon the ouse in two areas of his conduct
with male prostitute Stephen L. Gobie.
   The panel found he used his congressional status for dismissal
of 33 parking tickets incurred by Gobie while not on official
business. Frank said he had employed Gobie as a personal aide from
1985-87 and paid him with personal funds.
   The panel recommended that Frank make restitution of an
unspecified amount to the District of Columbia for the tickets.
   The committee also said Frank also wrote a memo that wound up in
the files of a Virginia prosecutor, which made misleading
statements favorable to Gobie during his probation. Gobie had been
convicted on drug and sex charges.
   Rep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., said he's aware that some GOP
members are considering a censure of Frank and added he would vote
for such a proposal.
   Walker said a key factor for those favoring censure would be
Frank's initial failure to pay Social Security taxes on Gobie's
salary. He called the issue ``a serious question that merits a
penalty greater than the ethics committee's recommendation.''

<HEAD>Senators Propose $7 Billion Defense Conversion Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laid off defense workers would be guaranteed
health benefits and part of their income for a year under a $7
billion bill proposed Tuesday by Connecticut's two senators.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., called his proposal the most
comprehensive of several measures already under consideration in
Congress this year. The legislation, cosponsored by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., would guarantee laid off workers a basic
level of income, help companies shift to non-military production,
and provide aid to affected communities.
   ``The changing nature of foreign threats will dictate some
reduction in defense spending,'' Lieberman said during a news
conference. ``But we must not embark on wholesale cuts in defense
programs that destroy important parts of our economy and jeopardize
our national security.''
   He said defense workers are ``veterans of the Cold War'' whose
efforts helped lead to peace between the superpowers.
   The lawmakers said the bill could affect millions nationwide who
hold defense industry jobs.
   ``This thing reaches from the Bath Iron Works in Maine to San
Diego and very few places in between are left untouched,'' Dodd
said.
   The proposal would use up to 10 percent of the so-called peace
dividend _ money saved through defense spending reductions _ in
each of the next seven years met with widespread publicity, seemingly out
of proportion to their impact on the traveling public, and American
spokesman Tim Smith said, ``I think because of that coverage, the
impact on competition of these surcharges would have gone beyond
the dollar amount of these costs.''
   American had estimated the higher fees at the airports would add
$4 million a year to expenses.
   Although the carrier earned $730 million last year, Smith said,
``$4 million is still a lot of money when you feel that it is
unfair.''
   ``The bottom line was not an impact on this,'' he said. ``It was
an attempt to take action against something that was unfair in our
mind.''
   However, no other carrier had moved to match the surcharges, and
Smith said, ``We cannot ignore competition. You can't sacrifice
competitive advantage for an idea that's not working or might not
work.''
   The reversal was the second time this year American has failed
in an attempt to influence fares.
   In March, American announced plans to implement a mileage-based
fare system, but ditched the plans after no other carriers followed
suit.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Reduction In Military Aid To Afghanistan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee has voted to
slash aid for the Afghan rebels, reflecting growing congressional
disenchantment with proxy wars around the world, officials said
Tuesday.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a member of the panel, said the
main rationale for the move was that the United States had achieved
its purpose in Afghanistan when Soviet troops withdrew in February
1989.
   Some senators also were concerned about reports that the rebels
_ known as the Mujahedeen _ were overlooking narcotics trafficking
in the region, Murkowski said.
   Several conservatives, along with a State Department official,
said they hoped money would be restored to higher levels before
work is finished on the bill that includes 1991 money for covert
actions around the world.
   ``The level of appropriation is not yet decided,'' said Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., a staunch supporter of the rebels. ``There
are many steps in the process and those that are concerned have
high hopes'' for full funding, he said.
   Murkowski said he wasn't present at the Intelligence Committee
meeting when members voted to cut secret aid for the Afghan rebels
in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. But he said the vote on the
Democrat-controlled panel was not close.
   Murkowski _ along with several other senators _ refused to
discuss dollar amounts. But a congressional source, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said he understood the panel reduced
funding for the rebels by about $100 million. Last fall, Congress
reportedly appropriated roughly $300 million for the rebels for
fiscal 1990.
   Despite the withdrawal of Soviet troops, fighting has continued
between the Moscow-backed government of Afghan President Najibullah
and the U.S.-backed rebels for control of the mountainous country.
   U.S.-Soviet negotiations are underway in an effort to set up
internationally supervised elections. Meantime, a State Department
official said Moscow spends roughly $300 million a month to
maintain the Najibullah government, sending in food, fuel and
advanced weapons such as Scud missiles.
   ``What Congress appropriates has been less than 10 percent as to
what the Soviets do,'' one official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The Senate panel's action comes at a time many members of
Congress are questioning continued funding for U.S.-financed
guerrilla wars in Afghanistan, Cambodia and Angola. Those questions
have been prompted by the easing of East-West tensions as well as a
shrinking defense budget.
   The Senate intelligence panel also voted on June 28 to eliminate
a $13 million covert military aid program for the rebels opposing
the Soviet-backed government of Cambodia.
   Some lawmakers also have criticized aid to guerrilla fighters in
Angola, where efforts are under way to reach a peace between the
Marxist-backed government and rebels headed by Jonas Savimbi.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., chairman of the
House intelligence committee, said the panel has postponed
consideration of the 1991 covert action budget until after
Congress' August recess.
   The panel was under no time pressure to finish the budget, he
said, adding that in the next six or seven weeks ``maybe
negotiations will work'' in hot spots around the world.
   Beilenson said there was some sentiment on the panel to close
down U.S.-financed wars in some cases.
   On a more general note, Beilenson said he generally favors more
open discussion of U.S. military aid programs.

   The season's first named storm,
Tropical Storm Arthur, swirled to life Tuesday in the Caribbean,
east of Trinidad.
   The government of the nation of Trinidad and Tobago issued storm
warnings for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada and Grenada dependencies.
The islands separate the southeastern Caribbean Sea from the
Atlantic.
   At 2:30 p.m. EDT, Arthur's top sustained winds of 40 mph _ just
1 mph above the speed required for named-storm status _ were
centered near latitude 10.7 north and longitude 58.5 west, or about
160 miles east of Trinidad. It was moving west at about 20 mph and
was expected to continue that motion through the day, said Hal
Gerrish of the National Hurricane Center.
   Some additional strengthening was likely by mid-afternoon
Wednesday, Gerrish said. Three to 5 inches or rain and local
flash-flooding were expected to accompany the storm across the
islands.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes is their sustained winds top
74 mph.
   Arthur grew from a depression, the second of the 1990 season,
that formed Sunday in the open Atlantic. The Atlantic season runs
from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Servers Paying Taxes on Just One-Third of Tip Income, IRS Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The average U.S. restaurant tip is just under
12 percent and food-servers are dodging taxes on as much as
two-thirds of it, the Internal Revenue Service said Tuesday.
   Employees of restaurants with 10 or fewer workers are reporting
only $1 of every $3 received in tips, Marshall Washburn, deputy
assistant IRS commissioner, told the House Ways and Means Social
Security subcommittee. Waiters in larger restaurants are reporting
half their tips, he said.
   Those figures are up significantly from 1982, when the
disclosure that only 16 percent of tips were reported to tax
collectors prompted Congress to toughen the law on tips.
   Under the new law, Washburn said, voluntarily reported tips rose
by $1.6 billion in 1984 alone. Federal tax collections on tip
income rose by more than $1 billion in the three years ending in
1986.
   The 1982 law requires tipped employees of larger restaurants to
prove it if they claim to have received tips averaging less than 8
percent. Employees are also required to report tip income to their
employers, and the employers to pass that information on to the IRS.
   The subject of Tuesday's hearing was an effort by the restaurant
industry to repeal a newer law, which requires employers to pay
Social Security taxes on all an employee's tips, up to $51,300 a
year. The employee pays a matching amount.
   Before the law was changed in 1987, the employer paid Social
Security taxes only on an amount equal to the minimum wage, which
today would be $7,904.
   Rob Haimson, a Greeley, Colo., restaurateur speaking for the
National Restaurant Association, said the 1987 law should be
changed because it penalizes businesses as well as employees, is
difficult to enforce and is not needed by the Social Security
system.
   ``The Social Security tax is a payroll tax which is intended to
be based upon wages paid by an employer,'' said Roger Branigan, who
operates a restaurant in Indianapolis. ``Tips are not wages.''
   Changing the 1987 law would require that either workers or the
Social Security system pay most of an employer's share of Social
Security tax. Those options were opposed, respectively, by the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union and by the American
Association of Retired Persons.

<HEAD>Loyalists Repel Rebel Attack; Insurgents Fire at Doe Mansion</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: This report is based in part on a pool dispatch
filed by journalists in Monrovia, including AP correspondent
Michael Goldsmith.
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers loyal to the president fought
off rebels and appeared in control of the city Tuesday after an
ambush on the capital. Insurgents launched another attack from the
sea.
   A spokesman for President Samuel Doe said the seaborne attack
appeared to have been launched by a U.S. submarine. The State
Department denied the allegation.
   A presidential spokesman, Selly Thompson, also told the British
Broadcasting Corp. in London that government troops were advancing
against rebels in Monrovia.
   Followers of rebel leader Prince Johnson penetrated the city
center Monday after wading through swampland and evading troops
guarding bridges into town. Followers of Charles Taylor, a rival
rebel commander, were blocked by government troops in the city's
eastern suburbs. Taylor said he had infiltrated some men into the
capital, but only in small numbers.
   Taylor and Johnson split sometime in the past three months, and
some foreign diplomats have said Johnson's group is now stronger
than Taylor's.
   Witnesses said an unidentified vessel approached the coastline
in the darkness and fired at least six rounds at Doe's mansion. Doe
was believed to be inside the compound.
   Troops inside returned fire, and the booming of cannon shots
echoed through the city. After the boat sped away, one shot from
the mansion was seen to fall harmlessly into the sea, a few hundred
yards offshore.
   The damage to the heavily fortified mansion could not be
immediately determined. Reporters who tried to go there or to the
nearby ministry of information were turned back by soldiers.
   Later, Thompson read a statement to the BBC saying ``the mansion
had been the target of a missile attack from the sea by what seemed
to be a United States submarine.''
   The African nation, founded by freed American slaves 150 years
ago, has traditionally had close ties with Washington. But
Washington has refused to send in a peacekeeping force, and on
Saturday Doe ordered the American military attache expelled,
accusing him of helping the rebels.
   The United States denied the accusations. It has offered to
provide safe conduct out of the country for Doe.
   In Washington, the State Department flatly denied it had fired
on Doe's compound.
   It was not known how many soldiers were still fighting on the
government side, other than the 500 members of Doe's presidential
guard. Some government forces remained in pockets outside the
capital but were unable to offer much help against the rebels, who
have advanced steadily since launching their siege in December.
   Government forces between Taylor's men and the capital included
the 72nd Infantry Battalion and units based at Schiefflin Army
Base. The infantry battalion was said to be putting up stiff
resistance. Units at the army base had ventured out on several
occasions to retake ground held by rebels, according to reports
from the rebel side.
   Troops loyal to Doe patrolled Monrovia's streets. Shops were
closed. Civilians, searching in vain for food, were harassed by
soldiers nervous after the surprise attack Monday by followers of
Prince Johnson.
   Little is known about Johnson. He apparently served in the
Liberian armed forces and was a supporter of Brig. Gen Thomas
Quiwonkpa, who launched a 1985 coup attempt against Doe. Johnson
joined up with Taylor last year and was a lieutenant in the rebel
National Patriotic Liberation Front.
   ``He's posing a much more formidable challenge than we
thought,'' one U.S. official said of Johnson.
   There have been conflicting reports on whether Johnson and
Taylor have reconciled.
   The rebels have accused Doe, who took power of the nation of 2.4
million people in a 1980 coup, of corruption, mismanagement and
human rights abuses. At least nine male bodies, most of them
stripped, were found on a beach not far from the city's embassy
district Tuesday. Other bodies were scattered nearby. Witnesses
told a photographer that soldiers had brought the people there
during the night and summarily executed them.
   Doe's troops, fearful the rebels will kill former soldiers if
they take the capital, have frequently been seen shooting
civilians. The civilians usually belong to the Gio or Mano tribes,
which provide the main support for Taylor.
   Taylor's soldiers have similarly executed troops belonging to
Doe's Krahn tribe.
   Doe has been deserted by nearly all senior members of his
government but had not asked the United States for help, a U.S.
official in Washington said Monday.
   Doe has said he will not leave the besieged capital until the
civil war has been decided. Sources said his presidential guard
would not let him leave unless they were provided safe passage to
their home territory in Grand Gedeh County.

<TEXT>
   A senior Cuban official on Tuesday blamed exile
radio stations in Miami for stirring up the Cubans who have sought
asylum in foreign embassies over the past two weeks.
   The vice foreign minister, Jose R. Viera, demanded the
``unconditional and voluntary'' departure of the 25 Cubans now
being sheltered at three European embassies.
   On Sunday, three Cubans entered the Swiss Embassy. Earlier, 18
had sought refuge at the Spanish Embassy and four at the Italian
Embassy.
   Viera said it is ``not admissible'' for a Cuban desiring to
emigrate to circumvent normal procedures by forcing his way into a
foreign embassy.
   If Cuba acquiesced in this practice, ``the embassies in Cuba
would not be able to function'' and embassies throughout the Third
World might be overrun by people wishing to emigrate, Viera said.
   At several points during his hourlong talk, Viera blamed exile
radio stations in Miami for inciting the incidents at the
embassies. The first incident occurred at the Czechoslovak Embassy
on July 9.
   Cuban reports said at least three of the exile radio stations
can often be heard clearly in Havana but the Cuban reports were
unable to substantiate Viera's claims that they have been been
encouraging Cubans to seek refuge.
   The reporters said one of the stations is operated by the
Cuban-American National Foundation. Another is run by a group
called Cuba Independent and Democratic, they said.
   Viera sought to portray the incidents at the embassies as
unrepresentative of the overall situation here.
   He said the annual carnival celebration this week has been
proceeding normally. The events at the embassies have led to a
substantial increase in security around many diplomatic missions of
NATO countries.
   The highlight of the carnival celebration is a speech Thursday
by President Fidel Castro commemorating the 37th anniversary of his
debut as a rebel fighter. Castro took power in Cuba in 1959.
   The incident at the Spanish Embassy has led to a deterioration
in Cuba's relations with Madrid.
   While Cuba has called the asylum-seekers ``scum'' and habitual
vagrants and said it will never allow them to leave the island,
Spain has said it will not expel the Cubans and will try instead to
negotiate their departure.
   Last week, reflecting escalating tensions between the two
countries, Spain suspended a $2.5 million aid program to Cuba,
recalled its ambassador and sent four guards to bolster security at
its embassy in Havana.
   Spain's foreign minister, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, had said
Castro is afraid his hard-line Communist government will fall like
those in Eastern Europe if he allows Cubans to leave. Fernandez
Ordonez also urged a transition to democracy in Cuba.
   The wave of embassy break-ins began two weeks ago, not long
after similar incidents were occurring at foreign embassies in
Albania. Albania, like Cuba, is a hard-line Communist state.

<HEAD>Jurist's Record Offers Little Insight on Vexing Social Issues</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The extensive paper trail of David H. Souter's
New Hampshire Supreme Court tenure shows he is a clear,
dispassionate writer of legal opinions. But it offers scant insight
into his views on the vexing social issues he'd face as a member of
the nation's highest court.
   President Bush's choice for the Supreme Court spent seven years
as a member of the New Hampshire high court _ a period in which he
wrote nearly 200 opinions and cast votes in hundreds of other cases.
   But his views on such issues as abortion, civil rights and
church-state relations are largely or completely unknown.
   A review of many of his decisions reveals Souter is most
assuredly a judicial conservative _ a judge who believes in
sticking to the case at hand and shies away from making sweeping
statements about the law.
   He often sides with positions advanced by state government
officials, especially in criminal cases. But there have been
notable exceptions.
   In a 1988 decision, Souter led the state court in declaring
unconstitutional a state law that barred a non-profit group from
providing legal services to some disabled people.
   The New Hampshire Disabilities Rights Center (DRC), authorized
by state law to provide such services to the poor, sought
permission to represent some disabled clients who were not poor.
   ``The DRC's request runs counter to the applicable state
statutes,'' Souter said. ``Despite this conflict, we hold that
enforcement of state law to prohibit the DRC, as a non-profit
corporation, from representing non-indigent clients in its advocacy
in behalf of disabled people would violate the First and 14th
Amendments of the National Constitution.''
   He added, ``Organizations, their members and their staff lawyers
may assert a protected First Amendment right of association for
non-commercial purposes to advocate the enforcement of legal and
constitutional rights of those members, or of others within a
definite class whom the organization exists to serve.''
   In upholding the dismissal of a Somersworth, N.H., police chief,
Souter said in a 1989 decision, ``The trial court really had little
choice but to find that the (chief's) infidelity in finance and
ineptitude in administration had rendered him incapable of holding
a position demanding honor and integrity of its incumbent.''
   In a ruling earlier that year, Souter said a bank could not be
held contractually liable for failing to discover poor workmanship
on a construction project for which it had tendered loans to Ross
and Virginia Seymour.
   ``The Seymours' responsibility for workmanship could not escape
any reasonable reader of these documents,'' he said. ``The Seymours
make a further try at salvaging the contract claim by ... pointing
to a loan officer's alleged remark that the bank's inspections
would be a `safeguard and well worth it.' They conveniently forget,
however, that they never asked the trial court for a specific
finding that the remark was made.''
   In a 1988 decision criticized by women's rights groups, Souter
ordered a new trial for a man who had been convicted of sexual
assault because his lawyers had been prevented from offering
evidence of the complaining woman's public behavior with other men.
   Souter said such evidence was essential to the man's defense
that the woman had consented to having sex with him.
   In a 1987 sexual assault case, Souter upheld a prosecutor's
closing argument comment that the defendant's lawyer had failed to
prove the victim was ``promiscuous.''
   ``The comment can reasonably be interpreted as nothing more than
a response to defense counsel's attempts, in cross-examination and
closing argument, to present the victim as a woman of small virtue
seeking a stranger for sexual amusement,'' Souter wrote.
   In one of the rare civil rights cases in which he participated,
Souter joined the state court's ruling in 1987 that said
homosexuals may be barred from becoming adoptive or foster parents.
But the state court ruling also said that homosexuals may not be
barred from running day care centers.
   In a 1986 case, Souter joined the majority in ruling that
doctors have a responsibility to test for birth defects and inform
pregnant women of the option of abortion.
   In a concurring opinion, Souter questioned the impact the
decision would have on doctors who oppose abortion on moral
grounds. He said such physicians should not have to choose
``between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures.''
   Souter was the lone dissenter in a 1985 state Supreme Court
decision that struck down the use of police sobriety checkpoints.
The nation's highest court upheld such police tactics earlier this
year.
   As New Hampshire's attorney general in 1978, Souter defended
Gov. Meldrim Thomson's plan to fly flags at half-staff from all
public buildings on Good Friday to commemorate the death of Jesus
Christ.
   Souter said the governor's proclamation sought to recognize
Jesus as a historical figure without endorsing Christianity. But as
the state's chief lawyer, Souter was obligated to represent the
governor in court, and he never was confronted with a similar
church-state issue while on the bench.

<HEAD>Government Acts to End Annual Row Over Royal Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to end yearly budget-time rows over
the royal allowance, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday
the royal family will receive a fixed annual increase for the next
decade.
   Such an arrangement was used for about 200 years before 1975.
Then, the government began granting the royal allotment on an
annual basis as part of the national budget.
   The Civil List, as the payment is known, will rise at about 7.5
percent per year for the next decade, Mrs. Thatcher said.
   She said the royal family is ``a focus of patriotism, loyalty,
affection and esteem. It is a rare combination and we should value
it.''
   Behind her move was the wish to avoid the annual budget-day
``pay rise'' announcement, which both politicians and the royal
family found unseemly. Anti-monarchists used the budget
announcement as a chance to attack the expense of maintaining the
royals.
   Under the 1990 budget, the royal allowance totalled about $12.1
million. Queen Elizabeth II received the lion's share at $9.26
million.
   The Civil List officially repays the monarch and 10 other
members of her family for official duties. About 70 percent of the
money goes to salaries and employment costs for royal staff.
   The queen has 250 permanent full-time employees, including those
in her private office, the Buckingham Palace press office staff and
those responsible for ceremonial duties.
   Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, is not on the Civil
List. He receives undisclosed income from royal estates.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock applauded the new
arrangement and said it would ``provide for greater continuity and
more effective planning in the financing of the royal household.''
   Meanwhile, the queen has recruited a leading London accountant
to help run her households more efficiently.
   Michael Peat, 40, a partner in the accounting firm of Peat
Marwick McLintock, was named the royal household's director of
finance and property services. He will oversee the management of
Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, St. James Palace and Kensington
Palace.

<HEAD>`Brady' Handgun Bill Clears House Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Judiciary Committee approved on
Tuesday a seven-day waiting period for handgun purchases, brushing
aside opposition from the National Rifle Association.
   Rep. Edward F. Feighan, D-Ohio, the bill's sponsor, hailed the
committee approval on a 27-9 vote as ``a great victory in the war
against crime.''
   The measure's sponsors say it is designed to give police time to
check the backgrounds of would-be purchasers. It is known as the
Brady bill in honor of former White House press secretary Jim
Brady, who was shot in the 1981 attack on then-President Reagan and
has lobbied in favor of it.
   In the Senate, a similar bill has been introduced by Sen. Howard
M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   The House Judiciary Committee on Monday approved an omnibus
crime bill that would increase from five to 10 years in prison the
maximum penalty for use of a sawed-off shotgun or rifle in a drug
crime and establish a 30-year sentence for using a bomb or hand
grenade.
   Earlier, the committee approved legislation to curb
semiautomatic assault weapons. It would ban an estimated 12 guns
made in the United States.
   The Senate-passed version of omnibus crime legislation would ban
the import or domestic manufacture of nine semiautomatic assault
weapons.
   It was unclear when the House would have a floor vote on the
waiting-period bill, although supporters were hoping for one before
lawmakers leave Washington on their August recess.
   Before approving its handgun bill, the House committee defeated
on a 24-12 vote a substitute proposed by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.
It would have required states to upgrade their law enforcement
computer systems to allow for point-of-purchase telephone
identification of felons attempting to buy guns.
   It also would have required states to put fingerprints on
drivers licenses within five years or risk losing federal funds.
   McCollum argues that the measure would work too much of a
hardship on honest gun purchasers and that his plan would strike
more directly at criminals.

<HEAD>Art Expert Gerald Hedley Dies in Avalanche</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerald Hedley, described by London's National
Gallery as one of the world's top experts in art restoration, has
been killed in a mountaineering accident in the French Alps. He was
41.
   The gallery said Tuesday that Hedley fell about 200 feet down a
rockface to his death after being caught in an avalanche Saturday
on Tour Ronde mountain.
   His guide, Dave Cuthbertson, survived with a broken leg, wrist
and ribs when his rope snagged on an outcrop.
   David Bomford, senior restorer at the National Gallery, said
Hedley lectured at the Courtauld Institute of London University and
advised museums throughout the world on restoration.
   ``He was one of the most internationally celebrated people in
the whole of the restoration scene,'' Bomford said.
   ``It is no exaggeration to say his research saved valuable works
for future generations.''
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   Fax machines were whirring and researchers
were combing legal opinions Tuesday as interest groups in the
nation's capital began mobilizing to uncover information about
David H. Souter, President Bush's choice for a Supreme Court seat.
   Conservative and liberal activists alike were taking a
wait-and-see attitude.
   They acknowledged the president caught them a little off guard
by moving so swiftly to choose a successor to William J. Brennan,
who announced his surprise retirement from the court just three
days before Souter was named Monday to succeed him.
   Activists on both sides agreed the Senate confirmation process
for Souter would be searching but nothing like the battle royal
that engulfed, and ultimately defeated, Robert Bork when former
President Ronald Reagan picked him for a 1987 court vacancy.
   Souter is ``clearly not like Bork,'' said Elliot Mincberg of
People for the American Way. ``He doesn't have much of a track
record.''
   Mincberg's liberal organization took a leading role three years
ago in lobbying against Bork, who had written extensive attacks on
liberal high court rulings and activist judges.
   But Mincberg said so far there are no similar plans this time.
   ``We just don't know enough about him (Souter) to make a
judgment,'' he said. ``But we hope the senators will provide a
searching inquiry.''
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said his organization is
withholding judgment. But he expressed concern that Brennan's
departure comes at a time when the court ``is turning more and more
to a narrow and restrictive view of the Constitution to the
detriment of minorities, women, the poor and the powerless.''
   Souter, a 50-year-old bachelor, served seven years on the New
Hampshire Supreme Court before Bush appointed him to the
Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals this year.
   His record reveals little about his views on abortion and other
divisive social issues he is sure to confront if confirmed by the
Senate.
   Conservative activist Pat McGuigan said his fax machine was
``overheating'' as it spews out reams of material on Souter's
opinions as a state judge.
   ``It looks on first impression like he's a good nominee,''
McGuigan said, adding, ``nobody knows anything about him.''
   He said, ``In terms of Senate confirmation, this is very
helpful.''
   The United Conservatives of America gave the nomination ``a
cautious thumbs-up'' with Richard A. Viguerie, chairman of the
group saying, ``most conservatives today have nervous smiles.''
   ``We think we can be happy, but we're a little apprehensive. We
don't know a lot about Judge Souter,'' he said.
   But there was no approval, cautious or otherwise, from Peter
Flaherty, chairman of the Conservative Campaign Fund and former
chairman of Citizens for Reagan.
   ``There remain too many unanswered questions about who he is and
how this nomination came about,'' Flaherty said. ``I do know one
thing: President Bush needlessly passed over a number of highly
qualified candidates for the court whose philosophy is well-known.
In doing so, he has taken an unacceptable risk.''
   Souter's nomination was compared by some to those of Sandra Day
O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy, two of Reagan's appointees to the
high court. Both underwent a fair amount of scrutiny in the Senate,
and both were confirmed rather easily to become conservative
justices.
   Brennan is the first liberal justice to leave the court since
William O. Douglas retired in 1975.
   Kennedy replaced Justice Lewis F. Powell, a swing vote on the
closely divided court. Bork was Reagan's first choice for the seat.
Douglas Ginsburg, Reagan's second choice, withdrew after admitting
he had smoked marijuana.
   Some activists said that by picking Souter, Bush achieved at
least two short-term political gains. He short-circuited efforts by
opposing sides lobbying for someone with a clear stand on abortion,
they said, and he selected someone non-controversial with excellent
prospects of winning Senate approval.
   Phil Gutis of the American Civil Liberties Union said his
organization normally does not take a position on Supreme Court
nominees, as it did in the case of Bork.
   ``We opposed Bork because it was such an extreme case,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Apollo astronauts and Soyuz
cosmonauts who met in space 15 years ago this month said Tuesday
greater space cooperation could save both of their countries time
and money.
   ``We have now very good orbital complex,'' cosmonaut Alexei
Leonov said, referring to the Soviet space station Mir. ``But we
don't have good transport system. We use only Soyuz spacecraft. It
is not enough.''
   Leonov suggested that the Soviets use U.S. shuttles and
Americans, in turn, have access to Mir, which was launched in 1986.
   ``I'm sure we could use Mir right now,'' said astronaut Vance
Brand, commander of the shuttle Columbia's delayed astronomy
mission.
   Both Columbia and Atlantis have been disabled by hydrogen leaks.
   Leonov, Brand and the other three men who made history on July
17, 1975, when Apollo and Soyuz docked 140 miles above Earth, said
during a news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston that
their mission set the stage for U.S.-Soviet space relations.
   ``To us it was a symbol that here were countries with two
absolutely different languages, two different units of measurement
and two political philosophies, yet we set forth a common goal,''
said Thomas Stafford, who commanded the Apollo mission.
   Leonov and cosmonaut Valery Kubasov have been on an Apollo-Soyuz
reunion tour of the United States the past two weeks with Stafford
and former astronaut Donald ``Deke'' Slayton. The four plan to
visit Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., on
Wednesday and Florida's Kennedy Space Center on Thursday.
   Brand has been unable to take part in the reunion activities,
except for Tuesday's program, because of his preparations for the
Columbia mission.
   Stafford, a retired Air Force lieutenant general, said he would
like to see a repeat of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, as well as a
cosmonaut on a shuttle and an astronaut on Mir during the next
decade.
   He stressed the importance of Soviet input in America's plans
for missions to the moon and Mars.
   ``Sometimes it is very healthy to compete and some other times
it is important and necessary to work together,'' said Kubasov.
``An important and complicated technological mission such as a
flight to Mars is certainly one of those which would necessitate
cooperation.''

<HEAD>Romanian Senate Votes to Change National Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Romanian Senate voted Tuesday to
restore Dec. 1 as Romania's national day, as it was before
Communist rule.
   The previous national day was Aug. 23, commemorating the date in
1944 when Romania broke its alliance with the Axis and sided with
the Allies in World War II. The alliance with the Soviet Union
paved the way for 45 years of communist domination of this country.
   Dec. 1 marks the 1918 union of Transylvania with the other
provinces comprising present-day Romania _ Wallachia and Moldavia.
   The proposal must also pass a vote in the House of Deputies,
which is scheduled to debate the issue Wednesday. The Senate vote
was seen, however, as ensuring its final passage.
   The choice of a date not directly related to last December's
revolution that toppled the communist dictatorship reflects popular
disagreement over which date is most important _ Dec. 16-17, when
riots in the western city of Timisoara began the uprising, or the
overthrow of Nicolae Ceausescu on Dec. 22.
   ``Neither (possible date) can give people the right to cancel
Dec. 1,'' said Sen. Dan Iosif of the ruling National Salvation
Front. ``Communists alone dared to cancel it. Let's hope no one is
ever so bold as to do it again.''
   But Laura Anton, 23, reflected the opinion of some more
concerned with recent events than the country's history: ``I do not
think it is fair that the national day be Dec. 1, since it means
nothing to us,'' she insisted. ``It should be either Dec. 22 or at
least Dec. 17.''

<HEAD>Animal Rights Activists Decry Annual Pony Swim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHINCOTEAGUE, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists are gathering
on Chincoteague Island this week to protest what they call the
mistreatment of the island's famed wild ponies during the annual
pony swim.
   Every year for 65 years, the volunteer firemen of Chincoteague
have rounded up the wild ponies on the neighboring coastal barrier
island of Assateague and auctioned off some of the foals to control
the size of the herd.
   On Wednesday, the ponies will be driven across the narrow inlet
that separates the islands and herded through the town's streets to
a penning area. This year's auction will be Thursday, with the
proceeds going to the volunteer fire department.
   Last year, the department sold 77 foals for $40,000. Some of the
foals purchased are returned to the island at the request of the
buyers.
   The weeklong celebration brings about 30,000 people to the tiny
community.
   The animals are thought to be the descendants of ponies that
washed ashore from shipwrecks during Colonial times. They gained
fame from Marguerite Henry's children's classic ``Misty of
Chincoteague,'' first published in 1947.
   Animal rights groups, such as the Charlottesville-based Voices
for Animals and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in
Washington, D.C., say the round up, penning and auction are cruel,
especially to the young animals.
   The ponies ``must swim unfamiliar waters, after which they are
stampeded through town, separated from their mothers and sold at
auction,'' said Susan Weidman of Voices for Animals.
   ``It's obvious that the fire company does not have the best
interest of the horses at heart,'' she said.
   PETA is upset that unweaned foals are auctioned off. Such
animals need special care if they are to survive away from their
mother, said PETA spokeswoman Siriol Evans.
   None of the groups said they planned to actively protest the
pony swim or auction this year, but will observe the events and
help the animals if necessary.
   The Humane Society of the United States has been monitoring the
event for 20 years.
   Gail Eisnitz, a field investigator for the Humane Society in
Washington, said conditions for the animals have improved, although
six animals have died in the last two years.
   One year, horses ate toxic chokecherry leaves off bushes
overhanging the pen, became sick and died.
   As a result of those deaths, the Chincoteague National Wildlife
Refuge on Assateague threatened to revoke the fire department's
permit to graze the animals on the refuge if the department did not
provide a veterinarian for the swim, penning and auction.
   Last year, the department had veterinarians on call but two
horses still died.
   This year, Terry said, the fire department has hired a
veterinarian to stay on the site full time.
   Ms. Eisnitz said the national Fish and Wildlife Service has
demanded other improvements in exchange for the grazing rights.
   ``The fire department has enlarged the corral, provided a shaded
area and more water for the animals. They have also cut back the
chokecherry bushes,'' she said.
   The fire department works year round to help the herd, which
numbers around 200. The animals are regularly checked by a
veterinarian.

<HEAD>Victim's Family Seeks to Prevent Murderer From Profiting From Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The family of a young woman killed by her
romantic rival has filed a lawsuit to keep the convicted murderer
from profiting from the crime by selling her story to authors or
movie producers.
   The parents of Lisa Cihaski filed a wrongful death lawsuit
against Lori Esker, 21, seeking an undisclosed amount of money,
including compensation for their daughter's funeral and burial.
   ``There is no way that she should be able to profit from this.
She won't if we have anything to say about it,'' said Richard
Weber, the lawyer for Vilas and Shirley Cihaski.
   Ms. Esker, a former county dairy princess, has had offers from
movie producers to sell her story but won't pursue them, her lawyer
said Monday.
   She was convicted June 14 of first-degree intentional homicide
in the Sept. 20 strangulation of Ms. Cihaski, 21. She faces a
mandatory life prison term when she is sentenced July 31.
   Testimony during the trial portrayed Ms. Esker as an obsessively
jealous woman who believed Ms. Cihaski had stolen her boyfriend and
intentionally killed her to eliminate the competition in a love
triangle.
   Ms. Esker was the reigning Marathon County Dairy Princess _ an
award based on talent and leadership in agriculture _ when she
killed Ms. Cihaski.
   Weber likened the case to the highly publicized ``Son of Sam''
killings in New York in the late 1970s in which the killer, David
Berkowitz, made money from his story. The state of New York
subsequently passed a law banning such profiteering, Weber said.
   ``Maybe something like this will cause the Legislature to think
about it and pass some sort of legislation to protect victims of
crimes and their families,'' Weber said.
   One of Ms. Esker's lawyers, Dean Strang of Milwaukee, said
producers for big-screen movies and made-for-television movies have
sent ``feelers'' to her asking about buying the rights to her story.
   ``Both Lori and her family from the very start have made it
crystal clear that they do not intend to profit from this tragedy
in any way,'' Strang said.
   The civil suit against Ms. Esker was filed last week in Marathon
County Circuit Court.

   David Souter drives cars until they rust. He
was an altar boy in his hometown clapboard Episcopal church. He has
a sharp Yankee sense of humor, capable of piercing stuffed shirts.
He climbs mountains.
   He lives alone on the family farm _ a ``monastic life,'' says
Sen. Warren Rudman, a friend. He is sober, cautious, solidly
conservative, erudite. When the White House telephoned Sunday
night, Souter was home, researching the law books.
   Dissecting the life and thoughts of this 50-year-old New England
bachelor became an overnight industry in Washington after President
Bush picked him to take the Supreme Court seat of liberal justice
William J. Brennan, a dominant figure even in dissent.
   At law firms, on Capitol Hill, at the pro- and anti-abortion
lobbies, over a thousand lunch tables, on the long-distance phone
to anyone in New Hampshire who might know him, Souter was Topic A
on Tuesday.
   The nominee offered a thin paper trail: His resume lists only
one article, a tribute to a new Hampshire judge. He has written no
opinions in the scant time since Bush put him on the Boston-based
1st Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Still, a verdict was taking shape.
   ``Central to the right'' rather than ``central to the left,''
offered Stanley W. Brown, a prominent Manchester, N.H., lawyer.
   ``But you aren't going to pick it up in any of his writings,''
added Brown. ``You probably won't in the future. He will follow the
case where the case takes him.''
   Retired New Hampshire lawyer Gordon Tiffany said Souter is
capable of shedding political biases when deciding a case.
   ``I believe whether it's liberal or conservative, it's not the
issue in his mind,'' Tiffany said. ``The issue in his mind is what
was intended in the Constitution that this democracy should live up
to, and those are the ideas he believes in.''
   Lawyers call that principle ``stare decisis'' _ respect for
judicial precedent. One government official who is familiar with
Souter's background _ but is unwilling to be quoted by name _ said
Souter goes by the values and philosophy of ``the Great
Dissenter,'' conservative court giant Oliver Wendell Holmes,
another stickler for precedent.
   The official said he took that to mean that Souter would be
reluctant to overturn a previous decision such as Roe vs. Wade,
which legalized abortion in 1973.
   Souter (it rhymes with ``scooter'') steeped himself in classical
law and literature; he continues a program of reading books that
Holmes read.
   Acquaintances remark on Souter's humorous side. One calls him a
raconteur.
   He has ``a wicked sense of humor that can skewer the most
stuffed shirt,'' said close friend Tom Rath, who succeeded Souter
as state attorney general. Another friend, lawyer John Barto, says
he ``has a twinkle in his eye.''
   His is the kind of humor that ``helps to make a person
balanced,'' said Tiffany.
   Souter served as president of the board of Concord Hospital. At
a retirement party, recalled hospital president Dr. Richard Warner,
``he displayed the most fantastic, dry sense of humor that you can
imagine.''
   For all that, Souter was a notorious hard worker, said Warner.
   ``I never worked so hard in my life than when he was here,'' the
doctor said. ``His method of leadership is to kind of be behind the
scenes and make things happen.''
   Added another friend _ and sponsor _ Sen. Rudman, R-N.H.: ``If
he has any faults, I believe it's that he's worked too hard all his
life. But that's the way he is.''
   Even in his 1957 yearbook at Concord High School, ``Soutie'' was
described as studious and hard-working, but also witty and in
constant demand. Classmates called him most literary, most
sophisticated _ and most likely to succeed.
   A yearbook sketch shows the young Souter's face imposed on a
drawing of a caveman, dragging a classmate, Marjorie Macleod, by
the hair.
   His yearbook photograph shows a grinning young man with a crew
cut and bushy eyebrows. He is wearing a conservative brown suit. He
was an altar boy at the century-old Holy Cross Episcopal Church in
Weare, N.H.
   Now he worships at the St. Andrews Episcopal Church in
Hopkinton, N.H. A member of the congregation, Kathy Pepin, said he
always helps a woman in a wheelchair.
   ``Every single Sunday he wheels her out of the church and brings
her to her car, always joking and laughing with her at the same
time,'' she said.
   Friends say Souter has a parsimonious nature. Despite a net
worth of over $600,000, he drove cars until they were rusty with
age.
   When he goes mountain climbing with his law clerks, said lawyer
Jack Middleton, ``they come back dragging their tongues.''
   He lives alone at the Souter family farmhouse in Weare, N.H. He
shared the house with his widowed mother, Helen, until she moved
into a retirement home.
   Mrs. Souter, 82, said she shed a tear when he called from
Washington Monday with the news. She said she'll miss his weekly
visits.
   ``Isn't that silly, but being a mother, I'd miss him if he went
to Boston,'' said Mrs. Souter.

<HEAD>Senate To Vote Wednesday On Denouncing Durenberger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate will vote Wednesday on a resolution
denouncing Sen. Dave Durenberger for financial misconduct. Only
Durenberger and, perhaps, fellow Minnesota Republican Rudy
Boschwitz are expected not to vote for the resolution.
   Durenberger's press secretary, Lois West, said the senator would
vote ``present.'' Boschwitz's press secretary, Tim Droogsma, said
his boss may vote the same way.
   West said Durenberger had ruled out a challenge to the
resolution, which she said the rest of Durenberger's colleagues are
expected to approve.
   ``There have been senators who said they would support him in
whatever he wanted them to do,'' West said. ``Durenberger, if
asked, has been saying that he would just as soon they accept it _
as he has done.''
   The Senate Ethics Committee recommended last week that the full
chamber denounce Durenberger for ``unequivocally unethical''
conduct in connection with a book-promotion scheme and Senate
payments on his Minneapolis condominium.
   Durenberger will be required to make up to $123,000 in
restitution to the Senate.
   He had appealed to the committee for a lighter penalty, saying
denouncement was ``much too onerous.''
   ``Once the decision was made, he said he wasn't going to
challenge it. It was appropriate to argue (the penalty) in
advance,'' West said.
   Boschwitz was considering voting against the resolution until he
talked to Durenberger and learned he would not challenge the
sanction, Droogsma said.
   Boschwitz believes Durenberger has already been punished by the
length of the 22-month-old ethics investigation and the $500,000 in
legal fees he has incurred, Droogsma said.

   About 1,400 viewers of Cable News Network's
``Newsnight'' dialed a 900 number to select two stories to be aired
on the early-morning news show Tuesday.
   The winners of the viewer poll: stories on the controversial
anti-depression drug Prozac and an Alabama marijuana eradication
program.
   ``This was the shakedown cruise,'' executive producer Joshua
Loory said after the show, which was the network's first attempt at
interactive television. ``I think there were some minor production
problems, but all in all, it went pretty well. I'm tickled right
now.''
   Near the beginning of the hour-long show, which starts at
midnight, viewers were presented with a menu of six stories and the
900 number, which costs 75 cents to call. The calls were tabulated
by computer and the two most popular stories were fit into the
regular newscast, one in the top half-hour, the other in the second
half-hour.
   Besides the two winners, viewers had a choice of stories on the
latest testimony in Washington Mayor Marion Barry's drug trial, a
sailing program designed to keep native American teens off drugs,
summer jobs and efforts to save the spotted owl.
   The story on Prozac received 35 percent of the vote, while the
drug eradication program received 26 percent. The stories on the
sailing program, summer jobs and the spotted owl got few votes, he
said.
   Loory said the show's producers are content to leave viewer
selection at two stories.
   ``We're still very much in control of what's going into the
show,'' he said.
   Although the network has no current plans to use the poll as a
long-term guide, ``it'll probably be pretty interesting to look at
the choices down the road and see what the viewers are selecting,''
Loory said.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from some of the New
Hampshire Supreme Court opinions by David H. Souter, President
Bush's choice for the Supreme Court.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _In a 1988 ruling, Souter said a state law was unconstitutional
when applied to bar the New Hampshire Disabilities Rights Center,
authorized by state law to provide legal services to the poor, from
representing some disabled clients who were not poor.
   ``The DRC's request runs counter to the applicable state
statutes,'' Souter said. ``Despite this conflict, we hold that
enforcement of state law to prohibit the DRC, as a non-profit
corporation, from representing non-indigent clients in its advocacy
in behalf of disabled people would violate the First and 14th
Amendments of the National Constitution.
   ``Organizations, their members and their staff lawyers may
assert a protected First Amendment right of association for
non-commercial purposes to advocate the enforcement of legal and
constitutional rights of those members, or of others within a
definite class whom the organization exists to serve.
   ``When such advocacy may reasonably include the provision of
legal advice or take the form of litigation, the organization may
itself provide legal representation to its members or beneficiaries
despite state regulations restricting legal practice and the
solicitation of clients.''
   _In a 1988 decision, Souter ordered a new trial for a man who
had been convicted of sexual assault. He said the man's lawyer
wrongly was blocked from offering evidence of the alleged victim's
public behavior with other men, a vital aspect of the defendant's
claim that she had consented.
   ``During the noon hour of June 28, 1985, the defendant, Richard
Colbath, went with some companions to the Smokey Lantern tavern in
Farmington, where he became acquainted with the female complainant.
There was evidence that she directed sexually provocative attention
toward several men in the bar with whom she associated during the
ensuing afternoon, the defendant among them.
   ``The two of them eventually left the tavern and went to the
defenant's trailer. It is undisputed that sexual intercourse
followed; forcibly according to the complainant, consensual
according to the defendant. In any case, before they left the
trailer the two of them were joined unexpectedly by a young woman
who lived with the defendant, who came home at an unusual hour
suspecting that the defendant was indulging in faithless behavior.
   ``With her suspicion confirmed, she became enraged, kicked the
trailer door open and went for the complainant, whom she assaulted
violently and dragged outside by the hair. It took the intervention
of the defendant and a third woman to bring the melee to an end.''
   _In another sexual assault case, Souter wrote for the court in
1987.
   ``During final argument in the defendant's trial on two counts
of aggravated felonious assault and one of kidnapping, the
prosecutor commented on defense counsel's failure to elicit any
testimony indicating the victim was promiscuous. The defense
objected on the ground that the (state) rape shield law would have
precluded admission of any such evidence, and objected further to
the (trial judge's) refusal to give any curative instruction.
   ``The comment can reasonably be interpreted as nothing more than
a response to defense counsel's attempts, in cross-examination and
closing arguments, to present the victim as a woman of small virtue
seeking a stranger for sexual amusement.
   ``This intimation was the whole point of defense counsel's
fishing for testimony that the victim and her friends went to the
club to drink, mingle with the crowd and dance with men they did
not know. Even though the fishing did not net much, defense counsel
stuck to the point in a closing argument that held the victim up as
someone who drank at the club, walked through the crowd, `maybe'
danced, and invited male pursuit by her solitary departure.
   ``In a word, the defense tried to paint the victim as
promiscuous, and there was nothing wrong with the prosecution's
plain contention that the try had failed.''
   _In a 1988 decision, Souter upheld a robbery conviction over
arguments that the defendant had been arrested unlawfully.
   ``On otherwise deserted streets, and within minutes of a late
evening robbery in a small town, the (police) officer saw an
individual who matched the victim's description of the perpetrator
as a male with bushy hair. While the rain might have induced his
rapid gait, it did nothing to explain away his highly suspicious
behavior in taking no ostensible notice of a bright spotlight
suddenly shining upon him.
   ``Reasonable caution and prudence were satisfied in deciding
that the man on the street had probably committed the robbery.''
   _In 1989, Souter said a bank could not be held contractually
liable for failing to discover poor workmanship on a construction
project for which it had given loans to Ross and Virginia Seymour.
   ``The Seymours make a further try at salvaging the contract
claim by asserting that bank officers orally agreed to shift the
Seymours' responsibility to the bank, pointing to a loan officer's
alleged remark that the bank's inspections would be a `safeguard
and well worth it.' They conveniently forget, however, that they
never asked the trial court for a specific finding that the remark
was made.''
   _A 1986 decision went against a child-abuse defendant who had
sought to question the alleged victim at a pretrial proceeding. The
defendant had wanted to secure a sworn statement, called a
deposition.
   ``At the most basic level, these state and federal cases reflect
the fact that court-ordered discovery does not exhaust the
practical possibilities for investigating and preparing a criminal
case. This defendant had access, for example, to a statement by the
victim that not only anticipates the victim's (trial) testimony but
provides a basis to attack the reliability of the testimony, if the
victim offers it.
   ``Given such sources of information and evidence, we simply
cannot say that discovery depositions are necessarily essential to
adequate trial preparation.''
   _The state court in 1986 ruled that doctors have a
responsibility to test for birth defects and inform pregnant women
of possible defects to given them the option of abortion. In a
concurring opinion, Souter addressed an additional issue.
   ``The questions transferred to us ... fail to raise a
significant issue in the area of malpractice litigation that we
address today. The trial court did not ask whether, or how, a
physician with conscientious scruples against abortion and the
testing and counseling that may inform an abortion decision can
discharge his professional obligation without engaging in
procedures that his religious or moral principles condemn.
   ``I do not understand the court to hold that a physician can
discharge the obligation of due care in such circumstances only by
personally ordering such tests and rendering such advice. The court
does not hold that some or all physicians must make a choice
between rendering services that they morally condemn and leaving
their profession in order to escape malpractice exposure.''

<HEAD>Officials Charge Rebels Blocking Food Shipments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials charged Tuesday that rebels in
Ethiopia have intentionally blocked shipments of desperately needed
food from reaching thousands of hungry people in the country.
   ``They have basically betrayed their people ... they have lied
... they are using food as a weapon,'' Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said
of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a rebel organization
that controls portions of northern Ethiopia. Hall is chairman of
the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   The anger of Hall and Andrew Natsios of the U.S. Office of
Foreign Disaster Assistance was triggered by the rebel group's
refusal to allow a Danish freighter flying the United Nations flag
to enter the Red Sea port of Massawa. The rebels captured Massawa
earlier this year.
   For 10 days the ship, the Nordland Saga, waited in vain for
permission to enter Massawa, Natsios said. Finally, the ship left
the region Tuesday because the rebels continued to stall.
   Natsios said excuses offered by the rebels for failure to admit
the ship were ``ludicrous.''
   Natsios and Hall spokes in interviews after meeting to discuss
the food situation in northern Ethiopia.
   The ship contained a four-man technical team who intended to
survey the channels and docks at Massawa to make sure they could
accommodate vessels carrying 25,000 tons of food. Those ships have
been diverted elsewhere.
   Hall said the rebels have reneged on an earlier promise to let
the ship land. In an interview on ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' show on
April 4, Tesfai Ghermazien, a spokesman for the liberation front,
said the rebels would open up the port.
   If food cannot get into Ethiopia through Massawa, famine could
worsen rapidly in the next few weeks, Natsios said.
   Until now, food has gone into the country by land from the
south. But the rainy season, which began this week, will soon make
roads impassable to trucks, he said.
   In April, the Ethiopian government estimated that 4.4 million
people were threatened with starvation and said its total emergency
food needs would total more than 900,000 tons this year.

   President Bush interviewed Edith H. Jones, a
federal appellate judge from Houston, as well as appeals court
judge David H. Souter before choosing Souter for the Supreme Court,
administration sources said Tuesday.
   There were four finalists for the nomination, but only Jones,
41, and Souter, 50, were interviewed by Bush, said the sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Bush interviewed them separately
at the White House on Monday, they said.
   Other finalists for the position were Laurence H. Silberman, 54,
a member of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, and
Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr, 44, the sources said.
   Silberman voted in the 2-1 majority last Friday as the
Washington appeals court set aside the Iran-Contra convictions of
former White House aide Oliver L. North.
   Jones, a member of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, had
practiced in the same Houston law firm where Secretary of State
James A. Baker III was once a partner. President Reagan appointed
her to the appellate court in 1985.
   Bush was impressed by her during the interview and she will
remain on the list of prospective Supreme Court nominees for
possible future vacancies, said one administration official.

   Marla Maples, still hoping for a fairy-tale
ending with Donald Trump, is fighting a subpoena to testify about
his prenuptial agreement with Ivana Trump, a publicist for the
actress said Tuesday.
   Chuck Jones commented on a Daily News report that Mrs. Trump's
lawyer, Michael Kennedy, had obtained testimony from bodyguards and
other Trump organization employees for an Aug. 20 hearing on the
prenuptial agreement.
   The testimony proves ``not only that Trump was having an affair
with Marla, but that he funneled money through Chuck Jones to pay
for her credit cards, and that he comped (didn't bill) her for
anything and everything she wanted at his hotels,'' Kennedy was
quoted as saying.
   ``In the hotel business, everybody comps,'' Trump told the News.
``So what? I took a gift tax on everything. And now that Marla's
earning money, she's paying me back.''
   Jones said he could not comment directly on Kennedy's assertions
because he and Maples have been subpoenaed to give depositions for
the prenuptial agreement hearing.
   But he said he would fight the subpoena because his opinion ``is
irrelevant to the premarital agreement.'' He said Maples also is
fighting the deposition subpoena.
   Kennedy said he was misquoted in the News, although he wouldn't
specify how. He had no response to Jones's comments, said his
assistant, Gregory Lenihan.
   The News, meanwhile, said Maples still dreams of a future with
the mogul.
   ``Of course I would think about it, of course,'' she said when
asked if she'd consider marrying The Donald. ``This could be a
story with a very beautiful ending.''
   ``Didn't King Edward once fall in love with a married woman and
leave his throne?'' Jones said Tuesday. Edward abdicated to marry
Wallis Simpson, a divorced American commoner.
   ``It's life,'' Jones said. ``She (Maples) can't be faulted for
any of that.''
   ``She had nothing to do with the marital problems of Donald and
Ivana Trump and doesn't want the public to think that she did,''
said Jones. ``She just feels the timing is right to take a stand.''
   Maples, who has been romantically linked to the New York
developer for eight months, described Ivana Trump as a ``cold''
woman who is neglecting her children.
   She said Mrs. Trump is ``out every night in London and New York,
going on dates to her society parties, while Donald is home raising
the children.''
   ``I see my children every single day,'' Mrs. Trump told the News
through her spokeswoman, Lisa Calandra. ``Donald sees them once a
week at most and has gone weeks on end without seeing them at all.
   ``Beyond that, I won't dignify anything Marla Maples has to say.
She sounds just like Donald,'' Mrs. Trump was quoted as saying.

   The millionaire campaigning to lower
Americans' cholesterol levels to reduce the risk of heart attacks
said Tuesday his fight against fast-food fat isn't finished despite
a victory on the french-fry front.
   Phil Sokolof, president and chief financial backer of the
National Heart Savers Association, said he was pleased that
McDonald's Corp. and Wendy's joined Burger King and several other
fast-food chains in switching to all-vegetable oils for cooking
french fries.
   McDonald's officials said the company's announcement Monday to
switch to cottonseed and corn oil had nothing to do with Sokolof's
anti-fat campaign against the fast-food restaurants.
   But Sokolof said his ads criticizing McDonald's and other
restaurants for cooking foods in beef tallow or a vegetable-beef
combination oil rather than using what he called heart-healthy oils
speeded up the process.
   Sokolof, who claims to have spent more than $2.5 million in the
ad campaigns, said the fat issue has been forced in front of food
company executives by the public, not by him.
   ``The American public as consumers have the power to move
mountains,'' he said. ``McDonald's is a mountain.''
   Wendy's International spokesman Denny Lynch said from Columbus,
Ohio, Tuesday that converting to corn oil will cost more, but he
wouldn't say how much.
   ``It would be safe to say that each chain will spend millions
more'' each year, he said.
   He said equipment will not need to be changed, but there will be
changes in training employees, such as how often the oil should be
changed and cooking time.
   McDonald's spokeswoman Terry Capatosto said the company will use
the same supplier to buy the new french fry oil.
   ``Cost wasn't a factor at all,'' she said of the switch. The
biggest consideration was making sure the company didn't change the
taste, she said.
   Both companies said they worked for months to develop an oil
that would fry potatoes with the same taste as before.
   Sokolof, 67, formed the private foundation National Heart Savers
Association after he suffered a heart attack.
   The foundation's targets have been snacks made with tropical
oils and fast-food restaurants, though he acknowledges Americans
would have to lower the amount of meat and dairy products they
consume to lower cholesterol levels.
   Americans will continue to eat meat and dairy products and
continue to go to fast-food restaurants, he said.
   ``Fast-food restaurants are not diet emporiums. People are still
going to eat there,'' he said. ``Now they can make healthier
choices.''
   The beef tallow industry will be hurt by the all-vegetable oil
decision, said Rich Parker of the American Meat Institute. But he
said he did not know how much of an effect there would be.
   U.S. Department of Commerce figures showed that 1.2 billion
pounds of beef tallow was produced in the United States last year,
but Parker said he did not know how much of that went into cooking
oil or shortening.
   Beef tallow also is used in paint, as a lubricant, in some
plastics and some cosmetics, said Roger Mandigo, an animal science
professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
   Sokolof said he would continue to run ads for as long as it
takes to improve the public perception of cholesterol levels,
though he said he is pleased with the ``tremendous'' results from
the ads so far.
   He took out a full-page ad in Tuesday's Washington Post urging
Congress to pass a food-labeling bill requiring nutritional
information on food labels and establishing definitions for terms
such as ``lite'' and ``high in fiber.''

   The Canadian Broadcasting Company's ``Love &amp;
Hate: A Marriage Made in Hell,'' proved a happy union for America's
NBC network.
   The second installment of Canada's top-rated mini-series was the
No. 1 show on U.S. television in ratings released Tuesday by the
A.C. Nielsen Co.
   The four-hour docudrama about one of Canada's most sensational
murder cases stars Kenneth Welsh and Kate Nelligan. It was pitched
to NBC programming guru Brandon Tartikoff by producer Ivan Fecan, a
former NBC employee who now is Tartikoff's counterpart at CBC.
   Part one of ``Love &amp; Hate'' was shown on NBC a week ago and
ranked sixth in the Nielsens for that period.
   The peacock network also scored with the debut of ``Real Life
with Jane Pauley,'' on Tuesday at 10 p.m. The magazine-style show
starring the former ``Today'' co-host tied for fifth place with a
repeat of NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
   The No. 2 show was a rerun of NBC's venerable ``Cheers,''
followed by a redux of ABC's ``Roseanne.'' ABC's prime-time news
show ``20-20'' was fourth.
   In a three-way tie for seventh was NBC's ``The Golden Girls''
and Fox Broadcasting Co.'s runaway hits ``The Simpsons'' and
``Married...With Children.''
   The ``Miss Teen USA'' pageant broadcast Monday at 9 p.m. was the
No. 10 show and the eye network's only showing in the top 10.
   NBC won the overall ratings war with a 10.2 average, followed by
CBS with 8.7 and ABC with 8.4. Each ratings point represents
921,000 households.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``Love &amp;
Hate: A Marriage Made in Hell,'' Part 2, NBC, 16.3; ``Cheers,''
NBC, 15.5; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 13.8; ``20-20,'' ABC, 13.4; ``Empty
Nest'' and ``Real Life with Jane Pauley,'' (tie) NBC, 13.3;
``Golden Girls,'' NBC, 13.0; ``The Simpsons,'' Fox, 13.0;
``Married...With Children,'' Fox, (tie) 13.0; ``Miss Teen USA,''
CBS, 12.8.
   The network news battle was won again by ABC with an 8.9
average. CBS was second with an 8 and NBC finished last with 7.4.

<HEAD>Union Leaders: Corporate America's Support Will Help Health Care
Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate America's interest in national
health care reform improves the odds such legislation will ever go
anywhere, according to union leaders who announced a new health
care campaign on Tuesday.
   The business community's support for changing the nation's
health care system should help persuade the Bush administration
that federal legislation is needed, said four union presidents who
announced a fall campaign to build public support for a health care
law.
   ``If the administration view is going to be changed, it's going
to be changed by corporate America and not the AFL-CIO,'' said
Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America.
   The new ``Jobs for Justice'' health care campaign will attempt
to rally the AFL-CIO's 14.2 million members into action on the
issue, Bahr and other union leaders said.
   On Oct. 3, the unions hope to have millions of American workers
sporting lapel pins calling for health care reform.
   Also that day, they will man information booths at work sites
around the country and picket non-union businesses that don't
provide their workers with health insurance benefits.
   ``Through our public demonstrations and displays of workplace
solidarity, we'll be asking other workers and our communities to
join the AFL-CIO's grassroots health care campaign,'' said John
Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union and
chairman of an AFL-CIO's panel studying health care issues.
   Union leaders said the health care problem is too large to be
solved through labor-managment negotiations. There are 37 million
Americans who have no insurance at all and another 50 million who
have inadequate health care, they said.
   In addition, the problem has increasingly become the No. 1
dispute between workers and management as costs increase and
employers try to make workers pick up a larger share of the expense.
   ``We can't accomplish this over the bargaining table ... it has
to be through legislation,'' said William Bywater, president of the
International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine
and Furniture Workers.
   Karen Brigham, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's health care
expert, said the business community ``no longer wants to maintain
the status quo'' because health care costs have been speeding
upward by 20 percent a year for employers.
   Neither the business community nor labor leaders have agreed on
a specific proposal or how to pay for it.
   Workers have also been forced to take the matter more seriously,
Bahr said.
   ``We've seen a rash of strikes at the collective bargaining
table where workers have put their jobs on the line and said
clearly this is an issue we will fight over,'' Bahr said.

   A House panel urged a special prosecutor
Tuesday to widen the investigation of former HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce, saying it had evidence Pierce steered lucrative federal
grants to his former law firm.
   In its most detailed finding, congressional investigators
questioned whether Pierce's former law firm, a former top aide and
Pierce himself may have violated federal bribery, conspiracy and
conflict-of-interest laws during his tenure as secretary of Housing
and Urban Development.
   The panel said evidence also suggested Pierce, who served
throughout the eight-year Reagan administration, may have committed
perjury at a panel hearing when he denied involvement in the
awarding of key grants.
   ``It is obvious that Secretary Pierce did not give us the full
story,'' the panel wrote. ``However, some of his statements stand
out in that they are inconsistent and at odds with the sworn
testimony of other witnesses.''
   Pierce testified in the early stages of the probe, then invoked
his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination in refusing
later questioning.
   Urging independent counsel Arlin Adams to substantially expand
his investigation, the House Government Operations subcommittee
said its 14-month investigation uncovered ``widespread abuses,
influence peddling, blatant favoritism, monumental waste and gross
mismanagement'' at HUD during Pierce's tenure.
   Its findings were offered in a letter signed by all eight
subcommittee members _ three Republicans and five Democrats,
including Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif.
   Pierce's lawyer, Paul Perito, said there was ``nothing new,
different or worthy of attention'' in the letter. He also said it
was ``improper and inappropriate'' for the committee to direct a
letter to the prosecutor rather than the Justice Department.
   ``It appears primarily to be a rehash of stale allegations or
the stacking of faulty conclusions based upon surmise, innuendo or
conjecture, and not on hard evidence or testimony,'' Perito said.
``Hopefully, this is the last spasm of life from this subcommittee,
trying in vain to justify their continuing existence.''
   The letter asked Adams to expand his probe to perjury, Pierce's
dealings with the law firm and aide Lance Wilson, and his role in
HUD's co-insurance program in which the federal government shared
responsibility for backing large housing development projects.
   Congressional investigators said there was previously
undisclosed evidence gathered by the panel's staff involving
Pierce's dealings while secretary with the New York law firm
Battle, Fowler, Jaffin and Kheel.
   Pierce was a partner before joining the Reagan administration
and had intended to return to legal practice there, the letter said.
   Documents found in HUD files, the panel said, show that the firm
frequently sought Pierce's assistance in HUD-related matters. It
said they included having Pierce meet with their client to discuss
a development grant application and helping secure lucrative
housing subsidies.
   It cited a 1985 letter from partner Martin L. Edelman to Pierce
assistant Deborah Gore Dean seeking her help in obtaining a subsidy
for an Amherst, N.Y., project under the Section 8 Moderate
Rehabilitation program.
   It also recounted er assistance in another project there,
Allenhurst Apartments, the year before.
   ``It defies logic and reason that Ms. Dean would have assisted
Battle, Fowler in obtaining these scarce and much-in-demand
(subsidy) units for the Allenhurst project on her own without the
direct and intimate involvement of Secretary Pierce,'' the letter
said, adding that it appears Ms. Dean helped the firm at the behest
of Pierce.
   The law firm denied any wrongdoing.
   ``We are confident that no member or employeeof the firm has
engaged in any inappropriate conduct,'' said Thomas Glynn, a
partner and spokesman for Battle, Fowler.
   The panel also said it had evidence that Wilson, who later
became a housing specialist with the investment company Paine
Webber, and Pierce engaged in activities aimed at benefiting each
other.
   It cited 1988 telephone messages in which Wilson, while working
for Paine Webber, called Pierce to tell him of the status of
pending financial deals and of the role his former law firm had
played in the deals.
   ``This suggests that ... Lance Wilson, with the secretary's
knowledge and approval, acted to steer HUD-related legal work to
the law firm in which Secretary Pierce had been a partner in the
past, and was likely to become a partner again in the future,'' the
letter said.
   In suggesting Pierce may have committed perjury, the panel cited
Pierce's denial that he directed Ms. Dean or anyone else to approve
particular grants.
   That was contrasted with public testimony by former HUD
officials who said Pierce did direct funding on specific projects.
Former assistant DuBois Gilliam testified that HUD ``dealt strictly
in politics.''
   Ms. Dean refused to testify, citing constitutional rights
against self-incrimination.

   David H. Souter, in a hearing on his
nomination to a federal appellate judgeship earlier this year,
defended overturning a sexual assault conviction on grounds that
the defendant's right to interrogate his accuser overrode the
woman's right of privacy.
   But Souter also assured Sen. Edward M. Kennedy that he respected
the need for ``shield'' laws discouraging defense attorneys from
prying into the sexual lives of sexual assault victims. ``Yes,''
Souter replied when asked if he would be sensitive to this problem.
   Nevertheless, he said, the New Hampshire case in question was
one in which ``the rape shield law had to yield.'' He said the
victim's right to privacy was effectively overridden by trial
testimony that she had made sexually provocative statements to
several men in a bar in the hours before the alleged assault.
   ``Sensitivity to that particular (privacy) dilemma is something
which is enormously important in terms of the balance of
interests,'' Kennedy told Souter during the Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing April 5. The committee released a transcript of
the hearing Tuesday.
   The 50-year-old Souter, selected by President Bush to succeed
William J. Brennan on the Supreme Court, was explaining his
thinking as a member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. His
opinion, on behalf of a unanimous court, was subsequently
criticized by People for the American Way, a Washington-based
liberal-oriented lobbying organization.
   The decision reversed the trial court conviction of a man
accused of aggravated rape on the ground that the lower court had
refused to admit evidence about the victim's public behavior with
men in the hours before the alleged assault.
   The lower court had instructed the jury that the victim's
conduct with other individuals was not relevant to the question of
whether she consented to sex with the defendant.
   Souter told the hearing that the question before the court was
whether the woman's privacy right under the state's rape shield law
must give way to the defendant's constitutional right to
cross-examine his accuser.
   ``The complaining witness' behavior immediately prior to their
departure from the public bar in question had a very high degree of
significance,'' Souter said. ``So that was an example of a case,
which is not unfamiliar to us, in which the rape shield law had to
yield.''
   Kennedy also questioned Souter about a ruling in which he upheld
the conviction of a man who, under questioning by police before his
arrest, said, ``If you think I am going to confess to you, you are
crazy.''
   The Massachusetts Democrat noted that the 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, on which Souter ultimately was seated, threw out the
conviction in a ``rather critical'' ruling that reversed Souter's.
   The higher court said that Souter's ruling placed too much stock
in the man's seemingly self-incriminating remark _ and gave
short-shrift to the general theme of the remark in which the man
was saying he wouldn't answer police questions at the time.
   Souter's ruling, the appellate court said, ``ignores the
teaching that the protection of the Fifth Amendment (against
self-incrimination) is not limited to those in custody or charged
with a crime.''
   The judge told the committee, ``The nub of the disagreement is
that the language which you (Kennedy) quoted is language which we
read to be essentially inculpatory and not a Fifth Amendment
invocation.''
   Kennedy asked, ``What assurance can you give us that you will
not take a crabbed view of the scope of that fundamental
constitutional protection?''
   The judge replied:
   ``Well, I think the assurance that the principle that you have
just enunciated goes without saying, or should go without saying,
in the mind of any judge, including mine. ...''
   He was approved by voice vote in the committee, and,
subsequently, in the same fashion on the Senate floor, for the
federal appellate judgeship.

   The Bush administration opposes forgiving any
of Poland's $41 billion debt but is reviewing the issue, Assistant
Secretary of State Raymond G. H. Seitz told Congress Tuesday.
   Seitz, who is in charge of European affairs, appeared before the
subcommittee on Europe of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind, said in an
interview afterwards that Poland's debt will have to be reduced
sooner or later.
   Poland's government has been asking repeatedly for some
reduction. Foreign business is wary of investing in Polish efforts
to move away from a communist system because of the debt overhang.
   At the hearing, Hamilton pressed Seitz on the question. Rep. Jan
Meyers, R-Kan, another member of the panel, also told him that
Poland needs debt relief.
   Seitz said the administration is aware of Poland's problems and
pointed out that debt repayments have been put off. According to
the World Bank, Poland owed an additional $7.1 billion in back
interest in 1988.
   ``You're opposed to forgiveness?'' Hamilton asked.
   ``Yes, at the moment,'' Seitz replied.
   Treasury Nicholas F. Brady devised a reduction plan last year
for countries with big debts to banks. But Poland's debts are owed
largely to other governments, and only about $9 billion is owed to
banks.
   West Germany and France are major creditors. About $3 billion is
owed to the United States.
   David E. Mulford, Brady's undersecretary for international
affairs, had warned that forgiving Poland's debt would set a
precedent for others with big debts to governments.
   President Bush set a precedent himself last month by offering to
forgive some debt of Latin American countries, which owe to
governments as well as to banks. Earlier he had followed some
European creditor countries and Canada in offering to forgive a
billion dollars worth of debts that the poorest countries in Africa
owe to the United States.

<HEAD>Robertson Admits Only A Fraction of Oldest Trees Survive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson
acknowledged before Congress on Tuesday that only about 10 percent
of the Northwest's ``old trees'' remain standing and half of those
are scheduled to be cut over the next 50 years.
   However, Robertson disagreed with environmentalists who say the
region's old-growth forests are being destroyed. New trees are
being replanted in their place, he said.
   The House Interior national parks and public lands subcommittee
is considering legislation to protect the region's forests without
crippling its timber industry.
   Environmentalists have maintained for some time that only 10
percent of the Northwest's original forests, which they call
``ancient forests,'' have survived harvests and natural disasters
over the past 150 years.
   However, the timber industry has disputed those figures and in
the past the Forest Service has declined to offer an estimate.
   Under questioning from lawmakers, Robertson acknowledged that
approximately 10 percent of what he called ``old trees'' remain in
the region.
   ``I don't know if it is 10, or 9 or 12 (percent), but it is
around that,'' Robertson said.
   Forest Service spokesman Jerry Mason said later Tuesday that
``old trees'' are those which are 200 years or older.
   In other testimony, assistant Fish and Wildlife Service Director
Ralph Morgenweck said his agency opposes a proposal by Oregon Rep.
Bob Smith that would for the next five years exempt Northwest
timber sales from the protections granted the northern spotted owl
under the Endangered Species Act.
   Smith, a Republican, attacked a recommendation by Forest Service
biologist Jack Ward Thomas and other government scientists that
would protect the owl by banning logging across 3 million acres of
Northwest forests currently open to harvests.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, the House Appropriations interior
subcommittee approved a 20 percent reduction in Pacific Northwest
timber harvests.
   An area lawmaker said the deal, which would set harvests on
Forest Service lands in the Northwest at 3 billion board feet, is
the least economically disruptive his region can expect this year.

<HEAD>GAO: Navy Should Move Slower On Submarine Program</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Navy should slow down its $44 billion
Seawolf attack submarine program because 15 of the costly vessels
will be under contract before critical testing on the lead ship has
been completed, congressional investigators said Tuesday.
   ``The SSN-21 program is using a concurrent scheduling approach
which has construction ongoing while design is continuing,'' Martin
Ferber of the General Accounting Office told a House Armed Services
subcommittee.
   The subcommittee on seapower and strategic and critical
materials heard testimony from the GAO and the Navy on the
submarine program. The full committee begins crafting its version
of the defense bill this week.
   To meet the House-approved military budget of $283 billion, the
seapower subcommittee must cut $3 billion from President Bush's
proposed request of $16.1 billion _ and the Seawolf program may be
a victim of the budget ax.
   The Navy plans to buy 29 of the SSN-21 nuclear attack submarines
by the year 2000 at a cost of $44 billion. The first submarine,
designed by the Newport News Shipbuilding Co., of Virginia and
Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Connecticut, is
estimated at $1.9 billion.
   The Navy expects the cost of subsequent submarines to decline,
averaging around $1 billion.
   The submarines will be equipped with a sophisticated computer
system that will allow the vessels to locate targets faster than
existing submarines and cut the time between detecting the enemy
and launching weapons.
   The SSN-21 will be quieter, larger and deeper diving that the
Los Angeles class of nuclear submarines, the SSN-688.
   But the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, said the
submarine program and the on-board computer system are being
developed separately with varying target dates for delivery to the
Navy.
   Under current plans, the Navy will have as many as 15 of the 29
ships under contract before the lead ship undergoes operational
tests, the GAO said. In addition, the computer system is a
``developmental risk,'' Ferber told the subcommittee.
   ``The more mature you make the system, the better off you're
going to be,'' Ferber said in recommending a delay in the program.
   But Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III argued that
concurrency is something that can't be avoided.
   ``In this declining business environment, shipyards cannot build
one ship, wait for the Navy to complete operational testing and
still be in existence when we have proven the risk is behind us,''
Garrett said.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, in approving a $289 billion
defense bill earlier this month, deferred purchasing two Seawolf
submarines at a cost of $2.3 billion because of excessive
concurrency.
   The panel instead substituted two of the SSN-688 Los
Angeles-class submarines at a cost of $1.8 billion.

<HEAD>No Increase in Disciplinary Action Against Physicians in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of serious disciplinary actions
against physicians was the same in 1988 as during the previous
year, breaking a pattern of increasing rates, a consumer group said
Tuesday.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group said state medical
boards took serious actions against 1,489 physicians in 1988, the
same number disciplined in 1987.
   The actions included license revocation or suspension and
physician probation, the group said. The group analyzed the most
recent data compiled by the Federation of State Medical Boards.
   In 1984, serious actions were taken against 745 physicians,
Public Citizen said. That increased to 1,089 in 1985 and 1,277 in
1986.
   However, Public said the 1988 disciplinary rates weren't high
enough.
   ``A physician could still operate drunk, commit a gross act of
negligence, or sexually assault a patient and receive a mere slap
on the wrist from his or her state's medical board in most
states,'' the group said.
   The group, however, said it was encouraged that 44 state
legislatures had passed legislation to strengthen state oversight
of physicians.
   Public Citizen released a report last month listing the names of
6,892 physicians who have been disciplined by state medical boards
and the federal government. The 1988 actions were not included in
that report.

   The independent counsel's office that
prosecuted Oliver North and John Poindexter should be closed, a
Republican member of the former House Iran-Contra investigating
panel said Tuesday.
   ``I believe we are well past the point where further pursuit of
this matter by an independent counsel serves any public good,''
Rep. William Broomfield of Michigan said in a letter to Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.
   But Justice Department sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said such a move would be politically difficult for
Thornburgh because it is believed Walsh is looking into the conduct
of Donald Gregg, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, in connection
with the Iran-Contra affair.
   Gregg was George Bush's national security adviser when Bush was
vice president and the sources said that closing down the office of
Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh would look like a coverup.
   Walsh has spent nearly four years and tens of millions of tax
dollars investigating and prosecuting Iran-Contra cases, said
Broomfield, who was a member of the House investigating panel.
   Broomfield's request comes just days after a divided federal
appeals court panel set aside North's Iran-Contra convictions,
reversing one of three guilty verdicts and ordering hearings to
determine whether the other two were tainted by immunized testimony
North gave Congress.
   Broomfield asked Thornburgh to exercise his authority under the
1987 independent counsel act to seek the termination of Walsh's
office and turn over any loose ends in his Iran-Contra
investigations to the Justice Department to be tied up.
   ``Nobody wants to complete this work more than we do,'' Walsh
said through a spokeswoman. ``We simply don't feel that we can fail
to develop the testimony of significant witnesses as they become
available.''
   North and Poindexter were the two highest-ranking Reagan
administration officials prosecuted in the operation that sent arms
to Iran and covert profits from their sale to Nicaragua's Contra
rebels.
   Walsh's investigation, which had cost $21 million through May,
has led to the conviction of seven people involved in the
Iran-Contra affair. The Justice Department says the investigations
have cost law enforcement agencies an additional $7.7 million, for
a total of $28.7 million.
   Broomfield said the action on North's case focused new attention
on what he termed Walsh's ``perpetual investigation.''
   ``The Iran-Contra affair has been thoroughly investigated. We've
paid for two congressional committees, a presidential commission
and an independent counsel,'' Broomfield said.
   ``Still, Walsh seems intent on ensconcing himself as part of the
permanent bureaucracy,'' he said. ``I believe the time has come to
say enough is enough.''

<HEAD>Heavy Thunderstorms Bring Flooding From Southwest to Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy rain fell across much of the nation Tuesday, and
torrential storms sent floodwaters through Tucson, Ariz., and parts
of Massachusetts.
   Several sections of Tucson were evacuated, Interstate 17 was
closed and many intersections were under as much as a foot of water.
   Thunderstorms produced 7.02 inches of rain in less than 6 hours
near Middleboro, Mass. Elsewhere in the state, more than 5 inches
in less than 4 hours caused extensive flooding at Bridgewater, 4.33
inches at Taunton left 4 feet of water on roads, and 3.05 inches
fell at Abington, stranding many vehicles.
   No strong thunderstorms or heavy rains were reported this
morning in Texas, but earlier rains left Burnt Crossing, south of
Juno, under 5 feet of water during the early morning. Crossings
near the Val Verde and Crockett-Sutton county lines in Texas were
under as much as 4 and 5 feet of water.
   Tuesday afternoon there were showers and thunderstorms over
parts of Iowa and Nebraska, and showers stretched from west-central
Texas into northwest Louisiana, and from northern New Jersey across
eastern New England into central Maine and southeast New York state.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered through north central
Ohio to the mountains of Wyoming, south to Colorado and into New
Mexico. Showers also reached from Utah into Montana, Idaho,
Washington state and northwest Oregon.
   Tropical storm Arthur has formed over the Atlantic Ocean. At
1:30 p.m. EDT the center of the storm was 160 miles east of
Trinidad moving west about 20 mph. Highest sustained winds were
about 40 mph, but there were stronger gusts.
   Low temperature records for the date were broken in Paducah,
Ken., at 60, and tied in Pueblo, Colo., at 54.
   Low temperature for the Lower 48 states Tuesday morning was 43
at Butte, Mont., Truckee, Calif., and Yellowstone National Park,
Wyo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56 at
Hayward, Calif., to 100 at both Needles and Imperial, Calif.

   A tearful mother used a lifelike rubber
doll and a porcelain toilet to show jurors Tuesday how her husband
fatally plunged her 2-year-old son headfirst into the commode as
punishment for soiling his pants.
   ``He held him way up here,'' 21-year-old Sheryl Coe testified,
grabbing the doll by the ankles and dunking its head into the
toilet. ``He flushed the toilet water so the water would flush on
his head.''
   Thomas Coe, 23, stared straight down as Mrs. Coe testified that
Bradley McGee's death came after weeks of her husband's torturing.
Coe is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.
The state rested its case after Mrs. Coe's testimony.
   Bradley died of head injuries July 28, 1989, only two months
after he was returned from state foster care to his mother and
stepfather.
   Mrs. Coe agreed to testify against her husband after pleading no
contest to second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse charges.
She is serving 30 years in prison.
   Dressed in dark-blue prison garb, Mrs. Coe said her husband's
disciplinary methods included forcing Bradley to stand in the
corner with his hands on his head, making him eat feces off the
ground and grinding his fist and cayenne pepper into the child's
genitals.
   She testified that her husband had previously dunked Bradley in
the toilet, but the last time came July 27, 1989, after Coe had
returned from a job interview.
   Mrs. Coe said her husband became furious when she told him the
child has ``made a mess'' in his pants.
   ``Tom took him back to the bathroom and dunked his head into the
toilet several times,'' she said.
   She then described how Coe threw the boy under a cold shower
``with a clunk and a boom,'' and forced him to walk into the living
room where they beat him with cushions ``until he collapsed and
went into, like, an epileptic fit.''
   Bradley was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center after a
neighbor called for help. He was pronounced dead the next day.
   In a taped statement played for the jury Tuesday, Coe said he
meant to scare the child.
   ``I turned him upside down and dunked him into the toilet. I
don't know how many times I did it _ it happened so fast. I flushed
it just to scare him,'' Coe said. ``I'm sorry I did it. I didn't
mean to do it. I lost control. It was a bad day all the way
around.''
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Coe.
   Defense attorneys concede Coe dunked the child into the toilet,
but say he should be convicted of a lesser crime because it was
merely a one-time form of punishment and there was never any intent
to harm the child.
   They have portrayed Mrs. Coe as an unstable, self-serving liar,
arguing that she has changed her account of events at least four
times.
   ``I was scared, I didn't know what to do,'' she said.
   Bradley's death came after a state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services caseworker recommended that a judge return
the child to his mother, despite a psychological report that
questioned the couple's abilities as parents and detailed their
explosive personalities. Mrs. Coe had abandoned Bradley at a
shopping mall when he was 3 months old.
   Public outrage over Bradley's death led legislators to change
the law, placing child welfare above attempts to reunite families.
   Bradley's main caseworker, Margaret Barber, was convicted June
15 of felony child abuse, and sentenced to three months' probation.
Three other caseworkers were cleared of criminal charges.

   Marion Barry's lawyers recalled convicted drug
dealer Charles Lewis to the stand Tuesday, suggesting he was at the
center of a cocaine and prostitution ring whose members testified
against the mayor.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy attacked Lewis' credibility
and that of five of Lewis' friends who testified at Barry's cocaine
and perjury trial.
   One of the government's chief witnesses, Lewis testified last
month that Barry used cocaine and crack repeatedly on two trips to
the Virgin Islands.
   The two smoked crack in a Washington, D.C., hotel room after the
mayor dumped crack rocks out of a matchbox and pulled them out of
one of his pants cuffs, Lewis testified earlier.
   In recalling Lewis, Mundy sought to undermine other witnesses,
saying that City Attorney James McWilliams and two other men
discussed ``a plan to distribute drugs.''
   There was such a discussion, Lewis said.
   McWilliams has denied that he was involved in distributing
drugs, but Lewis said he supplied McWilliams with drugs about a
dozen times.
   McWilliams gave devastating testimony against Barry, testifying
he found the mayor slumped on a bathroom toilet seat surrounded by
narcotics paraphernalia.
   Mundy asked Lewis if four women who testified against Barry were
working with or for him.
   ``No,'' said Lewis, who has acknowledged that he introduced all
four to Barry when the mayor visited the Virgin Islands.
   Mundy asked if Lewis made the four women ``available ... to
dignitaries visiting the Virgin Islands.''
   Lewis said he did not.
   Did Lewis ``provide drugs to these ladies?'' Mundy asked.
   ``We shared,'' Lewis said. ``We would put money together.''
   One of the four women testified that Barry forced her to have
sex with him.
   Under questioning from Mundy, Lewis said the woman, Linda Crique
Maynard, didn't appear to have been distraught after her time alone
with Barry. Mundy also suggested that Maynard was related to one of
the men who allegedly discussed drug distribution with McWilliams.
Lewis said he didn't know if the two were related.
   Lewis said he had not heard from the four women since he began
cooperating with the government last year.
   Mundy said Lewis gave different statements to the FBI a year ago
than he did at Barry's trial.
   Lewis said law enforcement officers who interviewed him last
year misunderstood what he said about who saw Barry allegedly smoke
marijuana on a boat trip in the Virgin Islands.
   Earlier in the day, Barry's chauffeur testified that he never
took the mayor to a municipal building the morning prosecutors say
Barry picked up crack cocaine there.
   But on cross-examination by the prosecution, Walter W. Bracey
said he had no memory of Barry's specific activities on any day
other than Sept. 7, 1988. Bracey has been the mayor's driver for 12
years.
   Bracey said he drove to Barry's home Sept. 7, 1988, and took him
directly to the grand opening of a supermarket.
   Bracey said he then drove Barry to fire department headquarters
for a meeting with city officials. Barry stayed at the meeting
until noon.
   ``Were there any stops made at any other location?'' Mundy asked.
   ``No,'' replied Bracey.
   Former crack dealer Lydia Reid Pearson has testified that she
went to city offices the morning of Sept. 7, 1988, met with the
mayor and ``handed him ... crack cocaine. ... He gave me the money
for it'' and ``I gave him'' a job application seeking city
employment. She eventually got a city job.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 cocaine possession counts, one
count of conspiracy and three counts of lying to a grand jury.

<HEAD>Nun, Three Policemen Killed in Bomb Explosion Near Armagh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ARMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1,000-pound bomb detonated by
terrorists hiding near a rural road in this border city exploded
Tuesday, killing a Roman Catholic nun and three policemen,
authorities said.
   An anonymous caller claimed responsibility for the attack on
behalf of the Irish Republican Army in North Armagh in a telephone
call late Tuesday to a news organization in Belfast.
   The caller said the IRA had killed the four people in a
``military action,'' but expressed no regret over the nun's death.
   The slaying of a nun would be seen widely as a major
embarrassment for the mainly Catholic IRA, which in recent months
has escalated its terror campaign aimed at driving the British out
of Northern Ireland.
   It was believed to be the first time a Catholic nun has been
killed in 21 years of sectarian violence in British-run Northern
Ireland, according to Jim Cantwell of the Catholic Press and
Information Office.
   The terrorist attack _ one of the deadliest in Northern Ireland
this year _aroused outrage among political and religious leaders on
both sides of the Irish border.
   ``I know all the people of Ireland join me in my condemnation of
this atrocity,'' Prime Minister Charles Haughey of the Irish
Republic said in Dublin.
   The bomb set in a culvert under the road was detonated as an
unmarked police car passed a hay field two miles outside Armagh,
police said. The nun and a female social worker were approaching in
a small car, police said.
   The blast hurled the police car into the air. It smashed into a
hedge and landed on its roof, apparently killing the three
policemen instantly.
   ``The ground shook beneath us and it was accompanied by a very
large explosion,'' said Paul Corr, the owner of a nearby gas
station.
   ``At first we did not see the police car,'' he said. ``The whole
place was a terrible mess. Then we saw two young girls in the (mini
Metro car). ... They were unconscious and looked in a pretty bad
way.''
   Corr helped emergency workers from a passing ambulance pull the
injured women from their car.
   The nun, Sister Catherine Dunne, died later in a hospital. Her
companion, whose name was not released, was listed in satisfactory
condition, police said. No ages were available for the two women.
   ``There was nothing we could do for the policemen,'' added Corr.
``Nobody could have come out of that car alive. It was dreadful.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary officers who died in the attack
were identified by police as William Hanson, 37; David Sterritt,
34, and 35-year-old Joshua Willis. Two of the officers were
married, one with four children and the other with two.
   The powerful explosion tore a crater 6-feet in diameter in the
two-lane Killylea Road, near the border with the Republic of
Ireland. The type of explosive used was not known, police said.
   Police and troops rushed reinforcements to the border area to
search for the attackers. The area is considered prime territory
for operations by the IRA.
   In Belfast, a police spokesman said an unknown number of gunmen
took over a house about 400 yards from the road early Tuesday and
held a married couple and their children at gunpoint until shortly
before the 2 p.m. attack.
   Police said a detonating wire ran from the bomb through a
freshly cut hayfield to near the house.
   The bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack in Northern
Ireland since an IRA bomb killed four soldiers of the locally
recruited Ulster Defense Regiment on April 9.
   It follows a spate of recent attacks by the IRA on British
targets in England and continental Europe.
   On Friday, a bomb caused extensive damage to London's Stock
Exchange, but no injuries were reported. A telephone caller had
warned of an IRA bombing.
   In Armagh, the ancient religious capital of Ireland, church
leaders condemned the latest attack. The town is the seat of both
the Catholic and Anglican churches throughout Ireland, north and
south.
   ``I am disgusted,'' declared the Most Rev. Robin Eames, the
Anglican primate of Ireland.
   ``My reaction is one of absolute horror that somebody ...
fulfilling their own calling as a nun has been murdered in what is
one more indiscriminate attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary.''
   In Belfast, Britain's minister for security in Northern Ireland,
John Cope, said, ``I have no doubt that we shall hear talk about
mistakes and about legitimate targets and so on. ... Nobody
deserves to be attacked in this way.''
   Earlier this year, the IRA expressed regret after gunmen shot
dead two Australian tourists who had been mistaken for British
soldiers outside a restaurant in Holland on May 27.
   The slain nun was a member of the Sisters of St. Louis, an order
of about 300 nuns throughout Ireland.
   Nearly 3,000 people have been killed since sectarian violence
erupted in Northern Ireland in 1969 and the British government sent
in troops.
   The IRA, outlawed on both sides of the border, is fighting to
unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Republic of Ireland under a socialist government.

   The White House lacks accessible restrooms and
other facilities for disabled visitors and employees, a congressman
said Tuesday.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said in a letter to President Bush
that a ``bewildering contradiction'' exists between the president's
plans to sign major disabilities rights legislation and the
existence of barriers to the disabled at the White House.
   A White House spokeswoman, Alixe Glen, said there would be no
comment until the letter is received.
   According to Levine's office:
   _A former park ranger at the White House routinely crossed
Pennsylvania Avenue and Lafayette Park to find a restroom she could
enter with her wheelchair. When she complained, she was told to
drink fewer liquids.
   _Some of the 30 children in wheelchairs who attended the Easter
egg hunt on the White House lawn this year had to leave early
because they couldn't use the portable toilets provided for
visitors.
   _Unlike the Capitol, the White House provides no special tours
for visitors with impaired hearing or vision.
   Bush plans to sign the Americans with Disabilities Act this
week. The bill guarantees disabled employees and customers access
to the workplace and to public accommodations.
   Federal buildings already are covered by a 1973 law, and Levine
aide Jon Cowan said he could find nothing in that law to exempt the
White House.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt used a wheelchair as a result of
polio, but Cowan said that none of the physical adjustments in the
White House made for Roosevelt make life easier for visitors or
employees.

   House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich, opening what
could become a bitter partisan fight, said Tuesday he favors a
censure, rather than a milder reprimand, of Rep. Barney Frank for
using his office to help a male prostitute.
   Gingrich said he was not speaking for the House leadership, but
his role as the chamber's second-ranking Republican could influence
conservatives wavering between a censure and the lesser reprimand
proposed by the ethics committee.
   The Georgia Republican's action leaves GOP members divided over
how to punish Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. While the committee
resolution is scheduled for floor action Thursday, a move to expel
Frank could be introduced and debated Wednesday by conservative GOP
Rep. William E. Dannemeyer of California. The resolution, which
would need a two-thirds vote, faces certain defeat.
   Republican floor leader Bob Michel of Illinois has not announced
his position, but one influential member, Rep. John T. Myers of
Indiana, said he will defend the reprimand in his role as ranking
GOP member of the ethics committee.
   Gingrich also must contend with Democratic leaders, who are
strongly backing the reprimand. Speaker Thomas S. Foley of
Washington emphasized Monday and again Tuesday that he expected the
unanimous ethics committee vote for a reprimand to be upheld. The
panel has six Republicans and six Democrats.
   While Gingrich went public at a news conference, a group of
Frank's liberal colleagues were quietly lobbying House members to
uphold the committee.
   A reprimand is the lowest form of punishment voted on by the
full House, and would involve approval of the ethics report.
Frank's presence would not be required.
   A censure would require Frank to stand before his colleagues
during the procedure. Also, Democratic caucus rules would require
Frank, after a censure, to be stripped of his chairmanship of the
House Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law and governmental
relations.
   The most extreme punishment is expulsion, but even Gingrich said
the action would be too extreme.
   But Gingrich's support of censure was enough to raise the
political temperature, as Frank released an angry statement in
response to the announcement.
   ``I am disappointed that there are efforts to politicize the
ethics committee report, in sharp contrast to practice in the House
in virtually every case,'' Frank wrote. ``As I said last week, I
believe the ethics committee's 10-month long study has resulted in
an accurate report and an appropriate recommendation.''
   Gingrich said he based his conclusion on one of two official
actions by Frank that, according to the committee, brought
discredit upon the House.
   He referred to a 1986 Frank memo that contained misleading
information favorable to the male prostitute, Stephen L. Gobie, who
was convicted of sex and drug charges and was on probation at the
time.
   The memo was written on Frank's official letterhead to an
individual whose name was deleted by the ethics committee, but it
wound up in the hands of a Virginia prosecutor.
   ``Should a United States congressman be allowed to misinform an
officer of the court, which is the kinder way of saying to lie to
an officer of the court, on behalf of a convicted felon who was a
cocaine dealer and a child pornographer?'' Gingrich said at a news
conference.
   ``Censure seems to me the minimum appropriate action,'' Gingrich
said.
   The ethics committee also said Frank broke the rules when he
used his office to have 33 parking tickets incurred by Gobie
dismissed, and recommended that the House order him to make
restitution to the District of Columbia.
   Gingrich insisted he was not engaging in gay-bashing, and
commented Frank's ``private behavior is private. His sexual
preferences are personal and I don't think they have any business
in this dialogue.''

<HEAD>Divided Bulgarian Parliament Fails to Elect President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deeply divided Parliament failed to
elect a state president on Tuesday to replace Socialist Petar
Mladenov, who resigned on July 6 in a row over asking for tanks to
be used against demonstrators.
   Two rounds of voting failed to produce the two-thirds majority
needed in the 400-seat Parliament to elect one of the three
candidates.
   Contending were Chavdar Kyuranov of the governing Socialist
Party, formerly the Communist Party; Petar Dertliev, leader of the
Social Democrats and the candidate of the opposition Union of
Democratic Forces, or UDF; and Viktor Valkov of the mainstream
Agrarian Party, which formerly was a Communist ally.
   In the first round, Kyuranov got 217 of the 383 valid ballots
cast; Dertliev got 130, and Valkov, 36.
   A journalist for Bulgaria's official news agency BTA said that
in the second round _ with fewer valid ballots cast _ Kyuranov got
211 votes; Dertliev, 131, and Valkov, 37.
   To win, 267 votes are needed. The Socialists hold 211 seats; the
UDF, 144, and the Agrarians, 16. Also holding seats are six
independents and 23 members of the Movement for Rights and
Freedoms, which is mainly supported by members of Bulgaria's 1
million ethnic Turkish minority.
   The deep political rifts and the distribution of the seats made
it unlikely any of the three candidates would secure the two-thirds
majority.
   Political analysts and some deputies suggested that new
candidates may be suggested following Tuesday's inconclusive votes.
   Balloting opened after four days of procedural wrangling between
the Socialists and UDF. Opposition leader Zhelyu Zhelev threatened
a walkout of his deputies Tuesday if there was no halt in what he
called the obstructive tactics of the Socialists.
   Bulgaria has been without a president since Mladenov resigned 18
days ago after experts confirmed a recording on which he called for
tanks to move against anti-government demonstrators last December.
No tanks were used, but Mladenov previously had denied making the
comment.
   At Tuesday's nationally televised Parliament session, each
candidate outlined his program for dealing with spreading social
and political unrest and Bulgaria's growing economic crisis.
   Kyuranov, a 69-year-old philosopher once expelled from the
Communist Party for his dissident views, appealed for a coalition
government but said the Socialists should face up to the
responsibility of their Communist precursors for Bulgaria's woes.
   Dertliev, 73, recalled the repression of non-Communist forces
after World War II, when he himself was imprisoned for his
political views.
   He pleaded for tolerance now, and alone of the three candidates
expressed support for peaceful political protests that have spread
since last month's elections, won by the Socialists.

   Supreme court nominee David Souter was
affiliated with two New Hampshire hospitals that perform abortions,
but officials at both facilities said Tuesday that Souter never
discussed the divisive issue.
   As with his judicial record, little about Souter's feelings
about abortion can be gleaned from his performance as a board
member of Concord Hospital or as an overseer to the Dartmouth
Hitchcock Medical School, which has an affiliated hospital that
performs abortions.
   Both hospitals have abortion guidelines; New Hampshire still has
a law making some abortions tantamount to a felony.
   But those laws, which have not been enforced since the 1973 Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion, never became an issue
while Souter was serving either on the state Superior or Supreme
courts.
   As a judge, Souter participated in just one known case dealing
with abortion, siding with the majority in a 1986 ruling that said
physicians have a responsibility to test unborn children for birth
defects and in the event defects are detected to counsel the
pregnant woman about options _ including abortion.
   Officials at the two hospitals said they had no recollection of
Souter discussing abortion at meetings or in personal conversations.
   ``Over the course of time that I've been here that issue never
came before the board,'' said Richard Warner, president of Concord
Hospital. ``He and I never talked about it.''
   Warner came to the hospital in May 1975, when Souter was a
member of its board. Souter was president of the board from 1978-85.
   Warner and others couldn't provide a specific number, but said
relatively few abortions are performed at the hospital. The
procedure usually is done at area clinics or doctors' offices, the
hospital officials said.
   At Concord Hospital and several area clinics, it's customary not
to perform abortions after 17 weeks _ seven weeks short of the end
of the second trimester, said hospital spokeswoman Beth Fensterwald.
   One exception is Dartmouth Hitchcock, where officials said there
had been rare occasions when abortions have been performed up to
the end of the second trimester. Those cases almost exclusively
involve potential harm to the pregnant women, officials said.
   Written abortion guidelines at Dartmouth Hitchcock acknowledge a
split among physicians and other staff over whether abortions
should be performed.
   ``We feel very strongly that our patients have all alternatives
discussed with them,'' the guidelines say.
   Dr. George A. Little, chairman of Dartmouth Hitchcock's child
and maternal health department, said it was possible that the
facility would refuse to perform an abortion for a woman past 17
weeks who didn't have a medical reason.
   Souter served on the overseers for the Dartmouth Medical School,
which is affiliated with the hospital.
   Dr. Robert McCollum, who retired as dean of the medical school
three weeks ago but remains on staff, said the overseers had no
role in hospital affairs.
   He said that during the twice-a-year overseers' meetings Souter
``never mentioned the word abortion nor was the question raised
during any meetings.''

   Engineers and photographers from the United
States, Japan, West Germany and Britain have begun a
high-technology investigation into what causes the mysterious
circles that appear suddenly among crops in England and elsewhere
in Europe.
   Equipped with $1.8 million worth of heat-seeking cameras and
other sophisticated gear, they will be watching fields in the
southwest county of Wiltshire for the next three weeks.
   They will try to capture on film whatever it is that flattens
crops in decorative patters of perfectly formed circles, some with
concentric rings, and other shapes.
   The circles have been variously attributed to whirlwinds,
witches, magnetic forces, animals, hoaxers and spaceships.
   Team members are using light and sound equipment to try to
locate the source in the Vale of Pewsey, a hilly district dividing
Wiltshire between Salisbury Plain and the Marlborough Downs, 75
miles southwest of London.
   The circles were recorded in England as far back as 1678, but
circles which appeared in a Vale of Pewsey wheat field last week
were more elaborate than usual. The circles were linked and some
had flattened straight areas like arms projecting from them.
   In other countries, circles have been reported in sand, snow and
rice paddies.
   Colin Andrews, coordinator of the watch which began on Monday,
said: ``This is a determined effort to secure on high-quality film
the full event _ whatever that event will ultimately turn out to
be.''
   Amateur photographers who spent a night in the area last year
saw nothing, but in the morning they found circles in a field
behind them.

<HEAD>Bush Promises to Tone Down Attacks in Budget Deficit War</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with session for over for the day. ADDS quotes. Edits

<TEXT>
   President Bush and congressional Democrats
agreed during a two-hour budget session Tuesday to tone down
political attacks, but failed to narrow crucial differences on
curing the federal deficit.
   At a later meeting, administration officials and congressional
leaders of both parties failed again to agree to the overall size
and components of the cuts they would make in next year's budget.
But House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said the two
sides could agree to the overall outline of a package by Wednesday.
   ``It's not as easy as it looks,'' Gephardt said.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
confirmed that the general consensus of the negotiators remained a
package of about $50 billion in savings for next year, divided
about evenly between tax increases and spending cuts. The
bargainers have informally been using those numbers for several
weeks.
   The sides agreed to a political cease-fire after Bush blistered
Democrats last week at fund-raising events around the country, and
Democrats responded in kind.
   ``He'll be very gentle'' from now on, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said of Bush.
   ``We need to concentrate on reducing partisan comments,'' said
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., adding that the peace pact
applied to political campaign committees as well as individuals.
   At a midday speech to a GOP audience in Philadelphia, Bush said
he saluted ``those Democrats in the leadership who are now working
with me'' in reaching a budget agreement.
   However, he renewed his appeal for a constitutional amendment to
balance the budget, saying it would end what he called an ``budget
charade'' and ``fiscal follies'' in Congress.
   He also said that spending was ``out of control'' in
``Democrat-controlled House appropriations bills.''
   Asked about Bush's remarks, Gephardt said: ``The president has
to decide, all of us have to decide, if we want to bring this
budget summit to a conclusion.''
   A participant in Tuesday's budget bargaining, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said no substantial progress was made.
   ``All the White House wants to talk about are entitlement cuts
and domestic discretionary spending,'' the negotiator said.
   Entitlements are federal benefit programs such as Social
Security and Medicare. The administration wants to cut those
programs by about $14 billion, while Democrats would like to limit
the reductions to $10 billion or less.
   Domestic discretionary programs cover general government
initiatives such as environmental clean-ups and air traffic
control. Republicans are more interested in cutting such programs
than are Democrats.
   ``One of the things discussed today was to stop the political
debate and start the substantive debate and to try to cut down on
the political comment that's gone on on all sides,'' Gephardt said.
   ``I think you're going to see that that will happen,'' he added.
``I think a lot of that's out of everybody's system.''
   In political speeches last week, Bush ridiculed the budget
process and suggested that it was the Democrats' turn to make
concessions on taxes and spending.
   Fitzwater told reporters on Air Force One en route to
Philadelphia that Bush and the Democrats were ``working in a spirit
of harmony and compromise.''
   ``They agreed this morning at the meeting that they would try to
keep the rhetoric under control and really try to make this a
productive week of work,'' Fitzwater said.
   Another White House session with the five top congressional
leaders _ Gephardt, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, Foley and House Minority Leader Bob
Michel _ was scheduled for Wednesday morning.
   At the same time, a larger group of budget negotiators was
meeting on Capitol Hill Tuesday in an effort to narrow differences.
   Despite the political truce, Bush and Congress seemed no closer
to agreeing on a way to close the deficit gap than they were before
the president revoked his 1988 ``no new taxes'' pledge in early
July.
   The administration estimates that the deficit for fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1, will be nearly $169 billion _ more than $100
billion over the $64 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law.
   Foley, D-Wash., said decisions remain on the precise amount of
deficit reduction that would be sought and how much of it would
come from new taxes and spending cuts.
   ``I don't think there is at this point a clear definition of
what each side wants,'' Foley told reporters.
   Noting Monday's 56-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial
average, Gephardt said: ``All through this I think people have been
worried that the market is very touchy and the whole economy is
very shaky.

   A CIA-linked airline would remain a target of a
$135 million lawsuit filed by an American mercenary embroiled in
the Iran-Contra scandal, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   Jury selection in the lawsuit filed by Eugene Hasenfus against
retired Gen. Richard Secord and Miami-based Southern Air Transport
was scheduled to begin Wednesday.
   Hasenfus, a cargo handler, or ``kicker,'' aboard a C-123
secretly supplying the Nicaraguan rebels, was captured after
Nicaraguan troops shot down the plane in October 1986.
   He was the only survivor of the crash, which revealed details
about U.S. government involvement in the flights. The Reagan
administration later admitted that profits from arms sales to Iran
were diverted to the Contras, despite a congressional ban on U.S.
military aid to the rebels who sought to overthrow the leftist
Nicaraguan government.
   The Sandinista government held Hasenfus, of Marinette, Wis., for
about three months.
   In 1988, Hasenfus sued Secord and Southern Air, an airline once
owned by the CIA and which continued to work under contract with
the U.S. government.
   The family of a crewman who died aboard the plane, Wallace
Sawyer Jr., has joined Hasenfus in a parallel suit that will be
tried at the same time.
   Southern Air denies participating in the Contra supply operation.
   However, Senior U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins ruled to
keep the airline as a defendant.
   ``That was a good ruling for us, and it was a fair ruling,''
said Hasenfus' attorney Marc Sarnoff.
   Southern Air attorney David Kirstein said the ruling would limit
the scope of the case to a contract dispute rather than a review of
the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``Now it won't be a free-for-all,'' Kirstein said.
   Atkins also dropped a wrongful death claim from the Sawyer
family suit, but allowed negligence claims to stand.
   Both Hasenfus and Wallace Sawyer Sr., father of the dead
co-pilot, refused to comment Tuesday.
   The lawsuit claims Hasenfus was recruited in 1986 through the
Pennsylvania airline Corporate Air Services and William Cooper, a
Southern Air pilot.
   Cooper, who also died in the crash, led Hasenfus to believe
``the Contra resupply operation was being run `right out of the
back door of the White House''' by former Reagan administration
aide Oliver North, Secord and Southern Air, according to the
lawsuit.
   Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded guilty to
lying to congressional investigators and was sentenced in January
to two years' probation.
   The lawsuit claims Secord misrepresented the nature of the
flights and failed to take routine safety precautions.
   Hasenfus said he was led to believe he was working for Southern
Air through its subsidiary Corporate Air, on behalf of the U.S.
government. In reality, the lawsuit claims, Secord was engaged in a
profit-making scheme.
   The lawsuit also describes the plane as ``wholly inadequate and
dilapidated,'' lacking such basic safety equipment as parachutes.
   Secord's attorneys describe Hasenfus as a mercenary _ earning
about $3,000 a month _ who knew the risks associated with the
flight.
   North and Elliot Abrams, former assistant secretary of state for
Latin American Affairs, gave depositions for the trial. Expected to
testify is Felix Rodriguez, the CIA official who ran the Contra
supply operation out of El Salvador.

   At 3:30 p.m. Monday President Bush summoned
aides to the Oval Office and asked how quickly they could call a
news conference. He wanted to announce his Supreme Court nominee
that afternoon.
   Told they could be ready by 4:30 p.m., Bush said, ``I'd like
another half-hour'' because he needed more time to make up his
mind, a senior administration official said Tuesday.
   This official, who accompanied Bush on a campaign trip Tuesday,
recalled events this way. He spoke with reporters on condition that
his name not be used.
   Bush had spent much of Monday afternoon interviewing the two
finalists for the high court vacancy, both federal appellate
judges: Edith Jones, 41, of Houston, and David Souter, 50, of
Concord, N.H.
   A third circuit court judge, Lawrence Silberman of Washington,
had been ruled out of the running Sunday night, according to the
source, who asked not to be identified.
   Souter had been summoned to Washington Sunday night, spending
the night in the home of J. Michael Luttig, a Justice Department
lawyer whom he had never met before. Luttig is an acting assistant
attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel.
   Bush headed into his living quarters at the White House after
saying goodbye to the president of Ecuador Monday afternoon. There
Bush spent 45 minutes interviewing Souter, whom he placed on the
1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston just three months ago.
   White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray had already grilled Souter
that morning about whether there was anything in his background
that might prove embarrassing, such as the marijuana use that
forced Douglas Ginsburg to withdraw as a Reagan administration
nominee to the Supreme Court in 1987.
   Souter's answers ``were all satisfactory,'' the source said.
   Bush filled three yellow legal-sized pages with notes on Souter,
under the heading ``plusses and minuses.''
   He then returned to the West Wing, or business side of the White
House, to interview Jones.
   Afterwards, both candidates cooled their heels elsewhere in the
White House while Bush made up his mind. Souter was in the office
of Andrew Card, the deputy White House chief of staff.
   At 4:15 p.m. Bush summoned his press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, to the Oval Office.
   ``I have selected Judge Souter. Here's the bio. Where's the
judge?'' the president asked. They agreed to proceed with a 5 p.m.
announcement in the White House briefing room, and Fitzwater told
reporters clustered outside his office that the president would be
having a news conference with his nominee.
   Bush had filled out 2{ more pages of his thoughts about the
selection, concluding that Souter was the right person for the job.
   ``The president was impressed by the fact that he's a humble
man, quiet, studious,'' the official said. ``You get a sense of
confidence that here's a serious person that's truly a student of
the law.''
   Bush called Souter into his private study next to the Oval
Office to offer him the job. Souter said he would be honored.
   ``There's also a feeling this is a guy who wants to be a Supreme
Court justice and is willing to devote his life to it,'' the
official said.
   Souter, with an evident five o'clock shadow, was ``really kind
of dazed'' when the walked into the briefing room with Bush.
   ``He doesn't know beans about a press conference,'' the official
said.
   Souter had been told to expect to say a few words, but not to
take questions. Bush didn't give the judge a chance until Fitzwater
slipped the president a note several questions into the news
conference.
   When Justice William J. Brennan Jr. announced his surprise
resignation Friday, Bush was prepared.
   ``The president had been advised there would be an opportunity
to name someone to the court in all likelihood in his first term,''
the official said.
   Also, ``it became clear that some of the special interests,
particularly abortion and a few others, were going to try to build
a public stew for this nominee to be dumped into'' if Bush failed
to move quickly, the official said.
   After the announcement, the president, Souter, Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh, Gray, and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu
walked back to the Oval Office to watch television coverage.
   Souter called his mother at a nursing home in Concord and
eventually spent the night at the home of John Schmidtz, a deputy
White House counsel.

<HEAD>Scouting Makes Strong Comeback in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boy Scout and Girl Scout movements are making a
strong comeback in Eastern Europe after decades of Communist
repression, the World Organization of the Scout Movement said
Tuesday after readmitting Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Scouting officials attending the 32nd World Conference of
Scouting also received encouraging news about the prospects for the
movement's revival in the Soviet Union, where Communist-controlled
youth leagues replaced the pre-revolutionary scouting groups.
   In a letter read at the conference Tuesday, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev praised the ``noble objectives'' of the
scouting movement.
   He also thanked the world organization for helping 1,235 youths
from the region around the stricken Chernobyl nuclear power plant
spend summer vacations in Western Europe.
   Gorbachev's letter was read by Albert Lichanov, president of the
Soviet Children's Fund. He said the Soviet Union no longer sought
to prevent the formation of independent youth organizations.
   ``More and more scouting movements exist,'' he said.
   Jacques Moreillon, secretary general of the world organization,
said the Soviets had given ``a green light for the rebirth of
scouting'' in the U.S.S.R.
   Scouting's status in Eastern Europe was a major topic during the
first full day of the weeklong conference, which has brought
together about 1,000 officials of national scouting organizations
in more than 100 countries.
   ``In the past two years, there has been a spectacular renewal of
scouting in Eastern Europe ... a spontaneous, intense movement,''
the world organization said in a memorandum distributed at the
conference.
   The conference opened Monday night with a welcoming message from
President Francois Mitterrand.
   Mitterrand saluted the scouting movement's ``universality'' and
said its renaissance in Eastern Europe ``shows that scouting
doesn't exist without democracy.''
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia were among several countries accepted
this week as members of the world organization. Others include
Guinea, Comoros and newly independent Namibia.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia had scouting programs until the
1950s, when they were suppressed by Communist authorities. The
programs survived clandestinely, with occasional brief periods of
legalization, until restrictions were lifted in 1988.
   Hungary now has about 10,000 Scouts, and Czechoslovakia more
than 70,000, according to the World Scout Bureau. It also
summarized the past and present status of scouting elsewhere in
Eastern Europe:
   _The Soviet Union: There were nearly 100,000 scouts prior to
1917, but the movement was suppressed after the Bolshevik
revolution. Now, scouting has revived in the Baltic republics, and
the formation of scouting groups elsewhere is considered likely.
   _Poland: An active scouting program existed before World War II.
In postwar years, the movement dropped out of the world
organization, but an initiative began in March to qualify for
readmission through policy reforms.
   _East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria: Scouting movements in these
countries were persecuted systematically by the Nazis and their
allies in the 1930s, and never were re-established fully. East
Germany's program is expected to merge with West Germany's after
unification. But in Bulgaria and Romania, the World Scout Bureau
said, ``there are still great difficulties to overcome.''
   The bureau is the central office for the World Organization of
the Scout Movement, which represents about 16 million Scouts in 150
countries and territories.
   The largest scouting movements are in the United States with 3.9
million Scouts, the Philippines and Indonesia with about 2 million,
India with 1.2 million and Britain with 681,000.

<TEXT>
   Five super sleuths on a train bound for New York
were expecting trouble even as they left the station. Before they
reach their final destination, someone will die. It's up to them to
find out whodunnit.
   A real-life murder mystery? Not quite. It's the first-ever U.S.
CLUE championship, where amateur sleuths vie at the classic
detective game created in 1947, which challenges players to figure
out which of six characters commits the murder that starts the game.
   All the characters of the game turned out Tuesday afternoon for
the one-day trip aboard the luxurious American-European Express.
Miss Scarlet promenaded in a revealing black number; Professor Plum
looked dapper in a brilliant purple dinner jacket and Col. Mustard
strutted in his pith helmet.
   As the host welcomed his guests at the train station, a scream
filled the air.
   ``Somebody's been shot!'' Miss Scarlet said.
   ``Danger! Danger on the train!'' cried Mrs. White, the maid, as
she waved her purple dust whisk where Mr. Boddy lay sprawled on the
carpet, blood pouring from his head.
   The ``Case of the Dead Boddy'' was under way.
   Which of the six characters was the killer? The sultry Miss
Scarlet with a wrench? Rich Mr. Green with a gun? Dowdy Mrs.
Peacock with a candlestick? The sleuths had 24 hours to find out _
and before they did, another murder was to take place.
   Unlike in the board game, where each player takes on the persona
of one of the color-themed characters in the mystery, Tuesday's
contestants watched actors portray Mr. Mustard, Miss Scarlet and
the others. They also got to ask the characters questions.
   Busily taking notes, watching everything, the five contestants
had little time to speak to reporters about the crime.
   ``How do I know you're who you say you are?'' photographer
Sharon Dennison of Burbank, Calif., asked, watching in suspicion as
a reporter reached into his jacket for identification.
   The contestants, who were chosen based on 250-word mysteries
they wrote, were to complete three rounds of play, tallying points
as they went along.
   The first round was a traditional board game of CLUE held at the
train station. The trail for clues then took the detectives to
Chicago's WaterTower Place shopping mall, where each jealously
guarded his or her finds.
   ``This is great fun,'' said Katie Anders of New York City.
   ``When I was a kid, all my friends were watching cartoons. I was
watching `I Led Three Lives,''' said Anders, a real-life mystery
writer.
   The person who gathered the most clues at WaterTower would
receive the second-round points. The contestants, who also included
a retired judge, a playwright and the owner of an electronics
company, were to compete for more points on the overnight train
ride by questioning characters, observing clues in different cars,
and then guessing the killer and his or her motive.
   Before the train pulled into Grand Central Station on Wednesday
afternoon, the criminal would be revealed, and the contestant with
the most points would be crowned winner, giving that person a
chance to compete in an international CLUE tournament in Europe in
September.
   Officials at Parker Brothers, which sponsored the interactive
murder mystery, were hush-hush about who the murderer was, but Mrs.
White was heard to remark, ``I can't imagine any of us hurting a
fly.''

<HEAD>Lawyer Emerges from Hiding for Meeting with President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer who had been threatened with
arrest for his links to the campaign for multiparty democracy
emerged from hiding Tuesday to hold what he termed a ``positive''
meeting with President Daniel arap Moi.
   The lawyer, Paul Muite, said Moi criticized some of his views
during their wide-ranging 40-minute discussion at the president's
official residence, but added that overall the meeting was cordial.
   Muite said Moi told him he was free to return to work.
   The talks come one day after Muite issued a statement calling
for the release of political detainees. He also denied involvement
in recent politically inspired riots in which at least 28 people
died.
   Moi on Sunday accused Muite of fomenting the violence and urged
him to come out of hiding and apologize in person.
   Muite went underground July 5, one day after two of his clients,
former Cabinet ministers Charles Rubia and Kenneth Matiba, were
detained under security statutes that allow them to be held
indefinitely without charge.
   The politicians had been at the forefront of the campaign to
legalize opposition parties.
   Following the arrest of Rubia and Matiba, 15 other people linked
to the democracy campaign were arrested.
   Muite said Moi's only mention of the political detainees was to
say ``that he does not take any pleasure in detaining people.''
   ``I thought that was very positive,'' Muite told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.
   Moi has come under criticism at home and abroad for the
detentions of the pro-democracy activists and his government's
handling of the recent riots in Nairobi and other cities.
   More than 1,400 people were charged in connection with the July
7-10 riots in which mobs of stone-throwing youths clashed with
police, stores were looted and vehicles burned.
   The rioting broke out and spread after police used tear gas and
gunfire to disperse a pro-democracy rally in Nairobi.
   The rally had been proposed by Matiba and Rubia, the leaders of
a loose alliance of prominent Kenyans who accused the government of
widespread corruption and election rigging and called for political
change.
   Kenya banned its last opposition party in 1969. Kenya became a
one-party state by law in 1982.
   Moi has rejected calls for political pluralism, claiming it
could lead to tribal-based parties and possibly warfare.

   A federal judge stopped the Justice
Department's anti-pornography unit from prosecuting a mail-order
distributor of sexually-oriented magazines and videos in more than
one jurisdiction.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green issued the preliminary
injunction on Monday after finding evidence to suggest that federal
prosecutors had investigated PHE, Inc. with the intention of
forcing the North Carolina company, also known as ``Adam and Eve,''
out of business.
   The allegations by the company, and its owner, Philip D. Harvey,
``suggest a concerted effort ... through harassment and threats of
multiple prosecution, to suppress plaintiffs' constitutionally
protected activities,'' the judge said.
   She issued a preliminary injunction barring the Justice
Department from bringing charges in more than one federal
jurisdiction at one time.
   Bruce Ennis, who represented the company, said the Justice
Department's National Obscenity Enforcement Unit has pursued a
strategy of trying to wear down the financial resources of sexually
oriented businesses by threatening to bring a series of indictments
in numerous jurisdictions.
   He said Green's ruling ``casts a real cloud over the National
Obscenity Enforcement Unit's new tactic of threatening multiple
indictments as a way of coercing adult materials distributors to go
out of business.''
   Ennis presented evidence that the Justice Department used
similar tactics to force Pak Ventures, another distributor of adult
magazines and videos, to go out of business.
   In her ruling, Green noted that ``it is not without significance
that defendants have not contested, disputed, or refuted any of the
factual assertions contained in the declarations presented by
plaintiffs.''
   ``Taken as a whole, these allegations suggest a concerted effort
by the defendants, through harassment and threats of multiple
prosecutions, to suppress plaintiffs' constitutionally protected
activities.''
   ``Intrusive and intimidating'' searches of the company's
Carrboro, N.C. offices, and ``the admitted desire to get Harvey
`out of business' substantiate plaintiffs' allegations of bad
faith,'' Green ruled.
   Federal prosecutors in Utah and the western district of Kentucky
had threatened to bring charges against Adam and Eve.
   Earlier threats were made in the eastern district of North
Carolina, even though the FBI had advised prosecutors that the
materials distributed by PHE were not obscene by bureau standards,
according to the ruling.
   In 1988, another federal judge issued a similar injunction to
bar multiple prosecutions of Avram Freedberg and his Stamford,
Conn., company. Freedberg ultimately entered a guilty plea, agreed
to get out of the mail-order business and dropped his lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   A Red Cross relief team crossed police
barricades and distributed relief supplies Tuesday to the Mohawks
at Oka, the second such convoy since an armed standoff began July
11 between Indians and Quebec police.
   Efforts to end the confrontation have stalled. The dispute arose
over attempts to expand a golf course onto what natives say is
ancestral land. One policeman has been killed, but responsibility
in the death has not been fixed.
   The Mohawks of Kanasetake refused conditions set Monday by the
Quebec government for resuming negotiations.
   Red Cross official Linda Gauthier said the agency distributed
milk, bread, bananas, oranges, laundry soap, sanitary napkins and
toilet paper on Tuesday and hopes to be able to check on the
situation every two or three days.
   She had made a spot check in Indian territory Monday night and
other food or medical supplies did not appear to be needed. Ms.
Gauthier said no one was starving but there are ``vulnerable''
people who need regular medical monitoring.
   She said the Red Cross now needs written agreement by all
parties in the dispute before each visit, and is trying to
negotiate a blanket agreement that will allow regular trips into
Kanasetake every three or four days.
   The Kanasetake Mohawks have drawn support from other Indians
across Canada, including roadblocks in British Columbia and a
blockade by other Mohawks of the Mercier Bridge into Montreal, 18
miles from Oka.
   The federal government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney so far
has left it up to Quebec provincial authorities to resolve the
dispute.
   The Mohawks demanded that Mulroney's government become involved
and also appealed to President Bush and the United Nations, among
others.
   A representative of the Mohawks, Atsenhaienton, also known as
Kenneth Deer, was in Europe to gain international attention for the
confrontation. He planned to visit embassies in Geneva to ask for
economic sanctions on Canada.
   He will argue that Canada's treatment of aboriginal people is on
a par with South Africa's treatment of blacks, the Toronto Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Among Mohawk demands are that the golf club development be
abandoned at once; that police withdraw; that shipments of food,
clothing, medical supplies and the like be freely allowed behind
Indian lines, and that observers from either the United Nations or
Amnesty International be brought in.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Calls Credit Union Sex Scandal A Hoax</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A story of sexual abuse, prostitution and
judicial bribery told to a legislative committee investigating an
Omaha credit union failure was ``a carefully crafted hoax,'' a
grand jury said Tuesday.
   In a 42-page report, the Douglas County grand jury debunked many
of the rumors that have surrounded the 1988 failure of the Franklin
Community Federal Credit Union.
   Besides its report, the grand jury also issued three
indictments, two of them charging perjury against witnesses who
claimed to the Legislature that they were victims.
   A federal grand jury also is investigating Franklin-related
matters. The county grand jury said it decided that financial
matters, including a fund shortage of about $39 million, were best
left to the federal grand jury.
   ``Perhaps never in the history of Douglas County has the
discordant multitude played so feverishly upon the rumor pipe as in
the allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding Franklin,'' the
grand jury report said.
   In the wake of the Franklin collapse, allegations and rumors
arose of sexual abuse of children, of an adult male homosexual
prostitution ring, of drug use and cult activities, some involving
prominent citizens.
   The grand jury cited many prominent residents by name and
cleared them of wrongdoing. Its report indicated that the names may
have been raised in rumors because of their prominence.
   The grand jury said it found ``no credible evidence of child
sexual abuse, interstate transportation of minors, drug trafficking
or participation in a pornography ring'' by former Franklin manager
Lawrence E. King Jr., or other Franklin officials and employees.
   King, a prominent businessman who sang the national anthem at
the 1984 Republican National Convention, still faces 40 counts in
federal court of conspiracy, fraud and federal income tax evasion.
   He is accused of diverting money for personal use. He was ruled
incompetent to stand trial and is receiving psychiatric treatment.
   Those indicted by the grand jury included Alisha J. Owen and
Paul A. Bonacci, who had claimed they were victims and gave
videotaped statements to the special legislative committee
investigating Franklin-related matters.
   ``There is no doubt, after reviewing all relevant evidence, that
the story of sexual abuse, drugs, prostitution, and judicial
bribery presented in the legislative videotapes is a carefully
crafted hoax, scripted by a person or persons with considerable
knowledge of the people and institutions of Omaha,'' the grand jury
report said.
   Ms. Owen, 21, of Omaha, was charged with eight counts of perjury
and Bonacci, 22, also of Omaha, was indicted on three counts of
perjury.
   The grand jury also handed up an indictment charging two counts
of pandering against Alan A. Baer, 67, an Omaha businessman who
once owned an Omaha-based department store chain.
   The indictment accused Baer of giving something of value to two
males to become a prostitute or commit an act of prostitution. But
the grand jury reported it didn't find any connection between Baer
and the credit union.
   Its report said many of the allegations made against Baer were
false and ``it appears Baer was written into the script because of
his wealth ...''
   Baer's office referred calls to his attorney, Steve Seline, who
stressed that Baer was cleared of any sexual exploitation of
minors. Seline said the pandering charges against Baer, which
involved adults, were ``incorrect and inappropriate.''
   Ms. Owen is serving time in the Nebraska Center for Women in
York for writing bad checks. She was declining all interviews, said
Lawrence Wayne, superintendent of the women's prison.
   Her attorney, Henry C. Rosenthal Jr., was out of town and
unavailable for comment Tuesday, his Omaha office said.
   Bonacci is serving time in the Lincoln Correctional Center for
sexually assaulting a boy and could not be reached for comment
Tuesday.
   The grand jury reported it hadn't found any evidence to support
allegations against former Omaha World-Herald publisher Harold
Andersen. In March, Andersen acknowledged he had been named in the
rumors, and said he had done nothing improper.
   ``The grand jury found no evidence to support allegations that
Harold Andersen was involved in sexual misconduct of other illegal
activity,'' said the grand jury report.
   Andersen's only connection with Franklin was as co-chair of the
fund-raising committee for a new credit union building. The motive
for naming him ``was probably politically generated due to his
position as publisher of the Omaha World-Herald at that time,'' it
said.
   The grand jury said Michael Casey, a former Omaha resident who
has described himself as an investigative free-lance reporter,
helped spread the rumors.
   Casey, 45, was arrested Monday on a South Dakota warrant for
allegedly writing an insufficient-fund check 23 months ago. The
arrest came less than an hour after he finished testifying before
the federal grand jury in Omaha.
   The county grand jury report said Casey became fascinated with
the Franklin case and ``endeavored to cover the `real' Franklin
story, listening to street rumors, spending time with members of
Omaha's gay community, and seeking out potential victim-witnesses.''

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Asks Museum to Describe Planned Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts has asked an
outpost of avant-garde art to provide a detailed description of its
upcoming season within 30 days or face a loss of funding, both
parties said Tuesday.
   The endowment called it a routine request. But the Franklin
Furnace Archives, a Manhattan museum that presents experimental
performance and visual art, described it as ``harassment'' aimed at
performances some consider obscene.
   ``The NEA is making this request because the Furnace's whole
purpose on this earth is to show avant-garde art,'' said Barbara
Pollack, the museum's spokeswoman. Such art ``doesn't fit in with
(Sen. Jesse) Helms' definition of what should receive funding,''
she added.
   The four performance artists whom the NEA turned down for grants
in June have performed at Franklin Furnace or received funding from
it, Pollack said. And an installation by Karen Finley, one of the
four, is currently on display at the organization's gallery.
   In one of her performance pieces, Finley dances nude and smears
her body with chocolate to show the degradation of women.
   Martha Wilson, founder and director of Franklin Furnace, was
traveling and unavailable for comment on the endowment's request.
   The request came after Franklin Furnace was notified in early
June that the NEA had approved a $20,000 grant for its visual and
performing arts programs and a $7,500 grant for audience
development.
   The museum accepted the grant, signing the anti-obscenity pledge
the NEA requires of grantees. Congress last year put strings on
government aid to the arts by adding language to a 1990 spending
bill that forbids the endowment from funding works that might be
deemed obscene.
   In a letter dated July 13 but received Monday, the NEA asked
Franklin Furnace for ``identification of the artists involved and
the nature of the work to be performed or installed'' in order to
make a ``final determination'' on its grant application.
   Failure to respond to the request within 30 days ``will result
in the rejection of this application,'' Julianne R. Davis, the
endowment's general counsel, wrote to Franklin Furnace.
   The NEA's request was first reported in The Philadelphia
Inquirer on Tuesday.
   In a statement Tuesday, Davis said, ``A number of endowment
programs have, for many years, routinely required the submission of
additional information at appropriate times.''
   Many arts organizations have not fully booked their upcoming
season when they apply for grants, and it is not unusual for the
NEA to later request a description of what is planned, said Kathy
Christie, an endowment spokeswoman.
   Pollack is suspicious, however. She cited a June 21 call from
the General Accounting Office asking for information on four
performance artists, including Finley. She said the GAO had been
asked by Helms, the Republican senator from North Carolina, in
March to look into ``possible violations of law by the NEA.''
   Now, she said, ``What they want to do is get a broader list of
who to investigate. We do not want to assist them in developing a
blacklist.''

<HEAD>Nicaragua Recovers 10 Red Eye Missiles from Former Contras</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandinista police recovered 10
surface-to-air Red Eye missiles from former rebels, Interior
Minister Carlos Hurtado said Tuesday, a sign that the Contra
guerrillas kept some weapons when they demobilized.
   Hurtado, in charge of police and security forces, also said two
armed men captured Saturday admit being members of the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front, the Salvadoran guerrilla alliance.
   He told a news conference at the foreign correspondents' club
that the two would be turned over to a third country but did not
elaborate.
   Police on Monday recovered three of the heat-seeking missiles in
Ciudad Rama and the other seven in El Almendro.
   Both towns are in southeastern Nicaragua and El Almendro is the
heart of one of the development centers the former rebels have been
promised.
   Hurtado did not say whether arrests were made or give details on
how the missiles were recovered except to say they had been held by
former Contras.
   By the time the Contras disarmed in mid-June, they had turned in
more than 100 Red Eyes, among thousands of other weapons.
   But it has been estimated that before the United States stopped
military aid to the guerrillas in February 1989, it gave the
Contras about 400 Red Eyes.
   Hurtado said the 10 missiles would be turned over to a United
Nations mission supervising regional peace accords, including
Contra demobilization, and would be destroyed.
   Despite Contra demobilization after President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro took office April 25, thousands of weapons remain in
private hands.
   The outgoing Sandinistas turned over huge quantities to their
supporters before leaving office. The new government asked that the
weapons be turned in but made no move to force the issue.
   Sandinistas still dominate the army and police force.
   Hurtado said police have intercepted 1,100 pounds of cocaine
since Mrs. Chamorro became president. He said drug traffickers seem
to be taking advantage of peacetime conditions in Nicaragua to use
the country as a transfer point.

   Cigarette vending machines would be banned
from stores, fast-food outlets and most other public places under a
measure approved Tuesday by the City Council.
   The ordinance, intended to make it harder for minors to get
cigarettes, goes to Mayor Sophie Masloff, who has 10 days to sign
or veto it. As a member of council in 1987, she cast the deciding
vote for an ordinance banning smoking in most public places in the
city.
   The measure, approved 7-1 by the council, bans cigarette vending
machines except in bars and private clubs, factories, private
businesses, offices or ``other private facilities not open to the
general public.''
   Places affected by the ban include grocery and retail stores,
fast-food and family restaurants, service stations, bus stations,
sports arenas and hotels.
   Institutions such as hospitals and universities can have
cigarette machines in areas that are open only to to employees.
   Councilman Gene Ricciardi, who opposed the measure, said the
bill would place ``an additional burden on the small business
owner.''

   NASA and rocket builder General

Atlas carrying a government scientific satellite.
   Liftoff was scheduled for 3:21 p.m. from Cape Canaveral Air

   Workers on Tuesday replaced a bad switch, which was designed to
switch the rocket from external electrical power to its own
batteries.
   Monday's launch attempt was called off after the Atlas failed to

   Bad weather forced postponement of Sunday's launch attempt,
while a helium leak was responsible for Friday's unsuccessful try.
   The rocket's payload, the $189 million Combined Release and

The satellite is designed to illuminate Earth's normally invisible
magnetic field lines.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
take up with his Soviet counterpart hints from Moscow of a
readiness to make a deal aimed at ending the 12-year-old civil war
in Afghanistan, an administration official said Tuesday.
   But the official disputed a report from Moscow by ABC News that
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Baker already
had cut a deal.
   Baker leaves Wednesday on a four-nation trip to Asia. He is
scheduled to meet Shevardnadze in the Soviet Siberian city of
Irkutsk on Aug. 1.
   The Soviets have not yet conveyed to the United States how
Afghan President Najibullah might be removed from power in Kabul,
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   For weeks the Bush administration has hoped for a breakthrough
to end to war between Afghan government forces armed by the Soviet
Union and a guerrilla coalition fighting with American-supplied
weapons funnelled through Pakistan.
   But the Soviets failed this month to send a delegation to
Washington for talks on the major obstacle to a settlement based on
a cease-fire and elections _ that is, when Najibullah should yield
power. Both sides already have reached a tacit agreement that
Najibullah would play no role in the new government and would step
down at some point before his successor take over.
   ``The Soviets hinted at a deal; they haven't fleshed it out,''
the official said. ``The thread of the deal is going to be pursued
in Irkutsk by Baker.''
   Administration officials did not find fault with Moscow for not
sending the delegation to Washington. They said they thought the
Kremlin was simply preoccupied with the 28th Communist Party
Congress at the time.
   But when Baker saw Shevardnadze in Paris last Wednesday, again
there was no major development on the Afghan front, the official
said.
   The Soviet Union installed the Najibullah government in 1979,
but the government in Kabul has been unable to impose its will on
the countryside. The Soviets withdrew their troops last year but
continued arms supply.
   Both superpowers have grown weary of the effort to defeat the
other side's client in Afghanistan. The Senate Intelligence
Committee, according to congressional sources, reflected this
disenchantment Tuesday in voting for a cut about $100 million in
the current $300 million annual aid for Afghan rebels.
   In a report attributed to unspecified western diplomatic
sources, ABC said the Baker-Shevardnadze agreement called for an
end to arms supplies for both sides. The United States had
abandoned its position that Najibullah must go.
   The official who spoke with The Associated Press called the
network report ``premature.''
   The 2\-hour Paris meeting was dominated by Cambodia. Afterward,
Baker, announced that the United States had withdrawn its
diplomatic support from a rebel coalition that included the Khmer
Rouge and would hold talks with Vietnam, supporter of the
government in Phnom Penh and an ally of the Soviet Union.
   The State Department announced Tuesday that Kenneth Quinn, a
deputy assistant secretary, will meet with Vietnam's ambassador to
the United Nations in New York on Aug. 6.
   On his Asia trip Baker will also attend a meeting of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Indonesia; hold talks in
Singapore and visit to outer Mongolia after seeing Shevardnadze.

<TEXT>
   Cable TV magnate Ted Turner on Tuesday named
former Los Angeles Times publisher Tom Johnson as the new president
of his Cable News Network, effective Aug. 1.
   Johnson called himself ``a strong champion of hard news'' who
will try to expand CNN's overseas bureaus. He will succeed Burt
Reinhardt, 70, CNN's president since 1982, who has been with the
network since its start ten years ago.
   Johnson, who joined the Times in 1977 and now is its chairman
and vice-chairman of the parent Times Mirror Co., said he'd first
spoken with Turner about the new job less than a month ago.
   Johnson, whom Turner said was introduced to him by a mutual
friend, said that during his first six weeks at work he'd just
listen and learn. He plans no sweeping changes at CNN, he added:
   ``I am not a believer in Saturday night massacres. I believe in
working with the people who are in place.''
   He and Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting
System, spoke at a telephone news conference from Seattle, site of
the Goodwill Games sports festival that TBS is sponsoring at a
possible loss of $26 million.
   Turner said he made the change because Rheinhardt is 70 ``and
everybody's got to retire some time.''
   Turner emphasized that he has no plans to sell CNN, nor any
plans ``to merge or jointly gather news with any other U.S. news
organizations.''
   NBC several years ago proposed buying part of CNN, but backed
out when Turner refused to give up editorial control of the 24-hour
news organization.
   Johnson, a former White House fellow, was President Johnson's
special assistant in 1968. He was the Times' publisher for nine
years until succeeded last August by David Laventhol, president of
Times Mirror Co.
   Johnson said he's leaving the Times because ``quite frankly, it
was time for a change...I'm looking forward to getting back to
running a media organization.
   ``I feel much more comfortable in a quarterback role than I do a
coaching role,'' he said, alluding to his current jobs in Los
Angeles.
   Asked about his seeming lack of TV experience, Johnson noted
that others have made the transition from print to broadcasting,
including Walter Cronkite and Richard C. Wald, a senior ABC News
execuutive and former NBC News president.
   He also said that he has some experience in broadcasting, having
worked for two years as executive vice president of Texas
Broadcasting Corp., whose holdings included station KBTC-TV in
Austin.
   The company was owned by Lyndon Johnson's family until the
former president's death in 1973.
   CNN says it has 1,700 full and part-time staffers, is seen in 55
million U.S. homes, and has viewers in 90 countries.
   Reinhardt, who CNN says plans to retire later, will become vice
chairman of CNN and advise Johnson during a transition period.
   Johnson also will serve as Turner Broadcasting System's vice
president for news and as a member of TBS' executive committee. He
will report directly to Turner.

<HEAD>Iran Seeks Compensation, Damages from U.S. in Airbus Downing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran asked the World Court on
Tuesday for punitive damages and compensation from the U.S.
government for the July 3, 1988, downing of an Iranian commercial
jetliner by a U.S. Navy missile.
   The 300-page brief, termed a memorial in World Court parlance,
apparently set no monetary figures. All 290 people aboard the
Airbus were killed.
   Iran also asked the court to order the United States to refrain
from violating international law, and rebuked the U.S. government
for its continued naval presence in the Persian Gulf.
   The Airbus was hit by a missile from the U.S.S. Vincennes, part
of a task force in the gulf during the Iran-Iraq war. The jet,
bound from Bandar Abbas to Dubai, was mistaken as an attacking
warplane in the closing days of the war.
   Investigations showed the plane was in a normal climbing pattern
when hit.
   Iran also submitted three volumes of exhibits.
   It sought compensation for families of the victims of the Airbus
downing; for the Tehran government, and for the airline, Iran Air.
   It asked punitive damages for what it called ``the criminal
nature of the act.''
   Iran demanded a ``reparations declaration,'' but did not specify
in the memorial's introduction what that declaration would involve.
   Elements of the introduction were obtained by The Associated
Press.
   Iran filed the case in May 1989, and the Bush administration
said it would take part in the proceedings. Washington has until
March 4 to file its corresponding memorial.
   The court, the judicial arm of the U.N., has no enforcement
powers and depends on the voluntary adherence of states coming
before it.
   Iran's memorial was intended to prove that the court has
jurisdiction over the case and to state the facts of its claim.
   The memorial said America refused to accept responsibility for
the Airbus downing and continued to provoke Iran by its naval
presence in the gulf.
   It also wants the Council of the International Civil Aviation
Organization to reverse a November 1988 refusal to condemn
Washington for the incident.
   Iran said the United States violated Iranian sovereignty as well
as U.N. Charter provisions barring the use of force and assuring
freedom of navigation.
   Besides Iranians, the plane carried passengers from India,
Italy, Kuwait, Pakistan, Yugoslavia and United Arab Emirates.
   Then-President Reagan announced an offer of compensation to
victims' families eight days after the incident.
   The compensation process for non-Iranian victims began in 1989 _
$250,000 to the families of wage-earners, $100,000 to the families
of other victims.
   Iran insisted on being compensated directly for the downing, and
refused to provide a list of eligible next of kin.
   Iran's compensation demands include for life lost, mental
suffering, the loss of the plane itself, and the cost of search and
rescue operations.
   The World Court case is likely to be handled by the U.S. and
Iranian officials representing their governments at the Iran-United
States Claims Tribunal in The Hague.

   The National Planning Board on Tuesday reversed
its decision to delay construction of a Voice of America relay
station after U.S. officials pleaded for an immediate go-ahead
despite environmentalist protests.
   Israel's Nature Protection Society said it will appeal to the
Supreme Court.
   The board initially voted in June to halt the project in
Israel's Arava desert for a two-year ecological study of bird
migrations, which environmentalists said could be disturbed by the
transmitter.
   Environmentalists also spoke of possible radiation health
hazards.
   The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said in a statement it was
``pleased by today's vote ... and looks forward to rapid approval
by the government of Israel and early construction of the station.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide, Avi Pazner, also expressed
satisfaction.
   The U.S. government runs VOA. Tuesday's approval of the $300
million facility came a day after Washington repeated assurances
the transmitter would cause no harm.
   U.S. Ambassador William Brown wrote to Communications Minister
Rafael Pinhasi stressing the importance the United States attaches
to the project.
   The National Planning Board includes representatives of 11
ministries. It must approve all major national construction
projects. Final approval is up to the Cabinet.
   The station will transmit VOA broadcasts to Eastern Europe and
Africa. It was conceived as a Cold War tool, but U.S. officials
said it was also valuable in the era of detente.

<HEAD>Rival Shiite Forces Battle for Control of Strategic Lebanon Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDMOND SHEDID</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Militiamen loyal to Syria battled
house-to-house Tuesday in an effort to dislodge Iranian-backed
rival Shiite Moslems from a strategic hilltop town near Israel's
enclave in southern Lebanon.
   Police said 13 combatants were killed and 59 wounded in the
ninth day of fighting for control of the town of Jarjou and
surrounding villages near Israel's self-proclaimed ``security
zone.''
   The fighting raged into the evening as militiamen battled with
automatic weapons, shoulder-fired grenade launchers and hand
grenades, but there was no clear victor, police said.
   A police spokesman said about 1,500 fighters of the Amal militia
launched a pre-dawn attack on Jarjou behind a rain of mortar shells
and rockets. They were backed by about 500 pro-Syrian Lebanese
Baath Party militiamen.
   The attackers pushed through the defenses of the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, said the police spokesman, who cannot
be identified by name under briefing rules.
   In close-quarter combat, the attackers drove the Hezbollah
forces back toward the town's northern sector, the spokesman said.
   Flames, smoke and dust obscured the embattled town as thunderous
blasts of artillery shells reverberated across the rugged hills of
Iqlim al-Tuffah.
   Baathist and Amal communiques claimed their fighters overran
more than half of Jarjou. But Hezbollah contended the attack was
repulsed in a ``new bloodbath.''
   Both Amal and Hezbollah put out fresh claims that Israeli border
gunners had pounded their positions in and around Jarjou. The claim
could not be independently verified.
   Amal attempted to recapture Jarjou with the support of
Palestinian guerrillas on Friday. But the attack failed after two
days of close combat. The Palestinians apparently took no part in
Amal's new attack.
   Tuesday's casualties raised the overall toll to 139 dead and 427
wounded since July 16, when Hezbollah wrested Jarjou from Amal in a
surprise attack, touching off the latest round in a three-year,
on-and-off confrontation.
   At stake is control of the 1.2. million Shiites who make up the
largest single sect in Lebanon.
   The Baathist intervention on Amal's side suggests the Syrian
government of President Hafez Assad wants to curb Iran's growing
influence through Hezbollah. The Baath militiamen were sent to the
south last week, but had kept a low profile until Tuesday's
fighting.
   Syria, which was Persian Iran's main Arab ally in the eight-year
Persian Gulf war against Arab Iraq, views Lebanon as its own
backyard.
   The Syrians have 40,000 troops stationed in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League mandate to quell Lebanon's Moslem-Christian civil war,
now in its 16th year.
   But the Syrian army has refrained from entering southern Lebanon
to avoid a collision with Israel. Israel has said it will not
tolerate a Syrian military presence near its border with Lebanon.

<HEAD>Networks Enlist Allies In Fight For Syndication Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major television network claimed new allies
Tuesday in the networks' fight to change TV syndication rules while
a motion picture industry leader accused NBC, CBS and NBC of trying
to stifle competition.
   NBC told the Federal Communications Commission that the
million-member National Education Association and the advocacy
group, Action for Children's Television, no longer support the
existing syndication rules and that several other groups support
the network position.
   At issue is whether the three major networks should be given the
right to invest in shows they air and then reap the benefits of
both foreign and domestic syndication or redistribution as movies
or videotapes.
   An FCC rule in effect since 1970 bars the networks from having a
financial interest in shows they don't wholly own, and bars them
from syndicating even their own shows in the United States.
   Opponents say the Financial Interest and Syndication Rule
discourages the major networks from taking risks to develop
innovative programs. Proponents of the rule say it prevents the
networks from dominating prime-time television.
   The movie industry and the major networks failed to resolve the
issue after several years of negotiations, and the FCC has said it
will decide whether to rescind the rules after taking final
comments Aug. 1.
   NBC, in a statement filed with the commission, said groups with
a combined membership of about 20 million people support a repeal
of the rule. They include hundreds of local television stations,
labor unions, teachers' organizations, and senior citizen and other
consumer groups, the network said.
   ``Most do not have any economic stake in the outcome of this
rulemaking proceeding, but recognize the value of maintaining a
free and diverse television program service,'' NBC said in its
statement signed by general counsel Richard Cotton.
   In an interview, Cotton said the industry has changed
considerably since the 1970s when the three major networks
commanded 90 percent of the prime-time audience. A recent survey
showed audiences for NBC, ABC and CBS totalling 52 percent, he said.
   He said 60 percent of U.S. homes now have cable television, with
an average of 30 stations per household compared to seven in 1970s.
He said networks purchase only 21 percent of programs compared with
75 percent in 1970.
   The network was responding to an assertion by Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association of America, that only
the networks support repeal of the rule.
   Valenti said in a speech Tuesday the public would be ill-served
``when a few people accumulate life-and-death authority over what
Americans see on prime-time television.''
   He said the rules serves as a check on network abuse of power.
   The rule, Valenti said, ``has restored competition to a program
arena previously barren to competition, and it has allowed
independent television stations to grow and prosper.''

   Marlon Brando's son was ordered Tuesday to
stand trial for murder in the shooting of his sister's lover after
a prosecutor quoted Christian Brando as saying of the victim:
``Death is too good for the guy.''
   Municipal Judge Larry Fidler set bail at $10 million, saying
that was the only way to ensure he wouldn't flee.
   A spokeswoman for the District Attorney said the amount may be
the highest ever set by a Los Angeles County judge.
   Marlon Brando had offered to put up his house, worth more than
$5 million, to guarantee his son's return. The prosecution had
sought no bail.
   Defense attorney Robert Shapiro indicated the Brando family
would post bail, but declined to say when or how it would be posted.
   ``I've talked to Christian's father, brother and family. They're
anxiously awaiting his return home.''
   Marlon Brando was hurriedly led out of a back door of the
courtroom after making some notes on the judge's decision.
   The judge, who listened to two days of testimony about the
killing of Dag Drollet, said he had to decide whether Christian
Brando committed murder, rather than manslaughter, the charge the
defense had sought.
   ``It would appear to me from the evidence presented that the
district attorney has certainly met the burden of proof,'' Fidler
said. ``There has been a killing and the defendant pulled the
trigger.''
   A Superior Court arraignment was set for Aug. 7.
   Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop read the judge a
statement the younger Brando made to the first police officer who
arrived at his father's Mulholland Drive estate after the shooting
May 16.
   ``I shot him, man, but not on purpose,'' he quoted Brando as
saying. ``It was an accident. The gun was under the couch. I kept
it there.''
   Barshop quoted him as saying, ``I did it because he hurt my
sister. My sister is pregnant....He was fighting with my sister.''
   Later in the statement, Brando conceded that he disliked Drollet
and declared, ``Man, death is too good for the guy.''
   Christian Brando told police the gun went off during a fight,
but prosecutors contend there wasn't any evidence of a struggle.
   They said paramedics found Drollet on a couch, with a cigarette
lighter in one hand and a television remote control in the other.
   Moments before the hearing ended, Laurene Landon Coughlin, a
former girlfriend of Christian Brando, testified that the
32-year-old defendant came to her apartment shortly before the
shooting and appeared to be intoxicated.
   Defense attorney Shapiro told the court earlier that Marlon
Brando planned to make a shrine to Drollet in the room where he was
killed. That could explain why the elder Brando resisted police
efforts to return to the scene weeks later to reconstruct the
crime, Shapiro said.
   The white-haired, portly actor, who sat in a front row of the
courtroom for a second day, closed his eyes and extended his hands
at one point as if meditating.
   Across the courtroom, Drollet's mother wept as a firearms expert
described the face wound that killed her son.
   The expert, David Butler of the Los Angeles Police Department,
said that Drollet was shot under his left eye at such close range
that minute particles of tissue were left on the muzzle of the
.45-caliber semiautomatic pistol.
   Also at Tuesday's hearing, Fidler refused to admit into evidence
a statement from Christian Brando's sister, Cheyenne Brando, that
was taken before she left for Tahiti. She reportedly told police
she considered the killing of her boyfriend murder, not an accident.
   Barshop said he hopes to coax Miss Brando into returning from
Tahiti to testify at Christian's trial.

   Iraq accused neighboring Kuwait on Tuesday of
conspiring to harm its economy and massed tens of thousands of
troops and hundreds of tanks on the border.
   Informed sources in Kuwait said the Iraqi troop buildup had
increased over the last 48 hours to at least 30,000, and that more
than 200 Soviet-made tanks were posted along Iraq's 100-mile-long
southern border with Kuwait.
   The area of the troop buildup is rich in oil reserves, and has
been a source of contention since Kuwait gained its independence
from Britain in 1961. The border demarcation has never been agreed
on by Iraq, and a portion of it crosses the Rumaila oil field.
   The same sources said Kuwait on Tuesday reinstated its state of
alert, declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension
between the two oil-producing countries. Iraq has 17 million
residents, including 1 million troops. Kuwait was 1.8 million
residents, and 20,300 members of the armed forces.
   The U.S. Defense Department, meanwhile, announced that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft were holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
south of the Kuwait-Iraq dispute.
   The United States has at least seven warships in the Gulf at any
given moment. The State Department announced at the beginning of
the crisis that it backs Kuwait's territorial integrity.
   Iraq has accused Kuwait of being an American puppet and of
conspiring with the United States to throttle the economy of Iraq,
which has the world's second-largest oil reserves but endured a
costly war from 1980-88 with Iran.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said both Iraq and Kuwait had strengthened their armed
forces.
   ``Iraq and others know there is no place for coercion in a
civilized world,'' she said. ``All disputes should be handled
through peaceful means.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew to Baghdad and Kuwait on
Tuesday to meet with mediate the crises with leaders of those
countries. Mubarak said his mission was successful, but Iraq
downplayed his efforts.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein claims his country lost $14
billion during the past year because of a world oil glut that has
sent crude prices tumbling. He has accused Kuwait and the United
Arab Emirates of overproduction.
   In a long letter Tuesday to the Arab League, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tareq Aziz charged Kuwait with stealing Iraqi oil from the
Rumaila field, which he said was entirely owned by Iraq. The field
extends two miles into Kuwait.
   Many observers said they believe Saddam, who has spent an
estimated $50 billion on sophisticated arms since coming to power
in 1979, is engaging in saber-rattling to back his demands for
lower oil production and higher prices.
   Iraq has said it will push for a $7 increase in oil prices at
the Wednesday meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries in Geneva.
   The 13-member group is to set production and prices for the rest
of the year.
   Tuesday, Iraq's government newspaper Al-Joumhouriya accused
Kuwait of coordinating its moves with the United States in order to
``clear the way for foreign powers to intervene in the area.''
   It also accused Kuwait of ignoring Arab solidarity by demanding
the repayment of loans made to support Iraq during the Iran-Iraq
war.
   Kuwait loaned Iraq an estimated $15 billion during the war. Iraq
owes foreign creditors about $70 billion.
   Reports of the troop buildup sent jitters through world
financial markets.
   In Tokyo, the dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen over
news of increasing unrest in the Gulf.
   Missiles, armored personel carriers and tanks were prominently
displayed along the road from Iraq to Kuwait as travelers poured
back to the Gulf state when the dispute erupted. Iraq was a popular
vacation destination for Kuwaitis.
   Diplomats said the buildup has escalated since Monday, when the
Washington Post quoted sources in Washington as saying two
divisions of the elite Republican Guards Corps were moved to the
border.
   The diplomats and informed sources in the Gulf on Tuesday put
the number of Iraq troops at 30,000 on the southern border, nearly
50 percent more than the number of armed forces in Kuwait.
   In Washington, Pete Williams, a Defense Department spokesman,
told reporters that the joint U.S.-Emirates exercise codenamed
``Ivory Justice'' began Monday and that two U.S. Navy vessels left
from their port at Bahrain to participate.
   He declined to comment on the purpose of the maneuvers.
   The official Kuwait News Agency quoted Mubarak as describing his
talks with Iraqi and Kuwaiti leaders as ``successful.''
   But Aziz told the official Iraqi News Agency: ``With due respect
to our Arab brothers, it has never happened in the past that such
disputes were solved by Arab mediation committees.''
   Shortly after Kuwait gained its independendence, Iraq claimed
sovereignty and the Kuwaitis called on Britain for assistance.
Britain sent in paratroopers and they were replaced by an Arab
force led by Egypt, which acted as a buffer between the two
countries until tensions eased in 1963.
   Kuwait suffered itself during the Gulf war when Iran attacked
Kuwaiti shipping lanes, fired missiles on the coast, and was held
responsible for acts of terrorism that included an attempt on the
life of the Emir of Kuwait in 1985.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil-eating bacteria are breaking down
the mess left by the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound and
should be used on other spills, the nation's top environmental
official said.
   William K. Reilly, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency,
said Monday that such ``bioremediation'' efforts should continue on
shores fouled by the Exxon Valdez spill, even if that means a third
summer of cleanup.
   State and Coast Guard officials disagree over how long manual
and mechanical methods like flushing and tilling should accompany
bioremediation. In the bioremediation method used here, chemical
fertilizers that promote the growth of oil-eating bacteria were
spread on sullied beaches.
   ``There's no question that we have made progress toward cleanup
that is notable, significant and very encouraging,'' Reilly told
reporters after his shoreline tour with Alaska environmental
commissioner Dennis Kelso.
   It was Reilly's first visit to Prince William Sound since late
last summer, and his third since the tanker Exxon Valdez ran
aground in March 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of crude
oil in the nation's biggest oil spill.
   The success of bioremediation here bodes well for other oil
spills, and for sites nationwide that have been polluted by leaking
underground storage tanks, Reilly said.
   ``I would very much hope that bioremediation comes on in a big
way throughout the United States,'' Reilly said. ``We are
developing an intimate familiarity with oil spills and we
desperately need new technologies.''
   Some environmentalists opposed spreading the phosphorous- and
nitrogen-based fertilizers on the shoreline, fearing they might
wreak havoc on an environment already battered by the massive spill.
   However, no major adverse effects have been reported since the
fertilizers were spread earlier this summer, officials said.
   In June, natural oil-eating microbes were used to clean up a
light crude oil spill off Galveston, Texas. The successful effort
marked the first time bioremediation was used in open waters.
   Meanwhile, state and Coast Guard officials are arguing about how
long the cleanup should continue in Alaska and who is authorized to
end it.
   Kelso has said work should continue anywhere there are more than
5 grams of oil per kilogram of beach material. That's than
one-tenth of an ounce of oil per pound of rocks or sand. The shores
should be clean enough not only for wildlife habitation but also
for recreational use, he said.
   But Coast Guard Rear Admiral David Ciancaglini, the federal
on-scene coordinator, said the cleanup should stop before it
intrudes on the natural, recovering habitat.
   Reilly said another summer cleanup would be warranted if a
subsurface problem of any size remains next spring.
   Officials from Exxon Corp., which is funding the cleanup, have
said they believe the effort can be completed this summer.

<TEXT>
   When David Souter was attorney general, New
Hampshire lost in the U.S. Supreme Court one of its most widely
followed court cases, brought against a couple for covering the
``Live Free or Die'' motto on their license plates.
   George and Maxine Maynard taped over the motto in 1975, citing
religious objections. They were Jehovah's Witnesses and said they
didn't believe that freedom is more important than life.
   Their plates were taken away, and after refusing to pay a fine,
George Maynard spent 15 days in jail.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., was attorney general at the time.
   A three-judge federal panel upheld the Maynards' right to
obliterate the motto, but flamboyant Gov. Meldrim Thomson vowed to
fight them all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and ordered
Souter, who succeeded Rudman, to proceed with the appeal.
   Souter said he did not see the state's action as infringing on
the Maynards' right to free speech.
   ``This was not an articulated statement of words _ it was an
act,'' he said.
   The high court didn't see it that way, and ruled in 1977 that
states may not force their residents to display mottoes or other
ideological messages on license plates or other personal property.
   ``The First Amendment protects the right of individuals to hold
points of view different from the majority and to refuse to foster,
in the way New Hampshire commands, an idea they find morally
objectionable,'' the court wrote.
   Souter said he was not surprised.
   ``We realized this was a difficult case since the law clearly
didn't favor us,'' he said.
   Eight months after the high court ruled, the Maynards still were
trying to collect $21,000 in legal fees from the state. So, a U.S.
marshal, armed with a warrant, went to a busy state-owned liquor
store and ordered the manager to hand over the money. The manager
called the governor, who promised payment and the money came
through two weeks later.

<TEXT>
   Salvadoran government and guerrilla
negotiators skipped ahead to a discussion of human rights on
Tuesday in an effort to salvage some accord from a crucial round of
peace talks in San Jose.
   The talks had bogged down on the subject of overhaul of the
armed forces.
   The Costa Rican session began last Friday. It is seen as vital
to maintaining momentum toward a negotiated end to El Salvador's
10-year-old civil war, which has killed an estimated 72,000 people.
   The Salvadoran military meanwhile announced that a judiciary
official was assassinated by rebels and five guerrillas were killed
and four soldiers wounded in renewed fighting Tuesday in El
Salvador.
   Senior guerrilla commander Schafik Handal told journalists in
this Costa Rican capital that rebel delegates agreed to move on to
discuss human rights, second item on the agenda, ``in an effort to
save the negotiations.''
   ``There is still time to reach accords,'' he said.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, has said
lack of progress at this round would make a major insurgent
offensive likely. High authorities of the government of President
Alfredo Cristiani have said a big rebel push could scrap the talks.
   Justice Minister Oscar Santamaria, the chief government
delegate, termed ``surrealist'' on Tuesday rebel demands for
demilitarization of El Salvador.
   Handal characterized the government response to rebel proposals
for military overhaul as ``irresponsible, not serious.'' He said
the government position amounted to ``provocation.''
   The session here, due to end Wednesday, follows negotiations in
Venezuela in May and Mexico in June. The first round of
U.N.-mediated talks produced an agenda, with the future role of the
armed forces as lead item.
   Five days of talks in Mexico on the military and four days here
produced no accord. The rebels said the government position
presented since Friday in some aspects represented ``a step
backward'' from Mexico.
   The FMLN demands: a purge of the officer corps to rid it of
those it sees as flagrant abusers of human rights; an end to
military impunity; creation of a civilian-controlled police force
to replace the current militarized police; eradication of
military-linked death squads; dissolution of paramilitary forces,
and an end to forced conscription.
   The government proposed strengthening of existing mechanisms
designed to permit the military to police itself and creation of
new ones. It said it would dissolve paramilitary Civil Defense
forces once the FMLN was demobilized.
   Handal said the armed forces issue ``is still the crucial
subject, and remains to be resolved.''
   Some type of accord on human rights appeared possible.
   International human rights groups have blamed the Salvadoran
armed forces and military-linked death squads in the deaths of
about 30,000 suspected leftists in the past decade. No officer has
been convicted, or even tried in connection with a rights abuse
crime.
   Guerrilla sources said the rebels will propose establishing a
human rights office under a special prosecutor. The office would be
subject to international supervision. Negotiators would work out
the particulars.
   Santamaria told journalists Tuesday the government ``is willing
to accept international vigilance over the human rights process.''
   An armed forces news release in San Salvador said troops killed
five guerrillas in a fire fight near Zafra, 112 miles east of the
capital, and four soldiers were wounded in a clash near Cinquera,
42 miles east of San Salvador.
   Guerrillas on Monday night killed Jose Heriberto Rubio, a
justice of the peace in Nueva Esparta, 124 miles east of San
Salvador, the news release said. It identified Rubio only as the
father of an army lieutenant.
   Guerrillas destroyed two city buses in San Salvador's
working-class district of Soyapango, the release said.

   The federal racketeering and gambling trial
of New Orleans' district attorney, a former federal attorney, a
television actor and others went to a jury Tuesday.
   Jurors will begin deliberations Wednesday.
   At the heart of the six-week trial was the allegation that
District Attorney Harry Connick illegally returned seized gambling
records to known bookmaker Walton Aucoin so Aucoin could pay off
and collect gambling debts.
   On trial with Connick are actor Paul Burke and former assistant
U.S. Attorney Patrick Fanning. Aucoin also is a co-defendant, along
with two of his alleged employees _ Steve Bertolino and William G.
Condon of Metairie _ and New Orleans businessman Wilson Abraham.
   Connick, 63, is the father of Grammy-winning jazz musician Harry
Connick Jr. He has been district attorney in New Orleans since 1973.
   Burke once starred in television's ``The Naked City'' and played
a congressman on ``Dynasty,'' and had guest roles on numerous other
series.
   Prosecutors, led by James Cole of the Justice Department in
Washington, made much of the fact that Connick ordered the return
of Aucoin's records just five days after Aucoin was arrested on
Dec. 4, 1988. The records were returned before Connick's office
accepted the case for prosecution, prosecutors said.
   Defense lawyers, who delivered their final arguments earlier
Tuesday, have maintained Connick simply gave Aucoin something he
was entitled to as a suspect in a crime and as a man who planned to
pay federal taxes on his gambling income.
   ``The crime in this case exists solely in the minds of the
prosecutors,'' defense attorney William Wessell said in his closing
argument.
   The trial began June 11. The indictment was returned last
December after a year-long investigation begun by U.S. Attorney
John Volz.
   Connick and Volz had been at odds for years over various issues
and Volz later turned the case over to the Justice Department
saying he wanted to avoid any appearance of bias or conflict.
   Nevertheless, Connick blamed Volz when the indictment was handed
down and accused him of carrying out a political vendetta.
   Aucoin, Bertolino and Condon were accused of running an illegal
gambling operation. Fanning, Burke and Abraham were accused of
helping cook up phony reasons for Connick to return records to the
bookie, that is, that Aucoin had to have them to pay taxes on his
bookmaking income.
   Fanning, once an assistant to Volz, was Aucoin's lawyer at the
time. Burke was an acquaintance of Connick and Aucoin, as was
Abraham, a contributor to Connick's political campaigns.
   The specific charges against the defendants were listed in the
indictment as ``conducting the affairs of an enterprise through the
collection of unlawful debt and conducting an illegal gambling
business.'' Burke also was charged with lying to the grand jury.
   Connick faced a possible maximum sentence of 25 years in prison
and a $500,000 fine. Burke, with the added perjury charge, faced up
to 30 years and $750,000 in fines.
   The investigation also involved former Louisiana Gov. Edwin
Edwards and a suburban sheriff, Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish,
although neither man was indicted. Lee testified that he once
returned gambling records to Aucoin after an arrest and Edwards was
widely reported to have called Lee on Aucoin's behalf to urge
return of those records.

<HEAD>Study Questions Hospital Mortality Report</HEAD>

   A study casts new doubt on federal reports that
list hospital death rates and fuels concern that the reports are a
poor measure of hospital quality, a researcher said Tuesday.
   Researchers for the Rand Corp. found that varying death rates
among two types of heart patients could be attributed to random
statistical variations, rather than the treatment the patients
received.
   Their report is published in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association. It follows by six months a study published in
the same journal that criticized the government for inadequately
examining how the severity of illness may affect hospital death
rates.
   The new study didn't test the most recent method used by the
Health Care Financing Administration to compare mortality rates
among Medicare patients at the nation's nearly 6,000 hospitals.
   But the Rand study still urges caution in analyzing the yearly
reports by the health care administration, which adminsters the
Medicare program, said Rolla Edward Park, principal author.
   ``I think what it points toward is the need to continue to try
to improve the HCFA methods to figure out what kind of information
can be put into consumers' hands that is the most useful,'' Park
said.
   Officials at the HCFA, which funded part of the Rand study, said
they would consider the study in a continuing effort to improve
their reporting. But they said the Rand approach to death rates is
not comparable to theirs.
   Reports titled ``Medicare Hospital Mortality Information'' have
been issued publicly for the past three years by the HCFA, an arm
of the Department of Health and Human Services. The reports use
statistical techniques to compare predicted hospital mortality
rates with the actual number of deaths.
   Federal officials each year have warned against using the
reports as the sole measure of a hospital's quality.
   Rand's four-state study looked at a sample of 2,276 deaths among
Medicare patients at 734 hospitals. Congestive heart failure, in
which the heart's gradual loss of strength causes the lungs to fill
with fluid, accounted for 1,126 deaths, and heart attacks accounted
for 1,150.
   When analyzing the quality of care, researchers found some
hospitals with higher-than-expected death rates _ called
``targeted'' hospitals _ actually provided better care than
non-targeted hospitals.
   Researchers found that targeted hospitals treated more serious
heart attack cases, and therefore could reasonably expect higher
death rates.
   No statistical difference was found in the severity of illness
among patients with congestive heart failure, the researchers said.
   The researchers used a computer model to measure how much of the
difference in death rates could be attributed to random variations.
The figures from the simulation roughly matched the actual
difference in death rates between the targeted and nontargeted
hospitals, the researchers said.
   The Rand Corp. is a private, non-profit organization researches
and analyzes U.S. security and domestic policy.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo signed legislation Tuesday
banning dwarf tossing and dwarf bowling in New York bars, calling
the activities a ``strange diversion.''
   ``Any activity which dehumanizes and humiliates these people is
degrading to us all,'' Cuomo said. ``This bill recognizes that and,
in effect, declares these bizarre games to be debased.''
   The bill, similar to one that became law in Florida last year,
amounts to a ban because the events have not been popular outside
bars. It passed the legislature with only one dissenting vote.
   The law targets taverns, but has no penalties for participants.
Bars could loose their liquor licenses.
   Dwarf tossing is a competition in which people pick up dwarfs,
who are wearing harnesses, and heave them as far as possible at a
padded target. It produced an offshoot, dwarf bowling, in which a
helmeted dwarf is strapped to a skateboard and rolled into bowling
pins. Both have been held as competitions for cash prizes, Cuomo
said.
   A New York City area promoter said the law amounts to censorship.
   Baird Jones said his dwarf events are performance art designed
to satirize the values of mainstream America.
   ``Because we're doing this where alcohol is being served, we're
being lumped with bar sports,'' Jones said. ``This is not someone
promoting wrestling in Jell-O between naked women.''
   The games originated in Australia and made their way to the
United States about five years ago.
   ``Dwarf tossing belongs in the Middle Ages, not the modern
age,'' said state Sen. Nicholas Spano, who sponsored the bill.
   The legislation had been pushed by the Little People of America,
an organization founded in 1957 by actor Billy Barty.
   In his approval message Tuesday, Cuomo said he was swayed by
arguments from dwarf advocates that the games ``only perpetuate the
outdated images of dwarfs as court jesters or circus freaks'' and
posed medical dangers. Supporters of the bill had maintained that
dwarfs have brittle bones.
   Cuomo said he was also sensitive to arguments, voiced recently
by syndicated columnist Mike Royko, that ``government has no
business meddling in the rights of a consenting adult dwarf to be
tossed or bowled.''
   ``This state does not lightly impose limits on the activities of
consenting participants,'' Cuomo said. ``But balancing all the
interests affected, I am persuaded that approval of this bill
respects human dignity and protects the safety and self respect of
the special people who are the subject of this strange diversion.''
   The legislation may be largely symbolic. Officials at Little
People of America say dwarf tossing has virtually stopped, killed
at least in part by negative publicity.
   Heidi Heinrich, of Tallahassee, Fla., who has been a national
leader in the fight against dwarf tossing, has said she was aware
of only one exhibition of the game in recent months. That was in
South Carolina and took place while that state's Legislature was
considering a bill to outlaw the practice. The bill was defeated.

<TEXT>
   A proposed $180 million budget for the
embattled National Endowment for the Arts, including a $900,000
increase in federal funds for state arts agencies, was approved
Tuesday by a House Appropriations subcommittee.
   The bill was sent to the full House Appropriations Committee by
voice vote without action on any anti-obscenity amendments that
would restrict the kinds of art eligible for tax-paid endowment
grants.
   A major House floor fight had been expected to begin Friday on
separate legislation that would extend the NEA's life for another
five years, but late in the day Tuesday Jeff Biggs, press aide to
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said that debate had been
postponed until after the August recess because more than 20
amendments needed to be considered.
   Republicans are drafting proposals for a drastic overhaul of the
endowment as a result of past financial support for art that
conservatives have denounced as obscene or sacrilegious.
   The appropriations bill approved by the subcommittee Tuesday
would provide a 5 percent increase in the NEA budget, from $171.3
million to $180 million in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   At the urging of Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., the subcommittee
chairman and a staunch arts advocate, the panel approved boosting
endowment funds for states arts councils from $26.1 million to $27
million.
   Increases for dance, music, opera and musical theater, the media
arts and design arts also were approved.
   A major proposal of the House Republican plan to restructure the
arts endowment would funnel 60 percent of NEA grant money to the
states, compared with the current level of 20 percent.
   The GOP measure, drafted chiefly by Reps. Tom Coleman of
Missouri and Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, also would require the
NEA chairman to assure Congress that federally supported art is
``sensitive to the nature of public sponsorship and to the cultural
heritage of the United States, its religious traditions or racial
or ethnic groups, and does not violate prevailing standards of
obscenity.''
   The obscenity provision is the most controversial feature of the
Coleman-Gunderson plan, which will be submitted when the House
begins debate on the NEA's re-authorization bill later this week.
   The endowment is an independent federal agency that underwrites
a wide variety of artists and arts institutions with tax-paid
grants requiring matching funds from private sources.
   For more than a year, the NEA has been the focus of a growing
political controversy over its previous support for exhibitions of
sexually explicit works by the late photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano.
   Under pressure from Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other
conservative legislators and from religious fundamentalists,
Congress voted last fall to prohibit the NEA from supporting
artwork that ``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions of
sex acts, sadomasochism, homoeroticism or sexual exploitation of
children.''
   The Coleman-Gunderson anti-obscenity provision is based on the
Supreme Court's 1973 definition of obscenity, which covers works
that appeal to prurient interest, portray patently offensive sexual
conduct and lack serious artistic, scientific, political or
literary value based on community standards.
   The Republican bill would allow the endowment to recover grant
funds if the NEA chairman concluded that a recipient's work
violated the Supreme Court standards on obscenity. The recipient
could appeal in federal court.

   A man went on trial Tuesday for allegedly inciting
anti-Semitism in a violent protest that galvanized fears of pogroms
among Soviet Jews and prompted some to flee.
   Konstantin Smirnov-Ostashvili denied being anti-Semitic, but in
a conversation with reporters from the dock charged that Jews
wielded a disproportionate share of power.
   ``A Russian person is brought to trial in the center of Russia
... for insulting, injuring the dignity, and for instigating
intolerance against those who enjoy massive privileges, and who
hold the leading posts in our society,'' he said.
   He said he faced charges that could bring him up to five years
in prison because of a campaign by the Soviet press ``that belongs
... to the left, the democrats, the Zionists. I think it's all the
same.''
   Smirnov-Ostashvili was apparently the first person charged under
a strengthened law prohibiting ethnic insults, or appeals for
ethnic intolerance.
   He was arrested for allegedly being one of the organizers of a
Jan. 18 protest. The protesters broke up a meeting of writers at
Moscow's Central House of Literature and roughed up some of the
participants.
   Judge A.I. Muratov postponed the trial in the Moscow City Court
for a day before Smirnov-Ostashvili could enter a plea because of a
crush of reporters surrounding the dock and a raucous crowd of
several hundred people. Some of those present applauded the
defendant's statements and shouted ``Shame!'' when Muratov denied
his motion to dismiss his attorney.
   More than 71,000 Jews emigrated from the Soviet Union as travel
laws were eased last year, and thousands more have left this year.
   Jewish leaders have cited ``an unprecedented panic among the
Jewish population'' in the face of threats from extreme Russian
nationalist groups such as the Pamyat society. Such groups accuse
the country's 1.4 million Jews of dragging Russia down into a
morass of Soviet socialism.
   One Jew who attended the trial said it would test the Soviet
court system, which historically has been viewed as little more
than an arm of the Communist authorities.
   ``I am going to find out how just Soviet justice is, how much we
are going to be protected,'' said the 36-year-old psychiatrist who
identified himself only as Eduard.
   He said he also would learn how strong Smirnov-Ostashvili's
supporters are.
   The case has received wide publicity in the Soviet press, and
served to highten Jews' fears of anti-Semitic attacks.
   The popular weekly Ogonyok quoted demonstrators as saying
through a megaphone at the Jan. 18 meeting:
   ``Your time is over. Neither the police, nor the KGB, nor the
party will help you. Now we will be the masters of the country, and
you, newcomers, clear out and go to Israel. How long can we
tolerate your Russophobia?''
   In a rare preview, the government newspaper Izvestia published a
short report announcing the trial last week. On Sunday, the
Communist Party daily Pravda printed an editorial urging the
country to come to grips with its history of anti-Semitism.
   S. Rogov, a historian, wrote in Pravda that it would be ``at
minimum stupid'' to pretend there is no problem. Many Jews do not
want to emigrate, he said, but ``their fear of the specter of
pogroms is beginning to grow into a panic.''
   In another development, a Jewish parliamentarian demanded Monday
that Russian writer Valentin Rasputin resign from Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's Presidential Council for alleged anti-Semitic
statements.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili, 64, was brought to trial after a five-month
investigation in which more than 400 people were questioned.
   He said that if Muratov and two civilian assistants tried him on
a strictly legal basis, he likely would be given a heavy sentence.
But if they consider the polarization in the country, they should
not punish him severely because that would worsen the political
tension, he said.
   Smirnov-Ostashvili said he could not be considered anti-Semitic.
   ``Nowhere in any of my declarations was there an insult to Jews
as a nation,'' he said. ``I have spoken all the time about
Zionists.''
   He also showed reporters an award from the Soviet government for
giving blood, and said that also proved he was not a racist.
   ``How can you be an honored donor of the Soviet Union, having
given 30 liters of blood to our medicine, not knowing where it is
going _ to Georgian children, to Jewish children, to Russian
children _ how can an honored donor be an anti-Semite?'' he asked.

   Sixteen people were charged Tuesday with
participating in a scheme to rob homes and businesses of jewelry,
rare coins and precious gems and then resell the merchandise in
Manhattan's Diamond District.
   Two men who owned several businesses in the district were
identified as the leaders of the fencing ring, which authorities
said was in operation since 1982.
   James M. Fox, assistant director of the FBI's New York office,
said the participants would use every opportunity to commit a
robbery.
   ``Some were blatant armed robberies in broad daylight on the
streets of Manhattan. Other times, they cased out residences or
businesses ... and would go in covertly,'' Fox said at a news
conference with U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier.
   Fox said it was not uncommon for jewelry to be reset and
displayed in one of the ringleaders' stores as quickly as two hours
after it was stolen.
   Although court papers said the defendants netted $1.2 million,
Fox said the amount could be much higher because the scheme had
been going on for so long.
   Court papers listed a series of robberies of homes and
businesses in New Jersey from 1983 to 1985; the theft of $221,000
worth of jewelry from a Greek exporting company in 1987 and 10
Rolex watches from a foreign shipment in 1986; and the armed
robbery of a North Palm Beach, Fla., home in 1983 that netted
$60,000 worth of jewelry and merchandise.
   Fox and Obermaier released three separate indictments arising
from the fencing scheme. One charged the two store owners, Felix
Friedman and Lawrence Tinnirello, and seven others with
racketeering and various fraud counts.
   Friedman and Tinnirello operated as many as 13 stores, some of
which are still in business, in the Diamond District, located on
47th Street between Fifth and Sixth avenues, authorities said.
   The racketeering indictment also outlined a scheme in which the
defendants allegedly obtained jewelry from other merchants on
consignment and then kept the items without paying the owner.
   Friedman, who was described by a prosecutor as ``the business
brains behind the fence people,'' was ordered held without bail by
U.S. Magistrate Naomi Buchwald. She found he was likely to threaten
witnesses if released.
   Tinnirello was held overnight pending a further bail hearing
Wednesday. Assistant U.S. Attorney James Comey said both had been
involved in acts of violence.
   Four other men were charged with robbery conspiracy in
connection with the robbery of a Brooklyn jewelry store last year,
and a fifth was accused of fraud in the consignment scheme.
   A third indictment charged the wives of the store owners, Irina
Zaritskaya and Mindy Tinnirello, with making false statements to
banks in order to hide the profits of the fencing scheme. They each
face up to five years in prison on one count of making false
statements to banks. They were released on their own recognizance.

   Keystone Camera Products Corp., claiming to be
the last American maker of conventional fixed-focus cameras, lost
its bid Tuesday for trade relief from imports.
   The four U.S. International Trade Commission members voted
unanimously against granting the import quotas and higher tariffs
the Clifton, N.J. firm sought.
   ``Imports of cameras were not a substantial cause of injury to
the domestic camera industry,'' the commission members found.
   Keystone, which made 2.5 million cameras last year, claims it is
the sole remaining American manufacturer of conventional 35mm fixed
focus and point-and-shoot cameras and pocket cameras in the popular
110 film size.
   Its petition excluded imported disc, single-lens reflex, instant
print and 110 cameras with variable focus.
   Keystone contended that imports from Japan, China, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Mexico, South Korea, Thailand and Brazil have hurt the
domestic camera industry and could jeopardize the future of 500
manufacturing and distribution jobs.
   The company said that imports of the types of cameras it
produces increased from 11 million in 1985 to 27.5 million in 1987.
   Earlier, Chairman Myron J. Berman had said that without import
restrictions, Keystone would be forced to move production overseas,
as other camera makers have done. He said Keystone already had cut
costs to the bone.
   Keystone could pursue alternate appeals for help, such as
charging that foreign cameras have been dumped in the American
marketplace at less than fair-market value, said Betsy Godley, a
spokesman for the trade panel.
   Photography giant Eastman Kodak Co. of Rochester, N.Y., which
said it was not being hurt by imports, had asked the trade
commission to deny relief to Keystone.
   Kodak, which operates around the world, argued that Keystone was
responsible for its own market troubles because of poor management
decisions.
   Kodak also had disputed Keystone's claim to be the last bona
fide American camera maker.

   A federal judge refused to dismiss charges
Tuesday against three former Northwest Airlines pilots accused of
flying drunk.
   Judge James Rosenbaum, following recommendations made by U.S.
Magistrate J. Earl Cudd on July 6, also denied defense motions to
suppress physical evidence and statements, and to grant the
defendants separate trials.
   Jury selection was to begin Wednesday morning in the U.S.
District Court trial of the former pilots, accused of being drunk
while flying a commercial airliner from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis
March 8.
   The Boeing 727, with 91 passengers aboard, landed safely at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   Cudd had ruled that blood-alcohol tests could be used as
evidence against Capt. Norman Prouse, of Conyers, Ga.; 1st Officer
Robert Kirchner, of Highland Ranch, Colo.; and flight engineer
Joseph Balzer, of Antioch, Tenn.
   Prosecutors claim Prouse drank 19 rum and Diet Cokes the night
before the flight and that Kirchner and Balzer shared seven
pitchers of beer.
   A bar patron tipped the Federal Aviation Administration and
Northwest, prompting an FAA inspector to visit the cockpit before
the plane left Fargo, officials have said. FAA officials have said
the pilots were warned not to fly.
   Defense attorneys have said the inspector could have stopped the
flight, but did not intervene.
   The three pilots were arrested by an FAA official when the plane
landed.
   Northwest fired the trio for violating a company prohibition
against drinking alcohol within 12 hours of a scheduled flight. The
FAA revoked their licenses after its own investigation showed the
three had boarded the flight within eight hours of drinking.
   Separate tests by the FAA and Northwest showed each of the
pilots had a blood-alcohol level exceeding 0.04 percent, a
violation of federal regulations for flying.
   Conviction on the federal charge carries a maximum sentence of
15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   In North Dakota, each faces a state misdemeanor charge that
carries a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
   That trial is to begin Aug. 27.

<HEAD>Exxon Valdez Skipper Faces New Fight to Keep License</HEAD>

   Joseph Hazelwood, who was acquitted
four months ago of most criminal charges in the nation's worst oil
spill, faces a Coast Guard hearing that could strip him of his
license as a ship's master.
   In a hearing scheduled to start Wednesday, an administrative law
judge will decide whether the former Exxon Valdez skipper was
guilty of negligence and should forfeit his license.
   The judge, Harry J. Gardner, has a number of options in deciding
the case, according to the Coast Guard and Hazelwood's lawyers. He
could choose to dismiss all charges, revoke Hazelwood's license or
place him on probation.
   He cannot impose a fine or prison term.
   Hazelwood is accused of breaking a Coast Guard rule by drinking
within four hours of assuming command of his ship and leaving the
ship's bridge while the tanker was traveling through icy waters. He
also is accused of leaving a crewman who lacked a required license
in control of the bridge.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, said the defense would
argue that Hazelwood wasn't responsible for the ship's running into
a reef.
   The Exxon Valdez was en route from the Alaskan port of Valdez to
Long Beach on March 24, 1989, when it struck a charted reef. Gashed
by jagged rocks, the 987-foot tanker spilled 11 million gallons of
Alaska crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   ``Capt. Hazelwood looks forward to putting on his case and being
vindicated much as he has been in Alaska,'' Chalos said. ``He's
been spending most of his time helping us prepare for this
hearing.''
   The defense will argue that any drinking within four hours of
sailing was unintentional because the ship left port an hour
earlier than it was supposed to.
   The defense also plans to argue that the Coast Guard itself had
waived its requirement that the person in control of the bridge
have a pilot's license for Prince William Sound and that the Coast
Guard failed to adequately monitor the Exxon Valdez via radar.
   Hazelwood was acquitted at his two-month trial of being drunk
and reckless, but was convicted of one misdemeanor charge of
negligent discharge of oil. He was ordered to pay $50,000
restitution and spend 1,000 hours cleaning beaches at Prince
William Sound. He is appealing the verdict.
   An administrative hearing resembles a trial but is held without
a jury before an administrative law judge. The hearing could last
anywhere from a day to weeks.
   The hearing is being held in Long Beach because it is the
headquarters for the 11th Coast Guard District, which includes
Alaska.

   Jurors in the conspiracy and kidnapping
trial of a cult leader's wife will visit the farm where a family of
five was killed and buried, the judge said Tuesday.
   The announcement followed completion of jury selection in the
trial of Alice Lundgren, 39.
   She is charged with five counts each of conspiracy and
complicity to commit aggravated murder and five counts of
kidnapping. She is the first of 13 defendants to be tried in Lake
County Common Pleas Court.
   She faces a possible life prison term if convicted in the April
17, 1989, shooting deaths of religious cult members Dennis Avery,
49; his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their daughters, Trina, 15; Rebecca,
13; and Karen, 7.
   Their bodies were found in January buried under a barn in
Kirtland, where members the cult lived. Kirtland is about 30 miles
east of Cleveland.
   Mrs. Lundgren's husband, Jeffrey, a defrocked lay minister of
the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is
charged with five counts each of kidnapping and aggravated murder
in the case.
   Authorities have said the Averys may have been killed to cleanse
the spirits of other cult members or because Lundgren questioned
their devotion to the cult.
   Judge Paul H. Mitrovich told the jurors they would travel by bus
Wednesday morning to the farm, then return to the courthouse for
opening statements.
   Prosecutor Sandra A. Dray told prospective jurors she would call
as witnesses four cult members who have pleaded guilty in the case.
   Richard Brand pleaded guilty to five counts of murder. Gregory
Winship pleaded guilty to five counts of complicity to commit
murder. Deborah Olivarez and Sharon Bluntschly pleaded guilty to
five counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.
   All lived at the Kirtland farm. Brand, Olivarez and Bluntschly
were originally from Independence, Mo.; Winship was from Euclid.
   Jeffrey Lundgren could get the death penalty if convicted. His
trial is to begin Aug. 13.
   Mitrovich said Mrs. Lundgren's trial would last at least a week.

   A passenger bus rolled down a
mountainside after being hit by a truck Tuesday in eastern Mexico,
killing 19 people and injuring 15, a Red Cross official said.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Isabel Cervantes said in a telephone
interview that the crash occurred about 7:20 a.m. on a curve on a
mountain road near Ciudad Mendoza, a town in Veracruz state.
   ``The truck was going up the mountain road and sideswiped the
bus which was going down, then crashed into it again. The bus kept
going at great speed toward the next curve, then rolled off the
road and down the mountain,'' she said.
   Ms. Cervantes said the bus fell 33-48 feet down the mountain
before coming to a stop.
   She said the bus was on its way from Puebla to the port of
Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico. The truck was carrying a load of
empty bottles.
   A police report said there was no immediate indication what
caused the accident, but investigators at the scene suspect the
drivers of both vehicles were traveling much faster than road
conditions allowed.

<TEXT>
   President Bush launched the public campaign for
his Supreme Court nomination of Judge David H. Souter Tuesday as he
urged the Senate to avoid any ideological litmus test in the
confirmation process.
   In speeches to Republican fund-raising events in Philadelphia
and New York, Bush lavished praise on the man he picked Monday to
serve on the Supreme Court.
   ``I look forward to the Senate hearings of David Souter; I am
sure they will find him to be tough but fair,'' the president said
in a speech on behalf of New York GOP candidates at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
   ``He's a first-rate appellate judge, an outstanding jurist and a
great legal mind.''
   Before his speech in New York, Bush met for 25 minutes with
former President Ford, Deputy White House Press Secretary Stephen
Hart said. Hart said the president invited Ford to his room after
learning that the former president was at the hotel. He did not say
what they talked about.
   ``The Supreme Court must be guided by independent minds and its
members are appointed for life largely to keep them above the
flames of political passion,'' Bush said in Philadelphia.
   ``So in my nomination of Judge David Souter for Senate
confirmation ... there was no single issue, no litmus test or
standard dominating my decision.''
   ``And I will add there should be no litmus test in the process
of confirmation,'' Bush said.
   His statements drew applause from a crowd of about 500 at a
fund-raising luncheon for Pennsylvania Republicans.
   Later, Bush visited a neighborhood drug prevention center, and
declared, ``No crack in Philadelphia except for the one in the
Liberty Bell.''
   He pushed for swift action on an administration-backed crime
bill that he said would provide ``strong new tools to fight this
war on drugs.''
   Bush said on Monday he would nominate Souter, a former New
Hampshire Supreme Court justice recently named to the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, to succeed retiring Justice William J.
Brennan.
   Souter is widely expected to be questioned, in confirmation
hearings before the Democratic-dominated Senate Judiciary
Committee, about his views on the issue of abortion.
   Both abortion rights supporters and opponents were among a
variety of demonstrators carrying placards and chanting outside the
hotel where Bush spoke.
   Some members of the radical ACT UP _ AIDS Coalition to Unleash
Power _ hurled fake dollar bills from a window, and nine others
managed to evade security and stage a sit-down in the hall outside
the ballroom where the dinner was held. Still others staged ``die
ins'' in the lobby, dousing themselves with fake blood.
   Police said they arrested 37 people.
   ``My sole priority was to appoint a justice true to the life and
spirit of the Constitution,'' the president said, ``a priority that
I am confident will also guide the Congress in the confirmation
process.''
   ``I believe I am recommending an individual with a strong,
incisive independent devotion to interpreting the Constitution, a
quiet man of enormous intellectual strength, a tough trial court
judge with a great legal mind and an impartial quality that will
serve the court well,'' said Bush.
   ``I firmly believe that he will be a great justice,'' he said.
   In Washington, Souter met at the White House with Frederick D.
McClure, the president's chief of congressional liaison, for a
briefing on the confirmation process.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the nomination would
be officially sent to the Senate on Wednesday and Souter would then
begin visiting with Senate leaders and members of the Judiciary
Committee.
   In Philadelphia, while Bush was making his introductory remarks,
a protester arose and accused him of being a liar.
   The crowd booed and Bush quipped, ``I haven't even said anything
yet, and I'm lying.''
   ``These people feel strongly,'' he said. ``Let them have their
say, and then a little politeness should prevail and the guy that's
up here speaking ought to be given his day in court.''
   The protester apparently was upset about U.S. policy in El
Salvador.
   Bush also discussed deficit-reduction talks, saying, ``The
Congress and I are working hard to put America's fiscal house in
order, to put the spending policies that brought us to this point
behind us.''
   In Washington, Democrats involved in the negotiations appealed
to the president to tone down criticism of Democratic policies in
the interest of seeking an agreement. Fitzwater said Bush would be
``very gentle.''
   Still, in New York Bush complained of ``Democratic dominance''
which he said has caused ``government by gridlock, with spending
skyrocketing out of control, good legislation thrown aside for pork
and a budget deficit looming over our children's children.''
   He ended on a slightly kinder note, taking note of his daily
meetings with the leaders of Congress, saying ``I think they are
trying'' to reach an agreement.

<HEAD>Communists in Mongolia Rout Opposition Candidates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday that
Communist Party candidates routed most of the opposition in the
primary round of Mongolia's first multiparty election ever.
   Mongolia has been ruled by the Communists since 1921, when it
gained independence from China with Soviet help. It has remained in
the Soviet bloc since.
   Near-final results from Sunday's primary showed only 101 of the
five opposition parties' 338 candidates survived the first round,
said the vice president of the National Election Commission,
Khurmitbek.
   ``For the first attempt, it's good,'' said Zorig, leader of the
opposition Mongolian Democratic Association. He said the opposition
hoped to win 40 to 50 seats in the national legislature in next
Sunday's runoff.
   The Communist Party's chairman, Gombojavyn Ochirbat, said a
Communist victory would not end Mongolia's dramatic transformation
since December from an authoritarian, one-party state obedient to
Moscow, to a multiparty nation eager for Western contact and
investment.
   ``We are confident to say that Mongolian society is standing
firmly on the path of restructuring,'' he told a news conference.
   He, President Punsalmagiin Ochirbat and other top Communist
officials survived the primary, government officials said. The two
Ochirbats are not related.
   Most leaders of the opposition groups also won, Zorig said.
   About 2,400 candidates from all parties ran in the primary for
430 seats in the national legislature, the Great People's Hural.
Primaries were held in districts with more than two candidates. A
total of 799 survive for the second round.
   The new legislature will elect a president.
   Prime Minister Sharavyn Gunjaadorg told a news conference the
elections so far had been ``comparatively free and fair.''
   ``Of course since we are exercising this kind of election for
the first time there are some shortcomings and some bumps,'' he
said.
   Party chairman Ochirbat said he was willing for some
non-Communists to sit on the new Cabinet.
   Zorig said he had seen isolated cases of irregularities in
Sunday's primary, partly because of confusion over how to fill out
the ballots.
   ``I know a few cases where people at polling centers were trying
to suggest what person (voters) should vote for,'' he said.
   One of 19 foreign observers, Maciej Jankowski of Poland's
Solidarity, reported similar incidents but called these mistakes
rather than deliberate attempts to cheat.
   The U.S. observer team said it would make its comments to
election officials.
   Mongolia is especially eager that the election be perceived as
fair because Secretary of State James A. Baker III is to visit next
week and discuss extending most-favored nation trade status to
Mongolia.
   Formed only over the past few months, the five non-Communist
parties claim a combined membership of about 12,000, to the ruling
party's 98,000.
   Although the opposition appears to have substantial support in
cities, where half of Mongolia's 2 million people live, it has had
to scramble to reach the rural people.
   Many herders are only dimly aware of the mass demonstrations in
Ulan Bator beginning in December that forced the Communists to
agree to elections. They know even less of the anti-communist
revolutions in Eastern Europe that inspired Mongolia's opposition.
   The opposition hopes, however, to win a significant presence in
the 53-seat Small Hural, which will govern between the Great
Hural's annual sessions.
   In the Great Hural, one seat is allocated for every 2,000 rural
residents but only every 10,000 urban residents, hurting the
city-based opposition.
   The Communists recently have embraced many of the goals of the
opposition, including its demand for market-style economic reforms.

<TEXT>
   An Ariane rocket successfully
lifted a double payload of French and German TV satellites into
orbit Tuesday night, five months after a similar rocket exploded
minutes after takeoff.
   The rocket blasted off at 7:25 p.m. (6:25 p.m. EDT) from the
Ariane space center in French Guiana, on the northeast coast of
South America, and deployed the two satellites into orbit in less
than 25 minutes, officials reported.
   Ariane Flight 37 was the first launch of a European rocket since
an Ariane carrying two Japanese communications satellites blew up
less than two minutes after takeoff Feb. 22. Launches were
suspended after the accident.
   Tuesday's flight put the five-channel French television
satellite TDF 2 and the 11-channel DFS Kopernikus 2, for West
Germany's Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, into geostationary orbit _
always staying above the same spot on the Earth's surface.
   All preparations proceeded smoothly, mission chief Yvan Cherica
reported. He said the weather was good, despite worries of a storm
before the launch.
   The Ariane project has been dogged by embarrassing and costly
setbacks, including rockets that have exploded or crashed, and
expensive delays.
   But Ariane rockets dominate the private aerospace industry,
carrying about half the world's commercial payloads into space.
Arianespace, the commercial branch of the European Space Agency,
has contracts worth $2.8 billion to launch 37 more satellites.
   The French satellite launched Tuesday weighs 4,621 pounds and
will join a twin already in orbit to form a powerful relay system
that can serve 400 million television viewers, Arianespace said.
Kopernikus weighs 3,126 pounds.
   Tuesday's flight ``is important in two ways,'' said Arianespace
Director-General Charles Bigot.
   ``It is putting into orbit two satellites of the countries who
have given the most support to Ariane politically, technologically
and industrially. It is also the flight in which we pick up after
the failure of Flight 36.''
   Ariane officials say that failure was caused by a small piece of
cloth that clogged a line carrying water coolant to one engine.
   The French weekly L'Express said sabotage may have caused that
explosion, and at least two previous Ariane failures.
   Arianespace officials have said no evidence of sabotage emerged,
but technical and security checks would be intensified.
   February's failure was the fifth in the Ariane series and was
particularly costly because Arianespace had lobbied hard for the
Japanese contracts.
   Tuesday's satellites were lifted into space by an Ariane 4
rocket, the latest version introduced in 1988. It features four
strap-on boosters powered by liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, and
stands 190 feet high on the launch pad.
   A newer version, the heavy-lift launcher Ariane 5, is being
developed for planned introduction in 1995.
   Arianespace is a consortium made up of aerospace, electronics
and banking companies from 11 western European countries _ Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain,
Switzerland, Sweden and West Germany.
   Its rockets have sent into space 45 commercial satellites from
Canada, France, West Germany, Britain, India, Italy, Spain and the
United States, as well as international organizations such as
Intelsat and Eutelsat.
   Ariane is facing increased competition, however, from American
private-sector rockets including the Titan-4 made by Martin
Marietta Corp., General Dynamics' Atlas-Centaur and the Delta built
by McDonnell Douglas.
   Other rivals include China's Long March rocket; the Soviet
Union's Proton, and Japan's H-2 rocket, now under development.
   Until now U.S. rockets have mainly launched military and
scientific satellites under the supervision of the U.S. Air Force
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

   The office of an NAACP chapter was heavily
damaged Tuesday by gasoline bombs, the second firebombing eight
days, authorities said.
   The office was vacant and no injuries were reported.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, called on the public to
denounce those responsible for the fires.
   ``We ask, in the wake of this latest vicious attack against the
NAACP, when will this madness cease?'' he said.
   Hooks accused law enforcement agencies of inadequately guarding
the office in this Atlanta suburb after the first attack July 16,
when a gasoline bomb was thrown through a window. The office of the
NAACP's Clayton County chapter was vacant then and damage was
described as minor.
   Police Lt. Douglas Jewett said two Molotov cocktails were found
inside the building and two outside early Tuesday.
   The firebombing was under investigation by the FBI, the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation and local police and fire departments.
   The FBI took the case because the incidents ``could be racially
motivated and the violation of civil rights statutes could be
involved,'' said Joseph L. Coleman, a special agent in Atlanta.
   Jewett said police have not established a motive for the attacks.
   The fire burned holes in walls and destroyed furniture and
documents.
   James Jackson, president of the NAACP chapter, said he has no
plans to relocate the office.
   ``This is really ridiculous ... but we're going to stay here in
the county,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo signed legislation Tuesday
to give New Yorkers the power to designate someone to make
life-and-death medical decisions for them when they are no longer
able to.
   Cuomo's action makes New York the first state to change its laws
regarding ``living wills'' since the U.S. Supreme Court last month
ruled that the Constitution guarantees a person the right to refuse
medical treatment.
   New York was one of just nine states that lacked such a law.
   ``The choices posed by medical advances will still be difficult
... But the added anguish of legal uncertainty and confusion will
be removed for patients who have created a health care proxy,''
Cuomo said.
   The bill, effective in six months, allows New Yorkers to
designate a friend or relative to make health care decisions for
them, such as when life-support systems should be unplugged. The
proxy must be signed in front of two witnesses and two doctors must
certify a patient is no longer able to make such decisions before
the proxy can be used.
   Proxy forms will be distributed in such places as hospitals,
nursing homes and doctor's offices, said Tracy Miller, executive
director of the state Task Force on Life and the Law. The Health
Department is also printing a brochure that will explain the new
rights to people, she said.
   The legislation was passed a week after the Supreme Court, in a
decision involving a Missouri woman named Nancy Cruzan, gave a
boost to ``living will'' legislation. New York state's highest
court has said a competent adult has the right to refuse medical
treatment, even if it is life-sustaining.

<TEXT>
   A tribal court on Tuesday delayed the
election-fraud trial of suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald
until later this year.
   Navajo Judge Robert Yazzi said the election-fraud trial would be
held after two other trials scheduled for MacDonald.
   The first is set for Aug. 28 on charges he accepted kickbacks
and bribes from businesses operating on the reservation. The second
is scheduled for Sept. 25 on conspiracy charges stemming from the
tribe's July 1988 purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch in northern
Arizona for $33.4 million.
   The election-fraud trial was to have started Tuesday.
   Yazzie also postponed the trial of suspended Vice Chairman
Johnny R. Thompson, who was to have gone on trial with MacDonald on
Tuesday.
   MacDonald, who was placed on paid leave by the Tribal Council,
is charged with 93 counts and Thompson with 47 counts of filing
fraudulent campaign reports by failing to report contributions from
non-Indians and Indians in the tribe's 1986 election. The charges
also allege the funds received exceeded the maximum of $84,192
allowed.
   The proceedings were delayed after the Navajo Supreme Court
ordered Yazzie to reconsider MacDonald's indigency petition and to
appoint legal counsel to represent him.
   Yazzie ruled after reviewing the petition that MacDonald wasn't
indigent, then appointed Navajo Legal Aid attorney Peter Breen and
Farmington, N.M., attorney Doug Moeller to represent MacDonald.
   Had Yazzie declared MacDonald indigent, he could have appointed
a member of the Navajo Nation Bar to represent him without pay.
   Under the Supreme Court ruling, Breen and Moeller will be paid
by the tribe, but the tribe could seek to be reimbursed by
MacDonald later.

<TEXT>
   Assailants shot and wounded a leader of Peru's
Jewish community Tuesday, and a police officials said three
suspected Arab terrorists recently released from jail may have been
responsible.
   Jacob Hasson, director of the Israeli Union in Peru, suffered
four gunshot wounds to his left hand and arm after the gunmen
opened fire on his car, Lima Prefect Jacobo Mishkin said.
   Hasson, 60, was treated at a nearby hospital, and his wounds
were not considered serious, Mishkin said.
   Hasson's attackers were believed to include three suspected Arab
terrorists who were released from a Peruvian jail two months ago,
Mishkin said in an interview for the radio station Radioprogramas.
   An automobile carrying three men and a woman cut off Hasson's
car at 4:15 p.m. as he was driving down a major avenue in the
Peruvian capital, police said.
   The assailants opened fire on Hasson's car with revolvers and
sub-machine guns, police said.
   Hasson's car spun out of control and smashed into a sidewalk
fruit stand, slightly injuring the vendor and her 14-month-old
daughter, according to police.
   The gunmen escaped.
   Hasson has lived in Peru for 30 years and manages the Israeli
Union, a Jewish community organization. His office is in a Lima
synagogue.
   Mishkin, whose duties include Lima police chief, told
Radioprogramas that the three Arabs were arrested in Peru in July
1988 and ordered released two months ago by a judge for lack of
evidence.
   The three were arrested on suspicion of belonging to the
Palestinian terrorist group led by Abu Nidal. They were identified
as Hocine Bouzidi, 36, of Algeria; Mohamed Abdelrahman Abed, 19, of
Egypt, and Ahmad Assaad Mohamed, 19, of Lebanon.
   Peruvian officials said at the time that the three men would
probably be deported. Instead they were held for two years awaiting
trial and then released.
   Police said in 1988 that the men may have been planning attacks
against Jewish, U.S. and Israeli targets in Peru. They said
documents were found showing the men had kept the U.S. Consulate,
the Israeli Embassy and the Synagogue of Israel in Lima under
surveillance.
   Police also suspected the three men may have tried to form ties
with leftist guerrillas in Peru.
   Peruvian officials said Interpol, the international police
organization, has accused Bouzidi of being a member of Abu Nidal's
central committee and of being linked to the planning of more than
30 terrorist attacks in Europe and the Mideast since 1976.
   Among the attacks were the November 1985 hijacking of an Air
Egypt jetliner in which 59 people were killed when Egyptian troops
stormed the aircraft.

<HEAD>9-Year-Old Girl Dies After Accidental Shooting</HEAD>

   A nine-year-old girl died in a hospital early
Tuesday, two days after a stray bullet hit her in the head as she
slept in the family car following a weekend outing.
   A spokesman for the Brooklyn District Attorney's office
indicated that authorities would seek a grand jury indictment of
second-degree murder against Dorian G. Daughtry, 22. He is accused
of firing the fatal shot during a shootout in the drug-ridden East
New York neighborhood.
   The girl, Veronica Corales, was the eighth person known to have
been killed in New York City this year by a stray bullet, said
Detective Joseph Gallagher, a police spokesman.
   Veronica had been kept alive on a respirator at Brookdale
Hospital Medical Center and ``died naturally, of the trauma,'' said
Mimi Grinker, a hospital spokeswoman.
   The spokeswoman said members of Veronica's family were ``beside
themselves with grief.''
   Veronica's mother, Deborah Corales, 28, and stepfather, Daniel
Cosme, 24, had kept a vigil with other relatives and friends at the
hospital since the shooting on Sunday.
   Police said Veronica was hit as she lay sleeping next to her
mother in the family car, parked on the street shortly after
returning from an outing to Great Adventure amusement park in New
Jersey. They said a bullet pierced the car door and hit her in the
back of the head.
   Daughtry, a one-time minor league baseball prospect for the
Seattle Mariners, was arraigned in Brooklyn criminal court on one
count of attempted murder and two each of assault and criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, three hours before the girl's death
at 2:30 a.m. He pleaded innocent.
   The Brooklyn district attorney planned to urge that he be held
pending a presentation to the grand jury, said spokesman, Pat Clark.
   A requested indictment for second-degree murder, intentional or
through depraved indifference, was possible, Clark said.
   Norris Gordon, a longtime friend of Daughtry, said the arrested
man studied criminology in community college for a year, then
played outfield in 1987 for the Mariners' Class A farm team at
Bellingham, Wash. There, Gordon said, he roomed with Ken Griffey
Jr., who is now the parent club's regular center fielder.
   Daughtry was working double shifts at a state facility for the
mentally retarded in Brooklyn to support a 3-year-old son, Dorian
Jr., and debating whether to take the police tests or try out with
the Cincinnati Reds, the team that employs Ken Griffey Sr., Gordon
said.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh complained
Tuesday of the ``unwillingness'' of federal courts to punish
savings and loan fraud with long jail terms, but said punishment
was becoming tougher.
   ``We have been troubled throughout the course of this effort by
the seeming unwillingness of judges to impose stiff sentences,''
Thornburgh told the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   He was responding to criticism from the panel's chairman, Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., who cited FBI statistics showing the average
S&amp;L offender in 1989 received a sentence of 1.9 years while the
average bank robber was sentenced to 9.4 years.
   ``Whether bank robbers steal their loot with a pistol or with a
pencil _ either way they should serve hard time,'' Biden said.
   Thornburgh, making his first congressional appearance devoted to
S&amp;Ls since financial institution fraud has become a hot political
topic, said the sentences have been more to his liking since the
Supreme Court upheld federal sentencing guidelines in January 1989.
   ``Of late we have had considerable improvement in particular
cases where major executives of failed savings and loans have been
convicted of fraud,'' he said, citing several cases.
   On Friday, a federal judge in California sentenced Janet Faye
McKinzie to 20 years in prison and restitution of $13.4 million.
She had been found guilty of stealing millions of dollars from
North America Savings and Loan Association, Santa Ana, Calif.
   Last month, Woody Lemons, former chairman of Vernon Savings and
Loan Association, Vernon, Texas, was sentenced to 30 years.
   In Written testimony, the nation's top S&amp;L regulator, Timothy
Ryan, said that stiff sentences ``unfortunately ... are the
exception.''
   Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, cited a
number of examples. For instance, an Alabama S&amp;L vice president
found responsible for $2 million in losses was given one year of
unsupervised probation, he said.
   Thornburgh endorsed get-tough legislation passed 99-1 by the
Senate two weeks ago. It increases the maximum jail sentence for a
single count of S&amp;L fraud from 20 years to 30 years and establishes
a life sentence for so-called S&amp;L kingpins. They are defined as
people who acted in concert with others to steal $5 million or more.
   However, the attorney general said similar legislation moving
through the House has provisions that would interfere with the
administration's pursuit of thrift fraud.
   In a separate development, the Judiciary subcommittee on
antitrust, monopolies and business rights authorized four subpoenas
in the panel's investigation of Bluebonnet Savings Bank, Dallas, an
institution created in a December 1988 federal bailout.
   The panel, chaired by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is
looking into whether the now-defunct Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp. should have awarded Bluebonnet to James Fail, a
Phoenix, Ariz., insurance company owner.
   Fail put up only $1,000 of his own money to acquire the S&amp;L and
was selected even though a company he controlled in Alabama had
pleaded guilty to fraud in 1976.
   The subcommittee authorized subpoenas for Thomas Lykos, former
assistant director of the FSLIC, and Robert Pennington, former
president of an insurance company controlled by Fail.
   It also authorized subpoenas for Fail and Robert Thompson, a GOP
lobbyist who represented Fail in the deal, but said the two should
first be given a chance to cooperate voluntarily. The two have been
challenging whether Metzenbaum's subcommittee has jurisdiction over
S&amp;Ls.
   Metzenbaum told the subcommittee that documents in his
possession show that Thompson, a former aide to then vice president
George Bush, claimed a 2 percent interest in Bluebonnet worth
millions of dollars.
   Nancy Coffey, the senator's spokeswoman, said she could not
release the documents or describe them. Lance Morgan, a spokesman
for Thompson, declined to comment.

   President Bush's choice of David H. Souter for
the Supreme Court now heads for Senate confirmation hearings, where
the little-known New Hampshire judge is sure to be quizzed about
his views on abortion and other divisive social issues.
   Calling Souter ``a remarkable judge of keen intellect and the
highest ability,'' Bush said Monday that he and his advisers had
deemed it ``inappropriate'' to ask Souter his views on specific
issues.
   That will be the task of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
expected to hold hearings in September.
   Souter, 50, spent a dozen years as a state judge before joining
the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on April 30.

   Just as the Bush administration and Congress
are gearing up to fight savings and loan crooks, a new study
indicates that fraud caused only a small percentage of thrift
losses.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
maintains that fraud cost $5 billion, or only 3 percent of what he
figures is the bailout's $147 billion total cost.
   Most of the losses come from falling real estate values and from
excessive interest rates paid by ailing institutions to attract
depositors, he figures. Bad bailout deals made in 1988 and losses
on junk bonds also contributed.
   Fraud, nevertheless, has become the focus of political debate on
S&amp;Ls. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, making his first
congressional appearance on the subject, and top-banking regulators
were scheduled to testify on the subject today before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

   The flawed mirrors that have crippled the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope were a worry for NASA officials even
as the agency was selecting a contractor for the telescope optics,
according to a 1977 report.
   The report, released by NASA on Monday after a request by The
Associated Press, said officials selected Perkin-Elmer Corp. of
Danbury, Conn., to make the Hubble optical assembly, even though
the company planned to use an unproven computer-driven system in
the critical mirror polishing.
   Engineers for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
now believe that a flaw manufactured into one of the mirrors by
Perkin-Elmer blurred the vision of the Hubble telescope, reducing
its effectiveness by at least 50 percent. The error is now under
investigation.
   The report, signed on Aug. 26, 1977 by then-NASA Administrator
Robert A. Frosch, said the bid by Perkin-Elmer, now Hughes Danbury
Optical Systems Inc., was preferred over a bid by Eastman Kodak Co.
for several reasons, including cost.

   After a little prodding from a well-heeled health
crusader, the nation's top four hamburger chains agree: french fry
lovers need an oil change.
   McDonald's Corp. and Wendy's International announced Monday they
are switching to cholesterol-free, all-vegetable oil to cook their
fries.
   Hardee's made the change two years ago and Burger King said last
week it will no longer use beef tallow, the industry's previous
standard oil for french fry vats.
   ``Everything that's deep fried is now done in 100 percent
cholesterol-free oil,'' said McDonald's spokesman Chuck Rubner. The
company started cooking its chicken items, pies and fish in
vegetable oil four years ago, he said.

   House Republicans are divided over what
punishment Rep. Barney Frank should be given for actions on behalf
of a male prostitute, but the Democratic leadership predicts the
ethics committee's recommendation for a reprimand will be upheld.
   One conservative Republican is committed to a seemingly futile
attempt to expel Frank, D-Mass., while others are considering a
motion to upgrade the reprimand to a censure.
   On the other hand, Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, ranking
Republican on the ethics panel, said he will urge House members to
uphold the committee position for reprimanding Frank, an
acknowledged homosexual.
   The Republican leadership planned to discuss the party's
strategy at its regular meeting this afternoon. House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the Frank case would be considered
on the floor Thursday.

   A political party quit East Germany's
coalition government Tuesday and another group threatened to follow
suit in a political crisis over how united German elections should
be held.
   The Liberal Party, which controls 21 seats in the 400-member
Parliament, said it was leaving the seven-party governing coalition
of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Rainer Ortleb, charman of the Liberal faction in Parliament,
said his party's decision was based partly on de Maiziere's
``scandalous'' alliance with the deposed former Communists on the
election question.
   The dispute is over whether December elections for a single
German Parliament should be held separately in each nation, or
whether the two countries should be treated as a single electorate.

   A House panel urged a special prosecutor
Tuesday to widen the investigation of former HU Secretary Samuel
Pierce, saying it had evidence Pierce steered lucrative federal
grants to his former law firm.
   In its most detailed finding, congressional investigators
questioned whether Pierce's former law firm, a former top aide and
Pierce himself may have violated federal bribery, conspiracy and
conflict-of-interest laws during his tenure as secretary of Housing
and Urban Development.
   The panel said evidence also suggested Pierce, who served
throughout the eight-year Reagan administration, may have committed
perjury at a panel hearing when he denied involvement in the
awarding of key grants.
   ``It is obvious that Secretary Pierce did not give us the full
story,'' the panel wrote. ``However, some of his statements stand
out in that they are inconsistent and at odds with the sworn
testimony of other witnesses.''

   The government, concerned that the one skill the
industrious Japanese have yet to master is how to relax, is
offering advice on how hard workers can become happy campers.
   The Health and Welfare Ministry this week released a 38-page
report titled: ``A Study on How to Take Proper Rest and
Recuperation.'' It suggests Japanese forget about their jobs when
they leave the office and take leisurely and lengthy vacations,
concepts well-rooted in the West but yet to take hold here.
   To help the nation relax, the government report offers a wide
range of general guidelines.
   For example, it argues that constant overtime work cuts down on
sleep, adversely affects the quality of work and results in
``chronic fatigue physically and mentally, eventually leading to
bad health and illness.''

   For 80-year-old Hilda Berikoff, the
reparations she received this year for her World War II evacuation
and internment meant the end of one bureaucratic battle _ and the
beginning of another.
   Legally, reparations should have no effect on public assistance.
But bureaucratic and communication snags are costing Berikoff and
some other elderly Aleuts their Medicaid coupons and old-age
benefits.
   Berikoff said she hasn't gotten that aid for a couple of months.
``I was getting it all the time before,'' she said, ``but then when
they found out I had money in the bank, I think, I stopped getting
it.''
   At least three people in this Aleutian Island village have had
their assistance suspended or canceled by the state Division of
Public Assistance, said Marti Norton, a fee agent who helps people
correspond with the agency.
   ``A lot of these elderly people aren't familiar with paperwork
and they're being required to provide more and more information,''
said Norton. ``One person even had his case closed.''
   The number of Aleuts denied aid in smaller villages, without fee
agents, may be much higher.
   Aleuts on the Aleutian and Pribilof islands were evacuated on 24
hours' notice after the Japanese bombed Unalaska in 1942. Berikoff
said she still can close her eyes and hear bombs dropping and feel
the fear and panic.
   The Aleuts were taken to camps in Southeast Alaska. For 2{
years, the Berikoffs lived in a defunct cannery and bunkhouse on
Burnett Island. Four families shared a room with one large table;
many slept on the table, others on the floor. Berikoff stuffed
blankets under the doors to keep out the cold.
   ``They said they'd have everything for us ready in Southeast and
when we got there there was nothing,'' she said. ``I had two little
kids so it was pretty hard on me.''
   Many Aleuts returned after the war to find their homes and
belongings missing or destroyed, and the Russian Orthodox Church
vandalized. For years, they sought reparations; Berikoff was among
those who lobbied Congress.
   In 1988, Congress approved reparations of $12,000 per person, to
be distributed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
   Berikoff has arthritis. Doing without Medicaid coupons and $136
in old-age benefits each month means she has little money left
after paying bills, she said. She has spent most of her reparations
money to fix her house.
   ``I wouldn't be able to go to the clinic unless they pay,'' she
said.
   In Berikoff's case, the division sent a letter saying it would
close her file unless she provided a copy of her bank statement,
proof she received reparations and an account of what she did with
the money, Norton said.
   ``I'm really offended that they would burden an 80-year-old lady
with all of this,'' said Norton. ``This payment was supposed to
make up for wrongs. It was supposed to make their lives a little
easier.''
   Of some 550 Aleuts eligible for reparations, all but about 130
received checks by May, said Dimitri Philemonof, executive director
of the non-profit Native corporation Aleutian-Pribilof Islands
Association. The rest, he said, will be paid by next year.
   The money should not affect individuals' government aid.
Reparations are not considered income and are not taxable.
   State welfare workers were told this, but some were confused and
in at least one case benefits to an Aleut were cut off without
proper notice, said Curtis Lomas, a program officer in Juneau.
   Workers will receive new materials to reiterate the rules, he
said.
   The state must make sure that the $12,000 its public-aid clients
received were reparations, Lomas said. If the division doesn't get
the right documents, it sends letters giving clients 10 to 15 days
to respond.
   ``If it's not provided after a reasonable period of time, we
have no choice but to close the case,'' he said. ``There are people
who just don't respond.''
   Norton said some older Aleuts who receive packets in the mail
don't open them immediately.
   ``Many of them are intimidated when you get a big, fat envelope
in the mail,'' she said. ``A lot of them would put it on a dresser
for awhile and look at it because they were sure it was bad news.
Then they'd bring it to me, and a lot of times it was too late.''
   State aid forms are dense and hard to read even for people whose
first language is English, Norton said. Many elderly Aleuts speak
little or no English.
   Lomas says welfare officials ``do the best we can. We don't have
the capability of issuing notices in Aleut.''
   Reparations have created other problems. ``I think there are
some carpetbaggers out there,'' ready to pounce on people with new
wealth, Philemonof said. ``All of a sudden you've got friends.''
   Norton tells of one man who bought a gold-nugget watch and ring,
and drank away the rest of his settlement in a month. Then he had
to sell the jewelry.
   One of the biggest problems people have run into, Philemonof
said, is cashing checks in smaller villages. ``There's not enough
revenue there and they were more or less forced to come into
Anchorage,'' he said.

   A tragedy vast in scope is unfolding on the arid
plains of Central Asia, a region already unsettled by stirrings of
dissent and nationalism. This is the third article in a four-part
series based on an AP special correspondent's journey through the
Soviet south.

<TEXT>
   Beyond Bukhara's irrigated deserts, the
noble Amu Darya river dwindles down to a pathetic, poisonous
trickle, a victim in one of the world's worst ecological disasters.
   Deprived of the Amu Darya and its sister stream, the Syr Darya,
the Aral Sea is dying. Within 30 years, what was the world's fourth
largest inland sea is expected to be only a dry bed of deadly salt.
   Scientists say the sea's condition reflects a far greater crisis
across much of Central Asia, caused by years of Soviet insistence
on defying nature to plant cotton in the desert.
   Near the Aral, the effects are devastating. Authorities refused
entry to a Western reporter seeking to verify reports of the
highest infant mortality rates in the world.
   But videotape made in June by a Soviet filmmaker showed
ecological refugees in squalid camps, a hospital full of children
poisoned by their mothers' milk and whole communities disappearing.
   In some places, doctors said on film, 63 percent of the children
are sick with lung or kidney disorders, damaged livers, rickets,
pneumonia, anemia or other diseases. Sickness comes from pesticides
and defoliants, inhaled with blowing salt or swallowed with tainted
water. Mothers pass on chemicals to nursing infants.
   The physical setting has suffered as dramatically.
   Rusting hulks sit stranded on a vast desert, once a seabed, the
remains of one of the Soviet Union's richest inland fishing fleets.
No fish has been caught in the Aral since 1977.
   The filmmaker, Andrei Yatsenia, was among specialists who met in
Tashkent, late in May, to focus attention on what they agreed was
the ecological plunder of Central Asia.
   ``This is catastrophic,'' said Permat Shermuhamedov, a regional
legislator who heads the Committee to Save the Aral Sea. ``At this
rate, the sea is finished.''
   The experts blamed two problems: widespread irrigation by raw
gashes in the porous earth, which wastes as much water as it
carries, and the excessive use of pesticides, defoliants and
corrosive chemicals that pollute the remaining seawater.
   Since 1960, the Aral Sea has lost half its surface area, the
equivalent of almost two Lake Eries. Each year, winds carry
millions of tons of salt from dried lakebeds, tainting fields up to
a thousand miles away.
   Close to its former shores, the lake is already regarded as a
mass murderer.
   In parts of Karakalpakia, an autonomous region of Uzbekistan,
the official infant mortality rate is 112 per 1,000, four times the
Soviet average and higher than in most poor African nations.
   But doctors say even that figure is understated.
   ``Pediatricians in some pockets say the rate is 500. Every
second child dies in his first year,'' said Gulchehra Nurullaeva, a
poet and official of Birlik, an Uzbek grass-roots opposition party.
   Doctors link the high rate directly to health problems from the
dying Aral Sea.
   Karakalpak authorities invited a correspondent to investigate
conditions, but the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry would not grant a
visa.
   ``What can we do with the land salted and no water?'' asked one
desperate father on Yatsenia's tape, in a squatter camp of 650 mud
hovels. ``If the Aral dies, hundreds and thousands will die with
it.''
   In the moribund town of Muynak, water once lapped at the back
door of a large cannery. Now the sea is at least 14 miles away. The
plant still operates. Frozen fish are brought thousands of miles
from the ocean.
   Even here in Bukhara, 400 miles to the south, the crisis is
evident.
   Every fall, at the edge of this ancient caravan hub, the
Madaniyat Collective Farm picks its cotton crop and bundles it off
toward Moscow. And every year, the cost is higher.
   Long ago, Bukhara's Zeravshan River exhausted itself before
reaching the Amu Darya, bled by too many irrigation canals. To
replace it, a new canal was cut to drain yet more of the Amu Darya.
   Before fields can be planted, they must be washed clean of salt
and excess chemicals, which are carried down toward the Aral.
   A decade ago, a grand dream envisioned a 1,400-mile,
multibillion-dollar canal from Siberia to the Amu Darya. But that
would devastate Siberian marshes, environmentalists showed.
   With no alternate sources, Central Asia water users merely
fought harder for their allotments.
   ``The tragedy is that most of this water is just wasted, into
the desert and into the air,'' said Vladimir Kovaleyev, a geologist
who has studied the problem for decades.
   ``I shouted in Literaturnaya Gazeta in 1975, but people were
deaf,'' he said, brandishing clippings from other papers, as well.
``Today, they still are not listening.''

   The first time special prosecutor Edward J.
Kuriansky uncovered a major case of foot fraud _ an $800,000 scam
in 1985 _ he was convinced it was an aberration.
   He was wrong.
   Dr. Jeffry Simon proved him wrong to the tune of $1.8 million.
The Seigal brothers did the same with $1.2 million. And Dr. Michael
S. Greenburgh made Kuriansky $965,000 wrong.
   These four, along with dozens of other podiatric specialists,
made fortunes hand-over-feet through Medicaid rip-offs uncovered in
a state crackdown on crooked podiatrists.
   ``I heard someone refer to it as white-collar wilding, and
that's not too far off the mark,'' said Kuriansky, who was dubbed
``Medicaid Fraud's Top Gun'' in a Podiatric Staff magazine article
focusing on his efforts against corrupt foot doctors.
   But those efforts, particularly in the past year, have drawn an
angry outcry from podiatrists who contend Kuriansky has overstepped
his role of prosecutor and ``assumed the role of zealot.'' The New
York State Podiatric Medicine Association has promised to fight a
recent round of indictments brought by Kuriansky's office.
   Kuriansky and the podiatrists agree that rip-offs are not
confined to any branch of medicine. But podiatry _ due to
since-closed loopholes in state Medicaid policies _ became the most
fertile fast-buck field, Kuriansky said.
   Podiatrists looked at feet and saw golden arches during the
mid-1980s, he said.
   Doctors, who were not required to get prior Medicaid approval,
would order expensive orthopedic devices and deliver inferior
products. The most popular scam had the doctors funneling patients
to shoe stores in return for kickbacks, with everybody making a
quick illegal buck.
   ``They knew the system, they knew they weren't being watched,
and they exploited it mercilessly,'' said Kuriansky. ``There was a
feeding frenzy by podiatrists and orthopedic shoe vendors from 1983
through 1986.''
   Statistics bear him out. In 1982, Medicaid billings in New York
state for orthopedic footwear totaled $2 million; by 1985, they
skyrocketed to $30 million. That same year, podiatrists' billings
for office visits and services hit an all-time high of $35 million.
   Since the state crackdown, the figures are down to $2 million
for footwear and $17.5 million for office billings. But the
cheating goes on, as the steady flow of Kuriansky press releases
announcing new indictments attests.
   Medicaid policy changes deserve some credit for the drop, but
aggressive prosecution didn't hurt. Since 1985, Kuriansky's office
has indicted and prosecuted 137 cases involving podiatrists,
orthotic labs and orthopedic shoe vendors. The results are
astounding: 135 convictions and more than $23 million in fines and
restitution.
   Medical fraud is not a solely a New York problem; Dick Ekfelt,
spokesman for the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association in
Washington, estimates it costs more than $10 billion a year
nationally. Insurance industry estimates run as high as $80
billion, or 25 percent of the country's annual health-care bill.
   New York state, which has the nation's largest Medicaid system,
also has the highest number of Medicaid frauds, said Kevin Ryan, a
Kuriansky spokesman.
   But Steve Adler, bureau chief for medical fraud in the
California attorney general's office, said foot fraud ``might be
kind of a New York thing.''
   Such cases are rare in California. ``There's not enough so you
would notice,'' said Adler, who cited major rip-offs in the adult
diaper industry as California's biggest scam.
   Kuriansky estimated 5 percent of New York's 2,555 licensed
podiatrists are involved in fraud. Between 5 percent and 10 percent
of all Medicaid claims in the state are bogus, he speculated.
   In New York City, evidence of the problem's deep roots came when
five doctors on the faculty at the New York College of Podiatric
Medicine were indicted in a $56,000 fraud case.
   ``When you see professors engaging in the very schemes their
students are convicted of, you see a very depressing pattern,''
Kuriansky said.
   But it was that indictment that convinced the New York State
Podiatric Medicine Association that Kuriansky had gone too far,
said the group's executive director, Stanley Matek.
   ``Until this year, the cases he brought were legitimate. But
he's become the Inspector Javert of New York Medicaid, chasing
after Jean Valjean,'' said Matek, a reference to the obsessive
manhunt that is the plot of Victor Hugo's ``Les Miserables.''
   Matek concedes there was a problem when Kuriansky first started
his crusade. Foot fraud was spreading faster than fungus five years
ago, with doctors being recruited right out of medical school,
Kuriansky said.
   ``It was an interesting phenomenon. Most of them were sort of
yuppies _ young, fresh out of podiatry schools. ... They bankrolled
their early careers at the expense of Medicaid,'' he said.
   Among them was Dr. Michael S. Greenburgh, indicted in October
1988 for stealing $965,000 in Medicaid funds beginning in 1984.
Greenburgh, in an oft-repeated scenario, worked in a
poverty-stricken city neighborhood where Medicaid recipients were
plentiful. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in
prison while agreeing to make full restitution.
   One scam, run by another podiatrist, was advertised on fliers at
a city high school. Students were offered free sneakers at certain
shoe stores; the doctor would instead file for orthopedic shoes and
split the profit with the store.
   The Seigal brothers, Sheldon and Otto, were accused of making
$1.2 million in seven months through a sneaker scam. They pleaded
guilty, and were sentenced to one to three years in prison. They
also were ordered to repay some of the money they stole.
   But Kuriansky described Dr. Jeffry Simon as ``the archetypal
profiteer.'' Simon was charged with ripping off Medicaid for $1.8
million, and went to great lengths to cover up his efforts.
   When investigators closed in on Simon, the podiatrist created an
entirely bogus lab to cover up his phony Medicaid claims, filling
the room with molds made from the feet of any employee he could get
his hands on. It didn't work; he was sentenced to one to three
years.
   His indictment came two years after his first bust, the $800,000
scam that broke in 1985 and was then the largest Medicaid fraud in
history. At the time, Kuriansky felt sure it ``couldn't be
replicated.''
   He knows better now, and that knowledge is not limited to
podiatry: ``I have not found greed limited to any part of the
medical field. It's big business. That's really what's going on.''

<HEAD>Veep's Traveling Road Show Helps Fill GOP Coffers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The local McDonald's was under siege, beset
by a convergence of squad cars, police motorcycles and
plainclothesmen. Customer Lynn King, who ``just came in to get a
shake,'' thought there must have been a shootout.
   Instead, she found Dan Quayle and his traveling road show. The
vice president was buying iced tea, shaking hands and introducing
youths in tank tops to the Republican who wants to be Texas
attorney general.
   ``Do you know Buster Brown?'' Quayle asked, pulling the
candidate along as he distributed vice presidential pens and signed
autographs for excited onlookers.
   Soon Quayle whisked his entourage on to more lucrative pastures
at a nearby hotel. He sat for press interviews and then helped
Brown, a state senator, collect more than $100,000 for his campaign
from well-heeled GOP faithful.
   About 250 people paid $100 each to eat hors d'oeuvres and hear
Quayle speak at a stand-up reception. Sixty others forked over
$1,000 each for a more exclusive reception where they were
photographed with Quayle. An elite 20, $2,500 contributors, got to
sit on stage while he spoke.
   It was a typical morning on the campaign trail with Quayle. The
vice president, who has battled for credibility ever since George
Bush selected him, is on the road with increasing frequency as he
devotes himself to electing other Republicans.
   Since early this year, Quayle has averaged a couple of days a
week stumping for gubernatorial, state and congressional candidates
across the country.
   He is credited with raising some $12 million for party groups
and candidates over the past 1{ years. He has been in 42 states and
made return trips to places with high priority races.
   He has bolstered his savvy staff by hiring an operative with
respected political credentials, Michigan state party chairman
Spencer Abraham, to coordinate his travels.
   While Quayle conducts some official business on most trips,
``The political trips drive the whole schedule,'' said his press
secretary, David Beckwith.
   By combining vice presidential events with politicking, the vice
president can charge part of his travel to the taxpayers. The
political part is charged to the Republican Party organizations.
   Quayle's principle mission is raising money. He also generates
considerable local media coverage, like the page-one Austin
American-Statesman photo of him holding a child in McDonald's.
   The Republican National Committee touts him as immensely
successful on the money front.
   ``He really is extremely popular among the party types, the
state chairmen,'' said B.J. Cooper, a spokesman for the committee.
``He's very effective wherever he goes.''
   ``He has been a very, very effective fund-raising tool,'' said
Ed Rogers, who oversees political operations at the White House.
   Quayle's assignment is not to swing votes or lead rallies.
Rather, he focuses on filling GOP coffers in a year when both
parties are jockeying for the upper hand in preparation for the
redrawing of legislative district lines.
   Even Democrats, who insist Quayle is a policy lightweight, give
him backhanded credit for political skill.
   ``Our sense is they are using him almost solely to stoke the
fires in their own political base camp,'' said Mike McCurry,
spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. ``He's very
successful.''
   While Quayle says that to a large extent ``the novelty factor
has worn off'' following relentless negative press early in his
tenure, it seems the curiosity factor still draws people to see him.
   ``Many people don't know whether what they've read about him is
true,'' said Lee Yaekel, GOP chairman in Travis County, Texas.
   ``A lot of people want to meet him ... know a little bit about
him.''
   As for raising money, Yaekel said, ``The vice president of the
United States is the vice president of the United States'' and
wealthy Republicans are going to shell out top dollars to see him.
   In Raleigh, N.C., Republicans had only two weeks notice that
Quayle was coming to town, just a few weeks after President Bush
had campaigned there for Sen. Jesse Helms.
   Despite the close timing of the two visits, the party managed to
get 18 people to put up $2,000 each for a private reception and
photo with Quayle, and 270 people to pay $125 each for a luncheon,
said Andy Wright, state GOP political director.
   Although he carefully avoids discussing the topic, Quayle also
reaps personal benefits through his nationwide travel.
   Aides privately acknowledge that the politicking gives Quayle a
chance to establish a network of supporters for his own future, as
Bush did in making himself the heir apparent to Ronald Reagan.
   Beckwith refused to comment on whether Quayle is laying that
kind of base. But he allowed, ``Loyal party-building work served
George Bush well.''
   Quayle, too, sidesteps questions about his aspirations.
   ``I would acknowledge that it's building up friendships. It's
building up contacts. I know people all over the country now that
are quite supportive of me _ and supportive of George Bush, and it
doesn't hurt the president to have the vice president out there
making friends all the time,'' he said.
   In the meantime, a more polished, practiced Quayle is emerging.
His stump speech, a call to arms for the Bush agenda and for making
GOP headway in the Democratic-controlled Congress, is paced for
applause lines. He delivers it in a more natural style than the
stiff Quayle of months past.
   At every stop, he meets with local reporters and sits for TV
interviews, smoothly giving the administration line on the issues
of the day.
   He appeared momentarily stumped when a TV reporter asked how, if
he did not know Buster Brown very well, he could give him such a
laudatory recommendation.
   Quayle recovered quickly, saying that Bush knows Brown, and
``the president's word to me is golden.''
   Local reporters, while sometimes complaining that he glosses
over issues, often express surprise at his smoothness and
unflappability.
   ``He was a little bit sharper than I thought he would be,'' said
John Gonzales, a reporter based in Austin for the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.

<HEAD>Showdown Over Water Pits Las Vegas Against Rural Counties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is high noon and 108 degrees in the shade at
the ritzy residential compound called Spanish Trail, a vista green
and wet almost as far as the eye can see: past the golf course, the
artificial pond, the bubbling fountains and the pristine pools _
right up to the edge of the desert.
   There is water, water everywhere in Las Vegas.
   It runs off neat lawns from sprinklers going full-blast at the
hottest time of a scorching day. It rolls down sidewalks and
gutters and streets and evaporates like a gambler's stake, never to
be seen again.
   While the West Coast suffers through the fourth year of a
drought that has people feeling guilty for taking showers and
flushing toilets from San Diego to San Francisco, Las Vegas _ a
city dry and dusty as a neon bone, save for its share of Colorado
River water _ has been busy doubling the number of golf courses and
building 4,000-room hotels.
   But now its unstoppable growth and unquenchable thirst have
thrust America's desert playground into a bitter power struggle
with the rest of Nevada, a showdown being played out in states all
over the West. Urban takes on rural in a water war some say
threatens to tear Nevada apart.
   ``If you work on the premise, `Let's not do anything about
future water supply and let's just let it run its course, and when
we run out, then we'll have to stop' _ that's economic homicide,''
said Pat Mulroy, general manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water
District, which regulates water in much of Clark County.
   The region's explosive growth caught the water district with its
hydrological pants down.
   Its allocation from the Colorado River, the seemingly endless
bounty that has kept the area afloat and awash for years, suddenly
appears to be insufficient in the wake of a two-year growth spurt
that has brought 6,000 new residents each month.
   ``Why didn't we see this sooner? It just fell on us, absolutely
fell on us,'' Mulroy said. ``The first year we thought, that's got
to be construction water because of all the massive construction
going on. So in the second year, 1989, we finally said, `Wait a
minute! Something's got to be done.'''
   What the district did was ask the state water engineer to grant
it the rights to an ocean of unappropriated groundwater in 20,000
square miles, most of it in Nye, Lincoln and White Pine counties,
three huge rural areas to the north. The plan involves constructing
1,200 miles of pipeline over the next 30 years to transport that
water out of the desert and to the people.
   The multibillion-dollar project _ its cost is placed at between
$1.5 billion and $7 billion, depending on who's estimating _ is
described as three times the size of the huge Central Arizona
Project, which carries Colorado River water over the mountains to
Phoenix and Tucson.
   And it is at least five times the size of the disastrous Owens
County water grab by Los Angeles 77 years ago, the legendary
scandal that inspired Roman Polanski's movie ``Chinatown.''
   ``You can put taxes on us. You can do anything to us,'' said Nye
County Commissioner Dick Carver, a life-long rancher. ``But you
take my water, I'm done. I can't exist.''
   In Nevada, where water is lifeblood and ultimate power, water
law is a century old. Applications for water rights must be
approved by the state water engineer, who decides whether the
applications meet three criteria: Is the water unappropriated?
Would rights affect any existing rights? And are the appropriations
in the public interest?
   So far, his meetings with the counties have ended in shouting
matches.
   ``They're more than upset; they're outraged,'' said State Water
Engineer Mike Turnipseed, who could start making decisions on the
applications as early as this fall. ``They fear more than just the
basic idea of `You're stealing my water.' They feel it's a threat
to their economic existence.''
   The counties believe their future already is in Clark County's
hands. Any business that wants to move in needs water. If the water
rights are approved, the rural counties will have to ask Clark
County for it. If the dispute ends up in court, as both sides
believe, the water might be tied up for years.
   ``Basically, you end up with somewhat of an annexation of the
counties,'' said George Benesch, an attorney for the rural areas.
``It scares the counties to death.''
   Scares them so much, in fact, that they have turned to their
sworn enemies for help. Ranchers and miners, whose battles over
water date back 100 years, have joined forces. And they've enlisted
the aid of others who they have often considered adversaries:
environmentalists and the federal government.
   ``We've had the Sierra Club come in with the wilderness issue,
and we fought wilderness,'' Carver said. ``But now we're saying,
`Won't you please come and help us? Because without water, what
good's a wilderness area?'''
   Their greatest allies, in fact, may turn out to be the inch-long
pupfish _ the last 400 or so of which live in Devil's Hole National
Monument near Death Valley _ and other endangered species on
federal land. Clark County has said it plans to temporarily remove
more groundwater than is replenished over time, a process park
officials say can upset delicate ecological balances.
   ``The water source at Devil's Hole is so sensitive, the drop of
the water table there a matter of inches could expose the rock
shelf on which the algae grows that is the pupfishes' only source
of survival,'' said Ed Rothfuss, superintendent of Death Valley.
   The federal Bureau of Land Management, which controls most of
the land in Nevada, plans to protest most if not all the
applications, as do the National Park Service and the Fish and
Wildlife Service. When Clark County asks to use federal land, the
Bureau of Land Management has the power to order an environmental
impact statement, which the counties hope could stop the project
for good.
   ``Where the battle is going to be fought, probably in court, is
the decision of what is in the public interest,'' said Steve
Bradhurst, a planning consultant hired by the rural counties to
coordinate their attack.
   More than anything else, perhaps, it is the spectre of the Owens
Valley that most frightens the rural counties. Agents for Los
Angeles secretly bought up water rights in 1913; now Los Angeles
ships almost all the valley's water 250 miles south via two giant
aqueducts.
   The valley's thriving agricultural landscape was reduced to a
noxious dustbowl by the depletion of its water. Decimated and
nearly dead, it remains one of the oldest surviving symbols of
urban greed and contempt for the rural areas in the West. Despite
the water district's assurances that it would never happen,
Nevada's counties fear they might become the newest one.
   ``Las Vegas has to be crazy if they think we're going to lay
down and watch them do this to us,'' said Carver, who raises
alfalfa and cattle on his 860 acres in Nye County.

<TEXT>
   In a state with few people, the city with the
most wins the power game. In Nevada, that makes Las Vegas the
undisputed champ.
   Las Vegas, which welcomes as many as 6,000 new residents a
month, is the reason Nevada is the nation's fastest-growing state.
The city's population is expected to reach 1 million by 1995, four
times what it was in 1980.
   An estimated 800,000 people live there now, out of 1.3 million
in the state as a whole. The three rural counties fighting Clark
County's water plan have a combined population of less than 35,000.
   That means Clark County controls the Nevada Legislature: 36 of
63 state lawmakers are from the Las Vegas area, and the contingent
is sure to grow with next year's reapportionment. So what Clark
County wants, Clark County has the numbers to get.
   ``If there's something in state water law we can hang our hat on
to deter this plan, the power is in Las Vegas and Clark County and
they'll just go ahead and change the law,'' said Steve Bradhurst, a
consultant to the rural counties.
   Las Vegas also is the state's financial anchor. Last year, Clark
County casinos accounted for 70 percent of the state's $4.6 billion
in gaming revenues. Clark County needs to keep growing for the
state's economic health, officials say.
   ``There is one large metropolitan area from which the bulk of
all revenues in this state come, and that's Clark County,'' said
Pat Mulroy, manager of the Las Vegas Valley Water District. ``If .
.. it goes downhill, the whole state goes downhill.''

<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS number of tourists in 1st graf to 18 million. The
first take, b0537, will not be retransmitted.</NOTE>
<HEAD>LAS VEGAS: Nye County.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nye is the third largest county in the nation, with a population
that averages one person for each of its 18,000 square miles. Las
Vegas' population of 800,000 is expected to reach 1 million by
1995, supplemented by some 18 million tourists a year.
   At that rate, Clark County's Colorado allocation of about
300,000 acre feet _ an acre foot is about 326,000 gallons, the
amount of water it takes to cover an acre to the depth of one foot,
enough to supply a family of four for a year _ will last just into
the 21st century, with some conservation, the water district
estimated.
   Changing the Colorado River Compact would take an agreement by
other states that share the water, an unlikely scenario. California
drains the basins south of Las Vegas, leaving ``barely enough water
for two hotels,'' Mulroy said. The only option, she said, was
unappropriated groundwater in Nevada.
   ``If you say the valley needs an additional supply, where does
it go? It has nowhere else to go,'' Mulroy said. ``This really is
the extremes, where you've got one community that has no
alternative, and where the entire state is dependent on the
economic livelihood of that community. Clark County's economic base
is the state's economic base.''
   Opponents of the plan believe that Clark County's Colorado
water, plus properly conserved water from basins within its own
borders, would last well into the next century.
   They scoff at the district's first-ever conservation plan, which
introduces tiered water rates that hit big users, landscaping and
building requirements and public education campaigns. Artificial
lakes have been banned, and officials are allowed to turn off
sprinklers if water is running into the streets. ``A conservative
first time out,'' Mulroy calls the plan.
   The constant flow of tourists helps make the city's water
consumption among the nation's highest: 380 gallons per person each
day, more than twice as high as Tucson and 50 percent higher than
Phoenix.
   But tourists aren't the only reason for that figure. Las Vegans
have always had more water than they needed, and they have used it
with gusto. Ponds, fountains and pools abound. There are at least
21 golf courses in and around Las Vegas, twice as many as six years
ago. Hotels and housing are popping up as fast as the desert can be
graded.
   ``All the contracts on the Colorado River are built around
developing your water resource _ the use-it-or-lose-it theory,''
Mulroy said, adding that 80 percent of the area's water comes from
the Colorado. ``So Nevada's water contracts ... are structured
around a race to use and develop that water, to stake your claim to
it.''
   Rural Nevadans care little about why Clark County wastes water,
or about efforts to scale back. They are just galled by the
injustice of it.
   ``It makes us sick,'' Carver said. ``You go to Las Vegas, they
water 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And it runs down the
streets.''
   The bottom line, however, is that Clark County has the people
and the power. Even State Engineer Turnipseed acknowledges that any
decision he makes could be overturned by the county's powerful
legislative contingent. The rural counties know that, but they have
no intention of giving in.
   ``There have been lives lost in the West over water. And we can
see that kind of feeling here,'' Carver said. ``What it's going to
be now is a civil war.''

   An attorney representing a GOP lobbyist
involved in a controversial savings and loan bailout asked the
Senate Ethics Committee on Monday to investigate whether Sen.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, or his aides struck a ``sordid deal''
to share investigative material with The New York Times.
   Attorney Stanley M. Brand, representing lobbyist Robert J.
Thompson, a former aide to then-vice president George Bush, asked
the panel to ``initiate an ethics inquiry into improper conduct
which reflects upon the Senate, and which may include violations of
federal and state law by ... Metzenbaum or ... Senate staff
members.''
   Metzenbaum chairs the Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust,
monopolies and business rights, which is looking into Thompson's
involvement in negotiating the bailout of 15 thrift institutions
now combined under the name of Bluebonnet Savings Bank, Dallas.
   Meanwhile, the Times reported in Tuesday editions that Thompson
invested $100,000 with a federal regulator, Paul G. Heafy, who also
was involved in Thompson's negotiations to buy an insolvent bank in
Oklahoma. The newspaper reported that the investment, which was to
buy distressed loans from federal regulators, did not violate
conflict of interest laws, but Senate investigators wanted to look
into the financing of the deal.
   Heafy is chief liquidator for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in Oklahoma City. He and Thompson refused the Times' requests
for interviews.
   Brand said there is ``substantial probability'' that New York
Times reporter Jeff Gerth obtained access to confidential
investigative information from Brian McTigue, an aide to
Metzenbaum. The information, including private financial records,
was obtained ``under the cloak of Senate authority'' and was
``released ... inappropriately'' to the Times, Brand said.
   In December 1988, Thompson represented James M. Fail, a Phoenix,
Ariz., insurance executive, who acquired the thrifts. Fail paid the
government $1,000 of his own money and $70 million in borrowed
funds to obtain Bluebonnet, which was bailed out with a government
subsidy estimated at $1.8 billion.
   The now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board selected Fail as
the acquirer over a competing group even though an insurance
company he controlled had pleaded guilty to fraud in 1976 in
Alabama.
   The New York Times ran a front-page story on questions
surrounding the Bluebonnet deal July 8, the day before Metzenbaum's
subcommittee held its hearing.
   ``It now appears indisputable that sensitive investigative
information ... gathered in the name of the U.S. Senate, was
deliberately, intentionally and inappropriately given to a major
national newspaper,'' Brand wrote.
   ``If this type of investigative information ... (is) released
maliciously to reporters it can cause incalculable harm to private
persons. This is exactly what appears to have happened in this case
... (in) what can only be described as a sordid deal to provide the
Senate's investigative information to a single newspaper in return
for favorable coverage on the eve of the Senate's hearing,'' he
wrote.
   Brand based his complaint, in part, on a statement from Cable
News Network reporter Brooks Jackson, who said he was told by
Metzenbaum's staff that they had made an exclusive arrangement to
share information with Gerth in exchange for an agreement that the
Times would hold the story until the day before the hearing.
   Jackson, who was quoted in Saturday editions of The Washington
Post, said he was quoted accurately but declined to reveal which
Metzenbaum aide had told him about the arrangement with the Times.
   McTigue declined to comment, referring questions to Metzenbaum's
press spokeswoman, Nancy Coffey. Gerth also declined to comment and
referred inquires to Howell Raines, the newspaper's Washington
bureau chief.
   Raines said, ``As a matter of policy, we don't discuss sources
or the editorial process.''
   He said the story was ``meticulously researched from a number of
sources'' and ``was industriously and honorably reported.''
   Coffey said Metzenbaum considered Brand's complaint too
ridiculous to comment on.
   ``Since when is it against the law for a senator to talk to one
reporter?'' she asked, adding that ``no prearrangements'' were
attached to Metzenbaum's comments.
   ``Nobody's rights were harmed here,'' she said. ``Mr. Thompson
is complaining because he is in trouble right now. There are a lot
of people with a lot of questions about how Mr. Fail was able to
get such favorable deals with his background. Those are legitimate
questions.''
   Wilson Abney, staff director of the ethics committee, said he
could not reveal what action the panel was taking on the complaint
or even if it had been received. He said typically complaints are
referred to staff attorneys, who can then recommend whether or not
the complaint should be investigated.
   Meanwhile, Metzenbaum's panel is continuing its investigation
and has scheduled a second hearing for Tuesday afternoon. So far,
Thompson and Fail have declined to appear before the subcommittee
and are disputing its jurisdiction over the matter.

   A sharp turnaround on stock market psychology is
seen as a key reason for the latest jolt by the Dow Jones
industrial average. The nation's best-known stock barometer had
toyed with breaking a record high just a week ago.
   The average plunged more than 100 points within the first 90
minutes of trading on Monday, recouped part of the loss and yo-yoed
through much of the day in heavy trading. It finished down 56.54
points to 2,904.70.
   Strategists called the volatile selloff a scary reminder of
weaknesses in the market that surfaced late Friday, when the Dow
average fell abruptly after a long runup that did not seem based on
any strong economic reason.

   The House has voted to limit the amount of
advertising on children's television shows, which one lawmaker
complained have become ``the equivalent of a Toys R Us catalog.''
   By a voice vote, the House approved legislation Monday that also
would require regulators to weigh, in renewing the licenses of
television stations, how well broadcasters are serving the
educational needs of children.
   The bill and a similar measure approved by the Senate last week
effectively would reverse the Reagan administration's deregulation
of the commercial content of children's TV programming in 1984.

   Resorts' plan filed in December under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code would give bondholders 78 percent of the company,
dropping Griffin's ownership to 22 percent. Resorts, in turn, will
exchange the $911 million in debt held by those bondholders for a

   Nine Swiss bank employees bought Contel Corp.
securities in the days before GTE Corp. announced a deal to acquire
the company, a Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer said
Monday.
   The employees of Union Bank of Switzerland were the latest to be
mentioned in the SEC's investigation of alleged insider trading
that preceded disclosure of a $6 billion merger of Contel and GTE.
   The disclosure was made during a hearing at which a U.S.
District Court judge issued a preliminary injunction extending a

   ``Genius grant'' recipient Richard
Stallman is noted as much for his eccentricities as he is for his
prodigious talent as a computer programmer.
   He can be found in his cluttered office, his hair long and
matted, his bare feet cradling an open box of crackers on the cot
where he sleeps.
   Stallman, 37, last week was among 36 recipients of MacArthur
Foundation grants.
   Stallman, who will receive $240,000 during the next five years,
is more than a gifted nerd.
   In an era when his genius could earn him millions, Stallman
eschews material possessions and leads a crusade for ``free''
computer software.
   ``Clearly, I could have gone to some company and made a lot of
money,'' said Stallman, sitting cross-legged on a couch outside his
office.
   ``But I'm more interested in a certain quality of life. When a
program is free, a community of enthusiasts develops,'' he said.
   The term ``free software'' does not refer to cost, but to the
idea of being able to openly share information about computer
techniques and applications, in contrast to commercial software
applications, which are restricted and sometimes patented. With
free software, people can trade programs and information freely,
not unlike the idea of one person buying a cassette tape or a CD
and allowing others to copy them.
   Without free software, Stallman argues, computer enthusiasts are
unable to improve existing programs because their knowledge is
restricted. The brave new world pioneered by freewheeling computer
``hackers'' in the 1970s led to a static commercial ethic that
threatens future progress, he said.
   ``It's not in the public interest, everything has turned into a
commercial trade secret,'' he said.
   Stallman is one of the founders of the League for Programming
Freedom, which has 135 members.
   The group is planning a protest march Aug. 2 at the Cambridge
headquarters of Lotus Development Corp. A federal judge recently
sided with the company, ruling it illegal to develop a program that
uses the same commands and menus as an existing program.
   Stallman sees himself as a true hacker.
   A Harvard graduate, he began working on the computer system at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1971. In the highly
charged atmosphere of MIT's artificial intelligence community, he
was a legendary hacker, usually at his keyboard 10 hours a day,
seven days a week for years.
   Eighteen months ago, he developed tendinitis in his hands and
now must employ a typist to carry out his commands.
   ``I'm determined not to let it stop me,'' he said in an
interview.
   He earns what can be considered little more than stipend money
by working occasionally as a consultant, but only on what he
considers free software. He has no grand plans for the
no-strings-attached grant, apart from a trip to the Soviet Union,
where he was invited to meet with programmers.
   He recalls the early days in the mid-1970s as near-Utopia in the
hacker community. But around 1980, when many hackers cashed in on
their talents and went corporate, Stallman found himself a maverick.
   ``All software was originally free,'' said Stallman. ``There was
a real communal feeling. Then, in the '80s, it all changed.''
   But Stallman stuck to his ideals. He left MIT in 1983 to begin
working on the development of his own system of free software. His
products are priced far less than comparable systems, he said. He
has a staff of 15 people.
   ``What I set out to do was to make a complete free system,''
Stallman said. ``I want to use nothing but free software.''
   In the rare hours when he leaves the computer pulsing in his
tiny cubicle, Stallman socializes with other hackers. He has had a
girlfriend for the past year, unusual for him, he said.
   His farewell is always the same: ``Happy hacking!''

<HEAD>Aspin's Attack on B-2 Further Clouds Prospects for Aerospace
Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The call by the head of the House Armed
Services Committee to build only the 15 B-2 bombers now in the
production pipeline is the latest cloud to darken the skies over
California's aerospace industry.
   Northrop officials said Monday's speech by Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., is just the latest word in a long debate over the bomber's
importance as the Cold War ends.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed building 75 B-2s,
down from the 132 originally envisioned.
   So far only one B-2 has been completed, and it would take
several years for the program to be phased out even if Aspin and
other opponents cap production at 15 operational planes.
   Northrop already had announced plans to decrease the 12,700
people working on the B-2 program as it moves from its development
phase to production.
   By year-end, Northrop plans to lay off 1,400 of the 10,500
workers at the Los Angeles suburb of Pico Rivera, where the plane
was developed. But it will add 800 employees to the 2,200 now at
Palmdale in the immense desert factory where final assembly takes
place on the manta ray-like, radar-evading bombers.
   Those layoffs, announced this month, are part of a
long-established decline in aerospace employment here.
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. is slicing about 10,000 jobs in the area
and Lockheed Corp. as many as 7,000 over the coming years. Hughes
Aircraft, TRW and Rockwell International had made big job cuts in
Southern California before this year.
   At Northrop itself, peak employment of 48,200 came at the end of
1987. After cutting 2,500 employees during the past year, Northrop
announced in May it would eliminate another 3,000 jobs, many of
them related to the B-2.
   Chamber of Commerce economist Jack Kyser said Los Angeles and
Orange counties have 10,000 fewer aerospace jobs now than at this
time in 1989. By the end of the year the loss is expected to be
17,000 jobs, he said.
   ``I am surprised that the cuts are coming so fast,'' said Kyser,
whose forecasts generally are at the positive end of the spectrum
of economists' predictions.
   ``It's almost like the aerospace firms see the storm warnings
coming and they're cutting back and getting into shape.''
   Kyser said that it's generally believed that each job lost at
prime contractors leads to another two or three layoffs at smaller
aerospace companies. ``We're seeing a real scramble in the
subcontracting area,'' he said.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said Northrop subcontracts
about 70 percent of the work on the B-2. Nationwide, between 30,000
and 40,000 people are employed in connection with the plane, most
in California, but others at Boeing in Washington, LTV in Texas,
General Electric in Ohio, and elsewhere.
   Cantafio repeated arguments by B-2 proponents that the $830
million-plus cost figures routinely given for each plane are
misleading. Much of that money was absorbed by the costs of
devising new technology to make the plane nearly invisible to
Soviet radar _ costs that are the same whether 132 planes or none
are built, he said.
   The 15 B-2s now in the pipeline would cost $35.8 billion total,
``but for $27.1 billion more you get 60 more airplanes,'' Cantafio
said.
   Northrop gets about half of its more than $5 billion in yearly
revenue from the B-2. That heavy reliance on one program is cited
as one of the company's biggest weaknesses, along with its $800
million debt load.
   Lawrence Harris, an aerospace analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill
Richards in Los Angeles, said capping the B-2 program would
generate enough cash to erase that debt as Northrop reduced
inventories, collected receivable accounts and sold equipment back
to the government.
   Cantafio agreed. Without the B-2 program, Northrop ``would be a
much smaller company, with a much stronger balance sheet,'' he said.
   But if that were to happen and Northrop also lost the
competition against a team led by Lockheed Corp. to build the
next-generation advanced tactical fighter, the company would
plummet from the ranks of major aerospace contractors.
   ``Then Northrop returns to where they were in the late 1970s _
major subcontractor,'' Harris said.

   A Senate leader called on the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to
work out their differences after a report faulted both agencies for
their conflicting analyses of last October's stock market slide.
   A General Accounting Office report found that differences in the
SEC and CFTC studies stemmed from ``subjective interpretation and
judgment.''
   The two rival agencies, which have been embroiled in a
jurisdictional dispute, each issued reports last month analyzing
the Oct. 13 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
   Both studies differed in their conclusions and both agencies
later lambasted the other's methodology, prompting a Senate panel
to request a study of the issue by the GAO, the investigative arm
of Congress.
   ``SEC and CFTC emphasize different factors and take different
points of view to reach their conclusions. This sometimes results
in different conclusions, each of which is supported by basically
the same trading data,'' said the GAO report, which was released by
the securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee.
   The SEC reported that index arbitrage and other program selling
strategies significantly worsened the market decline while the CFTC
reported that neither program trading nor futures sales explained
the sharp price movements on the day of and first trading day after
the drop.
   Index arbitrage is a computerized program trading strategy that
seeks to take advantage of small differences between the stock and
futures markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market
while selling in the other.
   Stock index futures, often used in program trading strategies,
allow investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks
without having to buy the underlying stocks.
   ``The GAO report finds the SEC-CFTC jurisdictional dispute
continues to detract from their working relationship,'' said Sen.
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the subcommittee.
   ``The agencies' major differences threatens their ability to
work together to minimize risks to the capital markets. This
untenable situation must be resolved,'' he added.
   Spokesmen for the SEC and CFTC denied that their feud was
hurting their ability to work together on other issues.
   ``We don't feel that the ongoing debate has compromised the
commission's ability to work with its sister agency, the SEC,''
said CFTC spokesman David Gary. ``That fact has most recently been
shown by today's market activity,'' he said referring to a more
than 100-point drop in the Dow during the early hours of trading
Monday.
   ``Our staff people have talked to the exchanges. (CFTC Chairman)
Wendy (Gramm) has spoken with (SEC Chairman Richard) Breeden, and
when appropriate we have passed along information that was
necessary for the SEC to do its job,'' said Gary.
   SEC officials declined to comment because they had not seen the
final report but they noted that except for the dispute over stock
index futures the agencies ``get along wonderfully.''
   The Bush administration wants to strip the CFTC of its authority
over stock index futures and give it to the SEC.
   The SEC said it stood by written comments on an earlier draft of
the GAO report.
   In a letter to the GAO, Richard Ketchum, the director of the
SEC's Market Regulation Division, maintained that the SEC's
findings ``are amply supported both by detailed analyses of
specific trade data and extensive interviews with relevant market
participants.''
   Ketchum's letter then went on to criticize a letter by CFTC
Chairman Gramm last month that faulted the SEC study as
``misleading'' and ``contradictory.''
   In its study, the SEC concluded that index arbitrage and other
program trading strategies accelerated the 6.9 percent market drop
and accounted for an unusually high percentage of share volume
during the 90-minute slide.

   Tumbling prices tripped ``circuit breakers'' on
the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
prompting brief trading halts that are designed as safeguards
against a market crash.
   Like the stock market, which sometimes leads and sometimes
follows the futures markets, stock-index futures closed Monday well
above their lows of the day. The index futures mimicked the Dow
Jones industrial average, which fell more than 100 points in early
trading and finished with a loss of about 56 points.
   At 10:34 a.m. EDT, about one hour after trading opened in the
Merc's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures pit, the contract for
September delivery dropped to 12 points below Friday's settlement
price.
   Under the Merc's rules, if the price of an S&amp;P 500 futures
contract falls 12 points, trading is allowed only at or above that
level for a period of 30 minutes.
   A similar episode occurred on the Chicago Board of Trade, which
trades the Major Market Index futures contract. The August MMI
contract hit its downside limit of 20 points at 10:40 a.m. and fell
no further all day, settling at 58.869, off 11.21 points.
   The contract is valued at $250 per point.
   Stock-index futures are contracts for future deliveries of
baskets of stocks. They allow investors to speculate on
stock-market movements without actually owning stocks.
   The Merc's S&amp;P 500 futures are the nation's most widely traded
index futures.

<TEXT>
   A Securities and Exchange Commission probe into
alleged insider trading preceding GTE Corp.'s announcement of a
deal to buy Contel Corp. has prompted an investigation into another
major takeover bid.
   SEC attorney James A. Kidney said Monday that the commission is
looking into trading activity surrounding the July 2 offer by
Ratners Group PLC, Britain's largest jewelry chain, to buy Kay
Jewelers Inc., a retailer based in Alexandria, Va., for $328
million.
   Some of the foreign accounts that are the subject of the
Contel-GTE probe also ``seem to have been doing a lot of trading in
Kay Jewelers,'' Kidney said.
   The lawyer made his comments while seeking a preliminary
injunction to continue freezing accounts the SEC has identified as
holding the illegally obtained profits in the Contel-GTE case. U.S.
District Judge Charles Haight Jr. granted the injunction.
   Kidney said nine Swiss bank employees bought Contel securities
in the days that preceded disclosure of a $6 billion merger of the
company and GTE. They were the latest to be mentioned in the probe.
   The SEC alleged in court papers filed July 13, the day after the
Contel-GTE merger was announced, that ``individuals or entities
whose identities are yet unknown'' used inside information about
the deal to make profits of at least $1 million.
   On Friday, the SEC named four West Germans and three European
entities that allegedly traded Contel securities based on inside
information about the then-undisclosed buyout.
   One of the Germans has told investigators he overheard a
conversation about the pending merger at a restaurant, Kidney said.
   Kidney said other individuals or companies that ordered the
purchase of large blocks of Contel securities through European bank
accounts have not yet come forward.
   He said it could take months before they were identified because
the U.S. government would have to use international treaties to
force the banks in Switzerland, West Germany and Luxembourg to
identify their customers.
   He said Union Bank of Switzerland was cooperating in the
investigation and had interviewed six of its nine employees who
bought Contel call options on July 10 and 11 for their own accounts.
   A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a stock or stock
index at a set price before a certain date. Because Contel stock
jumped in price after the buyout proposal was revealed, a buyer of
its call options at the pre-announcement price could reap big
profits after disclosure of the deal.
   The six Union Bank employees were identified as Frederic
Galliard, Alfred Keller, Rolf Koechli, Phillip Colliard, Thierry
Racine and Oliver Roth.
   Bank attorney John Dickey said the employees, most of whom
worked in the bank's trading department in Geneva, bought the
securities because they noticed an increase in Contel call option
trading and because a ``substantial customer'' had placed a large
order for Contel securities.
   The customer was not identified.
   The three other Union Bank employees had not been interviewed
because two were on vacation and one was recovering from injuries
from an automobile accident, Dickey said.
   The West Germans named Friday by the SEC are: Ortwin Heider of
Hofheim; Hans-Jurgen Klisch and Hannelore Mirbach-Krahn, both of
Meerbusch and Bodo Pawlik, of Ratingen.
   The SEC complaint also identified three entities accused of
violating insider trading laws: Union Investment, a Dusseldorf
mutual fund; and two companies with offices in Switzerland, Nalasag
Corp. in Geneva, and Sigesse SA in Lausanne.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 50 Pennsylvania corporations have
decided to exempt themselves in whole or part from the state's
tough anti-takeover law and the list is growing as Thursday's
deadline for acting approaches.
   By Monday, 47 companies had said no to embracing the full law,
and more companies were expected to join the ranks, according to
William A. K. Titelman, an attorney who lobbied against the law and
is now tabulating the companies who are opting out.
   Among those taking the action are roughly half of the
Pennsylvania companies on the Fortune 500 and Standard and Poor's
500 lists.
   ``The more the Pennsylvania business community has gotten to
know the bill, the more they dislike it at least for themselves,''
Titelman said in a telephone interview.
   But Bill Baer, vice president for government affairs for the
Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, which championed the
law, said ``it was agreed that this was not going to be one size
fits all'' and companies were going to decide what was in their
best interest.
   Enacted in April, the law gave publicly traded companies until
July 26 to decide. Privately held companies have a year to make up
their minds.
   The law, regarded as the nation's toughest against hostile
takeovers, for the first time requires unsuccessful raiders to
surrender their profits if they sell the stock within 18 months of
the attempted takeover. The clause is aimed at so-called
greenmailers who target a company they hope will buy back its
shares at a premium to make the raiders go away.
   Raiders who gain 20 percent or more of a company will not get
voting rights until other stockholders approve. And company
directors can balance the interests of stockholders, employees and
others in weighing a takeover bid.
   Investor groups bitterly fought the bill, arguing it would
depress stock values. But proponents said it was vital to stopping
profit-hungry financiers from gobbling up Pennsylvania companies,
breaking them up and destroying jobs and communities.
   Impetus for the law came from lawmakers intent on saving
Armstrong World Industries of Lancaster from a takeover bid by the
Belzberg family of Canada. The Belzbergs have since abandoned their
plans. Titelman, a partner in the Klett Lieber Rooney &amp; Schorling
law firm of Pittsburgh, represented the Belzbergs.
   State Sen. Noah Wenger, R-Lancaster, who sponsored the law, said
he hoped companies weren't being lulled by the slowdown in hostile
takeovers and would remember that takeovers could start anew if
financing again became available. ``Some may feel the protections
are not as needed as they were a few years ago,'' Wenger said.
``That may be deceptive.''
   William George, president of the AFL-CIO, which succeeded in
adding job protection sections to the law, said investors have
pressured some companies into exempting themselves. He also noted
that some companies that were presented as needing protection have
since exempted themselves.
   When lawmakers were considering the bill, proponents said
Conrail was an example of a Pennsylvania company that needed
protection, and the argument swayed votes to the bill.
   But July 18, Conrail's board announced it was exempting itself
from the sections stripping raiders' profits, also known as
disgorgement, and blocking immediate voting rights for a raider,
known as control shares.
   Company spokesman David Neurohr said Conrail felt initially that
the bill moving through the Legislature was ``a mixed bag,''
although the company supported it. But once optional features were
added and remained in the law, the Conrail board felt compelled to
choose those that are in the best interest of the company,
employees and community, Neurohr said.
   Among the top companies opting out of all sections of the new
law are H.J. Heinz Co., PNC Financial Corp., Westinghouse Electric
Corp., and the Reading Co.
   Companies opting out of disgorgement and control shares include
Allegheny Ludlum Corp., Dravo Corp., Duquesne Light Co., Kennametal
Inc., and Mellon Bank.
   The Sun Co. has opted out of disgorgement.
   Despite the decision of its board to push for the law, the
Chamber of Business and Industry was by no means unanimous on
accepting all its provisions.
   Richard Ross. Jr., the chamber's chairman, announced Monday that
his company, First Eastern Corp., had opted out of the disgorgement
and control shares sections of the laws.

<HEAD>House Combines, Passes Securities Reform Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has passed legislation giving the
Securities and Exchange Commission new powers to impose fines for
illegal activities beyond insider trading. Less than a week earlier
a similar bill cleared the Senate.
   The House also passed legislation that would crack down on penny
stock fraud.
   The penny stock bill, which combined two earlier bills cleared
through committee last month, was passed on a voice vote by the
House Monday.
   The Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990
also would give the SEC authority to order alleged wrongdoers to
``cease and desist'' illegal activities without first having to go
to court and obtain a restraining order.
   The legislation would widen SEC authority to seek court orders
barring convicted securities law violators from serving as officers
or directors of companies with publicly traded stock.
   The Senate passed a bill last week giving the SEC similar
authority to fine, issue cease and desist orders and ask courts to
bar crooks from serving as corporate officers.
   A separate penny stock bill also is pending in the Senate.
   The penny stock provisions of the House bill would give the SEC
the power to bar crooked promoters and consultants from selling the
highly speculative stocks which usually sell for $1 or less.
   Penny stocks are not traded on most stock exchanges. The bulk of
the information obtainable about them comes from the brokers sho
sell them. While not illegal, penny stocks _ which typically are
used to finance new or small companies _ are considered to be very
risky at best.
   The House bill would allow the SEC:
   _ To close a loophole that now allows unscrupulous penny stock
brokers to evade SEC removal from the securities business by
calling themselves promoters or consultants, which the SEC has no
power to regulate.
   _ To tighten disclosure requirements for highly speculative
investments known as ``blind pools'' and ``blank checks.''
   ``In their combined form, these two bills represent a powerful
expansion of the enforcement weapons available to combat the
problems of securities fraud in general and the penny stock market
in particular,'' said Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who sponsored
the initial penny stock legislation along with Reps. Matthew
Rinaldo, R-N.J. and Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   The other half of the bill originally was introduced by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee which oversees the SEC.

<HEAD>Casino Company Announces Bondholder Approval of Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc.'s
bondholders have approved a reorganization plan that will give them
78 percent of hotel and casino company, leaving entertainer Merv
Griffin with the rest.
   The reorganization is part of the casino company's plan to
emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
   The plan, approved by bondholders Monday, must still be
confirmed at a hearing scheduled today at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Camden, and approved by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission as
well as the government of the Bahamas.
   The plan would give bondholders 78 percent of the company,
dropping Griffin to 22 percent ownership. Resorts, in turn, will
exchange the $911 million in debt held by those bondholders for a
reduced debt service of $430.3 million.
   The plan, filed in December and amended in April to include the
proposed sale of Resorts' Paradise Island operations in the
Bahamas. Resorts officials estimated Paridise Island could fetch
between $250 million and $300 million for the struggling company.
   ``Now that our bondholders have approved our plan, we are
looking forward to obtaining the court's approval,'' Resorts
President David Hanlon said in a news release. ``Our reorganization
should be complete by the end of the summer, and we will focus all
of our energy on making Resorts the finest resort, and the best
investment, it can be.''
   Bondholders have said the plan is the best way to get some
return on their investments.
   The plan gives senior secured bondholders $292.8 million in new
notes and 2.5 percent of Griffin's shares. Those bondholders
approved the plan with 98.4 percent of the vote, representing 99.9
percent of the principal they owned, Resorts said.
   Holders of Resorts' highest paying bonds, 16| percent, would
receive 32.4 percent of the shares and $58.9 million in new bonds.
Those bondholders approved the plan with 90 percent of the vote
representing 98.5 percent of their principal amount.
   The remaining bondholders would get 43.1 percent of the company
stock and $78.6 million in new notes. They approved the plan with
89.8 percent of the vote representing 93.6 percent of the principal
amount.
   The plan also sets aside a legal kitty of $5 million to pursue a
possible fraudulent conveyance action against Donald Trump, who
swapped Resorts to Griffin for the newly opened Taj Mahal Casino
Resort next door on the Boardwalk.
   Resorts had expected that the April 2 opening of the Taj Mahal
would bring more customers to that end of the Boardwalk but that
has failed to occur. The casino continues its slide of declining
gross gaming revenue, or ``win'' when compared to the same time
period the year before.
   The casino has posted lower win figures each month for more than
a year, with the latest month down 12.7 percent from June 1989,
according to the state Casino Control Commission. For the year
through June 30, Resorts has pulled in $97.7 million in gross
gaming revenues, an 11.9 percent drop from the first six months of
1989.
   The company recorded a $3.1 million loss for the first quarter
of 1990 on overall operating revenues of $107.6 million. Resorts
had a loss of $18.7 million in the first quarter of 1989 on overall
operating revenues of $113.5 million.

   Ford Motor Co. expects to finish negotiations
with a New York company in the next three months to sell its Ford
Aerospace Corp. subsidiary.
   If negotiations with Loral Corp. are successful, Ford will join
Chrylser Corp. in getting rid of its non-automotive,
defense-oriented subsidiaries.
   Loral and Ford announced Monday that the New York City-based
defense electronics company was chosen for intensive negotiations
from three finalists, one of which included a subsidiary of General
Motors Corp.
   ``Now that we've narrowed it down to the single bidder, we begin
a negotiations process with them,'' Ford spokesman Tom Rhoades
said. ``We hope we'd be able to wrap it up in the next three
months.''
   Loral issued a statement from New York saying it will form a new
corporation with the merchant banking operations of Shearson Lehman
Hutton of New York to acquire Ford Aerospace. Each will contribute
about $150 million of equity. The balance, which was not disclosed,
will be financed.
   Loral would have the option of increasing its stake later, the
company said.
   The Los Angeles Times said in Monday editions that Loral's
proposal involves $800 million in cash and an assumption of Ford
Aerospace liabilities that would add another $500 million to the
offer.
   The newspaper said Ford was seeking $1.2 billion in cash.
   Chrysler sold its main defense contractor, Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., in February for $825 million. Ford and Chrysler said in
putting the subsidiaries up for sale that they wanted to
concentrate on designing, building and selling cars and trucks.
   The subsidiaries were put on the block as Defense Department
orders began shrinking.
   GM, the nation's largest automaker, said it has no intention of
selling its primary defense contractor, GM-Hughes Electronics Corp.
   In fact, GM-Hughes was part of a joint effort with Alcatel Co.
of France as one of the three final bidders for Ford Aerospace. The
third was a consortium of Westinghouse Electric Corp., the
investment firm Carlyle Group and Aerospatiale of France, which is
connected to the Airbus aircraft.
   ``Loral's offer was the best financially and meets all of our
requirement,'' Ford Chairman Harold Poling said in a statement
Monday. ``The sale is for the whole of Ford Aerospace Corporation _
a fundamental objective for us throughout the sale process.''
   Poling said Loral had agreed to keep pay and benefits for Ford
Aerospace's 17,000 employees in force for at least two years.
   Ford declines to supply earnings figures for Ford Aerospace, but
said the Newport Beach, Calif.-based company received about $1.8
billion in contract awards. At year's end, it had a backlog of
about $2 billion in contracts.

   Continental Airlines announced it is cutting its
nationwide fares up to 57 percent during the next three weekends.
   The Houston-based carrier's sale fares range from $39 to $129
one way. They are first available for travel beginning Thursday,
Friday or Saturday and ending Saturday, Sunday or Monday.
   Continental said the fares also apply to travel beginning Aug.
2-4 and returning Aug. 4-6; and beginning Aug. 9-11 and returning
Aug. 11-13.
   The sale fares are available on virtually all mainland U.S.
flights and some international flights.
   For example, the fare from Boston to Austin, Texas, will be $99
each way, compared with a regular low fare of $182 each way. That's
a savings of 46 percent.
   Continental also is offering some international weekend sale
fares. The sale fare from Houston to Acapulco is $69 each way,
while travel from Newark, N.J., to Bermuda is $99 each way.
   ``The enormous popularity of our most recent weekend sale fares
for travel between hub cities have encouraged us to offer a weekend
sale for travel nationwide,'' a Continental spokesman said.
   Continental said seats are limited. Tickets must be purchased on
Tuesday or Wednesday and within 24 hours of making a reservation.
   A round-trip purchase is required, and tickets are
nonrefundable. Travel must occur on the same weekend.

   The 1990 farm bill sent to the Senate by its
agriculture committee is surviving major changes.
   The Senate was debating an amendment today that would reduce
guarantees to sugar producers from 18 cents a pound to 16 cents.
   The House, meanwhile, faced more than 100 amendments in taking
up its version of the bill today.
   On Monday, the Senate defeated an amendment that would have made
significant changes in the section on ``sustainable'' agriculture,
that system of farming the seeks reduction in chemical use.
   The proposal offered by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, would
have weakened a provision was meant to enhance government
activities to encourage sustainable agriculture. It was defeated,
60-32.
   The Senate defeated, 62-29, an amendment by Sen. Harry Reid,
D-Nev., to discontinue use of animals for acute toxicity testing in
product safety experiments.
   Opponents said the measure said it was a Commerce Committee
problem that should make its way to the floor through that panel,
not as an addition to the farm bill.
   The Senate approved amendments that would:
   _Authorize $250,000 to study the effects of timber harvesting
and deforestation in the New York and New Jersey highlands.
   _Make wood products eligible for agricultural export programs.
   _Require that the Agriculture Department phase in changes in
research programs so that by 1993, the Agricultural Research
Service is spending 20 percent of its budget on alternative crops
and products. The bill authorizes $730 million annually for the
service during the five-year life of the bill.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., criticized the Agriculture Department
as oriented too much toward increasing crop yields.
   ``We produce so much we don't know what to do with it,'' Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, said in support of the amendment. ``This says
we want to channel some of this research into non-food uses.''
   Products that are under development now include using corn as a
substitute for road salt, soybean oil as a pesticide carrier and
corn and wheat starches to make products biodegradable.

   Ford spokesman David Krupp also said Monday the average light

money that would involve. The increases were outlined to dealers
who are placing orders for 1991 vehicles now.
   In addition to the vehicle price increases, Ford said delivery

<TEXT>
   Reuters Holdings PLC, the British news agency and
financial information services group, said Tuesday that earnings
jumped 27 percent in the first half of the year, helped by strong
sales in all major markets, particularly Europe.
   Reuters said earnings for the six months ended June 30 totaled
108 million pounds or $188 million, compared with 85.3 million
pounds or $148 million in the same period a year ago.
   Sales gained 26 percent to 688.3 million pounds or $1.2 billion
from 548.3 million pounds $954 million.
   The company said sales strength was partly due to the relative
weakness of the pound during the period. That makes British
companies more competitive in selling products and services in
other countries.
   The pound has since moved up to 18-month highs against the
dollar and nine-month highs against the German mark. On Tuesday,
the pound was quoted at $1.82.
   Reuters noted in its statement that ``conditions in financial
markets remain difficult and cancellations of Reuter services,
which were already high, have recently risen further.''
   The company didn't break out quarterly results. It isn't
required to under British law.
   The figures were converted at the company-provided exchange rate
of $1.74 to the pound.

   The stock market opened tentatively today as
investors sifted for bargains through the wreckage of Monday's
selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 5.70 at
2,910.40 at 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 464 up, 511 down and 522 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.65 million shares after the
first 30 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE's index of all its listed issues was almost unchanged
at 194.21, off 0.01. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index gained 0.26 to 355.18.
   Market watchers expect continued volatility today because
traders lack a compelling reason to buy or sell heavily. Some
stocks battered Monday could benefit from selective buying,
analysts say.
   In the early going, McDonald's was unchanged at 33, stabilizing
after Monday's steep slide. The hamburger chain reported
unexpectedly poor quarterly results late Friday, prompting
investors to dump the stock Monday in heavy trading.
   Elsewhere among the heavily trading blue chips, General Electric
fell { to 72, Philip Morris dropped \ to 48}, International
Business Machines shed | to 115\ and Exxon was up ~ to 48}.
   Dow Chemical tumbled 4| to 53{ after reporting a 50 percent
plunge this morning in its second-quarter earnings.
   Disappointing corporate earnings reports released recently set a
negative tone in the market Monday and acted as one of the
catalysts causing the setback that had the Dow industrial average
off more than 100 points in morning trading. The average managed to
regain about half of its early loss.
   By the close Monday, the oldest and best known measure of trends
in stock prices, stood at 2,904.70, down 56.44 points from last
week's close.
   Concerns that inflationary pressures may be building at a time
of economic weakness contributed to the bearish outlook on Wall
Street.
   Computer-aided program trading also played a part in the selloff
and added to the volatility.
   On Monday, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 6 to
1 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks Monday, with 227 up,
1,430 down and 365 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 209.03 million
shares, up from 177.81 million Friday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.43 to 194.22. The American Stock Exchange's market value index
closed at 354.92, down 5.53.

   A scary drop in stock prices has resurrected
memories of market instability and suddenly cast doubt on the
ability of the Dow Jones average to decisively crack the 3,000
barrier.
   But investment strategists say elements that caused the price
tumble Monday had been building for awhile. Many said they didn't
presage any significant bailout from the stock market unless
there's some unforeseen economic calamity.
   ``We're at or slightly below the levels where we closed at the
end of June,'' said David Edington, a portfolio manager at Pacific
Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif.
   The Dow average, the most widely watched barometer of the
market's direction, dropped more than 100 points early Monday and
sent shock waves throughout the financial markets. But the index
regained half the loss by the end of the day and closed down 56.44
points at 2,904.70.
   Still, it was the biggest one-day point loss for the average in
six months and a sharp turnaround in psychology from last week,
when the Dow average neared closing above the 3,000 mark for the
first time.
   Trading was tentative when the market opened today amid
expectations of continued volatility. The Dow was up 5.70 at
2,910.40 in the first half hour of dealing as investors searched
for bargains in the wake of Monday's selloff.
   Equities markets overseas appeared to have a mixed response to
Wall Street's Monday decline. Japan's 225-share Nikkei Stock
Average fell 192.33 points today, losing 0.60 percent to close at
31,702.46 following a 526.72-point loss on Monday.
   But in London, stocks were higher around midday as cash-rich
institutions took advantage of cheaper prices created by Monday's
drop in New York. At about noon local time, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 11.6 points, or 0.5
percent, at 2,371.3.
   Lawrence Helfand, a senior strategist with the Rodman &amp; Renshaw
investment firm in Chicago, said he had been expecting a
correction. ``I anticipate (Monday's drop) is part of that
correction. There's lots of negative news around, with no real
reason to anticipate any positive news.''
   Broader measurements of the stock market also dropped Monday for
reasons ranging from from a rash of disappointing corporate
earnings, to revived fears of higher interest rates, to continued
anxiety over the federal deficit.
   Many strategists also called the drop a classic Wall Street
symptom known as ``Blue Monday,'' the tendency for prices to fall
right after weekends. In this case, the excuse to sell was
aggravated by the market's sudden weakness late Friday.
   ``It's the kind of shakeout we've had before,'' said Robert
Farrell, chief market analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.
``I don't think it's the start of a really big decline.''
   Many attributed the volatility in stocks to the use of
high-volume computerized strategies known as program trading, which
critics say can severely exaggerate price movements.
   The Dow drop helped cause a similar decline in the stock-index
futures market, where traders bet on the direction of stock prices
by buying and selling contracts based on market indexes. The
futures drop activated a ``circuit breaker'' that briefly halted
trading in the Standard &amp; Poor's stock-index contract.
   The New York Stock Exchange also requested voluntary compliance
with its proposed ban on computerized selling tactics in a falling
market.
   The circuit breakers were put in place to forestall a collapse
like that of Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987. The NYSE proposal for
voluntary program trading halts has been awaiting federal
regulatory approval for several months.
   It was unclear what effect the NYSE's request had Monday, but
Sharon Gamsin, spokeswoman for the nation's largest stock market,
said ``by and large, it appears there was compliance.''
   Although the Dow average is the most widely recognized yardstick
of the stock market, it had recently surged ahead of broader, more
important measurements of the stock market's health. Therefore,
many strategists weren't surprised by the size of the average's
drop.
   ``The market is sick and it's been camouflaged by the phobia for
3,000,'' said Stan Weinstein, a widely followed strategist who
publishes the investor newsletter Professional Tape Reader. He
accurately forecasted the 1987 plunge.
   ``I'm not telling you you have to have a crash,'' Weinstein
said. ```I'm just saying, when you have this kind of stuff, the
caution flags are flying.''

<TEXT>
   Wages, salaries and other benefits paid to
American workers shot up 5.2 percent in the 12 months ending in
June, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, considered
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures, was pushed
ahead both by rising wage costs and higher benefit costs.
   The 5.2 percent jump was well above the 4.5 percent increase of
a year ago for the 12-month period ending June 1989, the department
said.
   Today's report was sure to add to analysts' worries that the
nation is suffering from entrenched inflation. Last week, the
government reported that consumer inflation has risen 5.9 percent
so far this year, well above the 4.6 percent inflation rate for all
of last year.
   In another sign of higher wage pressures, the Labor Department
said today that major collective settlements reached so far this
year provided average wage increases of 3.8 percent over the life
of the pacts, up from a 2.5 percent average increase the last time
those contracts were negotiated.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., called the
government's data on rising labor costs ``more of the same story on
inflation.''
   ``The message is that there is no relief in sight ... it is
stable, but stable at a high and entrenched rate,'' Sinai said.
   Following the bad news on inflation last week, analysts said it
was unlikely the Federal Reserve would be able to stray any time
soon from its inflation-fighting campaign and lower interest rates.
   The 5.2 percent rise in the cost index for private industry
workers covered total compensation, which includes wages, salaries
and the employer costs of providing such benefits as health
insurance.
   The wage and salary component of the index climbed by 4.5
percent in the 12 months ending in June while benefit costs rose a
sharper 6.9 percent.
   Part of the jump in wages and salaries reflected the rise in the
minimum wage that took effect April 1, when the minimum wage went
from $3.35 an hour to $3.80 an hour, the Labor Department said.
   However, the impact of that increase _ the first rise in the
minimum wage in 10 years _ was probably minimal, the agency said.
   Workers in the service sector of the economy fared better than
the manufacturing sector in pay gains, the government said.
   Service industries saw wages and salaries go up by 4.6 percent
in the past 12 months compared to a 4.2 percent rise for the
manufacturing sector.
   In part, that gain reflects the fact that service industries
have been more affected by shortages of workers in the past year.
   However, there was a wide fluctuation in both the services and
manufacturing categories. Wage increases ranged from 2.3 percent in
transportation to 6.3 percent in health services in the service
industry, while pay gains ranged from 2.9 percent in construction
to 4.8 percent in non-durables manufacturing.
   Non-union workers received better wage gains than their union
counterparts, continuing a trend that's been ongoing since 1983-84,
the government said. Non-union workers' pay rose 4.8 percent while
union workers saw gains of 3.3 percent.
   The 5.2 percent increase in total compensation for private
industry over the 12 months ending in June matched the 5.2 percent
rise in the 12 months ending in March.
   The 4.5 percent rise in wages and salaries was faster than the
4.1 percent increase from a year ago and the 4.2 percent increase
for the year ending in March.
   The 6.9 percent jump in benefit costs was down slightly from the
7.2 percent increase for the 12-month period ending in March, but
well above the 5.6 percent increase of a year ago.
   Pressures of wage inflation have intensified every quarter since
June of 1988, when the Employment Cost Index rose above the 4
percent level for the first time.
   In part, analysts blame rising wage and benefit costs on a tight
labor market that is forcing employers to spend more to recruit and
keep workers.

<HEAD>Posts 10 Percent Profit Rise in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PepsiCo Inc. said Tuesday its earnings for the
second quarter rose 10 percent from a year ago on a 17 percent
sales gain, led by double-digit advances in the snack food and
restaurant divisions.
   The company, whose largest business is soft drinks, said it
earned $292.5 million, or $1.10 a share, in the three months ended
June 16 compared with $264.9 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $4.20 billion from $3.59 billion
a year earlier.
   The latest results were reduced by a $5.5 million after-tax
charge resulting from a customer bankruptcy, while the 1989 results
were boosted by $22.2 million mainly resulting from the company's
decision to keep rather than sell a bottling operation in Japan.
   Soft-drink sales rose 8 percent to $1.6 billion but operating
profit fell 3 percent to $233.2 million.
   If one-time items are excluded from both years, operating profit
from soft drinks would have been up 15 percent.
   Domestic soft drink sales rose 5 percent, including a 4 percent
gain in bottler case sales that were driven by double-digit growth
in the Diet Pepesi products, strong gains in Mountain Dew and a
solid Pepsi brand performance.
   International soft drink sales rose 23 percent.
   Snack foods sales climbed 24 percent to $1.2 billion, including
sales from Smiths and Walkers acquired last year, while operating
profit rose 18 percent to $226.2 million.
   Excluding Smiths and Walkers and onetime items in both years,
sales and operating profit would have each risen 12 percent.
   Domestic sales rose 6 percent, while international sales more
than doubled, helped by a strong volume increases and lower
commodity costs. Its brands include Chee-tos, Santitas and Crunch
Tators.
   Restaurant sales rose 22 percent to $1.4 billion while operating
profit rose 36 percent to $228.6 million. Excluding the impact od
onetime items, operating profit would risen 25 percent.
   Sales rose 25 percent to $676 million at the Pizza Hut chain, 21
percent to $399 million at Taco Bell and 18 percent to $358 million
at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   For the first half, PepsiCo said it earned $474.4 million, or
$1.78 a share, up 10.2 percent from $430.0 million, or $1.62 a
share, a year ago.
   Revenue for the first half rose 20 percent to $7.88 billion from
$6.55 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Seeks Class-Action in Asbestos Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. is seeking
class-action status for 65,000 asbestos-related claims to avoid
arguing the same issues repeatedly in individual cases.
   The company said Monday it has filed a request for class-action
status with U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in New York, who
last week was given authority to reorganize the Manville trust.
   The $3 billion trust, which was formed as part of the 1988
bankruptcy reorganization of Manville Corp., has run out of money
to pay about 130,000 new claims. Manville was driven into
bankruptcy court by thousands of lawsuits by victims of
asbestos-related diseases.
   Eagle-Picher, which reported settling 7,800 asbestos claims in
the first six months of the year, said it believes the Manville
trust will have to participate in the settlements.
   A federal judge in Cleveland recently authorized creating a
national class-action to settle more than 100,000 asbestos lawsuits
crowding U.S. court dockets. Negotitations have begun on
structuring the settlement mechanism.
   Eagle-Picher has been inundated with lawsuits by people who say
their health suffered from exposure to an asbestos-based pipe
sealer Eagle-Picher made for ships during World War II.
   Eagle-Picher said its own settlements for the first half of the
year averaged $5,900. About 11,300 new plaint too ridiculous to comment
on.
   ``Since when is it against the law for a senator to talk to one
reporter?'' she asked, adding that ``no prearrangements'' were
attached to Metzenbaum's comments.
   Meanwhile, the Times reported in today's editions that Thompson
invested $100,000 with a federal regulator, Paul G. Heafy, who also
was involved in Thompson's negotiations to buy an insolvent bank in
Oklahoma.
   The newspaper reported that the investment, which was to buy
distressed loans from federal regulators, did not violate conflict
of interest laws, but Senate investigators wanted to look into the
financing of the deal.
   Heafy is chief liquidator for the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. in Oklahoma City. The Times said he and Thompson refused the
Times' requests for interviews.

   Stocks traded tentatively today as investors
sifted for bargains through the wreckage of Monday's selloff.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks traded within a
narrow range and was up 0.50 at 2,905.20 at 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
An hour earlier, the average sported a gain of 5.70 points.
   Declining issues maintained a small lead over advances on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 588 up, 621 down and 544 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 51.62 million shares after the
first 90 minutes of trading.
   The NYSE's index of all its listed issues shed 0.09 to 194.13.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained 0.20
to 355.12.
   Market watchers expect continued volatility today with traders
reacting to fresh reports from the corporate front. Some stocks
battered Monday could benefit from selective buying, analysts say.
   Disappointing corporate earnings reports released recently set a
negative tone in the market Monday and acted as one of the
catalysts causing the setback that had the Dow industrial average
off more than 100 points in morning trading.
   The average managed to regain about half of its early loss. By
the close Monday, the oldest and best known measure of trends in
stock prices, stood at 2,904.70, down 56.44 points from last week's
close.
   Concerns that inflationary pressures may be building at a time
of economic weakness contributed to the bearish outlook on Wall
Street. Computer-aided program trading also played a part in the
selloff and added to the volatility.
   The parade of poor earnings reports continued this morning as
Dow Chemical posted a 50 percent plunge in its second-quarter
profit. The stock tumbled 4~ to 53\ and led the Big Board's list of
active issues with more than 1.5 million shares changing hands.
   Sears, Roebuck, which also said its quarterly income was off,
was unchanged at 33|.
   Meanwhile, McDonald's regained &lsqb; to 33&lsqb;, stabilizing after
Monday's steep slide. The hamburger chain reported unexpectedly
poor quarterly results late Friday, prompting investors to dump the
stock Monday in heavy trading.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today reported a 39
percent drop in second-quarter earnings, blaming the weakness on
high insurance payouts and a decline in retailing income.
   The retailing and financial services conglomerate reported
earnings of $237.9 million, or 69 cents per share, for the three
months ending June 30 vs. $391.2 million, or $1.11 per share, for
the same period a year ago.
   Revenues rose 4.3 percent to $13.9 billion from $13.3 billion,
Chicago-based Sears said in a statement.
   The year-ago results included a gain of $56.3 million, or 16
cents per share, from discontinued operations.
   Ten days ago, Sears announced it expected second-quarter
earnings to be about 65 cents per share.
   Sears said earnings were depressed by unexpected
catastrophe-related losses in its Allstate Insurance Group.
   The company also cited a weaker performance by its Sears
Merchandise Group, the nations' largest retailer. The retailing
operation reported a 32 percent drop in operating income, to $110
million from $162 million.
   Retailing revenues rose about 2 percent to $7.9 billion from
$7.7 billion, Sears said.
   For the first six months of 1990, Sears earned $344.2 million,
or $1 per share, on sales of $26.5 billion, vs. $648.9 million, or
$1.81 per share, on sales of $25.4 billion in the first half of
1989.

   President Bush and congressional leaders met
for two hours today in hopes of spurring a deficit-reduction
compromise, but a top House negotiator later said ``fundamental
disagreements'' remain.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., also said that
President Bush's recent attacks on congressional Democrats at
Republican fund-raising events aren't helping the process of
finding a compromise.
   ``One of the things discussed today was to stop the political
debate and start the substantive debate and to try to cut down on
the political comment that's gone on on all sides,'' Gephardt told
reporters outside the White House.
   Bush himself seemed downbeat, refusing to answer questions at a
picture-taking session at the start of today's meeting. ``Don't
even try, I'm in a bad mood today,'' Bush told reporters. He did
not elaborate.
   Bush has been lashing out at Democrats and the congressional
budget process in a series of GOP fund-raising speeches. In fact,
he was attending similar events today in Philadelphia and New York.
   Gephardt said that Bush had agreed to cool down his attacks and
``I think you're going to see that happen.''
   Flying to Philadelphia aboard Air Force One, White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would be ``very gentle''
toward the Democrats in his campaign speeches.
   ``They're working in a spirit of harmony and compromise. In
fact, they agreed this morning at the meeting that they would try
to keep the rhetoric under control and really try to make this a
productive week of work,'' Fitzwater said.
   Gephardt, who is the leader of the ``budget summit''
negotiations when Bush is not present, said he still thought it
possible that accord could be reached by early August, when
Congress begins its summer recess.
   ``But I don't know for absolute sure that we can do that,'' he
added. ``It may be that we can't get all of it done. But we're
going to give it the good old college try.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said decisions remain to
be made on the precise amount of deficit reduction that would be
sought, and how much of the savings would come from new taxes and
spending cuts. Bargainers have said they expect any compromise to
contain about $50 billion in savings, divided in half between
revenues and spending reductions.
   ``I don't think there is at this point a clear definition of
what each side wants,'' Foley told reporters.
   Gephardt said budget negotiators would meet again on Capitol
Hill later today. He said a smaller group including top House and
Senate leaders and the president would meet again at the White
House on Wednesday morning.
   ``We'll try to work both groups together as we try to work
toward a solution of the problem,'' he said. ``There are still some
very difficult areas of discussion that will be hard to close on.
This is not easy to do.''
   ``There are fundamental disagreements'' on taxes, spending cuts
in entitlement programs and on defense spending levels, the
Democratic leader added.
   Gephardt said the president did not offer any specific proposals
on new taxes at today's session.
   The Oval Office session also included Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine; Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.;
and House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.
   After 11 weeks of bargaining, there is still very little
agreement on specifics, Gephardt conceded.
   The two sides have made no decisions about where they will find
$50 billion in new taxes and spending cuts for fiscal 1991, which
starts Oct. 1.
   Bush met with congressional leaders last Wednesday in hopes of
advancing the negotiations. But since then, the two sides have done
little but argue.
   The House's 176 minority Republicans voted informally that same
day to oppose any tax increases as part of a budget-cutting
package. Democrats said that vote hurt the talks by casting doubt
on whether GOP lawmakers would eventually support a compromise.
   Negotiators met last Thursday but spent the closed-door meeting
yelling at each other, participants said. And Friday, on a Western
campaign trip, Bush accused congressional Democrats of causing the
recent run of $150 billion a year-plus budget shortfalls, prompting
Democrats to fire back.
   The budget negotiators hope to produce a package within the next
two or three weeks, when Congress' August recess begins. But
bargainers concede it will be hard to accomplish that goal.

   Times Mirror Co. Vice Chairman Tom Johnson, who
has spent most of his career in print journalism, was named today
as as president and chief executive of Ted Turner's Cable News
Network.
   Johnson, 48, who began at the Macon Telegraph and News in his
native Georgia, will succeed Burt Reinhardt, 70, on Aug. 1.
Reinhardt has been with the all-news cable network since Turner
began it 10 years ago and became its president in 1982.
   Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System,
announced Johnson's hiring in Seattle, where he is attending the
Goodwill Games sports competition his company is sponsoring.
   Reinhardt will become vice chairman of CNN and advise Johnson
during the latter's transition into his new job. Reinhardt plans to
retire later, a CNN spokeswoman in New York said.
   The Atlanta-based CNN, the 24-hour all-news network, reached
53.8 million U.S. households last year. It says it reaches 90 other
nations.
   Johnson would leave his job as chairman of Times Mirror's
newspaper management committee. Last year, he stepped down as
publisher of the Los Angeles Times after nine years in that post.
   Turner, who conducted a yearlong search for Reinhardt's
replacement, spoke with Johnson about three weeks ago and the job
was offered to him Thursday, the Los Angeles Times said.
   Johnson leaves Times Mirror after 17 years, 13 of them at the
Los Angeles Times. During his tenure as publisher, the newspaper's
revenue tripled from $333 million to more than $1 billion.

   Stock prices finished slightly higher on London's
Stock Exchange Tuesday after an anticipated early advance on Wall
Street failed to materialize.
   Shares shot higher from the outset, rebounding from Monday's
deep losses. But the gains were undermined by the uninspired Wall
Street start, dealers said.
   The Dow Jones industrial average struggled for most of the
morning session in New York, vacillating between small gains and
losses.
   By the close of the London session, the Dow Jones average was up
3.47 points at 2,908.17.
   On Monday, the Dow average lost 56.44 points to close at
2,904.70, after falling as much as 107 points during the session.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 1.2
points, or 0.05 percent, to close at 2,360.9.
   The index's session peak was 2,378.1 and its low was 2,351.8.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was off 0.4 point at 1,866.7
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 0.64 point
to close at 1,273.22.
   Volume came to 385.7 million shares compared with 369.8 million
shares Monday.

   Aerospace manufacturer McDonnell Douglas
Corp. is defending itself against a $6 million lawsuit filed by
Lloyd's of London, alleging negligence for damage to a satellite.
   The case stems from a June 20, 1989, accident at a Cape
Canaveral launch pad in which a 65-pound crane hook crashed into an
$80 million communications satellite on a Delta rocket.
   The satellite was insured by Lloyd's, and the manufacturer
repaired it at an estimated cost of $10 million. The insurance
group wants to recover part og the costs.
   The suit alleges that McDonnell and employees of its space
operations unit ``negligently and carelessly planned, simulated,
trained for and conducted the handling and removal procedure'' in a
way that caused the crane cable to snap while loading the satellite.
   It accuses McDonnell employees of ``reckless, wanton and gross
negligence'' in violating statutes and industry standards for
operation of an overhead crane.
   The suit was filed last month in Brevard County Circuit Court,
and McDonnell has petitioned for its transfer to federal court
because the accident occurred on U.S. government property.
   The case is the second in the commercial space launch industry
in a month.
   Martin Marietta Corp. and the International Telecommunications
Satellite Oraganization went to court earlier this month to decide
who should pay for a satellite launch failure in March.
   A Martin Marietta-built Titan 4 rocket failed to boost the $157
million Intelsat satellite into the proper orbit.

   Earnings for Martin Marietta Corp., a
leading aerospace and defense contractor, increased in the second
quarter due to the success of several space programs, the company
said Tuesday.
   Second-quarter net income was $94.5 million, or $1.85 per share,
compared to $86.9 million, or $1.64 per share during the same
quarter last year.
   Sales for the second quarter increased from $1.4 billion to $1.7
billion, the Bethesda-based company said.
   Norman R. Augustine, chairman and chief executive officer, said
several major programs, including the Titan IV space launch system
and LANTIRN night vision and targeting system, led the way with
sales increases.
   ``The advance in second-quarter net income moves us a step
closer to achieving our 1990 objective _ maintaining our upward
trend of earnings per share,'' Augustine said.
   Net earnings for the first half of 1990 were $161.6 million or
$3.17 per share, compared to $146.1 million or $2.76 for the first
half of last year. Net sales were $3.1 billion, up from $2.7
billion in the 1989 period.

   The stock market was mixed this afternoon after
the blue chips rebounded from a bout of midday selling.
   A rally in oil stocks tied to speculation about prospects for
higher petroleum prices helped lift the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   The blue chip measure see-sawed between minor gains and losses
all morning until futures-related sell programs pushed the average
to a double-digit decline in early afternoon. But by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street, the average had reversed course and sported a gain of 5.45,
rising to 2,910.15.
   But in the broader market, declining issues outpaced advances by
about 6 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 816 up, 678 down
and 472 unchanged.
   Trading volume slowed slightly from Monday's brisk pace. Volume
on the Big Board came to 153.48 million shares with one hour left
to go.
   The NYSE's index of all its listed issues shed 0.22 to 194.00.
At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index edged 0.03
higher to 354.95.
   Oil stocks were the star performers. Analysts said a meeting
this week of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
could pave the way for higher oil prices.
   Exxon added 1~ to 49} in heavy trading of more than 1.9 million
shares. Amoco advanced 1| to 55, Chevron rose 1\ to 78&lsqb;, Mobil
moved 1| higher to 66| and Texaco jumped 2\ to 62.
   Market watchers had expected continued volatility today with
traders reacting to fresh news from the corporate front.
   Disappointing corporate earnings reports released recently set a
negative tone in the market Monday and acted as one of the
catalysts causing the setback that drove the Dow industrial average
down more than 100 points Monday morning.
   The average managed to regain about half of its early loss. By
the close Monday, the oldest and best known measure of trends in
stock prices, stood at 2,904.70, down 56.44 points from last week's
close.
   Concerns that inflationary pressures may be building at a time
of economic weakness contributed to the bearish outlook on Wall
Street. Computer-aided program trading also played a part in the
selloff and added to the volatility.
   The parade of poor earnings reports continued today as Dow
Chemical posted a 50 percent plunge in its second-quarter profit.
The stock tumbled 5| to 52{ and led the Big Board's list of active
issues on turnover of more than 3 million shares.
   Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, slid 2{ to
47&rsqb;. The Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a major student
loan guarantor in financial trouble, ended merger talks with
another guarantor. Sallie Mae is among the foundation's largest
creditors.

<HEAD>By The Associated Press</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A drop in crude oil prices worked to depress earnings at Texaco
Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. during the second quarter, but
Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. managed to improve results during the
period, the companies reported Tuesday.
   Though relatively strong during the year's first quarter, crude
oil prices fell an average of $4 a barrel in the subsequent quarter
because of worldwide oversupply. As a result, Texaco's profits
during the period slipped 4 percent, while Phillips reported a 47
percent tumble in net income.
   Several other major oil companies have reported lower earnings
due to lower crude prices, including Atlantic Richfield Co., Amoco,
and Amerada Hess Corp.
   But Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil concern, reported a
24 percent jump in net income, largely due to special factors, and
profits at Chevron were up a sharp 60 percent.

<TEXT>
   Mobil estimated net income for the second quarter at $498
million, or $1.19 a share, up from $401 million, or 98 cents a
share a year earlier. The 1990 quarter got a $182 million boost
from the sale of a 5 percent stake in a North Sea oil field and the
sale of Mobil's refining and fuels marketing business in Italy.
   Revenue for the period was $13.8 billion, off 1 percent from $14
billion in the year-ago period.
   Mobil Chairman Allen E. Murray said excluding special items,
petroleum operations were slightly lower than a year earlier, and
stronger refining margins did not offset sharply lower crude oil
prices. The company's chemical operations also reported lower
results.
   For the first half, Mobil estimated net earnings at $898
million, or $2.13 a share, up 8 percent from $830 million, or $2.02
a share in the first half of 1989. Excluding special items,
first-half earnings of $856 million were down $114 million from the
year-ago level.
   Revenue for the period increased 3 percent to $28.9 billion,
from $28.1 billion in the first half of 1989.

   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, said net income
during the quarter totaled $353 million, or $1.26 a share, down
from $366 million, or $1.39 a share a year ago.
   Revenue rose 3 percent to $8.72 billion, from $8.45 billion a
year ago largely because of higher crude and oil product sales
volumes.
   In addition to lower crude prices during the second quarter,
natural gas prices also fell and petrochemical results were
``significantly lower ... because of oversupply and reduced
demand,'' Texaco Chief Executive and President James W. Kinnear
said in a statement from the company's White Plains, N.Y.,
headquarters.
   For the year's first half, Texaco reported net income of $681
million, or $2.41 a share, down 63 percent from $1.82 billion, or
$7.19 a share in the year-ago period, which included a $1.19
billion gain from the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. Without the gain,
net income was up 8 percent, the company said.

   For the year's first half, the nation's fourth-largest oil
company said net income totaled $1.12 billion, or $3.16 a share, up
56 percent from $717 million, or $2.09 a share in the 1989 first

Houston chemical complex, which was shut down after an accident in
October 1989 and remains closed.
   Revenue declined 9 percent to $2.98 billion, from $3.3 billion a

   Times Mirror Co. said Tuesday its earnings dropped 44.7 percent
from results a year ago that included a gain on a timberlands sale,
while Tribune Co. said its profit tumbled 25 percent in the second
quarter.
   Another major media company, Knight-Ridder Inc., said its net
income skidded 64.8 percent for the second quarter from results
last year that were inflated by gains on the sale of a newspaper
and television stations.
   Washington Post Co. said its earnings for the quarter fell 7.5

   The publisher of the Los Angeles Times and six other newspapers
said it earned $47.0 million, or 36 cents a share, in the second
quarter compared with $85.0 million, or 66 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 5.3 percent to $906.6 million from
$861.3 million.
   The 1989 results included a gain of 11 cents a share on the sale
of timberlands.
   Robert F. Erburu, chairman and chief executive, said weak
economic conditions continued adversely affecting the company's
newspaper and other advertising-driven businesses. Times Mirror
also owns four TV stations, a professional book company, cable TV
systems and consumer magazines.
   For the first half, the company earned $93.0 million, or 72

   Revenue for the first half rose to $1.78 billion from $1.71

   Chicago-based Tribune said its profit decline was due mainly to
operating losses at the New York Daily News and a decline in
newsprint operating profit.
   The company said it earned $58.1 million, or 78 cents a share,
in the three months ended June 30 compared with $75.3 million, or
98 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 2 percent to $656.2 million from
$643.1 million a year earlier.
   The company said its operating profit from newspaper publishing
fell 33 percent, mainly due to losses at the Daily News that
reflected economic weakness in the New York area and costs of
contract negotiations with the paper's labor unions.
   Results from the Chicago Tribune improved, but results from its
other papers were flat or lower because of softness in retail and
classified advertising, the company said.
   Operating profit from the newsprint group fell 83 percent to
$3.1 million because of lower newsprint selling prices and the
adverse impact of a stronger Canadian dollar.
   For the first half, Tribune earned $89.6 million, or $1.21 a

   But the 1989 results were inflated by $1.67 a share due to gains
on the sale of the Pasadena Star-News and television operations.
   Otherwise, Knight-Ridder said its net income rose 14.3 percent
when compared with last year's earnings from ongoing operations.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 2.2 percent to $591.7 million from

<HEAD>Weyerhaeuser Earnings Drop 26 percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Second-quarter declines of 26 percent in
profits and 10 percent in sales were reported Tuesday by the
Weyerhaeuser Co., with the pulp and paper markets blamed for most
of the slump.
   A statement issued by the forest products corporation said net
earnings for the 13 weeks ending July 1 amounted to $114.3 million
or 54 cents a share on $2.4 billion in net sales, down from $154.9
million or 73 cents a share on $2.6 billion in sales for the
year-earlier period.
   Sales for the first six months of fiscal 1990 were $4.7 billion,
down 6 percent from 1989's first-half sales of $5 billion, while
net earnings fell from $302.9 million or $1.43 a share to $244.3
million or $1.15 a share, a 19 percent decline.
   Company chairman George H. Weyerhaeuser said the biggest factor
in the second-quarter drop was a 40 percent decline in earnings on
pulp and paper products over the past year.
   The pulp division was hit by maintenance work that cut
production at a time of soft markets, and prices were weak in the
paper division until a recent upward turn, Weuerhaeuser said.
   Forest products results were flat as a decline in export volumes
and lower prices for Western products were offset by stronger sales
of southern lumber and plywood and better results for engineered
fiber panels.
   Real estate earnings slumped, largely because of weak markets in
Baltimore, Southern California and Florida, while a reorganization
of financial services brought gains in mortgage and insurance
subsidiaries, the statement said.
   A corporate structural review will be completed in the third
quarter, with reorganization and improvement plans for lumber and
plywood to begin taking effect in September, Weyerhaeuser said.

   Crude oil futures prices continued their rally,
finishing modestly higher Tuesday after profit-taking brought
contracts down from their highest levels.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 6 cents to settle at $20.56 a
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Other
contract months also gained ground.
   The near-month contract rose 44 cents on Monday to its highest
level since April.
   Crude prices opened on a firm note following reports that Iraq
was amassing troups on the Kuwait border and threatening military
action.
   But prices held to a ``fairly narrow range'' before losing some
ground on the day on profit taking, said Andrew Lebow, an analyst
at E.D.&amp;F. Man International Inc.
   Also supporting prices was a report that Iraqi Oil Minister
Issam al-Chalabi will insist on a $25-a-barrel price for crude at
the OPEC meeting Thursday. Ministers from the 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are scheduled to
gather in Geneva, Switzerland.
   Iran, Iraq's foe in the eight-year Gulf war, has said it
supports a $20-a-barrel price, up from the current benchmark of $18
a barrel.
   Traders are anticipating OPEC will approve a production ceiling
of 22.5 million barrels a day. The current ceiling is 22.09 million
barrels, but members consistenly have been pumping more than 23
million barrels daily.
   Prices for refined products traded on the Merc were mixed.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for August delivery, which rose 0.39
cent on Monday, settled off 0.07 cent at 63.28 cents a gallon, but
later contract months gained ground.
   The August contract for home heating oil, which rose 0.71 cent
on Monday, was up 0.82 cent to close at 57.32 cents a gallon, with
subsequent months also settling higher.
   In natural gas trading, the September contract settled at $1.450

   The stock market steadied today after Monday's
rout and blue chips got a lift from a rally in oil issues.
   Speculation that a meeting this week of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries could pave the way for higher oil
prices encouraged investors to favor oil and oilfield service
stocks.
   Other stocks benefitted from selective bargain hunting as
investors sifted through the wreckage of the selloff on Monday.
   Market watchers attributed part of today's volatility to traders
reacting to fresh news from the corporate front.
   Disappointing corporate earnings reports released in recent days

   The average managed to regain about half of its early loss. By

   Concerns that inflationary pressures may be building at a time

<TEXT>
   The dollar weakened Tuesday against key foreign
currencies in worldwide trading.
   Gold prices ended lower after rising overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $367.90 a troy ounce, off $1.20 from late
Monday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $367.25 an ounce, down 90 cents.
   Currency dealers said continued concerns about interest rates
helped push the dollar lower.
   However, technical factors, along with news of an Iraqi troop
buildup along the Kuwaiti border, helped temper its fall, they said.
   The dollar is often seen as a safe haven in times of political
turmoil, such as the Iraqi military action.
   The markets were paying particular attention Tuesday to Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the House
Banking subcommittee.
   Greenspan said a ``credible and enforceable'' budget deficit
agreement could bring about lower interest rates in the financial
markets. But he warned the Fed wouldn't move to accelerate a drop
in rates unless it was assured inflation was under control.
   Lower interest rates tend to bring down the value of a currency.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar rose
to a closing 148.70 Japanese yen from 148.50 yen Monday. It traded
at 148.35 yen in London, and at 148.40 yen in New York, up from
148.19 yen.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared to
Monday. Sterling rose to $1.8250 from $1.8215 in London, and fell
to $1.8140 from $1.8255 in New York.

<HEAD>Fed Governor Seger Reportedly Mulling Resignation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may get a third chance to
appoint a member of the Federal Reserve Board if Martha Seger
resigns.
   Seger, 58, a governor on the seven-member board since 1984, said
in an interview published in Tuesday's editions of The Wall Street
Journal that she may resign to care for her elderly mother, who
lives in Arizona and recently underwent hip surgery and suffered a
stroke.
   Seger, who has eight years remaining in her 14-year term, is the
board's most outspoken advocate of an easy money policy to keep
economic growth vigorous. She frequently is at odds with other
board members who favor higher interest rates to slow the economy
and reduce inflation.
   ``I'll probably make a decision by the end of this year on
whether or not I have to leave,'' she told the newspaper. ``I'm
going to play it by ear.''
   Seger did not return several telephone messages seeking comment.
   Bush already has appointed David Mullins, a former assistant
secretary of the Treasury, to fill one vacancy on the board. He is
due to select a successor to Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, who
has announced he plans to resign next month.
   In recent months, Bush and his cabinet members have clashed with
the Fed over the central bank's monetary policy. The administration
wants lower rates to keep growth strong through the fall
congressional elections and offset any negative economic effects
from a budget deal calling for higher taxes and spending cuts.
   On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House
subcommittee that the central bank has not abandoned its battle
against inflation as part of any deficit-cutting deal.
   Greenspan said the Fed remained intent on achieving ``within a
few years'' its goal of pushing inflationary pressures close to
zero.

<HEAD>Conglomerate Reports Big Gain, Largely on Sale of Alcatel Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp., one of the world's largest
conglomerates, reported a 63 percent jump in second-quarter
earnings Tuesday, largely due to a one-time gain from selling a
stake in a leading telecommunications company.
   The New York-based company, with global operations ranging from
insurance to defense gear to Sheraton hotels, said it earned $397
million or $3 a share in the three months that ended June 30, vs.
$244 million or $1.70 a share in the comparable period a year
earlier.
   Revenue totaled $5.2 billion, unchanged from a year earlier. The
company attributed the lack of growth to divestures in 1989 as well
as flat revenues by its insurance and automotive-components
businesses.
   ITT said the second-quarter earnings were enlarged from the sale
of a 7 percent stake of Alcatel NV of France to Compagnie Generale
d'Electricite in June, which resulted in an after-tax gain of $139
million.
   ITT retains a 30 percent interest in Alcatel, one of the biggest
telecommunications equipment concerns.
   The 1989 second-quarter earnings figures included a $18 million
gain on the sale of ITT's European headquarters, as well as a $28
million decline to reflect the cost of ITT's investment in Thompson
McKinnon Inc., a failed Wall Street investment firm.
   Excluding these extraordinary items and the Alcatel gain,
second-quarter earnings were only marginally higher.
   Still, the results were better than expected, considering the
weakness in some of ITT's most important businesses: insurance,
defense and hotels. The company's stock price rose 62.5 cents a
share to $57.37{ Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ITT said earnings fell at its defense, electronic components,
financial and hotel units but remained sound or strengthened in the
automotive, fluid technology and pulp-timber businesses. ITT's
insurance business also improved from higher investment income and
life insurance operations, which offset weakness in casualty
underwriting, the company said.
   For the first half of the year, earnings totaled $650 million or
$4.88 a share, a 46 percent increase over the $444 million or $3.10
a share earned in the first half of 1989. Revenues totaled $10.2
billion vs. $10 billion, a 2 percent gain.

<HEAD>Strength in Oil Stocks Lifts Dow Industrials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market steadied Tuesday with the help
of a rally in oil issues ignited by speculation about higher
petroleum prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended with a gain of
17.82 points at 2,922.52. Most of the increase reflected movements
in the blue chip oil stocks Chevron, Exxon and Texaco.
   The blue chip average had see-sawed between minor gains and
losses all morning until futures-related sell programs pushed it to
a double-digit decline in early afternoon. Renewed buying _
particularly in the oil patch _ sparked a recovery.
   Advancing and declining issues ended almost even in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 753 up, 755
down and 509 unchanged.
   Trading activity slowed slightly from Monday's brisk pace.
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 181.92 million shares,
down from 209.03 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 216.73 million shares.
   Oil stocks were the star performers. Analysts said a meeting
this week of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
could pave the way for higher oil prices. OPEC ministers began
gathering in Geneva, Switzerland, Tuesday to plot strategy to cope
with a world oil glut.
   Exxon soared 2&lsqb; to 50 in heavy trading of more than 2.4 million
shares. Chevron climbed 1~ to a 52-week high of 78} and Texaco
jumped 2} to a 52-week high of 62{. Elsewhere in the oil patch,
Amoco advanced 1{ to 54~, Atlantic Richfield added 1&lsqb; to 125{,
Mobil moved 2 higher to a 52-week high of 67 and Kerr McGee gained
1&rsqb; to 49.
   Stocks of companies serving the oil industry also benefitted
from the buying spree. Baker Hughes rose | to 29|, Haliburton
surged 2&rsqb; to 53| and Schlumberger rose 1&rsqb; to 64~. All three set new
52-week highs.
   Market watchers attributed Tuesday's generally erratic trading
pattern to nervousness after Monday's steep slide. The volatility
also reflected traders reacting to fresh news from the corporate
front.
   Disappointing corporate earnings reports released in recent days
had depressed market sentiment Monday, which touched off a setback
that temporarily drove the Dow industrial average down more than
100 points.
   The average managed to regain about half of its early loss. By
the close Monday, the oldest and best known measure of trends in
stock prices, stood at 2,904.70, down 56.44 points from last week's
close.
   Concerns that inflationary pressures may be building at a time
of economic weakness contributed to the bearish outlook on Wall
Street.
   The parade of poor earnings reports continued Tuesday as Dow
Chemical posted a 50 percent plunge in its second-quarter profit.
The stock tumbled 5} to 52&rsqb; and led the Big Board's list of active
issues on turnover of more than 3.44 million shares.
   The Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae, ended
down 1} at 48&lsqb;. The stock has suffered in the wake of news that the
Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a major student loan
guarantor, is in financial trouble. Sallie Mae is among the
foundation's largest creditors.
   One of the day's biggest losers was Reuters Holdings, which is
traded in the over-the-counter market. Reuters' American Depository
Shares tumbled 10 to 56\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market edged up $805 million, or 0.02
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.23 to 194.45.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index increased 0.91 to 421.70, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index finished at 355.79, up 0.48.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.08 to 442.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 355.51, 0.59 higher.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Tumble On Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices resumed their slide Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as many traders who had cashed out of the
market in the previous session became sellers again amid forecasts
for good growing weather.
   Most corn futures also retreated while wheat futures advanced on
expectations for new export sales of the grain.
   On other commodity markets, crude oil futures rose; livestock
and meat futures were mostly higher; and precious metals fell.
   Soybean futures settled 8{ cents lower to 2 cents higher in
Chicago with the contract for delivery in August at $5.84\ a bushel.
   Wheat finished 1 cent to 1} cents higher with September at
$3.03{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents lower to 3{ cents higher with
September at $2.61{ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents higher
with September at $1.28\ a bushel.
   Bullish chart signals in the soybean market were eclipsed by a
National Weather Service forecast that predicted normal
temperatures and above-normal rainfall in the Midwest during the
first half of next week.
   The outlook for a continuation of near-perfect growing
conditions brought back into the market traders who had evened up
their books Monday, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``The weather remains the main bearish influence,'' he said.
``The bias was generally toward the downside and that's the way we
ended.''
   Selling interest was tempered, though, by concerns about the
slow pace at which the soybean and corn crops are developing, a
function of heavy spring rains that delayed planting.
   A weekly Agriculture Department report released late Monday
showed only 28 percent of the corn crop at the silking stage as of
Sunday compared with the average of 62 percent for that date.
   The USDA said 36 percent of the soybean crop was blooming
compared with a 57 percent norm, and 6 percent of soybeans were
setting pods compared with the average of 20 percent.
   Lespinasse said fears are filtering into the market that an
early frost could damage late-maturing crops, reducing the overall
yields.
   Crude oil futures extended their gains on the New York
Mercantile Exchange following reports that Iraq was amassing troups
on the Kuwait border and threatening military action.
   Further support stemmed from a report that Iraqi Oil Minister
Issam al-Chalabi will insist on a $25-a-barrel price for crude at
the OPEC meeting Thursday in Geneva.
   After the close the American Petroleum Institute released its
weekly stocks report, which showed U.S. supply levels of crude and
refined products to be in line with expectations.
   Crude oil stocks declined 1.6 million barrels, gasoline stocks
rose 672,000 barrels and supplies of petroleum distillates rose 2.4
million barrels, the API reported.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 2 cents lower to 14
cents higher with September at $20.56 a barrel; heating oil was .39
cent to .82 cent higher with August at 57.32 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .14 cent lower to .60 cent higher with August
at 63.28 cents a gallon.
   Pork belly futures staged a dramatic turnaround on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, rising the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a
pound after posting limit losses in three of the four previous
sessions.
   Analysts attributed much of the buying to strength in the cash
belly market, which boosted prices of fresh pork bellies over
frozen bellies for the first time in several days.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent to .73 cent higher with August at
76.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to 1.07 cents
higher with August at 88.37 cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent
lower to .42 cent higher with August at 59.37 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 2 cents higher across the board with August at
45.12 cents a pound.
   Precious metals retreated on New York's Commodity Exchange with
silver down substantially on indications of abundant supplies and
slack demand.
   Gold futures settled $1.10 to $1.30 lower with August $368.40 a
troy ounce; silver was 7.1 cents to 7.5 cents lower with July at
$4.811 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Political Tension High As OPEC Ministers Gather for Critical Oil
Talks</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 19th graf, The September... to UPDATE with closing crude
price.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers Tuesday began gathering for a
critical strategy session that has been overshadowed by Iraqi
threats to punish cartel members that exceed their oil production
limits.
   The meeting is taking place as oil prices continue a rebound
from lows of earlier this year that served to aggravate the
political tensions raised by Iraq, especially against neighboring
cartel member Kuwait.
   A number of ministers expressed support for increasing the
cartel's benchmark price for its crude from the current $18 a
barrel, which would require agreement on new production limits.
   But ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries sidestepped the confrontation between Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``We are here to solve oil problems,'' said Saudi Arabia's
influential oil minister, Hisham Nazer, as he arrived for the
mid-year meeting scheduled for Thursday.
   Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, was
surrounded by dozens of reporters as he entered the lobby of a
luxury hotel where the talks are held. He only discussed his plans
to press for an increase in the current $18 a barrel benchmark
price for the cartel's crude oil.
   The cartel's discussions have taken on added significance since
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week threatened to use force
against countries that exceed their OPEC-set production quotas.
   His remarks were aimed at Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
two Gulf producers that have violated their output ceilings.
   Saddam claimed his debt-ridden country has lost $14 billion
during the past year because of a world oil glut that sent crude
prices tumbling. Iraq also has charged that Kuwait stole $2.4
billion worth of Iraqi oil since 1980 from wells it dug on Iraqi
territory across their common border.
   Iraq reportedly has moved 30,000 troops to its border with
Kuwait, and battlefield missiles, armored personnel carriers and
tanks were displayed prominently along the road from Iraq to Kuwait.
   The United States on Tuesday expressed concern with the buildup
and confirmed its naval forces were holding a joint exercise in the
Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates.
   The Iraqi threats were made a week after Saudi Arabia and four
other Gulf producers proposed an accord designed to halt the
runaway production of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   Nazer told reporters he was confident OPEC would reach an
agreement along the lines of the Gulf proposal. That plan would
limit the cartel's production to about 22.5 million barrels a day
in the next few months.
   The cartel's cap for the first half of the year was 22.1 million
barrels. However, a confidential report prepared by OPEC's
secretariat in Vienna put actual production at 23.5 million barrels
a day in the April-June quarter, according to sources familiar with
the document.
   Demand for the cartel's oil was estimated at 21.8 million
barrels a day in the third quarter of this year, rising to 24.4
million barrels in the last three months of the year, said the
sources, who demanded anonymity.
   The OPEC market report said an overall production ceiling of 22
million barrels a day in the second half of the year would improve
prices considerably.
   OPEC's excess production sent prices tumbling in the spring.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by the
cartel plummeted to $13.64 a barrel in June before climbing to
$16.25 a barrel last week.
   The September contract for the benchmark U.S. crude finished at
$20.56 a barrel late Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
up 6 cents from Monday and up about $5 from its lows in June.
   Iran has proposed a reference price of $20 a barrel while Iraq
wants a $25 level. Nazer said Saudi Arabia supported a price hike,
but he did not mention a figure.
   Iraq's Chalabi said his country was aiming for $25 and Gabon's
Jean Ping said he would like to see the target raised above $18.
   Under the Gulf proposal, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
each would limit output to 1.5 million barrels a day. The two
separately have been pumping as much as 2 million barrels a day.
   Kuwait's current production cap is 1.5 million barrels a day,
and the U.A.E. quota is 1.1 million barrels.
   While the cartel's official summer meeting opens Thursday, its
eight-member monitoring panel will hold talks Wednesday.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   McDonald's Corp. and Wendy's International announced Monday they
are switching to cholesterol-free, all-vegetable oil to cook their
french fries.
   In April, anti-cholesterol crusader Phil Sokolof placed ads in
newspapers criticizing McDonald's and other restaurants for cooking
fries in beef tallow rather than using ``heart-healthy oils.''
   Here is a brief explanation of fats:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>BASICS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   All dietary fats are mixtures of three kinds of fatty acids:
saturated, mono-saturated, and polyunsaturated.
   According to some studies, the relative health merits of
different oils and fats are determined by the proportions of each
of the three different kinds of fatty acids in the individual oil
or fat.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SATURATED FATTY ACIDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fats with a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids are
generally solid at room temperature. Research indicates they
increase blood cholesterol.
   ANIMAL FATS have a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids
than most fats from plants. Animal fats also contain cholesterol.
   TROPICAL OILS are derived from plants, and therefore contain no
cholesterol. However, they are high in saturated fatty acids. Some
tropical oils such as palm oil, coconut oil and palm kernel oil
actually have more saturated fatty acids than the animal fats.
   HYDROGENATED FATS are other fats of plant origin that have been
processed, or hydrogenated, and have become saturated fats. The
degree of saturation is dependent on the processing, but generally
the harder the product is at room temperature, the more saturated
it is. Examples of hydrogenated products are hard shortenings, hard
or stick margarines, and some kinds of peanut butter.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MONO-SATURATED FATTY ACIDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fats with a high proportion of monosaturated fatty acids do not
increase blood cholesterol. Studies suggest the monosaturates,
particularly olive oil, actually reduce blood cholesterol levels.
Monosaturated fats include olive oil, peanut oil and avocado oil.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Fats with a high proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids are
found primarily in plants and in some kinds of fish.
Polyunsaturates reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering
cholesterol levels in the blood. Polyunsaturates include sunflower
oil, corn oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil and some
fish oils.

   Administration officials said Tuesday they had
scrapped the idea of turning over the troubled portfolio of the
nation's largest guarantor of college student loans to a much
smaller Nebraska program.
   The officials said the Department of Education is exploring
other options, including the possibility of finding another agency
to take over the strained Higher Education Assistance Foundation.
The foundation informed the government it is having serious
problems meeting its obligations to insure nearly $300 million in
defaulted student loans for fiscal year 1990.
   The foundation's troubles have raised doubts that it can ensure
the availability of new loans, service its outstanding debt and pay
on default claims.
   ``We're looking at a range of alternatives whereby another
entity or entities insure all of those functions either on a
short-or long-term basis,'' said Education Undersecretary Ted
Stevens.
   ``Under the scenario that I'm talking about here, HEAF would not
exist,'' he added during a press briefing.
   ``We're trying to get to a point of a friendly takeover by a
stronger guarantor,'' said an official from the Office of
Management and Budget who requested anonymity.
   In a written statement, HEAF said it was ``pursuing on its own
additional options that would enable us to restore confidence'' to
its loan guarantees as the peak activity season begins.
   However, the foundation said, ``It is best that we not speculate
on how these problems might be resolved or who might be involved.''
   The OMB official identified the United Students Aids Funds in
Indianapolis, Ind., as one possible candidate to take over HEAF.
   But a proposed merger agreement that would have transferred many
of HEAF's loan default obligations to the Nebraska Student Loan
Program Inc. apparently has been abandoned.
   The department determined that the Nebraska program would have
been unable to manage a portfolio the size of HEAF's. It also said
such a merger would offer only a short-term remedy and might have
circumvented the law.
   HEAF was the nation's largest guarantor of student loans last
year with $9.6 billion in loans outstanding. The outstanding loan
program of the Nebraska program is just under $500 million.
   Under the merger agreement, the federal government would have
footed the bill for HEAF's fiscal year 1990 default obligations and
the foundation would have been allowed to start anew on Oct. 1, the
beginning of the 1991 fiscal year.
   Through the government's Guaranteed Student Loan program, 55
guarantors, including HEAF, insure 100 percent of student loans to
banks or secondary lenders.
   The education department reinsures the loans and reimburses the
guarantor agency for payments to lenders. The reimbursement rates
begin at 100 percent but drop to 90 percent when re-insurance
payments exceed five percent. When the payments reach 9 percent the
rate falls to 80 percent.
   HEAF is the only guarantor to reach the 9 percent level,
dropping the government's repayment rate to 80 percent in April.
   HEAF has guaranteed billions in trade school loans with high
default rates. Such loans accounted for 59 percent of HEAF's 1988
portfolio but only 35 percent in 1989.
   Officials also sought to assure students, lenders and other
agencies that HEAF's problems do not signal system-wide problems
for the student loan program.
   ``This situation will not affect the ability of students to
obtain loans, of lenders to make those loans or of guarantors to
insure those loans,'' Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said.
   Officials said HEAF's problems are serious but are isolated to
that organization.
   However, education officials said the government is not
obligated to pay lenders in event of insurance defaults by HEAF or
other guarantors in the event of student loan defaults.
   The OMB official dismissed temptations to compare problems in
the student loan program with the multi-billion dollar savings and
loan crisis.
   ``This is not a big federal bailout. ... This is not a federal
bailout, period,'' he said. ``The numbers are big but it is not an
S&amp;L-type situation.''
   A nine-member education department review team and two
high-ranking OMB officials were sent Monday to HEAF offices in St.
Paul, Minn.

<HEAD>Honeywell Announces Spinoff of Defense and Marines Systems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. announced details Tuesday of
plans to spin off its defense and marine systems business into a
new company to be called Alliant Techsystems Inc.
   After the spinoff is completed, Alliant Techsystems would be the
17th-largest direct supplier to the Defense Department, and would
rank about 300th on the Fortune 500 list, Honeywell said.
   The company said Alliant Techsystems would be the eighth-largest
publicly held industrial corporation in Minnesota.
   Honeywell said it expects to obtain final board approval of the
spinoff in the fall.
   According to preliminary plans, people who own Honeywell stock
on the record date for the distribution would receive one share of
Alliant Techsystems' common stock for every four shares of
Honeywell.
   Based on 38.2 million shares of Honeywell stock currently
outstanding, about 9.5 million shares of Alliant Techsystems' stock
would be distributed to Honeywell shareholders.
   Application will be made to list Alliant Techsystems' common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange. It would trade separately
from Honeywell Inc. common stock.
   Alliant Techsystems' management team will be led by Toby G.
Warson, president and chief executive officer, who was formerly
chief executive officer of Honeywell's United Kingdom subsidiary.
   Alliant Techsystems' defense and marine systems and test
instruments businesses provide products and services to the U.S.
government, allied governments and other customers.
   Products include tactical munitions, torpedos, electronics
systems, sonar and signal processing subsystems, undersea vehicles,
information storage and testing and certification services and
products for the information security and intelligence market.
   James J. Renier, Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer,
said the spinoff will give shareholders an opportunity to hold
ownership in a new defense company, while Honeywell focuses
exclusively on its core controls businesses.
   Honeywell is a global controls company that provides products,
systems and services for homes and buildings, industry, and
aviation and space. The company had 1989 sales of $6.1 billion.

<HEAD>Confirmation Hearing Begins on Resorts Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc. took its plan for
reorganization to bankruptcy court Tuesday where an official of the
casino company said the restructuring will secure recovery.
   ``From my point of view, the company has bottomed out and is on
the way back,'' Christopher Whitney, a resorts vice president
testified. ``The company is ahead of its plan.''
   The hearing is expected to continue for several days.
   The reorganization plan was overwhelmingly approved by
bondholders Monday, but is being opposed by several dissident
investors and Donald Trump, who swapped Resorts to Merv Griffin for
the newly opened Taj Mahal Casino Resort next door.
   Trump's attorneys are in the courtroom because of a provision in
the restucturing plan to set aside $5 million to pursue a possible
suit against him. A suit would force Trump to answer claims he left
Resorts financially insolvent.
   Under the restructuring, bondholders would get 78 percent of the
company, leaving Griffin with 22 percent.
   The plan needs the approval of U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge
Rosemary Gambardella, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, as
well as the government of the Bahamas. The plan calls for the sale
of Resort's Paradise Island operations there.
   Resorts has been dissappointed by the lack of spillover since
the April 2 opening of the Taj Mahal. The casino continues its
slide of declining gross gaming revenue, or ``win'' when compared
to the same time period the year before.

<HEAD>Johnson &amp; Johnson Reports Second Quarter Earnings Up 19 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Johnson &amp; Johnson said Tuesday its
second-quarter earnings increased almost 19 percent on strong
showings in its pharmaceutical and professional health care lines.
   Pharmaceutical sales for the quarter were up 26 percent
worldwide, and professional sales, which include surgical
instruments and diagnostic products, rose 20.8 percent from last
year's second quarter.
   For the second three months of the year, profits totaled $353
million, or $1.06 per share, on revenue of $2.82 billion. That
compared with earnings of $297 million, or 89 cents a share, on
revenue of $2.39 billion in the same period last year.
   Profits for the first six months of 1990 fell 2.8 percent to
$597 million, or $1.79 per share, from $614 million, or $1.84 a
share for the first half of 1989. Sales rose to $5.66 billion from
$4.8 billion.
   Earnings dropped in that period primarily because of one-time
first-quarter losses sustained in shutting down Johnson &amp; Johnson
of Argentina, said company spokesman F. Robert Kniffen.
   The Argentina division produced consumer and professional
products, Kniffen said.
   Ralph S. Larsen, chairman and chief executive officer, said
Ortho Diagnostics, which introduced a test for hepatitis C in the
United States in the quarter, more than doubled its sales worldwide
during the second quarter, compared to the same period last year.

<HEAD>Zenith Reports Second-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Electronics Corp. Tuesday reported
a loss of $11.2 million for the second quarter of the year as sales
fell and expenditures to develop high-definition television
increased.
   The loss, which came on sales of $334.1 million, translates to
42 cents per share. For the same period last year, the loss from
continuing operations was $5.2 million, or 20 cents a share, on
sales of $385 million.
   The company said the $3 million spent toward HDTV development
was a substantial increase over the expenditure in the same period
last year.
   Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith president and chairman, said in March
the $24 million research and development project on HDTV would
affect earnings for the next few years. The project is a
partnership with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   For the first six months of 1990, Zenith reported a net loss
from continuing operations of $15.2 million, or 57 cents a share.
During the first half of 1989, losses from continuing operations
were $11.9 million, or 45 cents a share.
   Conintuing operations do not include the company's computer
business, which was sold Dec. 28. Zenith computer operations lost
$11 million in the first half of 1990.
