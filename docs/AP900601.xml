   A tornado churned across a Texas highway Friday night, causing
accidents that killed at least two people and damaging nearby homes,
authorities said.
   At least 19 people were reported injured when the twister struck
along Farm Road 305 outside the West Texas town of Iraan, said state
Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox.
   ``Apparently it struck cars on the highway and well as ranch
houses and possibly some oilfield-related structures in the area,''
Cox said.
   Two people were killed, in car accidents caused by the twister,
he said. There were five car accidents on 305 and four accidents on
another highway, he said.
   The injured included two state troopers cut by flying glass when
hail and high winds accompanying the tornado blew out the windows of
their patrol car on the road 230 miles northwest of San Antonio,
   Many of the injured were motorists, said Bonnie Burton, director
of nurses at McCamey County Hospital. ``But not all of them were in
cars,'' she said. ``We had one family whose whole house fell in on
them.''
   The twister also blew down an old gymnasium and damaged the
McCamey Water Supply, which warned the city's 2,400 residents to
conserve water for the next couple of days, said City Secretary
Stanley Bryson.
   Several other tornadoes were reported in the area.
   Elsewhere Friday, residents of the Texas Panhandle town of
Spearman cleared wreckage left in the wake of a swarm of funnel
clouds Thursday, and citizens in waterlogged Vicksburg, Miss., swept
out mud left by record flash flooding.
   Damage in Spearman was estimated at $5.5 million. Estimates were
still being collected in Vicksburg.
   About 200 Vicksburg residents were forced to higher ground
Thursday when thunderstorms dumped as much as 7 inches of rain,
overflowing creeks and drainage ditches.
   Water damage was reported to 187 homes and at least two
businesses. Some bridges and roadways in Warren County, on the
Mississippi River, also were damaged, said Civil Defense Chief
Luther Warnock Jr.
   ``We've even had fire trucks out using their hoses to help wash
the mud and debris out of houses before it dries,'' Warnock said.
``I've been been here for 30 years and ... this was the worst
flooding anyone can remember.''
   In Spearman, 10 mobile homes and 10 houses were reported
destroyed. A church also was reported demolished. Some of the mobile
homes were ``smoothed off to the ground,'' said Mayor Burl Buchanan.
   He estimated that 5 percent of the Panhandle town of 3,500 had
property damage. About 80 percent of the city was blacked out and
phone service was spotty until Friday morning.
   There was disagreement over just what caused the damage in
Spearman late Thursday. Residents and witnesses said three funnel
clouds caused the damage even though they didn't quite touch down.
The National Weather Service said one tornado did scour the surface.
   ``There was one that hit Spearman itself, and there were multiple
tornadoes in the vicinity of Spearman for several hours last
night,'' said Steven Cooper of the National Weather Service office
in Amarillo. ``There were about three different storm systems. Two
dropped tornadoes.''
   The funnel clouds were too numerous to count, he said.
   State Trooper Wayne Beighle of Amarillo said 10 twisters were
spotted in the area Thursday night.
   ``We were up there until 1:00 (a.m.), and there were still
tornadoes dancing around. They were all over the place,'' Beighle
said. ``None touched the ground _ they were hovering just above the
ground, but that was enough to do the damage.''
   In Vicksburg, officials declared a state of emergency Friday.
   ``Any time there is this kind of flood, where people are forced
to evacuate their homes, it is a bad situation,'' said Mayor Robert
Walker. ``And this time it was very bad.''
   ``I've been back to my home and everything is turned over and
destroyed,'' Hope Williams said after water drained from her home.
``That was my first year in the subdivision and I hope it was my
last year. I mean water was 6 feet deep in that house.''
   Williams and her six children, ranging from age 2 to 17, spent
the night with other flood victims at an emergency shelter.
   ``The water came up so rapidly that people didn't have time to
get out,'' Police Chief Jimmy Brooks said as he surveyed his own
soaked home. ``We had people in aluminum boats going up and down the
street trying to help others.''

   The Soviets cannot go back to a controlled
economy and cannot go forward to a successful free-market economy
without help from the West, Soviet academicians said Friday at a
meeting with U.S. experts.
   ``The old system is bankrupt,'' said Stanislav Shatalin, head of
the economics division of the Soviet Academy of Science. ``It is
difficult for me to admit that, but it is a fact.''
   The Soviets, he said, still have not decided ``the degree we will
work with the West'' in changing the economy.
   ``Without the help of the West, we cannot establish a successful
market system,'' Shatalin said.
   The comments came at a meeting between 10 Soviet academicians and
a group of U.S. industry, education and government leaders. The
2{-hour session at the National Academy of Sciences centered on a
candid report by the Soviet experts on their nation's efforts to
radically change their economy.
   Shatalin, a member of the President's Council, which advises
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said the Soviets have tried to
shift slowly toward a market economy with measures that included
elements of both a free market and the old centrally controlled
economy.
   The result, he said, has been like ``trying to prop up the
economy with two rocking chairs.''
   Under the measures, Shatalin said, ``the economic situation has
worsened and is getting worse every day.''
   Gorbachev, who appealed on television for the Soviet public to
remain calm as prices increased, does not approve of the entire
reform package, Shatalin said.
   ``The president and the president's council feel quite
differently,'' he said. ``There is a very big difference between
their position and the position of the government.''
   Shatalin said he and other advisers to Gorbachev are looking at
other economic options that could be adopted in the coming months.
   And yet, he said, it's widely recognized that the Soviet Union
can't return to the old centrally controlled economy, which he said
had collapsed.
   ``Even our most reactionary thinkers know it is impossible to
return to the old system'' even though many believe that system
``provided a minimum floor to protect the population'' by providing
assured employment and income, Shatalin said.
   The majority of the population, along with the parliaments and
the local Soviets, ``all agree that there is no longer any
opportunity except to shift to a market system,'' he said.
   ``There is recognition that we have no other path,'' Shatalin
said.
   The Soviet government plans to raise the price of bread later
this year and may organize some form of compensation for people who
would have to pay a larger percentage of their income for bread.
   For low-income workers, Shatalin said, bread represents a major
part of their diet and they will not be able to tolerate a steep
rise in prices without government compensation.
   And yet, he said, ``the question of compensation has been thought
through in a very slipshod fashion.''
   Shatalin said that many in the Soviet Union are confused and
apprehensive about the effects of a free-market economy and that the
expected benefits have not been fully explained.
   Despite that, said academician Georgiy Arbatov, the director of
the Soviet Institute for Studies of the USA and Canada, there is an
``entrepreneurial gift'' among the Soviet people.
   ``We fought against entrepreneurs for two generations,'' he said.
``But was soon as we stopped, they broke out and some are very
gifted.''
   Among the major economic problems that Soviet experts are ``still
thinking through'' according to Shatalin, are:
   _How to raise interest rates on savings. The government pays 3
percent on rubles deposited in savings accounts. Yet, inflation is
about 10 percent. ``We're going to have to raise interest rates on
the order of 12 to 15 percent,'' Shatalin said.
   _How to build a system of selling government bonds to the public
and how to build a stock market for Soviet investors.
   _How to design laws to permit private ownership of land and other
property. ``We need to make changes in all types of ownership,''
Shatalin said. ``Otherwise, we end up in a closed circle.''
   _How to convert the military equipment complexes into factories
producing consumer goods.
   _How to develop a banking system that would provide capital loans
needed by entrepreneurs in a free market.

   Palestinian guerrillas intended to attack the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv when they were intercepted off the Israeli
coast this week, an Israeli official said Friday.
   The high-ranking source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said maps seized from the guerrillas indicated they were headed for
the densely populated beachfront hotel district of Tel Aviv. The
American Embassy is in the district.
   ``During the debriefing we conducted...it was established that
the U.S. Embassy was one of the targets in the vicinity of the hotel
district,'' said the source.
   An army spokesman said he was not authorized to comment on the
report.
   There was no immediate comment from the United States. In
condemning the abortive raid Wednesday, the State Department left
open the possibility the incident could affect U.S. dialogue with
the PLO. That dialogue began after PLO leader Yasser Arafat
denounced terrorism in 1988.
   Israel claims Libya helped mount Wednesday's strike, which was
aimed at crowded Israeli beaches. An Israeli major general, in an
interview with the Yediot Ahronot daily, provided the most detailed
account yet of that alleged involvement.
   Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak said the guerrillas involved in the
seaborne raid trained in a camp set aside for them by Libyan
authorities on the Mediterranean coast.
   ``The investigation shows beyond doubt that Libyan military
personnel were involved in all stages of preparation,'' Shahak said
in the newspaper interview.
   But a Libyan official denied Libyan involvement in the raid.
Gadallah Azouz el-Talhi, Libya's foreign minister, said: ``Some news
media claimed that a Libyan ship carried the speedboats that tried
to go to shore. Libya has no connection at all with the operation,''
el-Talhi said during a visit to Egypt.
   Israeli forces in helicopter gunships and patrol boats foiled the
attempted raid as 16 guerrillas headed for the coast in speedboats.
The Palestine Liberation Front, a faction of the PLO, claimed
responsibility for the attempted attack.
   The day of the incident, Israel's beaches and hotels were crowded
with Israelis celebrating the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
   Locations circled on maps found in the guerrillas' possession
indicated a large Tel Aviv department store as another potential
target in addition to the hotel district, the source said.
   ``Wherever they (guerrillas) can, they try to accomplish a
spectacular mass killing. The U.S. Embassy was a good target that
would make headlines,'' the official said.
   The embassy, almost always crowded with people seeking visas, is
on a busy street off the beachfront.
   The army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, on Friday again
blamed Arafat for the raid. Arafat has denied involvement.
   ``It is difficult for me to say if he personally participated in
the secrets of the act itself and its preparations,`` Shomron said
on Israel television. ``But I have no doubt that his people know
something and that he has responsibility as the head of the
organization.''
   However, Israel's military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Amnon
Shahak, was quoted as saying earlier Friday that Arafat probably did
not know beforehand about the raid.
   Shahak also said Israel knew ``with complete certainty'' that the
PLO has planned attacks on Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel ``in
every possible location and at every opportunity.''
   The statement was the first public comment by security officials
about threats against Soviet immigrants. Israeli newspapers have
quoted officials as saying Israel stepped up security because of
expected guerrilla attacks on Soviet Jews, who are expected to pour
into Israel by the thousands as a result of relaxed emigration rules
in the Soviet Union.
   Arab nations oppose the influx, saying many of the immigrants may
choose to settle in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
and drive out Palestinians.

   First came Game Boy, a paperback-size video game
introduced less than a year ago by Nintendo. The battery-operated,
go-anywhere toy has the potential to be a $1 billion a year business.
   Then came Lynx, marketed nationwide a month ago by Atari Computer
Corp. as the first hand-held game with a color screen. It's twice as
pricey as the $90 Game Boy.
   Now get ready for TurboExpress, NEC's flashier version of putting
an arcade game into the palm of the hand. It has twice the computing
power of its competitors and uses the same game cartridges in its
home consoles, something its competitors can't match.
   And, get this: TurboExpress comes with an option that converts
the video game into a TV set. The cost per unit will be about $200
to $250, and the TV option is about $80.
   ``People pay for value,'' said Kenneth Wirt, vice president of
home entertainment for NEC Technologies Inc. ``If you get a lot of
use out of it, they're willing to pay more. This is something you
can't get from Nintendo.''
   It will be unveiled this weekend at the Consumer Electronics Show
in Chicago and will be on the market in the fall, just in time for
Christmas.
   But anything that hopes to compete with Nintendo, the undisputed
leader of home video games, has to be good.
   About 1 million copies of Game Boy's black-and-white, 2{-inch
diagonal screen were sold last year after it hit the market in
August.
   This year, Nintendo expects to sell 5 million sets. The hand-held
business will account for nearly $1 billion of the company's
projected sales of $4.1 billion, which gives Nintendo about 80
percent of the U.S. video game market.
   ``The Nintendo name rules,'' said Larry Carlat, editor of the New
York-based Toy and Game Magazine. ``Anything with a Nintendo name
puts everything else to shame as far as the mass market goes. If you
go head to head with Nintendo, you're going to lose. It's the kiss
of death.''
   He praised the wizardry of TurboExpress but questioned whether
kids would pay that much for it.
   ``The product is spectacular. The technology is startling,
innovative and brilliant,'' Carlat said. ``But I don't think it's
for everyone. They can get little pieces of the action at the high
end of the market. If they get the price down, they could give
Nintendo a run for the money.''
   Hand-held games are the latest advancements in the video game
world that Atari created with the introduction of ``Pong'' in 1976.
The improvements are like video game plots: things get flashier and
more sophisticated as the games go along.
   And if there are miniature stereos and cameras, why not miniature
arcades? Kids play them on school buses and in cars; businessmen
have been spotted with them on airline flights and trains.
   Since going nationwide in May, Lynx has sold 90 percent of the
50,000 units it shipped and expects to sell 500,000 units this year.
   Lynx is about the size of a video casette, slightly more than 4
inches high, 10 inches long and 1 inch thick. It has a 3{-inch
screen and runs on six AA batteries, although another power source
is an adapter that plugs into a car's cigarette lighter.
   Game Boy takes four batteries and gets 30 hours of play, about
five times of its competitors.
   ``We wanted to be at the high end of the technology and the
market,'' said Larry Siegel, vice president of software development
for Atari.
   And he considers Nintendo, not NEC, to be his real competition.
   ``NEC is not the one that keeps me awake at nights,'' Siegel
said. ``When you sleep next to an elephant, you're not worried about
getting scratched by the cat at the end of the bed.''
   NEC's TurboExpress can show 512 colors at once on its 2.7-inch
diagonal screen, compared with 16 colors shown at once on Lynx. The
unit is slightly more than 4 inches wide, 7 inches high and 1 inch
thick. Like Lynx, it weighs 1 pound and runs on six AA batteries. It
also has a cigarette lighter adapter.

   A three-day Arab summit ended with a whimper
rather than the anti-American bang that Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein wanted, because his hard-line allies were outnumbered by
more cautious heads.
   But if the conference, which ended Wednesday, did little to
bolster the unity the Arabs have sought or produce evidence of
cohesion in a bloc running from the Atlantic to the Persian Gulf, it
did boost Saddam's image as the new tough guy on the block.
   There was no sign that either Saddam or Syrian President Hafez
Assad is prepared to end their 11-year-old feud, the main obstacle
to Arab unity.
   Assad, Saddam's main Arab rival, boycotted the summit along with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi _ not surprisingly since Syrian
troops occupy two-thirds of his country.
   But Saddam can claim some success in simply gathering 16 of the
21 Arab heads of state in his capital.
   The Iraqi leader has palpable ambitions to be the Arab world's
paramount leader. He portrays himself as the Arab champion for
fighting Iran to a standstill in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, saying
this saved the Arabs from a Persian onslaught.
   Saddam can point to the summit as a display of Arab support
against what is perceived as a Western campaign against his
burgeoning military power.
   But he failed to parlay this into the broadside of condemnation
of U.S. support for Israel that he sought.
   Moderate leaders like King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt mustered enough support to mute criticism of
Washington and its perceived anti-Arab bias.
   The ostensible reason for the meeting was to find ways to block
large-scale emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel. Israeli officials
estimate about 750,000 Soviet Jews will arrive in the next few years.
   That would dramatically alter the demographic equation to which
the Arabs have subscribed for so long _ that the Arab population of
what used to be Palestine will eventually outstrip the number of
Jews.
   Arab hard-liners wanted to put the blame more on Washington and
less on Moscow because of what they see as the U.S. failure to
pressure Israel into peace negotiations.
   The Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, reportedly
insisted the Soviet Union also be condemned for the wave of
emigration to Israel.
   Anti-American sentiment was aggravated by a U.S. administration
letter urging the summit to ``moderate both action and rhetoric''
and avoid overheating the Middle East situation.
   Washington has accused Iraq of trying to illegally obtain
U.S.-made devices that could be used as triggers for nuclear
weapons. Baghdad denied this, saying the devices were needed for
laser research.
   But, in a new climate of uncertainty in the Middle East caused by
the Soviet Jewish emigration, the events in Eastern Europe and
growing economic pressures, the hard-liners had to back off.
   ``At the end of the day, the summit showed commendable
maturity,'' one gulf Arab minister said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The summit communique avoided direct condemnation of
the U.S. government.''
   The United States and the Soviet Union have ended their Cold War
and ``we Arabs can no longer count on playing East against West to
score political gains,'' he contended.
   ``Besides, we don't seem to have much leverage on either Moscow
or Washington,'' he added.
   ``America hijacked the Baghdad summit,'' lamented a Palestinian
leader.
   In the end, the Arabs threatened unspecified economic and
political sanctions against countries that assist Soviet Jews'
travel to Israel.
   But what effect this might have remains questionable, with
Eastern and Western Europe drawing closer together.

   After 12 years of pushing the conservative
cause in the U.S. Senate, political maverick Gordon Humphrey is
going home to New Hampshire to run for a $100-a-year seat in the
state Senate.
   Humphrey's run for the part-time job is no surprise to those who
watched the former airline pilot and political novice rise to the
national forefront of conservatism.
   ``Given his political career, nothing about it would surprise
me,'' said Republican political consultant Thomas Rath. ``He puts
the `un' in unorthodox.''
   Humphrey, 49, calls himself probably the Senate's most outspoken
anti-abortion voice, and at times has criticized Presidents Reagan
and Bush for not being conservative enough _ notably on taxes and
sanctions against China.
   He said he is running for state office partly because he thinks
New Hampshire is straying from its conservative roots.
   ``I think the conservative character of the state is being eroded
and that we've got to try to stop that,'' he said.
   He also believes politicians should not make Congress a career.
He has said he'd like to run for governor at some point, but not
while his friend, Gov. Judd Gregg, holds the office.
   Humphrey's reputation as a conservative's conservative is a far
cry from his early political experience. He was a Democratic
campaign volunteer and local Democratic official in Virginia in the
late 1960s and early 1970s, which he once called his ``shameful
past.''
   Humphrey moved to New Hampshire in 1974 and registered
Republican. He emerged as state coordinator of the New Hampshire
Conservative Caucus in 1977 and was elected senator the next year.
   The state Senate seat opened up because Republican William
Johnson is running for Congress _ to succeed Bob Smith, who's
running for Humphrey's Senate seat.
   Humphrey, who will make his candidacy official in about two
weeks, has one announced opponent in the Sept. 11 primary:
Republican Jack Sherburne, a state representative for eight years
and a selectman in Deerfield for 12.
   Though Humphrey already is looking beyond the primary and general
election to the internal contest for Senate president, Sherburne,
66, says Humphrey's candidacy does not faze him.
   ``I think it will make a heck of an interesting race,'' he said.
   Humphrey is vocally anti-abortion. Sherburne supports abortion
rights, saying society ``is not wise enough to substitute laws for a
woman's choice.''
   Humphrey says the way to balance budgets is to cut spending.
   Sherburne says everything should be on the table when New
Hampshire, which has no general sales or general income tax, writes
its next budget. Pinched by a sagging economy and widespread revolts
against ever-increasing property taxes, the state is in the midst of
a debate on tax reform.
   Rath and others predict that Humphrey will face a major
adjustment, away from a multimedia statewide campaign to a
door-to-door race in one of the state's 24 Senate districts.
   ``When the media focus goes away, what is left for him to work on
are basically the same issues we spend day in and day out working
on, and they are not as glamorous as those he worked on in
Washington,'' said Senate Republican Leader Edward Dupont, a likely
Senate president candidate.
   New Hampshire's senators usually work three days a week, six
months a year. Most share office space, and the Senate has one
shared media spokesman.
   ``You have to do it on your feet in the state Senate,'' Rath
said. ``It is a solitary job. You've got to read every bill
yourself. You just don't have a lot of staff to rely on.''
   Humphrey, whose annual U.S. Senate salary was $98,400,
anticipates no trouble adjusting.
   ``I feel very strongly about the importance of state and local
government and I have no doubt that one can be as fully engaged at
this level as in the Congress,'' he said.
   No Democrats have announced for the seat, but state party
Chairman Ned Helms said that if Humphrey wins the primary, the seat
would become ``more winable'' for Democrats. He called Humphrey ``a
right-wing zealot'' far removed from the mainstream of either party.

   To review or not to review.
   The dilemma has spun a web of controversy and conflict around
``Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' the first offering of an ambitious,
for-profit laboratory for new American musicals.
   A musical version of the film that won William Hurt an Oscar was
reviewed Friday in The New York Times by its chief theater critic,
Frank Rich, despite pleas by the organization presenting what it
calls a workshop production.
   The organization, New Musicals, says it had sought a no-review
policy from the media for its season of shows that began May 1 with
``Spider Woman.'' The musical is being performed through June 24 at
the State University of New York at Purchase, 25 miles north of New
York City.
   ``We tried to create an alternative method of development to
Broadway,'' Martin J. Bell, producing director of New Musicals, said
Thursday. ``If the Times policy stands, I would recommend to a
writer or a director that they do a show right on Broadway instead
of coming here. What they did was invade the work process here.''
   A review by Rich usually can make or break a show on Broadway.
New Musicals had hoped to keep The New York Times from reviewing the
show, which is undergoing changes and rewrites during its two-month
run in Purchase.
   A contingent from New Musicals, including Bell, met earlier in
May with Warren Hoge, assistant managing editor of the Times, and
with Marvin Siegel, its cultural editor, in an effort to persuade
the paper not to review ``Spider Woman.'' But they were not
successful.
   ``Reviewing the arts is one of the reader services provided by
The New York Times,'' said Hoge. ``This is a show involving some
very prominent and interesting people in the American musical
theater. It is presented to the public as a commercial enterprise,
charging a competitive price and it's playing in our town.
   ``We have covered the project (New Musicals) a number of times,
and we are covering the show. Any news organization is wary of
deliberately not covering something,'' Hoge added.
   Rich's review, largely negative, finds irony in what he describes
as the overly elaborate, Broadway-style staging.
   ``If anything, the tragedy of `Spider Woman' is that New
Musicals, which describes itself as a `new Broadway,' in its
promitional lterature, has not allowed the work to develop slowly in
a laboratory staging, as nonprofit, off-Broadway companies have
helped develop adventurous musicals like `A Chorus Line,' or `Sunday
in the Park With George,''' Rich wrote. ``Instead, `Spider Woman'
arrives already burdened with the full, and in this case crushing,
weight of Broadway extravagance.''
   Other New York critics were informed of the Times' decision to
review the show, and several decided to review the show before
Rich's notice came out.
   Clive Barnes, theater critic of the New York Post, said the
Times' review policy made it impossible for him to ignore the
musical. He panned the show in Thursday's newspaper, but was even
more scathing about the Times' policy for the show.
   ``A local occurrence has been transformed into a national
event,'' wrote Barnes, who used to be theater critic for the Times.
He said the Times' decision was ``inimical to the health of the
Broadway theater.''
   A Daily News critic will review the show Friday and other
critics, including those of Variety and The Associated Press, will
review it in the near future.
   Interest in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman'' has been high since the
project was announced in January. The musical involves some of
Broadway's biggest talents.
   The show is directed by Harold Prince, director of ``The Phantom
of the Opera,'' and has a book by playwright Terrence McNally. The
score was written by John Kander and Fred Ebb, the team behind
``Cabaret'' and ``Zorba.''
   Bell vowed that New Musicals, which has a first-year budget of
about $10 million, would continue its season of four shows. ``Spider
Woman''' will be followed by ``The Secret Garden,'' based on the
classic children's novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett. It runs Oct. 23
through Dec. 23.
   ``If I can't change the (Times) policy in the future, I have to
rethink the whole operation,'' Bell added. ``It makes us a very
different kind of place. I'm worried it will scare some important
artists away.''

   The Red Cross has begun raising money by
asking returning travelers to donate their loose foreign change,
officials said.
   Collection boxes have been installed at airports as well as gas
stations and banks across the country, said Johan af Donner, a
Swedish Red Cross executive.
   ``About three million Swedes go abroad per year. If each of them
gives us 10 kronor ($1.60) in foreign change we could collect as

   The campaign will continue through the summer, he said, and if
successful it may be taken up by other Red Cross branches.

   It rained nine days after an Indian
water ceremony, and Three Valleys Municipal Water District officials
coping with a four-year drought are impressed.
   ``I'm a pragmatic person,'' said Three Valleys Municipal Water
District executive Paul Stiglich, whose agency paid for the
ceremony. ``The Indians came. They danced. It rained. We'll probably
send them a thank you note.''
   Tony Romero, the 67-year-old patriarch of the Chumash Reservation
in Santa Ynez, said it wasn't exactly a rain dance. It was a water
ceremony, he said, an act of reverence for one of the Earth's
natural resources.
   Three Valleys provides water for about 500,000 residents of the
eastern San Gabriel Valley, 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   The district paid Romero and his family $1,000 to perform at an
annual water awareness luncheon on May 18. Nine days later, a
surprise one-inch deluge soaked the region. Not enough to stop the
drought, but a nice surprise, officials said.
   ``The whole idea was really for them just to share the reverence
they have for water and other natural resources. But I'm not going
to say it didn't help,'' said district General Manager Richard
Hansen.
   Romero said he doesn't have any power to make it rain, but he
notes if you pray hard enough your voice might just be heard.
   ``Everything we did was sincere and from the heart,'' Romero said
after the Memorial Day weekend storm. ``If they think it helped,
then don't spoil it for them.''

   A strong earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 6
on the Richter scale shook the Tokyo area this morning, the Central
Meteorological Agency said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or property damage
and no danger of a tsunami, or tidal wave, the agency said.
   It said the temblor, which hit at 10:22 a.m., was centered 31
miles underground in the Pacific Ocean about 8 miles off the east
coast of Chiba state, or about 29 miles east of Tokyo.
   New Tokyo International Airport at Narita, near the epicenter,
closed the runway for five minutes to check for damage.
   ``Buildings here shook quite violently, but there was no damage,
no broken windows or anything so far,'' said an airport official.
There was no delay of flights.
   Two rapid-transit ``bullet trains'' traveling northwest of Tokyo
halted for about six minutes, and other trains stopped to check for
track damage, officials said.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its
epicenter, according to ground motion as recorded on seismographs.
An earthquake of 6 on the scale is considered severe, capable of
widespread damage near the epicenter.
   The quake came days after a strong temblor hit Peru and another
quake hit Romania, Bulgaria, and southern Moldavia in the Soviet
Union.

   An unmanned module containing facilities to produce
high-quality semicondutors in zero gravity was launched to
rendezvous with the Mir space station, Soviet media reported.
   The Kristall space module is to link up June 6 with the Mir,
where cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and Alexander Balandin have been
working for nearly four months, according to Soviet TV and the Tass
news agency.
   The launch Thursday from the Baikonur Space Center in Soviet
Central Asia was delayed several times in recent days because of
computer problems, Tass said. The agency reported earlier in May
that the module's launch was postponed due to problems relating to
its eventual docking with the Mir. It did not elaborate.
   Once the spacecraft docks with the Mir, Solovyov and Balandin
will conduct technological experiments using the ``orbital
mini-plant,'' as flight technicians have dubbed the Kristall module,
Tass said.
   The semiconductors produced in zero gravity can be used in solar
batteries aboard the Mir, Tass said. The Kristall module reportedly
contains enough material to produce several solar battery elements.
   Scientists want to compare the quality of the material produced
in orit with that manufactured on Earth, Tass said.

   No college? No problem, if you'd like to
collect a sheepskin from the University of Hard Knocks, where Phi
Beta Kappa keys are scorned and graduates include Jesse Helms and W.
Clement Stone.
   ``We absolutely will not take a college graduate,'' says founder
Jim Comstock. ``We're very firm on that point.''
   Comstock, 79, decided to take an old adage one step further in
1947. Since then he has awarded nearly 2,000 degrees. He has no
campus and holds no classes, but graduates from as far away as
Canada will gather Saturday night for an annual commencement
ceremony.
   Applicants must be successful in a particular field, donate $100
to their prospective alma mater and buy a subscription to the
Hillbilly, which offers a mix of news, poetry and a satirical column
written by Comstock.
   Comstock, editor of the weekly West Virginia Hillbilly newspaper,
has befriended presidents, politicians and other celebrities through
his university, called UHK by its alumni.
   Hard Knocks graduates include U.S. Sens. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and
Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; former U.S. Sen. Barry Goldwater; Charles O.
Finley, former owner of the Oakland A's; Tulsa bank millionaire Lee
Braxton; ventriloquist Jimmy Nelson; Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor of
The Washington Times; and Chicago insurance magnate W. Clement Stone.
   ``There's a lot of people in the public eye who won't admit they
didn't go to college,'' Comstock said. ``They have to be very
successful to admit they didn't go to college.''
   Comstock said this year's graduating class of 40 will receive
their degrees _ printed in the school colors, black and blue _ at
Alderson-Broaddus College in Philippi.
   Comstock, who lives in Richwood, about 45 miles east of
Charleston, said he began granting degrees on a whim to bolster the
sagging ego of his partner in the Hillbilly.
   ``My former partner, Bronson McClung, was kind of down one day
because he didn't have a college degree and I did,'' said Comstock,
a Marshall University graduate. ``He said, `We ain't paired
correctly.'''
   Comstock found some fancy paper, had ``University of Hard
Knocks'' stamped across the top, scribbled in some Latin and
presented the ``diploma'' to McClung.
   McClung later left the newspaper and opened a successful bank.
   ``I graduated with honors,'' McClung said. ``The idea was
fabulous.''
   Hard Knock graduates are a proud breed.
   ``I've got a doctorate from UHK, '' said John Hughes, president
of the Archibald Candy Corp., which makes Fannie May candy. ``I
suppose it's because I'm a double dropout. I dropped out of high
school, got my high school equivalent degree, then dropped out of
college.''
   Nelson, an assistant vice president for a Cape Coral, Fla., bank
and a member of the UHK Class of 1984, keeps his diploma on a wall
in his office.
   ``I'm very proud of it'' said Nelson, who captured a national
television audience in the early 1950s as the voice behind his
ventriloquist's dummies, Danny O'Day and Farfel, a philosophical dog
with floppy ears.
   ``I work with college graduates all around me,'' said Nelson, who
started in show business after high school. ``Most people think it's
a joke, but it isn't. .. It's kind of tongue-in-cheek. But it's nice
to have something on the wall that means something.''

   A black college student who complained she was the
victim of a campaign of racial harassment likely staged the
incidents herself, the prosecutor said Thursday.
   However, Emory University freshman Sabrina Collins won't be
prosecuted for the allegedly false accusations, which were widely
reported at a time when racial tension seemed to be on the rise on
U.S. college campuses.
   Authorities hinted from early on they were suspicious the
scrawled racist invective in Ms. Collins' dormitory room was a hoax,
even though the harassment was said to have caused her to collapse,
unable to speak, on April 10. But neither university officials,
police nor prosecutors publicly stated those suspicions.
   On Thursday, DeKalb County Solicitor Ralph Bowden released a
letter to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation saying he wouldn't
press charges against Ms. Collins. The letter suggests, but doesn't
state, that he has concluded she staged the harassment.
   ``There certainly is some direct evidence, and a great deal of
circumstantial evidence, that would cause one to believe that
Sabrina was the only person involved in these matters,'' Bowden told
The New York Times. ``That is certainly the conclusion of the
investigating agencies, and I have no quarrel with that, based on a
reading of their reports.''
   Bowden's office prosecutes misdemeanors. A letter similar to his
was released Thursday by DeKalb County District Attorney Bob Wilson,
who handles misdemeanors.
   ``There is substantial evidence which contradicts Ms. Collins'
allegations,'' Wilson's letter says.
   Ms. Collins' attorney, James Howard, disputed those who blame the
incidents on her.
   ``It is apparent that the person who inflicted this pain and
suffering upon her is not only free to do it again but has succeeded
in evading the investigation,'' Howard said in a statement issued
Thursday.
   State Rep. Tyrone Brooks of Atlanta, who has been an advisor to
Emory students in the wake of the Collins incident, urged
authorities to keep the investigation open and prosecute, even if
Ms. Collins is found to be the culprit.
   ``What they want to do is blame the victim, place a cloud over
the victim publicly in the media, and then walk away,'' Brooks said.
``The investigation should not be left just hanging in the air.
Whomever is responsible for these acts of vandalism needs to be
apprehended and prosecuted, no matter who it is.''
   The Times, quoting unidentified officials familiar with an
unreleased report by the state bureau of investigation, said it
noted her accounts of harassment apparently coincided with a
university investigation of suspicions she cheated in a chemistry
class.
   In declining to prosecute, Bowden said it appeared Ms. Collins
suffered from serious emotional problems. He suggested counseling
and treatment.
   Ms. Collins was hospitalized after she collapsed and became mute
April 10. Her family said she had lifted a rug in her room and found
the words ``die nigger die'' scribbled in nail polish on the floor.
   Some students held silent protests and group meetings, saying
racism is a time-honored tradition at Emory, where 7 percent of the
9,500 students are black.
   Ms. Collins earlier had reported incidents in which pictures were
broken, bleach was poured on some of her clothes, stuffed animals
were mutilated and the phrase ``nigger, hang'' was found written on
the wall in her closet.
   Emory police first said they couldn't understand how the
incidents continued after they installed an alarm in Ms. Collins'
room. They later theorized that someone had entered the room only
once, concealing some of the vandalism so it would be discovered
later.

   The barber cutting Paul Ridgeway's hair had to
negotiate the telephones pressed to each of the coordinator's ears.
   ``The phones ring simultaneously, like a choir,'' Ridgeway said,
scrambling to orchestrate Twin Cities festivities for Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's historic visit.
   Ridgeway is the lead U.S. coordinator for the Gorbachev visit.
He's had just two weeks since Sunday's visit was announced, making
his job ``like taking a 500-pound watermelon and squeezing it into a
two-pound box.''
   It's Thursday now, and Ridgeway paces the floor of his suite in
the Radisson Plaza Hotel (his ``sanctuary''), talking on a portable
telephone. His white shirt is rumpled. He wears tennis shoes. He
needs a shave.
   Twenty hours a day, Ridgeway is planning every detail for the
visit, down to ordering beer for the Soviet entourage.
   It's a job he lobbied for.
   ``For an advance person, to advance Gorbachev is like an artist
working with Michelangelo,'' Ridgeway said. ``Twenty years from now,
you'll get to say, `I was involved with the Gorbachev trip.' ''
   Ridgeway, 41, has handled logistics for other major events: the
Minnesota Twins' victory parade in 1987, a Super Bowl halftime show
two years ago, this year's National Right to Life Rally in
Washington, D.C.; President Carter's visits to Minnesota and Korea
and Hubert H. Humphrey's funeral.
   But Gorbachev's visit is the most complicated event Ridgeway has
tackled. He snatches three or four hours of sleep in his hotel room
and conducts an interview while eating a sandwich.
   ``Honestly, in the last two weeks, I saw my kids for 2{ hours for
lunch, which was interrupted by phone calls and people and by two TV
things,'' Ridgeway said.
   ``My wife reminded me of the old saying: `My family has total
recall. They see me once, and never forgot me.'''
   Those who have worked with Ridgeway cite his energy and
efficiency.
   ``He's the best outside man and special events man in the
business today,'' said Tom Jardine, vice president of public
relations and public affairs at Carlson Companies Inc., where
Ridgeway worked from 1980 to 1986.
   ``He can do it all. He's really almost a one-man show. He can
assemble and organize people with the speed of lightning,'' Jardine
said.
   As of Thursday, the itinerary for Gorbachev's visit had not been
set. The only definite stops were a luncheon at the governor's
mansion in St. Paul and a meeting with business and agricultural
leaders at the Radisson Plaza.
   But Ridgeway has had to check out other potential sites for the
Soviet president and his wife, Raisa, to visit: a dairy farm near
Farmington, the home of a ``typical American family'' in south
Minneapolis, and the Cathedral of St. Paul for a possible ecumenical
service to pray for peace and friendship.
   ``We set up in 24 hours what most people can't set up in a
week-and-a-half,'' Ridgeway said. ``Once the venues are picked ...
then boom! Away we go.''
   Ridgeway depends on businesses to underwrite costs and on
hundreds of volunteers. His advance team numbers about 65 people,
not including drivers.
   ``We've got people from all over Minnesota working on this,''
Ridgeway said. ``It really does take a team. You can't do this
alone.''
   Ridgeway said he doesn't mind the hectic pace.
   ``Certainly, it's a tight timeline,'' he said, ``but you know,
`No guts, no glory.' ''

<HEAD>Government Restrictions and Fear Hamper AIDS Control, Says Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Worldwide public fears of AIDS and harsh government
controls have created a separate ``epidemic'' of discrimination,
forcing many AIDS sufferers into hiding and hampering efforts to
control the disease, a report says.
   The report's author, Martin Foreman, said voluntary measures that
respect the rights of people most at risk are the best way of
containing the deadly disease.
   The 320-page report, ``The Third Epidemic,'' was written by the
Panos Institute and the Norwegian Red Cross. It was released
Thursday.
   Foreman heads a unit at the Panos Institute, an international
research and policy studies institute with offices in London. The
organization has collected information on AIDS, particularly in
developing countries, since 1986.
   The report noted that Iraq requires all foreigners staying longer
than five days to take blood tests, while Cyprus only tests African
students and cabaret artists and other countries just check would-be
immigrants.
   The report cited dozens of cases of discrimination against people
who have AIDS or HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that causes
it.
   ``In almost every country, people testing positive for HIV have
been sacked from their jobs, disowned by their families, rejected by
friends, refused treatment by doctors and turned down by schools and
colleges,'' the report said.
   Foreman said the hostility was the ``third epidemic'' after the
HIV infection and the later appearance of AIDS in the early 1980s.
   ``(It is) a social infection ... the denial, blame and
stigmatization which the fear of AIDS brings out in individuals and
societies,'' Foreman told a news conference.
   He said that controls such as compulsory blood tests on
prostitutes or soldiers and immigration curbs have not only failed
to contain the virus but have ``almost certainly had the opposite
effect.''
   ``If people who are HIV-positive are subject to a series of legal
measures in addition to society's hostility, those at risk will
steer clear of any situation in which they might be identified as
carrying the virus,'' said Foreman.
   The report said the most effective method of containing the virus
was to ``win the confidence of those most affected by the disease.''
   In addition to fear, the AIDS stigma often masks racism or
prejudices against the high-risk groups: homosexual men, drug
abusers and prostitutes, said Foreman.
   AIDS is a deadly affliction in which a virus attacks the body's
immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of
infections and cancers. It is spread mainly by sexual contact
between homosexual men, the use of contaminated needles among drug
abusers, and transfusion of tainted blood.
   The report said students from Africa, reported to be the world's
worst-hit region, used to be regularly abused with racist remarks in
Moscow or Beijing. ``Now they might hear ... the Russian or Chinese
words for AIDS,'' it said.
   At least 24 countries now require certificates from some or all
foreign visitors _ mainly students and others seeking to stay more
than six months _ that they do not carry the AIDS virus, the report
said.
   The U.S. government relaxed its immigration restrictions in April
to try to defuse protests, including a boycott of an international
conference on AIDS in San Francisco this summer.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said foreigners
can get 10-day visas to attend business, professional or scientific
conferences without revealing whether they carry the virus.
   However, the report said that for ethical and practical reasons,
no other countries were likely to follow Cuba's lead in establishing
a compulsory isolation program.
   Cuba screened all its 10.4 million citizens in 1986 and detained
the hundredth of a percent who proved positive at a sanatorium on
the outskirts of Havana.
   Other countries with compulsory screening of high-risk groups
include South Korea, which screens prostitutes. South Africa has a
law providing for the screening of all immigrants, but it is in
practice applied only to black mine workers, the report said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Once Again, Gorbachev Upstages a President</HEAD>

   George Bush took it with grace, but Mikhail
Gorbachev did it again. He upstaged the president just as he had
grabbed the spotlight from Ronald Reagan.
   ``You know I'm jealous about air time,'' Bush laughed. ``It's
terrible.''
   While Bush kept a low profile for most of the day Thursday,
Gorbachev was out shaking hands on the sidewalk, holding impromptu
news conferences and having lunch and discourse with the likes of
Jesse Jackson, Jane Fonda, Gregory Peck and other prominent
Americans.
   Bush, who remained out of the limelight after his public greeting
of Gorbachev for their first meeting of the day, finally emerged
from his office for a brief Rose Garden news conference after the
Soviet leader had stolen most of the television coverage.
   The president observed it was ``the end of a very interesting
day.''
   And how is his chemistry with Gorbachev?
   ``Well, I don't know,'' the U.S. president said. ``That's a good
question.''
   ``I feel very comfortable with him. I feel very free to bring up
positions that I know he doesn't agree with. And that hasn't always
been the case. There have been times when people banged their shoes
when they didn't agree. That's not the mood or the tone of this
meeting.''
   The current Soviet leader's antics don't match Nikita
Khrushchev's pugnacious shoe-banging at the United Nations three
decades ago. But Gorbachev has proved to be as volatile and
unpredictable.
   Gorbachev stole the spotlight from Reagan during their December
1987 summit when he stopped his motorcade and jumped out to shake
hands with bystanders. That also caught then vice-president Bush _ a
passenger in Gorbachev's limousine _ by surprise.
   The Soviet leader did the same thing Thursday, hopping from his
car and plunging into a crowd of several hundred people about a
block from the White House.
   Gorbachev also spoke to reporters on the driveway outside the
White House _ once on his way to see Bush for their afternoon
meeting and then again, at considerable length, on his way out.
   The Soviet leader dislosed the fact that he and Bush had dealt in
depth with the issue of German unity and had assigned Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to continue to press the search for common ground.
   ``We understand the position of each other,'' Gorbachev said of
his second meeting of the day with Bush. ``I hope that we understand
each other's concerns better as well.''
   The tactic clearly caught the White House press office _ and most
reporters following the summit _ off guard. The White House had
moved its entire press operation to the gymnasium of George
Washington University six blocks from the White House.
   Gorbachev's comments came hours before White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater and his Soviet counterpart, Arkady
Maslennikov, were to hold a joint briefing and read a statement on
the Bush-Gorbachev talks concerning Germany.
   At that briefing, Fitzwater noted that Gorbachev outside the
White House and Bush in the Rose Garden had pretty well covered the
subject. And Maslennikov joked: ``We can dispense with the briefing.
Everything was said.''
   Although the president has held 50 news conferences so far _ more
in 16 months in office than Reagan held in eight years _ and is
known for keeping a frenetic schedule both in the White House and
about town, he has been laying low this week.
   He made no public appearances on Tuesday and Wednesday. And on
Thursday, nothing was on Bush's public schedule during the almost
four hours between the end of his first meeting with Gorbachev and
the beginning of his second.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said that Bush used some of
the time to meet with advisers to discuss the first summit session.
``He's also got a country to run,'' Popadiuk said.
   But finally, Bush ambled out into the Rose Garden _ to a hastily
assembled group of reporters _ to get equal time.
   Had he noticed a change in the Soviet leader since their first
summit at Malta last December? ``He's six months older,'' Bush said.
   But, he added, ``there's a certain strength and confidence that
was there in Malta and certainly is still there now. And you can
feel that.''
   And, the president added, he thinks he and Gorbachev take each
other seriously. ``I can talk very frankly with him. When he talks,
I listen; and when I talk, he listens. We're not shouting at each
other.''

<HEAD>Summit Film Festival: A Celluloid Catharsis from Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A naive young man is transformed into a
corrupt, calculating bureaucrat in a recent Soviet film called ``The
Villain.'' Ivan Minas-Bekov jokes that he knows him.
   ``I understand everything about this mafia, black-market
person,'' says Minas-Bekov, a violinist who emigrated here in 1982
to be with his only daughter. ``One is my neighbor in Baku. That's
my city where I was born.''
   ``The Villain'' is typical of the films being shown during the
superpower summit this week at a Soviet film festival. Together,
they amount to a celluloid catharsis.
   Virtually every film is a grim look at some aspect of the Soviet
Union's cruel history or current troubles. Occasionally the gloom is
disguised as farce, but the themes are the same _ Siberian prisons,
Stalinist oppression, heroic resistance, bureaucratic hypocrisy and
the guilt of torturers.
   Emigres, scholars and plain old film buffs have been filling the
64-seat Mary Pickford Theater at the Library of Congress since the
Soviet festival began last Friday.
   And what they are seeing was made possible by the Kremlin itself,
through the Soviet Embassy. The embassy suggested the festival as an
adjunct to the Bush-Gorbachev summit and offered a large choice of
films _ all of them brutally critical of the Soviet Union.
   ``They didn't seem concerned about that at all,'' said Patrick
Loughney, the theater curator who selected the films. ``There was no
attempt to talk us into one film or another... My feeling is they
just want the world to see their films. There's not so much worry
about the content.''
   Most of the eight festival films are from 1989 and only one was
made before 1987. Loughney describes them as ``depictions of the
Russian soul in torment.'' All are so scathing that the filmmakers
``could only be doing this with official encouragement,'' he said.
   On a brilliantly sunny Thursday afternoon, there were few empty
seats as the projectionist cranked up a three-hour drama called
``From the Life of Fyodor Kuzkin.'' The story of a peasant's
struggle against Stalin's forced collectivization drive of 1929, it
featured flashbacks, dream sequences and a stark style reminiscent
of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman.
   When Wednesday's scheduled film failed to show, the Soviet
Embassy obliged by quickly sending a substitute. This was ``The
Villain,'' a film made in Azerbaijan.
   ``It was so bleak in terms of how it showed Soviet society that I
was totally dumbfounded that the embassy would put this forth,''
said Tom van der Voort, a consultant on federal budget matters and a
self-described inveterate movie-goer.
   One film, ``The Fountain,'' was described in festival literature
as a satirical portrait of ``everyday Soviet life, including black
market schemes, marital feuds in tight quarters, and hypocritical
bureaucrats masquerading as reformers.'' It got laughs, Loughney
said, but one emigre told him later that he didn't find it funny _
it was too true.
   Another offering, ``Our Armored Train,'' tells the story of a
retired gulag official forced to confront his past actions. It ends
with his suicide. Still another recounts a boy's escape from a
detention camp to search for his father, who has been unjustly
imprisoned in Siberia.
   Minas-Bekov and his wife, Nina, a language teacher, have attended
several of the screenings and say they are somewhat surprised by
what they are seeing. For example, they said, it would have been
impossible to see a movie like ``The Villain'' in the Soviet Union
while they lived there.
   ``Many things are changed,'' Ivan said. ``For us it's very hard
to imagine,'' added his wife. But unlike some of her compatriots,
Nina Minas-Bekov said the films do not depress her. ``We knew about
it all before,'' she said. ``We could see.''

   The English National Opera has announced a 1990-91
season made up exclusively of 20th-century works, except for three
Mozart operas chosen to mark the bicentenary of the composer's death.
   The season of 22 operas will consist of nine new productions,
including one world premiere and 13 revivals. It begins Aug. 23 and
ends June 22, 1991.
   Planned highlights include new stagings of Alban Berg's
``Wozzeck,'' Benjamin Britten's ``Peter Grimes,'' and Claude
Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande.''
   The revivals range from Dmitri Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk,'' Sergei Prokofiev's ``The Love For Three Oranges,'' and
Richard Strauss's ``Salome.''
   Peter Jonas, who this fall starts his sixth year as general
director, said the lineup is intended ``to shift the balance of the
operatic repertoire an inch closer to our own times.''

   Afghans, Koreans and other protesters trying to
get messages through to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev aren't
making much headway, and so far have been outnumbered by tourists,
office-workers and police at their assembly site across from the
White House.
   For Thursday's opening summit session between Gorbachev and
President Bush, the demonstrators in Lafayette Park filled only a
tiny portion of the city-block-sized greenery. Including onlookers
and a number of homeless people who normally inhabit the park, the
crowd peaked at no more than 400.
   Police reported no violent incidents or arrests.
   During Gorbachev's two trips to the White House during the day,
officers kept the protesters behind snow fences at least 100 yards
from the fenced perimeter of the mansion's grounds.
   At the end of the day, no more than 60 demonstrators remained in
the park. Although two of them blared their protestations into
electronic speakers, most stood quietly and politely, holding
hand-lettered signs and answering questions from reporters.
   ``I've been handing out leaflets and talking to the press,'' said
James Amshoff, a New York City salesman and a member of the New
Testament Church, which believes only Jesus Christ _ not world
leaders _ can bring peace. ``We also took a break to pray.''
   Evening rush hour traffic inched along Pennsylvania Avenue
between the park and the White House during the afternoon session
between the two presidents.
   Back in the park, Michail Makarenko sported a gas mask while
contending that any help or support the U.S. government gives
Gorbachev is hurting the Soviet people. Makarenko said he was a
political prisoner for 11 years in the Soviet Union.
   ``It's not Gorbachev who is giving something,'' the 59-year-old
Makarenko said through a translator, Gregory Burnside. ``It is the
people who are resisting who are tearing it from his throat.''
   A half-dozen members of the Committee for Peace, Disarmament and
Reunification of Korea urged an end to Cold War tensions there.
   ``The message is that in this recent atmosphere of easing
international tensions, Korea still remains an island of Cold War,''
said spokeswoman Chung Hong. ``The two leaders have a special
responsibility because the division and the militarization of Korea
is a byproduct of the U.S.-Soviet relations forged after World War
II.''
   Seventy-five Cuban exiles seeking freedom for their homeland were
redirected from Lafayette Park to the Ellipse on the other side of
the White House, where they had their permit to demonstrate, said
Maj. Carl Holmberg of the U.S. Park Police.
   Six Buddhists who favor total disarmament pounded Japanese
Buddhist prayer drums and chanted a prayer for world peace as they
burned incense and sat cross-legged on the ground facing a small
statue of Buddha.
   ``We're offering our prayer in support of Bush and Gorbachev,''
said Jerry Talandis of Amherst, Mass., a 26-year-old social worker.
``We don't want them to stop until they have total nuclear
disarmament.''
   Earlier in the day, the Moscow rock group Gaza played for the
second consecutive day to call attention to the devastation of AIDS,
and gathering the largest crowd.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are the U.S.-Soviet
agreements expected to be signed today by President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a White House ceremony:
   _A ``framework'' accord on the major elements of a Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks, or START, treaty to reduce each side's arsenal of
long-range nuclear weapons by about one-third over a 7-year period.
Negotiating teams were still trying to work out some details during
the first day of the summit Thursday.
   _An accord ending production of U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons
and eliminating all but 5,000 tons of their existing chemical
stockpiles. The deal is meant as a catalyst for a global agreement
to ban production and possession of these weapons.
   _A protocol spelling out anti-cheating measures for existing
treaties that limit nuclear tests. The verification protocol will
permit both nations to ratify the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and
the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, which limit U.S. and
Soviet underground nuclear tests to 150 kilotons.
   _Expanding commercial air travel between the United States and
the Soviet Union by adding four American and six Soviet cities to
current airliner routes. It also will allow one more Soviet and six
more U.S. airlines to run the routes.
   _A new 5-year atomic energy agreement to provide closer
cooperation in nuclear reactor safety, fusion energy and basic
atomic science.
   _A grain deal committing the Soviets to buying at least 10
million tons annually, starting next year, of U.S. wheat, feed
grains and soybeans. That is an increase of 1 million tons annually
from a current agreement that took effect in 1983.
   _A maritime transportation pact to make it easier for U.S. and
Soviet commercial vessels to deliver goods to ports in one another's
country.
   _Opening reciprocal cultural and information centers in
Washington and Moscow.
   _The first government-to-government agreement to increase student
exchanges between the two countries.

   NATO has canceled plans to build a $500-million
center for training pilots in low-level flying because of warming
relations between East and West, a respected defense journal
reported.
   Jane's Defense Weekly reported the decision in its June 2
edition, released Thursday. It said the decision was made by
alliance defense ministers during a meeting last week in Brussels.
   Canada and Turkey had vied for the base for five years at
considerable cost and effort, Jane's said.
   ``The decision was taken in the light of recent shifts in East
Europe, changes in NATO requirements and the high cost of
establishing the base,'' the journal quoted an unidentified diplomat
as saying.
   The center would have trained fighter pilots from 11 NATO air
forces to fly up to 40,000 low-level practice runs each year, the
journal said.
   Jane's quoted officials in Brussels as saying the demise of the
project meant North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces would be
left to make their own arrangements for training in low-level flying.

   Children under 18 are fined $25 if caught
smoking cigarettes in Woodridge, Ill., one of the few places where
laws against smoking by minors are enforced.
   ``It is well documented that these laws are seldom enforced,''
U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Antonia Novello said Thursday, noting that
44 states have statutes forbidding tobacco sales to minors.
   ``More than 3,000 teen-agers become regular smokers each day,''
she said. ``If current smoking rates were to continue in the United
States, then about 5 million of the children now living in this
country would die of smoking-related disease.''
   Those statistics so concerned Woodridge Police Officer Bruce
Talbot that he wrote a city ordinance against smoking by youths. He
said the Illinois statute was too weak to be effective.
   Talbot said the city law forbidding anyone under 18 from
purchasing or possessing tobacco is enforced like the seat belt law.
   ``If we catch them doing something else wrong and also find them
with cigarettes, we write a ticket (for tobacco possession),'' he
said. ``You write just a few of those and word spreads among the
kids.''
   Talbot was one of the speakers at a conference called by Novello
to gather information to bolster the Bush administration's campaign
against smoking by youths.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan recently
released a proposal for legislation that could be adopted by states
to set up or strengthen laws against teen-age smoking.
   Another speaker at the conference, John Joyce of the Maine
Grocers' Association, said he favored fining the minor or the clerk
who sells tobacco to a minor, but he is opposed to licensing store
owners who sell cigarettes.
   ``That would just be another way for the state to raise money to
use for some unrelated purpose,'' said Joyce. ``Maine already
collects $40 million from tobacco taxes. Why not use that for
enforcement?''
   He said that if the clerk or minor knew they could be fined for
dealing in cigarettes, they would be deterred.
   Licensing and fines were among the suggestions in Sullivan's
model legislation. Also included are provisions for posting signs
publicizing the law in places were cigarettes are sold, setting 19
as the legal age for using tobacco and banning cigarette vending
machines.
   Tom McMann, a spokesman for the vending machine industry, said
only 3.5 percent of the cigarettes sold in the United States in 1988
came from vending machine and the numbers are decreasing.
   ``A ban would only hasten an industry already in decline,'' he
said.
   He said he favored placing some of the burden on youths by making
possession illegal.
   ``A sign on a machine that says it's illegal to sell to minors
doesn't bother them,'' he said.
   Novello accused the tobacco industry of spending $3.3 billion
annually to advertise and promote their products in ways that appeal
to children and adolescents.
   A spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute, interviewed later, said
cigarette companies do not want children as their customers.
   ``For decades we have taken aggressive actions to keep cigarettes
out of the hands of kids,'' Brennan Dawson said. She said
advertising is aimed not at creating new smokers but at selling
tobacco products to people who already smoke.
   ``What causes teens to smoke is peer pressure and the influence
of elders in a child's life,'' said Dawson. ``Those are the issues
that need to be addressed.''
   The tobacco spokeswoman said smoking among teen-agers is down.
About 20 percent of all high school students now smoke, compared
with 30 percent in the 1970s, she said.
   But smoking among young women is up, said the surgeon general.
   She said they now smoke at a greater rate than young men,
according to the Annual Survey of Drug Use by High School Seniors,
sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
   ``Lung cancer has already overtaken breast cancer as the number
one cause of cancer death among women,'' Novello said. ``If we fail
to reduce smoking among girls, the epidemic of lung cancer among
women will continue to grow well into the next century.''

   The Soviets weren't dressed in black tie, Raisa
Gorbachev didn't eat her meat, and her husband still didn't seem to
be on a first-name basis with President Bush.
   But none of that dampened the conviviality at Thursday night's
White House dinner in honor of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and his wife. It was the social event of the year.
   ``I think we were all happy,'' declared Academy Award-winning
actress Jessica Tandy, who was seated at a table with President Bush
and Mrs. Gorbachev.
   Another guest, evangelist Billy Graham, pronounced the evening
``terrific,'' and ``one of the great evenings of my life.'' He said
people were in an optimistic mood about the progress of the summit.
   American mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade entertained the 130
guests in the East Room after dinner with several opera numbers and
such American classics as ``Summertime'' and songs from the musical
``Showboat.''
   Gorbachev leaped up to shake her hand after the performance and
his wife kissed the singer on both cheeks.
   ``Barbara and I knew that President and Mrs. Gorbachev loved
music,'' Bush said following the performance. ``We could think of no
finer art than opera to transcend the differences and bring out the
things we have in common.''
   One thing Mrs. Gorbachev didn't have in common with many of the
guests was an appreciation for the roasted filet of beef mascotte
with green peppercorn sauce that was served at dinner. She left hers
on the plate, but did eat the Maine lobster, observers said.
   No one seemed to know if the Soviet first lady normally doesn't
eat red meat or simply wasn't that hungry.
   As is customary for Soviet dignitaries, the Gorbachevs showed up
dressed more informally than the tuxedo-clad and bejeweled Americans
at the black-tie dinner.
   He wore a dark business suit and she wore a tea-length,
three-piece dress with a black, green and pink floral design.
Traditional Soviet thinking holds that formal attire is elitist.
   Bush and the other American men wore tuxedos. Mrs. Bush was
attired in a new sapphire blue gown by her favorite designer, Arnold
Scaasi.
   After the entertainment, the Gorbachevs did not stay for the
dancing in the White House grand foyer. Instead they were escorted
by the Bushes to their waiting limousine and drove back to the
Soviet Embassy for the night.
   Bush then twirled the first lady around the floor to ``Shall We
Dance'' before Secretary of State James A. Baker III cornered him
for an extended and animated discussion in the middle of the dance
floor.
   In their formal toasts during dinner, Bush and Gorbachev
addressed one another as ``Mr. President'' rather than by first
names, a style which Bush prefers with other heads of state.
   ``Mr. President,'' Bush told his counterpart, ``it is said that
your country is the land of possibilities. You have demonstrated the
truth of that statement, and we've seen this past year that ours is
a world of possibilities, that ours is a time of historic change, a
time when men and nations can transform history.''
   The Soviet president said his country no longer sees the United
States as an enemy. He also paid tribute to national difference.
   ``Ideological stereotypes are fading away,'' he said. ``We have
come to understand each other's motives. As we are changing and
coming closer to each other, we have not ceased to be different. But
it turns out that that is not so bad. Quite the opposite, it is
useful, for diversity is a vital force of development.''
   He made a favorable impression, guests said.
   ``Everybody wanted to see what he would say and how he would say
it,'' said Treasury Secretary Nick Brady. ``His speech was well
received and so was the president's.''
   Bush's daughter-in-law, Sharon Bush of Denver, gave Mrs.
Gorbachev a good review as well, calling her ``very warm and nice.''
   Among other guests, in addition to administration officials and
members of Congress, were actress Tandy's husband, Hume Cronyn, and
Morgan Freeman, her co-star in the Academy Award best picture
``Driving Miss Daisy.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may not have the
means to carry out a treaty he is expected to sign to destroy Soviet
stocks of chemical weapons.
   Western officials say that the Kremlin last year closed its only
facility able to carry out the task, and has disclosed no plans to
build another.
   ``There has been no public announcement and the Soviets have made
no communication to the United States on their plans to destroy the
weapons,'' said a Western official involved in the negotiations.
   ``We still have no idea how they plan to do it,'' the official
said, speaking on condition he not be further identified.
   Top U.S. and Soviet leaders have been silent about this curious
aspect of the chemical weapons pact.
   Spokesmen at the Soviet ministries of defense and foreign affairs
declined to discuss how they will fulfill the prospective treaty,
which has been touted by U.S. and Soviet officials as a highlight of
the Washington summit.
   The pact, concluded when the U.S. and Soviet foreign ministers
met in Moscow in May, requires the superpowers to destroy 80 percent
of their chemical weapons immediately. They would reduce their
stocks to 2 percent of existing levels in the next eight years, and
destroy the rest two years later if all other countries capable of
producing chemical weapons join them in a global ban, officials said.
   The United States has an estimated 30,000 tons and the Soviets
50,000 tons of the weapons, according to government sources and
independent experts.
   The U.S. Army tested a destruction facility on Johnston Atoll in
the Pacific Ocean this spring and is building similar plants in six
states.
   The Soviets built a destruction plant in Chapayevsk, 550 miles
southwest of Moscow, but last summer it fell victim to the growing
environmental movement.
   Residents of Chapayevsk, a center of the Soviet chemical
industry, complained the plant would add to already high levels of
pollution in their city, and it was never used.
   Unable to calm the residents' fears, Soviet officials closed the
facility and asked the Supreme Soviet legislature to find a safe
site to build a new one. So far, none of the lawmakers has
volunteered a district for the new plant.
   After the Chapayevsk facility was closed, Sheila Buckley, the top
Pentagon chemical arms negotiator, said in a speech that ``we do not
believe that they are able right now to destroy the amount they
claim to have, which is 50,000 tons.'' There is no indication the
situation has changed, U.S. analysts say.
   U.S. Rep. Larry Hopkins, R-Ky., visited the Chapayevsk site last
summer and suggested to Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Defense Minister Dmitry T. Yazov that the United States share
technology with the Soviets to destroy the weapons.
   ``The Soviets are more inclined to go that route than the
Americans but have not made any concrete requests,'' the Western
official said.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Yuri A. Gremitskykh,
declined to disclose his government's plans for destroying the
chemicals.
   ``Now there will be negotiations on this issue between the
presidents, and experts and ministers. And we hope there will be a
written agreement. And then, then we will give you an answer about
how we will be destroying these agreed upon quantities of chemical
weapons,'' Gremitskykh said.
   Five officials in the press office of the Soviet Ministry of
Defense declined to discuss Soviet plans to destroy chemical
weapons. They referred a reporter to a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
official, who asked for a letter requesting an interview on the
subject.
   Baker, after meeting in Moscow with Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, was euphoric on announcing the
makings of the deal May 19.
   ``We have reached agreement on a precedent-setting accord,''
Baker told reporters. ``We believe that this agreement is very
significant, particularly as it provides a real pathway toward a
global ban on horrific weapons that we already know from bitter
experience actually get used.''
   The Soviet plan for the Chapayevsk plant had been to destroy two
chemicals also found in the U.S. arsenal, the nerve agents Sarin and
VX, by mixing them with caustic agents and burning the residue,
according to Soviet press reports.
   The U.S. Army used similar means to destroy mustard agents in
1974-75 but discarded the method because it left toxic waste, the
head of the American program, Gen. Walter L. Busbee, said in an
interview earlier this year.
   The sites in the United States where the government will destroy
its chemical weapons are in Maryland, Kentucky, Alabama, Utah,
Indiana, Oregon, Arkansas and Utah. The technology tested at
Johnston Atoll, to be used at other sites, burns the chemicals at
2,700 degrees, and filters the exhaust.

<HEAD>Rise in College Ethnic Attacks Partly Fault of Reagan Policies,
Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>

   One in five minority college students are the
victims of racial attacks, and former President Reagan's policies
are at least partly to blame, says a group that tracks such
incidents.
   Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg said, however, that ``cheap
political fingerpointing'' won't bring a solution to the problem.
   As many as 1 million college students are victims each year of
attacks that range from verbal slurs to physical assaults, officials
of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence said
Thursday.
   ``If we had an incidence of disease at 20 percent, the surgeon
general would have declared a public health crisis,'' Howard J.
Ehrlich, research director for the five-year-old group, said at a
news conference.
   Representatives of the group said attacks on homosexual students
appear to be even more frequent.
   Ehrlich said most college students came of ``political age''
during the Reagan presidency when ``civil rights were being devalued
in this society.''
   The report, ``Campus Ethnoviolence and the Policy Options,'' said
minority students at predominantly white campuses suffer almost
constant pressures because of their ethnic backgrounds.
   ``For most students, there are times when the classroom
atmosphere can be stressful. For the minority students, stress and
discomfort may be an everyday occurrence,'' the report said.
   Ehrlich said figures show that between 800,000 and 1 million
students are victimized each year. A quarter of those, he said, have
been harassed on more than one occasion.
   Former Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana, chairman of the
institute's board of directors, said Reagan did nothing during his
eight years in the White House to set a proper tone for racial
tolerance in the country.
   ``There was absolutely no leadership during the Reagan
administration to show this nation how it could be better,'' Bayh
said at the news conference. ``The president is supposed to stand up
and say, `We don't tolerate this in the United States of America.'''
   Bayh said what Reagan did do on civil rights was ``negative,''
such as the former president's push to dismantle the U.S. Civil
Rights Commission and his opposition to the extension of the Voting
Rights Act of 1964.
   Bayh said President Bush already has taken positive steps to deal
with the problem, such as inviting various groups to the signing
ceremony for the Hate Crimes Reporting Act. But Bush's term is too
new to assess his record on civil rights, Bayh added.
   While Bush has spoken against racial insensitivity, ``We'd like
to see more than words,'' Bayh said.
   Weinberg, reached by telephone in Los Angeles, discounted Bayh's
claims, saying, ``To Ronald Reagan there is no greater sin than
prejudice.
   ``Belief in the quality of all men and women has been at the very
core of his soul throughout his life. Those who think otherwise are
ignorant,'' Weinberg said.
   The spokesman said Reagan is ``very troubled by incidents of
racial bigotry on college campuses and elsewhere and believes the
solution will be found not by cheap political fingerpointing, but
through dialogue and sincere efforts to increase understanding.''

   Amy Dimak's favorite school subjects are math
and science but it was her skill with the alphabet that made her
champion of the 1990 National Spelling Bee.
   ``I wasn't too confident'' of winning, the 13-year-old Seattle
youngster said after the arduous two-day contest that ended Thursday
after 226 young spellers tackled 900 words.
   ``Some of the words I had to reach back on because I had
misspelled them before'' during practice, said Amy, who wore No. 218
_ the same as last year's winner.
   To win, Amy faced off with Eric Enders, 13, of El Paso, Texas,
correctly spelling ``fibranne,'' which means a type of cloth, after
Enders missed ``douanier,'' a customs officer.
   Amy, an eighth-grader, wins $5,000, a trophy and special prizes
from Encyclopaedia Britannica, a sponsor. Eric, who is in seventh
grader, will receive $4,000 for his second-place finish.
   Eric, who often asked for the definition and origin of the word
he was asked to spell, correctly spelled ``querimonious'' and
``valetudinary,'' while Amy succeeded with ``sansculotte'' and
``lanuginous.''
   At a news conference after her win, Amy said she knew all of the
11 words she had been asked to spell and didn't guess at any. But
when asked whether she was happy she didn't have to spell some of
the words given to other students, she replied, ``Definitely.''
   Amy, whose father is an electrical engineer at the Bremerton
shipyards near Seattle, said she had been studying with a spelling
coach for more than a year. In recent months, she devoted about two
hours a day three times a week to those studies, she said.
   Amy said the subjects she enjoys most in school are science and
math. She said that she wants to be a teacher, and she urged young
people to ``get a good education for later use in life.''
   A total of $26,550 in cash prizes will be awarded by program
sponsors Scripps Howard and 208 other daily, weekly and Sunday
newspapers.
   In all, 127 girls and 99 boys competed in this year's bee. They
came from 47 states, including Alaska and Hawaii, as well as the
District of Columbia, Guam, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands
and Department of Defense schools.
   By noon, only 65 super-spellers remained.
   Patrick Hearon, 12, of Hickory, N.C., slapped hands in a ``high
five'' sign with Michael Menninger, 14, of Stuart, Fla., when
Menninger correctly spelled ``caducicorn,'' which means having horns
that shed periodically, such as a deer.
   But Hearon later fell by the wayside on ``caulescent'' _ a
botanical term for a plant that has a stem above the ground.
   Dinah Edemeka, 13, of the Brooklyn section of New York City,
stopped in the middle of spelling ``mausoleum'' to shriek ``Oh, my
God! Oh, my God!'' as she realized her spelling error.
   After completion of the fourth round, almost two-thirds of the
spellers had been eliminated. Ninety youths were eliminated in the
fourth round alone.
   ``Take a deep breath,'' Judge Leroy Dillard suggested to William
Aston, 13, an eighth grader from Jackson, Tenn., as the youngster
struggled with the word ``hamartia.''
   He did and spelled it correctly to advance to the next round.

   Soviets are being bombarded with pictures of
adoring Westerners greeting Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a painful reminder
of the contrast between their president's success abroad and his
failure to improve life at home.
   Images of Gorbachev and his stylishly dressed wife in the land of
plenty are flooding newspapers and television screens back home in
the land of empty shelves.
   The trip contrasts his enormous popularity abroad, where he wins
praise for loosening up his society and helping end the Cold War, to
his sagging popularity here.
   Soviets are disappointed that after five years of rule, Gorbachev
hasn't improved their housing and food. There is an impression crime
and pollution are getting worse.
   Some Soviet politicians are urging Gorbachev to get his own house
in order before cutting trade and arms deals with the West.
   ``What happens depends not on negotiations in Washington but what
happens here,'' legislator Yuri Boldyrev said in an interview
Thursday.
   The Gorbachevs have been all over Soviet television: live special
broadcasts of his welcoming ceremony speech at the White House,
regular newscasts devoted entirely to his trip, reports on his wife,
Raisa, visiting a museum in Canada.
   The president has been criticized for living the high life during
previous visits abroad, such as his trip to Italy and Malta last
December to meet with Pope John Paul II and President Bush.
   Soviet TV correspondent Alexander Tikhomirov described his
countrymen's irritation when they saw Gorbachev in the Rome sun with
``snow-white sultans in guard's helmets.''
   ``Imagine: our people sitting before their television sets and
drinking tea, plain because they have run out of ration coupons for
sugar, again experiencing for a day all the unsettled state and
poverty of our lives,'' Tikhomirov said in an interview published
last week in the weekly magazine Ogonyok.
   The contrast could not be sharper: The land of sleek cars and
brightly clothed people, and the harsh Soviet reality of bare store
shelves, rationing of sugar and other items and impending major
price hikes.
   Gorbachev left for the United States and Canada a few days after
the government announced a plan to try to improve the country's
economy by switching from a centrally controlled system to a partial
market system, described by Soviet officials as a ``regulated
market.''
   The plan has come under fire from shoppers and politicians alike
for sharply raising food prices without introducing full market
reforms. People showed the government how they felt by buying out
the stores before the price hike.
   By going abroad, Gorbachev escapes some of the heat over the
economic reform plan. He also takes a breather from other domestic
headaches that seem to defy his control: the rise to power of his
political nemesis, Boris N. Yeltsin, who on Tuesday was elected
president of the Russian republic; the independence campaigns of the
Baltic republics; and ethnic violence in Armenia.
   He can focus on one area in which he has firm control, proven
success and enjoys consensus among Soviets: foreign policy issues
such as arms control, the search for peace in regional conflicts,
and expansion of trade with the West.
   Seeing their leader with Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney also reminds Soviets that their country has earned a
respected place in the community of nations, thanks largely to
Gorbachev.
   But it also risks giving his people another painful look at how
far their country lags behind the West in the basics.
   Most Soviets may never have the chance to sample the good life in
the West because of restrictions on foreign travel, and now they are
seeing it on television.
   Conservatives have implied that Gorbachev sometimes puts personal
ambition above the needs of his country.
   Last December, after his return from Italy and a summit with Bush
on Malta, a conservative Communist Party official reportedly scolded
Gorbachev at a closed-door Central Committee meeting: ``Is it a
proper thing to go bowing to the capitalists? To go asking for a
blessing from the pope?''
   Perhaps to make sure the conservatives don't try to make a power
play during his absence, Gorbachev took what one Western analyst
called an unprecedented move and left behind in Moscow his closest
Politburo ally, Alexander Yakovlev.
   The analyst, Dmitri Simes, said that despite the foreign policy
emphasis at the summit, Gorbachev's domestic problems cannot be far
from his mind.
   ``Even while in Washington, his thoughts are going to be in
Moscow,'' said Simes, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace.
   Reminders of his domestic woes were evident in Ottawa, where
protesters outside the Soviet Embassy chanted, ``Stop Killing
Armenians!'' Another group carried signs reading, ``No Tanks in
Lithuania.''
   Hundreds of other protesters tried to press their messages on him
in Washington.
   State-run TV has let Soviets know Gorbachev has been unable to
escape his domestic woes. On Wednesday, at least twice it broadcast
for several minutes his response to reporters' questions in Ottawa
about Yeltsin's election.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is satisfied Air
Force officials didn't try to mislead him when he wasn't told for
months that a F-117A Stealth fighter missed its original target
during the Panama invasion, his spokesman says.
   The glitch in communications left the Pentagon chief praising the
futuristic aircraft's ``pinpoint accuracy'' in the wake of the
Panama invasion, but ignorant of the plane's exact movements.
   Cheney demanded an explanation from the Air Force following
reports that one of the two planes that dropped 2,000-pound bombs in
a raid had actually hit a hillside some distance from the intended
target.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday that Cheney has
received a report on the matter from Air Force Inspector General Lt.
Gen. Bradley Hosmer.
   After getting the results of Bradley's investigation, Cheney ``is
satisfied there was no intent to withhold information or mislead
him,'' Williams said.
   ``He finds the Air Force explanation credible and he considers
the matter closed,'' the spokesman added. ``The Air Force is
recommending changes to fix the problem.''
   Cheney didn't receive a full report about the F-117A's
performance during the Dec. 20 operation until April 3.
   During ``Operation Just Cause'' in Panama, the pilots of two
F-117As were told to each drop a 2,000-pound bomb no closer than 50
meters away from two separate Panamanian Defense Forces barracks
buildings with the intent of stunning and disorienting the
Panamanian forces.
   But due to a last-minute misunderstanding between the pilots, one
F-117A pilot dropped his bomb near one of the barracks while the
other dropped his bomb on a hillside several hundred yards away.
   After this became known through news reports in April, Cheney
told top Air Force officials he wanted an explanation for why he was
not told one of the bombs hit a hillside.
   The confusion was found to have taken place between those in the
Air Force's chain of command charged with administration of the
aircraft and those in the service's upper chain of command, Williams
said.
   Air Force officials responsible for the administration of the
aircraft reported that both jets had accomplished their mission,
which was to stun and disorient the Panamanian troops.
   Even though the misunderstanding between the pilots resulted in
one of the bombs hitting a hillside, the bomb nevertheless hit where
the pilot had aimed it. Therefore, the officials in charge of the
plane judged its mission was fulfilled because the Panamanians were
stunned by the loud noise created by the explosion, Williams said.
   This was reported up the operational chain of command, which left
Cheney and Air Force leaders with the impression that both planes
hit the bulls-eye.
   Asked if he could say exactly where the breakdown of
communication occurred, Williams said he was not privy to that
information.
   The Air Force, asked to comment on Williams' remarks, said no
statement was immediately available.

<HEAD>Inspector General Praises Kemp But Says Many Management Problems
Linger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary Jack Kemp is encouraging reforms at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but losses and
waste in housing programs continue because of longstanding
management woes, the agency's inspector general says.
   Inspector General Paul A. Adams said Thursday many of HUD's
internal accounting and oversight systems remain troubled 15 months
after a report by Adams sparked exhaustive reviews of Reagan-era
mismanagement and favoritism at HUD.
   Kemp, who inherited the mess, has cooperated with HUD auditors
who have uncovered mismanagement and waste, and he has pushed
numerous reform ideas of his own, Adams said.
   ``I find this refreshing,'' Adams' report said.
   But in his semiannual report to Congress, Adams said the legacy
of longstanding mismanagement is that virtually all of the
department's major programs are plagued by questionable spending and
are difficult to monitor because of poor internal accounting and
management controls.
   For example, he said originations of HUD-backed loans are ``still
susceptible to fraud and mismanagement because of ineffective
departmental policies and systems. ... Our audits and investigations
indicate that individuals and companies across the nation continue
to improperly originate loans for personal gain.''
   In the last six months, Adams said, five lenders have been
referred to a HUD panel for sanctions because of improper loan
activity.
   Major problems also remain in HUD's Section 8 assistance program
because of management problems, he said.
   ``HUD does not have long-range plans for the Section 8 program,''
Adams wrote. ``As a result, it can neither plan or budget
effectively for its programs, systems and procedures for future
years.''
   Some of the reforms enacted by Kemp and Congress are not taking
hold because of slow and inefficient implementation at some HUD
field offices, Adams said.
   He also recommended using HUD staff instead of outside
contractors for many of the evaluations and testing of HUD
management controls initiated by Kemp.
   Adams asked Congress to expand the staff of his office, saying
his staff spends much of its time working with U.S. attorneys, the
FBI and other law enforcement agencies conducting investigations
based on his office's audit and investigative work.
   Since an Adams report on a HUD rehabilitation program issued in
April 1989 detailed poor management and political favoritism at the
department, HUD has been the subject of intense media and
congressional scrutiny. A special prosecutor is investigating former
HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and several former top Pierce
deputies.
   As of March 31, Adams said his office had 1,751 investigative
cases in the pipeline. During the six months covered by the report _
October 1989 through March 1990 _ Adams said his office referred 238
cases to law enforcement authorities for possible prosecution.

<HEAD>Researchers Clone Monkey AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have taken a step they think could
help them better understand AIDS, using a cloned virus to infect
monkeys with an AIDS-like disease.
   This is the first time a laboratory-developed virus has been used
to cause an AIDS-type infection, the researchers reported in a paper
published today in the journal Science.
   ``The importance of this is that we can now ... make very precise
changes (in the virus) and try and predict what will happen,''
explained Harry Kestler of Harvard University's New England Regional
Primate Research Center.
   Because all copies of a cloned virus are identical, scientists
can compare the results of an infection with the original virus with
infections from a virus in which they have made specific changes.
   And, since the virus used in this experiment is a close relative
of the one that causes AIDS in people, the affect on the monkeys may
help doctors better understand the human disease, the researchers
say.
   Teams at Harvard and the University of California at Davis used a
cloned simian immunodeficiency virus, the closest known relative of
the human AIDS virus, to infect the monkeys.
   While the mixture of viruses found in infected animals has been
used to induce the disease in the past, this is the first time it
has been done with a cloned version, Kestler explained.
   In cloning a virus scientists make an exact copy of it. This
allows them to understand the exact characteristics of the virus
they are working with and to make specific changes in the virus for
experiments, Kestler said.
   Many of the monkeys infected with the cloned virus developed a
fast-acting form of AIDS, according to the report.
   The fast-acting disease occurs in monkeys that fail to develop an
antibody response to the infection, and these die in about six
months, Kestler explained.
   Other monkeys do develop an antibody response and seem to live
longer, he said. The researchers assume that those animals will
eventually develop a more lingering form of AIDS, Kestler said, but
they must wait to see what happens.
   ``This is sort of a progress report on an ongoing study that is
going to take a couple of years to complete,'' he observed.
   The monkeys that become ill develop ``all the hallmarks'' of
AIDS, said Kestler, such as weight loss and a variety of
opportunistic infections when their immune system weakens.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections.
   The incurable condition is believed to be caused by an unusual
virus, now called human immunodeficiency virus or HIV, which is
spread through contact with blood or semen from infected people.
   The chief victims of AIDS have been homosexual men and
intravenous drug abusers.
   Some people have become infected through blood transfusions,
although blood supplies are more closely screened now. Health
officials estimate that heterosexual contact is responsible for 4
percent of cases and that between 1 million and 1.5 million
Americans have been exposed to the virus.
   As of April 30, 1990, AIDS had been diagnosed in 132,510
Americans, of whom 61 percent, or 80,799, have died since June 1,
1981, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control. No one
is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   The World Health Organization said that as of April 30, 1990,
there have been 254,078 cases reported from 151 countries. The
Global Programme on AIDS, an agency of the World Health
Organization, estimates that the actual number of AIDS cases in the
world is more than 500,000 and that there will be at least 1 million
new cases worldwide by 1993.

toward a new relationship.''
   ``The agreements we've reached cannot cause us to lose sight of
some of the differences that remain. Lithuania is one such issue.''
   ``... the success of this summit depends not on the agreements we
will sign but on our efforts to lay the groundwork for overcoming
decades of division and discord, to build a world of peace in
freedom.''
   ``... whatever deep differences divided us in the past, the
United States and the American people approach every issue with a
sincere belief that our two nations can find common ground. Indeed,
because of our unique positions in the world _ we must find common
ground.''

   Gorbachev:
   ``It is not here that the German question will be resolved.''
   ``I cannot say yet how we are going to conclude this meeting,
what the results will be. That would be premature.'' But based on
the talks Thursday, he said it was ``possible to expect major
results from this meeting.''
   ``The walls, which for years separated the peoples, are
collapsing.''
   ``The trenches of the Cold War are disappearing. The fog of
prejudice, mistrust and animosity is vanishing. ... This generation
of people on Earth may witness the advent of an irreversible period
of peace in the history of civilization.''
   ``Americans know pretty well what a market is and about the whole
intricacies of a market, but we are innocent, so to say. ... As far
as a market is concerned, we have to start from scratch.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archibald Roosevelt Jr., a grandson of
President Theodore Roosevelt and a retired CIA officer, died
Thursday of congestive heart failure at his home. He was 72.
   Roosevelt served as CIA station chief in Istanbul, Madrid and
London before retiring from the agency in 1974. He then became vice
president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, based in Washington.
   He was active in diplomatic circles during the Reagan
administration, when his wife, Selwa Showker Roosevelt, was chief of
protocol at the State Department.
   Roosevelt was born to high social position in Boston, graduating
from Harvard College in 1940 in the same class as President Kennedy.
He won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University but he was unable
to take it because of World War II.
   An Army intelligence officer in the war, he joined the Central
Intelligence Group, the immediate predecessor of the CIA, in 1947
and served for 27 years, always under diplomatic cover.
   Some have written that he had a hand in various coups of the
early 1950s, notably the overthrows of King Farouk in Egypt and
nationalist Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.
   But Roosevelt was the soul of discretion in his 1988 memoirs,
``For Lust of Knowing: Memoirs of an Intelligence Officer.''
   In it, he did not even list his duty stations _ but he did tip
off an interviewer to check his Who's Who entry to figure them out.
   Roosevelt confessed a fascination with the Middle East and
languages, learning about 20, including Uzbek.
   The intelligence officer ``must not only know whose side he is
on, but have a deep conviction that he is on the right side. He
should not imitate the cynical protagonists of John LeCarre's
novels, essentially craftsmen who find their side no less amoral
than the other,'' Roosevelt once wrote.
   Besides his wife, he is survived by a son by a first marriage
that ended in divorce, and two grandchildren.

   A federal appeals court issued a stay
late Thursday just 90 minutes before the scheduled execution of a
condemned killer who had wanted no further appeals.
   Thomas Baal, 26, had been scheduled to be put to death by lethal
injection at 12:05 a.m. PDT Friday for stabbing a bus driver to
death in Las Vegas.
   The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled 2-1 that the
execution should be stayed until noon Saturday to get more
information from U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben, who earlier
ruled against a stay. Justice Alex Kozinski dissented.
   Baal's parents had petitioned McKibben for the stay, citing their
son's long-term mental problems and possible brain damage. As his
parents listened, Baal told the court, ``I just want to go die and
be free. That's all.''
   Justice Harry Pregerson questioned whether Baal's competency
hearing had properly focused on whether he could make a rational
decision to give up his appeal rights if he was suffering from a
brain disorder, disease or defect.
   ``We're doing everything here on the run,'' said Pregerson.
   Baal had told McKibben he didn't want anybody to appeal on his
behalf, including his parents. Edwin and Doris Baal traveled from
Mesa, Colo., to see their son before his execution.
   Asked if he had any other requests, Baal said, ``Bring me a
hooker.'' The judge said he couldn't grant that, and asked if he had
any others. Baal replied, ``Just my last meal and get the ball
rolling, man.''
   McKibben ruled that on the basis of Baal's comments it's clear
``he does not want to stop the execution. The court finds that he is
competent to make that decision.''
   The hearing was held to review an 11th-hour petition filed by
Assistant U.S. Defender Pat Flanagan on behalf of Baal's parents.
   Flanagan sought to intervene on what's known as a ``next friend''
basis, a tactic often rejected by courts. But the U.S. Supreme
Court, in an April 24 decision rejecting an Arkansas death row
inmate's ``next friend'' status for another condemned convict in
that state, spelled out conditions that could allow such petitions.
   They include mental incapacity or other disability that prevents
a condemned person from pursuing an appeal.
   Baal, a former mental patient, smashed a television set in his
cell Tuesday. He was described as quiet Thursday.
   Prison spokesman Glen Wharton said Baal was spending much of his
time making phone calls.
   Baal was sentenced to die for stabbing bus driver Frances Maves
to death in 1988 as she resisted his robbery attempt.
   His execution would be Nevada's fifth and the 129th nationally
since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume
use of the death penalty.
   Nevada's last executions were in June 1989. In the same week,
confessed murderers Sean Flanagan and William ``Bud'' Thompson were
given lethal injections after both said they wanted no further
appeals.

   Here are some facts and figures on Liberia:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND: Lying between Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone, the
West African nation of Liberia covers 37,743 square miles. The
coastal plain gives way to rocky cliffs, and strong tides make
access to the Atlantic Ocean difficult. The highest elevations are
in the northern highlands, which rise up to 4,500 feet. The capital
is Monrovia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE: The population is estimated at more than 2.5 million,
including 16 principal tribal groups and about 50,000 descendants of
freed American slaves who founded the country. English is the
official language. The vast majority of the country practices
traditional African religions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY: Even before a 5-month-old guerrilla war began, the
economy was near collapse, though the country possesses some of the
richest iron ore in the world. Liberia has been unable to pay its
foreign debt, and it has been suspended by the International
Monetary Fund. Though the currency is tied to the U.S. dollar,
little money is in circulation, driving up prices and increasing the
value of the few dollars available. Though mining earns more than 64
percent of Liberia's foreign exchange, agricultural remains the main
employer.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE HISTORY: In 1822, freed American slaves visited Liberia and
began settlements. They declared Liberia an independent republic in
1847. Descendants of the freed slaves, called Americo-Liberians,
dominated the country until then-Master Sgt. Samuel Doe led a
military coup on April 12, 1979. He was popular with the majority of
Liberians, who resented the dominance of the Americo-Liberians. Doe
headed a military government until October 1985, when elections were
held. He claimed a victory, but opposition parties and independent
observers said the vote was rigged. On Dec. 24, 1989, former Doe
aide Charles Taylor invaded with a small band of men from Ivory
Coast. Taylor said he intended to topple Doe's government.

<TEXT>
   The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season
begins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East and
Gulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a new
era of destructive storms.
   The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by a
tropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavy
rain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into a
hurricane.
   Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are
ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center.
   A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report
predicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine to
Texas will grow 60 percent, counting from 1960 until 2010. Some
states such as Florida and Texas will experience near 200 percent
growth during the period, the report said.
   ``What we're looking at is the possibility of greater destruction
and greater loss of life,'' Sheets said Thursday. ``We can't stop
the hurricanes. The only thing we can do is work on better
preparedness and emergency planning.''
   The aftermath from Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 and Hugo last year
taught officials what improvements are needed to better evacuate and
protect the estimated 45 million coastal residents from Maine to
Texas, Sheets said.
   ``If the long-term trends are any indication of what's to come,
we are in for more frequent and stronger hurricanes,'' said Sheets.
   Gilbert killed more than 300 people and caused heavy damage from
the Lesser Antilles to Mexico. Hugo killed 28 people in the eastern
Caribbean and 29 more in South Carolina and caused a record $10
billion in damage.
   Sheets said the predictions of increased hurricane activity are
based on studies of past decades, atmospheric low-pressure waves and
increased rainfall trends in West Africa, near the breeding waters
for most hurricanes.
   Hurricane activity started dropping after drought conditions
began in the early 1960s in Africa's Sahel region, he said.
   Between 1940 and 1969, the United States was hit by 22 hurricanes
with minimum winds of 110 mph. From 1970 to 1989, there were only
eight such storms, including Hugo, Sheets said.
   ``I hope we don't catch up this year with the decade of the
'40s,'' he said.
   There are five categories of hurricanes, ranging from Category 1,
which has top sustained winds of 74 mph to 95 mph, to Category 5,
with top winds greater then 155 mph.
   Both Gilbert and Hugo reached category 5, according to
meteorologist Barry Fatchwell of the National Hurricane Center.
   Sheets praised most South Carolina officials' response to Hugo,
but said some leaders ``didn't have their proverbial act together''
and lives may have been saved.
   Also, he said Hugo showed inadequacies in the Emergency Broadcast
System and some communities used emergency shelters ill-suited to
withstand a powerful hurricane.
   In the Caribbean, officials have worked to improve communications
systems after links were cut by Gilbert.

   The United States has a flotilla of warships

evacuate thousands of Americans who might become trapped by an armed
rebellion there.
   The six warships carrying more than 2,000 Marines were ordered to
remain on station in international waters off the Liberian coast,
the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The number of Americans in Liberia has been declining. Several
weeks ago, the State Department said 10,000 people, including
American citizens and others holding claim to U.S. protection, were
in the country. That figure later was pared back to around 6,000,
and the department now estimates, because some have left already,
that 1,100 people could be eligible for evacuation.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed in a rebellion against
the rule of Liberian President Samuel Doe during the last five
months.
   The State Department on Thursday advised all U.S. citizens to
leave the African country immediately.
   The U.S. flotilla includes a destroyer, an amphibious assault
ship, a tank landing ship and other support vessels carrying
ammunition and combat supplies, said Cmdr. David Thomas, a spokesman
for the Defense Department.
   Also aboard are 179 Marine officers and 2,102 enlisted men,
Thomas said.
   Rebel troops moved to within 25 miles of the Liberian capital,
Monrovia, on Thursday and there was concern that fighting in the
city could raise the death toll dramatically.
   The State Department, in a travel advisory, warned that
conditions in the country were deteriorating.
   All non-essential U.S. personnel and all dependents were ordered
to depart. Americans in the country needing assistance were advised
to contact the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia.
   The U.S. ships are under orders to ``be prepared to evacuate
American citizens in the event that they would no longer be able to
leave the country by commercial means,'' Thomas said.
   The probability of using military force to evacuate Americans is
low and the ships are being stationed off the Liberian coast as a
precaution, Thomas said.
   The ships in the U.S. force are the USS Sipan, an amphibious
assault ship; the USS Ponce, an amphibious transport dock ship; the
USS Sumter, a tank landing ship; the USS Concord, a combat stores
ship; the USS Suribachi, an ammunition ship; and the USS Peterson, a
destroyer.

   Reports of his death have been greatly
exaggerated.
   Not Elvis, but close; the King's friend James Kingsley, a
longtime reporter for The Commercial Appeal.
   In ``E Is For Elvis,'' the new guide to the king of rock and
roll, there is a premature announcement of Kingsley's death _ by
suicide.
   ``I was shocked,'' said Kingsley. ``I didn't know what to think.''
   According to the book, ``James Kingsley, a friend of Elvis
Presley who had grown up in the same North Memphis neighborhood as
the star, was a reporter for the Memphis Commercial Appeal.
   ``Kingsley wrote about Elvis frequently and broke many news
stories concerning his activities. On Feb. 22, 1989, Kingsley died
of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.''
   The person who actually died of a gunshot wound on that date was
another James Kingsley, 51, who was a friend of Elvis' and movie
stuntman.
   The reporter Kingsley said he did not grow up in Memphis, but his
family and the Presleys knew each other in Tupelo, Miss.
   The two Kingsleys were not related.
   Kevin Mulroy, an editor for the publisher New American Library,
said Wednesday he was trying to contact one of the authors to find
out what went wrong.

<HEAD>NAACP Settles Fee Case With Former Attorneys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NAACP has agreed to drop a lawsuit against
former staff attorneys who it alleged illegally kept more than $2
million in fees.
   A statement issued by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People on Thursday said an agreement was
reached with former NAACP general counsel Nathaniel Jones, who is
now a judge on the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The statement gave no details on the disposition of the fees.
   NAACP President Benjamin Hooks said the dispute was ``an honest
difference of opinion as to how these fees should be distributed.''
   A lawsuit pending in Cleveland was being dismissed as part of the
agreement, the statement said. Others besides Jones were parties to
the case, but the statement did not mention them and the NAACP
office did not answer a telephone call seeking clarification.
   The legal fees resulted from five discrimination cases dating to
1970.

<HEAD>NYNEX Indicted for Business Practices of Tennessee Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regional telephone giant NYNEX Corp. has been
indicted for allegedly violating the 1982 court order that broke up
the old Bell system.
   The New York City-based telephone giant was indicted Thursday on
one count of criminal contempt of court for allegedly providing
information services to customers in violation of the 1982 consent
decree.
   NYNEX denied any wrongdoing.
   The indictment is likely to provide ammunition to those opposing
efforts in Congress to lift some of the restrictions the 1982 decree
imposed on the regional Bell companies.
   The landmark 1982 ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene
prohibited the seven regional Bell holding companies from engaging
in certain types of business, including processing computerized data.
   The indictment, obtained by the Justice Department's antitrust
division, accused NYNEX through its Nashville, Tenn., subsidiary,
Telco Research Corp., of providing data processing and information
retrieval services over telephone lines from April 1986 to February
1987.
   The indictment did not cite possible penalties.
   Telco provided a computer and software to the long-distance
company, MCI Communications Corp., to help make MCI's network more
efficient, NYNEX spokesman Bob O'Brien said. He said Justice alleged
that NYNEX did not provide enough of the computer to MCI.
   Justice said NYNEX violated terms of the 1982 consent decree,
known as the Modification of Final Judgment, that prohibit NYNEX and
the other regional Bell companies from providing information
services.
   The consent decree was set up to divide different types of
communication services between American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
and the spinoff companies.
   ``Our position is that there was no violation of the MFJ,''
O'Brien said.

<HEAD>Minority Employment Up Slightly in Newsrooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A study says the number of minorities and women
working for daily newspapers grew slightly over the past two years
but both groups are still under-represented in the industry.
   A survey by the American Newspaper Publishers Association,
released Thursday, said minorities now account for 18 percent of the
newspaper industry's work force, while representing 22 percent of
the nation's total civilian work force.
   Women comprise 39 percent of newspaper staffs and 48 percent of
the total work force, the study said.
   Both categories, according to a survey taken this year, improved
their representation on newspaper staffs by 2 percentage points
since 1988.
   The survey said minorities are still dramatically
under-represented in newsrooms.
   Minorities make up 10 percent of news-editorial department
staffs, the same percentage as 1988, the study showed.

<HEAD>State Panel Says Analysis Would Have Shown Highway, Bridge Quake
Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of California highways and
bridges probably wouldn't withstand a major earthquake because of
outdated engineering standards, according to a long-awaited state
report.
   The report Thursday by the governor-appointed Board of Inquiry,
also concluded that officials should have known portions of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and Interstate 880 would collapse in
the Oct. 17 Loma Prieta earthquake. They didn't because the state
couldn't pay for an updated engineering study due to budget
constraints, the panel said.
   ``More aggressive efforts are needed if the disastrous potential
of future earthquakes is to be minimized and the public safety
adequately protected,'' said board Chairman George Housner, a
professor of engineering emeritus for the California Institute of
Technology.
   Engineering standards used to build I-880 and the Bay Bridge in
the 1930s and 1950s and other structures were adequate for
engineering knowledge at that time but seismic standards ``were very
low compared to those in use today,'' the report said.
   The Oct. 17 earthquake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, caused
an estimated $7 billion in damages and killed 67 people, including
42 in the freeway collapse.
   Crews took one month to repair a 50-foot stretch of the upper
deck of the Bay Bridge that crashed to the lower deck. The Cypress
viaduct remains closed.
   The panel said the double-deck Cypress structure collapsed
because it was built on soft soil and its upright support columns
and connecting joints weren't strong enough to hold up the upper
deck. The shaking literally pulled the structure apart, the report
said.
   Gov. George Deukmejian, who attended the Oakland meeting where
the 272-page report was released, said the report will help because
it tells state officials ``what we should do and how to go about
it.''
   Deukmejian said he hoped voters Tuesday would approve Proposition
111, which would increase the gasoline tax by 9 cents. Some of the
extra funds should be used to retrofit the state's highways and
bridges in line with report recommendations, he said.
   ``The Loma Prieta earthquake should be considered a clear and
powerful warning to the people of California,'' Housner said. ``We
have made progress during the last two decades in reducing
earthquake risks, but much more could have been done and awaits
doing.''

   And now, for the pooch who has everything:
designer togs for dogs.
   From New York's ritzy Park Avenue to Hollywood's walk of stars,
fashion mavens with leashes are swaddling their pets in Spandex
doggy swimsuits, denim jean jackets, Burberry raincoats, and fur
coats _ though the fur is fake; even such extravagance has limits.
   ``Everything from tuxedoes to sequined gowns can be had or
custom-made,'' said Mark Drendel, a pet pamperer at Canine Styles by
Ursual Lehnhardt, a New York salon.
   ``If a lady goes out to buy an expensive Chanel suit, I don't
think she would mind spending a little extra on her dog. In fact,
most of our clientele are very wealthy and they don't think twice
about it.''
   Karen Thompson, a New York fashion designer, is working on a fall
collection of wool dog sweaters mirroring the latest human fashions
gracing magazine covers.
   ``People are into eating right, looking good and staying healthy.
So naturally, it's not such a big thing anymore to want the same
things for their pets,'' she said.
   A dog wardrobe at Thompson's two New York shops begins at $150:
$60 for a hand-knit wool sweater and $90 for a ``Chanel-style'' lead
and collar made of hand-braided leather and gold.
   But Thompson said the price is worth the stunning fashion
statement of a well-dressed owner and matching pet.
   ``I really care about the pets that come in to my store,'' said
Thompson. ``I can dress them up and make them very pretty. It's fun
to take care of them and make them look good.''
   Even big retailers are getting into the act.
   The main Macy's department store in Manhattan is reporting brisk
sales at its year-old Petigree Shop, where a Burberry raincoat from
London is going fast at $120, Spandex doggy swimsuits for $12.
   It also offers fake furs, handpainted T-shirts, vinyl raincoats
in hot electric colors and tailored wool coats.
   Demand is big among the wealthy.
   Mary Jane Weiskopf of New York City said she has spent oodles to
make sure her outfits are canine-coordinated, but the effort has
earned her little Alice many fine compliments.
   ``I wear a lot Chanel suits and I put a lot of matching collars
to them. Tomorrow I'm wearing a red plaid Valentino jacket and Alice
will be wearing her red raincoat,'' Mrs. Weiskopf said.
   ``Alice is the most pampered dog in the world. She has wonderful
clothes,'' Mrs. Weiskopf said. ``She's gone from her Southwestern
mood to her Leopard mood to her Chanel mood _ and now she has close
to 20 sweaters.''
   Asked if Alice would ever go out without dressing, she chided the
reporter, ``If you're a proper lady, you don't go out without
looking your best.''
   In the dog-eat-dog world of Washington, D.C., Bone Jour Boutique
claims to cater to some truly top dogs. Among the very important
pooches: the first dog, Millie, and Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole's pet.
   ``Senator Dole's dog is a regular grooming client and Millie Bush
was in here for a photo session a year ago,'' said Bone Jour manager
Brian Bean, referring to the bouncy springer spaniel owned by
President Bush.
   Bean confided that Millie has received a pearl necklace from Bone
Jour, to match the trademark pearls worn by first lady Barbara Bush.
But any mutt, not just a presidential pooch, can look like a million.
   ``It's a whole new world; now you even have to decide what color
toenail polish your dog is going to wear,'' Bean said.
   ``We even have little tuxedoes and little satin gowns for dogs,''
he added. That would make a splash at Embassy Row parties.
   Pet Limo, based in Beverly Hills, will pick up a pooch in a white
stretch limousine, take it to its salon for grooming, dress-up in a
tuxedo or sequined dress and return it home in time for a big bash.
   ``New Year's Eve is one of our biggest nights,'' said Steve L.
May, the driving force behind Pet Limo.
   ``We've also done some black tie events and we once brought in 52
white doves, flowers and dressed the dogs up in little ouftfits for
a wedding shower.''
   Limo rental averages between $45 and $55, grooming $20-$45 and a
tuxedo another $20.
   May said some big-name Hollywood stars are among his clients.
   ``I'd love to tell you their names but I can't,'' he said.

<HEAD>Insurance Company Retiree: Thanks But No Thanks for Lunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERICH SMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Genevieve McLaughlin told her boss at
Independence Blue Cross she wanted to skip the traditional
retirement lunch so the money could be spent on charity, she got a
typical corporate response.
   The company set up a committee.
   Blue Cross usually throws a retirement lunch at a fancy hotel for
employees of a decade or more, complete with flowers, photographs
and a $100 gift certificate. The guest of honor can invite up to 35
co-workers, and a handful of managers attend.
   The non-profit health insurance company, with about 2 million
subscribers in the Philadelphia area, picks up the $1,200 tab up to
20 times a year, but Mrs. McLaughlin, 64, wasn't interested in
sitting through a bunch of speeches by executives she hardly knows.
   ``You ride the elevator with these people and they don't have the
faintest idea who you are,'' she said.
   Mrs. McLaughlin suggested to her boss that instead of spending
the money on a lunch she didn't want, the company split it between
her favorite charities _ St. John's Hospice and her grandson's
Little League team.
   ``They gave me a memo saying they'd set up a committee to
consider whether or not the rules could be changed,'' she said.
   Mrs. McLaughlin's retirement as a Medicaid claims adjuster
officially starts today after nearly 19 years with the company. She
doesn't know when the committee decision will be announced.
   Meanwhile, Blue Cross gave her a choice _ have the lunch or wait
for the committee decision.
   ``They said it might be five years from now. And who knows if I'm
even going to be around tomorrow?'' Mrs. McLaughlin said. ``But I
don't care, I want that money to go to that hospice and that Little
League team.
   ``After all, it's not like I'm saying, `Just give me the money so
I can go down to the shore.'''
   Blue Cross spokesman Dick Mendenhall said the decision has been
put on hold. He didn't know of any other employees who made similar
requests.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she sympathizes with the company in one
respect.
   ``I understand part of their problem. They're worried that some
day, some one retiring will want to donate the money to the Ku Klux
Klan or a group like that,'' she said. ``Well, why don't they just
specify that you can't donate the money to something destructive?''
   Bob Cantlin, a company vice president, bristled at the suggestion
Blue Cross could be a little quicker about making a decision.
   ``I think, quite frankly, some companies would just say, `This is
the policy and we won't consider changing,''' he said.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she feels bad about the controversy, but she
isn't backing down.
   ``If a big outfit like Blue Cross would change their policy like
this, maybe other companies would follow suit and there'd be a
little less hunger in the world,'' she said.

<HEAD>Interior Considers Captive Breeding of Owls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IDAHO FALLS, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Interior Department may advocate
the captive breeding of spotted owls to save the threatened species
while allowing the cutting of old-growth forests where the owls
live, an official said.
   ``President Bush has told the Interior secretary that we've got
to save the owl and we've got to save jobs,'' said Jim Hughes,
deputy assistant Interior secretary for lands and minerals. ``Our
mission is to make them compatible.''
   Hughes, who accompanied Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan on a
visit to Idaho that ended Thursday, said the department was not
committed to the captive-breeding idea.
   ``It's something we're looking at,'' he said.
   Bill Burnham, director of The Peregrine Fund and the World Center
for Birds of Prey, which Lujan visited Wednesday, said he would be
glad to cooperate in an experiment to see if spotted owls will breed
in captivity.
   ``Typically, owls are easier to breed than falcons,'' Burnham
said.
   But he was careful to note that the issue of logging uncut
forests is likely to remain even if captive breeding could save owls.
   ``The Peregrine Fund is interested in the conservation of the owl
as a way to preserve the species,'' he said. ``Whether to cut or not
cut the old-growth forests is another issue.''
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to decide in late
June whether to list the spotted owl as an endangered species. If it
is listed, the timber industry says hundreds of loggers, millworkers
and others could lose their jobs because timber cuts would be
sharply curtailed.
   An estimated 3,000 to 5,000 spotted owls remain in the old-growth
forests of the Pacific Northwest.
   Burnham said he expects both environmentalists and timber workers
to be skeptical of captive breeding.
   ``The problem with the owl is not the owl,'' he said. ``The main
issue is overcutting of old-growth forests. The environmental
community is probably not interested in the captive breeding of owls
because then they lose their argument for saving the forests.
   ``And the timber industry won't be interested either, because
then that would mean they're admitting that logging has hurt the
owls.''
   Joe Hinson, executive director of the Coeur d'Alene-based
Intermountain Forest Industries Association, agreed with Burnham's
assessment.
   ``The environmental groups have made it clear the owl is just a
surrogate to the eliminating of harvest of old-growth stands of
timber in the Pacific Northwest,'' he said.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo will invite
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to visit South Korea when the
two meet next week, newspapers said today. A North Korean official
denounced the planned meeting.
   Several Seoul newspapers quoted high-ranking government sources
as saying Gorbachev will be invited to visit Korea after his trip to
Japan, planned for next April.
   The Roh-Gorbachev meeting Monday will be the first between
leaders of the two countries, which have no diplomatic ties. The
Soviet Union is a close ally of Seoul's rival, communist North
Korea, to which it provides arms.
   North Korea's official news agency today quoted a Foreign
Ministry official as denouncing the planned meeting between Roh and
Gorbachev.
   ``If President Gorbachev has a meeting with Roh Tae-woo, which we
do not think will take place, it will be a serious political
issue,'' the official was quoted as saying.
   The report by the Korean Central News Agency was monitored in
Tokyo.
   ``We consider that the president of the Soviet Union, an ally of
ours, is quite able to analyze and judge what a serious political
consequence will be entailed by his meeting with Roh Tae-woo, who is
seeking only the split of Korea,'' the report said.
   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
capitalist South at the end of World War II in 1945. The two sides
fought the Korean War in 1950-53.
   A South Korean official said today that the agenda for the
Roh-Gorbachev talks will include the normalization of relations
between Seoul and Moscow, economic cooperation and peace measures on
the divided Korean peninsula.
   Kim Kim Chong-hwi, presidential assistant for foreign affairs,
expressed optimism about the chances for formal relations. ``The
meeting itself shows that the Soviet Union recognizes the Republic
of (South) Korea,'' he was quoted as telling the Dong-A Ilbo
newspaper.
   Dong-A Ilbo said Roh and Gorbachev are expected to agree on an
early establishment of diplomatic ties, possibly before September.
   Seoul officials hope the Roh-Gorbachev meeting will help ease
tension on the peninsula. They believe improved ties with the Soviet
Union will result in better relations between the two Koreas.

   A man set himself on fire in front of the U.S.
Consulate in Shanghai this morning, the U.S. Embassy said. Shanghai
officials said the man, who suffered serious burns, was a mentally
ill Chinese worker.
   Embassy press officer Sheridan Bell said Chinese bystanders
reported that the man, who appeared to be in his 30s, doused himself
with gasoline and lit a match.
   Chinese guards put out the blaze with fire extinguishers and the
man, who appeared badly burned but still alive, was quickly taken
away in a police car.
   Bell said the man said nothing and carried no sign or letter to
explain his act. No embassy personnel witnessed the incident.
   An official in the Shanghai Foreign Affairs Office said the man
suffered from mental illness. He said the man, now hospitalized, was
a worker but that his name, age and employer were not known.
   Most of the 50 to 100 Chinese outside the consulate at the time
of the incident were waiting to file visa applications, but it was
not known if the man was also seeking a U.S. Visa.
   Thousands of young Chinese, seeking to escape political
repression or poor job opportunities at home, are trying to gain
entry to the United States and other Western countries. Many who
lack proper qualifications are rejected.
   In the past year there have been protests outside the Australian
and Japanese consulates in Shanghai by people unhappy over strict
new regulations on student visas.

<HEAD>47-Pound Tumor Removed From Miner's Abdomen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 47-pound tumor was removed from a Pennsylvania
coal miner's abdomen following unsuccessful attempts to reduce the
cancerous growth through chemotherapy, hospital officials said.
   The tumor was removed from Richard Moody, 47, in a five-hour
operation Wednesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
   ``He's still in shock that it's gone,'' Moody's wife, Lilly, said
Thursday. ``He's suffered so much in the last few months, and he's
still in a daze knowing that it's out of there.''
   The tumor had filled Moody's abdominal cavity and crowded his
digestive tract, making it impossible for him to eat normally and
leaving him bed-ridden for the last several weeks, she said.
   The tumor was described as a schwannoma sarcoma, a slow-spreading
growth that originated in nerves near Moody's right kidney. Surgeons
had to remove one kidney along with the tumor, hospital officials
said.
   Moody was in stable condition, hospital spokeswoman Carol Pearson
said. Lab results should indicate in a few days whether cancer had
spread to other parts of his body. Moody's weight dropped to 130
pounds following surgery, she said.
   Without surgery, the tumor would have killed him within a few
weeks because of the progressive crowding of his organs, Pearson
said.
   A spokeswoman for Dr. John Niederhuber said it was the largest
tumor he had seen in 20 years of surgery.
   Moody, of Uniontown, Pa., first had sought to have the growth
removed in March 1989, but a West Virginia surgeon said it was too
large to be removed.

   Hundreds of riot police stormed the
headquarters of an insurance company today to break up a sit-in
strike by workers demanding wage hikes. No injuries were reported.
   Shortly after midnight, about 800 riot police moved into the
downtown Seoul headquarters of the Daehan Education Insurance Co.,
where about 1,000 union members were in the ninth day of their
strike.
   Police took away 212 union activists who had led the sit-in
protests, but no clashes were reported. Police said all but three of
the detained protesters would be released.
   The strike began last Wednesday when the company rejected
workers' demands for a 15 percent increase in their basic monthly
salaries. Workers have staged sit-down protests in the lobby and
third-floor offices.
   South Korea has been rocked by labor unrest in recent months, and
the government has vowed to deal firmly with the strikers, saying
the fate of the country's slumping economy is at stake.

   An anonymous letter from a person claiming
to be ``the Lord's avenger'' has complicated the investigation of
two pipe bomb explosions that damaged a lumber mill and injured two
environmentalists.
   The letter writer claimed to have set both pipe bombs.
   ``It could be serious; it could be a prank,'' FBI special agent
Barry Mawn told a news conference Thursday. Anybody could have sent
the letter, Mawn said, but the writer ``had a very good knowledge of
explosives.''
   The new evidence has unsettled Earth First!, the anti-logging
group that says members Darryl Cherney and Judi Bari were the
targets of one of the bombs. Police allege they were carrying the
device in their car when it blew up on them May 24 in Oakland.
   ``Sure, maybe there's a religious wacko out there who's
interested in killing environmental activists,'' Earth First!
co-founder Mike Rosells said Thursday. ``But it's also possible this
is a smoke screen for an organized conspiracy to murder
environmental activists.''
   The FBI was concentrating on trying to find out if the explosion
that injured Bari and Cherney was linked to a blast that caused
minor damage at the Louisiana-Pacific mill in Cloverdale on May 9.
   The Oakland Police Department said it would continue to
concentrate its investigation on trying to prove Cherney, 33, of
Piercy, and Bari, 40, of Redwood, were transporting the pipe bomb
when it went off inside Bari's car.
   ``They're still the two prime suspects,'' Oakland police Sgt.
Robert Chenault said Thursday.
   Alameda County prosecutors, however, on Tuesday postponed filing
charges against the pair, saying they want to review the evidence.
   The two have strongly denied they were carrying the bomb, saying
they were the victims of an attack, possibly by someone who had been
sending the Earth First! activists death threats before planned
summer-long anti-logging demonstrations called ``Redwood Summer.''
   Cherney was released this week on $100,000 bail after Oakland
police arrested him for investigation of transporting explosives and
carrying a boobytrap. Bari remains hospitalized under police guard,
recovering from a broken pelvis and other injuries. She also is
being held on $100,000 bail.
   The letter writer warned he should be taken seriously.
   ``Doubt me not for I will tell you the design and materials such
as only I will Know,'' he wrote in an excerpt released Thursday by
The Press Democrat of Santa Rosa, which received the letter.
   The author claims to have been driven by religious zeal and anger
at Bari's opposition to anti-abortion protesters and to timber
cutting.
   The letter included specific details about the construction and
placement of the bomb that injured Cherney and Bari and had accurate
and never-disclosed information about the Cloverdale bomb, according
to Larry Sheets, a bomb expert with the Sonoma County Sheriff's
Department.
   Mawn said remnants of both pipe bombs would be sent to the FBI
laboratory in Washington D.C. by Friday for detailed analysis.
   The analysis could take weeks or months. The FBI doesn't
anticipate making arrests in the case until after the analysis is
completed, Mawn said.

   Laws in 44 states prohibit sales of cigarettes to
children, but they bought about 1 billion packs last year and
federal health inspectors know of citations against only 32 vendors.
   ``Very few states have laws that are effective in preventing
access to tobacco by minors,'' Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan said Thursday. ``Effective enforcement is the key to
successful efforts.''
   A week ago, Sullivan called for bans on cigarette machines,
licensing of tobacco retailers and a minimum age of 19 for tobacco
purchases.
   An estimated 1 billion packs of cigarettes are sold to children
in this country each year, said a report in the Journal of the
American Medical Association earlier this year.
   The national Centers for Disease Control noted in its weekly
report Thursday that 44 states and the District of Columbia have
laws restricting minors' access to tobacco. Thirty-six states
require cigarette buyers to be 18, three states set the age at 19,
four set it at 17 and one state and the District of Columbia set it
at 16.
   Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming
have no minimum age for sale of cigarettes. Kentucky will restrict
sales to minors under 16 beginning July 13.
   Only five states _ Alaska, Connecticut, Florida, New York and
Vermont _ could provide Sullivan's inspector general with data on
citations for tobacco sales to minors, said the CDC's Office on
Smoking and Health. And only three states reported any sales
violations at all in 1989 _ Florida with 16, Alaska with eight and
New York with eight.
   ``It's clear these laws are not enforced,'' said Dr. Tom Novotny
of the Office on Smoking and Health.
   Studies have indicated that 3 percent to 16 percent of underage
smokers get their cigarettes out of machines, Novotny said, while
the majority of sales to kids occur over the counter.
   Just six states _ Alaska, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Minnesota and
Utah _ prohibit cigarette machines in areas accessible to children
or ban such machines altogether, the CDC said.
   Novotny said dual strategies are needed to keep cigarettes out of
children's hands _ awareness by vendors and others in the community
and commitment from law enforcement officials to enforce cigarette
laws.
   Sullivan has proposed model legislation for states to control
tobacco sales to minors. Such laws would be ``a potentially
effective public health strategy to prevent tobacco use by
teen-agers,'' said the Atlanta-based CDC, an agency of HHS.
   But Sullivan's proposal has been criticized as too weak by the
Coalition on Smoking or Health and by U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., sponsor of a $110 million-a-year anti-smoking measure
pending in the Senate.

<HEAD>Minister: Talks With Tamil Rebels Progressing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior minister says talks between
the government and Tamil rebels have been progressing and there have
been few incidents of violence in areas where rebel attacks were
once common.
   ``The halt in killings in the north and east is a major
breakthrough,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said
Thursday.
   He said some fighters with the Tamil Tigers, also known as the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, have carried out several raids,
but rebel leaders appeared to support talks with the government.
   The Tiger rebels have been fighting the Sri Lankan government and
also fought an Indian peacekeeping force. The rebels have accused
the island's Sinhalese majority, which controls the government and
the military, of discrimination, but accepted negotiations in June
1989. India withdrew its troops in March, 1990.
   Tamils, who are mostly Hindu, make up 18 percent of the island's
16 million people.
   Talks have been held regularly in Colombo, the island's capital,
and in Jaffna, the northern stronghold of the Tigers, since last
June.
   Government communiques and independent reports have claimed that
since the truce began Tiger rebels have abducted and assaulted
policemen and soldiers, shot wild elephants and illegally felled
timber.
   ``The government's view, despite these provocative acts, is that
the talks are moving satisfactorily,'' Wijeratne said. ``We do not
want another war in which we will kill our own people.''
   He said the Tiger hierarchy has repeatedly expressed confidence
in President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
   Since the Tigers took up arms in 1983, more than 16,000 people
have died in the fighting.

   Strong aftershocks rocked jungle villages
in northern Peru, sending terrified residents into streets and town
squares two days after a killer earthquake rocked the region. The
death toll rose to at least 137.
   Hundreds of people whose homes were damaged slept on towels and
mats Thursday in the streets of Rioja and Moyobamba, the two largest
towns in the affected area about 400 miles north of Lima.
   The quake destroyed between 30 and 40 percent of the buildings in
the area, the civil defense office in Lima said.
   Civil defense officials in the earthquake zone said at least 137
people died in Tuesday's earthquake, which measured 6.3 on the
Richter scale.
   The government daily La Cronica, however, said more than 200 were
killed. The differing figures could not immediately be reconciled.
   Peru's Geophysical Institute in Lima said at least 70 aftershocks
had struck since Tuesday night, including one Thursday morning that
registered 4.6 on the Richter scale.
   All the tremors were centered around Moyobamba, a farming
community of 50,000 that produces corn, rice, coffee and sugar cane.
   The air above nearby Rioja, a town of 20,000, was thick with
smoke from outdoor cooking fires as residents crowded the central
square. Many held crying infants as they waited for aftershocks to
subside.
   ``All of us slept in the streets, but we were afraid to take out
our beds because we might be trapped by another tremor,'' said Flor
de Maria Masaboya of Rioja, pointing out a 3-inch-wide crack in her
adobe home.
   Several small villages around Moyobamba were the hardest hit.
   At least 23 people died in Soritor, a village six miles south of
Moyobamba, including 15 people in one family whose two-story house
collapsed on them.
   La Cronica reported Thursday that officials feared some remote
villages may have been buried by mudslides that resulted from the
quake, but civil defense officials could not confirm that. About 40
people were reported missing, and hundreds were injured.
   Authorities in Lima said the affected area was still without
electricity, water or telephone service.
   At least three military transport planes carrying doctors,
medical and food supplies had arrived at the Rioja airport by
Thursday afternoon, according to the government. Neighboring Chile
offered to send tents for those left homeless.
   Thursday marked the 20th anniversary of a devastating earthquake
that shook Peru's northern Andes Mountains, killing 70,000 people.
The 1970 quake registered 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.

<HEAD>Rush Hour Drive Scratched in Latest Gorbachev Tour Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The threat of rush hour traffic over the
Golden Gate Bridge apparently proved too much for organizers of
Mikhail Gorbachev's San Francisco tour.
   Tentative plans were scrapped Thursday for a Gorbachev motorcade
over the landmark span to Marin County.
   The Soviet leader and his wife, Raisa, will instead view the
bridge from a parking lot on the San Francisco side. Robert
Stockwell, president of the Golden Gate Bridge District, is to give
the Gorbachevs a tour Monday of gardens near the bridge's toll plaza.
   ``We want to show them the most beautiful part of the bridge and
show them the view that millions of visitors have admired,'' he said.
   Stockwell also is to present the Gorbachevs with several bridge
mementos, including a section of the original suspension cable, a
copy of Chief Engineer Joseph Strauss's original report on how and
why the bridge was built and a pair of sweat shirts.
   Civic leaders hope the trip will boost San Francisco's economic
spirits, devastated by the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   ``San Francisco has been feeling some of the downturn in business
ever since the earthquake,'' Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Carol
Piasente said. ``Having Gorbachev visit is a great boost to the
local economy.''
   At Stanford, the post office plans to issue a special envelope
Monday commemorating the Gorbachev visit with a special cancellation
design featuring Gorbachev's face above the word ``Stanford,''
written in Cyrillic alphabet.
   At City Hall in San Francisco, the Soviet flag will be flying.
Mayor Art Agnos, joined by Soviet Consul General Valentin Kamenev
and the city's chief of protocol, Charlotte Mailliard Swig, planned
to raise the flag today off the balcony of the mayor's office.
   ``There's a great deal of excitement about the visit,'' said Ms.
Piasente said. ``We're fielding hundreds of phone calls.''
   While Gorbachev meets with San Francisco business leaders, Mrs.
Gorbachev will take a separate tour of the city Monday afternoon,
traveling by motorcade to Golden Gate Park, the War Memorial Opera
House, Davies Symphony Hall, the Bank of America building and
Fisherman's Wharf.
   Earlier plans to include the Civic Center, where dozens of
homeless people have been living for months, were dropped.
   The Gorbachevs' whirlwind tour _ arriving in San Francisco Sunday
night and leaving Monday afternoon _ will include a bit of
socializing.
   Four members of a group called ``Friends of Raisa Gorbachev''
were scheduled to meet with Mrs. Gorbachev at the Soviet consul
general's residence for a ``nonpolitical, people-to-people''
conversation.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Final Order in School Desegregation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge permanently banned racial
discrimination in the city's public schools in his final order in a
16-year-old desegregation case.
   The order Thursday from U.S. District Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr.
barred ``creating, promoting or maintaining racial segregation in
any school or other facility in the Boston school system.''
   In a 1974 ruling on a lawsuit brought by black parents, Garrity
found the city's public schools were segregated. He ordered them
desegregated, and the resultant busing of students touched off years
of turmoil.
   Garrity monitored the city's compliance with his order until
1987, when a federal appeals court ruled that the schools were
desegregated and gave control over student assignment back to the
School Committee.
   Garrity continued to monitor school administration and
operations, however. He said Thursday's order would be his last.
   Perhaps the most controversial part of the four-page ruling was a
decree that teacher layoffs must follow court-ordered racial
guidelines rather than be based on seniority alone.
   That order, which means teachers and administrators must include
25 percent blacks and 10 percent other minorities, is to remain
until ``seniority would be a racially neutral standard,'' he said.
   Achieving a fully desegregated faculty and staff ``will be an
important milestone on the long road to affording equal educational
opportunity to all students in Boston's public schools,'' Garrity
wrote.
   More than 200 teachers are expected to be laid off _ nearly 800
have received layoff warnings _ before the next school year because
of budget limitations.
   The Boston Teachers Union's contract calls for layoffs strictly
on the basis of seniority. Union President Edward Doherty has said
the union would appeal any ruling that continued minority quotas,
which he said would mean many white teachers with 20 or more years
of experience would lose their jobs.
   But lawyers on both sides of the desegregation case praised
Garrity's final judgment.
   ``The order is consistent with affirmative action policies the
School Committee has in place and clarifies some issues that need
clarification concerning layoffs,'' said Henry Dinger, a lawyer for
the School Committee.
   Robert Pressman, a lawyer for black plaintiffs, said the ruling
shows that Garrity ``studied the papers carefully and manifests his
continuing steadfastness in protecting the rights of the plaintiff
class.''

   A deputy who arrested a 3-year-old for
uprooting a neighbor's flamingo lawn ornaments exercised ``poor
judgment,'' his commander says.
   Tony Salgado, a wide-eyed boy with curly blond hair, wandered
onto his neighbor's lawn two weeks ago, pulled out two ornamental
pink plastic flamingos and dropped them in the driveway. The
neighbor called police.
   Deputy J. Burnett of the Hernando County Sheriff's Office arrived
at the scene and filed an affidavit charging Tony with criminal
mischief, said Sheriff's Capt. Rich Nugent. Burnett ordered the boy
held under house arrest, and also referred the case to state social
workers.
   Nugent said he immediately stopped charges after learning about
the incident late last week.
   ``It was poor judgment,'' Nugent said. ``Obviously, we don't
condone this.''
   Burnett and Sgt. Lanny Corlew, who reviewed Burnett's affidavit,
may face disciplinary action, Nugent said, although Corlew said he
did not notice the boy's age.
   Tony, meanwhile, has promised not to uproot any more flamingos.
   ``That's a no-no,'' he said Wednesday as he rolled in a pile of
laundry on his living room floor.

   Abram Shorin, co-founder with three brothers of
the Topps baseball card company, died Monday in Miami at the age of
91.
   At the suggestion of a nephew, Shorin put bubble gum together
with baseball cards in 1951, and Topps Co. Inc. became the world's
largest manufacturer of the two products. The company was founded in
1938.
   In 1953, Topps gave consumers the comic character Bazooka Joe to
accompany the bubble gum, which is sold in 55 countries. Before the
comic strip, the gum was manufactured in a funnel shape, like a
humorous musical instrument, called a bazooka. The bazooka also gave
its name to the armor-piercing gun.

   President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev headed today toward a new round of summit talks shadowed
by disputes over Germany and Lithuania but assured of yielding
agreement on long-sought curbs on strategic nuclear weapons and
poison gas.
   Before he met with Bush at the White House, Gorbachev summoned
leading members of Congress to the Soviet Embassy for an exchange
that was expected to focus on trade, arms control and Gorbachev's
economic squeeze on the breakaway Baltic republic of Lithuania.
   Bush and Gorbachev were upbeat after their initial talks
Wednesday, even though they concluded they would be unable to
resolve the issue of German unification before Gorbachev leaves
Sunday. They left the German question for their foreign affairs
experts to tackle later.
   However, both U.S. and Soviet officials today saw encouraging
signs in the summit exchanges over a united Germany and its future
military role.
   ``Now we are moving closer to each other,'' said Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, interviewed on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America.''
   Although the German issue won't be settled at the summit,
Gerasimov said, ``we understand better the arguments'' and that is
``a very good sign for the summit.''
   Both Gerasimov and chief U.S. arms negotiator Richard Burt,
interviewed on the same program, said European security arrangements
must be overhauled as a result of dramatic changes in East-West
relations.
   Burt said the United States is ``taking a new look at security
and institutions in Europe, including a concept of remodeling NATO
for a new era.'' He said it was important for the Soviets to
understand that U.S. moves are ``not designed to undermine Soviet
security.''
   Gorbachev displayed his trademark spontaneity Wednesday when he
halted his limousine one block east of the White House, during a
brief evening ride to the Soviet Embassy. Wading into a crowd of
pedestrians on the sidewalk, he exulted, ``I feel really at home
here.''
   Bush offered a light moment at the end of the day. Toasting
Gorbachev at a glittering White House state dinner _ Maine lobster
was on the menu _ he said expectations were at a fever pitch for the
events of Day Two. ``When Barbara and Raisa go to Wellesley
College,'' he deadpanned. The first ladies were traveling there for
commencement ceremonies.
   The White House said the two men would sign a treaty late today
ending production of chemical weapons and sharply trimming poison
gas stockpiles.
   An agreement also was ready for their signatures outlining
agreement on major points of a treaty to scale back long-range
nuclear weapons. Accompanying it was a pledge to pursue deeper
reductions after the first treaty is completed.
   The treaty, nearly a decade in negotiations, will eventually
reduce stockpiles of long range nuclear missiles, bombers and
submarines, by 30 to 35 percent. From the U.S. viewpoint, the key
provision will halve the number of Soviet SS-18 missiles capable of
reaching the United States.
   The pact on chemical weapons would halt production of poison gas
and reduce each country's stockpiles to 5,000 tons. The United
States currently has about 25,000 tons and the Soviet Union twice
that amount.
   Bush called the pacts ``proof that differences can be resolved _
even while others remain.''
   One of the major differences centered on Lithuania, where
Gorbachev has applied economic pressure to quell an independence
drive.
   Bush prodded Gorbachev on the subject in his welcoming remarks
outside the White House, and said Lithuania and the related topic of
expanded trade relations might come up in summit talks.
   At the State Department, other agreements were ready for signing
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze covering air travel, oceanography and maritime
issues.
   And despite the continuing impasse over Germany, the two sides
were reportedly making some progress in arms control talks
continuing at the State Department, and laying plans for future
negotiations.
   Gorbachev told reporters that while the issue of German
unification would not be resolved at the summit, Baker and
Shevardnadze would discuss the issue next week at an international
conference in Copenhagen, and again in late June in Berlin. As hopes
for a German accord faded, so did chances for agreement on a
reduction in troops and conventional arms in Europe.
   Even so, Soviet spokesman Arkady Maslennikov said he looked for
two more Gorbachev-Bush meetings this year, one to ratify agreements
on a new Europe and the second late in 1990 to sign the nuclear arms
control treaty.
   Bush and Gorbachev said their wide-ranging discussions on
Wednesday included detailed discussions of Germany. Gorbachev and
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said new ideas had been
exchanged, but another U.S. official said that wasn't the case.
``The bottom line is both presidents restated their well-known
positions,'' the official said.
   The partial economic blockade the Soviets have imposed on
Lithuania has deterred Bush from approving a new trade agreement
with Moscow, details of which were completed last week. Bush also
has ruled out a trade pact until the Soviets enact liberal
emigration legislation.

<HEAD>Government Declares State of Emergency in Two Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has declared a 30-day state of
emergency in the capital and nearby port of Callao in advance of the
June 10 presidential runoff election.
   The runoff pits novelist Mario Vargas Llosa against Alberto
Fujimori, an agricultural engineer whose parents emigrated from
Japan.
   A similar state of emergency, which gives the military broad
powers to fight leftist guerrillas, was in effect during the first
round balloting on April 8.
   The decree announced Thursday places the two cities under
military control and allows authorities to restrict freedom of
movement, detain people without filing charges and search residences
without warrants.
   In Lima, the capita and home to a third of Peru's 22 million
people, the state of emergency will be administered by the national
police.
   A state of emergency remains in effect for eight departments and
one province, where government troops are battling Maoist Shining
Path guerrillas. The areas are located in Peru's central and
southern highlands and northern jungle region.
   In the southern highlands, police said on Thursday that Shining
Path guerrillas killed eight people in three towns near the city of
Huancavelica, 145 miles southeast of Lima.
   A column of 15 rebels entered the town of Pueblo Libre on
Wednesday night and abducted three former village officials from
their homes, police said. The officials were later shot to death in
a field near the town.
   At the same time, another guerrilla band shot to death the town
manager and two other officials in the village of Tansire, police
said.
   In another Wednesday night raid, the rebels fatally stabbed two
peasants near the town of Condorsurco and stole 20 head of cattle,
police said.
   The government says that more than 18,500 people have died in
violence since the Shining Path guerrillas launched their insurgency
in 1980.
   The government first imposed a state of emergency in December
1982 in Ayacucho, birthplace of the rebel movement.
   Since then the measure has been steadily extended to other areas
as the rebel violence has expanded.

   AIDS experts were hopeful that a new
experimental drug will slow the progress of the deadly disease and
prove less toxic and cheaper than the anti-viral drugs AZT and DDI.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has made Hoffman-La Roche's
drug DDC available to AIDS patients in a ``compassionate use
program'' designed to test the safety of the drug, the
pharmaceutical company and the FDA announced Thursday.
   ``The most exciting thing about DDC is that it is looking more
and more to be the drug that DDI was supposed to be,'' said Dr. Jay
Lalezari, co-director to the HIV Clinical Research Center at Mount
Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
   ``We don't know the efficacy, but it looks like it is
well-tolerated,'' he said.
   New York-based Bristol Myers has been distributing the
experimental drug DDI free in a similar compassionate use program to
about 8,000 patients who are not responding to AZT treatment or
cannot tolerate AZT.
   The side effects of DDI include nausea, diarrhea and depression,
but DDC, which stands for dideoxycytidine, has shown few side
effects, Lalezari said.
   AZT is the only AIDS drug approved by the FDA. DDC, because it is
still classified as experimental, is available only in clinical
trials. The compassionate use program announced Thursday expands
those trials.
   Though it does not cure AIDS, AZT prolongs the lives of some
people infected by the virus. Others have stopped taking the drug
because of side effects such as anemia and depletion of bone marrow.
   There are two ongoing clinical trials in which researchers are
comparing the effectiveness of DDC and AZT. Patients do not know
which of the two drugs they are receiving.
   Hoffman-La Roche will begin a study June 25 with 50 patients who
cannot tolerate DDI or AZT. The study will assess the toxicity and
effectiveness of DDC.
   If little toxicity is found, the program will be expanded to 200
patients after four weeks and opened to unlimited enrollment after
four months.
   This approach is a compromise in a bitter controversy between
some people with AIDS and researchers who fear participants in
clinical trials will drop out if the drugs are available elsewhere.
AIDS activists have staged street protests to demand that all
promising drugs be made available to any desperately ill patients
willing to risk untested remedies.
   Jim Eigo, a member of the AIDS Research Advisory Council, said
the combination of DDC and AZT seems to be more effective than
either drug alone.
   ``In addition, the combination is less harmful because their
toxicities do not overlap,'' Eigo said.
   DDC's low manufacturing cost could make the drug much less
expensive than AZT, which can cost up to $8,000 for a year's
treatment, said John James of the AIDS Treatment Newsletter.
   James said it costs about five cents to make a day's dose of DDC.
The final price of the drug, if approved, would be much higher,
however, because it would include the costs of clinical trials,
research and development, marketing and a profit.
   ``It's simply too early to know what the price would be,'' said
Hoffman-La Roche spokeswoman Karen Kmetik.

<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to ADD report on sentences for officers in coup
attempt.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eritrean rebels claim they killed 7,000
government troops in the latest battle in their offensive to capture
Asmara, the besieged capital of Ethiopia's northernmost province.
   Also today, the official Ethiopian News Agency reported that a
military court had sentenced 18 army officers stationed in Eritrea
to prison terms ranging from two to seven years for their
involvement in a failed May 1989 coup attempt aimed at overthrowing
President Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   The news agency said the military court ordered the release of
three other officers linked to the coup attempt because they had
served sufficient terms in pre-trial custody.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said in a clandestine
broadcast Thursday that its fighters had also wounded about 4,000
government troops and captured 1,100 in winning their second victory
in a week of heavy fighting southeast of Asmara.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, said the fighting was on the
Segeneyti Front, 30 miles from Asmara. ``The offensive is continuing
to push forward with vigor,'' the rebel broadcast said.
   On Tuesday, the Eritreans said they had ``completely routed''
government troops during another battle on the same front.
   It was not possible to verify independently the rebel claims, but
a broadcast on state-controlled radio in the Ethiopian capital,
Addis Ababa, implied there were heavy casualties on the government
side.
   ``The joint offensive by the EPLF and the Weyane (Tigreans) on
the Segeneyti Front is being repulsed by our revolutionary army with
great martyrdom,'' the government broadcast said Thursday.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front, another smaller rebel group,
is fighting a 15-year-old insurgency to oust the nation's president
and establish a hard-line Marxist government.
   The Tigreans control their home province of Tigre, Eritrea's
southern neighbor. The Eritreans and Tigreans often coordinate their
offensives.
   The Ethiopian News Agency said the officers sentenced to prison
for the coup attempt ranged in rank from lieutenant to colonel.
   Although troops loyal to President Mengistu quickly crushed the
rebellion in Addis Ababa May 16, 1989, the mutineers in Eritrea held
out for three days.
   The officers' sentences were considered light compared to the
death penalties imposed on 12 generals, including the commander of
all ground forces and the air force chief of staff, who were
convicted of treason for their role in the coup attempt.
   The executions, announced May 21, have led to nearly two weeks of
sporadic student demonstrations at the University of Addis Ababa.
   The trial of another 35 senior officers is continuing, while an
additional 130 officers are yet to be tried.
   The Eritreans are fighting a 29-year-old war for the independence
of Eritrea, a former Italian colony annexed by Ethiopia in 1962.
They launched their current offensive Feb. 8 and captured the Red
Sea port of Massawa three days later, cutting off all but air access
to Asmara.

   More than 30 years ago, a college prank
cut short Fay Vincent's hopes of an athletic career. Saturday night,
the baseball commissioner returns to the college campus where his
dreams were shattered.
   But the baseball commissioner said his trip to Williams College
as a commencement speaker won't resurrect bad memories of the fall
that left him permanently injured.
   ``It's a very nice honor and I'll be happy to be up there,''
Vincent said in a recent interview. ``It was a wonderful college. I
got a fine education.''
   A 1960 graduate of the school in the picturesque Berkshire
community of Williamstown, Vincent was the strapping captain of the
freshman football team when he was locked in his room by a friend.
Climbing out the window onto an icy ledge, Vincent slipped and fell
four stories, crushing two vertebrae.
   Doctors rebuilt the vertebrae, but Vincent must still sometimes
use a cane to walk.
   Though he had played some baseball as a teen-ager, Vincent's
career hopes had been pinned on football. But his love for baseball
grew during his long convalescence as he turned to game broadcasts
to pass the time.
   He was selected baseball commissioner last fall after
commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti died.
   Vincent will be the baccalaureate speaker Saturday night and will
receive an honorary doctor of laws degree Sunday.

<TEXT>
   A teen-age boy was installed today as
Kashmir's top Moslem clergyman to succeed his assassinated father,
and Kashmiris used the occasion to renew a call for independence.
   Amid recitals of Koranic verses, 16-year-old Umar Farooq took his
place as the mirwaiz maulvi, or chief preacher, of Kashmir during a
special service in the Jama Masjid, Kashmir's largest mosque.
   About 100,000 Moslems thronged the mosque and an equal number
crowded the streets around the building to mark the installation
that coincided with the Moslem sabbath.
   Ghulam Pandey, head priest of a local mosque, wrapped a turban
around Farooq's head, formalizing his appointment as the mirwaiz.
Other priests showered the new preacher with rose petals.
   The boy, wearing a loose shirt and trousers and a brocaded silk
gown, then climbed a black marble dais and read from the Koran, the
Islamic holy book, for 30 minutes as the congregation listened in
rapt attention.
   After Farooq's sermon, the Moslems shouted in Urdu: ``Join hand
to hand, give the mujahedeen a sturdy stand,'' and ``What do we
want? We want independence.'' The militants are commonly called
mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   Outside the mosque, militants burned Indian flags and copies of
the autobiography of former Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru,
a Kashmiri Hindu.
   Several Moslems, inside and outside the mosque, began weeping as
Farooq read the Koran.
   ``We used to listen to his father read the Koran every Friday.
Today he is no more,'' said an old man who refused to identify
himself.
   Umar's father, Mirwaiz Maulvi Farooq was killed by three
unidentified gunmen in his Srinagar home on May 21. A few hours
later security forces opened fire on a crowd carrying Farooq's body
in defiance of a curfew, killing 58 people and wounding 300.
   The toll was the highest in one day in security force action
since they launched a crackdown on Kashmiri separatists Jan. 20.
   At least 486 people have been killed since then. Most were
militants or supporters of the campaign for the independence of
Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Moslem-majority state, from the
predominantly Hindu India.
   Kashmir, a former princely state, was divided along a
still-disputed forntier between India and Pakistan after British
colonial India became independent in 1947 and was partitioned along
religious lines.
   The border dispute has also led to a harsh war of words between
India and Pakistan and has raised fears of a fourth war between the
two countries.
   Two of the previous wars were over Kashmir and both were won by
India. Pakistan also lost the third war, when India helped
Bangladesh become independent from Pakistan.
   About 64 percent of the 6 million people in Indian-governed
Jammu-Kashmir state are Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems account for 12
percent of India's 880 million people while Hindus comprise 82
percent.

<HEAD>U.S. Vetoes Council Fact-Finding Mission to Israel, Angers Arabs</HEAD>

   The United States vetoed a Security Council
resolution calling for a fact-finding mission on abuses against
Palestinians in Israeli-occupied lands, drawing sharp criticism from
Arab states.
   In Jerusalem, Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied lands
said today they were cutting off contacts with U.S. officials
because of the veto.
   Arab nations said the 14-1 vote Thursday in favor of the
resolution demonstrated that the United States and Israel are
isolated on Middle East issues.
   The observer of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Zuhdi
Labib Terzi, called it ``a sad day'' in the Security Council ``when
one member blocks the council from responding to its responsibility
to report on an alarming situation.''
   After the council meeting, Clovis Maksoud, observer of the
22-nation Arab League, vowed to raise the issue again in the
council, despite the risk of another U.S. veto.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the resolution was
``more likely to add to the problems, rather than help resolve the
peace process in the region.''
   ``This resolution does not focus on the real need to move the
peace process forward,'' Pickering said. ``Rather, it could too
easily become a vehicle which could be misused to generate more
needless controversy,'' he told the 15-member council.
   The United States favors an envoy dispatched by the U.N.
secretary-general to investigate violence in the territories.
   Israel, however, opposes any fact-finding mission, and Israeli
officials said they will not permit U.N. officials or Security
Council members to enter its territory.
   The United States frequently has voted in favor of its Israeli
ally and has used its Security Council veto power to shield Israel
from harsh criticism in the council.
   During the council meeting, Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein said
the PLO had fanned violence in the territories and was murdering its
own dissidents.
   More than 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire
during the 30-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the
territories.
   In addition, more than 210 Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.
Forty-five Israelis have also been killed.
   Thursday's council session was a continuation of the meeting that
began May 25 in Geneva, Switzerland. At that meeting, PLO chief
Yasser Arafat called for a U.N. military observer force to protect
Palestinians.
   The meeting was prompted by the May 20 killing of seven
Palestinian laborers by an Israeli gunman the government described
as deranged.
   Palestinians rioted in protest, and at least 15 were killed in
clashes with Israeli forces.
   The Palestinian leaders in the territories today called on the
Arab world to take ``serious and decisive positions'' against
America, including withdrawing funds from U.S. institutions,
boycotting U.S. products, and cutting off its supply of oil.
   The U.S. veto was ``a new indication it (the Bush administration)
is unfit to have any responsibility at all in the peace process in
the Middle East,'' said a statement read at a news conference. ``We
declare our boycott, our refusal, to conduct any official contacts
with the American Consulate, with any American representative or
emissary.''
   It was endorsed by 43 Palestinian leaders from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip who gathered at a hotel in
east Jerusalem to end a 13-day hunger strike. The protest was called
to demand better protection for Palestinians after the May 20
killings.
   Don B. Cofman, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Israel, had no
comment.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel said today that his
government was ``glad'' about the U.S. veto.
   The resolution that was vetoed would have established a three-man
commission from the council to immediately ``examine the situation
relating to the policies and practices of Israel, the occupying
power, in the Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, occupied
since 1967.''
   The council includes five permanent members with veto power and
10 members serving 2-year terms.

   Gorbachev in the past has traveled aboard an Ilyushin 62M
four-engine jet that bore the standard blue markings of Aeroflot,
the Soviet airline.
   But the plane that brought him to the United States had the words
Sovyetski Soyuz, which is Russian for Soviet Union, painted on the
fuselage just above the windows.
   Air Force One and a fleet of similar planes the Air Force

the Soviet office at the press center, was just as frustrated as the
reporters he was trying to help.
   Ustimenko had heard _ but couldn't confirm _ that Raisa Gorbachev
would be accepting a painting as a gift sometime Thursday. But he
didn't know where the event was to take place and he couldn't get
through to the Soviet Embassy.
   ``Busy,'' he told a reporter who muttered that the press
operation was ``useless.''
   Ustimenko kept his humor, though. The problem, he said, was that
he was used to using a cellular telephone.
   For the record, Mrs. Gorbachev never paid a noontime visit to
accept paintings, but she did attend a Library of Congress reception
where she was given framed items.

   Anton Kumankov lives in Moscow, but he had to
come to the Capital Children's Museum here to meet Raisa Gorbachev.
   Children's portraits by Kumankov, a book illustrator, are on
display until June 17 at the hands-on museum housed in a former
school building near Capitol Hill. He was visiting the United States
when he got the call from a museum official that Mrs. Gorbachev
would be stopping by.
   While awaiting her arrival Thursday, Kumankov milled about his
exhibit _ two rooms of portraits of solemn, big-eyed children, most
drawn in pencil on paper.
   His favorite portrait is called ``Natasha and her dog Pif.''
   ``This is a very nice-looking girl, but she thinks she is not
beautiful and she suffers very much. This dog very much resembles
its owner,'' Kumankov said.
   Since he drew Natasha, he said, ``her parents never called
again.'' Why?
   Because the picture was published all over the Soviet Union and
``some journalists wrote a letter saying `Dear Natasha, don't worry,
one day you'll be beautiful and you will not resemble your dog
anymore.'''
   Kumankov looks the part of the artist, with longish red hair,
glasses and big bow ties he says he likes because 19th century
painters wore them. Almost totally deaf, he also wears two hearing
aids.
   He is not expecting his life to change because of his unexpected
encounter with Raisa Gorbachev.
   ``I'm interested in doing more art,'' he said, ``and that's
exactly what I have been doing for the past 10 years.''

   The United States Information Agency office is
in a racquetball court. The food service is in a weight room. And
the briefing room is in a basketball arena, complete with cement,
bleachers and ceiling pipes.
   The international press center for this year's contingent of
summit journalists is a little different than the pampering and
plush service of 1987.
   The J.W. Marriott went all out that year. The press had its own
marble ballroom with crystal chandeliers. The hotel provided free
coffee and sodas, plus press releases on how much coffee and sodas
journalists had consumed.
   ``It was beautiful,'' reminisced Victor Karasin, an aide in the
Soviet press office. ``We even had the Glasnost Cafe on the ground
floor.''
   The Smith Center at George Washington University does have the
Summit Minimart for those needing aspirin or souvenirs, but it's not
the same. The food service, a carryout in a cinder-block workout
room, serves exotic dishes such as styrofoam plates of egg salad and
cardboard boxes of cereal.
   Reporters can be seen tripping on the floor of the briefing
center, which has been covered with large, taped-together pieces of
carpet in varying shades of gray, punctuated by inexplicable
subterranean bumps and slightly raised wooden platforms.
   The many TV cameras in the room, however, are focused on an
attractive wooden podium backed by large U.S. and Soviet flags.
   On television, it all looks fine.

   The government introduced
legislation today that would repeal the Separate Amenities Act, a
pillar of apartheid that has allowed racial segregation of all
public amenities for nearly 40 years.
   The legislation, which would take effect Oct. 15, will be
submitted to Parliament on Monday, where it is expected pass by
mid-June, the South African Press Associated reported.
   Since 1953, the Separate Amenities Act has authorized provincial
governments, municipalities and privately owned entertainment
establishments to reserve facilities for whites. If the law is
repealed, public bathrooms, libraries and transporation _ as well as
privately owned restaurants and nightclubs _ could no longer be
segregated.
   Many public amenities already have been integrated in
Johannesburg, but dated laws remain on the books.
   The effort to repeal the Separate Amenities Act was the latest
move by President F.W. de Klerk to end apartheid. He has said he
intends to give South Africa's black majority the vote by 1994, but
he has stopped short of endorsing black majority rule.
   The largest white opposition party, the Conservative Party, is
the only parliamentary group expected to oppose repealing the
Separate Amenities Act. But the party does not have enough votes to
block it.
   Hernus Kriel, minister of provincial affairs and planning, said
the legislation would not take effect until October to give those
affected time to prepare for the changes.
   Kriel said that if the act is repealed, no South African
individual or institution would enjoy legal protection for
discrimination on the basis of race in any facility generally open
to the public.
   Apartheid, the system of racial separation and white minority
domination, was encoded into law by the National Party when it came
to power in 1948.
   Other pillars of the system that remain are laws that reserve
most of the country's land for white ownership and put power in the
hands of the white minority by denying a national vote to blacks.
   Since taking office in September, de Klerk has legalized dozens
of outlawed black political organizations, freed scores of political
prisoners, legalized a few, small multiracial neighborhoods,
suspended the death penalty, ended segregation of beaches and
ordered the end of segregated hospitals.
   Still, de Klerk opposes one-person, one-vote majority rule and
suggests a system where cultural, social and ethnic groups could be
sure to have representation in the government.
   The Conservative Party and white extremist organizations have
denounced de Klerk's actions as treason to the white Afrikaners who
control the government. Some have said they are willing to defend
their rights under apartheid with force, if necessary.
   Opening government and entertainment facilities to whites would
partly depend on government employees, many of whom support the
Conservative Party or generally oppose the rapid changes taking
place.
   Two weeks ago, Health Minister Rina Venter announced that
segregation of all hospitals had ended.
   However, this week, the administrator of the country's 44 white
hospitals gave his interpretation of that order. He said hospitals
designated for whites would continue to give preference in admission
to white patients because they are residents of the area where the
hospitals are located.
   Although segregation at government-run resorts and recreation
areas officially ended months ago, blacks, Indians and people of
mixed race continue to be turned away. Some local administrators of
the resorts say they have not yet received the official government
orders telling them to admit people who are not white.

   U.S. officials are asking Japan to help pick up the
tab for an $8 billion superconducting supercollider that could
answer basic questions about th nature of matter and the origin of
the universe.
   Deputy Secretary of Energy Henson Moore, who is heading a
visiting U.S. delegation, told reporters he would present a letter
from President Bush to Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, inviting Japan
to become a partner in the supercollider project to be built in
Texas.
   ``We have asked Japan to be the first country to participate ...
because of their technical expertise ... and also because they have
the capability of being a partner,'' Moore said.
   ``The size and the expense of building this project is such that
no one country can do it alone,'' he added. ``And we believe that
for it to be a scientific success, it must be an international
project.''
   Moore did not specify the amount the U.S. government wants Japan
to contribute. The Kyodo News Service reported that the United
States wants Japan to allocate $1 billion for the project.
   Backers say the racetrack-shaped supercollider, which would
encircle Waxahachie, Texas with a 54-mile tunnel, would be the
world's most powerful particle accelerator and its largest
scientific instrument.
   The Department of Energy says the supercollider's 12,000
superconducting magnets will produce a magnetic field 150,000 times
as strong as Earth's and send streams of protons smashing against
each other at nearly the speed of light to break them into subatomic
particles.
   Scientists then would study the tiny pieces of matter produced in
hopes of finding previously unobservable particlesthat would provide
clues to how the universe began.
   Scientists say such intensely powerful collisions will
approximate the ``big bang'' explosion that some believe created the
universe.
   The cost of the project has grown from an initial $4.4 billion to
about $8 billion.
   Earlier this month, the U.S. House of Representatives authorized
$5 billion in spending over several years on the supercollider, and
Texas agreed to provide about $1 billion to get the project.
   The government hopes that the remaining $2 billion will come
largely from foreign sources, Department of Energy officials said.
   Some U.S. congressmen have demanded Japan bear a large portion of
the cost because of its trade imbalance with the United States, but
others have warned that foreign involvement would result in a giving
away U.S. technology.
   Moore said the United States wanted Japan as a partner because of
its ability to contribute both scientifically and financially to the
project.
   Moore said Japan also has shown ``an understanding of the need to
spend more on basic research.''
   Japan spends less of its gross national product than the United
States on basic scientific research, but more on applied research.
It frequently has taken the discoveries of basic research conducted
elsewhere and developed them into new consumer products.
   Participation in research projects at the superconducting
supercollider would be open to any nation, regardless of whether it
helps fund it, as is true with most such particle accelerators,
Moore said.
   Department of Energy officials said up to half the accelerator's
magnets could be provided by Japan, which already has developed a
prototype of a magnetically levitated train that uses
superconducting magnets.
   Each cylindrical magnet will be 45-feet-long and weigh 13.2 tons,
the department says.
   After a week in Japan, the U.S. delegation is to visit South
Korea to seek its participation in the project. The only country
that has already officially agreed to participate is India, which
pledged $50 million.
   The world's most powerful collider is a 17-mile ring near Geneva
that was completed last year.
   The U.S. delegation here made the funding request at meetings
with Education Minister Kosuke Hori; Tomoji Oshima, director general
of the Science and Technology Agency; and Ichiji Ishii, deputy
foreign minister.

<HEAD>Rembrandt Painting Fails To Sell; Price Below Seller's Expectation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Rembrandt painting of a remorseful St. Peter
failed to sell because the highest bid at auction was lower than the
minimum price set by the seller, Christie's auction house said.
   The bidding on ``St. Peter Repentant'' stopped Thursday at $9.5
million, said Dana Micucci, a spokeswoman for Christie's.
   The 1631 painting had been estimated to be worth at least $10
million. Micucci said sellers usually set a reserve price ``a little
bit below the low estimate.''
   ``St. Peter Repentant'' was the first Rembrandt painting put on
the auction block since the artist's ``Portrait of a Girl Wearing a
Gold-trimmed Cloak'' fetched $10.38 million in 1986.
   The St. Peter painting, a 23-by-18-inch oil on oak panel, was put
up for auction by an anonymous private American collector.
   ``I was quite surprised it didn't sell,'' said Ian Kennedy,
director of Old Master collections at Christie's. ``I didn't think
it would be that easy, but I thought we would manage to do it.''
   Kennedy said the picture's present owner bought it about two
years ago from a Belgian family. Doris Athineos, a Christie's
spokeswoman, said the auction house did not know how much the
present owner had paid for it.
   Old Master paintings typically do not fetch the premium prices
paid at auction for Impressionist and modern paintings, Kennedy said.
   ``The Old Masters are rather dark. People like bright-colored
pictures,'' Kennedy explained. ``It's also the subject matter. Old
Masters are more religious and serious. People prefer subject matter
that is less demanding.''
   The record price for an Old Master painting is $35.2 million,
paid by the Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., last year for a portrait
of Duke Cosimo I de' Medici by Pontormo.
   Contemporary, Impressionist and modern sales in May posted record
prices for works of masterpiece quality.
   Van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' sold for $82.5 million, the
highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. Two days later,
Renoir's depiction of an open-air dance hall fetched $78.1 million.
   Both paintings were bought by a Japanese businessman.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coca-Cola Co. has scrapped its ``MagiCan''
promotion because of complaints of prizes that failed to pop out of
cans and leaks of foul-tasting chlorinated water.
   The Atlanta-based soft drink company had planned to distribute
750,000 of the special cans throughout the summer, but spokesman
Randy Donaldson confirmed Thuursday the shipments had been halted
after about 200,000 were shipped.
   The randomly distributed cans looked like regular cans of
Coca-Cola Classic but contained a mechanism that ejected either cash
or prize certificates. The bottom end of the can was filled with
chlorinated water to make it feel like the real thing.
   But some consumers reported that the prize mechanism jammed,
keeping it from ejecting. And in some cases the chlorinated water,
which tastes bad but is harmless, leaked.
   Though Coke received only about 70 complaints about defective
cans, Donaldson said, ``There is the impression we don't like among
our consumers that there is a problem with the promotion.''
   ``We are winding it down early,'' Donaldson said.
   The cancellation came one week after Coca-Cola ran full-page
advertisements in newspapers across the nation acknowledging the
problems and explaining how the prize cans work.
   Donaldson said television ads are telling consumers that only a
few prize cans are left on the market and that they will be ``going,
going, gone by mid-June.''
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of the soft drink industry trade
publication Beverage Digest, said Coca-Cola had little choice but to
end the promotion in view of the publicity.
   ``Once again, perception is greater than reality,'' Meyers said.
   ``I think it is the right move, because the soft drink industry
has a golden bond with the consumer,'' he said. ``And whatever the
reality may be, the perception has to be that the quality has to be
better than the norm of any other food product.''
   Other aspects of the ``Magic Summer'' promotion, which began May
7, are to continue, Donaldson said.

   Fire trucks pumped high-pressure streams
into homes today to wash away mud and debris left by flash flooding
that sent several feet of water into subdivisions in this
Mississippi River town.
   ``I've been back to my home and everything is turned over and
destroyed,'' said Hope Williams, who spent Thursday night with her
six children at an emergency shelter. ``That was my first year in
the subdivision and I hope it was my last year _ I mean, water was
six feet deep in that house.''
   Williams, whose children range in age from 2 to 17, said ``the
only thing we can do now is put together what we've got left and try
to move from down there.''
   About 200 people were evacuated from low-lying homes during
Thursday's flooding. Vicksburg-Warren County Civil Defense chief
Luther Warnock Jr. said today that 187 homes and two businesses were
flooded before water receded late Thursday.
   The National Weather Service said the area was hit with about 7
inches of rain.
   No injuries were reported, said Warren County Sheriff Paul
Barrett.
   ``We were lucky,'' he said. ``We packed some people out on our
backs and some out in boats, but we didn't lose anybody.''
   Barrett said some residents could probably return to their houses
today, but others may have to wait through the weekend.
   Warnock said he had been in Vicksburg for 30 years and ``while a
lot of the areas flooded Thursday had flooded before, this was the
worst flooding we've had in a flash flood. People I've talked to say
they've never seen anything like this before.''
   City and county officials met today to issue formal disaster
declarations, the first step in seeking state and federal disaster
funds.
   Warnock said officials were still estimating damage, ``and we
expect quite a lot.'' He said the water also damaged bridges and
roadways in the county of 50,000 people.
   Gov. Ray Mabus declared a state of emergency in Warren County
late Thursday. The Mississippi National Guard was placed on standby
but Warnock said the guardsmen were not needed.

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of the Russian
Federation, promised his Lithuanian counterpart today he will foster
close ties between his huge republic and the secessionist Baltic
region, Lithuanian sources said.
   Yeltsin's offer represents a slap in the face for Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who ordered an economic blockade
against Lithuania in an effort to force it to back off its March
independence declaration.
   If Russia were to resume supplying Lithuania with gas, oil and
other raw materials, it would mean the virtual end of the Kremlin's
sanctions _ without Gorbachev's consent.
   But Yeltsin has not explicitly said he intends to provide such
goods to Lithuania. Morever, it is not clear whether his republic
could gain practical authority to do so, even if it adopts an
autonomy plan championed by Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin, who was elected president of the Russian republic
Tuesday, met with Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis for ``a
very friendly talk with full mutual understanding,'' said Natasha
Boganova, secretary of the Lithuanian representation in Moscow,
where the two met.
   ``Yeltsin is prepared, as soon as Russia gets its sovereignty, to
cooperate fully with the Baltic republics, and Lithuania first of
all,'' she said.
   Lithuania, struggling to circumvent the blockade, has been
seeking direct ties with newly elected radical leaders in various
parts of the country.
   On Thursday, the legislature of the republic of Moldavia
recognized Lithuania's independence, the official Tass news agency
reported, making it the first Soviet republic outside the Baltics to
do so.
   The move represented another challenge to Gorbachev's efforts to
isolate Lithuania from the rest of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has demanded Lithuania suspend its declaration of
independence before the blockade can be lifted and talks begun.
Lithuanian lawmakers have offered compromise measures, but they
refuse to suspend the declaration.
   Landsbergis plans to meet with delegates from Moscow and
Leningrad, where radicals have taken over the city administrations,
and delegates from other parts of Russia, the Lithuanian
parliament's information service said.
   Yeltsin has said he expects the Russian parliament to declare the
Russian Federation's sovereignty within the first 100 days of his
term.
   The Russian Federation is the Soviet Union's largest republic,
with two-thirds of its territory and just over half its population.
   Sovereignty would mean republic authorities would have the final
say over which Soviet laws are valid on Russian territory, and
greater independence in general from the national government.
   But even if a Russian-Baltic accord is worked out, it might not
be soon enough for the Lithuanians, who are racing to establish
alternate sources of supply before their fuel runs out altogether.
   About 46,000 people have been laid off and eight factories closed
because of the blockade, Lithuanian radio has reported. Many
residents of Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, have been without hot
water for weeks.
   Lithuanian radio reported that Poland will begin supplying the
republic with cooking oil and sugar _ at steeper prices than Soviet
suppliers commanded.
   In neighboring Latvia, which declared May 4 it had begun its move
toward independence, rationing of several food staples began today,
Tass said.
   The Kremlin has not extended its economic sanctions to Latvia,
but residents fearing a blockade began panic-buying after the May 4
declaration.
   Yeltsin said repeatedly during his election campaign that he
would seek direct ties with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which is
also seeking independence. Today's meeting was his first reported
concrete move to begin establishing those ties.
   Tass said Thursday that deputies of the Moldavian Supreme Soviet,
meeting in the capital, Kishinev, favored the establishment of
direct diplomatic, economic, political and cultural relations with
Lithuania.
   The legislature also proposed to exchange ``permanent missions''
with the Lithuanian parliament, or Supreme Council, Tass said.
   The report did not give vote totals on the measure.
   So far, only Latvia and Estonia have formally acted to cooperate
on such levels with Lithuania. On May 12, the three Baltic republics
revived a 1934 political alliance pledging mutual cooperation.

   The space shuttle Columbia's
astronomy mission is off until at least the week after next while
NASA continues to search for a hydrogen leak in the shuttle's rear
engine compartment.
   ``It doesn't look like we're going to launch next week,'' NASA
spokesman Bruce Buckingham said today. ``It's reasonable to assume,
with the work we have yet to do and the fact that we haven't
isolated the exact location of the leak yet.''
   If workers cannot find the leak, or it cannot be repaired on the
launch pad, Columbia will have to be rolled back to a hangar for a
complete inspection. That would mean a delay of about a month for
the first shuttle mission in five years devoted entirely to
scientific research.
   ``I hope we don't have to roll back, but I can tell you we will
roll back if we have to, if the problem is that serious,'' NASA
administrator Richard Truly said Thursday.
   Workers found a tiny leak in the rear engine compartment
Thursday, but judged it too small to have been the source of the
hydrogen leak that delayed Wednesday morning's launch, Buckingham
said.
   After the launch was scrubbed, officials had said it would take
at least a week _ that is, until next Wednesday _ to find and repair
the leak and prepare for another launch. Now with continuing
problems finding the leak, the launch is off at least until the week
after that, Bukingham said.
   The search continued until late Thursday afternoon, then was
halted so Columbia's on-board fuel tanks could be drained. Officials
today further increased pressure on the shuttle's external tank,
which was drained of fuel and filled with nonflammable helium, to
find the main leak.
   Engineers are now fairly certain the leak is in or near a 17-inch
valve in a pipe that carries fuel from the shuttle's external tank
to its main engines, Buckingham said. Traces of helium were found
early today in a tight cavity between two metal plates that connect
the shuttle and its external tank, he said.
   If the leak is in that cavity, ``It would be an extremely
difficult area to repair at the pad,'' Buckingham said. ``But
nothing at this point has been ruled out.''
   If the leak is not pinpointed today, helium may be circulated
through the shuttle's entire fuel system Saturday, Buckingham said.
The next step would be to use super-cold liquid hydrogen in an
attempt to duplicate the conditions under which the leak was
detected six hours before launch while liquid hydrogen and oxygen
were being loaded.
   Preparations were under way for the liquid hydrogen test, which
is scheduled for the middle of next week, Buckingham said.
   Columbia's astronomy mission, with a $150 million observatory
called Astro, already had been delayed two weeks for repairs to the
shuttle's cooling system.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Samuel Doe, hemmed in by an
advancing rebel army, announced today he will not run for
re-election, and he asked the United States and other nations to
help end his nation's civil war.
   U.S. military officials said 2,100 Marines aboard four ships of
the U.S. Navy's 6th Fleet stood off the Liberian coast to protect
property and lives of Americans and other foreign nationals and, if
necessary, to evacuate people.
   The rebels, from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, are
seeking Doe's ouster. They accuse his administration of corruption,
economic mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   More than 1,000 people have been killed in six months of
fighting, most of them civilians slain by government troops.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor said in an interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday that his fighters would not stop
until they had taken Monrovia, the capital, and formed their own
government.
   Rebel troops already control the country's main port of Buchanan,
95 miles east of the capital, and were advancing on two fronts
within 35 miles of Monrovia. Thousands of people have fled the city.
   At a news conference today, Doe said: ``I wish to announce here
today my firm decision not to stand for the 1991 general elections.''
   ``Accordingly, I hereby appeal to our traditional friends, the
United States government and other friendly counties, to bring to an
end this 6-month-old, Libyan-backed incursion in order to pave the
way for a peaceful, free and fair election in 1991,'' he said.
   The news conference also was attended by legislators who for
months have tried to persuade Doe to not seek another term.
   ``It's too little, too late,'' said one diplomat, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``Six months ago, this might have helped.''
   U.S. Embassy officials said about 2,000 U.S. citizens, including
scores of missionaries and many people of Liberian origin, remain in
the country. Thousands of expatriates fled last month.
   Late Thursday, the U.S. State Department issued a travel advisory
warning that conditions in Liberia were deteriorating and ordering
all non-essential U.S. personnel to leave immediately.
   Cmdr. David Thomas, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said
a U.S. flotilla was off the Liberian coast under orders to ``be
prepared to evacuate American citizens in the event that they would
no longer be able to leave the country by commercial means.''
   Rebel ambushes this week on the road between Buchanan and the
main international airport, 35 miles from Monrovia, have prompted
many airlines to cancel flights.
   Thomas said the flotilla includes a destroyer, an amphibious
assault ship, a tank landing ship and other support vessels carrying
ammunition and combat supplies. Aboard the ships were 179 Marine
officers and 2,102 enlisted men, Thomas said.
   Doe told reporters the U.S. 6th Fleet set sail ``with the
approval of the government of Liberia.''
   He appeared relaxed at the news conference and impervious to the
threat from the advancing rebels. ``Remember that tough times don't
last, only tough people do,'' said Doe, who celebrated his 40th
birthday and 10 years in power this year.
   He sidestepped questions about unruly soldiers who have killed
more than a dozen people in the capital in tribal reprisals against
people of the Gio and Mano tribes. Many of the rebels belong to
those tribes, and Doe's soldiers also are accused of killing
hundreds of Gio and Mano civilians in the countryside.
   ``I am in full control of the army,'' he said.
   U.N. officials were evacuated on Thursday, a day after government
soldiers allegedly attacked the U.N. compound, where 1,000 refugees
from tribes that support the rebels had gathered to seek protection
and safe conduct out of the country.
   U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliani said about eight masked soldiers
killed a guard and abducted about 30 people. The bodies of three
abducted men and a youth were found later dumped outside the capital.
   Doe denied responsibility and said he would punish those
responsible.
   U.N. officials moved all the refugees to a nearby Lutheran Church
compound, where they remained today.
   Doe said his government was discussing with the United Nations
and the Carter Center in Atlanta set up by former President Jimmy
Carter initiatives ``to actively intervene in the restoration of
peace in Liberia and to help us start the process leading to the
election.''
   Doe said he decided not to run for the presidency after the
national legislature this week turned down his request to hold early
elections and set up an interim government.
   Legislators said they wanted Doe to resign.
   Doe said he had survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be
happy to leave the ``burden of leading a country ... the political
harassment'' to somebody else.
   He seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist
descendants of American slaves who discriminated against native
Liberians. Liberia, a country of 2 million, was founded in 1847.
   The current rebellion began Dec. 24 with an invasion of 200
rebels from the Ivory Coast. What started as a minor rebellion
escalated into a war because government attacks against civilians
won the rebels thousands of recruits.
   The West African nation has great strategic importance for the
United States. It is the base for all diplomatic messages to and
from U.S. missions in Africa. There is a huge Voice of America
transmission station a few miles from Monrovia, and the country also
has a powerful Omega marine transmitter responsible for guiding all
U.S. shipping in the Atlantic Ocean.

for the raid.
   Even though the army foiled the attack, killing four guerrillas
and capturing 12, it was viewed as a chillingly narrow escape for
Israeli civilians. Tens of thousands of Israelis had gone to the
coast to swim and picnic on the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
   During a call-in show on army radio, a series of Israelis vented
their feelings. One woman said the soldiers should have killed the
guerrillas instead of capturing them. ``Why don't we just cut them
down for God's sake? Why do I need these murderous terrorists in the
state of Israel where we have to guard over them?''
   Asher Susser, a Middle East expert at Tel Aviv University, said
the attack reflected a basic fallacy in the PLO's strategy _ aiming
its policy toward the United States and Western countries instead of
trying to make Israelis more receptive to Arafat's peace proposals.
   ``It's a radical example of what has been a universal failing in
the PLO leadership,'' he said. ``That is the need to make a serious
effort to see Israeli society as the target of their policy instead
of trying to bring the rest of world opinion crashing down on
Israel.''
   The Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction headed by Mohammed
Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas, claimed responsibility for the
attack. In a statement issued in Baghdad, the front said today that
its targets were only military.
   A prominent Palestinian figure in Jerusalem, Faisal Husseini,
questioned whether the targets were civilian or military but
conceded the impact would ultimately be ``a step backward, a
negative one.''
   The involvement of a PLO faction strengthened the hand of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who immediately called on Washington to
abandon the dialogue it began with the PLO on Dec. 15, 1988.
   The Bush administration has unsuccessfully sought to involve
Israel in talks with a PLO-approved delegation of Palestinians as a
first step toward peace. Shamir objected to any role for the PLO,
even an indirect one.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said on Israel Television, ``I
assume that we won't hear any more from the American administration
about how the PLO is not a terror organization or that Yasser Arafat
has abandoned terror.''
   He made his comments before Arafat said in Baghdad on Thursday
that the PLO was not involved in the attempted attack.
   The White House on Thursday condemned the foiled attack as a
``cowardly attempt to target innocent people.''
   But when asked if the United States was reviewing its dialogue
with the PLO in light of the failed attack, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater replied, ``No, not at this point.''
   The United States opened its dialogue with the PLO after Arafat
renounced terrorism in December 1988.
   Security sources said Israel sent transcripts of interrogations
and other supporting evidence to Washington to prove the intent of
the guerrillas and PLO involvement.
   Israeli officials initially claimed Abbas, who masterminded the
1985 hijacking of the cruise liner Achille Lauro, had met Arafat in
Tunisia five days before the attack.
   However, in an interview published today by the Yediot Ahronot
daily, Israel's top military intelligence chief said Arafat probably
did not know beforehand about the seaborne raid.
   ``We don't have information pointing to the fact that he knew
ahead of time,'' Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak was quoted as saying.
   The extent to which Arafat renounced terrorism is a subject of
debate. In his speech to the United Nations in Geneva in 1988, he
recognized Israel and condemned ``terrorism in all its forms.''
   At the same time, however, he endorsed the 1985 Cairo
declaration, which left open the possibility of hitting military
targets in Israeli-held territory.
   Despite the qualification, a report released by Shamir's
anti-terror adviser, Yigal Carmon, said that the U.S. ambassador
assured Israel that ``no American administration can sustain the
dialogue if terrorism continues by the PLO or any of its factions.''
   The message from the American ambassador at that time, Thomas
Pickering, also said the PLO was required to ``publicly disassociate
yourselves from terrorism by any Palestinian group operating
anywhere.''
   To date, Israeli officials claim PLO groups have been involved in
16 of the attempted 21 acts of terror carried out by Palestinian
groups in Israel since Arafat renounced terrorism. One was a recent
attempt by Arafat's Fatah faction to plant a car bomb on Jerusalem's
Jaffa Road, a major shopping street, they said.
   Yossi Olmert, head of the Government Press Office, said the
attempted raid Wednesday was part of an overall increase in
Arab-Israeli tensions that has developed in recent weeks.
   ``There is an amosphere of war talk and war mongering. If you
start talking about war, you create a climate where there is more
tension than before,'' he said.

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has denied Israeli
allegations that the PLO was involved in an attempted guerrilla
attack on Israel's crowded coastline, but he did not condemn the act.
   Arafat also said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's policies
toward the Palestinians were the main cause of tension in the area.
   ``I have always warned that Israeli violence against my people
will lead to a situation of instability and will lead to
reactions,'' Arafat said Thursday.
   In Washington, the White House rebuffed Israel's plea to end all
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization in the wake of
the attack.
   But White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater condemned the
action, and said: ``We are deeply concerned about the responsibility
for this attack and we are looking into it.''
   Other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed
that no decision had been made on whether to keep talking with the
PLO.
   The Palestine Liberation Front, a PLO faction, claimed
responsibility for the attempted raid Wednesday. Israeli forces
foiled the raid as the guerrillas headed for the Israeli coast in
speedboats. The beaches near Tel Aviv were filled with Israelis
celebrating the Jewish holiday Shavuot.
   The PLF is headed by Mohammed Abbas, also known as Abul Abbas. He
masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the Italian cruise ship Achille
Lauro.
   Asked whether he would expel Abbas from the elected PLO Executive
Committee, Arafat said: ``He was elected in a democratic way by the
Palestine National Council, and only the council has a say on that.''
   Arafat, chairman of the PLO and recognized by Arab countries as
president of a state of Palestine, said ``we are a democratic
organization and decisions should be taken democratically.''
   Israeli officials have urged the United States to suspend its
17-month dialogue with the PLO. They say the raid proved Arafat had
violated his 1988 pledge to renounce terrorism. That pledge led the
United States to open a dialogue with the PLO.
   Israeli officials claim Abbas met Arafat in Tunisia five days
before the attempted raid.
   However, in an interview published today by the Yediot Ahronot
daily, Israel's top military intelligence chief said Arafat probably
did not know beforehand about the seaborne raid.
   ``We don't have information pointing to the fact that he knew
ahead of time,'' Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak was quoted as saying.
   Asked whether he condemned the raid, Arafat told reporters, ``We
in the PLO are not responsible for the operation and we have no
connection with it.''
   Asked again if he could give a flat statement condemning the
raid, Arafat responded, ``What I declared was clear and obvious.''
   Queried another time, he said, ``When I say that we have no
connection with this raid, I mean the PLO forces.''
   Arafat said the raid could be used by Israel as a pretext to
attack Arab countries in retaliation, even though no Israeli
casualties were reported Wednesday. Four Palestinian guerrillas were
killed and 12 were captured.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Wednesday
that if the PLO were behind the attack, the United States would
``view this as a very serious matter.''
   The extent to which Arafat renounced violence is a subject of
debate. In his speech to the United Nations in Geneva in 1988, he
recognized Israel and condemned ``terrorism in all its forms.''
   At the same time, however, he endorsed the 1985 Cairo
declaration, which left open the possibility of hitting military
targets in Israeli-held territory.

   Fifteen to 20 Cuban detainees rioted at a
jail, smashing a wall, setting fires and throwing chunks of concrete
at guards before authorities used tear gas to regain control,
deputies said.
   Two guards and four prisoners suffered minor injuries during the
20-minute melee Thursday at the Avoyelles Parish jail, and about 70
prisoners were treated for inhalation of smoke and tear gas,
deputies said.
   The disturbance, in a dormitory that houses 72 Cuban prisoners
held for the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, began
when one became angry at the guard waking inmates, deputies said.
   During the violence, 15 to 20 of the Cuban inmates smashed a
cinder-block partition wall with metal footlockers, threw pieces of
concrete at guards and ignited the contents of several trash cans,
deputies said.
   The deputy who had been waking up the inmates was temporarily
trapped inside the dorm with the rampaging prisoners, deputies said.
He was hit on the head with a piece of concrete, said the chief
deputy, Maj. Harry Lemoine.
   Chief Detective Bob Venable said the inmates were attempting to
barricade a door leading to the dormitory when deputies used a
canister of tear gas to quell the upheaval.
   Damage to the jail was confined to broken windows and the smashed
wall, Venable said.
   The same dormitory was the site of an intense skirmish involving
Cuban prisoners in June 1988 in which nine deputies and 14 prisoners
were hurt.
   Immigration spokesman Russ Bergeron said the detainees involved
in Thursday's incident came to this country in the ``freedom
flotilla'' boatlift from the Cuban port of Mariel in 1980.
   Some of those refugees were placed in detention because their
immigration status in the United States is in jeopardy because of
crimes. The detainees are awaiting a review of their cases by the
INS and the Department of Justice.
   Mariel Cubans were sent to various parish jails in Louisiana
after the November 1987 riots in the Federal Detention Center in
Oakdale. In eight days of rioting, while 28 employees were held
hostage, much of the $17 million complex was burned down. It was
rebuilt.

   A five-day prison revolt by up to
250 inmates ended today when the mutineers surrendered.
   The revolt started on Monday, as inmates climbed atop a roof at
the Fuhlsbuettel prison to protest conditions there and refused to
move.
   The number of inmates fluctuated during the revolt from a high of
250.
   On Thursday night, 13 inmates remained on the roof after the
others had returned to their cells.
   Tensions rose during the night as some inmates ripped off five
prison doors and started throwing objects around, said Hamburg
Justice Senator Wolfgang Curilla.
   This morning, 80 prison guards wearing protective helmets marched
into the prison and were able to lock up the inmates without any
resistance, said Curilla.
   One inmate stayed on the roof, hurling stones to try to keep
guards away, Curilla said. Eventually, he was forcibly taken away.
   Curilla did not say whether there were any injuries in the revolt.

   Mikhail Gorbachev is pouring on the charm,
disarming critics and admirers with his candor and telling average
Americans on the street he feels ``really at home'' with them
despite U.S.-Soviet differences.
   ``All people,'' he said in one sidewalk exchange Thursday, ``want
a better tomorrow. And the rest is not too important.''
   Whether teasing Henry Kissinger at an embassy lunch, parrying
with reporters at the White House, or spontaneously departing his
motorcade to shake hands with tourists and federal workers,
Gorbachev went about town surprising and delighting his audiences.
   As if summitry were an afterthought, he kept President Bush
waiting at the White House late this morning while he answered
questions from congressional leaders who accepted his invitation for
breakfast at the Soviet Embassy.
   The lawmakers have tried to hold up a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement
until Gorbachev ends a partial economic embargo against Lithuania.
Gorbachev defended his refusal to let the Baltic republic secede
without a popular referendum.
   The Soviet president also explained in great detail his decision
to make people in his homeland embrace a market economy by tripling
the price of bread, one commodity in plentiful supply.
   The televised give-and-take showed Gorbachev willing to engage
American legislators in a forum he has not afforded those in his own
country.
   He made light of his differences with Bush, saying both men were
open to discussion of the issues on which they couldn't agree.
   ``We have a good mutual understanding with the president, even if
sometimes we draw different conclusions,'' he told reporters who had
staked out the White House driveway. ``We both have a willingness to
listen, and so our dialogue is very substantive.''
   ``We want to further our relationship,'' the Soviet president
said.
   Bush, too, was impressed by the man he was meeting as a summit
partner for the second time.
   ``I feel very comfortable with him,'' the American president said
at the end of the first day of their formal talks. ``I feel very
free to bring up positions that I know he doesn't agree with.''
   ``I'm very pleased with that mood of his wanting to understand
the U.S. position,'' Bush added. ``He's not trying to hide anything,
nor is he trying to wring his hands,'' over challenges to his
leadership.
   Gorbachev faces daunting problems at home, with some republics
trying to secede, others torn by ethnic strife, and panicky
consumers stripping store shelves in a stark demonstration of the
lack of confidence in his economic reform plan. But if he has been
weakened by the onslaught or the rise of maverick Boris N. Yeltsin
as a political rival, Bush said it didn't show.
   ``There's a certain strength and confidence that was there in
Malta (in December) and is there now,'' Gorbachev's counterpart
said. ``I don't feel a weakened nature or anything of that nature. I
feel a man who is determined to do his job.''
   ``I believe that it shows that we have not been able for so long
to realize our potential,'' Gorbachev told a luncheon he gave for an
eclectic group of American intellectuals, entertainers, politicians
and public figures. ``We are a huge nation speaking 120 languages,
that means representing 120 nationalities, but that is not all.''
   ``We'll figure out how to proceed in our country,'' he said. ``We
haven't yet done that, but the main thing has been done. ...We have
come to the conclusion that we cannot proceed as we have been doing
all along.''
   He didn't pretend to have all the answers and even admitted
mistakes had been made, but he told his guests at the Soviet
embassy, ``We'll have to travel down this road because we have no
other choice, and the only thing to decide is how rapid our progress
should be.''
   ``Like never before, we want to be understood right now,'' he
said.
   Former Secretary of State Kissinger, whom Gorbachev described as
``my old man who always contests things,'' was just one of several
leading Americans the Soviet leader picked out at the luncheon for
praise or gentle teasing.
   Kissinger later called him ``serene.''
   Having warmed up on a sympathetic audience, Gorbachev invited
some tougher customers to join him on Friday for a suerpower
breakfast.
   Under fire in Congress for his embargo of Lithuania following
that republic's March 11 declaration of independence, Gorbachev
asked at least ten leading members of the House and Senate from both
parties to discuss their concerns with him personally.

   A county commissioner still faces prosecution for
whitewashing alcohol and tobacco billboards in a church-group
protest despite a grand jury's refusal to indict him, the district
attorney says.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said he can prosecute
County Commissioner John Wiley Price on misdemeanor criminal
mischief charges. Grand jurors Thursday declined to issue felony
charges carrying a maximum 10-year prison term.
   Price, who is black, was the only person arrested in a March 18
protest involving at least a dozen people whitewashing billboards in
a predominantly black neighborhood.
   The protest was part of a movement against the targeting of
alcohol and tobacco products at black, Hispanic, female, blue-collar
and inner-city consumers.
   After his arrest, Price defended his actions on television
newscasts. In light of that, Vance said failing to prosecute would
send the wrong message.
   ``He is representative of Dallas _ racist to the core,'' Price
countered. ``If he wants to waste taxpayer money and turn this into
a national trial, then so be it.''
   But Vance said race had nothing to do with it.
   The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum one-year jail term and
would not affect Price's ability to hold office.
   Price said the grand jury's decision not to indict was a
significant victory for opponents of the tobacco and alcohol
industries.
   ``I am ecstatic over the ruling,'' he said. ``The issue is larger
than me, and it's larger than Dallas.''
   Billboard company representatives were not happy.
   ``We hope it doesn't send a message out that the way to beat the
drum for a particular cause is to break the law,'' said George
Reynolds, president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of Dallas.
   Grand jury foreman Otto Fridia declined to comment on the panel's
decision.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev chided
congressional leaders today for linking favored trade status for his
country to Moscow's handling of the Lithuanian drive for
independence.
   At a meeting with a dozen Democrats and Republicans from Capitol
Hill, Gorbachev accused the United States of having a double
standard on intervening in the affairs of other countries. He
pointed to the U.S. invasion of Panama last December.
   ``We have embarked on democratization,'' Gorbachev said. ``We are
changing ... When we hear there is a debate in Congress about our
affairs, this is resented in our society.''
   He called Lithuania's bid for independence, which U.S. lawmakers
have said must be resolved before trade concessions can be granted
to the Soviet Union, ``a matter of sovereignty and national
dignity'' for his country.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, defended the
Panama invasion, saying it was different from Gorbachev's crackdown
in the Baltic because the people in Panama favored the U.S. action.
   But Mitchell did not disagree when Gorbachev noted that President
Bush has been inconsistent by granting unconditional
most-favored-nation status to China, which a year ago brutally
crushed a democracy movement.
   Gorbachev said opening trade channels would be an important
political plus for him as he seeks to restructure the Soviet economy
to a more Western model. He added, ``We cannot wait for Congress and
the congressional leadership to mature. Congress is a problem right
now.''
   But he said he would not beg for concessions and that a sound,
stable Soviet Union is in America's interests.
   ``We hear voices here in America saying ... `maybe the Soviet
Union is so weak that we can defeat him with just one step.' That's
not serious,'' Gorbachev said in televised opening remarks at the
meeting at the Soviet Embassy with congressional leaders.
   ``I'm not going to ask for anything, to beg for anything, even
when I, for example, raise important matters such as trade. And it's
important for us now to expand trade because we are moving toward a
market economy and it's important for us to have the Americans
participating in that process.
   ``But certainly we are not asking for a free ride. We will be
asking for normal credits, and of course we will be paying, and
paying the interest. For us it would humiliating if we were to ask,
to beg for something from you.''
   ``This is a genuine revolution,'' Gorbachev told the lawmakers,
who sat around a long, green-felt-covered table. ``Please don't be
frightened, because you can frighten us, too, if you get
frightened.''
   ``We have to turn around our brains, as it were,'' he said.
``This is a most difficult turnaround to make. Here, too, we hope we
will find a mutual understanding and you will be able to find
certain ways of supporting us, so that we could interact.''
   ``Does the United States want (a) Soviet Union which is weak,
torn by complexes and problems and turmoil? Or do you want a dynamic
Soviet state that is open to the outside world... A realistically
minded person can give only one answer,'' Gorbachev said.
   Among those at the meeting was House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., who stirred a political controversy earlier this
year when he said it was time for the United States to consider
offering direct economic aid to help ensure the success of Gorbachev
and his reforms.
   ``Of course, the president of the United States has the dominant
role in foreign policy,'' Gephardt said in advance of the meeting.
   ``But it is also important for Mr. Gorbachev to hear from members
of Congress. We will be asked to approve trade and arms control
agreements, and we most closely represent the views of the people
who elect us.''
   For Mitchell, the top-ranking lawmaker invited for the session at
the Soviet Embassy, it was chapter 2 in a lively dialogue initiated
with Gorbachev during a visit to Moscow in April.
   A day after that meeting, Gorbachev implemented his economic
squeeze against breakaway Lithuania, a move Mitchell condemned as a
breach of the Soviet president's promise to seek a political
solution with all the Baltic states.
   Mitchell has been a strong proponent of most-favored-nation
trading status for the Soviet Union. But following Gorbachev's
economic crackdown on Lithuania, he helped push through a Senate
resolution, approved 73-24 on May 1, which called on Bush to
withhold a new U.S.-Soviet trade agreement until the sanctions are
lifted and the Kremlin begins negotiations to recognize Lithuania's
independence.
   Those standards are important ``to all Americans who value
freedom and self-determination,'' Mitchell said.
   A trade agreement was proving to be one of the summit's difficult
issues. Soviet spokesman Arkady Maslennikov on Thursday called U.S.
reticence to conclude it ``quite unnatural'' and said it was ``in
nobody's interest'' not to have an agreement.

<TEXT>
   Nothing's official yet, but word that
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev might visit their farm Sunday,
maybe even sit at their picnic table, has the Brand family in
turmoil.
   ``I'm kind of overwhelmed,'' said Greg Brand, 31, who operates
the farm with his parents, Richard and Cecilia, and his 27-year-old
brother, John.
   There was too little notice for the Brands to do a lot of
preparation: about enough time to get the barn cleaned and the lawn
mowed.
   If possible, they'd like to paint the picnic table. That's where
the Brands hope to sit and talk with Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa,
telling them about their family and the farm. The talk would shift
to the kitchen table in the event of rain.
   ``I'll clean the house if I have time,'' said Mrs. Brand, who
learned of the possible visit on Wednesday.
   ``We think of ours as a typical American farm and want to convey
what American farm life is like,'' she said. ``We want to welcome
them here. This is our opportunity to promote some little bit of
international understanding.''
   A farm stop had been suggested for Gorbachev's visit but later
ruled out because he expected to spend only six hours in Minnesota.
The prospect resurfaced Wednesday, however, and state agriculture
officials came up with the Brand farm, in part because it's just 45
minutes from downtown Minneapolis and near the Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport.
   Mrs. Brand said she had been told the Soviet president probably
would arrive at the farm about 6:30 p.m. Sunday, after his meeting
with business and agricultural leaders in downtown Minneapolis. How
long he'll stay isn't clear, but it won't be long.
   Richard and Cecilia Brands have 75 dairy cows and raise alfalfa,
corn and soybeans on the 240-acre farm they've held for 32 years.
   It's a picturesque farm with a large white barn, two white
machine sheds and a two-story white house with black shutters where
the elder Brands live.
   The Brands aren't strangers to the job of entertaining foreign
visitors, and think that may be one reason they were chosen as
potential hosts to the Gorbachevs.
   ``We do have a lot of foreign people who come here. We've had
several Chinese and Japanese and quite a few European groups,'' Mrs.
Brand said. The farm's easy access from the Twin Cities could help
explain why state officials frequently steer visitors her way.
   Despite the farm's proximity to the city, the black and white
Holsteins sunning themselves in a large meadow surrounded by
electric fence present the perfect photo opportunity for a quick
shot of rural America.
   The Gorbachevs, however, would be the first famous visitors.
   All the activity wasn't having much effect on Mrs. Brand's
4-year-old granddaughter, Allison, who was more interested in
playing with the gray kitten that wandered up than with preparations
for the Gorbachev visit.
   ``She just knows that the Russians are coming,'' said her mother,
Brenda Brand.

   Three students were arrested for alleged ties to a

the anniversary of last year's crackdown on the democracy movement,
fellow students said today.
   In another development, Chinese sources said three political
activists who dropped out of sight Thursday were believed to be in
official custody.
   Well-known singer Hou Dejian, university newspaper editor Gao Xin
and scholar Zhou Duo had planned to deliver an open letter to
Chinese leaders appealing for the release of political prisoners,
including university professor Liu Xiaobo. Liu had joined the three
in staging a hunger strike in the final days of last summer's
democracy movement.
   Of the three students arrested May 25, two were undergraduates at
Beijing University and a third was biophysics graduate student Peng
Rong, other students said on condition of anonymity.
   They said Peng's arrest appeared related to a petition he and
several other graduate students put up urging foreign governments to
end economic sanctions.
   The other two students who were arrested were not involved in the
petition. Fellow students identified one as Zheng Guanli of the
economics department but said they did not know the name of the
other one.
   All three were accused of having connections with an underground
group outside Beijing that allegedly has engaged in
counterrevolutionary activities, including distributing leaflets,
fellow students said.
   They said student representatives from each university department
were summoned to a meeting at which school authorities announced
their arrests.
   Communist Party organizations in each department also have met
recently to remind faculty to keep strict order with the approach of
the June 3-4 anniversary of last year's military crackdown on
student protesters.
   Teachers have been told they cannot take students on off-campus
study trips until mid-June, and the school has scheduled several
movies and dances to distract students over the weekend.
   On June 3-4, 1989, army troops backed by tanks shot their way
into Beijing and crushed the student-led pro-democracy movement.
Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of unarmed civilians were killed.
   To maintain social order during the anniversary, security has
been tightened in Beijing and other cities in recent weeks.
   The official press has carried numerous reports in the past week
of arrests of vagrants and petty criminals and executions of
robbers, murderers and rapists as well as an arsonist who set fire
to an army jeep during last year's protests.
   Central Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which was the center of the
democracy movement, will be closed to the public for the next three
days.
   The Beijing Youth News said the square will be filled Saturday
with tens of thousands of children celebrating International
Children's Day.
   On Sunday, authorities plan ``a large activity to commemorate the
150th anniversary of the Opium War,'' the newspaper said without
elaborating.
   And on Monday, June 4, 2,000 taxi drivers will gather on the huge
square with their vehicles for training in preparation for the Asian
Games, to be held in Beijing in September.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, moving
to break a summit stalemate over Germany's future, has proposed that
the military role of a united Germany be decided by a new ``council
of all Europe'' with direct U.S. and Soviet participation, U.S.
sources said today.
   Gorbachev made the proposal to President Bush at their opening
summit session on Thursday, the sources said, and the two leaders
assigned their top diplomatic aides to pursue the concept next week
in Copenhagen, Denmark, and again in Berlin two weeks later.
   ``We are prepared to work with it. It is not something we would
reject out of hand,'' said one U.S. official familiar with the terms
of the Soviet proposal, who spoke only on condition he not be
identified.
   As he began his second day of summit talks with Bush, the Soviet
leader was asked if assigning the German issue to a European council
would allay his concerns about a revival of German militarism.
   ``The president and I are discussing precisely these matters, and
I must say that this is a very substantive discussion, a discussion
in which we are engaged in a spirit of great responsibility and
cooperation,'' Gorbachev replied.
   Gorbachev's plan calls for annual meetings of the leaders of the
35 Western, neutral and Eastern states that make up the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe. There would be more frequent
meetings of their foreign ministers, a permanent secretariat or
administrative staff and creation of military and civilian
``conflict management'' centers.
   Bush and Gorbachev, in effect, agreed to disagree for the
duration of their four-day summit on the military face of a united
Germany, and are directing high-ranking aides to ``meld'' their
concerns.
   U.S. analysts saw Gorbachev's proposal as stemming from his
concerns over the unraveling of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and a
desire to be included more prominently in European consultations.
   ``They are afraid that the process of German unification is
increasing their isolation,'' one U.S. official said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze earlier had
suggested placing a united Germany in both NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
but the U.S. reaction was cool.
   Now Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Shevardnadze will
explore the proposal for a new European council when they attend a
human rights conference in Copenhagen next Tuesday and then at a
meeting in Berlin tentativety set for June 22.
   ``They (the Soviets) want one game in which they are an equal
player,'' said the U.S. official. ``It is not something we are
opposed to in principle. It is an extension of ideas we are prepared
to work with.''
   The European security conference consists of 34 nations and the
Vatican which signed the 1975 Helsinki agreement intended to east
East-West tensions in Europe and promote human rights.
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Bush was speaking to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl by
telephone today to assure him that the U.S. position on the future
of a united Germany is unchanged as a result of the summit talk.
   The White House announced that Bush had invited Kohl to a White
House dinner next Friday. A spokesman said the dinner was arranged
before the summit and was not based on developments over the German
issue.
   The official said Bush would seek to assure Kohl today and at the
dinner next week that the United States supports the position taken
by Kohl, who wants a unified Germany to be part of NATO.
   Meanwhile, Bush and Gorbachev were set to sign a declaration of
basic agreement today to cut their long-range nuclear missiles,
bombers and submarines, to pledge quick consideration of even deeper
cuts and to announce an end to chemical weapons production.
   Bush and Gorbachev exchanged what the Soviet leader called new
approaches on Thursday, and Marlin Fitzwater, the White House
spokesman, said optimistically: ``The ideas presented amount to a
way to meld the concerns of the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   Later, after a state dinner at the White House, National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft said the questions over Germany had produced
``a lively discussion'' at the afternoon meeting between the two
presidents. But ``We're not there yet,'' he said, when asked of
prospects for a breakthrough. ``There's a lot to talk about,
different ways of putting things together.''
   Bush is determined to secure NATO membership for the new Germany
once it is created via the merger of East and West Germany, while
Gorbachev is equally intent on keeping the country out of the
Western alliance or at least restricting the size of the German army.
   ``I hope that we understand each other's concerns better,''
Gorbachev said as he left the White House Thursday.
   ``This exchange of views now requires that our foreign ministers
have a more in-depth discussion,'' he told reporters. ``I think it
is not here that the German question will be resolved.'''
   ``Fundamental positions have not changed,'' Bush said.

<HEAD>Judge: Texas Owes Counties Who House Overflow Of State Inmates</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rossanna is cq in 4th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today ordered the state government
to pay counties $40 a day for each convicted felon they house in
their jails because of overcrowding at the state prison.
   State District Judge Joseph Hart said the state must either take
the prisoners or reimburse the 12 counties who challenged the
state's practice.
   The 12 counties said they are holding some 6,000 felons who have
been sentenced to state prisons. But the Texas prison system is so
overcrowded that there hasn't been room for the felons inside the
state institutions.
   Rossanna Salazar, press secretary to Gov. Bill Clements, didn't
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on the ruling.
The governor in the past has said he opposed paying the counties.
   Ron Dusek, spokesman for attorney general Jim Mattox, said the
state planned to appeal Hart's ruling to the Austin-based 3rd Court
of Appeals.
   Today's ruling affects only those counties that sued the state,
officials said. But it could set a precedent for others to follow,
said Ann Clarke Snell, the lawyer who represented 11 of the counties.
   ``Certainly it seems to me this ruling would be very important to
any county that wanted to go to court and seek similar relief,'' she
said.
   The counties that challenged the state were Nueces, Bexar,
Collin, Dallas, El Paso, Galveston, Hidalgo, Hunt, Lubbock, Tarrant,
Travis and Victoria.
   Statewide, there are an estimated 12,000 convicts awaiting
transfer from all county jails to the Texas Department of
Corrections.
   A federal judge has placed a ceiling on the state prison
population. Several county sheriffs have complained that the backlog
of state prisoners is crowding their jails.
   Hart, in a letter to lawyers in the case that was originated by
Nueces County, said payment to the counties should begin seven days
after an inmate is sentenced to state prison.
   The judge also told lawyers for the counties to calculate how
much the 12 counties already are owed for prisoners they've been
holding in the past.

   BALTICS _ Boris N. Yeltsin promised Lithuania's president that
the vast Russian republic will foster close ties with the
secessionist Baltic region, Lithuanian sources said.
   Yeltsin, who was elected president of the Russian republic on
Tuesday, met with Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis in
Moscow.
   On Thursday, the legislature of Soviet Moldavia voted to
recognize Lithuania's independence, the Tass news agency reported,
making it the first Soviet republic outside the Baltics to do so.
The move by the southwestern republic represented a direct challenge
to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's efforts to isolate Lithuania from the rest
of the Soviet Union.
   Liaonas Asmontas, Lithuania's energy minister, told the
republic's legislature that the energy situation was becoming
critical as a result of the energy blockade imposed by the Kremlin
after the Baltic republic declared itself independent March 11.

   A gondola traveling above a Soviet city broke from
its cable and slammed into a support pole today, hurling its
passengers onto the roof of an apartment building. Twenty people
were reported killed and 15 injured.
   The accident occurred in the republic of Georgia, where the
aerial tramway system carries tourists through downtown Tbilisi and
to a popular nearby tourist attraction, Mount Mtatsminda.
   There were two gondolas on the cable, and the Soviet news agency
Tass said both plunged to the ground. But Iveria, the unofficial
Georgian information agency, and witnesses indicated that only one
car was involved in the accident.
   ``One of the cars seemed to explode,'' said one witness, Graig
Line, an American photographer. ``The car just disintegrated.''
   Iveria said: ``The leading steel cable burst and one of the two
cars started to slide down, accelerating very quickly on the other
cable. Halfway down, the car collided with a support pole and split
in two at full speed.''
   ``The passengers fell out of the car onto the top of a six-story
apartment building and into its yard,'' Iveria said.
   It quoted the Georgian Interior Ministry as saying that at least
20 people died, including several children and soldiers, and that 15
people were injured.
   Tass said ``there is a loss of life'' but did not give a death
toll. It said a government commission was formed to investigate.
   Sergei Dandurov, another witness, said in a telephone interview
that the floor of the cable car appeared to have split open and that
at least 20 people fell to their deaths.

<TEXT>
   The PLO faction that launched this week's
raid along Israel's coast vowed today to keep attacking the Jewish
state, but it claimed its targets were all military.
   The statement was issued by the Palestine Liberation Front in
Baghdad, where it is believed to have its main headquarters. The
group is headed by Mohammad Abbas, who is also known by his nom de
guerre Abul-Abbas.
   He is a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization
executive committee who masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the
Italian cruise ship Achille Lauro. One American was killed on the
ship.
   The Palestine Liberation Front claimed responsibility for the
seaborne guerrilla raid on the Israeli coast on Wednesday.
   In today's statement, the faction said, ``Our valiant naval
forces translated the determination of our Palestinian people to
liberate their national land and escalate armed struggle.''
   Yasser Arafat, chief of the PLO umbrella group, denied
responsibility for the raid but did not condemn it.
   That angered the United States, which opened contacts with the
PLO after Arafat renounced terrorism and recongized Israel's right
to exist.
   PLO officials have said Arafat's declaration renouncing terrorism
did not include attacks on military targets in Israel.
   During Wednesday's seaborne assault, four members of the
Palestine Liberation Front were killed in a gunbattle with soldiers,
and 12 were captured, according to Israeli authorities. No Israelis
were injured, through one craft with raiders landed on a beach near
a crowded club.
   But in its statement today from Baghdad, the Palestine Liberation
Front claimed that only two Syrians and 12 Palestinians took part in
the raid.
   The PLO serves as an umbrella organization for several guerrilla
factions that sometimes fight among themselves and launch
independent attacks on Israeli targets. The largest group is
Arafat's mainstream Fatah.
   Israeli leaders charged that the raid Wednesday proved that
Arafat violated his December 1988 pledge to renounce terrorism.
   But PLO officials insisted that the Arafat pledge was only to
halt attacks on Israeli targets abroad and civilians inside Israel.
The pledge did not include military targets, they said.
   The Front's statement today said its guerrillas did not try to
approach any civilian target inside Israel during the coastal raid.
They said its fighters had instructions to hit military sites only.
The group said its attack was directed at military sites in an area
50 miles wide extending from Herzliyya north of Tel Aviv to Ashqelon
south of Tel Aviv.
   ``As for civilian targets, the naval operation proved that our
combatants avoided approaching them or having any contact with
them,'' the statement said.
   However, Israel claimed maps carried by the guerrillas showed
their targets were civilian beach hotels, crowded with guests on a
religious holiday.

<HEAD>Rebels, Political Parties Agree on Moves to End Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guatemalan rebels and nine political parties
reached agreement today on moves aimed at ending 28 years of armed
conflict in the Central American nation.
   A joint statement released after five days of talks in a hotel
outside Madrid said the rebel Guatamalan National Revolutionary
Union will join the parties in an assembly next year to revise
Guatemala's Constitution.
   The political parties represented at the talks _ including the
Christian Democrats of President Vinicio Cerezo _ accepted the
guerrillas' demand that paramilitary civil patrols be disbanded and
that the armed forces subjected to increased political control.
   In today's statement, the guerrillas pledged not to disrupt
Guatemala's general elections, set for November. However, a rebel
spokesman said this would not mean a general cease-fire in the
fighting.
   The statement was released at a news conference after closed-door
talks in El Escorial, 25 miles north of Madrid.
   The agreement is expected to serve as a framework for future
negotiations among the guerrillas, Cerezo's government and top
military officers.
   Before then, the guerrillas are likely to open talks with
representatives of Guatemalan trade unions, businessmen and the
Roman Catholic Church, a rebel spokesman said this week.
   The Guatemalan conflict, set off by rebel army officiers in 1962,
has claimed between 30,000 and 60,000 lives, according to government
estimates.
   The rebels say 100,000 people have died and that 50,000 are
missing.
   A first round of peace talks held in 1987 in Madrid ended in
deadlock.
   This week's negotiations were moderated by the six-member
National Reconciliation Council, headed by Guatemala Archbishop
Rodolfo Quesado. U.N. official Francesc Vendrell attended the
meeting as an observer.
   Three rebel leaders took part in the negotiations, including
veteran guerrilla chief, Rodrigo Asturias, also known by the code
name Cmdr. Gaspar.
   The party leaders included former Guatemalan vice-president Mario
Sandoval, founder of the ultra-conservative National Liberation
Movement.
   The negotiations form part of a process begun after the 1987
Esquipulas II Central American peace accords. The region's five
presidents agreed that conflicts in their Central American nations
should be ended through democratic reforms and political
negotiations between governments and rebel movements.
   The United States has expressed support for the Guatemalan talks.

   A tanker carrying 375,000 gallons of fuel oil
ran aground today in the Delaware River but was refloated a few
hours later without any apparent leaks, authorities said.
   The Norwegian tanker Manhattan Princess, operated by Ahlers
Shipping of Belgium, grounded on a muddy bottom on the New Jersey
side of the river at 12:45 a.m. today, said Coast Guard Lt. Pete
Hoffman.
   Coast Guard Lt. Pete Hoffman said two tugboats pulling on the
tanker got it off the bottom with little trouble after high tide
arrived about 9:15 a.m. Investigators found no leakage or ship
damage, he said.
   The ship, drawing 37 feet of water, was en route to the Hess
terminal in Pennsauken, N.J., when it wandered out of the 40-foot
deep channel. An investigator went along with the tanker to look
into the cause of the grounding, Hoffman said.
   The ease of refloating the tanker was an indication that the
tanker wasn't very hard aground on the soft, muddy bottom, Hoffman
said, and it also suggested that there wouldn't be any damage to the
hull.

<TEXT>
   The doctor of the late free-love guru
Osho Rajneesh claimed Friday that he has discovered a cure for
soccer hooliganism: screaming.
   Swami Amrito, a British physician, said if soccer fans screamed
for 10 minutes before and after every match, there would be no
reason to worry about violence.
   ``All that's needed to stop the rising tide of soccer hooliganism
around next month's World Cup match in Italy is that all soccer fans
should have a good catharsis,'' Amrito said, according to a press
release issued by the Rajneesh commune in Poona. Amrito said players
should also participate in the ``screaming meditation.''
   ``That will reduce the violence on the field as well as encourage
some poetry and grace in their play,'' he said.
   Amrito has been one of the leaders of the Rajneesh commune since
the guru, who was once known as Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, died in
January.
   Rajneesh preached a philosophy of quick-fix enlightenment,
telling his followers that only through the indulgence of sensual
pleasures could one achieve ``inner peace.''
   He was expelled from the United States in 1985 for violating
immigration laws. At one time his group operated a huge commune in
Oregon.

   Thousands of children danced and sang on Tiananmen
Square on Friday for Premier Li Peng and other Chinese leaders who
ordered the military sweep of student activists on the square one
year ago.
   Some 10,000 children were bused into the symbolic political
center of China to mark International Children's Day.
   It was one of the biggest organized gatherings on the square
since last June, when university students led huge pro-democracy
rallies with crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands.
   Speakers this year said it was due to the army's action in
crushing the ``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' that the children
were able to have their festive day on the square.
   Annual Children's Day activities on Tiananmen were cancelled last
year because the square was occupied by student demonstrators. The
military moved in on June 3-4, killing hundreds and perhaps
thousands of people as they drushed the pro-democracy campaign.
   Hundreds of police patrolled the square Friday. Foreign
journalists were subjected to tight security checks because of the
appearance of China's top two officials, Premier Li and Communist
Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin.
   Around the monument to revolutionary martyrs in the center of the
square, large balloons lofted streamers reading ``long live the
great Communist Party'' and ``long live our great socialist
motherland.''
   Stress on ideological training has increased dramatically since
the government crushed the democracy movement. Young people in
particular are constantly being reminded that they must remain loyal
to the party and the socialist system.
   Thousands of doves were released over the square to open the
ceremonies.

   The top administrator of strife-torn
Punjab state resigned Friday after less than six months in office,
news reports said.
   Gov. Nirmal Kumar Mukarji submitted his resignation to President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman, United News of India reported.
   Mukarji, who took office on Dec. 8 last year, did not give any
reason for the resignation, the news agency said. However,
newspapers have been saying for some days a change was imminent
because Mukarji has been largely ineffectual in controlling the Sikh
insurgency sweeping the state.
   The Statesman newspaper reported Friday that Mukarji would be
replaced by P.K. Kaul, a former top-ranking bureaucrat who has also
served as India's ambassador to the United States.
   However, Press Trust of India quoted an unnamed government
spokesman as saying no decision had been taken about Mukarji's
replacement.
   At least 980 people have been killed in the state this year by
Sikh militants' hit-and-run attacks and bombings. The militants are
demanding an independent state because of what they call
discrimination against Sikhs by Hindus, India's majority community.
   Sikhs are in a slight majority in Punjab but form only 2 percent
of India's 880 million people. Hindus make up 82 percent.

<HEAD>Council Threatening Eviction Over Satellite Dishes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A municipal council in south London is threatening
to evict public housing tenants who refuse to remove satellite TV
dishes from their homes.
   ``We don't like this architectural acne erupting all over the
borough,'' said Sutton council spokesman Howard Spencer.
   Nationally, some 700,000 dishes have been installed to receive
the Sky television channels, owned by Rupert Murdoch's The News
Corporation, according to the Financial Times of London. A rival
service, British Satellite Broadcasting, entered the market this
year.
   Nearly 100 local authorities are pressing the government to stop
the growth of satellite dishes, but the Sutton council is the first
to take such a step.
   Sutton council said Thursday that 150 public housing tenants who
had installed the dishes on outer walls violated tenancy agreements
forbidding alterations to the buildings.
   If tenants want to receive satellite TV, Spencer said, they could
place free-standing dishes in their gardens or on balconies.
   Legislators said they would give people 28 days to remove the
dishes.
   ``We don't want to see people out on the street, but we want to
protect our property,'' Spencer said.

   Maj. Gen. Ronald Fogelman, who flew 240
combat missions in Vietnam, has been named commander of the U.S. 7th
Air Force based in South Korea, officials said Friday.
   Fogelman is expected to take over his new post in July, moving
from an assignment at the Pentagon in Washington, Air Force
officials said.
   The 7th Air Force is based at Osan, 30 miles south of Seoul, and
includes about 10,000 airmen and support personnel.
   Fogelman is a 1963 graduate of the Air Force Academy and has had
assignments in West Germany and the Netherlands.

   Someone set a fire early today in a storage
room on the luxury liner Regent Star, five days after the ship ran
aground in Delaware Bay because of another fire that cut off power,
authorities said.
   No passengers were aboard and no injuries were reported in the 5
a.m. blaze, which was controlled within 90 minutes, said Patrick
McKee, a dispatcher for the city fire department.
   ``The fire on the Regent Star was started in a maintenance
storage room,'' said Lt. Jack Christmas, a fire department
spokesman. ``The fire marshal investigating has determined ... that
the fire was intentionally set.''
   There were no immediate suspects and no immediate evidence to
indicate that the fire was linked to the earlier fire, Christmas
said.
   The 20,000-ton liner was on its way from Jamaica to Philadelphia
on Sunday when a small fire prompted a power loss, allowing the ship
to drift onto a sandbar.
   The 885 passengers left the ship by ferry Monday, a day after
they were supposed to return. No one was injured.
   The liner was freed Tuesday, and the ship was then docked while
the Coast Guard makes safety checks. Thursday, Coast Guard Petty
Officer Ken Beatty said the ship passed all inspections and there
was no serious damage from the grounding.
   The ship had been due to start on a two-day cruise later today,
but that was canceled after the second fire broke out, authorities
said.
   The Coast Guard has said it might be months before a final report
on the grounding is complete.
   An hour after this morning's fire was controlled, about 300 crew
members sat or stood in small groups alongside the Port of History
Museum where the ship was tied up. Many still wearin the orange life
preservers they had put om when they abandoned the ship. Others were
sitting on the preservers.
   Many of them said they didn't speak English, and one who did
refused to be identified and said he didn't know anything about what
happened.

   A 72-year-old error in the naming of
Flutter Road will go unfixed.
   The Allen County Commissioners declined to change the name from
Flutter to Fletter even though 75 people who live along the road
signed a petition favoring Flutter.
   Leonard and Harold Fletter argued that a clerical error on a 1918
petition to the commissioners caused the }-mile road in St. Joseph
Township to be called Flutter instead of Fletter. It was supposed to
have been named after their ancestor, Samuel C. Fletter, who owned a
farm there and donated adjacent land for a school.
   But residents said they don't want to be troubled with having to
change stationery and legal documents. The commissioners went along
with them at their Tuesday night meeting.
   Resident Orlyn Myer used alliteration to get his point across in
a letter to the commissioners.
   ``After finding the flap about Flutter from the Fletter families
from Fort Wayne and Florida, I felt like flipping,'' wrote ``the
father of a Flutter Road family.''
   He concluded: ``If, by chance, Mr. Fletter can find the funds to
fetch a secretary for me and finance the stamps to fix upon the
envelopes to change all of ... (his personal) records, I might
reconsider the decision. Otherwise, after nearly 72 years, why not
leave well enough alone?''

   Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos was
recovering today from a stomach inflammation that halted her fraud
trial when she collapsed in the courtroom and coughed up blood.
   The judge in the trial disposed of a side issue by quashing a
subpoena seeking testimony from television journalist Diane Sawyer
about a ``60 Minutes'' interview with Mrs. Marcos.
   He said he was not persuaded that the material was necessary
enough to the prosecution to overcome objections by CBS, which did
not want to turn over cartons of outtakes and related material to
the defense. The judge had told lawyers of his decision Thursday and
issued a written opinion today.
   Mrs. Marcos remained at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center,
where she was taken by ambulance Thursday. She was diagnosed with
erosive gastritis, which is caused when stomach acid erodes the the
organ's lining, said Jonathan Weil, a hospital spokesman. He said
Mrs. Marcos was treated with intravenous antacid.
   ``Mrs. Marcos' condition is much improved and she is
stabilized,'' Kathy Robinson, another hospital spokeswoman, said
today. ``The abdominal pain that she was experiencing is no longer
present and if she remains stabilized, her doctors will probably
allow her to go home on Sunday in care of her personal physician.''
   Mrs. Marcos' chief attorney, Gerry Spence, had just completed his
cross-examination of Robert Shaheen, a former chief aide to Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi, when Mrs. Marcos suddenly slumped in her
chair, lay her head on the table and coughed up blood into a black
handkerchief.
   Mrs. Marcos' sudden illness threw U.S. District Court into a
tumult.
   ``When I saw her face and throwing up blood, I thought she was
going to die right there in the courtroom,'' said another of her
lawyers, Benjamin Cassiday, who was seated next to her.
   Attorneys and doctors rushed to her side. Judge John F. Keenan
dismissed the jury and called a recess until Tuesday.
   ``It was very sad. I never saw so much blood come out of
someone,'' said Kashoggi, Mrs. Marcos' co-defendant, who was seated
at another table about 10 feet away.
   It was the third time in five weeks that Mrs. Marcos, 60, had
fallen ill during the trial. On the other two occasions, doctors
said her blood pressure shot up alarmingly.
   Dr. David Case, an internist who has been treating Mrs. Marcos
for high blood pressure, said Thursday's illness appeared unrelated
to that condition or to medication she has been taking.
   Case said there were numerous possible causes, including stress.
   Defense lawyers said it was too soon to know how the illness
might affect the trial, which began March 20.
   Mrs. Marcos faces charges of racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   She is accused of helping her husband, the late Philippines
President Ferdinand Marcos, steal about $220 million from their
nation's treasury, using the money for their own purposes, including
the secret purchase of artwork and four New York office buildings.
   Khashoggi faces charges of faking documents to show that he, not
the Marcoses, owned the properties before the Marcoses' assets were
frozen by a U.S. court order.

   The government is exerting strong pressure on labor movements to
not strike during the World Cup, which begins June 8.
   Air controllers called off strikes scheduled for June 4-6.
Railway workers, members of splinter unions that are increasingly
challenging the established labor federations, said they were

acted after Transport Minister Carlo Bernini said he was ready to
negotiate with them.

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with restrictions at U.S. base, report

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials today imposed new
restrictions on American troops at Clark Air Base because of a
security threat in the area where Communist rebels killed two airmen
last month.
   Maj. Gen. Cesar Nazareno, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
said he ordered heightened security patrols because of the Communist
threat.
   He said he was also honoring a U.S request to let American troops
accompany Philippine forces providing security outside the bases in
``areas where there are visible American targets.''
   He said the request came from Rear Adm. Roger Lee Rich, commander
of the Subic base 50 miles west of Manila. But there was no
confirmation from U.S. officials.
   In 1987, U.S. troops joined Filipino police in off-post patrols
after the slaying of three Americans near Clark Air Base. However,
the arrangement raised an uproar from Filipinos who considered the
patrols a breach of sovereignty.
   Also today, President Corazon Aquino said she will not seek a
congressional extension of her emergency powers, which expire June
8. However, she left open the option of calling a special
legislative session if she changes her mind.
   The emergency powers include the authority to control prices and
increase state regulation of utilities, transport and vital
industries.
   The Philippine Congress approved the powers following a coup
attempt led by rebel soldiers in December. It was one of six coup
attempts aimed at toppling her struggling government.
   In another development, a newspaper reported today that
authorities are investigating a report that a professional killer
from Los Angeles may have entered the country last month to
assassinate the president.
   At Clark Air Base, spokesman Lt. Col. Ron Rand, said today's
regulations prevent U.S. troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents from leaving the bases except on essential
business.
   ``Local, current conditions dictate we take action right now,''
Rand said in an announcement broadcast by the U.S. military's
television station.
   He did not elaborate, but the announcement came one week after
U.S. officials relaxed similar restrictions imposed because of the
May 13 killings of the two U.S. airmen outside the base.
   After the killings, military personnel at Clark and the other
five American installations in this country were barred from leaving
the bases, except on essential business. On May 25, U.S. officials
announced that troops were allowed off-post between 7 a.m. and 7
p.m. But they were told to stay within a half mile of the gates.
Rand said that ``local liberty'' has now been suspended until
further notice.
   The new measures apply to the 20,300 troops, U.S. civilian
employees and dependents at Clark, he said.
   Clark Air Base, one of the largest American garrisons abroad, is
located 50 miles north of Manila in a stronghold of the Communist
New People's Army.
   The Communists are waging a 21-year insurgency to establish a
Marxist state. They have vowed to continue attacking Americans until
all U.S. troops leave the Philippines.
   In its report today, the nationally circulated Philippine Daily
Inquirer quoted police sources as saying a 50-year-old, unidentified
professional killer arrived in the country from the United States
last month and was to have attempted the assassination of Mrs.
Aquino sometime between May 15 and 20.
   But the plot was discovered through a tip from an informant in
San Francisco, the newspaper said. The assassin is still believed to
be in the country, it said. The newspaper did not specify which
group reportedly hired the would-be killer.
   Col. Voltaire Gazmin, chief of Mrs. Aquino's security force,
confirmed receiving a report during the second week of May of an
assassination plot but said the information had not yet been
verified. He gave no further details about the alleged plot.
   Mrs. Aquino and other government officials played down the report.
   ``I face the same risks as any president normally does and our
security has been equal to the task,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a
statement today.

   Cambodian guerrillas have launched
major attacks and seized areas of several provinces in recent days
as Cambodia's warring factions prepare to meet next week to discuss
a cease-fire.
   Guerrilla leaders and diplomats say the Khmer Rouge have made the
most substantial gains, but the pro-Hanoi government of Prime
Minister Hun Sen has also been active on the battlefields.
   Leaders of the three-party guerrilla coalition, which includes
the communist Khmer Rouge, are to meet with Hun Sen in Tokyo on
Monday and are expected to announce a cease-fire in the 11-year-old
war.
   Sources say the Khmer Rouge launched a series of coordinated
attacks in Kompong Speu, Siem Riep, Kompong Thom and Battambang
provinces in recent days. The provinces are in northwestern,
northern and central Cambodia.
   The Khmer Rouge captured the district seat of Roluos in Siem Riep
Province earlier this week and have established front-line positions
only 3.6 miles from the provincial capital, according to senior
resistance and Thai intelligence officials.
   ``There has been heavy fighting recently, and the Khmer Rouge
seem to be coming out on top,'' said a senior Thai intelligence
official.
   Fighting in Kompong Speu province has forced government offices
to suspend foreign relief projects there, according to Western
relief workers returning to Thailand from Phnom Penh, the Cambodian
capital.
   Guerrilla and diplomatic sources say the Khmer Rouge now control
large sections of the province and maintain truck supply routes all
the way to the Thai border. Kompong Speu city is 24 miles southwest
of Phnom Penh.
   Diplomats say increased fighting is expected this month as the
rainy season terrain favors guerrilla advances. In the past, the
warring sides have also stepped up fighting before peace
negotiations to gain leverage.
   The Thai intelligence official said it made sense for the Khmer
Rouge to make a military move before the Tokyo talks.
   Thai intelligence sources and diplomats say the Khmer Rouge are
against a cease-fire agreement until there is an international
verification of the pullout of Vietnamese forces from Cambodia.
   Vietnam claimed it pulled the last of its soldiers from Cambodia
in September, but the guerrillas claim some remain.
   The Khmer Rouge are joined in a resistance coalition with
followers of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former head of
state, and the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   The Khmer Rouge were in power in Cambodia in 1975-1978. They were
ousted after Vietnam invaded in late 1978 and set up a pro-Hanoi
government.
   The Tokyo meeting is expected to include announcement of a
cease-fire; reconvening of a Paris peace conference that ended in
failure last year; and the formation of a Supreme National Council.
The council would include all four warring factions and be charged
with monitoring a cease-fire.
   But guerrilla officials say there are no provisions for enforcing
or monitoring a cease-fire, and they are pessimistic it can be
effectively implemented on the battlefield.
   ``So far, they can't even agree on seating arrangements in
Tokyo,'' said a Thai official involved in the preparations. ``Hun
Sen wants to sit across from Sihanouk, but the Khmer Rouge and the
KPNLF won't accept this.''

<TEXT>
   New York's new lunchtime order: Make it a ham on
rye _ and hold the streptococci.
   So advises City Council President Andrew Stein, who said Thursday
that all but two of a dozen take-out lunches he had tested at a
private laboratory were contaminated with illegal levels of bacteria.
   Stein, whose aides collected each sample at a different
restaurant, blamed a lack of inspections by the Health Department.
The possible result: deli belly, the nausea, cramps and diarrhea
caused by eating tainted food.
   Toxic tortillas? Lethal lunchmeat?
   Baloney! Health Commissioner Woodrow Myers Jr. responded. He
called it ``categorically untrue'' for Stein to suggest that the
public was endangered by lax enforcement.
   While the restaurant inspection staff remains smaller than
desired, Myers said, it is being increased and all complaints are
followed up. He noted that the city has not experienced an increase
in food poisoning reports.
   Myers also said he had ``serious questions'' about the scientific
value of Stein's study. Among other problems, he suggested that
Stein's aides themselves could have contaminated the food, and he
said the laboratory tests were simply for bacteria in general,
rather than for those bacteria that cause illness.
   Stein, the city's chief ombudsman, also recently reported finding
bug parts in imported packaged foods he had tested. Federal
inspection officials said the particles he'd found didn't really
threaten anyone.
   Thursday, Stein described his restaurant sampling as ``random,''
saying his aides simply picked up lunches at Manhattan eateries that
appeared to them to be representative. He declined to identify the
establishments, saying that would be unfair, but sent their names to
the Health Department.
   ``I believe that there are hundreds, probably thousands of
establishments that have the same problem,'' he said. ``If you don't
have enforcement, and you don't have inspections, then you're going
to have problems.''
   Stein noted that the Health Department fired many of its
inspectors in a bribery scandal three years ago, and regular
inspections have yet to resume.
   ``Common sense will tell you that if the establishments know that
they're not ever getting inspected on any regular basis, then
they're going to be more lax than if they are getting inspected,''
he said. ``The city has a duty here to do some regular inspections.''
   Myers, at his own news conference, said the city has 15 food
inspectors working now and 43 in training who will be available
Sept. 1. He said his department was checking the restaurants that
Stein named, but noted that four of them are markets that fall under
state, not city, jurisdiction.
   ``The Health Department is not lax when it comes to food
safety,'' he said. ``While we question Mr. Stein's laboratory
results and refute his conclusions, we are, nonetheless,
investigating the food establishments in question.''

   Construction spending fell 0.7 percent in April
for the second consecutive month, the government said in a report
that analysts said signalled a weakening building industry.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $432.4 billion in April. The revised 0.7 percent
March decline was improved from the 1.4 percent drop first reported
last month.
   The decreases in March and April spending followed gains of 3.2
percent in February and 2.4 percent in January and resulted in the
loss of 159,000 construction jobs.
   ``We had strong construction employment in the first quarter when
we had great weather,'' David F. Seiders, chief economist for the
National Association of Home Builders, said. ``But if you look at
the next two months, that's really quite a decline.''
   The construction spending report ``combined with the employment
numbers are two more signals of a pretty sluggish economy,'' Seiders
said.
   Two other reports portend further weakening. The government
overall job figures released Friday showed the unemployment rate
fell to 5.3 percent in May as weak job growth continued. The Labor
Department reported 20,000 more construction jobs were lost in the
month.
   And on Wednesday, the F.W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill Inc.
reported that contracts for new construction declined 6 percent in
April, a four-year low.
   Analysts attribute the construction slump to high interest rates
and tighter restrictions on lending.
   Residential building edged down 0.3 percent to an annual rate of
$202.7 billion after rising 2 percent in March, even better than the
1.8 percent increase first reported last month.
   Single-family building dropped 2.2 percent to an annual rate of
$120 billion after a 1.2 percent increase in March. Apartment
construction, on the other hand, rose 6 percent to $21 billion. It
had dropped 4.3 percent in March.
   With mortgage rates in the double-digits and sales of new homes
declining, residential construction ``is destined to keep going
down,'' Seiders said, adding that the jump in multi-family building
was an aberration.
   ``The multi-family sector has been really weak and sliding for
some time and will resume its downward path next month,'' he
predicted.
   Non-residential construction such as office and industrial
buildings edged up 0.6 percent to $104.2 billion after rising 2.4
percent in March.
   The volatile government sector fell for the second straight
month, down 3.5 percent to $87.6 billion. Highways and streets
spending paced the drop with a 8.2 percent decline.
   Government construction spending had fallen 4.9 percent in March
after gaining 5.2 percent in February.
   Overall construction spending in April was 5 percent above that
of the same month in 1989, when it totaled $411.9 billion.

<HEAD>Segregation of All Public Amenities to End by October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The white minority government
introduced legislation Friday to remove one of the pillars of
apartheid, racial segregation of public amenities such as parks,
libraries and bathrooms.
   The Separate Amenities Act, passed in 1953, has granted
provincial governments, municipalities and privately owned
entertainment establishments the right to reserve facilities for
whites.
   A bill that would repeal the act was published Friday and is
expected to be passed in mid-June, the South African Press
Association reported. It was the latest move by the government of
President F.W. de Klerk to dismantle apartheid.
   The Conservative Party, the largest white opposition party, is
the only parliamentary group expected to oppose the bill, but the
party does not have enough votes to block it.
   Hernus Kriel, minister of provincial affairs and planning, said
the bill would not take effect until Oct. 15, to give those affected
time to prepare.
   The bill would remove local governments' authority to racially
segregate public facilities such as libraries, toilets, parks and
buses. It also would remove the legal protection of individuals who
want to reserve restaurants, hotels, resorts and other public
facilities for whites.
   In most major cities, such as Johannesburg and Cape Town, public
amenities have been desegregated in recent months. But in hundreds
of smaller cities, towns and villages, there are either no public
facilities for blacks in the city centers, or there are inferior,
separate amenities.
   The Separate Amenities Act is considered one of the pillars of
apartheid, the system of racial separation and white domination
encoded in law by the National Party when it came to power in 1948.
   Other pillars are the Population Registration Act, which
classifies every South African by race; the Group Areas Act, which
establishes racially segregated neighborhoods; the Land Act, which
reserves most of the country for white ownership; and the voting
laws, which place political power in the hands of the white minority
by denying a national vote to the black majority.
   De Klerk has said he intends to end apartheid and give blacks an
equal vote with whites by 1994 under a system he hopes to negotiate
with black leaders.
   However, de Klerk opposes one-person, one-vote majority rule, and
instead suggests a system where cultural, social and ethnic groups
would be assured representation in the government.
   Since taking office last year, de Klerk has legalized dozens of
outlawed black political organizations, freed scores of political
prisoners, and ordered hospitals integrated.
   The Conservative Party and white extremist organizations have
denounced de Klerk's actions as treason to the white Afrikaners who
control the government. Some have said they will protect apartheid
by force, if necessary.
   The complications of changing 42 years of practice are reflected
in the amount of time it will take to repeal the Separate Amenities
Act if the national legislature votes to do so. Hundreds of local
ordinances may have to be repealed to comply with the national law,
and Conservative-controlled municipalities can be expected to resist
any changes.
   Upholding the new law will also depend on government employees,
many of whom support the Conservative Party or generally oppose the
rapid changes taking place in South Africa.
   Two weeks ago, Health Minister Rina Venter announced that
segregation of all hospitals had ended. However, this week, the
administrator of the country's 44 white hospitals said whites would
still be given preference of admission because the hospitals were
meant to serve the local community.
   Although segregation at government-owned resorts and recreation
areas was officially ended months ago, blacks, Indians and people of
mixed-race continue to be turned away. In recent cases, resort
administrators, who are government employees, say they haven't
received direct orders to admit people who are not white.

   Residents and witnesses said three funnel
clouds didn't quite touch down but still caused $5.5 million worth
of damage, while the weather service says one tornado did scour the
surface.
   No injuries were reported, but about 80 percent of the city was
blacked out and phone service was spotty until this morning.
   ``There was one that hit Spearman itself, and there were multiple
tornadoes in the vicinity of Spearman for several hours last
night,'' said Steven Cooper of the National Weather Service office
in Amarillo. ``There were about three different storm systems. Two
dropped tornadoes.''
   The funnel clouds were ``too numerous to count,'' he said.
   State Trooper Wayne Beighle of Amarillo said 10 twisters were
spotted in the area Thursday night.
   ``We were up there until 1:00 (a.m.), and there were still
tornadoes dancing around. They were all over the place,'' Beighle
said. ``None touched the ground _ they were hovering just above the
ground, but that was enough to do the damage.''
   Ten mobile homes and 10 houses were reported destroyed, Beighle
said.
   Some of the mobile homes were ``smoothed off to the ground,''
said Mayor Burl Buchanan.
   The mayor estimated that 5 percent of the town of 3,500 had
property damage. He said early warning gave people time to take
shelter and prevented injuries.
   ``It could have been a lot worse,'' he said.
   A church was demolished and a barbecue restaurant was seriously
damaged.
   The storm ``blew the porch off and blew it back on top of the
building. It just flipped it up and laid it up on top of the roof,''
Buchanan said.
   Many homes had damaged windows and roofs, and some power lines
were reported down. Buchanan said tree limbs and one mobile home
needed to be cleared from streets to make them passable.

   Boris N. Yeltsin promised Lithuania's president
Friday that he would foster close ties between the huge Russian
republic he now heads and the secessionist Baltic region, Lithuanian
sources said.
   Yeltsin's offer openly defied Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, who ordered a partial economic blockade against Lithuania
in an effort to force it to back off its March independence
declaration.
   Yeltsin, who was elected president of the Russian Federation on
Tuesday, met with Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis for ``a
very friendly talk with full mutual understanding,'' said Natasha
Boganova, secretary of the Lithuanian representation in Moscow.
   ``Yeltsin is prepared, as soon as Russia gets its sovereignty, to
cooperate fully with the Baltic republics, and Lithuania first of
all,'' she said.
   Lithuania, struggling to circumvent the Kremlin blockade, has
been seeking direct ties with newly elected radical leaders in
various parts of the country.
   On Thursday, the legislature of the republic of Moldavia
recognized Lithuania's independence, the official Tass news agency
reported. It was the first Soviet republic outside the Baltics to do
so.
   Gorbachev has said Lithuania must suspend its declaration of
independence before he will lift the economic blockade and begin
talks with Lithuanian leaders. Lithuanian lawmakers have offered
compromise measures but balked at suspending the declaration.
   Yeltsin has said he expects the Russian parliament to declare the
Russian Federation's sovereignty within the first 100 days of his
term. The Russian Federation is the Soviet Union's largest republic,
with two-thirds of its territory and just over half its population.
   Sovereignty would mean republic authorities would have final say
over which Soviet laws are valid on Russian territory, and greater
independence in general from the national government, including on
economic issues.
   If Russia were to resume supplying Lithuania with natural gas,
oil and other raw materials, it would mean the virtual end of the
Kremlin's sanctions _ without Gorbachev's consent.
   But even if such an accord could be worked out, it might not be
soon enough for the Lithuanians, who are pressing to find alternate
sources of gas and oil before they run out entirely.
   About 46,000 people have been laid off and eight factories closed
because of the blockade, Lithuanian radio has reported. Many
residents of Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, have been without hot
water for weeks.
   Lithuanian radio reported that Poland will begin supplying the
republic with cooking oil and sugar _ at steeper prices than Soviet
suppliers commanded.
   In neighboring Latvia, which declared May 4 that it had begun its
move toward independence, rationing of several food staples began
Friday, Tass said.
   The Kremlin has not extended its economic sanctions to Latvia,
but residents fearing a blockade began panic-buying after the May 4
declaration.
   Yeltsin said repeatedly during his election campaign that he
would seek direct ties with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, which is
also seeking independence. Friday's meeting was his first reported
concrete move to begin establishing those ties.
   All three Baltic republics were forcibly annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel, speaking at a Stockholm news
conference, said Yeltsin's election ``is important to the political
life in the whole of the Soviet Union and is certain to influence
the situation in the Baltic region.''
   Despite his defiance of Gorbachev's economic sanctions, Yeltsin
told reporters Friday he still hoped to meet with the Soviet leader
soon to resolve their differences, Tass reported.
   ``We have got to meet and discuss important questions,'' Tass
quoted Yeltsin as saying during a break in the Russian Congress. ``I
am prepared to go a good part of the distance toward Gorbachev,
throwing aside everything personal that has piled up recently. I
hope that he, too will cover part of the road.''
   Yeltsin noted that he had not met personally with Gorbachev for
more than a year.
   Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to head the Moscow Communist Party
committee, but the two men clashed in late 1987 over the pace of
reforms and have attacked each other's positions publicly ever
since. They also appear to bear personal grudges against each other.
   Gorbachev actively opposed Yeltsin's election to the Russian
presidency.
   There have been no reports that Gorbachev has sent Yeltsin
congratulations on his election.

   Two students were arrested and charged
with mischief after they sailed paper airplanes at the teachers'
section during high school graduation ceremonies, authorities said.
   Livingston High School officials requested the charges and
arrests may be made, Chief Deputy Sheriff Willie Graves said
Thursday.
   ``Everything went beautifully until almost the end,'' said
assistant principal Frances LaFleur. ``I was calling out names, and
Principal Owen Norgess was handing out diplomas.
   ``A gentleman in the balcony stood up and blasted an air horn,
not once, but twice. Then the students threw the paper airplanes at
the teachers' section. Two hit a teacher. His face turned blood red,
and he was very embarrassed.
   ``All the faculty was outraged and upset over the lack of
respect.''
   Jared S. Vicknair, 17, and David D. Wallace, 18, were released on
$500 property bonds, accused of throwing airplanes during the May 25
ceremonies.
   Jonnie Drago Jr., 43, Wallace's uncle, was charged with
disturbing the peace by blowing the air horn, Graves said.

   Barbara Bush, in a commencement speech
clouded by controversy over women's roles in modern American life,
exhorted Wellesley College graduates today to put friends and family
first in their lives, whatever careers they pursue.
   She was joined at the women's college graduation by Raisa
Gorbachev, who delivered her own words of advice to the 575
graduates and nearly 5,000 other guests gathered inside a white tent
on this sylvan campus.
   Even as the first ladies arrived, some of the seniors who
protested the choice of President Bush's homemaker wife as their
commencement speaker fired off a new letter urging Mrs. Bush to
``take a definitive and vocal stand'' on abortion rights and other
issues.
   Copies were placed on each of the chairs inside the tent.
   Mrs. Bush sounded the same themes she usually discusses at
commencements, but acknowledged with a joke the controversy over her
appearance.
   ``I know your first choice for today was Alice Walker, known for
`The Color Purple,''' she said. ``Instead you got me, known for the
color of my hair,'' said the woman George Bush affectionately calls
the Silver Fox.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, dressed in a gray suit rather than the
traditional gown worn by commencement speakers, told the graduates
that women ``have our special mission.''
   ``Always, even in the most cruel and troubled times, women have
had the mission of peacemaking, humanism, mercy and kindness,'' she
said. ``And if people in the world today are more confident of a
peaceful future we have to give a great deal of credit for that to
women.''
   The lone note of discord came during the playing of the Soviet
national anthem when a handful of protesters held up a banner that
read, ``Free the Baltics.''
   Mrs. Bush urged the women to ``cherish your human connections,
your relationships with friends and family.''
   ``You will never regret not having passed one more test, not
winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will
regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child or a
parent,'' she said.
   Closing with a device she has used before, Mrs. Bush said,
``Somewhere out in this audence may even be someone who will one day
follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the
president's spouse. I wish him well!''
   ``The controversy ends here, but our conversation is only
beginning,'' she said.
   Prior to the speech, Peggy B. Reid and Susana R. Cardenas had
their new broadside waiting on each of the chairs. Cardenas was one
of the main organizer's of the petition drive in April protesting
the choice of Mrs. Bush as commencement speaker.
   ``We ask you, Barbara Bush, as a concerned mother and as a symbol
of service to others, to take a definitive and vocal stand on the
following critical issues that shape the lives of women in the
United States,'' they said.
   The issues include the ``deterioration of women's reproductive
rights''; passage of a family and medical leave act that President
Bush has threatened to veto, and affordable day care.
   Some 150 students signed a petition in April questioning whether
the president's homemaker wife was a suitable model of female
accomplishment.
   Mrs. Bush, a college dropout, tendered her invitation to Raisa
Gorbachev _ a philosophy Ph.D. and former university lecturer _
before the Wellesley students mounted their protest.
   Mrs. Bush, who turns 65 on June 12, dropped out of Smith College
in 1944 in her sophomore year to marry her teenage sweetheart,
George Bush, then a torpedo-bomber pilot for the Navy.
   Before returning to Washington in mid-afternoon, the first ladies
were expected to take a driving tour of downtown Boston with a stop
at the Boston Public Gardens and a meeting with about 30 students
from the Mathers School, the oldest public school.

   A businessman accused of bilking
celebrities and other investors out of millions of dollars was found
dead on a golf course from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot
wound to the head, authorities said.
   The body of Richard M. Wood, 56, was found Wednesday afternoon,
sitting in a golf cart near the fifth tee and holding a handgun,
said Cindee Singletary, spokeswoman for the Charlotte County
Sheriff's Department. Investigators tentatively concluded it was a
suicide, she said Thursday.
   In recent months, the Tampa corporate and tax lawyer had been the
target of lawsuits and claims totaling $17.5 million in Florida,
North Carolina and Michigan.
   Sportscasters Merlin Olsen and Dick Enberg and 11 other investors
sued Wood in January, claiming he siphoned $9 million in profits
they should have received from an Ann Arbor, Mich., commercial real
estate venture.
   Other investors, including a Florida lottery winner, claimed in
lawsuits that Wood owed them money given to him for investment
purposes.
   Wood's Tampa-based Richard Wood &amp; Co. closed its offices last
fall. An office in Ann Arbor closed in February.
   In 1987, Wood estimated his net worth at up to $46 million. But
NCNB National Bank of Florida later foreclosed on his Tampa home,
saying he defaulted on loans worth $1.6 million.

   Following are excerpts from Barbara
Bush's speech Friday at Wellesley College:
   I'm really thrilled to be here today, and very excited, as I know
all of you must be, that Mrs. Gorbachev could join us. These are
exciting times. They're exciting in Washington. And I had really
looked forward to coming to Wellesley. I thought it was going to be
fun. I never dreamt it would be this much fun.
   More than 10 years ago, when I was invited here to talk about our
experiences in the People's Republic of China, I was struck by both
the natural beauty of your campus and the spirit of this place.
Wellesley ... is not just a place, but an idea _ an experiment in
excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated, but is embraced.
   The essence of this spirit was captured in a moving speech about
tolerance given last year by a student body president of one of your
sister colleges.
   As that very wise young woman said, ``Diversity, like anything
worth having, requires effort.'' Effort to learn about and respect
difference, to be compassionate with one another, to cherish our own
identity, and to accept unconditionally the same in others. You
should all be very proud that this is the Wellesley spirit.
   Now I know your first choice today was Alice Walker ... Known for
``The Color Purple.'' Instead, you got me, known for the color of my
hair!
   Alice Walker's book has a special resonance here. For four years,
the class of '90 has worn the color purple.
   Today, you meet ... to say goodbye to all of that, to begin a new
and a very personal journey, to search for your own true colors. In
the world that awaits you beyond the shores of Lake Waban, no one
can say what your true colors will be. But this I do know: You have
a first-class education from a first-class school, and so you need
not, probably cannot live a paint-by-numbers life.
   Decisions are not irrevocable, choices do come back, and as you
set off from Wellesley, I hope many of you will consider making
three very special choices. The first is to believe in something
larger than yourself, to get involved in some of the big ideas of
our time.
   I chose literacy because I honestly believed that if morepeople
could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to
solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our
society.
   And early on, I made another choice, which I hope you will make
as well. Whether you are talking about education, career, or
service, you are talking about life and life really must have joy.
   It's supposed to be fun. One of the reasons I made the most
important decision of my life, to marry George Bush, is because he
made me laugh. It's true, sometimes we laugh through our tears, but
that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds. Find the
joy in life because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off _ ``Life
moves pretty fast and if you don't stop and look around once in a
while you are going to miss it.''
   The third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your human
connections, your relationships with family and friends. For several
years you've had impressed upon you the importance to your career of
dedication and hard work, and of course that's true. But as
important as your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, a business
leader will be, you are a human being first and those human
connections with spouses, with children, with friends are the most
important investment you will ever make.
   At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed
one more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more
deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a
friend, or a parent.
   We are in a transitional period right now _ fascinating and
exhilarating times, learning to adjust to changes and the choices we
_ men and women _ are facing.
   Now, maybe we should adjust faster and maybe we should adjust
slower. But whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will
never change: Fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must
come first. You must read to your children and you must hug your
children and you must love your children. Your success as a family,
our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the White
House but on what happens inside your house.
   For over 50 years, it was said that the winner of Wellesley's
annual hoop race would be the first to get married. Now they say the
winner will be the first to become a CEO.... I want to offer a new
legend. The winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her
dream _ not society's dreams _ her own personal dream.
   Who knows? Somewhere out there in this audience may even be
someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the
White House as the president's spouse, and I wish him well.
   Well, the controversy ends here, but our conversation is only
beginning, and a worthwhile conversation it has been. So, as you
leave Wellesley today, take with you deep thanks for the courtesy
and the honor you have shared with Mrs. Gorbachev and with me.
   Thank you. God bless you. And may your future be worthy of your
dreams.

   Here are excerpts from the speech of
Raisa Gorbachev at the commencement Friday of Wellesley College:
   I'm pleased to be with you on this momentous and exciting day
when you are leaving your college and entering a new life. I
congratulate you on this important occasion. I'm grateful to Mrs.
Barbara Bush and to the college administration for this chance of
coming to Wellesley during our stay in America.
   I thank college officials, professors and all of you for your
kind words and warm feelings.
   I distinctly remember a similar summer day in Moscow, the years
of my studies at Moscow University, where we were then full of plans
and hopes just like you are today.
   Being young is a marvelous time, a time of actions and
expectations, of being confident of one's abilities, and sure that
everything is still ahead. I wish that all your dreams of the future
come true. The president of the Soviet Union asked me to convey to
you his warm regards. He also wishes you happy roads in your life.
   We know that people in America show great interest in what is
happening in the Soviet Union, the land of perestroika. This word
nowadays sounds the same in all languages of the world.
   We associate with perestroika the future of our country whose
millions of people speak over 120 languages.
   Perestroika was conceived and is being implemented for the sake
of the people, their dignity and equality. Its goal is to make
humane ideals and values a reality.
   This vast and difficult task is a tough challenge. But we are
confident that perestroika will succeed. The guarantee of that is
the patriotism and talent of our people, their tanacity, their
strength and their desire to overcome obstacles on the way, on the
road they chose. In renewing our country we want to make it open to
the world. The Soviet people know the value of this. We wish to have
good relations with the Americans and other peoples.
   First, all of us, builders and sons of our own countries and
peoples are different. The Soviet Union and the United States have
different histories, traditions and cultures.
   That, however, is not the reason for mutual estrangement and
suspicion. People on both sides ... realize more and more clearly
there are values that bring us closer. Such values are love for
one's own native country, love for one's relatives, children. We
believe in what is good and the ability to combat, wars, violence,
hunger and catastrophes and other threats to mankind. These values
are now more important than anything else.
   Hamlet's question, ``To be or not to be'' today confronts not
only as individuals or nations, but the entire humanity. So, what
will our society be like? Not only the leaders of states, but the
world community as a whole share this responsibility.
   We women have our special mission. Always, even in the most cruel
and troubled times, women have had the mission of peacemaking,
humanism, mercy and kindness. And if people in the world today are
more confident of a peaceful future, we have to give a great deal of
credit for that to women who are active in advocating friendship,
cooperation and mutual understanding among nations.
   You are entering a complex and multi-faceted world. Your
generation will soon assume the responsibility for everything that
takes place on our planet. May good luck and happiness be with you.
   I wish you many good accomplishments. Thank you.

<HEAD>N.H., Maine Heading For Supreme Court Battle Over Shipyard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON LESKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Hampshire and Maine are on a crash
course for a U.S. Supreme Court battle over what King George II
really meant when he drew their mutual boundary. The outcome could
affect thousands of jobs.
   Rep. Bob Smith, R-N.H., scheduled a news conference Monday to
discuss a three-year research project involving the Library of
Congress that was triggered by an irate worker at the Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard.
   Smith is expected to announce that King George's 1737 ruling has
been misinterpreted and that the shipyard, on an island in the
Piscataqua River and listed in Kittery, Maine, is and always has
been New Hampshire property.
   Maine officials disagree.
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that the shipyard hasn't been
moved since Maine became a state in 1820,'' Maine Attorney General
James Tierney said Thursday. He criticized Smith, who is running for
U.S. Senate, for leading the investigation.
   The border skirmish provokes strong emotions because it affects
people in their wallets.
   Maine collects about $3 million in income taxes annually from
about 4,300 New Hampshire residents working at the shipyard. If the
shipyard were in New Hampshire, they'd pay no income tax; the state
is one of two that have no general sales tax or general income tax.
   Victor Bourre, a shipyard worker and New Hampshire resident,
started exploring the question in 1987 because he was tired of
paying Maine income tax.
   ``Everybody has always said the shipyard is in New Hampshire, so
I set out to prove it,'' said Bourre, 42. ``The more I dug into it,
the more I realized it's in New Hampshire and I had the proof. It's
clear cut.''
   According to Bourre, the territory now known as Maine originally
included all land beyond _ north and east of _ the Piscataqua River.
   The king's 1737 ruling settled a border dispute between New
Hampshire and Massachusetts, then both British colonies. That ruling
moved the boundary between New Hampshire and Maine, then part of
Massachusetts, to the middle of the river, he said.
   The recognized line today is in the channel between the shipyard
and Portsmouth, N.H. But Bourre said documents, some from the 1600s,
show that in 1737 the river was considered to flow between Kittery
and five islands that were filled in to become Seavey Island, on
which the shipyard was built in 1800.
   The king's middle of the river thus was between Kittery and the
shipyard, putting the shipyard in New Hampshire, he said.
   ``That's the true boundary between Maine and New Hampshire,''
Bourre said. ``I've got the documents, and that's what they
considered the river back then.''
   Bourre sent his information to Smith, who relayed it to the
Library of Congress. Bourre said a Library of Congress investigation
upheld his assertion, and Smith sent the ensuing report to Gov. Judd
Gregg.
   Gregg asked his attorney general's office to investigate earlier
this year. Though no lawsuit has been filed, New Hampshire appears
headed in that direction to claim the shipyard.
   ``I'm sure there will be amicable discussions with Maine, which
will prove fruitless, after which I expect we'll move to file before
the Supreme Court,'' New Hampshire Attorney General John Arnold told
The Wall Street Journal recently. Arnold did not return telephone
calls from The Associated Press, and Assistant Attorney General Dana
Bisbee refused to comment.
   It's not the first trip to the Supreme Court for the two states.
Maine and New Hampshire also went to the nation's high court in
1976, when the court ruled in Maine's favor in an offshore boundary
dispute between lobster fishermen.
   Bourre said the shipyard dispute is complex and the relevant
information is not easily obtained.
   ``No one knew any different. It's too complicated,'' he said.
``When you hear all the facts, you'll know why they never figured it
out.''
   In fact, there's even been a New Hampshire ruling in favor of
Maine. In 1969, New Hampshire's then-Attorney General George
Pappagianis ruled that Maine was the shipyard's rightful owner. He
also based his decision on King George II's 253-year-old ruling.

   For some performers at the Spoleto
Festival U.S.A. success depends, literally, on a wing and a prayer.
   For the first time in the 14-year history of the arts festival an
opera by Richard Wagner opera is being presented. ``Parsifal'' will
be the festival's largest operatic production ever. A total of 269
people are involved, including performers, orchestra, choir and
production staff.
   And three pigeons.
   The opera, directed by festival founder and artistic director
Gian Carlo Menotti, tells the story of Parsifal and his quest for
the Holy Grail.
   ``Parsifal'' is the last opera written by Wagner and was directed
by Menotti in 1987 during Spoleto's companion festival, the Festival
of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
   The role of Parsifal is being reprised by William Pell, who
performed it at the Italian festival. Ruthild Engert-Ely, who also
appeared in Italy, will again perform the role of Kundry. Both are
members of the Deutsche Berlin Opera.
   In one scene, a pigeon flies to Parsifal as a sign from God. The
opera calls for a dove to land on Parsifal's shoulder but that won't
exactly happen at Spoleto.
   Instead, fancy pigeons are being used. They're white like doves
but larger so they show up better on the stage. Also, since trainer
Sherri Kaiserman and the three pigeons only arrived Thursday and the
opera's first show is Saturday, there won't be time to train them to
fly to the actor's shoulder.
   ``We're just getting it to fly to him and if it gets near him,
it's a big plus,'' said Ms. Kaiserman, a trainer with the Dawn
Animal Agency in New York City who has worked with animals for a
decade.
   ``It's less common for a pigeon to land on somebody's shoulder,''
she said. ``They are more secure on a fixed object.''
   The pigeons have been living in Gaillard Municipal Auditorium,
where the opera will be performed, since they arrived so they can
become familiar with the surroundings, Ms. Kaiserman said.
   ``What you have to do is spend a lot of time with them and
reinforcing things,'' she said.
   Some birds work to noise cues and some to visual cues and the
trainer must decide which bird works best in which situation, she
said.
   ``The less intelligent the animal is, the harder it is to work
with,'' said Kaiserman, who has also worked with dolphins. ``You
have only their instincts to work with. It's not as simple as a dog
when you give it some food and tell it to come.
   ``What works for one bird may not work for another,'' she added.
   The production also will be staged Monday. The auditorium, newly
reopened, was badly damaged during Hurricane Hugo on Sept. 21
hurricane, leaving 29 dead and $5.9 billion damage in South Carolina.

   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson says a prospective
campaign by his wife to succeed him is not an effort to get around
the state constitution limiting him to a single, four-year term.
   ``She makes up her own mind about what she wants to do and she
goes and does it,'' he said in an interview.
   Martha Wilkinson registered a committee Wednesday to raise money
for a campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1991. Her husband
said his political action committee would contribute to the effort.
   Mrs. Wilkinson has maintained a high profile during her husband's
2{ years in office, championing adult education and the General
Educational Development program. Her image appears on posters and
billboards across the state promoting ``Martha's GED Army.''
   She said she planned to organize and raise money for six months
before making a formal announcement. ``Along about Christmastime
we'll see what unfolds,'' she said.
   ``I think you have to consider her a very formidable potential
candidate,'' said Lexington Mayor Scotty Baesler, an announced
Democratic candidate.
   Also running in the primary are Lt. Gov. Brereton Jones and
Gatewood Galbraith, a Lexington lawyer who advocates legalization of
marijuana. Dr. Floyd G. Poore, a key Wilkinson supporter in 1987, is
an all-but-announced candidate.
   Mrs. Wilkinson, who has scheduled her first fund-raiser for June
13, said she wanted to carry on her husband's programs and policies.
But her husband dismissed any comparison to the surrogate election
in 1966 of the late Lurleen Wallace to succeed her husband, former
Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace.
   Wilkinson has refused to say whether he is considering running
for lieutenant governor in 1991.

<HEAD>Justice Won't Appeal Computer Virus Sentence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Friday it won't
appeal the sentence of a suspended Cornell University graduate
student placed on probation for paralyzing a nationwide computer
network.
   The Justice Department, which had sought a prison term for Robert
T. Morris Jr., decided last month not to appeal the lighter sentence
imposed May 4 by a federal judge in Syracuse, N.Y.
   The decision was made after a recommendation by Assistant
Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the criminal
division, officials said.
   Morris, 23, convicted of unleashing a computer virus in 1988 that
immobilized 6,000 computers linked to a government network, was
placed on three years' probation, fined $10,000 and ordered to
perform 400 hours of community service.
   The son of a government computer scientist, Morris was the first
person convicted under the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He was
found guilty in January of breaking and entering the Internet
Computer Network by designing and unleashing a computer virus.
   Under procedures that took effect in 1987, both the prosecution
and defense may appeal the judge's sentence. Justice officials felt
prosecutors made their point by obtaining the felony conviction,
said spokesman Doug Tillett.
   ``In terms of deterrent value, our point was made by the fact we
brought the case,'' Tillett said. ``It was up to the discretion of
the judge to mete out a proper sentence.''
   Justice officials regarded Morris as ``a bright kid who shouldn't
have done what he did,'' Tillett said. The case was seen as an
important test of the computer fraud law.
   The defense argued that the government was over-reacting in
trying to brand Morris a criminal.
   Morris' lawyers said their client didn't benefit from the
computer virus, noting that others convicted of such crimes had
stolen money.
   Morris testified that the computer virus, which he admitted
designing to invade Internet, was an experiment that got out of
control.
   Prosecutors contended that Morris carefully plotted an assault on
the nationwide network of government, military and university
computers that was disabled in November 1988 by the virus that
originated from Morris' computer at Cornell.
   Defense lawyer Thomas Guidoboni said he was pleased about the
government's decision not to appeal.
   Morris, suspended from Cornell's graduate program in computer
science, must apply for readmission if he wants to return, Guidoboni
said.

<HEAD>Iran Ready to Talk to Britain About Rushdie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite broken diplomatic ties, the
government would agree to talks with Britain if they focus on the
Salman Rushdie novel that has raised an uproar in the Moslem world,
an Iranian official said Thursday.
   Hussein Musavian, director-general of the Foreign Ministry, also
said Iran would continue its efforts for release of all hostages in
Lebanon.
   His stand was at odds with statements in recent weeks by Iranian
hard-liners, including former Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi. They have said Iran should not help win release of
foreign hostages in Lebanon until Washington makes a gesture of good
will.
   Such a gesture would be to thank Iran for its help in winning the
release of two American hostages in April.
   In his comments Thursday, Musavian said the Indian-born Rushdie's
book, ``The Satanic Verses'' was ``the greatest obstacle in
Tehran-London relations.''
   Britain and Iran severed ties in February 1989 after the late
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on Moslems
worldwide to kill Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming Islam in the
novel.
   ``If direct talks were proposed to discuss Rushdie's blasphemous
book and to exchange views about the difficulties in the way of
resuming relations, we would not reject such a proposal,'' he said.
   He said Britain would ``have to make it clear that it respects
Islam and Moslems and condemns insults to Islam, such as those
contained in Rushdie's book.''
   Musavian said if Britain revised its blasphemy law, it would be
``a great step'' toward resumption of ties.
   British Moslems angered by Rushdie's book have demanded that the
law, which only applies to insults to Christianity, be changed to
include Islam.
   Hussein Musawi, leader of the Shiite Moslem fundamentalist Islam
Amal in Lebanon, called last month for Rushdie's deportation from
Britain. He said if Britain expelled the author, it would help gain
release of British hostages in Lebonon.
   British officials said they would not deport Rushdie.
   Musavian said he refused direct talks in Dublin, Ireland, with a
British official last month because ``it was not clear what was on
the agenda.'' A British Foreign Office spokesman had said it was
London's understanding that the Iranians wanted a meeting.
   Asked whether Iran would boost its current efforts to gain
release of four Britons missing in Lebanon if diplomatic ties were
restored, Musavian replied ``I cannot deny this.''
   The 16 Western hostages in Lebanon, including six Americans, are
believed held by pro-Iranian Moslem factions. The longest-held is
Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Musavian also said ``Iran's efforts will continue for release of
all the hostages without any preconditions and for humanitarian
reasons.''
   He said these efforts are unrelated to ``nationality, bilateral
relations, negotiations or deals.''
   But he condemned the United States, saying it had refused to make
a goodwill gesture to Iran and the kidnappers since the two American
educators were released.
   He said Washington should help release hundreds of Lebanese and
Palestinian Moslems imprisoned in Israel and in south Lebanon.
   ``If the United States and the West show good will and gain the
release of most of the Palestinian and Lebanese Moslems, I have no
doubt this will result in the release of all the hostages,'' he said.
   President Bush has said he will make ``no deals'' to free the
U.S. hostages.

   How do you thank a man who worked 60 years in
the fire department? Give him his own fire box, of course.
   The village no longer uses the old cast-iron fire boxes and is
selling 50 of them for $45 each. One box was also given to Dick
Tenney, who spent 60 years with the Walden Fire Department.
   Tenney said he didn't want one, but others feel differently,
buying all but about a dozen so far.
   ``I don't know what the heck they want them for,'' Tenney said.
``Maybe they'd make good anchors.''
   Tenney said the alarm box system served Walden well for more than
100 years. Residents would pull the alarm and then direct the fire
company to the exact location of the blaze when firefighters arrived.
   But the alarm box system has deteriorated in recent years to the
point where it was uneconomical to keep them in service, said
village manager Patricia Dwyer.
   The fire department now depends on phone calls and automatic
alarms.

   Following is the text of Barbara Bush's
speech Friday at the commencement of Wellesley College:
   President Keohane, Mrs. Gorbachev, trustees, faculty, parents,
and I should say, Julie Porter, class president, and certainly, my
new best friend, Christine Bicknell. And of course, the class of
1990.
   I'm really thrilled to be here today, and very excited, as I know
all of you must be, that Mrs. Gorbachev could join us.
   These are exciting times. They're exciting in Washington. And I
had really looked forward to coming to Wellesley. I thought it was
going to be fun. I never dreamt it would be this much fun. So, thank
you for that.
   More than 10 years ago, when I was invited here to talk about our
experiences in the People's Republic of China, I was struck by both
the natural beauty of your campus and the spirit of this place.
Wellesley, you see, is not just a place, but an idea _ an experiment
in excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated, but is
embraced. The essence of this spirit was captured in a moving speech
about tolerance given last year by a student body president of one
of your sister colleges.
   She related the story by Robert Fulghum about a young pastor
finding himself in charge of some very energetic children, hits upon
a game called ``Giants, Wizards and Dwarfs.'' ``You have to decide
now,'' the pastor instructed the children, ``which you are _ a
giant, a wizard or a dwarf?'' At that, a small girl tugging at his
pants leg, asks, ``But where do the mermaids stand?'' And the pastor
tells her there are no mermaids. And she says, ``Oh yes there are. I
am a mermaid.''
   Now, this little girl knew what she was, and she was not about to
give up on either her identity or the game. She intended to take her
place wherever mermaids fit into the scheme of things. Where do the
mermaids stand _ all of those who are different, those who do not
fit the boxes and the pigeonholes? ``Answer that question,'' wrote
Fulghum, ``and you can build a school, a nation, or a whole world.''
   As that very wise young woman said, ``Diversity, like anything
worth having, requires effort.'' Effort to learn about and respect
difference, to be compassionate with one another, to cherish our own
identity, and to accept unconditionally the same in others.
   You should all be very proud that this is the Wellesley spirit.
   Now I know your first choice today was Alice Walker _ guess how I
know? Known for ``The Color Purple.'' Instead, you got me, known for
the color of my hair!
   Alice Walker's book has a special resonance here. At Wellesley,
each class is known by a special color. For four years, the class of
'90 has worn the color purple.
   Today, you meet on Severance Green to say goodbye to all of that,
to begin a new and a very personal journey, to search for your own
true colors. In the world that awaits you beyond the shores of Lake
Waban, no one can say what your true colors will be. But this I do
know: You have a first-class education from a first-class school,
and so you need not, probably cannot live a paint-by-numbers life.
   Decisions are not irrevocable, choices do come back, and as you
set off from Wellesley, I hope many of you will consider making
three very special choices. The first is to believe in something
larger than yourself, to get involved in some of the big ideas of
our time.
   I chose literacy because I honestly believed that if more people
could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to
solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our
society.
   And early on, I made another choice, which I hope you will make
as well. Whether you are talking about education, career, or
service, you are talking about life and life really must have joy.
   It's supposed to be fun. One of the reasons I made the most
important decision of my life, to marry George Bush, is because he
made me laugh. It's true, sometimes we laugh through our tears, but
that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds. Find the
joy in life because as Ferris Bueller said on his day off _ ``Life
moves pretty fast and if you don't stop and look around once in a
while you are going to miss it.''
   I am not going to tell George you clapped more for Ferris than
you clapped for George.
   The third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your human
connections, your relationships with family and friends. For several
years you've had impressed upon you the importance to your career of
dedication and hard work, and of course that's true. But as
important as your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, a business
leader will be, you are a human being first and those human
connections with spouses, with children, with friends are the most
important investment you will ever make.
   At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed
one more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more
deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a
friend or a parent.
   We are in a transitional period right now _ fascinating and
exhilarating times, learning to adjust to changes and the choices we
_ men and women _ are facing. As an example, I remember what a
friend said on hearing her husband complain to his buddies that he
had to babysit. Quickly setting him straight, my friend told her
husband that when it's your own kids, it's not called babysitting.
   Now, maybe we should adjust faster and maybe we should adjust
slower. But whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will
never change: Fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must
come first. You must read to your children and you must hug your
children and you must love your children. Your success as a family,
our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the White
House but on what happens inside your house.
   For over 50 years, it was said that the winner of Wellesley's
annual hoop race would be the first to get married. Now they say the
winner will be the first to become a CEO. Both of those stereotypes
show too little tolerance for those who want to know where the
mermaids stand.
   So, I want to offer a new legend. The winner of the hoop race
will be the first to realize her dream _ not society's dreams _ her
own personal dream.
   Who knows? Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who
will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House
as the president's spouse, and I wish him well.
   Well, the controversy ends here, but our conversation is only
beginning, and a worthwhile conversation it has been. So, as you
leave Wellesley today, take with you deep thanks for the courtesy
and the honor you have shared with Mrs. Gorbachev and with me.
   Thank you. God bless you. And may your future be worthy of your
dreams.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Taylor, the U.S.-educated rebel
leader whose army bore down on the capital this week, is a former
bureaucrat who speaks enthusiastically about capitalism _ but not
democracy.
   Taylor denies government allegations he embezzled $1 million
while he ran the General Services Administration, Liberia's
purchasing agency. He is wanted in the United States for escaping
custody pending extradition to Liberia.
   Taylor, 42, spent the 1970s working as a mechanic at a plastics
factory in Boston before graduating with an economics degree from
Bentley College in Waltham, Mass.
   During those years, Taylor says he headed an organization of
35,000 Liberian exiles in the United States. He said they were
working to overthrow the rule of his country by the descendants of
freed American slaves who founded the nation in 1847.
   Taylor returned to Liberia after Samuel Doe took power in a 1979
military coup, giving the indigenous population control of the West
African country for the first time in its history.
   Doe named Taylor head of the General Services Administration.
   Taylor fled to the United States in 1983 to escape charges of
embezzlement.
   He was arrested in the United States but escaped before he could
be extradited.
   ``I skipped from jail to escape Doe's lies,'' Taylor has said. He
said all charges would be dropped if he toppled Doe's government.
   Taylor's revolt began Dec. 24, 1989, when he crossed the Ivory
Coast border into Liberia with a small band of men. They accused Doe
of corruption, mismanagement and human rights abuses.
   Taylor based his men in Nimba County, an area traditionally
hostile to Doe.
   Doe's forces responded with savage attacks on tribal groups that
supported Taylor. International agencies say hundreds were killed,
and the atrocities appeared to have increased support for Taylor.
   Taylor has made good use of the news media, making frequent
telephone calls to the British Broadcasting Corp. and other news
organizations.
   Last month, he gave a news conference for foreign journalists in
Tapeta, in the heart of rebel-held territory about 100 miles
northeast of Monrovia, the capital.
   The bearded rebel said he wanted to assure the United States,
Liberia's main foreign aid donor, that he was committed to good
relations.
   ``The United States has permanent interests in Liberia, and not
permanent friends,'' he said. ``I would hope that we would have a
real good marriage and a real honeymoon.''
   But his declarations on democracy have provided little cheer to
the opposition parties that had been contesting Doe's power. Taylor
said he wouldn't share power with opposition parties.
   ``Don't think we are going to turn the government over to someone
to screw up,'' he said.
   He said his plans do not include elections for at least three
years and perhaps five years.
   As a civilian, however, Taylor insists he is different from Doe,
who made his career in the military. He said he was leading ``a
grass-roots civilian uprising to get rid of a dictator'' but
harbored no dictatorial ambitions himself.
   ``It is so easy to make a dictator in Liberia, and I am not going
to permit myself to be one,'' he has promised.
   
   Taylor describes himself as a ``church-going Christian'' and
pledges to restore traditional Christian values.
   ``Before, Liberians were interested in school, in church,'' he
said. ``Nobody thinks of going to church anymore. Everybody talks of
ritualistic killings.''
   The vast majority of the country's 2.5 million people practice
traditional African beliefs. Black magic, or juju, is widely
practiced.
   Taylor wears two woven amulets around his neck. His guerrillas
say the amulets are magic charms that protect the wearer from
bullets.

<TEXT>
   Oliver North testified Friday before a newly
empaneled federal grand jury that is continuing the investigation of
the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The former White House aide was accompanied into the grand jury
room by a prosecutor from the office of independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh.
   North repeatedly left the secret proceedings during an entire day
of testimony to confer with his attorneys in a courthouse hallway.
   Periodic exits from grand jury proceedings enable witnesses to
receive legal advice and to keep their lawyers informed about what
areas of questioning the government is interested.
   During one break, North lawyer Brendan Sullivan began shouting at
Iran-Contra prosecutor Craig Gillen.
   ``You don't intimidate me and I don't intimidate you,'' replied
Gillen, who then returned to the grand jury room. North followed a
few minutes later.
   Walsh's office is trying to determine the precise roles that
then-President Reagan, then-Vice President Bush and others played in
the affair, sources familiar with the investigation said in April.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said North and
former national security adviser John Poindexter were likely to be
subpoenaed and granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for
their grand jury testimony.
   North appearedn federal court a week ago in a closed session for
which all records are under seal.
   The grand jury delving into the scandal began meeting last month,
after Poindexter's April felony convictions.
   Walsh's office has repeatedly refused to make any comment on the
latest phase of its 3{-year-old investigation.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors have had more than a year to pore over
about 2,800 pages of notebooks that North kept while he worked at
the National Security Council.
   The daily notebook entries refer to occasional meetings with Bush
and Reagan. They also refer to dozens of contacts with CIA officers
such as Alan Fiers and State Department officials such as Elliott
Abrams who kept track of the Nicaraguan Contras.
   North, 46, was convicted May 4, 1989, of aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress, altering and destroying National Security
Council documents and receiving an illegal gratuity.
   An appeal of his convictions is pending before the U.S. Court of
Appeals.
   Poindexter, convicted in April of conspiracy, obstructing
Congress and making false statements in the scandal, is scheduled to
be sentenced June 11. The former national security adviser faces up
to 25 years in prison and $1.25 million in fines.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hopped
out of his limousine Friday and worked the crowds for a second
straight day to the delight of passersby in downtown Washington.
   ``He was a very warm, very personal type of person,'' said Keith
White, who was among those Gorbachev greeted on busy Connecticut
Avenue.
   Gorbachev's brief stop came as his entourage was returning to the
Soviet Embassy from a summit session at the White House. He also
left his limousine on Thursday, to the applause and cheers of a
crowd of about 500 onlookers.
   On Friday, Gorbachev greeted pedestrians about a half-block from
the spot where he had surprised security agents in 1987 by doing the
same thing.
   Some people who remembered the 1987 incident had gathered there
in hopes Gorbachev would repeat the performance.
   The Soviet president shook hands with several people, at one
point crossing the wide avenue to greet more people.
   ``As opposed to him being afraid, he initiated all of the
conversations and the handshakes,'' White said.

<HEAD>Romania, Bulgaria Begin Assessing Damage of Quake</HEAD>

   Romania and Bulgaria on Friday began
assessing the damage of an earthquake and more than 120 aftershocks
that jolted central Europe.
   Fourteen people were reported killed and 1,000 injured as the
quake rumbled through five countries Wednesday. Nine people were
killed in Romania, one in Bulgaria and four in the Soviet Union. The
quake also struck Turkey and Yugoslavia, but no deaths were reported
in those countries.
   The strongest aftershock rocked the greater part of Romania and
northern Bulgaria at 3:18 a.m. Thursday. Thousands of people jumped
from their beds and fled into the streets, where many spent the rest
of the night.
   The aftershocks continued Friday.
   The Romanian government, trying to cope with its third major
earthquake in 13 years, said in a communique Friday it would give
top priority to repairs to buildings.
   The Ministry of National Economy said it had no estimate of
damage.
   The northern Bulgarian city of Silistra on Thursday appealed for
aid, saying it urgently needed glass, cement, bricks and tiles to
repair damaged homes, schools and a hospital, the Bulgarian news
agency BTA reported.
   Citing ``preliminary data,'' BTA said the quake destroyed 39
residential buildings, made 153 unfit to live in and damaged 6,018
more across the nation.
   Nineteen school buildings, 11 kindergartens, three hospitals and
63 public and farm buildings also were damaged, BTA said.
   Dumitru Enescu, director of Romania's Earth Physics Institute,
said the quake and main aftershock were centered in the Vrancea
Mountains, part of the Carpathian range about 200 miles northeast of
Bucharest.
   ``We estimate that this seismological activity in Vrancea and the
aftershocks are going down and losing intensity,'' he said.
   Richter scale readings of Wednesday's quake from seismological
stations around the world ranged from 6.5 to 7.5, putting it in the
range of major to extremely powerful.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   Enescu said he believed the quake had a magnitude of between 6.5
and 6.8.
   The Uppsala Seismological Center in Sweden said the quake was
very deep, about 63 miles, causing it to be felt so widely.
   Focsani, capital of Vrancea County where the quake was centered,
escaped without a shattered window. But up to 20 Romanians were
slightly injured in Thursday's powerful aftershock, and two others
were hurt more seriously, medical assistant Grigore Nica said.
   A prefabricated block of 64 apartments and the local bank
suffered severe structural damage Thursday. City Hall suffered major
cracks in the ceiling and walls.
   Locksmith Vasile Ignat aid there was panic in Focsani when the
aftershock struck.
   ``The power was cut off in certain areas. People hit the street.
They panicked that another quake would come,'' he said. ``In the
evening, they no longer dared to go into their homes.''
   In Bucharest, a few camped out again in tents on Thursday night
but the panic subsided by Friday.
   Some buildings in the capital suffered serious structural damage,
but otherwise the city escaped serious damage.
   In northern Bulgaria, cities and villages on the Danube river _
including Ruse, Silistra and Svishtov _ ``were panic-stricken''
after Thursday's strong aftershock, BTA reported. It said thousands
of people milled in the streets all night or fled in their cars.

   The U.S. Marine Corps' first woman general
is retiring and the service said farewell with a battalion-strength
parade.
   Hundreds of civilian and military observers were on hand for
Thursday's ceremony at the Quantico Marine Corps Base marking the
retirement of Brig. Gen. Gail M. Reals.
   ``You saw many firsts. But most importantly, you were first a
Marine,'' Marine Commandant Gen. Al Gray wrote to Reals, commander
of the base.
   Reals, 54, had more than 35 years of military service. ``I've
been thinking, I'll be unemployed for the first time since I was 13
years old,'' she said. ``I leave 20 pounds lighter than I was at 19,
when I joined the Marine Corps.''
   Reals began her military career in 1954; her first assignment was
as a stenographer.
   She became a commissioned officer in September 1961 and rose to
her current rank in February 1985.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a
move to break a summit stalemate, has proposed the creation of a new
``Council of all Europe'' to play a decisive role in shaping the
military future of Germany, U.S. sources said Friday.
   The United States and the Soviet Union would participate in the
deliberations along with other members of the NATO and Warsaw Pact
alliances as well as neutral countries.
   Gorbachev raised the idea with President Bush at their opening
summit session Thursday, the sources said, and the two leaders
assigned their top diplomatic aides to pursue the concept next week
in Copenhagen, Denmark, and again in Berlin later this month.
   ``We are prepared to work with it. It is not something we would
reject out of hand,'' said a U.S. official familiar with the
details. He spoke only on condition he not be identified.
   At the start of his second day of summit talks with Bush,
Gorbachev was asked if Soviet concern about a revival of German
militarism would be allayed by assigning the issue to the European
Security Conference, under which the new council would function.
   ``The president and I are discussing precisely these matters, and
I must say that this is a very substantive discussion, a discussion
in which we are engaged in a spirit of great responsibility and
cooperation,'' Gorbachev replied.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said without elaboration
that ``some different formulations of the problem'' were discussed
at the summit.
   He said the Bush administration was interested in strengthening
both NATO and the European Security Conference and also ``taking a
look at their functions.''
   However, Fitzwater said, ``that was not focused on in any detail
at yesterday's meeting.''
   The Soviet spokesman, Arkady A. Maslennikov said Moscow wants to
create ``a kind of permanent structure which will create stability
and cooperation in Europe,'' perhaps by combining existing
organizations or possibly setting
   The Soviet plan calls for annual meetings of the leaders of the
35 Western, neutral and Eastern states that make up the conference,
There would be more frequent meetings of their foreign ministers, a
permanent secretariat or administrative staff, and military and
civilian ``conflict management'' centers would be set up.
   Bush and Gorbachev have concluded they cannot solve the German
question before the windup of their summit on Sunday. Consequently,
they assigned high-ranking aides to explore avenues of settlement.
   Gorbachev's proposal stems from his concerns over the unraveling
of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and a desire to be included more
directly in European consultations, especially on Germany.
   ``They are afraid that the process of German unification is
increasing their isolation,'' a U.S. official said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze earlier had
suggested placing a united Germany in both NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
but the U.S. reaction was cool.
   Now Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Shevardnadze will
explore the proposal for a new European council and possibly other
approaches when they attend a human rights conference in Copenhagen
next Tuesday and then a meeting on Germany in Berlin tentatively set
for June 22.
   ``They (the Soviets) want one game in which they are an equal
player,'' the U.S. official said. ``It is not something we are
opposed to in principle. It is an extension of ideas we are prepared
to work with.''
   The European security conference consists of 34 nations and the
Vatican which signed the 1975 Helsinki agreement to ease East-West
tensions in Europe and promote human rights.
   An administration official said Bush was telephoning West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to assure him that the summit had not altered
the U.S. position on the future of a united Germany.
   The White House announced that Bush had invited Kohl to a White
House dinner next Friday. A spokesman said the dinner was arranged
before the summit and was not based on developments over the German
issue.
   Bush and Kohl insist on full membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for the new Germany to be formed by the
unification of East and West Germany.
   In Bonn, meanwhile, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, who has been the point man for the Western allies in
seeking accommodation with Moscow, urged the superpowers to lay the
foundation for a ``new Europe.''
   Genscher, who will meet with Baker in Copenhagen next Tuesday,
said Germany should reduce its military forces to help ease Soviet
jitters over a united Germany.

   A murderer whose execution was delayed
even though he wants to die could be put to death Saturday night.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a stay Thursday
night for Thomas Baal, hours before he was to be executed.
   The stay expires at noon Saturday and Baal's death warrant is
good through the weekend, said Warden Pete Demosthenes. The
execution, by lethal injection, was reset for Saturday night.
   Baal, 26, was sentenced to die for killing a bus driver during a
1988 robbery in Las Vegas. He was housed in a last-night cell next
to the death chamber at the Nevada State Prison and spent his time
Friday talking on the telephone, the warden said.
   Demosthenes said Baal had calmed down following an outburst when
he was advised of the temporary stay issued by the 9th Circuit.
   The stay came on a request from Baal's parents, who contend that
long-term mental problems and possible brain damage prevent their
son from making a rational decision about his appeals.
   When Baal heard about the stay, he threatened to escape and
commit more crimes if he was sent to a mental institution, according
to State Prison Director Ron Angelone.
   Angelone said Baal was irate at his attorney, public defender Pat
Flanagan, who won the delay.
   ``He got real upset and he called his public defender and told
him he didn't want anyone to get involved, that he had no right to
get involved in it,'' Angelone said.
   The appeals court, in a 2-1 decision, said the delay was needed
to get more information from U.S. District Judge Howard McKibben,
who earlier Thursday denied a stay for Baal.
   Justice Harry Pregerson, who wrote the decision, questioned
whether Baal had received a proper competency hearing to determine
if he was capable of making a rational decision to give up his
appeal. Justice Alex Koznski dissented.
   McKibben ruled Baal was competent after he told the judge, in a
hearing conducted by telephone: ``I just want to go die and be free.
That's all.''
   Baal's execution would be Nevada's fifth and the 129th nationally
since the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 cleared the way for states to
resume use of the death penalty.
   Nevada's last executions were in June 1989. In the same week,
confessed murderers Sean Flanagan and William ``Bud'' Thompson were
given lethal injections after both said they wanted no further
appeals.

   Toby really wasn't qualified to be a
certified real-estate appraiser, but the cat's owner shouldn't be
punished for getting him a license, a federal judge ruled Friday.
   U.S. District Judge Ernest C. Torres dismissed a lawsuit by the
National Association of Real Estate Appraisers claiming that Toby's
owner, Roy C. Schaeffer, made the organization look foolish by
admitting a cat as an appraiser.
   Torres said the association did not prove its contention that it
was defrauded and defamed when Toby _ listed on his appraiser
certification and in court documents as Tobias F. (for feline)
Schaeffer _ was admitted.
   There was no question that Schaeffer had submitted a false,
although incomplete, application in the cat's name, Torres said. But
it was true that the cat had been granted a professional
designation, which was all that Schaeffer claimed.
   ``There's no evidence that anyone understood or reasonably could
have understood that Mr. Schaeffer ... said that plaintiffs
knowingly admitted cats,'' Torres said. ``The plaintiff has failed
to prove that the statements in question were false, and, hence the
claim for defamation is (dismissed).''
   Although there were muffled giggles throughout two days of
testimony, both sides said the issues were significant.
   The association and its owner, Robert G. Johnson, claimed
Schaeffer made the organization the laughingstock of the industry
when he publicized his cat's membership.
   Schaeffer claimed the integrity of his industry was at stake. He
said he submitted his cat's name for membership in the National
Association of Real Estate Appraisers to prove his contention that
it did not have high professional standards.
   He successfully used the incident to press Congress to approve a
national registration and licensing system for appraisers.
   The association's attorney, Michael Dady, had asked Torres to
rule against Schaeffer on the grounds that any national organization
could be duped into admitting unqualified people.
   ``If we had to verify everything in this country, the whole
system would shut down,'' Dady argued in court Thursday.
   Torres said Friday that argument had no weight. The judge said
``seemingly elementary steps,'' such as asking Rhode Island members
of the association about Tobias F. Schaeffer or requiring a
completed appraisal from him, could have avoided the incident.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev said Friday
Israeli officials are using Jewish emigres from the Soviet Union to
stymie peace efforts in the Middle East.
   ``We are really in a difficult situation now as a result of
certain actions of the Israeli government,'' Gorbachev told
congressional leaders at a Soviet Embassy meeting Friday morning.
``The situation there is very difficult now, (and) has been
exacerbated recently.''
   He said the Soviet Union wanted to work with the United States to
find a solution for Middle East peace, and noted the Soviet step
toward easing restrictions on the Jewish emigration.
   ``People are leaving, and they settle them on (the) occupied
territories and provoke clashes,'' he said. ``They are provoking a
problem between us and the Arabs. The Arab presidents are
remonstrating with us.''
   ``This is something that I think the Israelis are doing on
purpose in order to make a solution very difficult,'' he added.
   Gorbachev also said reaching a solution to Middle East peace must
be reached internationally, following Arab proposals rejected by
Israel that talks be held under the aegis of the Soviet Union,
United States and other major powers.
   ``If we begin with internationalizing that process, we will be
able to restore diplomatic relations with Israel,'' Gorbachev said.
``We are ready to be with you, the guarantors of independence and
security of the state of Israel, of all Middle Eastern states
including Israel.''
   He urged the United States to work with Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   ``He is the person with whom you can work for a settlement,''
Gorbachev said. ``He has the kind of attitude that makes that
possible. And if you are able to work with him to apply some
influence, I think that he may evolve even further.''

   About 50 Jewish ``refuseniks'' rallied in downtown
Moscow on Friday evening, urging that their plight to emigrate not
be forgotten as Soviet and U.S. leaders met in Washington.
   The half-hour demonstration on a puddle-filled square in front of
the Lenin Library was timed to coincide with one in Washington. It
occurred with little harassment from Soviet authorities.
   Two vans filled with police were parked nearby. Several
plainclothes police who made little attempt to hide their
walkie-talkies milled in the crowd. But only one uniformed officer
walked up to the demonstrators and asked them to disperse. The
officer walked away when protesters showed that they had applied to
the authorities to hold the rally.
   They held up posters and unfurled banners that said ``Refuseniks
are the hostages of perestroika!'' and ``Shame on anti-Semitism.''
   ``Our demonstration is synchronized with a demonstration in
Washington. We insist that our human rights are violated,'' said
Mike Shapiro. He said he has been denied an emigration visa even
though he stopped his secret work for the Soviet government more
than 12 years ago.
   Stephen Cohen of Palm Beach, Fla., a member of the board of
directors of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews, said there are
400 to 500 families of Jews who have been refused permission to
emigrate because Soviet officials say they have knowledge of state
secrets.
   In November, the Supreme Soviet legislature gave preliminary
approval to a bill that allows emigration for virtually anyone who
has entry permission from another country and no outstanding alimony
obligations, criminal charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.
   It sets a limit of five years on the period a citizen can be kept
from emigrating because of access to secrets.
   But Jewish activists claim that the bill is vaguely worded and
might still be used to restrict emigration.
   The bill has not yet come up for a final vote. The United States
is withholding action on loosening trade sanctions on the Soviet
Union until the immigration law is passed.
   Leonid Stonov, one long-time refusenik who was told in recent
weeks that he will be allowed to emigrate in August, said
anti-Semitism is on the rise and that he sees a difficult future for
Jews in the Soviet Union.
   ``All the Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, Jewish life _
everything was ruined here during the Stalin era and Brezhnev era.
There is no basement, no foundation for establishing here a real
Jewish life,'' he said.
   Mark M. Kotlyar, a refusenik from Kiev, was asked how he felt
when he saw President Mikhail S. Gorbachev cheered on the streets of
Washington this week. He smiled and said it was a difficult question
to answer.
   ``On the one hand, it's important that people be friendly, that
they meet our leaders, that they give them a warm reception,''
Kotlyar said. ``But on the other hand, I think that they are too
rapturous about Gorbachev. He is not that good. He is not.''
   Pamela Braun Cohen, national president of the Union of Councils
for Soviet Jews, acknowledged that Gorbachev has brought change to
the Soviet Union.
   ``The fact that we are here holding this demonstration today and
the fact that the people who have held the demonstration were not
taken away _ you can't dismiss it,'' she said.
   But she said the American public needs to be ``more tempered'' in
its approach to Gorbachev, and that might ``better serve the human
rights movement here in this country and better serve the United
States in their relationship with the Soviets.''

   Palestinian guerrillas who launched a seaborne
attack on Israel this week planned to attack the U.S. Embassy in Tel
Aviv as well as hotels and stores, a top Israeli official said today.
   Maps carried by the guerrillas indicated killings would be
carried out in the densely populated Tel Aviv beachfront hotel
district where the embassy is located, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Locations circled on the maps indicated a large Tel Aviv
department store as another potential target, he said.
   Four guerrillas were killed and 12 captured in Wednesday's raid,
which was masterminded by Mohammed Abbas, the leader of a PLO
faction.
   ``During the debriefing (of the guerrillas) ... it was
established that one of the targets in the vicinity of the hotel
district was the U.S. Embassy,'' the source said.
   ``Wherever they can, they try to accomplish a spectacular mass
killing. The U.S. Embassy was a good target that would make
headlines,'' he said.
   The comment was the first indication the guerrillas had planned
to attack the U.S. Embassy.
   Earlier today, Israel's military intelligence chief was quoted as
saying PLO chief Yasser Arafat probably did not know beforehand
about the raid.
   The comment by Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak contradicted Foreign
Ministry officials who claimed Arafat met last week with Abbas and
almost certainly knew of the planned strike. Abbas leads the
Palestine Liberation Front, the PLO faction that claimed
responsibility for Wednesday's foiled attack.
   Israel claims Libya helped mount the strike, which was aimed at
crowded Israeli beaches, and Shahak's comments in an interview with
the Yediot Ahronot daily provided the most detailed account yet of
that alleged involvement.
   But a Libyan official today denied Libyan involvement in the
raid. Gadallah Azouz el-Talhi, Libya's foreign minister, said:
``Some news media claimed that a Libyan ship carried the speedboats
that tried to go to shore. Libya has no connection at all with the
operation,'' el-Talhi said during a visit to Egypt.
   Shahak also said Israel knew ``with complete certainty'' that the
PLO has planned attacks on Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel ``in
every possible location and at every opportunity.''
   The statement was the first public comment by security officials
about threats against Soviet immigrants. Israeli newspapers have
quoted officials as saying Israel stepped up security because of
expected guerrilla attacks on Soviet Jews.
   Shahak said Arafat probably didn't know about Abbas' plans to
attack Israel. ``We don't have information pointing to the fact that
he knew ahead of time,'' Shahak said.
   Arafat said Thursday the PLO was not involved in the raid.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir called on Washington to abandon the
dialogue it began with the PLO in December 1988 after Arafat
renounced terrorism.
   Arafat avoided condemning the raid outright, and said he could
not expel Abbas from the elected PLO Executive Committee for the
attempted raid: ``He was elected in a democratic way by the
Palestine National Council, and only the council has a say on that.''
   Abbas' faction said today in a statement issued by its office in
Baghdad, Iraq, that it would continue its attacks.
   U.S. Ambassador to Israel William Brown said today that Arafat's
response was unacceptable.
   ``He has ... attempted to absolve the PLO from responsibility.
Rest assured that we're going to continue to look at that very, very
seriously,'' Brown said during a tour of the northern Israeli town
of Migdal Haemek.
   Israel radio, which carried the remarks, said Brown did not say
whether the United States would end its dialogue with the PLO.
   Shahak said the guerrillas involved in the seaborne raid trained
in a camp set aside for them by Libyan authorities on the
Mediterranean coast.
   ``The investigation shows beyond doubt that Libyan military
personnel were involved in all stages of preparation,'' Shahak said
in the newspaper interview.
   Earlier reports have said the guerrillas boarded a Libyan
merchant ship in Libya's port of Benghazi that also transported
speedboats to carry out the attack.
   ``Libyans helped to move the terrorists to the ship. The ship
itself had a Libyan crew, and aboard was a Libyan military
officer,'' Shahak said.
   The intelligence chief also said some of the guerrillas had been
in Libya for more than two years, and that training for the attack
began several months ago.
   Israeli officials have refused to comment on speculation that
Israel would retaliate against Libya.
   Former military intelligence chief Yoshua Saguy called for such a
military strike. ``Libya needs to know that, like we reached them in
the past, we will reach them again,'' Saguy told army radio.
   Saguy, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc, also suggested that Israel was reponsible for the April
16, 1988, assassination of PLO military commander Khalil Wazir in
Tunis. The slaying was widely attributed to Israeli commandos, but
Israel has denied any involvement.

   While Mikhail Gorbachev was talking to George
Bush in the White House Friday, some of the landlords _ the American
people _ inspected their property.
   They gawked at the portraits and the dinnerware, treading the
floors that Lincoln trod. Later, on the street, they said they liked
this man Gorbachev, and wished him well.
   ``I think he's wonderful, a great man; he has a wonderful
personality,'' said tour bus driver John Lauro, his bare arm still
carrying the girlie tattoo acquired as a submarine seaman during the
Vietnam War. ``The hard part will be changing the minds of the old
guard _ in both countries.''
   ``I would want him to know that he has a lot of support among the
American people,'' said Kristin Garner of Richmond, Va., whose
mother, Ann, brought her here for the day, sort of a college
graduation gift.
   What would Kristin say to Gorbachev, if she had the chance?
   ``Zdrastvyuitye, tovarish, Gorbachev!'' she beamed, proud of her
year's study of Russian at the University of North Carolina.
``Hello, comrade Gorbachev!''
   Mrs. Garner wanted to see the Impressionists at the National
Gallery of Art; Kristin insisted they first stand outside the White
House, on the chance that Gorby would come by. The gamble paid off:
The whole screaming motorcade streaked through the White House gates
while they waited.
   Comments from these random tourists _ cameras strung around their
necks, some wearing the official tourist uniform of T-shirts and
shorts _ put meat on the bones of the latest opinion samplings.
   Last week, pollsters Peter Hart and Robert Teeter reported that
59 percent of Americans view Gorbachev positively.
   None among these tourists on the White House sidewalk had
anything negative to say, although a caveat came from 52-year-old
schoolteacher Edward Schneider, who brought 38 student government
representatives from District 10, the Bronx, N.Y., to Washington.
   ``He's running into the same problems Nixon had _ loved outside
the country more than inside,'' Schneider said. ``Gorbachev's a
smart politician but I'm not sure he's calling the shots. I think
the army told him, `do something about the economy before we do.'
   ``The Afghanistan war was his Vietnam,'' Schneider said. ``He
didn't let Eastern Europe go because he loves democracy. He let them
go because he couldn't afford to keep them. I think he was shocked
by the complete rejection of communism in East Europe. That came as
a surprise.''
   Robert and Arlene Schroeder of Mequon, Wis. were delighted to
share Washington with Gorbachev, even though Mrs. Schroeder feared
the White House would be closed to tourists _ just as it had been on
two previous visits, one during World War II and one while Harry
Truman was having the place renovated.
   Schroeder, a salesman, said he figured the Cold War is pretty
much over.
   ``Sooner or later, I assumed something had to happen, good or
bad.'' he said.
   ``He's done more for the Russian people than anyone in my
lifetime,'' said Mike Erixon of Denver, Colo., who runs a company
that makes batteries for the aerospace industry.
   The end of the Cold War could be bad for the battery business,
acknowledged Erixson. ``But I'm all for world peace.''
   Louis Mattingly, 14, was one of the 43 eighth graders from
Bardstown, Ky. who rode 11 hours through the night on John Lauro's
tour bus. Louis wore a fluorescent red cap that he'd acquired at a
souvenir stand outside the Roy Rogers fast-food restaurant.
   ``I think of Gorbachev as a person who is trying to make peace
between two countries and doing a good job of it,'' he said.
   Chimed in Lauro: ``I like to talk to people on my bus. These kids
think Gorbachev is an all-right guy and is trying to bring peace to
the world.''

   Barbara Bush on Friday easily won over
most of the Class of 1990 of Wellesley College with charm and a
spirited speech that put to rest much of the controversy about her
selection as commencement speaker.
   Mrs. Bush's address, in which she urged graduates of the elite
women's school to follow their dreams and be true to themselves, was
wildly applauded.
   The 575 seniors arriving for the speech were greeted by letters
placed on their chairs urging Mrs. Bush to be a stronger proponent
of women's issues.
   Mrs. Bush, who appeared with Soviet first lady Raisa Gorbachev,
received her loudest cheers as she closed by saying:
   ``Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one
day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the
president's spouse. I wish him well!''
   One senior had painted on her mortar board ``Barbara Bush for
President 1992.'' One wore a picture of President and Mrs. Bush,
with the first lady dressed in a suit and power tie, the president
wearing a dress.
   The conflict over Mrs. Bush stemmed from a petition signed last
month by 150 of Wellesley's 2,200 students. The petition complained
that her selection as speaker ran counter to the school's philosophy
that women should be honored for their own career achievements.
   ``I thought it was lovely _ and I was one who signed the
petition,'' said Betsy Pollard, 21, a graduating senior from Pepper
Pike, Ohio. ``I was very moved by it. I thought she was great. She
knew all about us and all about our class and I appreciated it.''
   Deana Smythe, 21, a senior from Medina, N.Y., said she did not
sign the petition and was in favor of Mrs. Bush as commencement
speaker.
   ``I thought it was wonderful,'' Smythe said. ``I especially liked
the spirit of the two of them up there together.''
   The seniors who drew up the letters that were placed on the seats
said they would give a copy to Mrs. Bush. The students also made
available purple armbands _ the class color _ to be worn by students
sympathetic with the letter, which asked Mrs. Bush to support such
women's issues as day care, family leave and reproductive rights.
   But the letter also said that ``in honoring Barbara Bush as our
commencement speaker, we celebrate all the unknown women who have
dedicated their lives to the service of others. The purple armbands
you see today are in honor of these very women.''
   When college President Nan Keohane cited that section in her
remarks, loud applause erupted. Mrs. Gorbachev and Mrs. Bush smiled
broadly and clasped hands.
   The original petition, co-authored by seniors Peggy Reid, 21, and
Susana Cardenas, 21, gained national attention. Cardenas said
students never wanted publicity about the controversy and did not
want to be ``discourteous'' to Mrs. Bush.
   But the issue divided the students, as did the letter.
   Before the ceremony, Jennifer Swihart, 21, of McLean, Va., said,
``I probably won't wear the armband. I didn't sign the petition. I
think she's a cool lady, and that telling women what they can do is
a form of reverse oppression. But I think this has been good to open
up dialogue.''
   But Susan Brandzel, 21, of Seattle, said: ``We're wearing the
armbands as a tribute to the kind of work she has done. But we hope
it encourages her to speak out on issues, and we hope it encourages
her to use the power she has to work more for women's issues.''
   Many students, teachers and alumnae, alarmed by the presence of a
large media podium inside the enormous tent, complained of a circus
atmosphere. But the mood was largely a happy one at the 112th
Wellesley commencement, set up for 5,500 guests, the largest
graduation gathering ever.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's speech focused on perestroika, which, she said,
had helped pave the way for easing tensions around the world.
   ``We know that people in America showed great interest in what is
happening in the Soviet Union, the land of perestroika. This word
now sounds the same in all languages of the world,'' she said.

   Some unpleasant memories confronted
Germany as this week's summit talks turned to German unification _
among them the rise of fascism and European suffering at the hands
of Germans twice this century.
   But the Germans have played a big role in recalling the memories,
convinced that is the best way to show the Soviet Union and the rest
of the world they do not want a replay of the past.
   The main German question under discussion by Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush is the military status of a
united Germany.
   The United States and West Germany have insisted the state belong
to NATO, but Gorbachev has proposed letting the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe settle a united Germany's
military future.
   West Germany initially responded cautiously. A government
official in Bonn pointed out Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
has already called for strengthening of the council. However, no
West German leaders have suggested the council should decide what
military alliance West Germany should belong.
   Friday's Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said the summit's
success hinges on the ``German question.''
   It noted that the 1987 summit between Gorbachev and former
President Reagan was a success by virtue of an agreement to begin
scrapping intermediate-range nuclear weapons. But it said in a
commentary that the German military issue far outweighed any other
considerations at the current summit.
   ``When Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan got together, the
luster of the disarmament treaty cast a gleam on the meeting. ``But
not much of a show can be made of that (disarmament) in view of the
question of German unity and German alliance membership,'' said the
newspaper.
   The Soviets have said a big reason they oppose a united Germany
in NATO is the deep-seated memory of the Nazi Third Reich and the
carnage World War II brought to the Soviet Union.
   But West Germans have tried to use the past to reassure the
Soviets, and to state Germans' right to make their own decisions.
   Shortly before the summit, Kohl pointedly reminded Moscow that
pushing Germany ``into isolation'' has a historic precedent.
   ``There must be no second Versailles,'' Kohl said, referring to
the 1919 treaty that humiliated Germany and has been linked to the
rise of fascism.
   ``Whenever Germany chose _ out of overbearing blindness or
criminal hubris _ to pursue a separate path or when former enemies
forced it into isolation following its defeat, the immediate
consequence for Europe was conflict, instability and uncertainty,''
Kohl said.
   West German leaders believe that anchoring a united Germany to
NATO is actually the best means of protecting the Soviet Union's
security interests.
   ``A Germany that is not bound into an alliance in a clear and
effective way must also appear to the Soviet Union as a greater
danger for stable development in Europe,'' said Uwe Ronneburger,
chairman of the Defense Committee in West Germany's parliament, the
Bundestag.
   Burkhard Dobiey, a high-level official for the West German
Inter-German Relations Ministry, said he believed the Soviets are
truly worried about German military might.
   ``But the reality is, Germany is a state that has renounced every
use of violence or threat of violence,'' he said in a radio
interview Thursday night. ``It represents no threat to other
nations, also not to the Soviet Union.
   ``I think the real problem for the Soviet leadership is that for
decades NATO has been portrayed in Moscow as the arch-enemy. The
problem is, how one changes this picture.''
   Genscher has suggested broader financial ties between the Soviets
and the West, coupled with drastic disarmament and the eventual
development of new security institutions, as ways to help preserve
European stability.
   He said Friday that the alliance debate concerns creating
conditions in Europe that make NATO membership ``attractive also for
the Soviet Union.''
   ``This means, the fundamental change in Europe will transform a
confrontational relationship to one of cooperation,'' he said on
Deutschlandfunk radio.

   Five former agriculture secretaries and more
than two dozen farm-related groups called Friday for an upgrading of
trade ties with the Soviet Union so far resisted by the Bush
administration.
   ``There is a large potential for further development of this
market to the mutual benefit of the United States and the Soviet
Union,'' said the statement.
   It came as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was visiting the
United States and followed a meeting at which Gorbachev urged
cooperation from members of Congress who have resisted granting
Moscow better trade ties.
   The statement called for granting the Soviets most-favored-nation
status, which would give them the same preferential tariffs given
the United States' other top trading partners.
   The Soviet Union was the second largest single-nation importer of
U.S. farm products last year, buying a record $3.6 billion.
   President Bush said recently it was too early to grant
most-favored-nation status to the Soviets, although he recently
renewed that standing for the Chinese despite protests over last
year's bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square.
   Trade negotiations are currently under way between the United
States and the Soviets.
   ``An important part of that agreement would be
most-favored-nation status for the Soviets, giving the Soviets the
same access to our market as enjoyed by most of our trading
partners,'' the statement said.
   The signers included former agriculture secretaries John R.
Block, Orville L. Freeman, Earl L. Butz, Bob Bergland and Richard E.
Lyng.
   The statement was issued by National Agricultural Advisory
Committee of the Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs, whose
directors include former top government officials as well as
business and labor leaders.
   ``While MFN will not solve the Soviet Union's economic problems,
it would help to build a relationship that all sides can count on
for the long term and be a basis for bringing the Soviet Union more
fully into the world trading system,'' the statement said.
   It did say that to ``strengthen trade and investment ties between
our two countries, the Soviet Union must continue to expand
individual freedom, including the right of self-determination and
emigration and reach a peaceful and equitable resolution of the
Baltic situation.''
   Other signers ranged from the American Farm Bureau Federation to
the National Farmers Union to Cargill Inc., the agricultural
export-import giant. They included producer groups specializing in
meat, oats, soybeans, wheat, corn, pork and rice.

   Imelda Marcos remained hospitalized Friday for a
stomach ailment that had her coughing blood in court, and her
attorney said the former Philippines first lady was too ill to
resume her trial on schedule.
   Also Friday, the judge granted a request by CBS to quash a
subpoena to compel journalist Diane Sawyer to testify about a 1986
interview with Mrs. Marcos.
   Officials at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said Mrs.
Marcos could be out of the hospital by Sunday, but lawyer John Tigue
said there was ``no way'' she could be ready for a scheduled Tuesday
court session.
   Mrs. Marcos was visited at the hospital Friday by her lawyer,
Gerry Spence, her two sisters and her son, Ferdinand Jr., said
family spokesman Roger Peyuan. She rested well overnight and was
feeling better, Peyuan said.
   ``Mrs. Marcos' condition is much improved and she is
stabilized,'' the hospital said in a statement.
   Mrs. Marcos was admitted to the hospital Thursday after she
collapsed and coughed up blood during her federal racketeering trial.
   Doctors diagnosed her illness as erosive gastritis, an
inflammation of the stomach caused by excessive acid. They said the
ailment could have been caused by stress, but did not appear related
to a high blood pressure condition for which she has been treated
during the trial that began March 20.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is accused of having helped her husband, the
late President Ferdinand Marcos, steal $220 million from their
nation's treasury, using the money for their own purposes.
   Her co-defendant, Adnan Khashoggi, is charged with having faked
documents to show that he, not the Marcoses, owned the properties
before the Marcoses' assets were frozen by a U.S. court order.
   The government had sought to testimony from Ms. Sawyer to verify
the authenticity of an interview she conducted of Mrs. Marcos on
CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes.''
   But U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan ruled that the public's
interest in a ``vigorous, aggressive and independent'' media
outweighed the necessity of the testimony to the prosecution's case.
   The judge made his decision in a written opinion, although he
told lawyers about his intention Thursday.
   In the interview, Mrs. Marcos said her signature on a Swiss bank
record found in the presidential palace in Manila was a forgery.
   Prosecutors sought to show that Mrs. Marcos was lying because
handwriting on the document, which was presented as evidence at the
trial, had been positively identified as hers. They also said the
interview would counter defense arguments that Mrs. Marcos had no
involvement in financial dealings.

   PLO leader Yasser Arafat on Friday denounced
the United States for its veto of a U.N. resolution urging the
deployment of United Nations observers to the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   ``I only ask why the United States keeps protecting and covering
the crimes Israel is committing against the Palestinian people,''
Arafat told a news conference. ``Why does the United States champion
human rights everywhere but stop doing that when Palestinian human
rights are concerned?''
   The United States on Thursday vetoed a U.N. Security Council
resolution that called for a fact-finding mission to visit the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Of the 15 voting members, only the United
States opposed the measure. As a permanent Security Council member,
it has veto power over resolutions.
   Its veto came a day after Israel foiled an attack on its
coastline by Palestinian guerrillas. Four guerrillas were killed and
12 captured. No Israelis were harmed.
   A PLO faction, the Palestine Liberation Front, claimed
responsibility and said the action was in part to retaliate for the
murder last week of seven Palestinian laborers by an Israeli
civilian. Arafat has said neither he nor the PLO was involved in
Wednesday's incident.
   A high-ranking Israeli official said Friday in Jerusalem that the
guerrillas' intended targets included the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
information was based on maps seized from the Palestinians.
   Arafat met Friday with ambassadors of the Soviet Union, China,
Italy, France and Ireland and urged their governments to reopen U.N.
discussion of the renewed upsurge of violence in the occupied
territories.
   He also urged them to press for deployment of a U.N. observer
group to the territories, despite the U.S. veto, and to ensure
protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories.
   Arafat also said he instructed the PLO ambassador in Tunis to
meet with U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau to protest the U.S. veto.
   Palestinian leaders in Israel declared a boycott on contacts with
American diplomats to protest the U.S. veto. They accused the United
States of ``total bias'' toward Israel.
   Palestinian contacts with American consulate officials have been
held periodically for the past two years, mainly to discuss the
political situation.
   ``What the United States did yesterday in the Security Council
was a shock, a slap at all those people who believe in peace in this
area,'' said Faisal Husseini, a pro-PLO activist in Jerusalem.
   Another Palestinian leader, Salah Khalaf, said the PLO will
``shed no tears'' if the United States breaks off dialogue with the
group because of the attempted raid.
   In condemning the abortive raid, the State Department left open
the possibility the incident could affect U.S. dialogue with the
PLO. That dialogue began after Arafat in 1988 denounced terrorism.
   ``We will not break off the dialogue, but if the United States
does, we won't be upset because we stand to lose nothing,'' said
Khalaf, second in command to Arafat in the PLO's mainstream Fatah
organization.
   He was quoted by the London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror. A
copy of the published interview was telefaxed to The Associated
Press in Bahrain.
   He repeated Arafat's claim that the PLO was not involved in the
raid.
   ``We are against the killing of innocent people of all
nationalities, but we cannot be expected to be the only ones who
stand against such killings,'' Khalaf said.
   ``When our people are slaughtered like sheep, let no one ask us
to be angels, to rise above our wounds and say, `Why did such an
operation take place?'''
   He was referring to the deaths of Palestinians during the
2{-year-old uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   At least 714 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians during the uprising. An additional 217 Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israel.

   West Germany and Luxembourg joined France on Friday
in banning British beef imports because of ``mad cow'' disease, but
the European Community offered to buy British meat to support that
nation's troubled cattle industry.
   France, which normally purchases more than half of exported
British beef, imposed a ban Wednesday. It said some meat might be
tainted by bovine spongiform encephalopathy, an incurable and fatal
nervous disorder.
   The disease, identified in Britain in 1986, is blamed for killing
13,648 cows there.
   West Germany had already barred imports of British beef still on
the bone but followed France by extending the ban to canned beef
Friday.
   Luxembourg later announced a ban on British beef imports, said an
EC Commission spokesman in Brussels.
   West Germany's Agriculture Ministry said in Bonn that it feared
British beef normally destined for France might be rerouted to West
Germany. A ban was necessary ``to protect consumers from
infection,'' the ministry said.
   But British officials accused France and Germany of seeking to
protect their domestic beef industries and exaggerating their
concern for public health.
   The bans are ``totally unjustified, unwarranted and contrary to
EC law,'' said Britain's Ministry of Agriculture spokesman.
   The president of Britain's National Farmer's Union, Sir Simon
Gourlay, called for a retaliatory ban of beef imports from all EEC
countries ``to bring the Community to its senses.''
   ``We cannot allow the situation to drag on through cynical
delaying tactics by some other governments,'' he said.
   European Community officials denounced France's ban Thursday as
illegal and demanded it be revoked.
   In Brussels, Belgium, EC headquarters said Friday the Community
would buy 20,600 tons of British beef to help prop up falling meat
prices.
   The British Meat and Livestock Commission said bans and fears
arising from ``mad cow'' disease were costing their industry about
$850,000 a day. Beef sales reportedly have fallen by about 30
percent in Britain.
   A team of French veterinarians sent to Britain to assess ``mad
cow'' disease returned Friday to submit its report. France's
Agriculture Ministry said no decision on the duration of the ban
would be made until after a meeting of the European Community's
veterinary committee.
   However, British agriculture officials said the committee meeting
had been postponed indefinitely.
   The cause of ``mad cow'' disease is unknown. Because the symptoms
are similar to scrapie, a sheep disease, it is assumed the disease
was transmitted through cattle feeds. They use sheep offal as a
protein supplement.

   Art treasures from five centuries of Russian
history and culture _ from the medieval to the avant-garde _ go on
display Saturday in their first exhibition outside the Soviet Union.
   More than 250 items are in ``Moscow: Treasures and Traditions,''
which runs through Sept. 30 at the Washington State Convention and
Trade Center.
   The unique collection, compiled from the Kremlin, Soviet state
museums and artists' studios, includes icons, engravings, metalwork,
porcelain, and historic costumes which have played important roles
in Russian history. Some highlights are:
   _A 15th century icon, ``Miracle of St. George and the Dragon,''
executed in egg tempera on wood.
   _A 17th century suit of chain mail armor and an early musket.
   _An altar cross donated to a monastery by Ivan the Terrible and a
helmet belonging to his son.
   The exhibit is making its world premiere here as the largest
component of the Goodwill Arts Festival, an international cultural
bash coinciding with this summer's Goodwill Games.
   ``With the many athletes coming from the Soviet Union, we wanted
to give the American public a broader understanding of this world
power we know little about,'' said C. David Hughbanks, managing
director of the exhibition.
   ``We've come to expect so-called `socialist art' where the
Russian tradition is concerned. This show offers a much broader
perspective, a whole history of the people of Moscow.''
   The collection illustrates historical events in Russian life in
seven separate themes, including the significance and place of
Christianity in 15th century Russian society. Other themes portray
the hopes, dreams, and realities of Soviet life, including the
desire for social reform.
   ``The exhibit is a celebration and a tribute to a city and its
people as seen through the eyes of artists and craftsmen, most of
whom are little known to the Western world,'' Hughbanks said.
   Officials from the Soviet Ministry of Culture and from four of
the 20 museums which lent their works to the exhibit accompanied the
art to Seattle.
   The exhibit will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C., beginning in November, before returning to the
Soviet Union in February 1991.

   Lech Walesa, himself a Nobel laureate,
suggested on Friday that the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize go to the people
of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia for their peaceful drive toward
independence from the Soviet Union.
   His proposal came in a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee,
PAP news agency said.
   Walesa won the award in 1983 for his role in creating the
independent Solidarity trade union three years earlier.
   ``Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are the countries that march on
the road to independence, all alone. With the passive attitude of
the world, they manifest in a very bold way, their attachment to the
ideas of freedom and self-determination of nations, ideas embodied
in the constitutions of all democratic nations,'' Walesa wrote.
   The three Baltic republics have declared their determination to
peacefully regain the independence lost when they were forcibly
incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Walesa and the Polish government and legislature have expressed
support for the right of the Baltic republics to self-determination,
but Poland has not officially recognized their new democratically
elected governments.

   The U.S. Embassy in El Salvador has reversed
itself and granted a visa to the top union official representing
Salvadoran coffee workers, Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y., said Friday.
   Scheuer said the embassy agreed Thursday to give a visa to Julio
Garcia Prieto, head of SICAFE, the union representing workers who
process coffee beans.
   ``This is a significant step toward creating a free, open
exchange of democratic ideals with the people of El Salvador,''
Scheuer said in announcing the visa.
   The U.S. Embassy had denied Garcia Prieto a visa because his
salary in El Salvador is so low, officials thought he might stay in
the United States after the visa expired, Scheuer said.
   Scheuer said Garcia Prieto would be visiting the United States
``in the very near future.''
   Scheuer, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Reps. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
Ed Towns, D-N.Y., Bill Green, R-N.Y., and Major Owens, D-N.Y.,
invited Garcia Prieto to visit them in Washington. Jack Sheinkman,
president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union,
also extended an invitation, Scheuer said.

<TEXT>
   It looks like another dry season in Southern
California _ except for those who work at Los Angeles County's
estimated 1,500 car washes.
   Up to 18 million cars a month routinely flow through car washes.
Operators expect more cars this year as residents are being asked to
cut water consumption by 10 percent because of the fourth straight
year of drought in the region.
   ``Even in a drought, people will still wash their cars,'' said
Gary Wimmer, who operates a dozen Southern California car washes.
``People like clean cars.''
   Especially people like Pat Sukove of North Hollywood.
   ``I bring it in every week, sometimes twice a week. I can't
afford not to take care of it. I waited a long time for this car,
it's my pride and joy,'' she said.
   Car washes are also benefitting from the Mediterranean fruit fly
infestation.
   That's because cars keep getting doused with a sticky mixture of
malathion pesticide and corn syrup bait that is sprayed from
helicopters in an effort to eradicate the pest. Spraying already has
driven business up at car washes by an estimated 20 percent to 40
percent as drivers wash their cars after each spraying, car wash
operators report.
   And car washes have received a boost from Metropolitan Water
District officials, who through their literature are encouraging car
owners to go to a car wash rather than wash cars on their own.
   That's because mechanical car washes use just a fraction of the
water used by the average motorist with a hose and bucket in the
driveway _ as little as 15{ gallons per car as opposed to 50 gallons
used by homeowners.

   Birmingham is going to the dogs Saturday,
with David Letterman regular Larry ``Bud'' Melman in the lead.
   Melman is to be grand marshal of the city's Do Dah Day parade and
judge of Birmingham's version of Stupid Pet Tricks, the competition
that NBC's ``Late Night With David Letterman'' made famous.
   It's all to benefit the Birmingham Humane Society, which raked in
$27,104 a year ago when Jessica Hahn was grand marshal.
   Asked what he'd look for, Melman said, ``Originality, I guess,''
as well as ``something completely different, off the beaten track,
like something David would do.''
   Owners whose pets can't do tricks _ stupid or otherwise _ will
have other chances to compete. Prizes will be awarded for
best-dressed dog, ugliest pet, best pet-owner look-alike, best
non-dog entry and most creatively dressed owner.
   Some people bring their own pets to the parade, but the humane
society is asking others to act as volunteer walkers for shelter
dogs.
   ``It's a good chance to get the dogs adopted and get them outside
in the sun and fresh air, where they can have some fun,'' said Bill
North, president of the society's board of directors. ``If we can
get even one animal adopted, it's well worth it.''
   Any pet, including ``two guppies in a fruit jar, or even a
mule,'' can take part in the parade, said activity director Hack
Lloyd. ``Last year we had a turtle and a duck.''
   Of the society's animals, only dogs are appearing in the parade,
North said, because ``it's rare that a cat will walk on a leash.
You'd end up dragging it down the street, and that just wouldn't
do.''

   President Bush will meet South Korean President
Roh Tae-woo of South Korea in Washington next Wednesday, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday.
   The meeting is to follow Monday's unprecedented meeting in San
Francisco between Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the
leader of South Korea.
   Soviet spokesman Arkady Maslennikov on Friday continued to avoid
confirming the Gorbachev-Roh plans already disclosed in Washington
and Seoul.
   Maslennikov said only ``no comment'' when a Korean journalist
asked him about the meeting and the reaction to it from communist
North Korea, a longtime Kremlin ally.
   On Thursday, Soviet spokesman Ivan Rumiantsev described word of
the meeting with Roh as ``a rumor.''
   The White House also announced that Bush will host Greece's new
prime minister, Constantine Mitsotakis. The visit marks the first
meeting between a U.S. president and a Greek prime minister in 26
years.
   The United States recently signed a new agreement for
continuation of U.S. bases in Greece.
   Bush will meet with Colombia's outgoing President Virgilio Barco
at the White House on Tuesday. Barco. who could not succeed himself,
leaves office in August. His is not an official working visit to
Washington, but he and Bush are expected to continue their previous
discussions on drug interdiction.
   Bush also plans to meet with United Nations Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar on Monday, Fitzwater said. Their talks will
likely cover the Middle East peace efforts and changes in Central
America.

   Mayberry fans can check out velvet hats with
white gloves, just like Aunt Bee would wear, a 1966 Studebaker and
many other items Saturday when they gather for a sale of the late
Frances Bavier's belongings.
   ``They're going to get a little bit of melancholy _ a little bit
of Aunt Bee, a little bit of Mayberry and a lot of memories,'' Sam
Williams, her attorney and close friend from Siler City, said Friday.
   Miss Bavier, who died in December at age 86, willed the contents
of her 22-room Siler City home to the UNC Center for Public
Television. More than 800 items will be offered during the sale.
   It's hard to tell how much money the sale at North Carolina State
University's McKimmon Center will generate, say public television
officials. The only financial estimate available is that 1,000
tickets to Friday's preview party were sold for $10 each.
   Some of the items _ such as Miss Bavier's contracts from ``The
Andy Griffith Show'' and episodes of ``Mayberry RFD'' _ have value
to collectors of vintage television memorabilia.
   Other items include funny little velvet hats with feathers and
pristine white gloves _ just like Aunt Bee might have worn.
   But others have a more tenuous connection, such as the
24-year-old Studebaker. Miss Bavier drove it for the last time in
1983 on a trip to the grocery store.
   ``Frances was like every other person in the world,'' says Durham
antique dealer Chris Allen, who is coordinating the sale. ``She had
wonderful things, and she had junky things.''
   Also being offered are Miss Bavier's personal belongings,
including bits of lace she collected on her travels around the
world, 1930s Queen Anne style furniture, Victorian antiques,
leather-bound books and original oil paintings.
   ``This is what she lived with and what she sat on and what she
ate, held and touched,'' says Priscilla Bratcher, director of
development and community relations for the UNC Center for Public
Television.
   Miss Bavier, born in New York, retired to Siler City in 1972.

<HEAD>20 Killed in Soviet Cable Car Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cable car broke loose Friday from an aerial
tramway at a popular tourist site in Soviet Georgia, and passengers
were hurled onto the roof of an apartment building. At least 20
people were reported killed.
   The Soviet news agency Tass and Soviet TV said another cable car
was involved in the accident, but details were unclear.
   The gondolas had been climbing along the tramway from downtown to
Mount Mtatsminda, a local tourist attraction, Tass said.
   Tass gave no specific death toll but witnesses and Iveria, an
unofficial Georgian information agency, said at least 20 people were
killed and 15 injured.
   Soviet TV showed footage of the accident's aftermath, including
the blood-splattered interior of one of the red-and-white gondolas.
The other gondola dangled from a cable above the apartment building
but appeared to have been ripped apart.
   ``One of the cars seemed to explode,'' said Graig Line, an
American photographer visiting Tbilisi who witnessed the accident.
``The car just disintegrated.''
   Iveria said, ``The leading steel cable burst and and one of the
two cars started to slide down, accelerating very quickly on the
other cable. Halfway down, the car collided with a support pole and
split in two at full speed.''
   According to Iveria, ``The passengers fell out of the car onto
the top of a six-story apartment building and into its yard.'' It
quoted the Georgian Interior Ministry as saying at least 20 people
died, including several soldiers and children, and another 15 were
injured.
   Iveria did not say what happened to the second cable car.
   Sergei Dandurov, a resident who witnessed the accident, said in a
telephone interview that the floor of the first cable car appeared
to have split open and passengers inside fell to the rooftop below.
He also said at least 20 people fell to their deaths.
   Tass said a government commission was formed to investigate the
cause of the accident.

   After tackling the 50th anniversary of the
Golden Gate Bridge, a public relations company has taken on the
enormous task of coordinating press coverage of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's visit _ for free.
   Other local companies donated eight extra phone lines and four
extra facsimile machines to help the PBN Co.'s staff field requests
from more than 1,000 media organizations who want credentials for
more than 3,000 journalists.
   ``It's hopping,'' PBN founder Peter Necarsulmer said Friday.
   Unlike the 1987 Golden Gate Bridge celebration, which took more
than a year to plan and earned PBN $600,000, Necarsulmer said he
learned of the Gorbachev visit less than two weeks ago.
   He hopes the event will bring the company exposure and more than
compensate for the long, free hours. If PBN were paid for this job,
he said, the fee would run ``very, very well into the six figures.''
   The work was going ``far better than I think anyone could've
anticipated,'' he said, noting that the federal government, city
officials, the White House, news media and security forces were
cooperating well.
   Veteran journalists said the real test of PBN's 24-member staff
will be Monday, when Gorbachev's schedule includes coffee with
former president Ronald Reagan, a quick trip to Stanford University,
a formal luncheon with business leaders in San Francisco, and a
possible meeting with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo.
   ``They seem to be doing okay,'' said San Francisco Examiner
Deputy Metro Editor Don Thornton. ``There seems to be so many
changes and fixes, it's been a nightmare for us.''
   ``They've got an impossible job,'' said Thornton. ``So far,
they're meeting the challenge ... We'll know Monday.''
   ``They've got a lot more to lose than gain.''
   About 20 people from rival public relations agencies volunteered
their time to help plan Gorbachev's visit.
   ``It's amazing,'' said PBN account assistant Amy Pew. ``People
just really wanted to work on this.''
   Sleep has been hard to come by.
   ``I got some last night. I think I got two hours,'' said
Necarsulmer. ``But I'm feeling good. I have enough adrenaline to get
me through to Tuesday morning. Which is why I, more than anyone
else, hope the Gorbachevs make their plane Monday night.''
   Not everyone will get press credentials. Small pools of reporters
and photographers will be allowed to cover events, leaving others to
watch on closed-circuit television.
   ``You won't believe how many photographers will claim they work
for Life magazine,'' said Necarsulmer.

   President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev hit
last-minute snags on a landmark nuclear weapons agreement Friday as
the Soviet leader pressed fervently for U.S. concessions on trade.
Nevertheless, they were ready to sign an agreement slashing chemical
weapon stockpiles.
   The unexpected impediments to the arms agreement marred an
outwardly friendly summit, and spokesmen said they were hopeful the
problems could be worked out. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Soviet foreign minister Eduard Shevardnadze were called in to
troubleshoot.
   The second day of superpower summitry appeared marked by tough
bargaining by Gorbachev. Missing from a White House list of
agreements to be signed were the arms accord, a grain-sale agreement
sought by American farmers and the trade treaty that Gorbachev wants.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, who met with Gorbachev, said
the Soviet leader ``desperately wants some give on the trade side.''
However, he said Congress was equally insistent that Lithuania must
win freedom from Moscow before making economic concessions.
   ``I think he feels that if he doesn't get it, he's going home
empty-handed,'' Dole said. Gorbachev, besieged by mounting economic
problems, said a gesture on trade would be useful for him at home.
   Both sides expressed confidence that the outlines of an agreement
for the first-ever reductions in long-range nuclear weapons would be
signed before the summit ends on Sunday.
   Bush and Gorbachev themselves hinted at difficulties after their
morning talks, but their relaxed demeanor gave no indication of
major stumbling blocks.
   ``We always have complications but we measure it not by the glass
as half-empty or the glass is half full,'' Bush said. At his side,
Gorbachev said they had made ``a lot of progress.''
   Despite problems with a strategic weapons pact, the leaders were
ready to sign the separate accord imposing a halt in production of
chemical weapons and requiring the two nations to cut their poison
gas stockpiles to 5,000 tons each.
   Bush and Gorbachev also were unable to make progress on cutting
troops and non-nuclear weapons in Europe. They issued a statement
declaring ``early conclusion'' of an agreement was ``essential to
the future stability and security of the continent.''
   Bush had initially hoped to extract a commitment from Gorbachev
at this week's summit on conventional arms cutbacks, but differences
between the two sides remained.
   On a related front, sources said Gorbachev, trying to break a
stalemate, had proposed creation of a new ``Council of all Europe''
to play a decisive role in shaping the military future of Germany.
The United States and the Soviet Union would participate in the
deliberations along with other members of the NATO and Warsaw Pact
alliances as well as neutral countries.
   A U.S. official said, ``We are prepared to work with it. It is
not something we would reject out of hand.'' The idea will be
considered by top diplomatic aides in Copenhagen and Berlin later
this month.
   The second day of summitry was punctuated by Gorbachev scolding
congressional leaders for stalling trade benefits for Moscow.
   ``We are not asking for a free ride,'' Gorbachev said. He said it
would be ``humilitating'' to beg for concessions.
   A trade treaty would be a politically important symbol for
Gorbachev, burdened by deepening economic woes. U.S. officials said
the Soviets were holding hostage an agreement to buy American grain
_ a boost to U.S. farmers _ as a bargaining chip for the trade deal.
   Gorbachev said a gesture from the United States on trade would be
``especially politically'' useful for him at home. The United States
wants the Soviets to ease pressure on breakaway Lithuania and
guarantee protection for Jewish emigration.
   By itself, a trade agreement has little value. However, it is
part of a package leading to most-favored-nation trade status, which
would drastically reduce U.S. tariffs on Soviet goods.
   The superpower summit was spiced with colorful sideshows. Barbara
Bush and Raisa Gorbachev were cheered at Wellesley College
commencement exercises and Gorbachev once again stopped his
entourage to work the noon-hour crowds on a brilliant sunny day.
   Both women spoke of traditional values at Wellesley. Mrs. Bush,
whose selection as a graduation speaker had irritated some students,
counseled them to put family and friends first in their lives. Mrs.
Gorbachev said women have a special mission of ``peacemaking,
humanism, mercy and kindness.''
   Gorbachev began the day by confronting some of his toughest
critics in Washington _ congressional leaders unhappy over Moscow's
coercion of Lithuania, the Baltic republic struggling for
independence. Televised live across America, it was a freewheeling
exchange over trade, German unity, Lithuania and Soviet economic
reforms.
   Gorbachev took the offensive. He said Bush was too rigid about
insisting that a unified Germany be a member of NATO, and rejected
any suggestion that he was politically weak. ``That's not serious,''
he said.
   ``This is a genuine revolution,'' Gorbachev told the lawmakers,
some of whom have expressed doubts that he will survive. ``Please
don't be frightened, because you can frighten us, too, if you get
frightened.''
   Extolling his economic reforms, Gorbachev said increased trade
with the West would be an important step toward a free market system
in the Soviet Union.
   However, Gorbachev lectured, ``I'm not going to ask for anything,
to beg for anything. ... Certainly we are not asking for a free
ride. We will be asking for normal credits, and of course we will be
paying, and paying the interest. For us it would humiliating if we
were to ask, to beg for something from you.''
   When congressmen pressed him on Lithuania, Gorbachev pointed out
that China had received most-favored-nation status despite the
bloody crackdown in Tiananmen Square a year ago. ``Maybe we should
introduce martial rule in the Baltics,'' he said sarcastically.
   The agreement on strategic weapons, the deadliest arms in the
superpowers' arsenals, has been under negotiation for eight years.
It would be the first to reduce long-range nuclear arms; previous
agreements set overall limits but still allowed more weapons to be
made.
   Even after both sides initial a treaty outline, the superpowers
will face months of tedious negotiations over details to satisfy
lawyers in each country.
   Overall, both sides would agree to destroy about a third of their
long-range nuclear weapons over seven years.
   The chemical weapons pact would require the United States to
destroy about 20,000 tons of its stockpile and mandate a 45,000 ton
reduction by the Soviet Union. The United States also would be
required to stop producing poison gas; the Soviet Union already has
stopped.
   Along with the arms agreements, there also were accords expanding
air travel between the United States and Soviet Union, increasing
student exchanges, and making it easier for commercial ships to
deliver goods to ports in one another's country.
   There was an agreement for closer cooperation on atomic energy
and another to open reciprocal cultural and information centers in
Washington and Moscow.

   Federal health officials said Friday they
support a drug prevention program that focuses on changing the way
communities view drug use _ legal and illegal _ rather than merely
telling youngsters to say no.
   ``This program is unique because it utilizes all components in
the community _ schools, parents, the media and community groups _
which contribute to changing the social norms for drug use and
providing a healthy drug-free environment for all people,'' said
Charles R. Schuster, director of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse.
   Schuster's agency helped pay for an evaluation of the Midwestern
Drug Abuse Prevention Research Project, a just-completed five-year
study in Kansas City and Indianapolis by researchers from the
University of Southern California.
   Researchers began tracking 5,500 teen-agers when they were in the
sixth and seventh grades in 50 Kansas City schools and studied a
similar group at 57 schools in Indiana.
   Among the major findings:
   _36 percent of the students who participated in the program, now
high school juniors and seniors, said they drank alcohol in the last
month, while 50.1 percent of those not in the program admitted the
same behavior.
   _24.1 percent of the participating students smoked cigarettes in
the last month, compared with 32 percent of those who didn't receive
the program's prevention messages.
   _14.2 percent of the program students smoked marijuana in the
past month, compared with 20.2 percent of those in a control group.
   A preliminary analysis of eight of the study schools found that
1.6 percent of the program students used cocaine in the last month,
compared with 3.7 percent of those not in the program.
   Schuster said if the same percentage difference on cocaine use
were applied nationally, it would mean 500,000 fewer teen-agers were
using cocaine.
   Mary Ann Pentz, one of the University of California researchers,
said reducing alcohol use among teen-agers was the most challenging
because it's more widely accepted in society than tobacco or illegal
drugs.
   ``Probably how to resist drugs is not as simple as just saying
no,'' she said.
   Another researcher, C. Anderson Johnson, said a key to reducing
harmful drug use is to engineer ``a shift in the perception of
social sanctions, especially among peers.'' In other words, ``how
will your friends respond?''
   He said teen-agers often don't have a clear idea of the degree to
which their peers respond to drug use and that one of the many
facets of the program tried in Kansas City and Indianapolis was to
use classroom exercises to bring about a consensus of how drug use
is viewed.

   An artist Friday offered to change the title of
his sculpture ``Hunky Steelworker,'' and the festival displaying it
agreed, quieting criticism by steelworkers and ethnic groups
offended by the name.
   The 12-foot-tall statue is the most prominently displayed
sculpture in the Three Rivers Arts Festival, which opened downtown
Friday.
   Croatians and other Eastern Europeans in western Pennsylvania's
steel towns consider the term ``hunky'' a slur.
   ``It's not the art, it's just the word `hunky,''' said John P.
Plesh, secretary-treasurer of the Croatian Fraternal Union. ``The
statue is nice.''
   The stocky, fiberglass statue erected last month at Point State
Park wears a dour expression and a rust-colored hat, and stands in
front of a large fountain. It is to be on display until the festival
ends June 17.
   The city's controller noticed the title while jogging, and held a
news conference next to the statue last week to decry the use of
what he considers an ethnic insult.
   The artist, Luis Jimenez of Hondo, N.M., said Friday he had hired
a fiberglass company to scour the word ``Hunky'' from the base of
the statue.
   The term originated in the late 1800s to describe people of
Hungarian descent, but its use was expanded quickly as an insult
toward anyone whose ancestors came from central Europe, said Sarah
Thomason, a professor of linguistics at the University of Pittsburgh.
   Many Eastern Europeans emigrated to Pittsburgh around the turn of
the century to work in the city's dozens of steel mills.
   Ms. Thomason said the term is similar in origin as ``honky,''
which some blacks have used to describe whites.
   Jimenez said no offense was intended.
   ``I was trying to pay homage to the men who worked at the steel
mills,'' Jimenez said. ```Millhunk' was a term I had come across in
my research at the library.''
   Six organizations who protested the title issued a statement
thanking Jimenez for changing the title.
   ``We thank Luis Jimenez for his sensitive handling of this
situation,'' said mediator Ann Begler, reading a statement from the
groups. ``By offering to cover the word, `Hunky,' he has made his
sculpture a real tribute to Steelworkers of all backgrounds in this
region.''
   Jimenez said the decision wasn't difficult after realizing the
magnitude of the flap.
   ``There is a portion of the community who was upset and there are
some wounds there,'' Jimenez said. Titles of sculptures are meant
only as a guide to the work, not as the work itself, he said.
   ``When the artist was making his original statements, we
supported him, and when he wanted to change that, we allowed him to
do that,'' said Jeanne Pearlman, executive director of the festival.
   Fraternal groups representing Croatians, Poles, blacks and other
minorities said the matter benefited the community by prompting them
to work together. The Pennsylvania Heritage Affairs Commission and
the United Steelworkers union also signed the statement.
   ``The artist was the most amenable about the whole thing. Mr.
Jimenez made the issue easy for resolution,'' said Steelworkers
spokesman Gary Hubbard.
   Jimenez said he was disappointed with the response to his work.
   ``I wanted to raise certain issues about the contributions
steelworkers have made. I hoped it would be viewed with a sense of
pride,'' Jimenez said.

   There were a few fast words at the
Palace, but not from the Detroit Pistons. Blame another hometown
favorite this time: Madonna.
   ``What are you doing? Trying to make me look bad to my
hometown?'' the singer joked as she tussled with two women backup
singers during her soldout show. ``What does a girl from Detroit
know to do? She knows how to fight.''
   During her one-hour, 40-minute performance Thursday night,
Madonna put on the usual moves, with spirited dancing and
ever-changing revealing costumes. The concert was part of her
``Blond Ambition'' tour.
   The 31-year-old singer and actress graduated from suburban
Detroit's Rochester Adams High School and attended the University of
Michigan before heading to New York City to pursue a career in show
business.

   Charley Pride says he can relate to flood
victims in Liberty County because his boyhood home in Mississippi
was also flooded.
   ``I remember my dad taking me on his bike and getting us to
higher ground. we had floodwater coming up to our house,'' the
country singer said Thursday after touring the area.
   Pride, who serves as national entertainment chairman for the Red
Cross, surveyed the length of the flooded Trinity River and later
visited a family assistance center in Hardin. He helped Red Cross
volunteers fill out forms and distribute cleanup kits or provisions
to flood victims.
   ``It just hurts to see,'' he said. ``It's not like I haven't
experienced it myself. It's not like wondering how it feels. I come
from that kind of background. You know, shotgun houses and snakes
and ants and et cetera.''
   Pride gave autographs and in some cases signed the cardboard
assistance packages handed out to victims at the center.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev received
five humanitarian awards from varied U.S. groups Friday and said the
recognition is ``a great incentive to me in what I'm doing.''
   ``It is said that face-to-face sometimes you cannot see the face,
and that the big things are seen from a distance,'' Gorbachev said
during one of the low-key presentations in an ornate room at the
Soviet Embassy. ``We value highly that you have seen something from
a distance.''
   Speaker after speaker, addressing dignitaries and celebrities
packed sardine-style in the small, gilded and paneled room, said
Gorbachev has proved that one person can change the course of
history.
   As he sat impassive in a brocade chair, they called him creative,
courageous and visionary. They said he had ``shattered the Cold
War,'' brought freedom to Eastern Europe and inspired ``epic
reforms'' in his own country.
   ``Your name will be forever identified with the world's leaders
who have fearlessly sought peace, justice and a better life for all
of the peoples of the earth,'' said William J. vanden Heuvel,
president of the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute.
   Gorbachev, who spoke in a low, subdued voice without notes after
receiving each award, said he felt very emotional. ``I understand my
role and my mission in my land and with my people,'' he said. ``And
nothing will let me deviate from that course to which I am
committed.''
   The issue of Lithuanian secession did not come up during the
ceremonies, and officials of the groups making the awards said
Gorbachev's response to that crisis has not shaken their faith in
him.
   Hans Janitschek of Friends World College, which gave him a peace
prize, said one or two board members wondered what would happen if
Gorbachev were to move into Lithuania with troops.
   ``I assured them he would not do that,'' Janitschek said. ``This
is exactly why he is being honored. He is not using violence. ... If
we had assumed that he could do this, our whole concept of proposing
him for the award would have been wrong.''
   As for the economic embargo against Lithuania, he said, ``We
don't regard that as violence, as regrettable as it is.''
   Vanden Heuvel, a former deputy ambassador to the United Nations,
said Lithuania will ultimately benefit from Gorbachev's policies
just as did the countries of Eastern Europe.
   ``We believe that President Gorbachev is for the independence of
Lithuania,'' he said. ``It's a matter of time and procedure.''
   These are the awards Gorbachev received:
   _The Albert Einstein Peace Prize, a $50,000 award which once went
to the late human rights champion Andrei Sakharov. There was no
immediate word on what Gorbachev would do with the money. It was
presented by former arms negotiator Paul Warnke, who joked that
``never in my wildest dreams'' did he think he would ever have a
chance to give a check to the leader of the Soviet Union.
   _The Franklin Delano Roosevelt Freedom Medal for promotion of
FDR's ``four freedoms'' _ freedom of speech and expression, freedom
of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. Vanden Heuvel
and author Norman Cousins presented the medal.
   _The Martin Luther King Jr. Non-Violent Peace Prize for 1991 from
the King Center for Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta. Coretta
Scott King presented a $1,000 check and a medallion bearing King's
words and likeness.
   _The ``Man of History'' award from the Appeal of Conscience
Foundation, a group of religious and business leaders. The award was
a Steuben glass crystal, presented by Rabbi Arthur Schneier after he
pronounced a blessing on Gorbachev.
   _The Martin Luther King Jr. International Peace Award from
Friends World College, a small Quaker school in New York. The award,
a silver sculpture of a dove encircling the globe, once went to
former Costa Rican president Oscar Arias. He was at the ceremony on
Friday and met Gorbachev.

   A court on Friday ordered the arrest of
a high-ranking policeman in connection with the abduction and
shooting death of a journalist who crusaded against human rights
violations in Sri Lanka.
   The order came after the mother of journalist Richard de Zoysa
claimed Senior Police Superintendent Ronnie Gunasinghe was one of
the six men who had kidnapped her son from his home in a Colombo
suburb Feb. 18. His body was found two days later on a beach in
Moratuwa, 10 miles south of Colombo.
   The government has denied any police or military involvement in
the incident.
   De Zoysa, 33, was a correspondent for the Rome-based Inter Press
Service. Colombo newspapers reported Friday that the news agency and
the Inter Press Institute will present their 1990 award for
outstanding performance to de Zoysa as a ``small tribute to the
courageous journalistic struggle de Zoysa waged against human rights
violations in Sri Lanka.''
   De Zoysa, a Sri Lankan, was the first journalist working for a
foreign news organization to be killed in Sri Lanka.
   Moratuwa district magistrate Rohini Walagama asked police
investigators to bring Gunasinghe to court by June 11.
   ``I have succeeded personally in identifying Ronnie Gunasinghe,''
said the affidavit by Manorami Saravanamuttu, de Zoysa's mother, who
added she has received death threats.
   ``I have restrained from divulging any information to the police
because of concern about my own safety and because I have no faith
in the investigation the police claim they are conducting,'' the
statement said.
   Since 1987, hundreds of civilians suspected of having links with
Sinhalese extremists have been killed. The government blamed many of
the deaths on pro-government vigilante groups.
   Most of the front's senior leaders were captured and killed late
last year.
   The front began attacking the government after accusing it of
giving too many concessions to militants from the Tamil minority,
who had been fighting since 1983 for a separate homeland.
   About 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people are Tamils.
Sinhalese account for 75 percent of the population.

   President Rafael Angel Calderon
announced an austerity plan that will slash government expenses and
raise rates for public services to help bring down the deficit.
   In a nationwide radio and television broadcast late Wednesday,
Calderon said the government deficit has rise to more than $320
million this year, more than 6 percent of the gross domestic product
of this Central American country of 2.9 million residents.
   ``This massive deficit forces us to take necessary, although
hard, measures, to avoid the painful tax of inflation,'' he said.
   The government austerity policy will reduce spending by $70
million this year, he said, forcing an increase in the price of
fuel, electricity, water and telephone services.
   To help reduce the impact of some of the price hikes, a food
assistance plan and other aid programs will be increased, he said.
   Since taking office May 8, Calderon has made reducing the deficit
a main priority. In 1989, under President Oscar Arias, the deficit
was about $220 million, or 4 percent of the gross domestic product.
   Inflation was 9.9 percent in 1989, according to the government.
Private economists say it could reach 20 percent for this year.
   Calderon has claimed the 1989 inflation rate released by the
government was kept artificially low because it was an election year.

<TEXT>
   South Koreans are applauding the first
meeting between a South Korean and a Soviet leader as a milestone
that will spur dramatic new dialogue with communist North Korea.
   Presidents Roh Tae-woo and Mikhail S. Gorbachev are to meet in
San Francisco next Monday after Gorbachev ends summit talks with
President Bush.
   Seoul and Moscow have no diplomatic relations. The meeting was in
the works for at least two months and has the blessing of the U.S.
government, news reports said.
   Roh said the talks will be aimed at helping end hostility on the
Korean peninsula, bitterly divided since 1945 into communist North
and capitalist South. Koreans hope eased tensions will lead to
unification.
   The border between the two Koreas is sealed and more than 1
million troops are deployed behind barbed wire on either side.
Washington and Moscow have exerted pressure on their respective
allies in Seoul and North Korea's capital of Pyongyang to pursue
dialogue. Little progress has been made.
   ``Since there is no way opened for me to go to Pyongyang, I have
to go there by way of Moscow,'' said Roh.
   In Seoul, the stock market shot up on news of the Roh-Gorbachev
meeting. A Soviet trade show was flooded with Koreans as intent on
buying vodka as inspecting technology. Political leaders and
editorials hailed the meeting as an extraordinary moment in Korean
history.
   North Korea released a statement, monitored in Tokyo, suggesting
it may end its boycott of dialogue with South Korea. It said, ``The
only way of solving the question of national unification in a
peaceful way ... is to develop dialogue.''
   Roh's popularity, which plunged in recent months due to labor
unrest and economic worries, overnight appeared to rise.
   ``I believe (the meeting) will bring an epochal change in
relations between South and North Korea,'' said Kim Dae-jung, head
of the leading opposition Party for Peace and Democracy. ``I welcome
it as a sign of great progress.''
   Kim Young-sam, the leader of the governing Democratic Justice
Party who met Gorbachev in Moscow last March, predicted ``a major
breakthrough will be made in relations between the two countries.''
   Kim also said the Soviet Union was expected ``to exercise
influence upon the North to adopt an open-door or reformist policy.''
   ``The projected summit will mark a historic milestone in the
development of the Korean-Soviet relationship that was never dreamed
of only a few months ago,'' the Korea Times said.
   The dissident United National Movement for Democracy said that
isolating North Korea could delay unification and urged Roh to
discuss total withdrawal of nuclear arms and foreign troops from the
peninsula.
   Radicals and dissidents demand withdrawal of 43,000 U.S. troops
based in South Korea, saying their presence hinders dialogue on
unification. North Korea demands the United States withdraw nuclear
weapons it says are kept in South Korea.
   The meeting represents the culmination of South Korea's
``northern policy,'' which is aimed at fostering ties with communist
nations able to influence North Korea.
   The talks come at a time when economic ties between Seoul and
Moscow are rapidly increasing. Their two-way trade doubled to $600
million last year.
   Korean news reports said former U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz and Anatoly Dobrynin, former Soviet ambassador in Washington
and a personal adviser to Gorbachev, helped arrange the talks.

<HEAD>United States Returns Military Base to Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO HATO, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the bases of Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega's defeated Panamanian Defense Forces was returned to Panama
on Thursday by the U.S. military.
   Panamanian authorities said the Rio Hato military base, 75 miles
southwest of Panama City and surrounded by Pacific beaches, will be
turned into a tourist site.
   The base had been under control of the United States since
American troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to capture Noriega, the
former Panamanian strongman who is now in Miami awaiting trial on
federal drug charges.
   His Defense Forces were abolished and are being replaced by a
civilian police force under the government of President Guillermo
Endara.
   It was the second base returned to Panama this week. Earlier, the
Panamanian portion of Fort Amador, which the United States shared
with Panama, was returned to Panama.
   The Jose Espinar Military College in the Atlantic port of Colon
has not been returned to Panamanian control, nor has the remaining
American-occupied portion of Fort Amador.
   Fort Amador housed some of Noriega's main offices. Rio Hato,
which has a large landing strip, was a military school and home of
the crack Machos del Monte battalion, which put down an attempted
coup against Noriega in October.
   Rio Hato also was a key American installation during World War II.
   Ramon Lima, vice minister of the interior and justice, said at
Thursday's ceremony that the base would be turned into an area
``attractive to national and international tourism'' and would be
administered by Panamanian tourism officials for hotel construction.

   Republican leadership backed a
black candidate for lieutenant governor Friday in a raucous news
conference disrupted by his primary election opponent, a white
supremacist.
   Kenneth ``Muskie'' Harris, a black who forced Ralph Forbes into a
June 12 runoff for the nomination, said Forbes lied this week when
he said Harris supports women's rights to have abortions.
   ``Who's lining up behind my opponent?'' Harris said, while
flanked by Bob Leslie, GOP national committeeman, three Republican
politicians and two members of Arkansas pro-life groups. ``The KKK.
The Nazis? I don't see anyone.''
   Forbes, a white supremacist and former American Nazi leader who
won 46 percent of the vote in the GOP primary Tuesday, says he
doesn't think blacks and whites belong in the same government.
   ``I believe that racial separation is ultimately the right
answer,'' Forbes said Thursday.
   Another avowed racist _ who served prison time for bombing a
black church _ is running for lieutenant governor as a Democrat in
Georgia. J.B. Stoner has prompted debate among fellow candidates
over whether to boycott forums he attends.
   And in Louisiana, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard
who last year was elected to the state House in an upset, is seeking
the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate. The House this week passed a
bill sponsored by Duke that would ban affirmative action.
   When Forbes appeared at the news conference Friday, Leslie said
the conference room at a North Little Rock bank was reserved for
Harris and refused to allow Forbes to follow his opponent at the
podium.
   Forbes then went in the hallway and stood in front of the
elevators to answer questions. He said he still speaks at Nazi and
Ku Klux Klan gatherings.
   ``I'm an American nationalist. You burn the American flag and
I'll stop you. That's right. Call me a Nazi, fine. Just spell my
name right,'' Forbes told reporters.
   ``You're a Nazi,'' said Robert Jespersen, standing behind a mass
of reporters. Jespersen later said he is a Little Rock lawyer and
former Marine who happened to be in the building.
   ``I said I'm an American nationalist, you're right,'' Forbes
responded.
   ``You're a Nazi,'' Jespersen said. ``You're a member of the
American Nazi Party.''
   ``I'm an American nationalist, you're right,'' Forbes said.
   ``I don't think it's time for the Republican Party to have a Nazi
run their platform,'' Jespersen said.
   Earlier, Harris insisted he supports the Republican platform on
abortion. He read from the platform, which says an unborn child has
a fundamental right to life. Later, Harris said he supported
abortion only in the cases of incest and rape.
   Forbes said Harris made pro-choice statements at a lieutenant
governor's debate that got little media attention May 10. Darrell
Glascock, a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor who lost
the primary, said later Friday that he also heard Harris give a
pro-choice statement.
   But both Glascock and Forbes confirmed that Glascock was
considering being Forbes' campaign manager. ``I like him and his
family,'' Glascock said, adding that he wasn't sure yet if he agreed
with Forbes' politics. ``That's what I'm looking at now.''
   Later in the day, Forbes had a questionnaire delivered to The
Associated Press in which Harris answered in favor of abortions on
demand. Harris said he couldn't remember filling out the form for
the Lakeside Baptist Church at Hot Springs. He said he must have
accidentally put an ``X'' under the ``Yes'' column for a question
about abortion on demand.
   ``I'm right in line with George Bush'' on the abortion issue, he
said.
   Forbes said he will protect white and black unborn children
equally.

   Here is the text of remarks by President Bush
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the signing ceremony
Friday in the East Room of the White House:
   Bush: President Gorbachev, again, welcome to the White House. Mr.
President, you and I set a course six months ago off the island
nation of Malta. And at that time we agreed on an agenda, much of
which was completed for this week's summit. Of course our Malta
agenda remains unfinished, but we've made great progress in the last
six months and in the last two days.
   We're about to sign agreements concerning many areas of vital
interest to our countries and to the world, and to record specific
understanding in joint statements that are being published today.
   First, we'll sign a bilateral agreement that will for the first
time eliminate the great majority of the chemical weapons that our
countries have stockpiled over the years. And let this landmark
agreement quickly lead to a global ban on chemical weapons.
   Secondly, we will be signing protocols on limiting nuclear
testing. After long, sometimes arduous negotiations, we both agreed
on unprecedented improvements for on-site verification of the
Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty.
   Third, we will sign a major new agreement that updates and
expands our 1973 agreement on the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
   This new agreement provides for substantial U.S.-Soviet
cooperation in atomic energy research and civilian nuclear safety.

   As if testifying in his own defense, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev held forth for an hour-and-half Friday,
answering congressional questioners on everything from the
Lithuanian embargo to the price of Soviet bread.
   He reasoned with them, cajoled, lectured, confessed. And just
hours after his stunning televised performance, he won from
President Bush the trade agreement he had hoped to take home from
the summit.
   It is still subject to congressional approval, and the lawmakers
suggested that wouldn't come easily as long as the Soviet embargo on
Lithuania remains in effect.
   The pact wouldn't have an instant impact, Gorbachev told the
lawmakers he had invited to breakfast at the Soviet Embassy, but it
would open the way for American business people to participate in
the Soviet Union's economic development.
   ``You should do some rethinking of how to act so as not to impede
trade,'' he told the leaders, arguing that ``a Soviet Union which is
weak, torn by complexes and problems and turmoil'' is more
threatening to the United States than ``a dynamic Soviet state that
is open to the outside world.''
   He admitted that when he launched Perestroika five years ago, he
thought he could fix the Communist system with some tinkering, such
as adding private cooperatives and permitting farm leasing. But it
didn't work.
   ``Really, we were being very naive,'' he said. ``In our system,
it was just impossible. There was no incentive, there was no
motivation for people to work.''
   But to change the economic system, he said, he had to institute
democracy to create pressure on the authorities to change.
   That proved so effective that ``in some regions, the entire
ruling structures were swept aside by the political wave,'' and the
old system was dismantled before a new one could be put in place.
   ``Our ship has lost anchor, and therefore we're all a little
sick,'' the president said, describing the present confusion and
turmoil in his country. He said that if the government doesn't move
quickly to establish the new market-oriented economy he has
proposed, the whole society will suffer.
   Gorbachev laid out for his congressional audience the enormity of
his task, involving creation of new forms of ownership, including
private property once considered anathema to communists.
   ``We need competitiveness in our economy, and that is why we will
be adopting laws on entrepreneurship, on small and medium-size
business. We do not have a system of markets. We do not have systems
of stock exchanges, monetary or labor exchanges. So we have to be
developing an entire infrastucture for the market.''
   Tripling the price of bread even before the market is in place as
an unpopular step, he conceded, but he insisted that bread is so
cheap and plentiful in the Soviet Union that ``kids play football
with loaves of bread, feed bread to cattle, and it's really
outrageous.''
   Congress has urged President Bush not to sign a trade agreement
with the Soviet Union until it lifts its embargo of Lithuania, which
has declared its independence.
   In an exhaustive account of the Lithuanian crisis and his efforts
to solve it, Gorbachev said the Lithuanian parliament had rushed its
own election process and staged a ``nighttime coup d'etat'' to
secede from the union.
   Similar pressures exist in many Soviet republics, he said, and
Lithuania can't be dealt with alone, ignoring its own minority
nationalities and territorial claims by other republics.
   Gorbachev described himself as taking a conciliatory stance,
willing to negotiate with the Lithuanians and work out procedures
for eventual independence. But he insisted the republic must submit
to a popular referendum and respect the rights of its ethnic
minorities, including Russians and Poles.
   He chided Congress for permitting Bush to invade Panama,
suggesting that move also was unconstitutional and failed to respect
the popular will of the Panamanians.
   Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, interrupted with a retort that
``there are very significant differences in the two situations'' and
suggesting the Lithuanian declaration _ like the Panama invasion _
had overwhelming popular support.
   ``All right, all right,'' he said. ``Fine. Fine. Fine. Let them
do it, and we'll agree _ but only through a constitutional process.''
   Asked to explain why the Soviet Legislature had not yet adopted a
law liberalizing emigration, Gorbachev protested that the U.S.
Congress was getting too deeply involved in his country's domestic
affairs.
   ``This is a matter of dignity, this is a matter of prestige, this
is a matter of sovereignty and national dignity, so please be
careful about this,'' he said. But he went on to answer the
question, saying the emigration law ``has been adopted on first
reading. Its provisions are in effect. ... If you look at the
reality of the situation, its provisions are in effect. The flow of
emigres from Soviet Union is practically not braked. You know that
this is no longer a problem.''
   He suggested Congress was ``looking for a pretext in order to put
a brake on this process of adopting most-favored-nation treatment''
that would lower tariff barriers for Soviet products sold in the
United States.
   Asked how Congress could help, Gorbachev pleaded for ``a
favorable gesture'' on trade. And he asked for extension of credit
to finance joint ventures and the conversion to a market economy,
making it ``easier for us during this difficult period.'' He
promised to start paying back the money within seven years.
   He accused the United States of applying a double standard by
withholding MFN status from the Soviet Union while granting it to
China after the crushing of the democratic movement in Tiananmen
Square.
   ``Maybe we should introduce presidential rule in the Baltics and
at least fire some rounds,'' he suggested wryly.

   Here, at a glance, are the U.S.-Soviet
agreements announced Friday by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at a White House ceremony:
   _A ``framework'' accord on the major elements of a Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty, or START, to reduce each side's arsenal of
long-range nuclear weapons by about one-third over a 7-year period.
   _An accord ending production of U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons
and eliminating all but 5,000 tons of their existing chemical
stockpiles. The deal is meant as a catalyst for a global agreement
to ban production and possession of these weapons.
   _A trade agreement that would move the superpowers closer to
normal commercial relations, but still stop short of
most-favored-nation status.
   _A protocol spelling out anti-cheating measures for existing
treaties that limit nuclear tests. The verification protocol will
permit both nations to ratify the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and
the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, which limit U.S. and
Soviet underground nuclear tests to 150 kilotons.
   _An agreement expanding commercial air travel between the United
States and the Soviet Union by adding four American and six Soviet
cities to current airliner routes. It also will allow one more
Soviet and six more U.S. airlines to run the routes.
   _A new 5-year atomic energy agreement to provide closer
cooperation in nuclear reactor safety, fusion energy and basic
atomic science.
   _A grain deal committing the Soviets to buying at least 10
million tons annually, starting next year, of U.S. wheat, feed
grains and soybeans. That is an increase of 1 million tons annually
from a current agreement that took effect in 1983.
   _A maritime transportation pact to make it easier for U.S. and
Soviet commercial vessels to deliver goods to ports in one another's
country.
   _An agreement to open reciprocal cultural and information centers
in Washington and Moscow.
   _The first government-to-government agreement to increase student
exchanges between the two countries.

   In addition, President Gorbachev and I are issuing a joint
statement recording major agreed provisions of a strategic arms
reduction treaty as well as a joint statement in which we agree to
future negotiations on nuclear and space arms designed to enhance
stability and reduce the risk of war.
   We're also issuing a statement on the conventional armed forces
in Europe, committing us to intensify the pace of the Vienna
negotiations and to reach rapid agreement on all outstanding issues.
   You see, we agree that a (conventional armed forces) treaty is an
indispensable foundation for the future of European security.
   There are many other agreements the United States (is) signing or
announcing during this summit _ agreements that represent hard work
and a lasting achievement, not just by our governments, but also for
the peoples.
   For example, an agreement to establish a U.S.-Soviet park across
the Bering Strait. This park will preserve the unique, natural
environmental and cultural heritage of the Bering Sea region of
Alaska and Siberia. Just as a bridge of land once joined our two
continents, so let a bridge of hope now reach across the water, to
join our two peoples in this spirit of peaceful cooperation.
   In that same spirit President Gorbachev and I'll sign an
agreement that realizes our Malta objective of expanding
undergraduate exchanges by 1,000 students on both sides.
   Allowing more of our young people to experience first-hand each
other's culture and politics. To live as friends, and out of simple
acts of friendship a profound revelation eventually arises, the
people of the world have more in common than they have in conflict.
   In just a few moments Secretary of State Baker and Foreign
Minister Shevardnadze will also sign four important new agreements
concerning maritime boundaries, ocean studies, civil aviation and a
long-term grains agreement.
   Minister Shevardnadze and Transportation Secretary Skinner will
sign a fifth agreement on maritime transportation. And President
Gorbachev and I are also signing a commercial agreement and are
looking forward to the passage of a Soviet emigration law.
   President Gorbachev, I am very gratified by what we've
accomplished over the last few days and determined to build on this
solid foundation. The agreements we record today and those yet to
come will advance the cause of peace, agreements in the best
interests of both our nations, and all nations.
   Not long ago, some believed that the weight of history condemned
our two great countries, our two great peoples to permanent
confrontation. Well, you and I must challenge history, make new
strides, build a relationship of enduring cooperation.
   We may not agree on everything and indeed we don't agree on
everything. But we believe in one great truth _ and the world has
waited long enough _ the Cold War must end. And so, today with
gratitude in my heart for all those on the Soviet side and the
United States side that worked so hard at all levels to bring these
agreements to fruition, I say let's renew our pledge and build a
more peaceful world. (Applause.)
   President Gorbachev: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
comrades, first of all I would like to thank President George Bush
for presenting so well the results of our work that we have been
doing over these days in Washington. So I have a problem _ what
shall I talk about? (Laughter.)

   Congressional leaders said Friday they cannot
approve Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's request for favored
trade status _ even if President Bush should do so _ until Moscow
relaxes pressure against freedom-minded Lithuania.
   Hours later, Bush and Gorbachev signed a trade agreement that
would be a step toward granting the Soviet Union most-favored-nation
status. But White House officials said the agreement would not be
sent to Congress for ratification until the Soviet Union enacts a
law protecting Jewish emigration _ the price Bush has set all along
for granting the broader tariff-lowering trade status.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said after the
signing ceremony: ``The granting of MFN status, in my mind, is in
Mr. Gorbachev's hands. He can achieve it with some rather modest
changes in his policy toward the Baltic states.''
   ``Anything we do needs to come with some strings attached,'' said
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., one of a dozen
members of Congress Gorbachev invited for a 90-minute meeting at the
Soviet Embassy.
   Gorbachev used the occasion, which was broadcast live on
television, to argue that freer trade between the superpowers would
be in the interests of both countries, and to chide Congress for
linking most-favored-nation trading status to resolution of the
Lithuanian situation _ a connection the Bush administration also has
made.
   But the leaders appeared to be unmoved, saying human rights
issues could not be separated from any concession on trade. ``We
have a political problem, too,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., afterward.
   As if to illustrate that, about 1,500 Lithuanian-Americans
rallied on the steps of the Capitol, waving green, yellow and red
Lithuanian flags and signs such as one that read: ``Gorbachev is a
Big Bully.''
   ``The United States will not give new trade benefits while the
Soviet noose continues to strangle Lithuania,'' said Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., who spoke to the rally but was not among those
invited to the Soviet Embassy.
   Gephardt and the others at the meeting with Gorbachev took a
gentler line, saying they recognized the Soviet president's efforts
to resolve Lithuania's status. ``We want it done peacefully,'' said
Gephardt. ``We recognize that everybody can't get everything they
want.''
   ``I don't think any of us believes that all of the issues have to
be finally and successfully concluded before we can do anything on a
trade negotiation,'' he said. ``But we do need to see some
substantial progress.''
   Any suggestion by Bush to advance MFN status would be seriously
considered on Capitol Hill, Gephardt added. ``I think it's
conceivable that in this year, we could deal with an MFN
suggestion.''
   Dole agreed that ``strong personal assurances'' from Gorbachev on
Lithuanian independence and free emigration might be enough for
Congress to make some gesture in return.
   ``Members want some fairly ironclad assurances that independence
will happen,'' Dole said, adding that he got the impression that
Gorbachev ``desperately wants some give on the trade side.''
   Democrats in the group also reacted favorably to a Gorbachev
remark questioning why President Bush had recommended
most-favored-nation status to China, which just a year ago crushed a
pro-democracy movement, but was withholding the same treatment from
the Soviet Union.
   ``That exposed the total inconsistency of President Bush's
position,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
who has been among Bush's harshest congressional critics on China
policy.
   The leaders indicated that another requirement for favored trade
status _ free emigration, particularly for Soviet Jews _ has largely
been met and is no longer a serious obstacle. But Mitchell and
Gephardt added a new one: a measure of success in establishing free
markets.
   ``The central requirement is reform of the economy,'' Mitchell
said. Favored trading status alone will not increase U.S. demand for
Soviet products, many of which are seen as inferior, he said, adding
that MFN status would be primarily of symbolic value to Gorbachev.
   For his part, the Soviet leader said he was not asking for
charity from the United States, only for normal credits which would
be repaid and for what he called a new trade relationship that would
benefit both countries.
   ``This is a genuine revolution,'' Gorbachev told the lawmakers as
they sat around a long table covered with green felt.
   ``We have to turn around our brains, as it were,'' he said.
``This is a most difficult turnaround to make. Here, too, we hope we
will find a mutual understanding and you will be able to find
certain ways of supporting us, so that we could interact.''

   So I think that I will do some thinking aloud in this context. I
would say that maybe this room has seen many important events and
many agreements signed, but I think that what is happening now and
what you have listed as the results of our work together represents
an event of momentous importance, not only for our two countries but
for the world.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt half a century ago spoke of a
world in which four essential freedoms will triumph: freedom of
speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear.
And this ideal has not yet been attained in the world, and it could
not be attained in the world of animosity and confrontation.
   And therefore, while liberating the world from fear we are making
steps toward a new world. And this is the important work of our two
nations, of our two peoples.
   What is very important, I think, is that we do not just declare
our commitment to moving toward a healthier international
environment, toward better international relations, toward a
nonviolent world.
   We are taking practical steps in that direction, and what you
have just listed, and what we'll be signing during this visit, I
think is a confirmation that both our declarations are right in that
they seek to justify the hopes of our peoples and that we're also
taking those practical steps.
   The important steps that we are taking today illustrate the
degree of agreement between our two countries, despite the fact that
_ and here I quite agree with you _ that there are things on which
we disagree, and there are differing views that we have on certain
questions. But that area of disagreement is being narrowed in the
course of our work together.
   What we will be signing, I think, is the best demonstration that
we are ready to participate at the level of our responsibility in
building a new civilization.
   There are still many difficult challenges awaiting us.

   Warner Bros. rededicates its sprawling
144-acre studio lot this weekend with a nostalgic extravaganza to
reassert its independence and claim as the box office king of the
movie business.
   Former President Reagan, star of more Warner movies than any
living actor, joins 1,000 of Hollywood's elite for Saturday night's
``Celebration of Tradition,'' produced by Steven Spielberg, David
Wolper and Jack Haley Jr.
   The event commemorates the full reacquisition and renaming of the
studio by Warner Bros. Brothers Albert, Harry, Jack and Sam Warner
bought the studio in 1929, but in 1972, Warner Bros. and Columbia
Pictures joined forces and the lot was renamed The Burbank Studios.
   The lot was reclaimed by Warner last November as a condition of
contractually releasing ``Batman'' producers Peter Guber and Jon
Peters to Sony, which had acquired Columbia and wanted the pair to
take its reins.
   Demand for tickets to the celebration was so intense, Warner
chief Robert A. Daly invited 2,500 past and present employees to the
studio for a Friday afternoon barbecue. The studio guards wore their
new uniforms as well.
   Studio limousines will fetch Hollywood luminaries Saturday night
and bring them to Burbank, where they will be treated to a dazzling
back lot tram tour recreating Hollywood's golden age.
   More than 175 dancers, 100 ``flappers,'' an 80-man drill team, a
100-piece marching band, a 200-member military precision team and
300 costumed extras will be featured. So will one elephant and one
Batmobile.
   Warner Bros., which now has the studio to itself, has been the
box office king for a year with such hits as ``Batman,'' ``Lethal
Weapon II'' and ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   A portion of Saturday's celebration will focus on a prominent
fixture on the studio lot, the water tower, which has been declared
a Burbank historical landmark. It hasn't been used since the
6.4-magnitude earthquake in 1971.
   The tower's newly-painted Warner Bros. logo will be unveiled
during the re-christening festivities. It will be lighted in a
ceremony using the same button Reagan used as president to
illuminate the refurbished Statue of Liberty in 1986.
   Although the former president will be there, Reagan won't be
pushing the button this time. Three Warner executives have that
honor.
   Partygoers will see Stage 16, the nation's tallest sound stage at
98 feet and 31,500-square feet. It was where Spencer Tracy meditated
in his boat while shooting ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' and where
Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis crossed the Bering Strait on ice floats
in ``The Great Race.''
   Stage 18 was also where the Ascot Gavotte scene in ``My Fair
Lady,'' horses and all, was filmed.
   Since the 1920s, the San Fernando Valley studio lot 10 miles
north of downtown Los Angeles has recreated cities, neighborhoods
and exotic locales for motion pictures and television.
   The expansive backlot features two Western towns, a wooded jungle
area, a Midwestern town, a European street, three New York City
blocks and a Far East tenement.
   Kirk Douglas, Randolph Scott and Henry Fonda made ``Shootout at
Medicine Bend,'' ``There was a Crooked Man'' and ``The Great Bank
Robbery'' in the Western towns and Errol Flynn, Alan Ladd and
Humphrey Bogart used the wooded area for films.
   The Gary Cooper, Ingrid Bergman movie ``Saratoga Trunk'' and the
tree-lined streets for Reagan's ``King's Row'' were shot in the
Midwestern town area. Several Doris Day movies were filmed there, as
were ``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Cool Hand Luke.''
   Rick's meeting with Ilsa at a Parisian cafe in ``Casablanca'' was
shot on the lot's European street.

   Celebrating the fruits of their summit
diplomacy, President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
signed a sheaf of agreements Friday, including a conditional trade
accord. The leaders also embraced a preliminary deal to cut
long-range nuclear arms.
   The trade accord was thought to hinge in part on Lithuania, but
Secretary of State James A. Baker said the only condition was a
loosening of Soviet emigration laws _ thought to be imminent.
   Congress must approve any agreement, however, and Baker
acknowledged that passage could be difficult unless Gorbachev starts
a new dialogue with independence-minded Lithuanian officials.
   The centerpiece arms agreement, banning chemical arms production,
was a foregone conclusion, however significant. But last-hour
negotiating was necessary to settle differences on a framework for
strategic arms cuts and a five-year grain deal.
   Gorbachev told the president and the leaders of his
administration that a strategic arms reduction treaty can be signed
before the end of this year, ``even though it is difficult.''
   The two leaders also agreed to strive for an elusive agreement on
reduction of troops, tanks and other conventional weapons in Europe.
Bush said the statement they signed on that negotiation commits both
sides ``to intensify the pace'' of the talks. Gorbachev said that
deal, too, should be completed this year.
   Referring to American reaction to Gorbachev's crackdown on
Lithuanian independence efforts, Gorbachev said, ``I am pleased to
note that the turbulent developments in recent months after Malta
have not led us astray from the goals we set together.''
   Baker the commercial trade agreement will not go to Congress
until the ``the (Soviet) emigration law is passed.'' Thus,
most-favored-nation status awaits Soviet approval for more liberal
travel abroad.
   Even though administration officials have said in the past that
the crisis in Lithuania had a bearing on the trade agreement, White
House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said: ``There has been no direct link
between Lithuania and trade.''
   From twin lecterns, the two presidents spoke of what they had
done and what they hope to do. ``I think what is happening now . . .
represents an event of momentous importance, not only for our two
countries but for the world,'' Gorbachev said.
   He praised Bush for his efforts to reach the accords and improve
U.S-Soviet relations. ``I am human in the sense that I'm
emotional,'' Gorbachev said. In the applause that followed, the two
leaders shook hands once, then did so again as aides brought on the
chairs to seat them for the signing.
   Until Friday noon, it was thought the missiles and grain were all
set for signatures, but spokesmen indicated otherwise.
   Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet foreign minister Eduard
Schevardnadze led negotiating teams that talked throughout the
afternoon to settle differences on the intricately linked agreements
_ especially trade, grain and strategic arms.
   Here are details of the agreements signed Friday evening:
   _A ``framework'' accord on the major elements of a Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks, or START, treaty to reduce each side's arsenal of
long-range nuclear weapons by about one-third over a 7-year period.
Negotiating teams were still trying to work out some details Friday
afternoon.
   The push for a missiles treaty is ``designed to enhance stability
and reduce the threat of war,'' Bush said.
   _An accord ending production of U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons
and eliminating all but 5,000 tons of their existing chemical
stockpiles. The deal is meant as a catalyst for a global agreement
to ban production and possession of these weapons.
   ``Let this landmark agreement quickly lead to a global ban,''
Bush said.
   _A protocol spelling out anti-cheating measures for existing
treaties that limit nuclear tests. The verification protocol will
permit both nations to ratify the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty and
the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty, which limit U.S. and
Soviet underground nuclear tests to 150 kilotons.
   _Expanding commercial air travel between the United States and
the Soviet Union by adding four American and six Soviet cities to
current airliner routes. It also will allow one more Soviet and six
more U.S. airlines to run the routes.
   _A new 5-year atomic energy agreement to provide closer
cooperation in nuclear reactor safety, fusion energy and basic
atomic science.
   _A maritime transportation pact to make it easier for U.S. and
Soviet commercial vessels to deliver goods to ports in one another's
country.
   _Opening reciprocal cultural and information centers in
Washington and Moscow.
   _The first government-to-government agreement to increase student
exchanges between the two countries.

<HEAD>Texas Governor Agrees to Sales Tax Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bill Clements said Friday he would
approve a sales tax increase as part of a $530 million deal with
legislative leaders on school financing reform, reversing his stance
of the past three months.
   At the same time, a judge held a hearing at which a
court-appointed master presented his own school finance blueprint,
the result of the state Supreme Court's ruling last year that the
school funding system was unconstitutional.
   Clements, House Speaker Gib Lewis and Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby said
they hoped their deal, which includes raising the sales tax from 6
percent to 6.25 percent, would keep the courts from revamping the
$13.5 billion-a-year school financing system.
   Texas is one of a dozen states where courts have overturned
school finance systems in recent years. The others are Kentucky, New
Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington, West
Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.
   Clements, Lewis and Hobby said they believed the Legislature
would approve the pact, which followed two days of private talks.
Clements said that on Monday he would call the Legislature into its
fourth consecutive special session on schools since Feb. 27 to begin
considering the agreement.
   The Republican governor, who since February had pledged to veto
any sales tax increase, said the compromise represented concessions
by him and the Democrat-controlled Legislature. He said he agreed to
a higher sales tax because he saw no other option.
   ``I can truthfully say that I don't know anybody who is happy
with this,'' Clements said. ``Maybe the judge will be. It has been a
very painful process, but we did it.''
   In the hearing Friday before state District Judge Scott McCown,
special master William Kilgarlin recommended shifting $540 million
in state education funds from wealthier school districts to poor
districts that make a strong effort to raise local property taxes.
   In its ruling last year, the Supreme Court ordered more money be
made available to poor districts.
   McCown voiced ``profound disappointment'' that lawmakers and
Clements so far had failed to enact a plan. If the latest
legislative deal passes, McCown still must give it his approval.
   In addition to the sales tax increase, the pact calls for budget
cuts, transfers of money from other programs and increases in taxes
on cigarettes and mixed drinks, and higher fees to raise a total of
more than $630 million, said Mike Toomey, the governor's chief of
staff.
   Of that, about $530 million is for school aid; about $100 million
would go to bail out financially strapped programs in the
departments of Health, Human Services, and Mental Health and Mental
Retardation, Toomey said.
   Raising the sales tax would raise about $298.9 million of the
total, according to Clements and his aides.
   About $193.5 million would come from raising the 26-cent per pack
cigarette tax by 15 cents. Another $43.2 million would be raised by
slightly increasing the levy on mixed drinks, raising fees to
replace lost drivers' licenses and debt service on state bonds
issued to help fund the superconducting supercollider project.
   The rest of the money, about $97.7 million, would be trimmed from
other parts of the state budget.
   ``You can see ... we have had a very difficult time raising the
funds we thought necessary for public education,'' Clements said.
   Clements vetoed a half-cent sales tax increase at the end of the
second special session, then during the third session vetoed the
actual school reform legislation because it also required a
half-cent sales tax boost.

   It is evident that to dismantle that monumental artifact of the
Cold War, the accumulated arsenals of mutual destruction, is not at
all a simple or even an entirely safe thing to do. The slightest
imbalance, undue haste or lack of equilibrium in this process may
dangerously destabilize the overall international situation.
   But I am sure that if we take a balanced and responsible
approach, if we take into account the concerns and positions of each
other even when we disagree, if we do all that, I am sure that we
will be able to move ahead more resolutely and more vigorously.
   Mr. President, you have just mentioned Malta. Mr. President, I am
pleased to note that the turbulent developments of recent months
after Malta have not led us astray from the goal we set together.
So, I believe that we have passed the first test.
   Mr. President, let me reaffirm here something that I've been
saying to you during our one-on-one talks. We have had many such
talks during this summit, and I welcome this style of negotiating.
   But let me reaffirm to both our peoples that the Soviet Union is
committed to the objective set at Malta, completing before the end
of this year the preparation of the START Treaty. I believe that
this goal is obtainable even though it is difficult.
   I also can confirm what you have said, that we have agreed that
during our talks that this year we will seek to sign a treaty at the
Vienna talks. And, of course, we believe that in that case, there
will be the CSCE European security summit meeting. I think we
already have good results and a good potential to work.

   The United States and the Soviet Union on
Friday reached agreement to ban heavy mobile nuclear missiles under
the treaty they are negotiating on long-range nuclear weapons.
   In addition, they also agreed on an extensive verification system
to ensure the reductions in a wide range of deadly weapons are
carried out.
   A joint statement, issued at the midpoint of President Bush's
summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, called
also for acceleration of negotiations in Geneva to complete the
START treaty by the end of the year.
   At the White House, Bush and Gorbachev approved the outlines of
the landmark treaty Friday for the first-ever cuts in long-range
nuclear missiles.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said that major issues had
been settled and completion of the treaty by the end of the year was
likely.
   Agreement on a ban on heavy mobile missiles marked an expansion
of the limitations already agreed to in eight years of U.S.-Soviet
talks.
   The verification procedure will cover 12 kinds of on-site
inspections, some of them on short notice.
   The agreement would prevent the Soviets from putting their heavy
ground-based SS-18 missiles on mobile launchers, such as trains or
trucks, a senior U.S. official said.
   The ban would have no direct impact on current U.S. nuclear
forces but would prevent the United States from basing any future
heavy intercontinental missile on mobile launchers.
   The official, who briefed reporters on details under rules that
he not be identified, said America's MX missile would not be
restricted in any way under the agreement because ``it is not
considered a heavy missile.''
   Among the existing ICBMs in both nations' arsenals only the SS-18
will be included in the banned category.
   ``The far-reaching reductions and other constraints contained in
the treaty will be accompanied by the most thorough and innovative
verification provisions ever negotiated,'' the U.S.-Soviet statement
said.
   Baker said both sides had made a commitment in a second round of
negotiations to make cuts in heavy missiles and those with multiple
warheads.
   On the other hand, Baker said at a news conference, ``serious
substantive differences remain'' on reducing troops, tanks and other
non-nuclear weapons from Europe that would not be resolved at the
summit.
   ``In short, I think we've made workmanlike progress'' across the
range of U.S.-Soviet relations, he said.
   Baker said the negotiations that were conducted since Sunday
expanded on the nuclear weapons categories to be restricted in the
treaty. In addition to adding the limits on mobile missiles, he said
the presidents had reached an agreement on ``the goals and
objectives'' of future negotiations to make even deeper cuts,
particularly in overall numbers of warheads.
   Still, Baker said, they failed to resolve disagreements over the
Soviet Backfire bomber, flight tests of heavy ground-based missiles,
and safeguards against the transfer of nuclear weaponry to third
countries.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hoisted a
glass of golden champagne in toast to dinner guest George Bush
Friday night shortly after the pair announced a host of agreements,
including the broad outline of a pact to slash stockpiles of
long-range nuclear missiles.
   ``Now that we have recorded the progress we have made,'' said
Gorbachev in an ornate Soviet Embassy dining hall, ``I would like to
express the hope the ship of Soviet-American relations will continue
to sail its course.''
   Returning the compliment, President Bush extolled the progress of
the Washington summit. But he also said that ``true peace takes more
than just the laying down of arms, it also takes the reaching out of
hands.''
   So tight was security for the embassy dinner that large frames of
bullet-proof glass were positioned in front of windows facing the
busy street outside.
   For Bush and his wife, Barbara, and a host of top-ranking U.S.
government officials, Gorbachev and his wife Raisa broke out their
country's best wines to compliment a menu of roast duck, suckling
pig and apple puff pastry.
   The Tsinandali Georgian white dry 1987 and Mookoozani Georgian
red dry 1987, renowned in the Soviet union, were joined on the menu
by the Soviets' golden champagne Zolotoye.
   The Soviet Embassy dinner came a day after the Bushes entertained
the Gorbachevs at a White House state dinner, and it also featured
smoked meat, and consomme with dumplings and mushroom cream.
   The main course was baked sevruga-fish and roast suckling pig,
followed by desert of strawberry parfait, fruit, and apple puff
pastry.
   The embassy released the menu Friday evening after tightly
holding details in secrecy. The practice was even more restrictive
than the White House procedure of holding details of its state
dinner until just a few hours before the guests begin arriving.
   ``It's just a tradition. Our leaders don't like to put out an
official ord on the menu,'' said Vladimir Ustimenko, spokesman for
the Soviet delegation at the summit press center.
   A few details were available from Soviet press contacts _ the
dinner guests would be entertained after coffee by opera singer
Zurab Sotkilava, and pianist Mikhail Pletnev.
   The 80 guests would be seated in the embassy's Gold Room at seven
round tables seating 10 each with a head table for top dignitaries.
Before dinner, guests would gather in the Fireplace Room for drinks.
   Dress, in contrast to the black tie formal at the White House
state dinner for the Gorbachevs on Thursday, was simple _ black
business suits for men, and ``normal'' length dresses for women.
That meant no mini-skirts, a Soviet spokesman said.
   After dessert and before coffee, the Soviet and U.S. presidents
were to deliver their formal toasts, which the Soviets, who have a
tendency to make lengthy remarks, referred to as speeches.
   When Gorbachev visited in 1987, guests at the embassy dinner
dined on Russian caviar on ice, crab meat glace, cold suckling pig,
baked ``Bester'' fish a la Muscovite, shashlyk of lamb and raspberry
parfait.
   A questioned still unanswered as the dinner hour arrived was: who
were the lucky 40 Americans who would join Gorbachev and his wife
and some 40 Soviet dinner invitees?
   Calls to the embassy for the list got repeated busy signals or
recordings. A Communist Party official who briefed reporters at the
press center shrugged his shoulders sympathetically but replied ``I
don't have a list.''
   But the White House managed to come up with a fairly complete
list of the Americans invited with spouses:
   Among the invitees was Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, who turned down an invitation to the Soviet Embassy dinner
during Gorbachev's 1987 visit when Dole was running for the GOP
presidential nomination. He went instead to meet with members of the
state contractors association in Manchester, N.H.
   Also on the list was industrialist Armand Hammer, a favorite in
Moscow for his many years of business contacts with the Soviets;
Katharine Graham, chairman of the board of The Washington Post Co.;
Duayne Andreas, the Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. chairman, and Pepsico
Inc. chairman Donald Kendall, both of whom also were invited to
Wednesday's White House dinner.
   Others were Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell of Maine,
House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois and businessman
Thomas Minor.
   In addition, Vice President Dan Quayle and his wife Marilyn
planned to attend, as did Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft; White House chief of
staff John Sununu; Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady; Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Ambassador Jack
Matlock, and State Department protocol chief Joseph Reed.

   Rallying under their national colors,
Baltic-Americans cheered calls on Friday for President Bush to deny
favored trade status to the Soviet Union and bestow it instead on
Lithuania.
   ``We call on our government to recognize the new government in
Vilnius and extend most-favored-nation status not to the U.S.S.R.
but to the government of Lithuania,'' said AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland.
   Some 1,500 people, many wearing national dress as they stood on
the Capitol steps and lawn, applauded and chanted, ``thank you,
thank you.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was a mile down
Pennsylvania Avenue, conferring with Bush at the White House, but he
was much on the minds of the Lithuanian-Americans,
Estonian-Americans and Latvian-Americans who shouted for
independence for their homelands.
   Later in the day, Bush and Gorbachev signed an agreement that
would bring about normal economic relations between the two
countries. U.S. officials said a provision granting lower tariffs on
Soviet products will not go into effect until the Soviet legislature
passes a law providing free emigration.
   But the treaty was signed without reference to Gorbachev's
handling of the independence movement in Lithuania. In recent weeks,
the administration had suggested it might refuse to sign a trade
agreement unless Gorbachev eased up on its economic blockade of the
Baltic republic.
   Lithuanian-Americans protesting Friday evening outside the Soviet
Embassy said they were disappointed in Bush's decision.
   ``I think he should take a stronger stance. He should listen to
the people of the United States,'' said Aras Tijunelis of Chicago.
``No concessions should be made until he sees the blockade is being
lifted and oppression of Lithuania is ending.''
   Toward the end of the earlier gathering, someone began burning a
Soviet flag, but no arrests were made because officers were unable
to identify anyone responsible, said U.S. Capitol Police spokesman
Off. Daniel Nichols. It is illegal to have an open flame on Capitol
grounds, Nichols said.
   Crowds were sparse at Lafayette Park and the Ellipse, parks just
north and south of the White House where rallies had been scheduled.
No arrests or violent incidents were reported.
   By early afternoon there were about 50 demonstrators in Lafayette
Park seeking reunification of Korea, democracy for Vietnam, and an
end to prison camps in the Soviet Union.
   ``This doesn't touch Americans at all,'' Michail Makarenko, who
said he had been a Soviet political prisoner, said of the
Bush-Gorbachev talks. ``It's just another film Bush will be able to
use in the next elections.''
   Gorbachev was portrayed on placards at the Capitol rally as a boa
constrictor, strangling Lithuanian independence, as a dispatcher of
tanks, as a fallen angel with a gun at Lithuania's head.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, return what was stolen,'' a poster read,
referring to the forced incorporation of the Baltic states into the
Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``Bush makes no deals with terrorists _ unless they're Russian,''
read another.
   Over the heads of the speakers and the crowd rippled hundreds of
flags: the gold, green and red tricolor of Lithuania, the black,
white and blue of Estonia, the red, white and red stripes of Latvia.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, understand that it's not good enough for you to
talk about freedom and democracy when you are depriving the people
of Lithuania of food and energy and medical supplies,'' said Sen.
Alfonse, D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   Addressing Gorbachev in absentia, D'Amato said: ``You may have
spread Gorbymania around the world but you have not fooled the
American people and there will be no MFN until Lithuania is free.''
   The Senate voted 73-24 last month to oppose trade concessions for
the Kremlin until the Soviet economic blockade is lifted and
negotiations begin on Lithuanian independence.

   The superpowers are billing their nearly
completed arms treaty as a step toward ending the arms race, but
private experts said Friday its value may be mainly symbolic.
   The deal as outlined by President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev carries a potent political punch: It's the
first treaty to reduce the number of long-range nuclear arms.
   But by the time the pact is fully implemented, probably in 1998,
analysts say both the United States and the Soviet Union may be
nearly asth nuclear arms as they are today, unless
additional treaties are negotiated be well stocked wifore then.
   Gorbachev and Bush failed in a second day of summitry Friday to
settle at least three points of dispute in the proposed treaty, but
they pledged to conclude the deal by the end of the year. They also
agreed to begin negotiating a follow-up treaty on strategic arms
once the pending deal is finished.
   The military significance of the emerging agreement is diluted by
decisions to ``discount,'' or exclude, some weapons from the
counting rules, and to leavthe Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private research group, described the treaty as making a
virtue of necessity: scrapping mostly obsolete weapons while
permitting both sides to continue building new ones.
   ``Everything is allowed, just at slightly reduced numbers,'' he
said.
   Among the U.S. weapons that are expected to be scrapped under the
START treaty, if completed in its current form and ratified by both
countries' legislatures, are Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic
missiles deployed between 1966 and 1969, and B-52G long-range
bombers built from 1958 to 1960, Norris said.
   However, it's not yet clear exactly what combination of weapons
would be retired in order to remain within START's overall limit on
ballistic missile warheads of 4,900.
   The Soviets would be expected to retire several types of
intercontinental ballistic missiles, including 154 of their SS-18s,
which are the centerpiece of their strategic nuclear force. These
missiles were deployed between 1975 and 1980.
   The treaty is expected to allow at least some modernization of
the remaining SS-18s. This provision, however, would be the only one
in the treaty to put limits on individual weapons. As a result, both
sides will be allowed virtually unlimited freedom to develop and
deploy newer, more accurate weapons later this decade.
   Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a critic of the Bush administration's
negotiating efforts on START, said signing the deal without banning
modernization of the SS-18 ``makes a mockery'' of the
administration's assertions about the value of the treaty.

   Japan has protested Soviet detention of 18 Japanese
fishermen held in one of a series of incidents involving illegal
salmon fishing in the North Pacific, the Foreign Ministry said
Friday.
   The protest appeared to be a return salvo in a fishing dispute
involving Japan, the Soviet Union as well as North Korea.
   Spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev said Thursday in Moscow that the
Soviet Foreign Ministry had protested to Japan over ``crude
violations'' of treaties that regulate harvest of the rich salmon
fisheries off Soviet Asia.
   Shigeo Takenaka, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry, told
reporters Friday that Japan did not dispute the Soviets' right to
stop and seize vessels involved in illegal fishing. But he said the
Soviets overstepped their powers by confiscating six Japanese
fishing boats and not returning all the crew.
   Under the Japanese-Soviet fishing agreement, Takenaka said,
``jurisdiction belongs to the Japan side, they have to hand over the
vessels and fishermen to the Japan side.''
   Takenaka said the Soviets seized six Japanese boats with 52
crewmen in the May 9-13 period and took them to the Soviet island of
Sakhalin, north of Japan. A trial was held, each vessel was fined
$530,000 to $600,000 and the vessels were confiscated, he said.
   Only 34 crew members returned to Japan Friday, while 18 men
remained in detention, he said.
   ``This is, from our standpoint, a violation of the Japan-Soviet
fishing cooperation agreement,'' Takenaka said. He said Japan was
requesting immediate return of the fishermen and vessels.
   Asked if Japan lodged a protest, Takenaka replied, ``Yes, we are
requesting, and a protest is the same thing.''
   He said the Soviets also were studying a Japanese request for
early release of 169 Japanese crew found on 12 fishing boats flying
the North Korean flag. The Soviets seized those boats about two
weeks ago, starting an incident that raised eyebrows in Japan over
the unusual partnership between Japanese and North Korean fishing
operators.
   Japan and Communist North Korea have no diplomatic relations. On
the fishing level, however, the lure of salmon appears to have drawn
Japanese fishing companies into leasing boats and crews to North
Korea, with part of the catch making its way into Japanese markets.
   Soviet diplomatic sources in Tokyo say Moscow has also protested
to North Korea, which is a Soviet ally but has no fishing agreement
with the Soviet Union. Japan has an agreement to take 11,000 tons of
salmon originating in Soviet rivers.
   The sources, who demanded anonysmity, said the Japanese fishermen
detained on North Korea-flag vessels would probably be released next
week after a trial.
   Japanese authorities are investigating the deal involving
Japanese boats under North Korean flags. The fisheries agency said
it did not give the required permission for such transfers.

   Two masked gunmen killed one British
soldier and wounded two at the Lichfield railway station, and hours
later a British army major was shot dead on Saturday in West
Germany, the Ministry of Defense said.
   It said Maj. Michael John Dillon-Lee of the Royal Artillery was
shot in Dortmund as he drove with his wife from the military base
there to their home in the West German city's Gartendstadt area.
   Dortmund police said one police officer was injured after shots
were fired at police cars chasing the gunmen in a silver metallic
painted car. The gunmen escaped after the occupants fired at police,
hitting one officer in the foot, police said.
   Dillon-Lee was shot several times in the head after he stopped
his car in front of his house, said the defense spokesman, speaking
anonymously in keeping with British practice. He died instantly, but
his wife was not injured, the spokesman said.
   In Lichfield, authorities said the three soldiers were attacked
while waiting on a platform for a train Friday, and witnesses said
the gunfire sent commuters fleeing.
   The Irish Republican Army is waging an offensive against British
forces on mainland Britain and on the Continent as part of its
campaign to drive the British out of the province of Northern
Ireland. Police said, however, that they were keeping an open mind
about who carried out the Lichfield attack.
   The soldiers, recruits undergoing training at Lichfield army
base, had purchased tickets and were waiting for their train to
nearby Birmingham for weekend leave, said Malcolm Bevington,
detective chief superintendent of Staffordshire Police.
   He said two masked men appeared on the platform, pulled out
handguns and shot the soldiers, then jumped onto the tracks, ran
across the line and through a builder's yard opposite the station.
   Lichfield is 100 miles northwest of London. All three victims
were recruits to the Prince of Wales Division.
   The Ministry of Defense identified the slain soldier as
19-year-old Pvt. William Robert Davies of Pontarddulais, south Wales.
   It identified the wounded soldiers as Robert Parkin, 20, and Neil
Evans, 19.
   Chief Inspector Tony Johnson of Staffordshire Police said Parkin
and Evans spoke to police at the hospital, adding, ``Both men are
sitting up in bed. They are comfortable and as well as can be
expected.''
   A British rail employee who witnessed the shooting, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said, ``I thought they were just messing
about, but suddenly there were six loud bangs. Two collapsed to the
ground and the third slumped onto a bench.''
   He said he jumped across the tracks to try to help the soldiers.
   ``I and a station employee tried to staunch the flow of blood
from the chest of one of the soldiers.
   ``I could not believe what had happened. The soldiers were in
civilian clothes, but it was obvious by their short hairstyle and
the way they carried themselves that they were military personnel.
   ``My feelings are that these gunmen are just cowards and I do not
suppose they would dream about tackling our lads if they had been
armed. It is just such a shame, the soldiers seemed so young.''
   Police, aided by dogs and a helicopter, searched the area.
   Scotland Yard said it sent an anti-terrorist squad.
   Taxi driver Peter Irmer said: ``There is a regular movement of
troops to the station on a Friday afternoon and evening from
Whittington Barracks.
   ``The majority of soldiers go home on a Friday and almost all of
them start their weekends leave from Lichfield City Station.''
   An army spokesman said the three were in the 12th week of a
21-week training schedule.

   A young man was sentenced Friday to the
maximum 25 years to life in prison for the murder of a 13-year-old
neighbor, a crime that tore two families and a town apart.
   ``No dictionary contains sufficient words to describe the
brutality of your acts,'' Nassau County Court Judge Marvin Goodman
said in sentencing Robert Golub, 22.
   Goodman added that the violence Kelly Ann Tinyes suffered last
year was ``the most atrocious'' he'd seen in his 17 years as a
judge. The girl was beaten, strangled, slashed and sexually
mutilated.
   Golub, who did not testify at his trial, broke his silence with a
20-minute statement before he was sentenced.
   ``I did not kill Kelly Ann Tinyes,'' he said, speaking in a soft,
quavering voice. ``Maybe the person is here today with us, but as
sure as there is a God, it is not me.''
   His parents, John and Elizabeth, sat on the edge of their chairs
inside the packed courtroom, straining to hear their son's words.
   Golub was convicted in April of murdering Kelly Ann, wrapping her
body in a sleeping bag and stuffing it into a closet in the basement
of his family's home in the Long Island town of Valley Stream.
   Golub and his family have claimed a stranger broke into their
home and committed the murder while Robert, his younger brother John
J. Golub and two of John's friends were at home. The brother and his
friends were not implicated.
   In asking for the maximum sentence, Nassau County Assistant
District Attorney Daniel Cotter called Golub a psychopath and a
sociopath who has ``no remorse, no concern, no conscience.''
   The judge said he received more than 4,000 letters on Golub's
sentencing, nearly all urging him to give Golub the maximum for
second-degree murder.
   Kelly Ann's nude body was found the day after she was reported
missing by her family on March 3, 1989.
   The Tinyeses and Golubs have lived three doors apart for 25 years.
   Outside the Tinyes home, decorated with pink and white balloons
sent by a neighbor, Richard Tinyes said the family was pleased.
   As for Golub's statement, Tinyes said, ``He's a liar and he
should rot in hell.''
   A few doors away, John Golub stood outside waiting for the
inevitable pack of reporters and television cameras.
   ``If my son was guilty I wouldn't think it was a tough sentence,
but we say he is innocent, so of course it's tough for us to take,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas blew up more than 20
utility poles and high-tension wire towers Friday, leaving a third
of El Salvador without electricity on the first anniversary of
Alfredo Cristiani's presidency.
   In a speech to the legislature on his first year in office,
Cristiani declared the next 12 months ``the year of peace'' and
called on al sectors to work for an end to this Central American
country's 10-year-old civil war.
   The sabotage affected eight of the country's 14 provinces,
authorities of the state-owned power company CEL reported. The
provincial capitals of San Miguel, Usulutan and Zacatecoluca were
without power, as was much of San Salvador, the capital.
   Cristiani, a rightist, cited as his main achievement the
resumption of peace talks with insurgents of the leftist Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front. The U.N.-sponsored talks began last
month in Venezuela and are considered the most promising since the
insurrection began.
   More than 71,000 people have been killed in the civil war, most
of them civilians.

   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev signed a new trade pact Friday that would lead to
normalized economic relations between the two countries for the
first time in nearly a half century.
   But the Bush administration emphasized that the provision most
prized by Gorbachev, granting lower tariffs on Soviet products sold
in the United States, will not go into effect until the Soviet
legislature passes a law providing free emigration.
   At a White House signing ceremony, Bush said that he and
Gorbachev were ``looking forward to the passage of a Soviet
emigration law.''
   At a briefing afterward, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said the agreement would not be sent to Congress for ratification
until the emigration law is passed.
   The emigration law has gone through a first reading in the Soviet
legislature but has yet to be brought up for final passage.
   The pact was signed without reference to Gorbachev's handling of
the independence movement in Lithuania. In recent weeks, the
administration had raised the possibility that it would refuse to
sign a trade agreement unless Gorbachev eased up on its economic
blockade of the Baltic republic.
   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk told reporters
that ``there has been no direct link between Lithuania and trade.''
   However, members of Congress from both parties have insisted that
there be just such a link.
   Said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, ``The
granting of MFN status, in my mind, is in Mr. Gorbachev's hands. He
can achieve it with some rather modest changes in his policy toward
the Baltic states.''
   ``The United States will not give new trade benefits while the
Soviet noose continues to strangle Lithuania,'' said Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y. He talked to reporters before Bush and Gorbachev
signed the agreement.
   Lithuanian-American demonstrators massed outside the Soviet
Embassy in Washington were clearly disappointed with Bush's decision.
   ``I think he's letting democracy and independence down,'' said
Arunas Martinonis of Boston. ``It really upsets me.''
   ``Bush should be stronger about Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia,''
said Helen Zimavicus Carter, who drove 15 hours from her Chicago
home to join the protest. ``We're really shocked he doesn't stand up
for their rights.''
   In addition to the trade pact, the two leaders reached agreement
on a five-year grain purchase agreement. U.S. officials had said
that the Soviets were threatening to hold up signing this pact
unless they got a trade agreement.
   Intense debate was taking place on the grain and trade proposals
throughout much of the day as the Soviets threatened to block the
grain agreement _ advantageous to U.S. farmers _ if they didn't get
the trade pact they sought, administration officials said.
   However, larger issues in U.S.-Soviet relations appeared to play
more of a role in Bush's decision to give Gorbachev the trade pact
than any last-minute haggling over the grain agreement, the
officials suggested, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Bush administration officials in the days leading up to the
summit had been vague _ presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater at
one point said the vagueness was intentional _ on whether the trade
agreement would be signed.
   The trade agreement _ sorely wanted by Gorbachev _ was always
Bush's trump card, officials suggested.
   ``It was quite obvious that Gorbachev was seeking something on
the economic front,'' said one official. ``It's obviously something
that he wanted to take home.''
   To emphasize the importance he placed on a trade pact, Gorbachev
took his lobbying campaign directly to members of Congress earlier
Friday. He told them that approval of a trade deal would be
``especially politically'' useful for him back home.
   American and Soviet negotiators reached agreement several weeks
ago on the details for both a trade pact and a grain agreement in
anticipation that both would be signed at the Washington summit.
However, the outcome of both deals was in doubt up until the signing
ceremony Friday.
   The pact would be a step toward granting the Soviet Union
most-favored-nation trade status, qualifying it for the lowest
tariffs granted to any country.
   Currently, Soviet products sold in the United States bear duties
that are as much as 10 times higher than imports from other
countries. By one estimate, the price of Soviet vodka could drop by
$1.25 per bottle.
   Leading American business groups including the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers have also
been lobbying for approval of the agreement, warning that without
the deal American companies will be at a disadvantage in trying to
gain access to the vast Soviet market.
   The agreement would provide better copyright protection for
American companies and cut down on the time U.S. companies must wait
for approval to begin commercial operations in the Soviet Union.
   It would also clear the way for approval of government-subsidized
loans and for loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank and the
Overseas Private Investment Corp.
   Analysts said this provision was significant because it would
expand the number of U.S. companies interested in setting up joint
ventures in the Soviet Union, a key goal of Gorbachev's economic
reforms.
   Gorbachev said his quest for the trade agreement did not
represent a plea for special favors.
   The grain accord would increase the minimum amount of U.S. wheat,
feed grains, soybeans and other commodities that the Soviets would
purchase from the current 9 million tons annually to 10 million tons.
   The Soviet Union is the largest foreign market for American grain
products and new grain pact was viewed as a top objective for U.S.
farm groups.

<HEAD>New Florida Law Bans Clothing as Evidence in Rape Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense attorneys in rape cases can no
longer use the alleged victim's clothing as evidence to justify the
attack, under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Bob Martinez.
   ``There is no excuse for rape under any circumstances, and this
law will make it clear that the victim of sexual battery should not
be persecuted as the criminal is prosecuted,'' the Republican
governor said. ``This new law is a major victory for the rights of
crime victims.''
   The bill's sponsor, Democratic Rep. Elaine Gordon Miami, said the
measure stemmed from the acquittal of a rape suspect last October in
Fort Lauderdale. Jurors commented that the woman may have tempted
the assailant by wearing skimpy clothing.
   The woman's attorney called the new law ``overkill,'' and
predicted it will be challenged.
   The alleged victim testified that Steven Lord, 26, abducted her
at knifepoint from a Fort Lauderdale restaurant parking lot in
November 1988 and raped her repeatedly during a trip north on
Interstate 95. She said she escaped five hours later and 120 miles
north of where she'd been abducted.
   Defense attorney Tim Day told jurors the 22-year-old woman agreed
to have sex with Lord in exchange for $100 and cocaine, but later
changed her mind.
   Several jurors said they decided on an innocent verdict partly
because the woman was wearing a lace miniskirt and no underwear.
   The acquittal sparked outrage and protests from many womens'
groups.
   The woman's attorney, Alexander Siegel, said he believes enough
rules already exist on what evidence is acceptable and that judges
and attorneys should handle each case individually.
   ``In my opinion the new law is unconstitutional and
unnecessary,'' said Siegel. ``Judges are quite capable of deciding
what can be introduced and attorneys can be more aggressive about
trying to keep things out.''
   Siegel believes the law will be challenged in the first rape case
in which the alleged victim's clothing could be a factor.
   In December, Lord pleaded guilty in a Georgia court to raping and
kidnapping a Decatur, Ga., woman. Lord was sentenced to life in
prison for the rape and a concurrent 20-year sentence for kidnapping.

   Rwanda Radio reported Friday that college

that one student was killed in a clash between rioters and guards at
a dance hall in central Rwanda.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, gave no reason for the

ordered local leaders and university authorities to right the

   The radio said students damaged the regional administrator's

   Butare, with a population of 12,000, is the second largest town
in the tiny, landlocked nation. Kigali, the capital, is first.

   When the U.S.-Soviet summit conference concludes
Sunday in Washington, the television network news anchors will head
for San Francisco to cover the finale of Mikhail Gorbachev's visit
to the United States.
   Exactly what that coverage will be is anybody's guess, network
news producers said Friday afternoon, because Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's plans for visiting Minneapolis and San Francisco still
were unsettled.
   ``We're going to be in a `significant stand-by mode,''' said Jeff
Gralnick, executive producer of ABC's summit coverage.
   NBC, CBS and CNN will broadcast Gorbachev's speech at Stanford
University, scheduled for 3 p.m. Monday, during his daylong tour of
the San Francisco Bay area, but none of the networks plan live
coverage of the Minnesota visit.
   ``We'll stay very flexible, with the capacity to cover as much or
as little as we need,'' said John Towriss, a CNN producer in
Minneapolis. He said CNN expects the day's big news will be the
summit's aftermath in Washington.
   Nevertheless, five local stations have pooled their resources to
cover what will be one of the year's biggest stories in Minneapolis
and St. Paul.
   KARE, KMSP, KSTP, KTCA and WCCO will be sharing camera crews,
satellite newsgathering vehicles and editing and production
resources, said Steve Blum, a spokesman for Conus Communications,
the satellite TV news service.
   Pool ``feeds'' will be transmitted via Conus uplinks to
satellite, live and unedited, to Conus' 140 subscribing TV stations
worldwide.
   ``Wherever possible, we're using satellite newsgathering
equipment,'' Blum said. That allows for a rapid deployment of
equipment and staff at all the potential stops on Gorbachev's
intinerary.
   The satellite gear also will let the pool station a camera in
Gorbachev's motorcade. A portable microwave transmitter beams the
signal to a nearby helicopter, which in turn relays the signal to
the satellite uplink.
   U.S. and Soviet security officials nixed the idea of a helicopter
hovering over the motorcade, but will allow it to fly three miles
away from the procession. ``That's about as far as we can work and
about as close as they're willing to let us get,'' Blum said.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, fly to the Bay area Sunday
evening. They will stay with the Soviet consul-general's residence
in San Francisco.
   On Monday morning, former President Ronald Reagan and his wife,
Nancy, will join the Gorbachevs for ``coffee and conversation.''
   The Soviet couple is scheduled to leave San Francisco at 9:30
p.m., or 6:30 p.m. PDT, on Monday.

   The spokesman at Clark Air Base
announced Friday that U.S. troops, Defense Department civilians and
military dependents could not leave the base except on essential
business.
   U.S. officials cited an undisclosed security threat in the area,
where communist rebels killed two U.S. airmen last month.
   ``Local, current conditions dictate we take action right now,''
said the spokesman, Lt. Col. Ron Rand, without elaboration in an
announcement broadcast by the U.S. military's television station.
   He said 20,300 people are affected.
   The chief of the Philippine Constabulary, Maj. Gen. Cesar
Nazareno, said Friday he ordered increased security patrols around
U.S. bases because of the communist threat.
   U.S. officials one week ago had relaxed restrictions imposed
after rebels killed Airmen John Raven and James Green on May 13, one
day before U.S. and Philippine officials began talks on the future
of U.S. bases here.
   Clark, one of the largest American installations abroad, lies 50
miles north of Manila in a stronghold of the Communist New People's
Army.
   The Communist guerrillas have fought for 21 years to establish a
Marxist state and have pledged to continue attacking Americans until
all U.S. troops leave the Philippines.
   Eight Americans have died in politically motivated violence in
the Philippines since April 1989.
   Stars and Stripes, the unofficial newspaper of the U.S. military,
meanwhile reported Friday that dependents no longer will be allowed
to accompany troops to the Philippines unless housing for them
exists on the bases.
   It said about half the personnel at Clark live off post and the
waiting list for base housing ranges from six months to nearly three
years, depending on rank.

   Barbara Bush and Raisa Gorbachev gave the
graduating women of Wellesley College some first-lady advice Friday
and then rejoiced in their newfound friendship.
   ``I simply feel very at home and comfortable with Mrs. Gorbachev
and I have enormous respect for her,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters as
the pair toured Boston after sharing the commencement platform.
   Said Mrs. Gorbachev: ``I particularly rejoice at the fact that
our conversations are extremely open, sincere and friendly. And
despite the fact that we might have differences, that does not
change the tone.''
   These were words that had not publicly passed between Mrs.
Gorbachev and Nancy Reagan, Mrs. Bush's predecessor.
   At Wellesley's graduation ceremonies, Mrs. Bush disarmed critics
who had argued that she was not a suitable role model for women in
the '90s.
   ``I never dreamed it would be this much fun,'' the American first
lady said.
   The crowd cheered, ``Barbara, Barbara, Barbara'' as Mrs. Bush
spoke unabashedly about her homemaker's life, while urging the
graduates to pursue professional careers if that was their goal.
   ``They were nice,'' Mrs. Bush said of the students Friday night.
   The first lady credited Mrs. Gorbachev with the reception the two
got, calling her ``my secret weapon.''
   ``She's wonderful,'' Mrs. Bush said as she returned to the White
House following a dinner at the Soviet Embassy.
   Asked how she and Mrs. Gorbachev hit it off, Mrs. Bush replied
``very well.''
   Sounding some of the themes that Mrs. Bush hit, Mrs. Gorbachev _
a professional women herself _ spoke of ``the values that bring us
together,'' including love of country and children.
   Mrs. Bush, who dropped out of college to marry George Bush as
World War II raged a continent away, wore a black academic robe with
a purple cowl. Mrs. Gorbachev, a philosophy Ph.D and former
university lecturer, wore a plaid gray suit and pink blouse.
   More conspicuous were the graduates who wore purple armbands,
signaling their lingering belief that Mrs. Bush's life has
epitomized the victory of fealty to family over feminist emergence.
   Mrs. Bush got hearty applause when she said at one point:
Somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day
follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the
president's spouse. I wish him well!''
   But while urging the graduates to pursue professional careers, if
they so choose, Mrs. Bush warned, ``At the end of your life, you
will never regret not having passed one more test, winning one more
verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not
spent with a husband, a child, a friend, or a parent.''
   Speaking second, Mrs. Gorbachev's gave a serious, but upbeat,
talk on the virtues of Soviet perestroika and the economic reforms
undertaken by her husband, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``This vast and difficult task is a tough challenge, but we are
confident that perestroika will succeed,'' she said. ``... Its goal
is to make ideals and values a reality.''
   Then, sounding some of the themes that Mrs. Bush hit, she spoke
of ``the values that bring us together,'' including love of country
and children.
   ``If people in the world today are more confident of a peaceful
future, we have to give a good deal of credit for that to women,''
she said.
   Wellesleys' 112th commencement would have been momentous even
without the student petition questioning whether Mrs. Bush was a
suitable role model for the graduates of this elite Massachusetts
college for women.
   It was the first time the two first ladies ever shared a public
platform, and Wellesley President Nannerl O. Keohane called it
``another step in the glasnost that brings a new spirit of
cooperation between our two countries.''
   The two first ladies later toured Boston, twice emerging from
their limousine to wade into tumultuous crowds of well-wishers in
Wellesley Square and outside Wellesley Middle School. They joined
arms and held their hands aloft to the delight of the crowd.
   After driving through Cambridge and by the Charles River past
Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, they headed
for Boston Public Garden, where children from Mather School, the
oldest public elementary school in the United States, gave them
copies of a classic children's book, ``Make Way for Ducklings.''
   On the Wellesley campus, some graduating seniors had come up with
a fresh protest Friday for Mrs. Bush _ a letter urging her to ``take
a definitive and vocal stand'' on abortion rights and other social
issues affecting women.
   The letter said that in honoring Mrs. Bush, ``We celebrate all
the unknown women who have dedicated their lives to serving
others.'' The armbands were purple because that was the senior class
color this year.
   The commencement was held inside a cavernous white tent that held
5,500 people. During the playing of the Soviet national anthem,
several adults held a banner in the main aisle that read ``Free the
Baltic States.''
   Graduate Suki Hudson of Warwick, R.I., said of the seniors'
protest: ``These things are important to women. With her position, I
think if she can take a stand, women's situation would improve a
great deal . That's all we ask from her.''

   A package addressed to a psychiatrist
exploded in his office Friday, critically wounding him.
   Other tenants in his building said they rushed into the office of
Dr. Paul Peckar when they heard the explosion around noon and
extinguished a fire there.
   The blast shattered the window of Peckar's third-floor office and
forced the evacuation of the building for several hours.
   A patient waiting in an outer office was taken to Mount Vernon
Hospital after being hit with shrapnel, officials said. Valerie
Ahmed, 52, was treated after she suffered burns on the legs and
face, according to fire officials. The hospital declined to release
information on her condition.
   Peckar, 50, was flown to the Washington Hospital Center in the
District of Columbia, about 10 miles away, by helicopter. He
underwent surgery of a nature that officials declined to specify,
and his condition was listed as critical.
   Mark Appleton, 38, a podiatrist who worked in another office in
the building, was treated for smoke inhalation at Mount Vernon
Hospital and released. He said when the bomb exploed he ran to a
bathroom, filled a garbage can with water and poured it over Peckar.
   A doctor who was in the building at the time and examined Peckar
said he was badly burned on his hands and face, said Fairfax County
officials who reported burns on about 30 percent of Peckar's body.
   Post Office spokesman Douglas Turner said officials will try to
determine if one of Peckar's patients sent him the package.
   Another mail bomb injured Maryland Circuit Court Judge John P.
Corderman of Hagerstown on Dec. 22.

   Mikhail Gorbachev is pouring on the charm,
disarming critics and admirers alike with his candor and telling
average Americans on the street he feels ``really at home'' with
them despite U.S.-Soviet differences.
   ``All people,'' he said in one sidewalk exchange Thursday, ``want
a better tomorrow. And the rest is not too important.''
   Whether teasing Henry Kissinger at an embassy lunch, parrying
with reporters at the White House, or spontaneously departing his
motorcade to shake hands with tourists and federal workers,
Gorbachev went about town surprising and delighting his audiences.
   ``We have a good mutual understanding with the president, even if
sometimes we draw different conclusions,'' he told reporters who had
staked out the White House driveway. ``We both have a willingness to
listen, and so our dialogue is very substantive.''

   A naive young man is transformed into a
corrupt, calculating bureaucrat in a recent Soviet film called ``The
Villain.'' Ivan Minas-Bekov jokes that he knows him.
   ``I understand everything about this mafia, black-market
person,'' says Minas-Bekov, a violinist who emigrated here in 1982
to be with his only daughter. ``One is my neighbor in Baku. That's
my city where I was born.''
   ``The Villain'' is typical of the films being shown during the
superpower summit this week at a Soviet film festival. Together,
they amount to a celluloid catharsis.
   Virtually every film is a grim look at some aspect of the Soviet
Union's cruel history or current troubles. Occasionally the gloom is
disguised as farce, but the themes are the same _ Siberian prisons,
Stalinist oppression, heroic resistance, bureaucratic hypocrisy and
the guilt of torturers.

   Children under 18 are fined $25 if caught
smoking cigarettes in Woodridge, Ill., one of the few places where
laws against smoking by minors are enforced.
   ``It is well documented that these laws are seldom enforced,''
U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Antonia Novello said Thursday, noting that
44 states have statutes forbidding tobacco sales to minors.
   ``More than 3,000 teen-agers become regular smokers each day,''
she said. ``If current smoking rates were to continue in the United
States, then about 5 million of the children now living in this
country would die of smoking-related disease.''
   Those statistics so concerned Woodridge Police Officer Bruce
Talbot that he wrote a city ordinance against smoking by youths. He
said the Illinois statute was too weak to be effective.

   Researchers have taken a step they think could
help them better understand AIDS, using a cloned virus to infect
monkeys with an AIDS-like disease.
   This is the first time a laboratory-developed virus has been used
to cause an AIDS-type infection, the researchers reported in a paper
published today in the journal Science.
   ``The importance of this is that we can now ... make very precise
changes (in the virus) and try and predict what will happen,''
explained Harry Kestler of Harvard University's New England Regional
Primate Research Center.
   Because all copies of a cloned virus are identical, scientists
can compare the results of an infection with the original virus with
infections from a virus in which they have made specific changes.

   The 1990 Atlantic hurricane season
begins today amid dire warnings that killer storms on the East and
Gulf coasts in the last two years may have been harbingers of a new
era of destructive storms.
   The hurricane season runs until Nov. 30 and was ushered in by a
tropical depression last week in the Caribbean that brought heavy
rain to Cuba and south Florida but did not intensify into a
hurricane.
   Many coastal communities, with swelling populations, are
ill-prepared to handle a hurricane emergency, said Robert Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center.
   A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report
predicts the number of people in seaside counties from Maine to
Texas will grow 60 percent, counting from 1960 until 2010. Some
states such as Florida and Texas will experience near 200 percent
growth during the period, the report said.

<DATELINE>WUHAN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   E Desheng, a 27-year-old tea seller who has
never left home, is a veteran traveler of the socialist road,
sensitive to political nuances.
   E lives in rural Huashan township and says he has not ventured
farther than Wuhan, the provincial capital 12 miles away. Like
almost everyone in this tightly regimented nation, however, he reads
the signs from Beijing, 700 miles to the north.
   A member of the Communist Youth League, he attends weekly
meetings ``to study how to keep on the socialist road and take the
lead in learning from Lei Feng,'' a legendary footsoldier venerated
for selflessly doing good deeds and loving the Communist Party.
   Emulating Lei and protecting socialism from ``bourgeois
liberalism'' are central themes of the nationwide ideological
campaign that began after the government sent troops to crush the
pro-democracy movement a year ago.
   Whatever his expressed interest in politics, the young tea seller
speaks with far more animation of his two-story home and 3-year-old
son. Like most Chinese in the countryside, he probably keeps up with
politics only in hopes of achieving a more prosperous life.
   A recent press tour of Hubei province in central China, organized
by the Foreign Ministry, revealed how difficult it is even for
ordinary citizens to escape Beijing's latest political campaign.
   Zuo Wenqing, an official in Huashan, said political education had
been increased. ``On orders of the central government, we
strengthened the connection between cadres and workers and taught
farmers to love the country, lead a simple life and work harder,''
he said.
   Ma Yue, executive vice president of the 80,000-worker Second
Automobile Works in Shiyan, western Hubei, said classes were begun
after the June 1989 crackdown to study the works of Deng Xiaoping
and other party leaders.
   ``Political education is quite important,'' Ma said. ``We
shouldn't be motivated only by money.''
   People in Hubei are bombarded by political slogans on roadsides,
in publications and in factories.
   Many deal with such mundane issues as family planning or traffic
safety. Others, including stone carvings embedded in railroad
embankments that read ``Long Live the Communist Party,'' probably
date from the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   One slogan in a small Huashan collective factory, reflecting the
now-muzzled economic reform sentiments of the mid-1980s, proclaimed:
``Time is money, profit is life.''
   Lei Feng slogans have begun appearing in every factory. ``The
spirit of Lei Feng is the traditional virtue of the Chinese
people,'' said one in a Wuhan machinery plant.
   Another, at a textile factory in Xiangfan City run by the army,
read: ``The great successes of the past 40 years would be impossible
without the Communist Party leadership, socialism and the government
policy of democratic dictatorship.''
   During the Beijing pro-democracy demonstrations last year, about
1,000 students protested in Xiangfan, young people surrounded the
Second Automobile Works in Shiyan and, in Wuhan, protesters blocked
the train and auto bridge across the Yangtze River for three days.
   Wuhan, an industrial city of 3 million, has been a center of
political activism for generations. Wuhan rebels helped bring down
the Qing dynasty after the turn of the century, the young Communist
Party operated from there in the 1920s and some of the bloodiest
fighting of the Cultural Revolution occurred in Wuhan.
   Despite the tradition, most Hubei residents probably are just
going through the motions of the latest political campaign, like
their counterparts in Beijing.
   As in the rest of China, all Communist Party members in Hubei
factories and offices have been told to register again. The purpose
is to weed out those tainted by pro-democracy sympathies, but it
appears few in Hubei are in danger of expulsion.
   Huang Mobin, president of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corp., which
has 120,000 employees, said with pride that not a single worker went
to Beijing last year to join the demonstrations.
   ``It's true that workers dislike unequal distribution of property
and profiteering, but they are more dissatisfied with the students
and instability,'' he said.
   Often, the rhetoric is little more than a handy way to avoid
prying questions.
   Mayor Wu Fayu of Shiyan, after a speech attributing the city's
progress to the Communist Party, the study of Marx and Mao and
folowing the socialist road, was asked how Mao Tse-tung's thought
guided him in his daily work.
   ``His general thought is a crystallization of the wisdom of the
people,'' was the cryptic reply.
   A department store manager in Wuhan claimed following the
socialist road was the key to his store's success.
   He then said he was adopting new marketing systems that would
foster competition between different sections of the store.
   Blaring in the background was a soundtrack of the American movie
``Saturday Night Fever.''

<HEAD>More Than One Way To Deal With Budget Deficits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By forces only dimly understood, Americans are
said to have changed their minds about one of the most fundamental
financial issues of mankind, and now seem ready to accept higher
taxes.
   A smattering of surveys indicate as much. It is considered a
``given'' in many financial and business analyses. And even the
president of the United States, elected on a pledge of no increases,
has suggested he might reconsider.
   However it was done, the selling of the idea of higher taxes
might make a study worthy of the most esteemed educational
institutions. Only this much is known: Many people think an increase
is the only way to cut the budget deficit.
   That, too, might make an academic study, because only a few years
have passed since the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost
Control, headed by J. Peter Grace, recommended $424 billion in cuts
over three years.
   No more use was made of the study than is made of those
shellacked sets of encyclopedias that reside on shelves beside the
television set and the other pieces of furniture.
   In 1985, the year after the study, Congress raised spending by
$94.5 billion and very little has been heard of the findings since
then, although Grace, chairman of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., did his best to
keep the publicity at a high pitch.
   The entire thesis of that volume was the wastefulness of
government and the growing danger that it would bankrupt the nation
unless corrected. Its subtitle could very well have been: Cut Waste
Rather Than Raise Taxes.
   Now the deficit is thought to be at a crisis level by people in
all areas of life, members of Congress to be sure, but heads of
corporations too, and a tax increase is thought the only way to
reduce it.
   It isn't the first time Congress has ignored the option of
cutting spending rather than raising taxes and it isn't likely to be
the last. Not if you can judge by the recent evidence.
   With assistance from fellow scholars, Scott Hodge, federal budget
analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative
think tank, came up with a list of $130 billion in cuts he says
would cause minimal damage.
   Among other things, he would ask Congress to break its addiction
to pork barrel spending. That's a lot to ask of elected officials,
of course, because their success often is seen as receiving more
from Washington than constituents send there.
   But some pork barrelling, Hodge indicates, might be of no help
back home or anywhere else either. Such as $2,500 to finance a study
on the causes of rudeness, lying and cheating on tennis courts, an
$84,000 study of why people fall in love, and $107,000 to study the
Japanese quail's sex life.
   Just peanuts, you say. Well, then, consider the recent aid
package for Panama and Nicaragua. Congress cut it back to $420
million from the $800 million requested by President Bush. That was
Congress' price for agreeing to such aid.
   It wasn't the only price. To the bill, members of Congress tacked
on more than that amount for domestic projects, many of them their
favorite spending programs.
   Among them: A sum of $400,000 to fill in a collapsed utility
tunnel in Salisbury, N.C., sought by a congressman from that state,
and $990,000 to repair a waterfront park in Bay City, Mich., by a
congressman from that area.
   In this way did a foreign aid package for Panama and Nicaragua
hide a large domestic spending program. Spending is in; cutting is
out. Hodge says Congress even ignores revelations of wasteful
spending by its own research arms.
   Last November, for example, the General Accounting Office found
more than $150 billion in program waste, fraud and financial
mismanagement. And only three months ago the Congressional Budget
Office recommended reforms it said would yield savings of roughly
$60 billion in the first year...
   ... if implemented.

   Debra Gilbert was in her nightgown fixing
breakfast when an ax broke through the front door. As a dozen police
officers waving shotguns swarmed her house, she heard her husband
yell, ``She doesn't know anything. She doesn't know.''
   What she didn't know was that her husband of four years was
connected to the mob. She didn't know he had killed three times. And
she didn't know the shambles her life would become.
   Yet even after she knew, she stood by him when he agreed to
testify against organized crime buddies, living a bizarre life of
fear that included time in a three-room police station apartment.
   She watched as her husband manipulated authorities, serving his
murder sentence while living the high life complete with
thousand-dollar expense accounts and beach house vacations. When
Peter Gilbert died of a heart attack in June 1988, he still was in
custody, but was driving alone to go skydiving, in a Buick stocked
with cocaine.
   ``I know a lot of people out there would say, `Boy, she's the
biggest fool who ever walked this earth,''' Mrs. Gilbert said in an
interview at her Brooksville, Fla., home. But ``how many people can
say they loved someone enough to love them blindly?''
   The case of Peter Gilbert offers an unusual glimpse into the
sometimes peculiar world of crime and punishment, where a man so
skilled in manipulation can take not only his wife for a ride, but
also police and prosecutors.
   His escapade rocked Providence's police department and led Gov.
Edward D. DiPrete to order a state police investigation. Fourteen
officers face disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct, and a
special prosecutor was named April 30 to take the case to a grand
jury for possible criminal indictments.
   A state judge is even considering overturning a conviction that
was based on Peter Gilbert's testimony because of all the lies.
   The ``fiasco,'' as the internal investigation calls it, is
expected to cost nearly $1 million by the time all the probes are
completed.
   ``Then the state of Rhode Island and especially myself will be
able to put pieces together and not feel like there is anything
missing anymore,'' Mrs. Gilbert said.
   A consummate con man, Peter Gilbert made up in charisma what he
lacked in conscience. He told Debra their marriage was his first,
when it was at least his fifth. Standing 5 feet 5 inches, with a
scruffy beard and tattoos, Peter hardly seemed the lady's man. Debra
knew he had children, but she wasn't one to ask a lot of questions.
   When they met in Florida, she was a high school dropout with
three young children. Peter lived next door when the man she had
married at 16 walked out.
   ``He was my hero that came along and loved me and my children,''
she said in her soft Southern lilt.
   She married him in 1981 in the Brooksville courthouse, believing
he was James Harold Cassidy. The charade crumbled a year later when
he was arrested for burglarizing a church and a lumberyard. Police
said he was Peter Gilbert, a man who lived half his life as a
criminal.
   ``I couldn't understand why he lied to me. I left him,'' she said.
   Peter told her he lied only to get away from his past. He said he
stole to pay for the birth of their newborn daughter, Kiya. He wrote
poems from jail to win her forgiveness:
   ``Now that Kiya binds our love there is no yesterday;
   ``Just tomorrow, just for us, our love will show the way.''
   A few months later, Peter escaped by knocking out another man in
a holding cell who was to go before a judge on a minor charge. Peter
took his place, pleaded guilty to the other man's infraction, and
walked free.
   He fled to Rhode Island. Against the advice of family and
friends, Debra quit her waitressing job in Brooksville to join him
after a one-year separation.
   ``I was raising four kids and they missed him,'' she said. ``He
said I was his life and after calling me all the time, I believed
him.''
   In Rhode Island, she wondered why his beeper, supposedly for his
job at an auto body shop, went off at all hours with strange
messages. She asked enough to learn he was ``involved'' with drugs,
but didn't pry.
   ``I didn't want to know, to be honest,'' said Debra, now 30.
   Peter's drug use became so bad he asked her to wake him by
injecting him with cocaine. She refused, but stayed at his side _
telling herself he just needed help.
   When police stormed her Providence home in early 1985, Debra
learned about the murders _ all involving drug users or traffickers.
   ``I tried to imagine him doing something like that,'' she said.
``I couldn't, no matter how hard I tried.''
   Authorities offered Peter an unusual deal in exchange for his
testimony. He would serve his 10-year sentence in Providence police
custody, then be relocated. The dream of starting over helped keep
Debra with her husband. So did Peter's tales of threats against the
family, and prosecutors' pleas he was a more believable witness with
his wife by his side.
   She sent her three older children to her mother in Florida and
she and 2-year-old Kiya were allowed to join Peter in the police
station.
   The three lived together in a cell for a few weeks while a former
matrons' quarters was converted into a three-room air-conditioned
apartment. It had a telephone, television, videocassette recorder
and queen-sized water bed. But it was adjacent to the women's cells,
and the noise and screaming were incessant.
   ``It was definitely our home,'' said Debra. ``But it was like
jail, too. ... I think I always felt like I was breathing germs.''
   Peter passed the time watching TV, sharing a beer with his
guards, fishing with the mayor's chauffeur. He started an
autobiography. He was allowed out, and sometimes stayed away
overnight.
   Debra was immobilized by fear. Afraid to go out, she spent more
time in jail than Peter. She began to fear the food might be
poisoned and made her daughter wait while she tasted some first. The
strain finally proved too much and she moved back to Florida.
   ``I couldn't take it anymore: the women screaming, the officers.
My daughter was not going to be raised in that kind of
environment,'' she said.
   Two years later, in 1988, she went back to Peter at a rural Rhode
Island safe house prosecutors provided. Debra said she told police
that Peter was using cocaine and packaging drugs in the cellar, but
was told to keep quiet. A departmental review supports her
allegation.
   ``It can reasonably be inferred that Gilbert supplemented his
state income with his profits from narcotics sales,'' the review
said.
   She stayed just seven weeks. Two months later, Peter, who had a
history of heart trouble, died of a heart attack following a fight
at a Connecticut gas station, according to a medical examiner's
report.
   Debra continues to wrestle with her husband's lies. Peter told
the children he lived in the police station because he was an
undercover officer. She hasn't yet found a way to tell them the
truth.
   But she is hopeful about the future. She recently remarried and
insists, this time, she is less naive.
   ``I have started a new life with a very good man,'' she said.
``It's just a good feeling.''

<HEAD>NBC Affiliates Meet to Ponder Good News, Bad News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual NBC affiliates' convention, normally
held in Los Angeles, begins in Washington today.
   The main reason? A Tuesday trip to Capitol Hill by affiliate
executives to discuss cable- and NBC-related matters.
   The executives of NBC's 208 affiliated stations should be happy,
considering the network last month won its fifth straight season in
prime time. But there is trouble in Peacock City.
   Among other things:
   _ NBC's prime-time ratings last season were the lowest in its
history, down 9 percent from 1988-89.
   _ ``Today,'' whose Nielsen dive began after last year's
much-criticized changes that led to the exit of Jane Pauley and the
entrance of Deborah Norville, has run second to ABC's ``Good Morning
America'' for 21 weeks.
   _ Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News'' has been third in the news
ratings for seven consecutive weeks.
   The executives, of course, also will be pondering what incoming
affiliate chairman Eric Bremner calls an ``audacious and bold'' move
for next season by Fox Broadcasting _ pitting ``The Simpsons''
against ``The Cosby Show.''
   ``I think Fox has taken one hell of a gamble,'' says Bremner's
predecessor as affiliate chairman, James R. Sefert. ``But this is
just the kind of challenge that makes Bill Cosby work all the
harder.``
   Although The Simpsons vs. The Coz likely will be the talk of the
gathering, much of the executives' attention will be on the news
division.
   Its president, Michael Gartner, last month commenced repair
programs for ``Today'' and the ``NBC Nightly News'' in sudden,
back-to-back moves that more than a few TV writers saw as two steps
back to the future.
   For ``Today,'' he re-hired former host Joe Garagiola, who'll be
on the show three days a week. With CBS anchor Faith Daniels, hired
as the show's news anchor, he'll join co-hosts Norville and Byrant
Gumbel on June 11.
   And Gartner re-hired Steve Friedman, the brash former ``Today''
executive producer who helped that show achieve dominance. Gartner
made him executive producer of ``Nightly News.''
   Gartner is scheduled to talk to the affiliates today about the
changes and other plans. It remains to be seen whether he'll come
under heavy fire from the station executives at Wednesday's
closed-door final session.
   ``I don't know if there's going to be hostility, but there is
deep concern'' about the state of the two programs, says Sefert,
president of Cosmos Broadcasting Corp. in Greenville, S.C.
   ``We hope to get an explanation of the rationale behind moves
that have been made so far,'' says Bremner, of King Broadcasting Co.
in Seattle, Wash. He doubts that the fiesty Gartner will face sharp
verbal attacks.
   ``But yes, the affiliates are very definitely concerned and
anxious to see positive results from the changes that have been
made,'' he says.
   The affiliates also will hear Gartner discuss a proposal to make
an NBC News service called A-News a 24-hour news and sports-news
operation, one that would resemble CNN only in its round-the-clock
schedule.
   A-News currently sends affiliates reports from NBC News and
affiliate stations seven times a day, starting at 11 a.m. EDT and
ending at 2:30 a.m. EDT, NBC says. The reports are separate from
NBC's regular newscasts and are for use in local stations' newscasts.
   The expanded service might include an anchor in the early morning
hours when NBC isn't broadcasting.
   The proposed new service ``has to be viewed as a positive turn of
events,'' Bremner says. ``If it's done as well as NBC intends to do
it, it will be a major resource for the affiliates.''
   During Tuesday's Capitol Hill trip, Sefert says, the affiliate
executives will meet with their congressmen to seek:
   _ Hearings on the issue of cable companies that transmit local
broadcast signals without paying for them. The NBC stations don't
seek laws requiring payment, he says, but want ``a solution that is
acceptable to everybody.''
   _ Capitol Hill support for whatever the Federal Communications
Commission decides on proposals to let the networks have a financial
interest in programs they air that were brought in by outside
producers.
   The major networks currently are barred from a financial interest
in such programs by the FCC's financial-syndication rules. But the
FCC currently is re-examining the rules in light of the growth of
cable.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   HAIL TO THE PAIR: Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer have worked
together for 15 years in what has evolved into public television's
``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour.'' So their production company, which says
their partnership is the longest of its kind in TV history, says the
two will be the subject a 90-minute PBS special this fall. Which it

<HEAD>How A Crunch Spreads</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It might be wise to listen to all those
complaints of a credit crunch, even if many of them are coming
``merely'' from builders and developers.
   A credit crunch anywhere in the economy can spread economic woe
far and wide.
   Many business economists have tended to discredit credit crunch
claims, arguing that the national statistics fail to show one; much
of the evidence is anecdotal; and any problem is restricted to
builders.
   Other analysts contend, however, that even a slight infection in
just one limb can spread quickly to the entire body. Builders
clearly are involved in a credit crunch, which they say is bound to
hurt other businesses.
   This becomes clear when you consider the ingredients, the trades
and skills, the manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers involved in
building just one, 1,700-square-foot single-family home.
   Lumber, of course, some 9,726 board feet of it. And 55 cubic
yards of concrete, 1,992 square feet of asphalt shingles for
roofing, 2,500 square feet of insulation, 6,484 square feet of wall
board and 90 feet of ducting.
   If you find it difficult to visualize those items, then consider
these: 55 gallons of paint, 302 pounds of nails, 12 windows, three
bathtubs, three sinks, 15 kitchen cabinets, and, of course, the
range, refrigerator, dishwasher ...
   All of those items must be assembled in a housing unit, and that
involves people such as architects, draftsmen, surveyors, masons,
plumbers, roofers, painters, paperhangers, electricians and a dozen
other vital trades.
   Most of these are local business people, but the locals order
from regional suppliers who get their materials from factories,
which are situated throughout the country and which order from raw
material suppliers.
   In all, according to the National Association of Home Builders,
which bases its estimate on U.S. government figures, the
construction of just one house means 1.8 man-years of employment.
   Translated, that could mean almost 22 months of work for one
person or, for example, about three month's work for seven.
   Thus, while the credit crunch in building may not to date have
made an impression in national statistics, smart economists,
including Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, are concerned.
   Martin Perlman, NAHB president, says the crunch already is
destructive. ``Builders are being indiscriminately cut off from the
credit markets. Production is dropping. People are losing their jobs
and businesses,'' he says.
   He cites an association survey in which 60 percent of 1,142
responding builders said changes in lending practices at thrifts and
commercial banks have affected their plans for 1990.
   These are the key findings in regard to thrifts, perhaps better
known as savings and loans associations:
   _About 49 percent of the respondents said savings institutions
are reducing the amount they can borrow in the future for land
acquisition, land development or construction.
   _Fifty-two percent said thrifts no longer will make land
acquisition loans.
   _Forty-six percent said thrifts no longer will make land
development loans.
   _Thirty percent said thrifts no longer will make construction
loans.
   To some extent, the attitude of savings and loan associations is
more understandable than that of commercial banks, because S&amp;Ls are
under greater pressure from regulators to maintain sound lending
practices.
   Some restraints shown by commercial banks are self-imposed,
following big losses in speculative ventures. But the builders
survey indicates that even sound builders are facing a variety of
credit denials.
   Thirty percent of respondents, for example, said they've been
asked for additional collateral on existing loans and 35 percent
said banks now seek excessive documentation. Some, they said, are
calling loans before maturity.
   All this might not to date have shown up in national statistics
so revered by some economists. But as other economists point out,
statistics are historical records, not measures of current events.

<TEXT>
   While other world leaders fight to stay
in power, and some try to fend off reform, the head of the world's 6
million Tibetans has the opposite problem.
   The Dalai Lama's people are uncomfortable with democracy and do
not want him to retire as their political leader.
   But then, most other political figures aren't considered living
gods.
   ``I am insisting on stepping down,'' the Dalai Lama said in an
interview. ``It is of greatest urgency that democracy comes to us.
It is the most creative way for the human spirit.''
   In his ornate parlor overlooking the snow-capped Himalayas, the
Dalai Lama predicted communism soon would fall in China and his
followers would return to their homeland within 10 years.
   Tibetans believe their mountainous region, with its unique
culture, should be an independent nation. China claims Tibet has
been part of its territory since the 13th century.
   To prepare for their return, the Dalai Lama said, Tibetans must
embrace democracy and shed the idea that he is a god.
   It is proving difficult. There is strong conservative opposition
to the Dalai Lama's plans to democratize his government-in-exile and
few, if any, Tibetans seem willing to abandon the belief that ``His
Holiness'' is divine.
   That belief has made Tibetans ``lazy,'' said the 54-year-old
Buddhist leader, who won the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize. ``They think I
will do everything for them.''
   Tibetans circle his residence, pausing to clasp their hands in
prayer. Elderly women, limping with age, climb steep grades to gaze
at his compound, whispering ``10,000 years to His Holiness.''
   Tibetan Buddhist tradition holds that the first Dalai Lama, born
in 1391, was a reincarnation of Chenresi, the Buddhist god of mercy.
Subsequent Dalai Lamas are revered as reincarnations of their
predecessors.
   The current Dalai Lama, the 14th, was chosen in 1936 after a
series of visions indicated the leader would be found in a house
with turquoise tiles in eastern Tibet.
   When he first told Tibetans of his wish to give up his political
position, the Dalai Lama said, ``many people were shocked and they
told me I should not say this kind of thing.
   ``But I continuously spoke out,'' he said, with a playful grin.
   He remains a reluctant politician, a man of the spirit, not of
law or intrigue. Clothed in maroon and saffron robes and wearing his
ever-present tinted glasses, the Dalai Lama chuckled, cracked jokes
and reached out to squeeze the hand of a reporter as he made a point.
   ``I am just a Tibetan monk,'' he said, running his fingers over
wooden prayer beads. ``I would rather go to an isolated monastery
and pray. Now I have no time for prayer. I am always busy, busy with
the affairs of this world.''

   A new exhibit in Budapest recalls the
shadow of Stalinism that covered half of Europe for more than 40
years.
   It is called ``Sta-lin! Ra-ko-si!'' and is the first in Eastern
Europe to depict the day-to-day life of the 1950s.
   Hungary's Stalin was Matyas Rakosi, who was installed by the
Soviet dictator and ruled unchallenged. Stalin died in 1953, byt
Rakosi's reign lasted until the 1956 uprising against Stalinism,
which was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   The exhibit, constructed like a labyrinth, is in a castle on a
hill above the Danube River. It includes newspaper headlines,
photographs, uniforms of feared men, soiled clothing of the beaten
and belongings of the executed.
   Emil Horn, who conceived it, said he wanted to juxtapose the
truth and the Rakosi regime's representation of itself.
   ``Those days were very sad,'' He said in an interview. ``Now,
there is a great irony.''
   A giant reprint of a cartoon from the period depicts mice
marching behind a placard of a grinning cat. Next to it are equally
large photos of Hungarians marching behind portraits of Rakosi and
Stalin.
   The exhibit focuses on the Rakosi era, but repeatedly draws
comparisons with the Soviet Union, showing nearly identical
uniforms, medals and even constitutions.
   A cast-bronze head of Rakosi adorns a three-tier podium,
recalling the cakes each village, factory and school sent him on his
60th birthday.
   The podium is piled high with presents: hand-stitched banners,
painted vases and flasks depicting the glories of communism. There
is sheet music of hymns to the leader.
   Up a few steps, in a mausoleum-like chamber, are even more
elaborate gifts to Stalin.
   The exhibit also notes differences between Stalinism in the
Soviet Union and Hungary.
   ``Here, it lasted only seven to eight years,'' Horn said. ``Due
to the liberal trends in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and the whole
region, it would have taken much longer to completely suppress the
people than in Russia.''
   Horn is a former Communist who believed firmly in Marxism when
the Soviets liberated Hungary. About what came later, he said: ``We
are ashamed of ourselves.''
   His exhibit ``contains my personal self-criticism as well,'' Horn
said. ``For me, it is a kind of absolution. I didn't hurt anyone,
but still, it is absurd that I and so many people were so stupid.
... Why was I so ignorant?'' Millions of people in Eastern Europe
are asking themselves that question.
   In his New Year's address, President Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia said all Czechoslovaks shared responsibility for
Communist rule and cautioned against simply blaming leaders for the
excesses.
   An exhibit about Czechoslovakia's history since 1918 opened in
Prague last month. It is part of a general effort in what once was
the Soviet bloc to express the truth of history and strip away
Stalinist falsehoods.
   Budapest's Rakosi exhibit shows how the Communists rigged the
1947 elections, then chronicles the dissolution of other parties,
collectivization of land and experiments in economic
self-sufficiency that even included a short-lived attempt to grow
cotton.
   The second part of the exhibit has the atmosphere of an
interrogation chamber, courtroom and prison camp.
   Documents listing charges against prominent victims of the Rakosi
regime are displayed along with photographs and personal belongings.
They include Cardinal Jozsef Mindszenty and former Interior Minister
Laszlo Rajk, who was hanged as a ``Titoist.''
   In a depiction of the notorious labor camp at Recsk, where many
people died, are huge prints of photos taken secretly by an inmate
who now lives in the West.
   A small cabinet displays such banned materials as Carlo Collodi's
``Pinocchio,'' Disney cartoons and ``The Jungle Book,'' by Rudyard
Kipling
   Looming over the exit is a border guard tower bearing two
figures: 18,000, the number of people allowed to travel outside the
country in 1951, and 10 million, the number in 1989.
   Across from the tower are statues of Rakosi and Stalin, toppled,
as they were after protesters pulled them down at beginning of the
uprising Oct. 23, 1956. Stalin's fist is in the dirt.
   One visitor wrote in the guest book: ``Thank God we haven't seen
this in our lives.'' Another wrote below: ``Unfortunately we have.''
   Still another echoed Horn: ``I'm ashamed that the Hungarian
people were willing to accept all this for decades.''

<HEAD>Insiders Saw Stock Rally Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As unexpected as the stock market's latest
upsurge to record highs may have been, it certainly didn't seem to
catch corporate insiders by surprise.
   Before the market began to take off five weeks ago, top managers,
directors and major shareholders of corporations had been stepping
up buying of their stocks for months, to levels seldom seen over the
past two decades.
   By so doing they put some fresh luster on their reputation as a
force to be reckoned with in the search for the right stock to buy
at the right time.
   Since the waning months of 1989, according to tallies by various
investment advisory services, insiders have been consistently buying
more shares of their companies' stocks than they have sold in
open-market transactions.
   To regular followers of the insiders' activities, that
represented an even stronger endorsement of the market outlook than
it might appear at first glance.
   Insiders often obtain stock through private means such as
employee purchase plans and the exercise of options they receive as
part of their pay.
   Thus, in their open-market activity, analysts say they typically
can be expected to be sellers about two-thirds of the time and
buyers in the remaining one-third or so of transactions.
   ``Because they're often compensated with company stock, about
twice as many insiders normally sell than buy,'' said Stephen Leeb
in the newsletter Personal Finance.
   ``But for the last few months, buyers have actually outnumbered
sellers. Every time this has happened in the past, stocks across the
board have rallied.''
   In calculating his ``Insider Indicator,'' Norman Fosback, editor
of the advisory publication The Insiders, puts the ``normal buying
line'' at 35 percent of the total transactions.
   For a five-week period through mid-May, the indicator stood at a
``very bullish'' 60 percent.
   ``The insiders are again telling the market that higher stock
price levels are ahead,'' Fosback said. ``The only way to describe
their current activity is a `buying panic.'''
   The rationale for tracking the activities of insiders is
straightforward enough. Fosback calls them ``America's most
knowledgeable investors.''
   Or as Leeb observes, ``What really drives stocks in the long run
is what's happening on America's factory floors.
   ``Who are the best witnesses? Corporate insiders _ officers and
directors who have firsthand knowledge of their firms' strengths AND
weaknesses.''
   The close-up view does not always lead to unerring insight.
Insiders had it right in 1980 and 1983, when they grew cautious just
ahead of periods of flat or declining stock prices.
   They gave no such warning, however, in 1987 leading up to the
crash on Black Monday, Oct. 19 of that year.
   As if to make up for that omission, they stampeded in with buy
orders after the crash, betting correctly that the market would
rebound. Through the 2{ years since then, they have remained
consistently if a little less spectacularly bullish.
   When stocks tumbled early this year, it appeared as though a bear
market might have set in, catching corporate insiders unaware. But
now, says Fosback, ``the latest upside price burst has once again
vindicated the insiders.''

<HEAD>Many Survivors Only Now Dealing With Holocaust Trauma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only now, 45 years after World War II ended in
Europe, are many Jewish survivors coming to grips with the trauma
they suffered at the hands of Nazi Germany.
   A recent survey found that 302,404 of the nearly 1 million
Holocaust survivors who fled to Israel from Europe were still alive.
Most are 65 to 80, an age at which experts say they will be taking
stock of their lives.
   ``The natural process of aging takes people back to deal with
their pasts, to make an account with their souls,'' said Ilana
Nahmias, director of Amcha, which provides psychological counseling
for survivors.
   Many seek a sympathetic ear for their nightmares, paranoia,
loneliness.
   Scores have turned to Amcha, which has about 35 volunteer workers
at its offices in Jerusalem and Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv.
Many of the volunteers are children of survivors.
   Amcha, a non-profit organization, was the first recipient of
reparations from East Germany, in the form of a $3.6 million grant
in April. Its name means ``people'' or ``your people'' in Hebrew,
and was a password Holocaust survivors in Europe used to identify
each other.
   Its cases include:
   _ A 60-year-old man who spent the war years hiding from the Nazis
with the help of farmers, and never shared his experiences with his
family. The home atmosphere became tense and his children had
trouble ``fitting into the outside world.''
   _ A 72-year-old survivor, not given to dwelling on the past, who
began thinking constantly of his life in a concentration camp. He
was overwhelmed by a need to talk, but did not want to burden his
wife with his private terrors because she, too, had lived through
the Holocaust.
   _ A man in his 70s who could not sleep because of a secret he
could not tell his daughter: that he had had a first wife and son
who were killed by the Nazis while he stood helpless.
   Counseling helped the first two and their families, but the third
man left the program after one session and refused the center's
proposal to arrange for his daughter to join him in a meeting with
counselors.
   Nahmias said there were several cases of survivors who had not
told relatives and close friends about first families, either
because it was too painful or because they felt shame for not
preventing the deaths.
   ``We don't say we can cure pain,'' she said. ``We have no recipe.
But many feel they are going to explode, that they have to tell
about their experience now or it will be lost. If they feel a little
better, it's a lot.''
   Some prefer talking to a tape recorder, she said, and the center
has 200 hours of recorded testimonies.
   ``The survivor can come and talk about what he wants,'' said
Nahmias, a former colonel in the army women's corps. ``We don't try
to find out if it's true or matches historical events. It's enough
if that's how he remembers something or how he wants to be
remembered.''
   Several cases involve survivors who were children during the
Holocaust. About 50,000 child victims live in Israel. To protect
their privacy, Nahmias did not reveal the names of any of the
survivors.
   The Amcha director related the case of a 55-year-old woman who,
when her daughter left home to get married, was suddenly faced again
with the fear of separation she felt as a child. While on the run
from the Nazis, she had been passed from family to family 17 times.
   Nahmias said many child survivors were reluctant to speak of
their experiences because they felt the suffering of those in the
death camps was so much greater.
   ``I didn't want to talk as a child; I was ashamed of it,'' said
Yossi Peled, who survived by hiding with a Christian family in
Belgium and now is a major general in Israel's army.
   Eli and Shoshana Heyman, a German-born couple who survived work
camps and Auschwitz and now work as Amcha volunteers, said Holocaust
victims have difficulty speaking of it because non-survivors cannot
relate to their experience.
   ``Sometimes you see it in their eyes; they want to understand,
but they can't,'' said Shoshana Heyman, who is in charge of Amcha's
archives. ``It's impossible. When you want to explain, it sounds so
horrid that you can't explain.''
   She said they did not tell the ``terrible things'' even to their
children, but were able to talk with other survivors.
   Eli Heyman, a retired communal farmer who counsels lonely and
troubled Holocaust victims, said he was haunted by the fact that
survivors had such difficulty finding happiness.
   ``What bothers me is that people who went through the Holocaust,
in the end do not get by so well,'' he said. ``One has money, but he
does not get by. He is not at one with himself. He is divided. You
are not happy and that is the problem.
   ``It is a not a remedy for a doctor, to ask someone what hurts.''
Although he provides counseling, Heyman said, ``I know it is not
possible to find a solution.''

<HEAD>Controversy Over Pumice Mine Centers on Fashion, Old Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA CUEVA, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Bob Crostic bought his first pair of
stonewashed jeans recently, he discovered a small chunk of pumice in
one of the pockets.
   There was more than a bit of irony in the find.
   Crostic, a staffer with the U.S. Forest Service, oversees an
open-pit pumice mine in the Santa Fe National Forest that is at the
center of a noisy dispute about the use of public lands.
   Because some of the pumice is used to stonewash or acid-wash
fabric, critics contend the forest is being sacrificed for fashion,
and ``Fashion vs. Forest'' has become their rallying cry.
   The Las Conchas Pumice Mine looks like a moonscape, the dazzling
white of the pumice piles offset only by a couple of heaps of
burned, blackened tree stumps.
   ``Great stuff to mine,'' Crostic told recent visitors as he
grabbed a handful of the lightweight, volcanic rock and sifted it
through his fingers.
   Last spring, as work began to prepare the mine site in northern
New Mexico's scenic Jemez Mountains, about 20 members of the
environmental group Earth First! converged to protest the operation.
Three were arrested when they locked themselves to earthmoving
equipment.
   At issue is a 19th-century federal law that allows private
citizens to mine and appropriate public lands at negligible cost.
   The law, enacted to encourage mineral development, says that
anyone who finds a valuable mineral deposit on public lands may
stake a claim and mine it or patent the claim and purchase the land.
   While coal, oil, gas, sand, stone and other minerals have been
removed from its provisions, the General Mining Law of 1872 still
covers metals such as gold, lead, copper and zinc, as well as pumice.
   Copar Pumice Co., which had staked claims in the area, received
approval last summer from the Forest Service to strip-mine 33 acres
in the national forest about 15 miles west of Los Alamos. Copar then
must restore the site once mining is finished by recontouring it and
planting grass and trees.
   Environmentalists went to court, contending the mine's impact had
not been adequately assessed, but mining continues while the case is
pending.
   In September, Copar owner Richard Cook applied for a patent, or
outright ownership, of 1,700 acres surrounding the mine.
   Under the 1872 law, if the tract is determined to contain
valuable pumice, Cook can buy the land for $2.50 an acre. Once he
owns the property, no state or federal reclamation laws would
require him to restore the site after mining.
   ``It's essentially a major ripoff of public land under an archaic
law,'' said Henry Oat of Santa Fe, who heads the East Fork
Preservation Coalition.
   The operating mine is barely a fourth of a mile from the East
Fork of the Jemez River, a pristine trout stream that has been
approved by Congress for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic
Rivers system.
   Nearly 180 acres of the land Cook seeks fall within the
quarter-mile corridor on either side of the river that would be
protected by the federal designation, which awaits President Bush's
approval.
   The legislation prohibits Cook from patenting the 180 acres along
the river, but he cannot be prevented from mining it because he has
valid claims. He has said, though, that he would not mine it because
that would spoil the view from the river.
   ``We don't intend to destroy the landscape or the area in any
way,'' he said from his office in Espanola.
   Cook also said he has no plans for the 1,700 acres other than to
mine it, but his opponents fear he would develop condominiums or
other commercial ventures in the forest.
   Environmentalists also are worried that the beautiful Jemez area,
a popular tourist destination, will turn into a pumice-mining center.
   The Copar pumice is the remnant of a volcanic explosion 150,000
years ago and is considered valuable because of its large-sized
chunks, its purity and its proximity to the highway.
   Pumice goes into products ranging from building materials to
toothpaste.
   Its use as an industrial abrasive, including stonewashing
garments to give them an aged appearance, is a small but growing
segment of the market, said Donna Smith, a mineral economist who
lives near the mine.
   Copar, however, is not a major pumice supplier to the garment
industry. Cook said about 10 percent of the mine's pumice goes for
stonewashing, far less than was anticipated when the mine opened.
   ``The garment industry just isn't taking all the large chunks
now,'' Cook said.
   Most of Copar's pumice is used for construction, he said.
   Industry spokesmen say much of the pumice used by major garment
manufacturers is imported.
   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., for example, buys its pumice from Turkey for
its products that are stone- or acid-washed, and has cut back about
60 percent on the amount of pumice it uses, supplementing the stone
with chemicals, said company spokesman David Samson in San Francisco.
   Although only a fraction of Copar's product ends up in the
industrial machines in which denim is stonewashed, opponents of the
mine have urged a boycott of stonewashed clothes.
   The East Fork Preservation Coalition and other environmental
groups also are pushing a proposal to have 115,000 acres, including
the mine site, designated as a National Recreation Area, which they
say would stop the patent process and offer greater protection for
the forest.
   There are efforts, too, to reform the 118-year-old mining law,
including two bills that have been introduced in Congress to revamp
it.
   The Copar mine is one of a series of disputes arising from the
law and an example of why it should be changed, said Philip Hocker,
president of the Mineral Policy Center in Washington, D.C.
   ``The law says that anybody who finds a valuable mineral deposit
in the public domain has a right to mine it, no matter what the
environmental consequences and with no payment to the public,'' he
said. ``That's what's wrong with it.''

<HEAD>Job Interview Crucial for Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hordes of high school and college graduates are
making the rounds of job interviews, and those face-to-face meetings
can be crucial to landing employment.
   A good-looking resume and thorough job application are a good
start, but those efforts lead to the interview, the make-or-break
moment in getting the job.
   Think of the man standing on a subway platform in New York
holding a violin case. He asks a conductor ``How do you get to
Carnegie Hall?''
   The conductor answers: ``Practice, practice, practice.''
   That's the case in job interviews, too.
   Consider beforehand what may be asked, practice questions and
answers with a friend, and don't get discouraged if it takes several
tries to land a job. Each interview is good practice for the next
one.
   Time is important in business, so the first thing to remember is
to be on time for the interview. Start out early and arrive a little
early if possible. And don't bring anyone along for moral support.
   Appearance is also important, say experts at the Labor
Department. The job interview is not a good time to express
individuality or eccentricity in dress or grooming.
   The clothing worn to an interview depends to some extent on the
job being applied for, but in all cases should be clean, neat and
conservative.
   Men, Labor Department officials say, should wear suits or shirts
and slacks. Dresses are best for women.
   Think in advance about how to answer some of the most likely
questions, such as why you want to work for that particular company,
what your interests and goals are and how you can help the company.
This requires learning something about the company beforehand,
either from library reading or by talking to people who work there.
   In answering questions, pause to compose an answer that is
concise and to the point. This requires careful listening to make
sure you understand the questions. And be sure to let the
interviewer finish the question. Don't interrupt.
   If you don't understand a question, ask the interviewer what he
or she means. Then answer honestly.
   Sometimes people will ask why you left a former job. Tell the
truth, but do not say negative things about former employers. Such
remarks may be interpreted as unwillingness on your part to
cooperate.
   Two of the hardest questions to deal with are the open-ended
ones, such as ``tell me about yourself'' and ``what can I do for
you?''
   The idea is to get you talking, and the best answer is to narrow
down the focus to the reasons why you are a good candidate for the
job in question.
   Don't just ramble on about yourself, describing long-term goals
or saying such things as ``I'd like to utilize my education'' or ``I
like to work with people.''
   Better is something more specific, such as ``I've always had an
interest in wholesale sales in the electronic industry and I have
studied marketing, which should help me in this job.''
   There are some questions employers are not supposed to ask unless
they pertain to the job, such as marital status, family planning and
child-care arrangements. Some will ask anyway, and it's probably
best to go ahead and answer.
   The focus in a first interview should be on the company and what
you can do for it, not on pay and fringe benefits. Information on
those things should be available from the personnel department. At
any rate, reserve the discussion of pay until a job offer is made.
   At the end of the interview, ask what the next step will be _
whether you should contact the company again or provide more
information, if the company will call you, and when a final decision
is likely to be made.
   Try to end on a positive note, repeating your interest in the job.
   After the interview, send a note to the interviewer, thanking him
or her for the time and providing any added information that may
have been requested.

<HEAD>Seattle Repertory Theater Seeks New Heights After Winning a Tony</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After the Tony, what?
   That is the happy question facing the Seattle Repertory Theater,
which is being presented the top award for a regional stage company
on Sunday night in New York.
   From the 27-year-old theater that first produced ``I'm Not
Rappaport,'' ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' ``Eastern Standard'' and
``Largely New York,'' the answer seems to be to try to do more of
the same and keep getting better.
   Major breakthroughs _ construction of a new playhouse in 1983,
production of award-winning new plays and formation of a resident
acting company _ came well before the theater awards were announced
on May 7.
   ``I think we could have won at any time in the last five years
and it would have been appropriate,'' said artistic director Daniel
Sullivan.
   ``A lot of people said that it was only a matter of time. Other
people said it was late in coming,'' said managing director Benjamin
Moore. ``It came as a surprise to me.''
   The Rep reached Tony caliber 10 years ago, said Peter Donnelly,
Moore's predecessor as top administrator of the Rep and now director
of Corporate Council for the Arts, a fund-raising group.
   ``The Tony, I think, is kind of an achievement award as opposed
to a `best of' kind of thing,'' Donnelly said.
   ``I think that it's certainly a nice imprimatur to have,''
Sullivan agreed. ``Our goals have been pretty high for the last few
years, and I don't think that's going to change because of the
Tony.''
   In the past 11 years, the Rep has developed more than 35 new
plays, several of which moved on to productions in New York and
London.
   Sullivan also has returned to acting after a 25-year hiatus in
addition to originating Herb Gardner's ``Rappaport'' and Wendy
Wasserstein's ``Heidi,'' which won Tonys in 1987 and 1989,
respectively.
   ``Heidi'' also won a Pulitzer Prize, and the Drama Desk and New
York Drama Critics awards. Sullivan was nominated for a Tony for
best director.
   The premiere of Lyle Kessler's ``Robbers'' last fall at the Rep
provided his latest role, Mr. Feathers, a seemingly mysterious
American Indian who hires an aimless, innocent young man into
private eye work to stop employee theft at a cannery.
   In a tragic, surreal and hilarious emotional roller coaster of a
plot, Feathers turns out to be white and cynical, and the young man
realizes he has betrayed his new lover and closest friend.
   ``I read plays as an actor,'' Sullivan said. ``I try to find
truth that I think an actor would find.''
   A top goal for the Rep now is to boost the number of actors in
the company from the current dozen to about 20, Moore said. ``We
also want to begin commissioning new work, not just soliciting new
scripts.''
   As a third goal, he said that within the next three to five years
he would like to see construction of a 275-seat house to complement
the 856-seat main stage in the Bagley Wright Theater at the Seattle
Center.
   With attendance at 90 percent of capacity or better for the past
decade, all three goals require more money than ticket sales can
provide _ and that's where the Tony is most valuable, Sullivan and
Moore said.
   For starters, the award carries a $25,000 grant from American
Express.
   ``I've been telling everyone, we like the recognition, but most
of all we like the money _ especially in these days of creeping
censorship from the (federal) government through restrictions on the
National Endowment for the Arts,'' Sullivan said. ``We like to get
money without strings attached.''
   The recognition also makes them more appealing to funding
sources, said Moore, managing director at the much larger American
Conservatory Theater in San Francisco for 15 years before moving to
the Rep in 1985.
   ``This is recognition that these theaters cannot achieve within
their own communities,'' he said. ``It's only when people hear from
professionals outside their own communities that suddenly their
stock goes up.''
   The awards, named for early 20th-century actress, producer and
director Antoinette Perry, have been awarded since 1947. The
regional award dates from 1976.
   Rather than starting as the vision of an artist, as is true with
most performing arts groups, the Rep was organized by local theater
fans after Century 21, the 1962 World's Fair.
   An initial attempt to form an actors company quickly collapsed,
but by 1979 the Rep had a yearly budget exceeding $2.3 million,
141,948 ticket buyers who filled the Seattle Center Playhouse to 95
percent of capacity and 21,880 subscribers.
   Years of artistic doldrums also were ending with the arrival of
Sullivan as resident director under the late John Hirsch, acting
artistic director.
   By the time Hirsch left to take the artistic reins of the
Shakespeare festival in Stratford, Ontario, Sullivan was well into
his new-play program.
   ``I just came here and decided to do it,'' Sullivan said. ``The
new work ... that's something I can't do without.''
   The Bagley Wright was completed in 1983, and Moore arrived two
years later to help Sullivan provide the final ingredient,
successful formation of a resident company of actors.
   ``The artists were mere guests in this building,'' Sullivan said.
   ``It was not a very good home for the actor,'' Moore said. ``This
theater was still jobbing in actors almost on a show-by-show basis.''

   Most producers make television shows to win
rating points. Marian Rees aims to win hearts and minds.
   Rees' productions include 1985's ``Love is Never Silent,'' the
Emmy-winning story of deaf parents and their hearing daughter, and
this year's ``A Son's Promise,'' the well-received account of a
young man's pledge to raise his orphaned brothers.
   Throughout her career, Rees has fought to deliver programs that
have often run contrary to television's lowest-common-denominator
formulas. For her efforts, she is now considered one of the most
successful and acclaimed women in television.
   ``I really quarrel with the assumption that good programming is
bad business,'' Rees said in an interview. ``People are turning away
(from the networks) not because it's bad business. They're turning
away because it's bad programming.''
   At Marian Rees Associates Inc., an independent production
company, Rees has formed an alliance with ``Hallmark Hall of Fame.''
Collaborations with the greeting card company have yielded ``The
Marva Collins Story,'' ``The Room Upstairs,'' ``Resting Place,''
``Love is Never Silent,'' ``Foxfire,'' ``Home Fires Burning'' and
``The Shell Seekers.''
   The company also has production deals with all three networks, as
well as PBS and cable's Home Box Office and TNT. Since the company
was established in 1981, Marian Rees Associates has made 13 movies
for television and has nine movies in various stages of development.
   A volunteer for the Center for Population Options and Alternative
Living for the Aging, Rees said her work reflects several concerns.
   ``My own personal goals _ and the reason I started the company _
was to be able to do the things I had a strong, strong commitment
to,'' she said. ``Most of our works try to have a spin to them on an
issue. And I've also begun to realize that they all turn around
family.''
   She studied sociology, psychology and religion at the University
of Iowa. Her first job in television was as an NBC receptionist.
   Rees served as the associate producer on the pilots of two of
television's longest-running series, ``All in the Family'' and
``Sanford and Son.'' At Norman Lear's Tandem Productions, she worked
on ``The Thief Who Came to Dinner,'' ``The Night They Raided
Minsky's'' and ``Duke Ellington...We Love You Madly.'' Subsequent
credits included ``Can You Hear the Laughter?'' about Freddie Prinze
and ``Angel Dusted'' with Jean Stapleton.
   Rees knows television still has a lot of room for improvement.
   ``Children's programming is one of the shames of our industry,''
she said. ``The whole issue of selling through children's
programming is abhorrent.''
   Rees said a recent television movie about the Laker Girls was
``outright exploitation,'' and she was glad the show fared poorly in
the ratings.
   Rees is the president of Women in Film, an organization whose
future, she hopes, is not long.
   ``Until there is the evidence of equal opportunity and equal pay,
then our hope is that there will be no need for Women in Film at
all,'' she said. ``The day we celebrate its dissolution is a day we
look forward to.''

<HEAD>Jaguar Vanden Plas: Refinements in '90 Include Engine</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Status and a refined ride come standard with the 1990 Jaguar
Vanden Plas sedan. So does a sense of accomplishment.
   The Vanden Plas is, after all, the top of Jaguar's standard
production line for the United States. And if the car's $48,000
price tag doesn't show that you've arrived, the Jaguar's sleek body
lines and soothing, quiet interior will.
   This is, indeed, a car that's meant as a reward.
   That's why so many buyers are well-heeled chief executives and
business owners. Jaguar spokesman Mike Cook said buyers are
typically in their mid to upper 40s and are highly educated. Nearly
half are women, and average annual income of Vanden Plas purchasers
is more than $200,000.
   The car comes with a host of standard features, including
sunroof, a leather interior that uses no less than seven animal
hides, and polished burl walnut on the dashboard, doors and the
front seat-backs.
   The Vanden Plas comes with fuzzy synthetic mats over the regular
floor mats for added softness and comfort, a premium sound system,
automatic leveling suspension and a 271-page owner's manual.
   Jaguar has increased its fuel-injected, six-cylinder engine from
3.6 liters to 4, boosting output by 12 percent to 223 horsepower.
The result is 0-60 mph acceleration in less than 9 seconds.
   The gearshift features a sport setting that allows the driver to
change the transmission's shift points for added pickup. But even
that won't do terrible damage to fuel economy. During the test
drive, I averaged close to 20 miles per gallon in mixed city-highway
driving using the sport and regular settings intermittently.
   Front seats were comfortable for me, with electronic adjustments
and lumbar support for individual setting. But a friend who has
thicker hips and legs found the driver seat a bit confining. His
right leg bumped against the parking brake lever situated to the
left of the center console, next to the driver seat.
   Rear legroom was admirable, even with the front seats pushed all
the way back. But the middle passenger must sit on a rather stiff
seat area _ it has a storage bin underneath the seat leather _ and
headroom isn't the greatest, either. The back seat is much better
suited for only two passengers.
   The trunk was low, with 12.7 cubic feet of usable space once the
big spare tire was in there. Fit and finish, as expected, was
excellent inside and out.
   Jaguar has seen its U.S. car sales fall off since 1986, when
sales hit 24,464. They fell to 22,919 in 1987 as the company lost
production during its changeover to a new-model XJ-6, Cook said. He
attributed the continued sales slide _ to 20,727 in 1988 and 18,967
in 1989 _ to a soft luxury market in the United States.
   The company hopes to push unit sales beyond 20,000 again this
year. Competitors in the luxury sedan class include the Lexus LS400,
which starts at $35,000; the Infiniti Q45, at $38,000; BMW 735i,
nearly $50,000; and the Mercedes-Benz 300 series, which starts at
just under $40,000.
   Consumer Reports magazine ranks 1984-88 Jaguar XJ-6 models as
much worse than average in owner complaints of trouble. Cook
acknowledged that early 1988 models had some problems but said
corrections have been made.

   Orders to U.S. factories slumped 2.3 percent in
April, helping to push orders down 2 percent for the year, the
government said in a report providing more evidence of a slow
manufacturing economy.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday orders to factories totaled
a seasonally adjusted $235.6 billion. That followed gains of 4
percent in March and 1.8 percent in February.
   Despite the gains, the April decline and a 5.5 percent drop in
January means factory orders have fallen 2 percent in the year's
first four months.

   Lower prices and higher consumer incomes made
it easier for the typical American family to buy an existing
single-family home in April, a real estate trade group said.
   The National Association of Realtors said Thursday its housing
affordability index reached 104.6 in April, up from 103.9 in March.
   That means a family earning the median income of $34,032 had
104.6 percent of the income needed to qualify for conventional
financing covering 80 percent of a median-priced home costing
$95,300.

<HEAD>Ex-Partner Links Mulheren To Boesky Scheme</HEAD>

   John A. Mulheren Jr. kept his firm's stock
holdings in Unocal Corp. off of profit and loss statements because
the shares really belonged to Ivan Boesky, a former partner of
Mulheren said in federal court.
   The testimony Thursday by Edward McCarthy, once a partner in
Jamie Securities Co., appeared to directly link Mulheren to what the
governmnent charges was an illegal trading scheme to help Boesky
cheat on taxes and skirt federal laws.
   Also, Boesky's former chief trader told a federal judge he
regularly takes a drug used to control anxiety or tension. The
trader, a government witness, made the admission at the request of
defense lawyers who claimed the drug could affect memory.
   Testifying under immunity from prosecution, McCarthy said
Mulheren in 1985 asked him to separate trading in Unocal from the
firm's profit and loss statements because the holdings belonged to
Boesky.
   He also said the firm temporarily held four large securities
positions for Boesky in 1985 because Boesky needed money to comply
with federal net capital laws.
   The government's charges against Mulheren include manipulating a
stock price and ``parking'' securities to help Boesky.
   The government claims Mulheren bought $10 million in Unocal
shares from Boesky in mid-1985 with an agreement to sell back the
stock at a later date. The ``parking'' arrangement allegedly was
designed to help Boesky create the appearance of losses for tax
purposes.
   In addition, Mulheren is accused of holding large options
positions in four companies to help Boesky temporarily raise money
to meet federal laws governing the amount of capital a securities
firm must hold.
   The trial has attracted widespread attention because it marked
the first time Boesky has testified publicly since he settled
insider trading charges 3{ years ago.
   Boesky was once Wall Street's best-known speculator and his
cooperation with investigators has led to numerous prosecutions. He
took the stand last week to implicate Mulheren, a former friend and
associate.
   McCarthy, 39, of Freehold, N.J., said Mulheren in the late summer
or early fall of 1985 asked him whether Jamie had the buying power
to purchase the options because Boesky had ``problems'' with his
capital.
   McCarthy said Mulheren later told him and another partner that
``Boesky wanted his money back'' from trading profits Jamie made in
the deal. Previous testimony by Michael Davidoff, Boesky's former
chief trader, placed the amount at around $2 million.
   McCarthy said that when he suggested writing Boesky a check,
Mulheren laughed and then devised a scheme under which Boesky's
Seemala Corp. would inflate brokerage fee bills to pay back the
money.
   Mulheren, 40, is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy, securities
and mail fraud, and record-keeping violations.
   Also Thursday, Davidoff said in a closed-door hearing before U.S.
District Judge Miriam Goldman Cederbaum that he has taken a drug for
four or five years to control high blood pressure and nervousness.
   Defense lawyers said they wanted to find out whether Davidoff was
on medication because it may have affected his recollection of
events. Mulheren attorney Thomas Puccio said a doctor told him the
drug, Ativan, could affect memory, and that the issue would be
raised Monday before Cederbaum.
   The government sought to prevent disclosure, apparently out of
fear it could tarnish Davidoff's testimony.
   According to the Physicians' Desk Reference, Ativan is a brand
name for the drug lorazepam. It is taken for ``the management of
anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of
anxiety or anxiousness associated with depressive symptoms,'' the
text says.
   Davidoff previously testified about the alleged Unocal and
options parking transactions. He has pleaded guilty to one felony
count, agreed to cooperate with the government and is awaiting
sentencing.

<HEAD>U.S., Trading Partners Want Cuts in Farm Payments, But Differ on
Approach</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An impasse between the United States and its
European trading partners over cutting farm subsidies threatens to
block a four-year effort to liberalize the global trading system,
government officials said.
   The warnings came at the end of a two-day meeting of trade and
finance officials from two dozen industrialized nations.
   Officials had hoped the meeting would generate fresh momentum in
the trade talks. But instead they ended on a discordant note as the
European Community refused to accept U.S. demands to sharply curtail
its farm supports and export subsidies.
   The trading bloc's argument is ``simply not a tenable long-term
position,'' said Gareth Evans, Australia's foreign affairs minister.
   ``They will be putting at risk not just agriculture but the whole
round (of trade negotiations) if they stick to a position as tight
as that,'' he said.
   Ministers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development ended their talks Thursday by saying they agreed ``to
take urgent steps to reform agricultural policy, as regards support
and protection, so as to permit greater liberalization of trade.''
   But in an unusual move, their closing statement acknowledged
differences ``on how an approach to these objectives should be
expressed at this stage.''
   ``It was better to express these differences of views publicly
than to try to paper them over,'' said OECD Secretary-General
Jean-Claude Paye.
   Some 100 nations have been attempting to forge a new agreement to
reduce trade barriers in 15 areas, including agriculture, textiles
and services. The talks began in Uruguay in 1986 and are scheduled
to end in December.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills had wanted this week's OECD
meeting to give a push to the trade talks. But the talks appeared to
do little more than show how far apart the two sides are.
   At the heart of the fight is an American demand that the
12-nation EC do much more to rein in government spending on farm
subsidies, in particular by moving to eliminate costly export
subsidies.
   But Ray MacSharry, the trading bloc's top farm official, said,
``That is politically impossible and will not happen.''
   He contended that getting rid of the program would translate into
higher farm prices in Europe and cost the jobs of millions of
farmers.
   The subsidies allows expensive European farm products to compete
with lower prices on the world market.
   The United States complains the subsidies have enabled the
community to increase its share of the world market and has
responded by setting up its own export subsidy program.
   American officials also pressed the community to open its markets
wider to foreign farm products and reduce farm payments that
encourage overproduction of crops.
   The community rebuffed the pressure. It called instead for an
attempt to lower farm payments by first measuring a country's trade
performance in agriculture.
   The ministers did promise to ``to make every effort to overcome
the differences'' by a July 23 bargaining session in Geneva. By
then, the United States wants preliminary agreements or negotiating
texts in all 15 areas under discussion.
   The Uruguay Round of trade talks is being held under the auspices
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and agreement
for promoting freer trade.
   OECD members are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United States and West Germany.

<HEAD>Drivers' Union Floats Idea Of Employee Buyout To Save Greyhound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If an employee buyout can solve an airline's woes,
striking Greyhound drivers think the same strategy could rescue the
only nationwide bus company from the brink of bankruptcy.
   A financial advisor hired by the drivers has asked to meet with
Greyhound Lines Inc. to discuss a possible employee buyout.
   The advisor, Brian Freeman, isn't new to the idea. He is advising
UAL Corp. employees on their effort to complete a proposed $4.54
billion buyout of the parent of United Airlines.
   In a letter dated May 29 to Greyhound management and creditors,
Freeman said he believed ``100 percent employee ownership of all
transportation operating and related assets, together with a
significant creditor restructuring'' is the best solution to the
company's troubles.
   Freeman said Thursday a price for a Greyhound buyout had not been
determined and no financing had been arranged, although he said
money ``should be available.''
   He said the union also is willing to discuss other alternatives.
   ``Within the short-term, I intend to make a specific proposal,
and begin to press aggressively toward a resolution,'' Freeman wrote
on behalf of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions.
   ``Please advise me immediately whether you wish to explore mutual
problem solving. Otherwise I will proceed on my own,'' Freeman
wrote. ``I intend to place my client in a position so that, either
cooperatively or independently, it can make a specific proposal and
press forward within the next several weeks.''
   Greyhound's initial response wasn't positive.
   ``We are surprised the group that has brought about the company's
current financial crisis through an unprecedented wave of violence
now proposes to profit from its own criminal activity by buying the
company,'' said executive vice president P. Anthony Lannie.
   Greyhound has reported more than two dozen incidents of violence
since its drivers went on strike on March 2.
   The company has been operating reduced schedules since the strike
began, using newly hired drivers and about 500 union members who
crossed picket lines.
   Although the company claims the strike is ``irrelevant'' because
it has enough drivers to operate, the strike has drained its cash
and left it in danger of having to file for bankruptcy protection.
   Greyhound already has missed more than $14 million in interest
and lease payments since the end of April and faces an additional
$2.5 million payment on Friday.
   Unless those payments are met soon, creditors could force the
company into involuntary bankruptcy, although Greyhound likely would
file for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws before that happened.
   The company's debt is the legacy of a leveraged buyout three
years ago led by Chairman Fred G. Currey that took the company
private.
   Currey and other investors paid $270 million for the bus
operations of Greyhound Corp., since renamed Greyhound Dial Corp. A
few months they paid an additional $80 million for Dallas-based
Trailways Lines Inc., then the nation's largest operator of
Trailways buses.
   Greyhound has proposed to repurchase most of its $225 million in
junk bond debt at a steep discount to enable the company to avoid
bankruptcy.
   The repurchase is tied to Greyhound obtaining as much as $150
million in new financing, however, a task some analysts doubt can be
accomplished in light of Greyhound's labor troubles and the state of
the financial markets.
   Further clouding Greyhound's future is a finding by the National
Labor Relations Board that the company engaged in unfair labor
practices by implementing its contract proposal immediately after
the strike began.
   An administrative law judge will hear arguments in the case in
Milwaukee on Sept. 17, beginning a process that could take years to
end, and result in the bus company being forced to pay about $10
million a month in back wages.
   Greyhound says it is confident it will win once the case gets in
court.

<HEAD>Greenwald Gets Cautious Thumbs Up On Wall Street</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. stock soared after former Chrysler Vice
Chairman Gerald Greenwald was chosen to head an employee buyout of
United Airlines' parent, but analysts suggested that his appointment
alone won't seal the deal.
   ``While he has a good record on financial matters, the airline
industry is unique,'' Robert Joedicke, an airline specialist for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, said Thursday.
   Joedicke said bankers who must finance the deal will want to see
a chief operating officer with a strong knowledge of the airline
business.
   ``The key requirement it that there is someone there that
understands how to run an airline,'' he said.
   Greenwald acknowledged as much at a news conference in Highland
Park, Mich. He said one of his first tasks would be to seek someone
from the airline industry as second in command.
   Bankers are familar with Greenwald himself. He played major roles
in securing federal government loans that saved Chrysler from
bankruptcy in 1979, and in negotiating the purchase of American
Motors Corp. in 1987.
   On Thursday, the price of UAL stock surged $4.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange to $155.62{.
   Still, that was well below the $201 offer made by the United
Employees Acquisition Corp., which indicates that some investors
remain skeptical that the deal will come off, Joedicke said.
   Other analysts said caution prevails given the employees' failure
to raise financing for a $300-a-share buyout offer last October.
That triggered a massive 190-point freefall in the Dow Jones
industrial average.
   Greenwald, vice chairman of Chrysler since November 1988, will
become chief executive officer of the buyout corporation, an entity
formed by the airline's three major unions.
   If the acquisition attempt is successful, Greenwald, 54, will
become chairman and chief executive officer of Chicago-based UAL
Corp. and United Airlines. He would replace UAL Chairman Stephen
Wolf, who has been targeted for ouster by the unions.
   UAL spokesman Tony Molinaro said Wolf would have no comment on
his fate.
   In a statement, Wolf said, ``I congratulate our union leaders for
recruiting someone of Jerry Greenwald's stature. As he proceeds to
finance the transaction, I will be as helpful to him as possible.''
   Greenwald said he began seriously considering joining the UAL
buyout effort 10 days ago, about five weeks after he was first
contacted by the group.
   ``The offer kept getting more tempting,'' he said. ``At one
point, I wasn't at all clear who was going to be running the
company. My mind changed from it being a problem to being an
opportunity about 10 days ago.''
   The offer by the buyout group _ the Air Line Pilots Assocation,
the Machinists union and the Association of Flight Attendants _ is
made up of $155 in cash, $35 in high-yield notes and $11 a share
from UAL's 51 percent stake in Covia, the company's computer
reservation system.
   The UAL board has given the buyout group until Aug. 9 to come up
with the financing.

   Chrysler Corp. wasted little time in tapping a
successor to former Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald by moving Chief
Financial Officer Robert S. Miller one step closer to the chairman's
office.
   Miller, 48, was named vice chairman of the nation's No. 3
automaker Thursday afternoon, less than 24 hours after Greenwald's
resignation was announced.
   The latest moves in the executive suite of Chrysler's Highland
Park headquarters come as the company is fighting to hold its
declining market share in the face of tough domestic and overseas
competition.
   Greenwald, who was heir apparent to Chrysler Chairman Lee
Iacocca, quit Wednesday to head up a three-union bid to buy United
Airlines parent company for $4.54 billion.
   In the management shuffle, Chrysler obliterated the Office of the
Chairman, an indication that Iacocca may be reasserting himself in
corporate operations.
   Iacocca's contract expires at the end of 1991. A year ago, he
said he was reducing his day-to-day input into Chrysler's car and
truck making operations. But at the company's annual meeting in Los
Angeles last month, the colorful, 65-year-old Iacocca hedged on
whether he would retire next year.
   ``I've got to think that Iacocca has got to come out and stay
beyond '91,'' auto analyst John Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. said
Thursday.
   Before the announcement of Miller's rise, he and Chrysler Motors
President Robert Lutz were seen as likely successors to Greenwald.
   Miller has focused on the company's financial operations while
Lutz has concentrated on product development.
   After the announcement, Miller consolidated his hold on
Chrysler's financial operations by assuming Greenwald's duties of
overseeing Chrysler Financial Corp., Chrysler Technologies and the
company's international operations.
   Meantime, Lutz took over Greenwald's chores of supervising
Acustar, Chrysler's parts subsidiary, and the Office of Quality and
Productivity, both product-oriented.
   Miller, Lutz and Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell each
will report to Iacocca. Bidwell, 62, reportedly has been working a
light schedule lately and may take early retirement.
   Greenwald and Miller shared much of the responsibility of helping
put together a series of federally guaranteed loans to rescue
Chrysler from a brush with bankruptcy in the late 1970s and early
1980s.
   Miller now faces more tough financial work as Chrysler wrestles
with sagging profits in a weak car and truck market.
   Chrysler's first-quarter earnings dropped 80 percent to $71
million from year-ago levels. The company's car and truck market
share as of the end of April stood at 12.4 percent, down nearly 2
percentage points from a year earlier.
   Analysts said the drop in profits was less than they expected.
But they predicted that an interruption of production of Chrysler's
highly profitable minivans this summer could put the company in the
red for the third quarter.
   Also later this year, Chrysler is due to wind up a cost-cutting
program designed to trim $1.5 billion from annual expenses and
negotiate a new contract with the United Auto Workers.
   All are formidable chores for an automaker executive.
   Greenwald said his first task will be to put together financing
to pay for the unions' United buyout bid by Aug. 9.
   Although Greenwald said the main reason he decided to quit was to
take on the United challenge, analysts and others have wondered if
he was getting tired of waiting for Iacocca to retire.
   ``I think he recognizes that Lee is probably going to be around
for an extended period of time,'' said auto analyst Joseph Phillippi
of Shearson Lehman Hutton of New York. ``Even if Lee were to become
chairman only and Jerry were to become CEO, he's still going to have
the old boss looking over his shoulder.
   ``That may have bothered him a lot.''

<HEAD>Amarillo Businessman Comes To Defense Of City After Pickens
Criticism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   T. Boone Pickens doesn't think much of his old home
town and has predicted a dire future for Amarillo, but a local
businessman has challenged the oilman to back up his words with a
$100,000.
   In a letter that became public in Amarillo this week, Pickens
said the Panhandle city is headed for a ``steady, rapid, downhill
slide,'' and said the population would dip below 100,000 by 2000, a
drop of nearly 40 percent.
   ``I sure do like this town, and I don't like anybody taking shots
at it,'' said Jerry Hodge, who described himself as friends with
Pickens.
   The city has been struggling since the mid-1980s because of the
collapse of the energy industry.
   Pickens left Amarillo last year as both he and some top
executives of his Mesa Limited Partnership moved to Dallas.
   The departure came after years of feuding with the city's
newspaper and officials. Shortly before he left, voters defeated all
candidates for the Amarillo City Commission perceived as being
backed by Pickens.
   Although Pickens never gave a clear reason for leaving Amarillo,
in a letter last month to a friend who was moving back to the town,
he said: ``I know that there were better places to live than
Amarillo. ... Probably the biggest problem the town has is no
leadership.''
   ``The city has now moved basically to a blue-collar district,''
Pickens said in the letter, which became public this week in
Amarillo and was a hot topic on local television news.
   Pickens said he agreed with a former associate's description of
the town as a ``truck stop. ... I think within 10 years, the town
will have less than 100,000 people.''
   The Panhandle city's current population is estimated at 160,422.
   Hodge, a former city commissioner and mayor, challenged Pickens
to mach his purchase of a $100,000 certificate of deposit, with the
winner receiving both CDs, plus 10 years of interest, in the year
2000.
   ``The loser will present his money at a dinner prepared by the
blue collar workers of Amarillo or by Dallas white collar
executives, whichever the case may be,'' Hodge said.
   Pickens' associates were angry that the letter between friends
had become public, and spokesman Ralph Whitworth dismissed Hodge's
offer as a publicity ploy.
   ``If he's got a $100,000, let him give it to economic development
instead of PR stunts,'' Whitworth said, noting that Mesa retains a
400-person work force in Amarillo with a $20 million payroll.
   Although there have been several major layoffs in the last couple
of years, other companies have expanded and the unemployment rate
has dropped from 6.7 percent in 1986 to about 5 percent currently,
said Steve Ahlenius, director of business development and public
affairs for the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce.

<HEAD>Nine Settle SEC Civil Charges in Alleged Tipping Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former chairman of modular structures
company and the wife of the company's ex-president have settled
federal securities charges that they tipping off seven friends and
relatives to a pending acquisition.
   The pair, as well as the people they allegedly tipped to
confidential corporate information, settled the civil charges
Thursday _ the same day they were brought by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in San Francisco.
   In all, the defendants will pay a total of $330,000 in penalties
and restitution to settle securities fraud charges, without
admitting or denying wrongdoing, the SEC announced in Washington.
   According to the SEC, Modulaire Industries agreed to be acquired
by Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill., in May 1987 for $16 a
share. At the time, the company's stock was trading for about $7 a
share.
   Three days before Modulaire's acceptance of the offer was made
public, according to the SEC complaint, then-chairman Joseph Behar
tipped off a friend, who bought 5,400 shares with the alleged
illegal inside information.
   The SEC also charged that Adrienne Wailes, wife of Modulaire's
then-president, David Wailes, tipped off several friends and
relatives, including the couple's adult son, Deven. David Wailes was
not accused of any wrongdoing.
   Aside from noting that his client had not admitted any
wrongdoing, Behar's attorney in San Francisco, Curt Mueller,
declined comment.
   Mrs. Wailes' attorney was not in his office when called for
comment.
   The people tipped by Behar and Mrs. Wailes bought between 750 and
4,300 shares apiece of Modulaire stock before the public
announcement of the acquisition drove the stock price up to $15 a
share, the SEC said.
   Two of the buyers _ including Deven Wailes _ canceled their stock
purchases before they were completed and did not have to pay any
financial penalties.

<HEAD>Study Finds Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae Vulnerable to Economic Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government-sponsored enterprises that help
finance a fourth of the nation's single-family homes are vulnerable
to an economic downturn, according to a Bush administration study.
   Three trends during the 1980s have so far insulated Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac from a slowdown in the economy, said the 480-page
study released Thursday.
   These are rapid inflation of housing prices, an ample supply of
first-time home buyers from the Baby Boom generation and fast growth
in the packaging of mortgages into securities.
   However, all three trends are ending, the study said, noting that
for Fannie Mae the ``biggest credit risk is a regional or national
economic slowdown.''
   Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and
Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.) are
congressionally chartered but privately owned enterprises. Together,
they help finance one of every four single-family home sales by
purchasing mortgages, holding some and repackaging most into
securities for resale to investors.
   Because they were created by Congress and dominate so much of the
housing market, the agencies are perceived as having the
government's implicit guarantee against default.
   Last year's savings and loan bailout bill passed by Congress
ordered the Treasury Department to evaluate the risks posed to
taxpayers from a default by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and seven other
similar government-sponsored enterprises that back loans to
home-buyers, students and farmers.
   The Treasury forwarded its recommendations for improving federal
oversight of the enterprises to Congress two weeks ago, but
Thursday's report provided the first look at the Bush
administration's evaluation of individual organizations.
   ``None of the (government-sponsored enterprises) are in imminent
danger, but obviously some are stronger and some are weaker,''
Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber said.
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac account for about three-quarters of
the enterprises' $863 billion in debt outstanding at the end of last
year.
   In general, Freddie Mac received the more favorable evaluation.
The report said Fannie Mae needed a bigger cushion of capital from
its shareholders to insulate taxpayers from risk.
   Nevertheless, the report said it had concerns in the long run
with Freddie Mac because its capital standard does not discourage
risk-taking.
   It said Fannie Mae was more vulnerable to swings in interest
rates and that a change of 4 or 5 percentage points could wipe out
Fannie Mae's net worth if it were forced to mark its holdings to
market value.
   Fannie Mae holds more mortgages in its investment portfolio than
Freddie Mac. It finances its holdings with borrowed money, so its
costs rise if interest rates go up. Higher rates also tend to deter
homebuyers and dampen house prices.
   Both enterprises maintain they are well-positioned to withstand
an economic downturn, but the Treasury criticized the ``stress
tests'' the two devised. It said the tests, intended to show how the
enterprises would fare during a recession, depend too heavily on
statistical assumptions that may not prove true.
   The Treasury also noted that Fannie Mae has concentrated slightly
more than half of its activity in just five states _ California, New
York, Florida, New Jersey and Texas.
   David Jeffers, Fannie Mae vice president, said his organization
has already launched a program to bolster its capital, but he
rejected the notion that it needed to change its operations
radically. He said Fannie Mae was well-diversified geographically.
   ``We have demonstrated our ability to manage (our) business in a
prudent and profitable way. We don't see any need to change the
course we're on,'' he said.
   Freddie Mac President Leland Brendsel said in a statement: ``Our
capital base will remain strong in the long run.''
   The other enterprises included in the study are the Federal Home
Loan Bank System, Farm Credit Banks, Banks for Cooperatives, Farm
Credit System Financial Assistance Corp., Federal Agricultural
Mortgage Association (Farmer Mac), Student Loan Marketing
Association (Sallie Mae) and College Construction Loan Insurance
Association (Connie Lee).
   In its previous suggestions for reform, the Treasury Department
called for raising more private capital to back the enterprises,
requiring the enterprises to obtain a triple-A rating from private
credit-rating agencies and designating a separate federal office to
monitor the safety and soundness of the enterprises.

   The U.S. dollar finished higher in Tokyo today,
while stock prices fell in moderate trading on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 152.17 yen in quiet trading, up 0.42 yen
from Thursday's close. The U.S. currency opened higher following
overnight strength in New York, where it was bought on the
expectation the U.S. unemployment rate for May would decline,
dealers said.
   But most market players in Tokyo chose to wait for the figures.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues fell 239.68 points, or 0.72 percent, ending the week at
32,891.12 points. The index had gained 204.54 points the previous
day.
   A total of 700 million shares changed hands on the market's first
section, down from Thursday's 800 million.
   Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co., said the
Nikkei's decline resulted from arbitrage selling of spot issues to
profit from the price gap between the spot and futures markets.

   Agriculture Department economists say prices
farmers get for raw products increased 2 percent from April to May,
raising the overall commodity index 3.4 percent above a year ago.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Thursday in
its preliminary report the increase resulted primarily from higher
prices for hogs, corn, hay, broilers and lettuce.
   Hog prices averaged $60.50 per hundred pounds of live weight, a
level topped only by the record of $62.10 in August 1986.
   USDA reported lower prices for eggs, onions, milk and cattle.
   Although prices for beef cattle posted a slight decline, calves
averaged higher. Also up from April levels were sorghum and soybean
prices. There were slight drops in prices for barley, wheat and rice.
   The May price index for livestock and poultry rose 1.2 percent
from April and averaged 10 percent above the level of a year ago.
   Overall crop prices went up 3.1 percent from April but averaged
4.9 percent below the year-earlier level. Fruit prices fueled by
oranges and grapefruits were up 3.6 percent from last month, about
the same as a year ago.
   Commercial vegetables were up 3.4 percent from the April level
but were down 21 percent below a year earlier. Lettuce and tomatoes
were up while carrots and onions were down.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $74.30 per hundred pounds of live weight
nationally, down from $74.60 in April but up from $68.80 in May
1989. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $60.50 per hundred pounds, compared with $53.80 in
April and $41.60 in May 1989.
   _Corn, at $2.66 a bushel, was up from $2.51 in April and $2.58
from the level of a year ago.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.44 a bushel, compared with $3.49 in April and $4.01 a
year ago.
   _Rice averaged $7.21 per hundred pounds, compared with $7.31 in
April and $6.78 in May 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.92 per bushel, compared with $5.82 last month
and $7.20 in May 1989.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 66.3 cents per pound, up from 65
cents in April and 58.3 cents a year ago.
   _Eggs were 60.2 cents a dozen, compared with 71.4 cents a dozen
in April and 62.6 cents a year ago.
   _Milk was $13.20 per 100 pounds compared with $13.40 in April and
$12.30 at the year-earlier level.
   _Broilers were 35.2 cents per pound compared with 33.2 cents in
April and 44.6 cents a year ago.

   USDA officials say recent tests show consumers
run little health risk from drug, chemical and pesticide residues in
meat and poultry.
   ``The residue rates are the lowest they've been in years,''
Richard L. Carnevale, assistant deputy administrator of USDA's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, told a news briefing Thursday.
   At the session, he released latest results of tests performed on
cattle, calves, swine, goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, ducks and
other animals.
   USDA officials acknowledged an increase in concern among
consumers over residues of pesticides, other farm chemicals such as
fertilizers and drugs in the food they purchase for their tables.
   Such residues are found when drugs such as antibiotics and sulfa
have been administered improperly and when the animals have eaten
feed that was sprayed with chemicals.
   Carnevale said, however, that pesticide and chemical residues
were not shown to exist in illegal levels in the most recent tests
and that only a few problems were found with drug residues.
   Illegal levels of residues were found in only 0.3 percent of the
41,505 samples tested in the agency's routine monitoring last year,
he said.
   The Food Safety and Inspection Service conducts three types of
residue testing programs. Carnevale said the routine monitoring
system ``provides us with the most meaningful residue statistics.''
   Young veal calves were one area of concern, he said. He said
producers and other custodians of the ``bob veal'' calves are being
required to sign statements concerning the administration of drugs
before slaughter.
   Tests also showed high levels of sulfa residues in cull dairy
cows _ ones that are no longer producing milk and are on their way
to slaughter, Carnevale said. He said dairy producers were being
notified to step up controls.

   The Agriculture Department announced it has
quarantined 81 square miles of Dade County, Fla., following the
discovery of 19 Mediterranean fruit flies in the Miami area.
   ``Our quarantine is designed to prevent the spread of Medfly,''
said James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service.
   The action Thursday followed a request last week by Florida
Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner to the department to
quarantine the entire state of California for combat a Medfly
outbreak.
   The department confirmed that it has no plans to expand its
current quarantine of parts of southern California.
   The fly attacks more than 200 varieties of fruits and vegetables.
Citrus is especially vulnerable, with losses of 25 percent to 50
percent of production likely in cases of severe infestation.
   ``We feel our quarantine procedure and the area that is
quarantined are adequate at this point to prevent the spread of
Medflies,'' said spokesman Larry Mark.
   He said the decision not to expand the quarantine was made
Wednesday after the National Plant Board Advisory Council, meeting
here, recommended no change for at least 30 days.

   An official of the International Monetary Fund
is laying out stiff conditions for an effective shift from communism
to a market economy in eastern Europe.
   Thomas A. Wolf, senior economist in the fund's European
Department, spoke Thursday at a forum unrelated to the U.S.-Soviet
summit meeting. By coincidence he outlined his ideas just after
President Mikhail Gorbachev, at the Soviet embassy a few blocks
away, made a plea to Americans to let the Soviets find their own way
toward a system run on market principles.
   The Bush administration has opposed the Soviet Union joining the
152 members of the IMF and its sister organization, the World Bank.
Present members include Poland, Hungary and Romania. Officials
elsewhere in Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, have said
they want to join, too.
   Wolf listed five areas in which he said comprehensive reforms are
needed in Eastern Europe. He did not specify any country.
   ``Without action in each of these five areas, a market-oriented
reform will not be comprehensive and therefore is bound not to meet
objectives of the reformers,'' he said.
   Wolf said Eastern European countries should:
   _Eliminate much of the economic bureaucracy and let enterprises
make their own decisions on matters such as prices, wages,
employment, investment, output and foreign trade. One way to do that
is to make profit the main motivation for managers, he said, and
another is to clearly define property rights.
   _Initiate price reforms, either by changing the government-fixed
prices to bring them close to the balance between supply and demand,
or by freeing prices entirely from government control, or anything
in between.
   _Make wages depend on how much workers produce.
   _Change the system of foreign trade, including the buying and
selling of foreign currencies.
   _Create a new system of government influence on the economy:
since the state will no longer control enterprises directly, it must
influence them indirectly through taxes, official spending and
monetary policy, as Western governments now do.
   ``It's not enough to give enterprises greater autonomy or greater
authority,'' Wolf said. ``They need to be given incentives to use
the authority that they are suddenly given.
   ``But giving enterprises greater authority and greater incentive
is still not enough,'' he said.
   ``They have to be given the responsibility to act through the
market in order to raise or maximize profits and to raise wages _ in
other words, not to have the possibility of achieving those goals of
higher profits and wages by negotiating special deals with the
economic bureaucracy.''

<HEAD>China Orders Boeing Jets in Deal Worth Up to $4 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's Civil Aviation Administration has ordered
36 Boeing jetliners and taken options on 36 more in a deal that
could be worth up to $4 billion, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
said.
   The order, announced Thursday, includes five 747-400 jumbo jets;
one 747-200F, a jumbo freighter; four widebody 767s; 13 midsized
757s; and 13 737-300s, a smaller twinjet. Three of the 757s were
announced late last year.
   The firm orders are worth about $2 billion, Boeing spokesman John
Wheeler said, but the options, which include nearly the same types
of airplanes, could bring the total package to $4 billion.
   Deliveries will start in 1992 and extend into the late 1990s,
Wheeler said.
   The Civil Aviation Administration oversees the purchase of
aircraft for China's airlines. The new jetliners will be used by Air
China, Guangzhou CAAC, China Southwest Airlines and others, Boeing
said.
   Attending a signing ceremony in Renton, Wash., were Hu Yizhou,
director general of CAAC; Zhu Qizhen, China's ambassador to the
United States, and Liu Yuanfan, president of China Aviation Supplies
Corp.
   The order comes a week after the Bush administration said it
would renew most-favored-nation status for China, a designation that
gives the country the lowest available tariffs on exports to the
United States.
   Nicholas Lardy, a professor of Chinese studies at the University
of Washington, Seattle, said he doubted there was any connection
between Bush's decision and the deal. ``Negotiations have been
proceeding for a long time,'' he noted.
   The Chinese government has been working to integrate itself into
the world economy, Lardy said, adding that this deal suggests their
talk is more than just rhetoric.
   But Wheeler and others said they doubt China would have placed
such an order without the favorable trade pact.
   ``It stands to reason that if the status were changed, it would
obviously alter their whole approach to capital goods,'' Wheeler
said.
   Dean Thornton, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group,
noted that Boeing was the first U.S. company to sell to China when
the two countries established relations in 1972. Since then, China
has purchased 101 Boeing planes, the company said.
   A plant in Xian, China, already manufactures tail fins for Boeing
737s.
   The Chinese order brings total Boeing orders this year to 187
aircraft valued at about $16.2 billion.

<HEAD>Current Account Surplus Posts Sharpest Drop in 10 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lower auto and steel exports combined with higher
imports of oil, autos, art and airplanes drove Japan's current
account surplus down by the steepest amount in 10 years.
   The surplus in the current account, which measures trade in
goods, services and transfer payments, fell 70 percent in April from
a year earlier to $2 billion. The surplus totaled $6.58 billion in
April 1989.
   It was the sharpest drop since the surplus contracted 95 percent
in June 1979.
   ``The current account is falling over the long term, and
eventually the surplus is going to shrink away,'' said Jan
VanDenBerg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ``The vast
majority of it is due to ... consumption demand in Japan growing
quite rapidly.''
   She said demand in Japan is growing by about 4 percent a year,
compared to less than 2 percent a year in the United States.
   April's trade surplus, which measures only trade in goods, shrank
50 percent to $4.02 billion, the ministry said.
   Imports, measured on the basis of settled contracts, rose 17
percent from year-ago levels to $17.2 billion while exports fell 7
percent to $21.2 billion, the ministry said. It was the seventh
consecutive month exports have declined.
   Part of the decline was due to the weaker yen, which reduced the
value of Japanese exports in dollar terms because of the time lag
before lower prices result in higher export volume.
   The dollar was trading at an average of 157.20 yen in April,
compared to 132.12 yen a year earlier, a 16 percent devaluation,
Finance Ministry officials noted.
   Automobile exports in April fell 19 percent from a year earlier,
the sharpest drop in 20 years. Ministry officials said this was
unusual because Japanese automakers usually boost exports at the
beginning of the new fiscal year in April after failing to fill
export quotas for the previous year.
   Auto imports rose for the fifth month in a row, up 72 percent in
April last year.
   Steel exports dropped 23 percent in April, the sixth month in a
row that they have fallen about 20 percent from year-earlier levels,
the ministry said. Much of the decline was attributed to strong
domestic demand for steel.
   Electric machinery exports fell 6 percent and semiconductor
exports fell 8.5 percent.
   Meanwhile, oil imports rose 22 percent along with heavy
production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and
speculation that prices will rise in the future, the ministry said.
   Aircraft imports rose 240 percent, timber and wood imports rose
42 percent and painting and art imports tripled.
   Invisible trade, which includes transactions in insurance,
shipping, tourism and other services, posted a $1.84 billion deficit
in April, compared with a deficit of $1.29 billion a year earlier.
   The ministry said the deficit was largely due to huge royalty
payments by foreign affiliate firms in Japan to their parent
companies overseas.
   Large purchases of foreign securities by Japanese investors
produced a deficit of $5.3 billion in the long-term capital account,
down from a $16.4 billion deficit a year earlier.
   An advisory council of the Finance Ministry said Thursday that
Japan's trade and current account surplus isn't a problem for the
world economy and could help finance Third World debtor nations and
the U.S. budget deficit.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also said Friday that the
surplus could help finance the development of Eastern Europe. But he
also said Japan should consider ways to reduce the surplus,
particularly with respect to the United States.
   The current account report does not include breakdowns of trade
by country or region. Last month, the Finance Ministry said Japan's
monthly trade surplus with the United States fell from $4.54 billion
a year earlier to $2.45 billion.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Exempts Itself From Anti-takeover Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s board has voted
to exempt the company from coverage under Pennsylvania's tough new
anti-takeover law.
   The company also said Thursday it will start buying back up to 20
million shares of its common stock.
   The law, signed April 27, is designed to protect
Pennsylvania-based corporations from hostile raiders. It has been
sharply attacked by the investment community for sheltering
management while denying stockholders the benefits of potential
price speculation in their shares.
   ``Westinghouse is strongly committed to increasing shareholder
value,'' Chairman John C. Marous said in a statement, adding that
customers, employees, suppliers and communities will benefit if the
company continues to operate successfully.
   Companies have the right to exempt themselves from the law in the
first 90 days of its existence.
   The company said in a separate statement it will purchase the
stock in public markets or through private sales during the next
year and a half. The company said it will use cash, internally
generated funds and short-term debt.
   ``The stock purchase is in keeping with our strategic direction
of enhancing shareholder value,'' Marous said.
   Marous said the stock purchase is an ``attractive investment.''
The stock closed Thursday at $36.37{, up $1.37{ on the New York
Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>ABC Will Use Own Audience-Measuring Formula in Some Cases</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC has come up with it own way to count
television viewers next season for purposes of compensating
advertisers for smaller-than-promised audiences.
   In the latest network reaction to an unexplained drop in A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings this year, ABC announced Thursday it will factor
previous years' ratings into its formula for so-called
``make-goods.'' The networks sell commercial time on the basis of
expected audiences, and give advertisers free air time to ``make
good'' for lower ratings.
   The ABC change will not affect the ratings reported to the
public, which generally have fallen since Nielsen switched to a
``people meter'' system that requires each participating viewer to
punch in when watching TV.
   ``What we're trying to address is the unexplainted volatility
that happened with the introduction of the people meters in the fall
of 1987,'' ABC spokesman Dick Connelly said.
   He said Thursday that the network had not heard reaction from
advertisers, but several ad agency executives were quoted in The New
York Times today as expressing anger.
   Betsy Frank, vice president of the agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi,
called the plan ``confusing and insulting.''
   Advertisers are about to begin their yearly advance purchases of
air time, which could account for $4 billion of the $9 billion to
$10 billion in total network sales predicted for next fall.
   CBS, which has been running third in the ratings, had no comment
on ABC's action, said CBS spokesman Michael Silver. NBC spokesman
Curt Block said that top-rated network ``is trying to work out an
arrangement'' of its own with advertisers ``that is fair to
everbody.''
   Last month, a group representing the networks and the National
Association of Broadcasters asked Nielsen to study new ways of
counting viewers.
   Nielsen, which says it has found no flaws in its people-meter
system, said it would consider the request. The ratings company
earns a total of $20 million annually from the three networks,
according to a network executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.

   The stock market ran up a broad gain today as
traders responded to new evidence of a weaker-than-expected economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.69 to 2,888.35 in
the first half hour of the session.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by almost 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 777 up, 279 down and
463 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 32.47 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department this morning reported a rise of 164,000 in
nonfarm payroll employment during May, attributing the increase
almost entirely to temporary hiring for the Census.
   Job figures for April were revised to show a decrease rather than
the small gain reported earlier.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
said no job growth at all has been registered in the private sector
of the economy over the last three months.
   While that news did not bode well for corporate profits in the
near future, analysts said it was welcomed on Wall Street as a
possible portent of further declines in interest rates and an easing
in the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   The bond market made its view of the news clear immediately.
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds jumped more than $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to the 8.45 percent-8.50
percent range.
   Westinghouse Electric rose ~ to 37\ on top of a 1&rsqb;-point gain
Thursday, when the company said it plans to buy back as many as 20
million shares of its stock.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, Boeing climbed 1&lsqb; to 83{;
General Electric ~ to 69}; Philip Morris \ to 42&rsqb;, and Texas
Instruments &rsqb; to 42&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.54 to 197.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .49 at 363.55.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.90 to
2,876.66.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 783 up, 675 down and 547 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 165.69 million shares, against 199.54
million in the previous session.

   The recent plan to slowly shift the Soviet Union
toward a market economy has cheered a group of U.S. financiers, who
believe the reforms will bolster their efforts to bring a novel type
of public finance to Moscow.
   The group signed an agreement with several Soviet entities in
April to finance three public projects with bonds designed to
encourage the shift away from central planning and toward the market
mechanism.
   ``This project can help us find financial instruments that can
help us solve several problems at the same time,'' said Sergei
Plekhanov, deputy director of the Institute of the USA and Canada,
one of the Soviet bodies involved in the agreement.
   Plekhanov said his country has massive social needs that go unmet
because of its huge budget deficit. At the same time, households and
state enterprises are sitting on tens of billions of rubles for want
of goods to buy.
   Those problems were among the chief reasons behind the
government's reform plan announced two weeks ago. It laid out a
five-year schedule of food price hikes, banking reforms and partial
privatizations designed to produce a so-called regulated market
economy.
   Many radical Soviet reformers found the plan too timid. They
criticized the government for backing away from the model created by
Poland, which has attempted to move rapidly to a market economy by
sharply devaluing the currency, cutting state subsidies and freeing
prices.
   But Jeffrey A. Sachs, who initiated the financing project, says
the Soviet's gradual strategy is more humane than Polish-style
``shock therapy,'' and more fitting for a country that hasn't known
a market for 70 years. (Sachs is unrelated to the Harvard University
professor of the same name who helped devise Poland's program.)
   Rather than shrink the supply of money to match the amount of
goods in the economy, as Poland is doing, Sachs wants to tap into
the Soviets' big pool of savings to finance new projects.
   Using a non-profit corporation called EcoLink, Sachs' group is
working on plans to issue bonds in the Soviet Union to finance three
projects: an AIDS hospital, an industrial project _ most likely a
grain-storage facility, and a prototype network of regional
financial exchanges.
   Soviet citizens have a bad taste for bonds because the government
forced purchases of bonds under Stalin and later repudiated them.
Also, the ruble has little value because it can't be converted into
Western currencies and can't buy much at home.
   EcoLink argues that bonds can be made palateable, however, by
having them pay interest in hard currency or in rubles that will
guarantee the ability to buy scarce Soviet resources. The
instruments could help contain inflation by absorbing excess cash
and foster a move to allocating goods through the market rather than
central planning agencies.
   Hard currency bonds would be appropriate for a grain-storage
facility, Sachs suggests. Already the government spends large
amounts of hard currency to import grain while perhaps 25 percent of
Soviet harvests rot for lack of storage bins and railroad grain
cars, he says. Therefore, any investments that reduce grain losses
should save hard currency.
   ``That's an immediate economic benefit that can pay for itself,''
says Muriel Siebert, a financial market consultant and former New
York State banking commissioner who is involved in EcoLink.
   In April the group asked U.S. financial and legal experts to come
forward with suggestions to turn the project ideas into reality.
Sachs said dozens of investment banks and law firms have expressed
interest.
   The project backers are due to meet in Moscow in July to draw up
solid plans for the AIDS hospital and decide on the industrial
project.
   Work on financial exchanges is just beginning. Siebert said
EcoLink is likely to propose that exchanges be set up to handle
commodities that the Soviets already have some experience in trading
_ grain, oil and gold.
   Talk of bond issues and Soviet financial exchanges might have
seemed far-fetched just months ago, Plekhanov said. ``Now all these
things are very much in line with the official policy. I think that
will speed things up.''

   The 62 branches of Western Savings &amp; Loan
Association reopen today as branches of Bank of America Arizona
following the acquisition of the seized thrift's deposits and branch
system.
   Western, placed under federal conservatorship in June 1989, was
put up for sale in January. Western had lost hundreds of millions of
dollars during the past two years in real-estate loans that soured.
   Western ranks just under such notorious S&amp;L collapses as Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., and CenTrust Bank of
Miami, both expected to cost taxpayers around a record $2 billion
each.
   The acquisition of Western by Bank of America Arizona, a
subsidiary of San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp., was approved by
the board of the federal Resolution Trust Corp.
   ``We plan to be a significant part of the Arizona economy and
want to build on our local identity,'' said David Weymouth,
president of Bank of America Arizona. ``Bank of America Arizona is a
community bank with the backing of a major financial institution.''
   Before acquiring Western's branch system, BankAmerica's presence
in Arizona consisted of two small, non-banking operations in
Phoenix: BankAmerica Sutter Mortgage Corp., an interim construction
lender with 25 employees, and Bank of America Payroll Services, a
payroll processing firm with a staff of 50.
   Bank of America, whose parent is the nation's third largest
holding company, estimated its share of the Phoenix area's market at
about 12 percent.
   A spokesman for the RTC, the federal agency in charge of
insolvent thrifts, said Bank of America paid a premium of $81.2
million for Western's $3.4 billion in deposits. The bank is
purchasing $1.7 billion worth of the thrift's performing assets,
including investment-grade securities, single-family home loans and
consumer loans.
   The RTC said it is retaining assets with a book value of
approximately $2.9 billion, including troubled or non-paying loans,
commercial and construction loans, loans on land and multifamily
residences, and repossessed real estate.
   According to the RTC, it will pay Bank of America $1.7 billion in
cash, beyond $1.1 billion in prior cash advances.
   With recovery of its cash advances expected through the sale of
assets not purchased by Bank of America, the RTC's ultimate cost
will total an estimated $1.7 billion, the agency said.
   Western ranks just under such notorious S&amp;L collapses as Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., and CenTrust Bank of
Miami, each of which is expected to cost taxpayers a record $2
billion.
   The acquisition was hailed by state Banking Superintendent Hank
Rivoir.
   ``I am looking forward to another major player in the financial
community,'' Rivoir said. ``It will be a benefit to the Arizona
consumer. It is good that Western has been resolved.''
   Western, founded 61 years ago, had 61 branches in Maricopa
County, which includes Phoenix, and one in Salt Lake City. The
branches include 24 in Smitty's supermarkets.
   After reopening under the Bank of America name, the branches will
operate under their normal schedules, and deposits will be insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the RTC said.
   Losers in the bidding for Western included Security Pacific Corp.
and Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
   The state charter was revised under last-minute legislation that
closed a loophole in Arizona' interstate banking law. A bill was
rushed through the Legislature and signed by Gov. Rose Mofford late
Thursday.
   Rivoir told lawmakers that some attorneys have interpreted the
state's 1985 interstate banking act as allowing out-of-state banks
to buy Arizona institutions and operate them as branches without
being subject to Arizona regulations.
   The legislation was aimed primarily at Bank of America, although
it would apply to the sale of any Arizona bank.
   Peter Magnani, BankAmerica vice president for corporate public
relations, said his bank has had an interest in Arizona for many
years but was not in the financial position to participate when
interstate banking was permitted as a result of the 1985 law.
   Besides Bank of America, BankAmerica's holdings include SeaFirst
Corp., Seattle First National Bank and Bank of America Nevada,
formerly Nevada First Bank.
   ``This acquisition provides us with an excellent vehicle for
entering Arizona and advancing toward our strategic goal of being
the premier provider of retail and wholesale financial services in
the western United States,'' said Richard M. Roseberg, BankAmerica
chairman and chief executive.

   Press lawyers expressed disappointment
that the state Supreme Court abolished a sales tax exemption after
ruling the tax was unconstitutionally levied on magazines and not on
newspapers.
   ``It's winning the battle but losing the war,'' said James Ervin
Jr., a Tallahassee lawyer representing several magazines that had
challenged the state's imposition of its 6-cent sales tax on
magazines.
   Ervin said he was pleased the justices ruled that in the interest
of freedom of the press, there should be no differentiation between
the two types of publications. But he said he was ``very
disappointed'' in the panel's 6-0 opinion Thursday extending the tax
rather than the exemption.
   William Hyde, an attorney representing the Florida Press
Association, said an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is likely.
   ``It's making the acquisition of knowledge more difficult,'' Hyde
said.
   ``We think that a tax on the press impermissibly burdens the
First Amendment,'' said Laura Besvinick, an attorney representing
The Miami Herald.
   Sales of all magazines in Florida have been taxed since 1987,
when the state dropped an exemption for subscriptions as part of the
extension of the sales tax to a variety of services and the sale of
newspapers.
   The services tax was repealed a few months later, at which time
newspapers regained their exemption but subscription magazines did
not. Magazines sold in stores had been taxed even before 1987.
   The Magazine Publishers of America Inc., The Hearst Corp., Time
Inc., Golf Digest-Tennis Inc. and others went to court.
   The state Department of Revenue, the press organization, and the
Herald argued that the distinction between the two kinds of
publications should be upheld. But while the revenue agency argued
the tax should be extended to both types of publications, the
newspapers argued the exemption should be extended.
   A circuit court in Tallahassee ruled for the magazines, barring
the state from collecting taxes. The 1st District Court of Appeal
passed the issue up to the state's high court as a question of
``great public importance.''
   Hyde said he was optimistic the U.S. Supreme Court would agree to
review the case because the issue is being considered in courts all
over the country.

   The stock market gained ground today as traders
responded to new evidence of a weaker-than-expected economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.99 to 2,886.65 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 754 up, 518 down and
520 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 70.10 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Labor Department this morning reported a rise of 164,000 in
nonfarm payroll employment during May, attributing the increase
almost entirely to temporary hiring for the Census.
   Job figures for April were revised to show a decrease rather than
the small gain reported earlier.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
said no job growth at all has been registered in the private sector
of the economy over the last three months.
   While that news did not bode well for corporate profits in the
near future, analysts said it was welcomed on Wall Street as a
possible portent of further declines in interest rates and an easing
in the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   The bond market made its view of the news clear immediately.
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds jumped more than $10 for each
$1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to the 8.45 percent-8.50
percent range.
   Westinghouse Electric rose &lsqb; to 36{ on top of a 1&rsqb;-point gain
Thursday, when the company said it plans to buy back as many as 20
million shares of its stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.30 to 197.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .40 at 363.46.

<HEAD>Manufacturing Expanded In May, Purchasing Managers Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturing expanded in May for the second
straight month with production and new orders leading the way, the
nation's purchasing managers said in a survey released today.
   Economists said the increase showed the manufacuring sector might
be struggling back but added that that today's unemployment report
gave a slightly conflicting message.
   The government said the unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage
point to 5.3 percent in May. However, an increase of 164,000 new
jobs included 145,000 temporary census workers. Private economists
had expected non-government industries to create at least 125,000
new jobs in May, far greater than the 19,000 that were added.
   ``Today's unemployment report just doesn't square with the
purchasing managers,'' said Allen Sinai, an economist with Boston
Co. in New York.
   ``Probably the (purchasing managers) survey is reflecting
strength in aerospace and still reflecting some rebound in autos,''
he said, adding that recoveries in automobile production apparently
are not being matched by sales.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management's economic
index rose to 50.7 percent in May, up from 50.2 percent the month
before. A reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is
generally expanding; below 50, that it is generally declining.
   The production index increased significantly, from 53 percent in
April to 56.3 percent in May. New orders increased, but at a much
slower rate than in April.
   April's increase followed 11 straight months of declines, the
group said in a press release from its Tempe, Ariz. headquarters.
   The purchasing managers' report is based on a monthly survey of
purchasing executives at more than 300 industrial companies. Most of
the figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Higher in Slack Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   There is little news to guide the market, so prices might drift
lower as trading progresses, said Victor Lespinasse of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Soybeans may get a boost due to talk of increased European
interest in soymeal.
   Forecasts of severe thunderstorms in much of the Midwest over the
weekend may not have much impact on soybean and corn futures,
Lespinasse said, adding that weather concerns have already been
factored into the market.
   Wheat futures may get a boost from the purchase of 100-thousand
metric tons by China. Continued delays in the harvesting of the
winter crop may also lift wheat prices.
   In early trading, wheat was a { cent lower to 1{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.33{ a bushel; corn was
a \ cent to 2\ cents higher with July at $2.78} a bushel; oats were
a { cent to 1{ cents higher with July at $1.46 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with July at $6.09\ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork mixed in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were boosted by active fed cattle sales at steady
prices.
   Hog prices rose due to beliefs that the selloffs on Wednesday and
Thursday were overdone. Frozen pork belly futures were supported by
higher fresh wholesale belly prices.
   Cattle were .25 cent to .38 cent lower with June at 74.30 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .55 cent higher with August at
84.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .42 cent lower to .15 cent
higher with June at 65.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.05 cent lower to 1.20 cent higher with July at 64 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled lower in Thursday's trading.

<HEAD>West Germany Joins France In Banning British Beef</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany joined France Friday in banning British
beef imports because of the ``mad cow'' disease that has killed
thousands of cattle and prompted many Britons to shun the meat.
   However, the European Community offered a helping hand to
Britain's cattle industry by offering to buy 20,600 tons of meat.
   British officials say the beef poses no threat to people who eat
it. That country's Meat and Livestock Commission accused the Germans
of responding to fears about a flood of cheap British beef, rather
than concern for public health.
   Britain made similar charges Thursday about the French ban.
   France, which normally purchases more than half Britain's
exported beef, imposed its ban Wednesday. French officials said some
meat might be tainted by the so-called ``mad cow'' disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
   The fatal nervous disorder causes a degeneration of brain tissue
in infected cattle, but British officials say there is no evidence
the disease can be transmitted to humans.
   West Germany, which already had barred imports of British beef
still on the bone, emulated France today by extending the ban to
canned beef.
   The Agriculture Ministry in Bonn said it feared that British beef
normally destined for France might be rerouted to West Germany. A
total ban was necessary ``to protect consumers from infection,'' the
ministry said.
   A team of French veterinarians sent to Britain to assess the
disease returned today to submit its report. France's Agriculture
Ministry said no decision on the duration of the ban would be made
until after a meeting of the European Community's veterinary
committee.
   However, British agriculture officials said the committee meeting
had been postponed indefinitely.
   European Community officials denounced France's ban Thursday as
illegal and demanded it be revoked.
   In Brussels, Belgium, EC headquarters announced today that the
Community would buy 20,600 tons of British beef to help shore up
falling meat prices.
   The British Meat and Livestock Commission said bans and fears
arising from the disease are costing their industry about $850,000 a
day. Beef sales reportedly have fallen by about 30 percent in
Britain.
   Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union in
Britain, called for retaliatory action f the bans persist. But he
did not elaborate.
   The disease, which was identified in Britain in 1986, is blamed
for killing 13,648 cows there.
   The cause is unknown. Because the symptoms are similar to
scrapie, a sheep disease, it is assumed the disease was transmitted
through cattle feeds. They use sheep offal as a protein supplement.

<HEAD>Airline Lowers Fare for Soviet Emigres</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan American World Airways is knocking a few
rubles off the cost of emigrating from the Soviet Union to the
United States.
   The airline announced Friday it is offering a one-way ticket to
the U.S. for $999, a 32 percent discount from the regular fare of
$1,466.
   Pan Am said the fare is designed to help the flow of immigrants
to the U.S. It said their access to air travel has been restricted
by a requirement that they fly on the Soviet airline Aeroflot, which
has limited seating and expensive fares.
   Emigres can skirt the requirement by buying the discounted
tickets outside the Soviet Union and arranging through Pan Am to
pick them up in the country, said Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth
Hlinko.
   The discounted flights are available from Moscow and Leningrad.

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed against other major
currencies in Europe Friday after the release of disappointing U.S.
employment figures signaled slower U.S. economic growth.
   Gold prices fell.
   The dollar declined after the U.S. data showed unexpectedly small
growth in U.S. non-farm payrolls in May. U.S. non-farm payrolls rose
163,000, but the number was inflated by the addition of census
workers.
   The April figure was revised downward to a decline of 23,000,
reversing a preliminary rise of 64,000.
   The report signaled slower U.S. economic growth and also reduced
inflationary pressures, which prompted interest rates to fall in the
U.S. bond market.
   But profit-taking on other currencies helped the dollar recover
somewhat.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6840 from $1.6760 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
levels were: 1.6940 West German marks, down from 1.6990; 1.4358
Swiss francs, up from 1.4325; 5.7180 French francs, down from
5.7300; 1.9073 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9060; 1,247.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,247.00; and 1.1728 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1740.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.17 yen, up 0.42 yen from
Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 151.45
yen.
   Selected dollar quotes in the early afternoon in New York
included: 1.6970 West German marks; 151.85 Japanese yen; 1.4384
Swiss francs; 1.17325 Canadian dollars; and 1,247.25 Italian lire.
   The pound was quoted at $1.68215 in early afternoon U.S. trading.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $361.25 a troy ounce
from $363.75 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $363.00 from $364.00
late Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped 21 cents to close at $365.04 on Friday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.05 a troy
ounce from $5.08 bid late Thursday.

Nintendo home video game system, causes Nintendo game characters to
move at slower speeds or bypass obstacles originally programmed into
the games. It allows players to skip entire game levels, and to add
extra ``lives'' to a player's life.
   Nintendo claims the product, created by Lewis Galoob Toys of
South San Francisco, creates ``derivative'' works of copyrighted
Nintendo games.
   ``U.S. copyright law prevents third parties from creating and
marketing `derivatives' of copyrighted video games without the
express consent of the game's owner,'' Howard Lincoln, Nintendo's
senior vice president, said in a press release announcing the suit
Thursday.
   Galoob introduced Game Genie on May 8 and sued Nintendo on May 17
after Nintendo notified Galoob of its claim of copyright
infringement. Galoob's suit seeks a court declaration that Game
Genie does not infringe Nintendo copyrights.
   Nintendo filed its lawsuit after deciding to reject a proposal
that Nintendo give Galoob a license to market Game Genie, Nintendo
said.
   Lincoln compared Game Genie to ``speed-up kits'' which were
introduced for the popular arcade game Pacman several years ago.
Courts found such kits to be unauthorized derivative works of the
original Pacman game and enjoined their sale.
   But Steven M. Klein, executive vice president and general counsel
at Galoob, rejected any links to the Pacman situation. Game Genie is
for use in private homes, while the Pacman speed-up kits were
designed for use in public video arcades, he said in a telephone
interview Friday.
   ``Home owners can modify games. Selling them a product that
allows them to do that is not illegal,'' he said.
   ``Nintendo has conveniently ignored provisions of the copyright
act that allows a product like this to be sold,'' he said.
   Lincoln said Game Genie allows Nintendo games to be mastered
without any skill.
   ``We cannot stand by while the essence of our business _ the
creation of ever more challenging video games _ is put at risk by
the Game Genie product,'' he said.
   Klein did not dispute that Game Genie allows success with
Nintendo games without requiring skill, but denied it would be
detrimental to Nintendo.
   ``Nintendo believes anything that interferes with their monopoly
is a threat to their business,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shareholder Rights Big Winner In This Season's Contests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990 annual meetings and their scuffles and
skirmishes are largely over, and all the combatants are claiming
victory _ even if the vote tallies don't show it.
   The clearest winners this season were shareholders, particularly
the big institutional investors no longer content with passive
ownership in the stocks of corporate America.
   ``It was a banner year for institutional shareholders,'' said
Gray Davis, the comptroller of California and a trustee of the
state's employee pension funds, the largest in the nation.
   Davis was a prominent voice in pressing for a greater shareholder
role in how companies are run during this annual meeting season, the
primary forum for dialogue between management and the owners they
must answer to.
   Todd Lang, a New York attorney who specializes in corporate
shareholder law, said ``this has been the season when the
institutions, which own more than a majority of the equities in the
United States, have gone active with their positions.''
   Shareholders placed more issues on annual meeting agendas this
season and institutions became more vocal.
   The shareholders' biggest triumph came early in the season,
before and during the March 29 annual meeting of Lockheed Corp., as
dissident investor Harold Simmons waged a proxy fight with
management to gain control of the defense contractor's board of
directors.
   Simmons lost, but management was frightened he might win. So the
company granted big concessions, including a promise to put at least
one institutional investor representative on the board.
   Shareholders also won votes on several proposals, among them a
call for confidential proxy voting, which would enable them to vote
free from coercive pressure like in a political election.
   In many companies, shareholders sought a bigger voice in
corporate policy and governance. At the K mart Corp. and Avon
Products Inc. meetings, for example, shareholders approved
non-binding resolutions asking management to submit the companies'
``poison pill'' takeover defenses to shareholder votes.
   These measures, which make hostile takeovers more expensive,
generally fall under the jurisdiction of directors. Many
shareholders don't like pills because they can block attractive
prices stock in a takeover fight.
   There was other evidence of shareholder activism. Although
management proposals generally were approved, in some cases they won
by slimmer margins than in past votes.
   At the Time Warner Inc. meeting, management's stock incentive
plan was approved, but one-quarter of the shares _ a relatively
large bloc _ were cast against it.
   Management wasn't the only group coming up short this year.
Stockholders also refused to rally around corporate takeover
strategists.
   At Lockheed, where Simmons sought to install allies on the board,
and at American General Corp., where suitor Torchmark Inc. had
similar plans, shareholders voted against the insurgents.
   The outcome was expected to be the same at USX Corp., where
shareholders voted on investor Carl Icahn's non-binding proposal to
break up the steel-energy conglomerate. The tally had not been
completed by the end of last week, but Icahn had already said he
expected to lose.
   Lang, a partner with the firm Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges in New York,
said the shareholders are listening to the dissidents' ideas, but
``they're probably going to vote with their pocketbooks.''
   Harry DeAngelo, a finance professor at the University of
Michigan, agreed. ``There's a tendency for (shareholders) to go with
the incumbent group unless the dissidents have a tangible proposal
for distributing value'' or raising a company's stock price, he said.
   That was the case at Lockheed and USX, where Simmons and Icahn
had ideas about ways to increase the price of the companies' stock
but did not offer shareholders any guarantees.
   Torchmark also had little concrete value to offer. The suitor had
encountered obstacles in its attempt to buy American General and
resorted to a proxy fight.
   Dissidents had some victories, however. The Belzberg family of
Canada managed to win one seat on the board of Armstrong World
Industries Inc., though it subsequently scrapped a takeover offer
for the company. Dissident shareholders upset the entire board of
XTRA Corp., a trailer leasing company.
   Icahn and Simmons said they expected to eventually come out ahead
financially even if they fell short of votes. Both said they expect
management ultimately to respond to their complaints and take steps
to boost the value of their stock.
   Shareholders did suffer disappointment this season _ perhaps the
biggest came in their struggle with Exxon Corp. over the oil
company's environmental record.
   The funds of which Davis is a trustee and the pension funds of
New York City and Massachusetts had sought assurances from Exxon
that it would improve safety procedures following the Exxon Valdez
oil spill off Alaska last year. Management refused to adopt any
environmental proposal made by shareholders.
   Nevertheless, Davis said, ``We're not going away and Exxon will
have to come to terms with its environmental indifference.''
   Davis said he expects shareholder power _ particularly that of
the big institutions _ to increase over the next 10 years as the
pension funds increase their stakes in U.S. companies. He predicted
management will be forced to consult regularly with shareholders.
   Right now, he acknowledged, shareholders have more leverage in
situations where management faces a threat, such as a takeover or
proxy fight. But he looks for that to change.
   Lang agreed that institutional shareholders ``have enormous
potential power,'' but said their new activism poses a number of
legal questions.
   For example, under Securities and Exchange Commission
regulations, institutional investors are subject to different
disclosure requirements according to their level of activism. But if
an institution that was previously considered passive becomes more
activist, it could find itself in violation of SEC rules, Lang said.
   Shareholders face other dilemmas as they seek a bigger role _
especially as they clamor for places on boards of directors.
   ``A member of a board is supposed to represent all the
shareholders,'' said John Lubin, a management professor at the
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ``If they go on
the board, legally and in every sense, they're not supposed to
represent their own interests.''

<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed against other major
currencies in Europe Friday after the release of disappointing U.S.
employment figures signaled slower U.S. economic growth.
   Gold prices fell.
   The dollar declined after the U.S. data showed unexpectedly small
growth in U.S. non-farm payrolls in May. U.S. non-farm payrolls rose
163,000, but the number was inflated by the addition of census
workers.
   The April figure was revised downward to a decline of 23,000,
reversing a preliminary rise of 64,000.
   The report signaled slower U.S. economic growth and also reduced
inflationary pressures, which prompted interest rates to fall in the
U.S. bond market.
   But profit-taking on other currencies helped the dollar recover
somewhat.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6840 from $1.6760 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
levels were: 1.6940 West German marks, down from 1.6990; 1.4358
Swiss francs, up from 1.4325; 5.7180 French francs, down from
5.7300; 1.9073 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9060; 1,247.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,247.00; and 1.1728 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1740.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.17 yen, up 0.42 yen from
Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 151.45
yen.
   Selected dollar quotes in the early afternoon in New York
included: 1.6970 West German marks; 151.85 Japanese yen; 1.4384
Swiss francs; 1.17325 Canadian dollars; and 1,247.25 Italian lire.
   The pound was quoted at $1.68215 in early afternoon U.S. trading.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $361.25 a troy ounce
from $363.75 late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $363.00 from $364.00
late Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped 21 cents to close at $365.04 on Friday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.05 a troy
ounce from $5.08 bid late Thursday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as improving weather and lack
of a trade agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States
weighed on the market.
   Soybeans dropped sharply after the July contract slipped below
$6.05 a bushel, triggering more selling.
   One reason for the decline was a National Weather Service
forecast calling for dry conditions much of next week, which will
facilitate planting of soybeans, said William Biedermann, an analyst
will Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean plantings had been delayed by soggy fields.
   Corn futures were pushed lower by progress made this week in
planting the corn crop.
   Biedermann noted that light export business and a lack of
progress in trade talks during the summit meeting between President
Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev also weighed on corn
futures.
   Fairly good weather, allowing for progress in the harvesting of
the winter crop, pushed wheat futures lower.
   At the close, wheat prices were 1 cent to 4\ cents lower, with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.29{ a bushel; corn was 1}
cents to 2\ cents lower with July at $2.76 a bushel; oats were a {

   The stock market forged ahead today as traders
responded to new evidence of a weaker-than-expected economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 13.63 to 2,890.29
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 938 up, 587 down and
476 unchanged.
   The Labor Department this morning reported a rise of 164,000 in
nonfarm payroll employment during May, attributing the increase
almost entirely to temporary hiring for the Census.
   Job figures for April were revised to show a decrease rather than
the small gain reported earlier.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
said no job growth at all has been registered in the private sector
of the economy over the last three months.
   While that news did not bode well for corporate profits in the
near future, analysts said it was welcomed on Wall Street as a
possible portent of further declines in interest rates and an easing
in the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   The bond market made its view of the news abundantly clear.
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds jumped nearly $10 for each $1,000
in face value, lowering their yields to the 8.41 percent-8.45
percent range.
   L.A. Gear tumbled 8} to 30{. The company estimated significantly
lower earnings for the fiscal quarter that ended Thursday.
   Westinghouse Electric rose { to 36~ on top of a 1&rsqb;-point gain
Thursday, when the company said it plans to buy back as many as 20
million shares of its stock.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, Ford Motor rose | to 46};
Philip Morris ~ to 43; General Electric \ to 69&lsqb;, and McDonald's 1&lsqb;

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.67 to 197.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .65 at 363.71.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 160.57 million shares with an

<HEAD>Debt Holders OK Plan to Defer Interest Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Campeau Corp. bondholders approved a
proposal by the financially distressed company to defer certain
interest payments until the end of 1991 while it tries to
restructure.
   More than the necessary two-thirds majority of the bondholders
supported the extraordinary resolution, a Campeau spokesman said
after a meeting in Toronto, where the Canadian company is based.
   Spokesman Richard W. Wertheim said the actual vote count wouldn't
be known for several days, until a final tally is completed.
   Campeau, parent of two extensive U.S. retailing companies now in
bankruptcy court proceedings, had said that a ``significant negative
cash flow'' due to debt service obligations forced it to seek the
deferral until Dec. 31, 1991.
   The company is negotiating similar deferrals with other creditors.
   Management of Campeau has developed a business plan designed to
restructure the company's financial affairs. It involves substantial
real estate and other asset sales.
   Campeau's restructuring has no direct bearing on the
reorganization of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp., the two Campeau-owned American retailing companies based in
Cincinnati. They filed for protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in January.
   At the Toronto meeting, Paul Campbell, president of Campeau's
Canadian operations, said the company ``will face many more
challenges in the months ahead.''
   He said there was ``no immediate prospect of an infusion of
equity'' into Campeau.
   The group that approved the deferral Friday were owners of
Campeau's 7{ percent convertible subordinated debentures, a type of
bond. The debentures are Campeau's only publicly held debt. The rest
of its outstanding debt was placed privately.
   Robert Campeau, company founder and its chairman and chief
executive, did not attend the meeting, Wertheim said. Campeau and
his family hold about 42 percent of the debentures and Olympia &amp;
York Developments Ltd., a Canada-based property development company
and a major Campeau creditor, holds 25.3 percent. The rest of are
widely held.

<HEAD>Purchasing Managers Report Manufacturing Rebound, Economists
Skeptical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A survey of purchasing managers indicated on
Friday an improvement in manufacturing in May, but economists said
the report was overshadowed and contradicted by government
unemployment numbers.
   Gains in production and new orders led the increase, the second
in as many months for the purchasing managers' index.
   The rise in the index is more a sign that the manufacturing slump
has hit bottom, than a precursor of a strong recovery, , said James
Solloway, director of economic research at Argus Research Inc. in
New York.
   ``It does show some stability in manufacturing coming in. But
things are still soft,'' Solloway said.
   Economists also said the report by the National Association of
Purchasing Management was probably influenced by increased
automobile production that is not being matched by sales.
   The purchasing managers' index rose to 50.7 percent in May, up
from 50.2 percent the month before. A reading above 50 indicates the
manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50, that it is
generally declining.
   It was the highest level for the purchasing managers' index since
it reached 52.7 percent in April 1989.
   ``The index is giving us a rosier picture of manufacturing than
is justified,'' Allen Sinai, an economist at Boston Co. in New York,
said, noting weak unemployment figures.
   The government said Friday the unemployment rate fell 0.1
percentage point to 5.3 percent in May. However, an increase of
164,000 new jobs was almost entirely due to the addition of
temporary census workers. Private economists had expected
non-government industries to create at least 125,000 new jobs in
May, far greater than the 19,000 that were added.
   According to the purchasing managers' report, the production
index increased significantly, to 56.3 percent from 53 percent in
April. The new orders index came in at 54.8 percent, but that was a
slower growth rate than the 55.5 percent figure for April.
   New export orders also grew in May, although the increase was not
as much as reported the two previous months. The new export orders
index was 54 percent, down from 60.5 percent in April and 59.5
percent in March.
   The production managers reported declining prices in May,
resuming a trend that began nearly a year ago. The price index
increased in April, for the first time since last May, to 50.8. It
dropped to 48.5 last month.
   Christopher Low, an economist at CM&amp;M Group, a New York
investment group, said: ``The increase in orders shows the
manufacturing sector is struggling back. The inflation shows
declines in commodities prices, but what that misses is increases in
labor costs and service industry prices.''
   April's increase in the overall index followed 11 straight months
of declines, the group said in a press release from its Tempe, Ariz.
headquarters.
   The purchasing managers' report is based on a monthly survey of
purchasing executives at more than 300 industrial companies. Most of
the figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.

   Here's a regional breakdown of real estate market conditions
throughout the United States, based on reports from realtors,
lenders and economists:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NORTHEAST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Conditions are sluggish partly because of an oversupply of homes.
Big layoffs on Wall Street and weakeness in Massachusetts'
high-tech-dominated economy have softened demand for housing and
brought recession-like conditions to the area _ a reversal from a
few years ago when some homes were appreciating in double-digit
rates. Many homes are falling in value _ as much as 1 percent per
month in some pockets of metropolitan New York, while the length of
time needed to sell a home is rising.
   Home prices were off on average 3 percent to 5 percent during the
first quarter of 1990 from a year ago in cities like Hartford,
Conn.; Boston and New York, the National Association of Realtors
says. New Haven, Conn., was especially weak, with prices down 11
percent. Pockets of strength include Buffalo, Rochester and Albany,
N.Y., where prices were up between 2 percent and 12 percent. Another
exception is Pittsburgh, where home values were reported to be
stable and prices are considered comparably affordable.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MIDWEST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Unlike the Northeast, where prices exploded in the '80s, homes in
this region appreciated more modestly. Lower prices and ``quality of
life'' benefits have attracted many businesses and are supporting
demand for housing.
   Examples of prices increases as of the first quarter, according
to the Realtors association, include: Akron, Ohio, up 17.5 percent;
Grand Rapids, Mich., 14 percent; Chicago, 12 percent; Milwaukee, 7.5
percent; Cincinnati, 7 percent; Detroit, 6.5 percent; and
Louisville, Ky., 3 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SOUTH</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The region is mixed. Many cities in the Southeast are strong
economically. A few ``oil-patch'' areas around Texas remain weak,
although cities like Houston and Dallas are reported to be
rebounding.
   Cities where home prices have risen or remain stable, according
to the Realtors, include: Baltimore, up 13 percent; Houston, up 12
percent; Miami, 8 percent; Dallas, 5 percent; San Antonio, Texas, 2
percent; Washington, D.C., unchanged; and Birmingham, Ala.,
unchanged. Among the weak spots: Oklahoma City and New Orleans, down
around 2 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WEST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Also mixed. California real estate remains strong but the pace of
increases in home sales and prices has slowed from the dizzying rate
of just a year and a half ago. Some Californians, particularly from
bigger cities like Los Angeles, decided to cash out and move to less
expensive areas, increasing the supply of available homes.
   Cities like Denver and Phoenix continue to have serious economic
problems due partly to volatility in the oil industry and the
collapse of many savings and loans, although some real estate
markets are showing signs of stabilizing.
   Examples of increases in home prices, according to the Realtors:
Sacramento, Calif., up 27 percent; Las Vegas, 10 percent; Los
Angeles, 5 percent; Orange County, Calif., 3 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NORTHWEST</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Conditions are healthy, making this region the brightest spot for
real estate in the United States. Demand for housing is outstripping
supply partly because of an influx of outsiders. Californians
constitute at least half of all out-of-state buyers.
   Home prices in Seattle soared 36.5 percent over a year ago,
according to the Realtors _ the highest appreciation rate in the
nation. Portland, Ore., was up 12 percent.

<HEAD>IBM Sells 13,000 Personal Computers To Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. said Friday
it has signed its biggest contract yet with the Soviet Union, under
which it will supply over 13,000 personal computers for use in
schools.
   ``It is a significant step up from the level of (Soviet) business
we've been doing before,'' said IBM spokesman Mac Jeffery.
   The value of the contract was not disclosed, but Jeffrey said the
Soviets will pay in a convertible currency and that they received a
discount comparable to the one IBM offers other customers for
computers bought for educational use.
   Barry Bosak, an industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said the contract could be worth $20 million to $30 million,
depending on the discount and the types of printers and other
equipment included. He said it probably ranks among the largest
sales of computer equipment to the Soviet Union by a Western company.
   Jeffery said IBM has been selling computers in the Soviet Union
since 1975, but he declined to quantify the earlier sales.``We hope
this will lead to other things,'' he said.
   IBM and the U.S.S.R. State Committees for Education and
Informatics said in a statement that the contract ``could form the
basis for the build-up of assembly operations for personal computers
in the U.S.S.R.,'' and that feasibility studies on such assembly
operations have been launched.
   ``It is something that both sides are seriously looking at,''
Jeffery said, declining to elaborate.
   Bosak said the possibility of building Soviet assembly plants is
more important than the size of the contract. Setting up an assembly
operation ``would give them (IBM) a working base,'' he said.
   As part of the deal with the state education committee, IBM will
provide 150 educational software packages that have been translated
into Russian. In addition, IBM will work with outside software
companies to provide additional applications programs and will train
Soviet software engineers to write educational software, Jeffery
said.
   IBM also will train teachers to use the computers, he said.
   The contract is for IBM's Personal System-2 machines featuring
Intel Corp.'s 80286 microprocessor _ the most sophisticated
microprocessor allowed to be exported to the Soviet Union by U.S.
companies under current export rules, Jeffery said.
   Shipments will begin in September in time for some schools to

<HEAD>Argentina Reportedly Ready to Resume Interest Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina is to resume
negotiations next week with creditor banks over the possible
resumption of interest payments for the first time in two years on
its $60 billion foreign debt, local newspapers reported Friday.
   However, talks are likely to be contentious, with creditor banks
apparently seeking more than the Argentine government is offering to
pay, the reports stated.
   Citing sources in the Economy Ministry, the daily Clarin reported
the government is prepared to pay $70 million a month for three
months, but creditor banks want a minimum $100 million monthly for
the rest of 1990.
   The daily La Nacion reported foreign bankers don't want monthly
payments at all, but rather a lump sum before negotiations resume.
   The 11-month-old government of President Carlos Menem is seeking
debt forgiveness, approval for debt capitalization and new loans.
Its mission to New York will be led by the president-designate of
the Central Bank, Javier Gonzalez Fraga.
   Fraga told the financial daily El Cronista Comercial that foreign
banks basically want ``interest payments. They have received
virtually nothing in more than two years.''
   Negotiations with a steering committee that represents banks owed
about $40 billion _ mostly U.S. banks _ are likely to be difficult.
The U.S. government in January ordered banks to more than double
their reserves set aside to cover potentially bad loan to Argentina,
cutting into bank earnings.
   Overdue interest may total $8.5 billion this year, the Argentine
government conceded in a letter to the International Monetary Fund
last Friday.
   Nevertheless, the IMF indicated it approved of Menem's policy of
budget austerity and privatizations, and unblocked payment of a $1.7
billion loan. The loan was granted last October but suspended five
months later when the IMF said Menem's government had failed to meet
targets for controlling inflation and reducing the government budget
deficit.
   In the IMF letter, Argentina pledged to pay $500 million in
overdue interest, but acknowledged full payments would not be made
for at least three years.
   Argentina's economy, emerging from two bouts of hyperinflation,
is mired in recession.
   Menem's government has implemented an economic austerity program
that includes budget cuts, the lifting of price controls and plans
for privatization of government-owned companies.

   Stock prices churned ahead to a new high today as
traders responded to fresh evidence of a weaker-than-expected
economy.
   The Labor Department this morning reported a rise of 164,000 in
nonfarm payroll employment during May, attributing the increase
almost entirely to temporary hiring for the Census.
   Job figures for April were revised to show a decrease rather than
the small gain reported earlier.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
said no job growth at all has been registered in the private sector
of the economy over the last three months.
   While that news did not bode well for corporate profits in the
near future, analysts said it was welcomed on Wall Street as a
possible portent of further declines in interest rates and an easing
in the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
   The bond market gave the news an enthusiastic welcome. Prices of
long-term Treasury bonds jumped about $15 for each $1,000 in face
value, lowering their yields to the 8.44 percent-8.47 percent range.

<HEAD>Dutch Electronics Firm Develops Machine For Better-Sounding Audio
Cassettes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dutch electronics company NV Philips has
developed a conventional audio tape process that music industry
officials say is good enough that it could put a dent in the new
digital audio tape market.
   Philips quietly unveiled its new tape machine for several major
record companies in Los Angeles last week. But the company has
declined to discuss the so-called digital compact cassette machine,
which is scheduled to hit the market next year.
   ``It sounds very good; it's not as good as a CD (compact disc),
but it's so much better than standard analog cassettes,'' said Al
McPherson, chief engineer for Warner Bros. Records.
   Philips held the demonstrations to drum up music industry support
for its new product. McPherson said Warner had not agreed to offer
such support, but is very, very interested in the technology.
   Consumers could use the Philips machine to record or play music
utilizing either digital audio tapes or conventional audio tapes.
   The conventional tapes are more widely available and much cheaper
than the digital ones, but the digital tapes' sound quality is far
superior.
   Industry officials have also said the machine could rejuvenate
flagging audio cassette sales. Although the audio cassette developed
by Philips in 1963 represents more than half of all pre-recorded
music sales, sales fell in 1989 in the wake of CD competition.

   Energy futures prices were mixed Friday as the
market sought to stabilize after steep price declines the day before.
   The July contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline was down 0.48
cent to 60.78 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after falling 2.00 cents on Thursday. The August contract was down
0.03 cent to 58.12 cents, while later months increased.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, was up 10 cents to $17.50 a 42-gallon
barrel, after falling 68 cents on Thursday. The August and September
contracts were also up slightly.
   ``We had a nice little bounce back from yesterday's blows,'' said
John Hill, vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``The
traders bought back to cover short positions, evening things up for
the weekend and balancing off from yesterday.''
   Prices tumbled Thursday because of an industry report that
indicated an oversupply of petroleum. The American Petroleum
Institute reported late Wednesday that U.S. inventories of gasoline
and and crude oil rose last week by 1.1 million barrels and 2.1
million barrels respectively.
   Among other futures traded Friday on the New York Merc, the July
contract for home heating oil fell 0.62 cent to 48.73 cents a
gallon. Later heating oil contract months also dropped.
   Natural gas prices were also down. The July contract slipped to
$1.585 per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.590 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Settlement Announced In General Mills-Cholesterol Cereal Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc. has settled a complaint
from attorneys general in three states about advertising for the
defunct Benefit brand cereal, the company said Thursday.
   Minnesota Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III and the attorneys
general in Iowa and Wisconsin alleged that an advertisement claiming
that ``Benefit removes cholesterol from your body'' were false and
misleading.
   Golden Valley-based General Mills said Thursday it agreed to pay
each of the three states $7,000. The settlement is not an admission
of wrongdoing, the company said.
   ``The settlement was the fastest and least costly way to resolve
differences over a single newspaper ad for a product that hasn't
been sold for over five months,'' the company said in a statement.
   General Mills said it took exception with Humphrey's description
of the settlement. He said that under the agreement General Mills
will not make any similar claims that its products ``remove
cholesterol'' from the body.
   Although the Golden Valley based company removed Benefit cereal
from store shelves last winter, Humphrey said, nothing prevented the
company from resurrecting a similar product with the same ``highly
questionable claims.''
   ``These cholesterol claims have gotten out of control,'' said
Humphrey. ``To imply that a single product will magically remove
cholesterol is misleading and deceptive to consumers. It takes an
overall low-fat, low-cholesterol diet to help reduce cholesterol.''
   ``We strongly disagree with his characterization of the
settlement,'' General Mills said.
   Company spokeswoman Kathy Newton said the settlement applies only
to a single newspaper ad printed in August of last year.
   She said the ``interim ad'' featured a PacMan cartoon character
gobbling up the word ``Cholesterol'' in the phrase ``Benefit removes
cholesterol from your body.''
   Humphrey has urged the federal Food and Drug Administration to
ban health claims unless there is scientific consensus that the
claims are true. He also urged the federal agency to spell out the
exact wording that food manufacturers must use in making any health
claims about their products.
   Since Benefit was removed from store shelves, it has been sold as
a food for livestock, Newton said. The company had an inventory of
about 50 tons of the flakes when the product was yanked from the
consumer market.
   It is being used to fatten cows and pigs on several South Dakota
farms, she said.
   ``That is not an uncommon thing whatsoever,'' Newton said. ``If
it's an edible type product we try not to waste it.''

<HEAD>Next Chairman? Lutz and Miller Wait in Chrysler's Wings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leadership shuffle at Chrysler Corp. leaves a
financial whiz and a lover of fast cars waiting in the wings for
Chairman Lee Iacocca's retirement.
   But analysts speculated Friday the differing backgrounds of
``bean counter'' Robert S. Miller and ``car guy'' Robert Lutz may
prompt Iacocca, 65, to stick around past the late-1991 expiration of
his contract.
   The shuffle announced Thursday divided the duties of former Vice
Chairman Gerald Greenwald between Miller, 48, and Lutz, 58.
   Miller got Greenwald's title and most of his duties, but that
doesn't mean he's a shoo-in to succeed Iacocca, analysts said. Since
Miller has had little exposure to product development and Lutz has
had few dealings with financial matters, they said a coordinator is
needed.
   Analysts said that would be Iacocca now that Greenwald has
departed to lead a union coalition seeking a $4.54 billion leveraged
buyout of United Airlines.
   A year ago, it appeared Iacocca would step down as chief
executive officer when his contract expired at the end of 1991 and
hand over Chrysler's reigns to Greenwald. Greenwald has said Iacocca
told him last year that the chairmanship ``is yours to lose.''
   Auto analyst Doug Laughlin of Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York said
the ``bad news'' resulting from Greenwald's resignation was ``who is
the long-term chairman for Chrysler.''
   ``The good news is that Iacocca stays around longer either to
groom or find a successor,'' he said.
   Chrysler moved swiftly in the hours after Greenwald's resignation
was announced. In addition to dividing Greenwald's duties between
Miller and Lutz, it eliminated the Office of the Chairman, which
Iacocca and Greenwald shared.
   Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell, 62, who's reportedly
suffering health problems, was passed over in the shuffle,
presumably leaving him out of the running for chairman. The Detroit
Free Press quoted unidentified sources Friday as saying Bidwell
plans to retire in December. Company spokesmen declined to discuss
Bidwell's intentions or his health.
   That leaves Lutz and Miller on deck. Auto analyst David Healy of
Barclays Bank in New York called both highly able in their chosen
fields.
   Healy and other analysts said it's difficult to tell who's in
line for Iacocca's job, partly because Chrysler has done some
innovative things with its corporate offices.
   Among the scenarios analysts suggested:
   _An outsider could be brought in, much like Iacocca was in 1979.
   _Lutz or Miller could become the new chairman after some grooming.
   _Miller and Lutz could share the office.
   ``It's possible to split it up where they both would wind up with
big titles and each guy would handle his traditional area,'' Healy
said. ``Chrysler has had so many variations on its structure that
nothing would surprise me.''
   Miller joined Chrysler in 1979 as assistant controller. With
Greenwald, he helped secure loans and federal guarantees which
helped the automaker avoid bankruptcy in the early 1980s.
   Like Iacocca, Lutz and Bidwell, Miller worked for Ford Motor Co.
before going to Chrysler, mostly in overseas financial operations.
   At Chrysler, Miller became vice president and treasurer in 1980,
and rose to become the corporation's chief financial officer in
1988. He also is credited with raising money and developing a
financial plan that rescued the Detroit Symphony last year.
   Lutz, born in Zurich, Switzerland, started his automotive career
with General Motors Corp. in 1963 and worked in a number of
administrative jobs in Europe. He then spent three years with the
West German automaker BMW before joining Ford of Europe in 1974.
   He worked for Ford for a dozen years, before joining Chrysler in
1986 as an executive vice president. Lutz is known for his love of
cars, especially driving them fast.
   Stories about Lutz's love of speed are popular in Detroit. One
goes that he likes a strip of highway close to his Ann Arbor home
because a wall between traffic lanes hides his Lamborghini Countach
from the State Police as he roars to work at Chrysler's Highland
Park headquarters.

   High-level talks on increasing access of U.S.
automobile parts suppliers to Japanese markets will be held June 14
in Louisville, Ky., the Commerce Department said Thursday.
   The negotiations will be headed by Commerce Undersecretary J.
Michael Farren and Naomichi Suzuki, Japanese vice minister of
international trade and industry.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher and Japanese International
Trade and Industry Minister Kabun Muto agreed in April to raise the
level of the talks.
   Known as the Market Oriented Sector Selective, they are designed
to accelerate progress on increasing U.S. suppliers' access to the
Japanese auto market and to ensure greater involvement of U.S.
suppliers in the design phase of Japanese car manufacturers.
   U.S. auto parts exports to Japan now total about $600 million a
year, less than 1 percent of the Japanese auto parts market.

<TEXT>
   The hiring of thousands of temporary census
workers helped push the nation's unemployment rate down slightly to
5.3 percent in May, the government said Friday.
   Despite the 0.1 percentage point decline in the jobless rate,
analysts viewed the report as a sign of a sluggish economy because
private sector job growth slowed to a near standstill in May.
   ``These numbers are a real danger signal ... and bring into
question whether we can muddle through without tilting toward
recession,'' economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. said.
   The report, the first comprehensive look at May's economic
activity, shows the economy is ``worse than sluggish _ it is
moribund,'' said Richard W. Rahn, chief economist at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce.
   Stock prices on Wall Street rose to a new high as traders took
weak job growth as a sign that the Federal Reserve might lower
interest rates. At the close, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials was 2,900.97, up 24.31 from Thursday.
   In other economic news Friday, the Commerce Department reported
construction spending continued to slide in April, dropping 0.7
percent for the second straight month as interest rates remained
high.
   The civilian jobless rate as measured by a household survey fell
slightly in May from April's 5.4 percent unemployment rate, the
Labor Department said. The nation's jobless rate has been
fluctuating around 5.3 percent for more than a year.
   There were 164,000 new jobs created last month, according to a
separate survey of business establishments, but the number was
artificially inflated by the federal government's hiring of 145,000
temporary census workers.
   Revised figures for April showed jobs actually declined by 23,000
that month rather than posting a small increase as the Labor
Department had earlier reported.
   ``The job market has been bolstered only by census hiring. The
private sector has been stagnant for the past three months,'' said
Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Since February, the economy has added just 264,000 new jobs and
if government jobs are excluded, private payrolls actually fell by
105,000, the government said.
   ``Job creation has ground to a halt increasingly in one industry
after another,'' said economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co.
   Analysts said the unemployment dip was also helped by the
relatively slow expansion of the labor force in recent months.
   After growing by 430,000 workers in February and March, the
number of Americans working or actively seeking jobs grew by just
165,000 during April and May.
   The nation's manufacturing sector, which has been in a slump for
months, continued to falter as factory jobs fell by 35,000 jobs,
bringing the total manufacturing losses to 310,000 jobs since March
1989. The electrical equipment, auto and apparel industries together
have lost 190,000 jobs during that period.
   Construction jobs fell by 20,000 in May, reflecting continued
weakness in the housing market, the government said. Employment in
the construction industry is only 30,000 above its level of a year
earlier, compared with a 180,000 gain in the prior May-to-May period.
   The service sector, which has been carrying the economy, added
216,000 jobs, but that included the once-every-decade census jobs.
Health services added 47,000 jobs, wholesale trade contributed
16,000 and business services added another 15,000 jobs.
   In contrast, other industries within the service sector are
slumping. Retail trade has posted a 19,000-job loss since January
while finance, insurance and real estate has added just 28,000 jobs
over the past five months.
   Average hourly earnings posted a 0.4 percent rise in May to
$9.99, up from the $9.95 the average worker earned an hour in April.
If earnings rose at that pace every month, that would mean a 5
percent annual increase.
   Jones called the higher wage costs, coupled with slow job growth,
``the worst of both possible worlds.''
   ``It's certainly going to put a squeeze on corporate profits,''
he said.
   The average manufacturing work week rose to 41.1 hours in May, up
from 40.7 hours in April. Manufacturing overtime increased to 4
hours, up from the average of 3.5 hours in April.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed serviced stationed in the United States, the May jobless
rate was 5.3 percent, the same as April and also May's civilian rate.

losing ground to the Japanese yen and British pound in domestic
trading.
   The dollar's strength versus several key currencies tended to
depress precious metals. Gold bullion prices declined in the United
States and abroad.
   A widely awaited report on the U.S. labor market in May initially
had a negative impact on the dollar.
   The report, the first comprehensive look at last month's economic
activity, signaled continuing sluggish growth. It also implied that
inflationary pressures aren't as powerful as previously thought,
which drove down interest rates in the bond market Friday.
   Falling U.S. interest rates reduce returns on dollar-denominated
holdings and can curb demand for dollars.
   The unemployment rate dipped to 5.3 percent in May from April's
5.4 percent and non-farm payrolls expanded by an unexpectedly small
number. There were 164,000 new jobs created last month at business
establishments, but the figure was inflated by the federal
government's hiring of 145,000 temporary census workers.
   Sales of other currencies to collect profits amassed during
recent advances helped the dollar recover from its lows of the day.
   Lingering concerns about various international matters also
benefited the dollar. Confidence in the West German currency has
been eroded by speculation that German unification could undermine
the mark's value.
   Scott Hinton, currency analyst at Elders Futures Inc. in New
York, said trading was heavy after release of the unemployment
report in early U.S. trading. But it slowed considerably by midday,
which is typical for a Friday.
   Currency dealers usually refrain from establishing significant
new positions on Fridays because events over the weekend might have
an impact on exchange rates.
   The dollar's performance against the Japanese yen was mixed. In
Tokyo, the dollar closed at 152.17 yen, up 0.42 yen from Thursday's
close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 151.45 yen. It was
quoted at 151.85 yen near the end of New York trading, down from
152.10 late Thursday.
   The British pound rose to $1.6840 in London from $1.6760 late
Thursday. Sterling rose to $1.6810 from $1.6780 late Thursday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late quotes, included: 1.6985 West German marks, up from 1.6965;
1.4375 Swiss francs, up from 1.4290; 5.7295 French francs, up from
5.724; 1,250.375 Italian lire, up from 1,248.25; and 1.17465
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17285.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
levels, included: 1.6940 West German marks, down from 1.6990; 1.4358
Swiss francs, up from 1.4325; 5.7180 French francs, down from
5.7300; 1.9073 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9060; 1,247.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,247.00; and 1.1728 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1740.
   Gold and silver prices weakened.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
June delivery tumbled $5.10 to close at $359.20. Republic National
Bank quoted a late bid of $358.75 a troy ounce for gold bullion,
$4.95 lower than Thursday.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid of $361.25 a troy ounce from
$363.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of
$363.00 from $364.00 late Thursday. Gold in Hong Kong dropped 21
cents to close at $365.04.
   Silver for June delivery dropped to $5.046 a troy ounce on New
York's Comex from $5.074 Thursday. In London, silver fell to a late
bid of $5.05 a troy ounce from $5.08 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Futures Plunge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures plunged Friday on the New York Commodity
Exchange in the wake of weak May employment figures and amid
uncertainty about whether a trade agreement will result from
U.S.-Soviet summit talks.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures fell; livestock and
pork futures were higher, and energy futures were mixed.
   Peter Caudillo, an analyst with Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York,
said that the precious metals market was monitoring the progress of
talks between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
in Washington, D.C.
   ``If nothing positive comes of out of the summit, there are fears
the Soviets will be forced again to sell gold in the open market''
to pay for overseas purchases, Caudillo said.
   He noted that gold has not been able to rally since mid-May, when
heavy cash market selling of the metal sent prices tumbling.
   The U.S. Labor Department announced Friday that the nation's
unemployment rate went fell 0.1 percenttage point to 5.3 percent in
May while job growth amounted to a smaller-than-expected 164,000.
   ``The figures are indicating economic weakness, translating into
a downward trend in inflation,'' he said.
   Gold is seen as a haven during inflationary periods.
   Silver futures were battered by gold's plunge, with the day's
gains erased when investors liquidated near-month contracts.
   Gold settled $5.10 to $5.80 lower with the contract for delivery
in June at $359.20 a troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents to 4.4 cents
lower with June at $5.046 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade as improving weather depressed prices.
   Soybeans dropped sharply when the July support level of $6.05 a
bushel was breached and followthrough selling set in.
   National Weather Service forecasts called for dry conditions much
of next week, which will facilitate planting of soybeans, said
William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   Soybean plantings had been delayed by soggy fields.
   Corn futures were pushed lower by progress made this week in
planting the corn crop.
   Biedermann noted that sparce export business and a lack of
progress in trade talks during the Bush-Gorbachev summit talks
influenced corn futures.
   Fairly good weather, allowing for progress in the harvesting of
the winter crop, pushed wheat futures lower.
   Wheat was 1 cent to 4{ cents lower with July at $3.29\ a bushel;
corn was 1} cents to 2\ cents lower with July at $2.75} a bushel;
oats were a { cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at $1.44 a
bushel; soybeans were 5\ cents to 7{ cents lower with July at $6.02
a bushel.
   Energy futures were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The near-month contract for crude oil bounced back from
Thursday's sharp selloff on belief that the drop was overdone,
analysts said.
   Gasoline, while slightly higher, continued to be pressured from
American Petroleum Institute inventory figures showing refinery runs
increased sharply last month, while gasoline stocks also rose.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 10 cents lower to 10 cents
higher with July at $17.50 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to .78
cent lower with July at 48.73 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.48 cent lower to .15 cent higher with July at 60.78 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .17 cent to .52 cent higher with June at 74.47
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .72 cent higher with
August at 84.37 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower to .25
cent higher with June at 65.75 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .85 cent to 1.42 cents higher with July at 65.05 cents a pound.

   Last year it was hand-held video games, watchable
Walkmans and interactive compact discs. This year, it's digital
audio tape, scaled-down camcorders and movie-theater sound for the
home.
   Every year, millions of dollars in new electronics technology
goes on display at the Consumer Electronics Show, but what does it
mean for someone who bought last year's innovation and now faces
bewildering new choices?
   ``Products will continue to be put out with new features and new
bells and whistles,'' acknowledged Marvin Lurie, spokesman for the
suburban Lombard-based National Association of Retail Dealers of
America.
   ``The only way to get it sorted out is to go to a qualified
dealer who can explain the benefits,'' Lurie said Friday. He said
his group represents about 20 percent of U.S. consumer electronics
retailers.
   Many of them will be among the estimated 55,000 visitors to the
annual show, beginning Saturday at McCormick Place, where 1,400
manufacturers will be showing tens of thousands of products for four
days in an area equivalent to the size of 17 football fields.
   ``We are THE industry show,'' said Tom Lauterback, spokesman for
the Consumer Electronics Group of the Washington-based Electronics
Industries Association, sponsor of the June show in Chicago and a
similar January show in Las Vegas. The shows are closed to the
public.
   Consumer electronics, a $44 billion-a-year industry that includes
audio, video, home office and home-automation products, has slowed
to ``single-digit'' growth, but ``I suppose every industry would
love to be able to say that,'' Lauterback said Friday.
   Unlike in past years, ``we don't have on hand a product that
everyone is going to want but no one has,'' said Lurie.
   ``Digital audio tape might be that, except that if it comes on
the market later this year, it's not going to come at a mass-market
price,'' he said, adding that DAT systems are expected to retail at
$1,000 to $1,200.
   Though DAT technology has existed for years, it wasn't until
Wednesday that a Japanese government agency announced new technology
standards that will open that country's market for DAT players.
   The players can make nearly perfect copies of prerecorded music,
but manufacturers have held off marketing them out of a fear of
lawsuits from copyright disputes.
   Japan's new standards are designed to limit consumers' abilities
to make new copies, and Congress is scheduled to hold hearings this
month on a proposal to adopt similar standards in the United States.
   Political problems similarly plague high-resolution television,
said Don Krueger, senior vice president and director of research for
Sanyo Securities of America, the U.S. arm of one of Japan's biggest
brokerage firms.
   ``The Japanese have the standard of technology, but Europe and
the U.S. don't want to adopt the standard,'' he said in a telephone
interview Friday.
   ``Nobody wants the Japanese to dominate the high-definition TV''
as they have other areas of the consumer electronics market, he said.
   Meanwhile, ``there's nothing terribly exciting out there ..., ''
he said. ``We've kind of hit a black hole right now.''
   Hence, improvements to existing products are holding sway at this
year's show, including ultra-compact camcorders _ the size of half a
cigarette carton _ marketed by Panasonic and Sony and a
movie-theater sound system for the home marketed by Lucasfilm Ltd.
   In the video game arena, disabled youngsters will get a shot at
Nintendo action through a voice-command headset unveiled by Konami
Inc. of suburban Buffalo Grove.
   The proliferation of consumer electronics products overall may
sometimes seem bewildering, but it is an inevitable byproduct of the
American way of doing business, said sociologist Peter Whalley, an
associate professor at Loyola University who teachs a course on
technology and society.
   ``The standard marketing strategy is to maximize the number of
products out there to fill the niches out there,'' he said Friday.
``I don't think the electronics industry does it more than anyone
else.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Soar On News Of Weaker Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices soared Friday as the market reacted
to sharply weaker-than-expected job growth in May that pointed to an
economic slowdown.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond jumped 1{ points, or $15
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall,
tumbled to 8.44 percent from 8.57 percent late Thursday.
   It was the lowest yield on the 30-year bond since late March.
   The government reported that the nation's unemployment rate fell
0.1 percentage point to 5.3 percent in May, but that only 19,000
jobs, excluding temporary census workers, were created.
   Steven A. Wood, an economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets in
San Francisco, said the report ``suggests the economy is performing
much more weakly than expected, and that will lead to lower
inflation and an easing of monetary policy.''
   Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as
bonds. An easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board
would lower interest rates, which would benefit bond prices.
   ``The Fed has been concerned, as have the markets, that the
economy has been growing too rapidly to allow inflationary pressures
to recede,'' Wood said. ``Now it appears the economy is not growing
nearly as strongly.''
   The Labor Department said the number of new jobs in May increased
by 164,000 over April, but that number was artificially bolstered by
the federal government's hiring of 145,000 temporary census workers.
Private economists had expected non-government industries to add at
least 125,00 jobs in May, far above the 19,000 reported.
   Wood said the market took off slowly after the report was issued,
rising on light volume before heavy trading began in all maturities.
   In another economic report Friday, a survey of the nation's
purchasing managers indicated that U.S. manufacturing expanded in
May for the second straight month.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management's economic
index rose to 50.7 percent in May, from 50.2 percent in April. A
reading above 50 indicates the manufacturing economy is generally
expanding; below 50, that it is generally declining.
   Tom Lanier, a Treasury bill trader with Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., said the bond market had little reaction to the report
since it was little changed from April.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were up from 5-16 point to | point, intermediate
maturities jumped from 23-32 point to 1 5-16 points, and long-term
issues climbed as much as 1{ points, according to Telerate Inc., the
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, gained 7.89 to 1,160.22.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose to 91 11-16 from 91 12-32 late Thursday.
The average yield to maturity dropped to 7.50 percent from 7.53
percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.94 percent as the
discount dropped 6 basis points to 7.69 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were down to 8.01 percent as the discount was off 12 basis
points to 7.61 percent. Yields on one-year bills issued at auction
Thursday were down to 8.04 percent as the discount was down 16 basis
points to 7.49 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other
on overnight loans, was quoted at 8\ percent, unchanged from late
Thursday.

   The hiring of thousands of temporary census
workers helped push the nation's unemployment rate down slightly to
5.3 percent in May, the government said.
   The civilian jobless rate fell slightly in May from April's 5.4
percent rate, the Labor Department said Friday. But analysts viewed
the report as a sign of a sluggish economy because private sector
job growth slowed to a near standstill.
   There were 164,000 new jobs created last month, according to a
separate survey of business establishments, but the number was
artificially inflated by the federal government's hiring of 145,000

   Two judges supervising hundreds of asbestos
injury lawsuits ordered the Manville Corp. bankruptcy case reopened
to overhaul a financially ailing trust fund designed to compensate
victims of asbestos-related diseases.
   In a joint order, a federal judge and a New York state judge on
Friday said the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust was out of
money and suggested the company advance it $200 million to $300
million so it can resume payments to victims.
   The trust was formed in Manville's 1988 reorganization, six years
after it was driven into bankruptcy court by lawsuits over
production of asbestos, the insulation and building material found
to cause severe and sometimes fatal illnesses.

   The price of L.A. Gear Inc. stock fell nearly
22 percent Friday after the company said it expected its earnings
for the current quarter would be down sharply from a year ago.
   L.A. Gear stock fell $8.50 per share to close at $30.50 on the
New York Stock Exchange _ down nearly 40 percent from its high of
$50.37{ on May 24.
   Most of Friday's decline came after the sneakers and apparel
maker said at midafternoon that it expected to report quarterly
earnings of 50 to 60 cents per share in the March-May quarter
compared with 90 cents per share a year earlier. The forecast
surprised many Wall Street analysts.
   ``The earnings the company indicated were considerably lower than
we had indicated,'' said Jay J. Meltzer, a Goldman Sachs analyst in
New York.
   But Meltzer said the earnings report alone could not account for
the precipitous stock fall. He had no other explanation for it,
however.
   Dick Broderick, an outside publicist for the company, was in a
meeting and could not immediately be reached for comment, his office
reported.
   L.A. Gear's profit more than doubled last year, reaching $55
million.
   The company's stock had surged last week, in part because the
Salomon Brothers brokerage had repeated a buy recommendation.
Salomon Brothers analyst Heidi R. Steinberg said she could not
account for Friday's fall.
   L.A. Gear, known for trendy shoes and signing celebrity endorsers
like Michael Jackson, Joe Montana and Paula Abdul to
multimillion-dollar contracts, was a go-go company for the past two
years, with booming sales moving it up into the No. 3 spot behind
Nike Inc. and Reebok International Ltd.
   Many investors made big profits, while others found it ``a stock
they loved to hate'' and the share price has whipsawed, said Donald
L. Wampach, who follows emerging growth stocks for Hamilton
Investments Inc. in Chicago.
   Wampach noted that ``short sellers'' who bet the stock price will
fall had frequently gotten burned on L.A. Gear shares.
   He said he believes the company is undergoing a difficult change
into an established, medium-size outfit, but remains fundamentally
strong. The earnings decline is probably attributable to the
transition from older shoe models to new Michael Jackson, hiking and
back-to-school lines, he said.
   ``The Street sure didn't anticipate the word on the earnings,
though,'' Wampach said.

<HEAD>NBC Criticizes Nielsen Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC, joining in the ABC and CBS challenge of the
Nielsen ``people-meter'' ratings system, said Friday it is
``seriously concerned'' about the system's value to the industry.
   The A.C. Nielsen Co. promptly fired back, saying in a statement
it had investigated the system's reports of decreasing levels of
network viewing and ``we feel it's a real decline.''
   The people-meters, the industry ratings standard since the fall
of 1987, are viewer-activated devices that record what shows are
being watched and which members of a participating family are
watching.
   The networks contend that the people-meter figures under-count
the real audience, and that the system, which is in 4,000 homes, is
flawed.
   ABC on Thursday fired the first round against the system, saying
it would use its own formula of ratings analysis to determine if it
should give ``make-goods'' to advertisers of ABC shows that get
ratings lower than ABC had promised.
   Make-goods are commercial slots given free to businesses when
their ads air on shows with less-than-expected ratings. Ads are sold
on the basis of the network's prediction of the size and makeup of
the audience.
   NBC, in a statement Friday, said it was troubled by what it
called ``the unexplained aberrations in the Nielsen people meter
ratings,'' and said it was taking a close look at ABC's plan and
other possibilities.
   However, it also said such steps are ``only interim solutions to
the problem'' and called for networks and advertisers alike to work
for ``a viable system that would eliminate concerns about accuracy
and reliability.''
   CBS research vice president David Poltrack, who has been a strong
critic of the people-meter methodology, said in an interview that
the network ``has not yet reviewed all the options'' it may have in
the dispute.
   It probably will start the review Monday, he said, ``and start
looking at the (advertising) industry reactions'' to ABC's plan.
   He also said he felt that the people-meter system's ``deficiences
and instability make it an unreliable tool for television audience
measurement.''
   ``We feel the people-meter system is not responsible for the
(viewing) decline, and it's the buyers of advertising time who
ultimately will decide the validity of each network's proposal,''
said Nielsen spokeswoman Jo LaVerde.
   Several advertising agency executives panned the ABC plan, and
came to the defense of the Nielsen rarings system.
   Steve Sternberg, manager of broadcast research at the ad agency
Bozell Inc., said his agency feels the decline in TV audiences
evident in the Nielsen ratings are genuine rather than due to faults
in the measurement system.
   The ABC plan to base audience guarantees on a three-year average
rather than the upcoming season's actual results ``is a blatant
attempt to lock advertisers into historical viewing levels,
favorable to ABC _ in the face of deteriorating network viewing,''
Kevin Burns and John Hunt of the ad agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather wrote in
a commentary on the ABC plan.
   They said the audience guarantees were enacted to protect
advertisers in return for making a sizeable long-term commitment.
   ``In effect, the ABC proposal would provide a gurantee for the
network rather than the advertiser. Despite the current turmoil in
the medium, we don't believe it is the advertisers' responsibility
to guarantee the networks a profit,'' they wrote.
   Richard Kostyra, media services director at the J. Walter
Thompson ad agency, said the ABC plan could ``move a lot of money
into Fox'' which has said it would give the normal guarantees on
sales on its network.
   He said it would also encourage advertisers to spend more to
advertise on cable television, syndicated shows and alternative
media outlets such as those aimed at reaching women in doctor's
offices or beauty parlors and shoppers in the supermarket checkout
lines.
   Paul Schulman, who heads an ad buying service that carries his
name, said the guarantees are only one of the items to be negotiated
on buying ad time.
   ``This isn't the key to the whole negotiations. We have to see
what kind of price increasaes they are seeking,'' he said.
