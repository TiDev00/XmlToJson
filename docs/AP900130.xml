   The Associated Press erroneously reported
Jan. 30 that New York Mets outfielder Darryl Strawberry was charged
with assault with a deadly weapon after allegedly threatening his
wife with a pistol.
   Strawberry was arrested Jan. 26 in connection with the alleged
incident and spent a short time in jail before he was released on
$12,000 bail.
   Los Angeles police erroneously told the AP that felony charges
had already been filed against Strawberry.
   The district attorney's office, however, did not review the case
until Tuesday and decided there was insufficient evidence for
felony charges, though lesser charges could still be filed.

   In the days after Hurricane Hugo smashed
into South Carolina, people needed ice, food and clothing. Later,
they needed carpenters and building supplies.
   Now, many coastal residents find they need a good lawyer.
   In the wake of disputes over rental agreements, insurance
payments and building repairs, South Carolina's judicial system is
bracing for an expected influx of cases stemming from the killer
hurricane.
   And with the courts already overburdened by a backlog of
criminal cases, there is concern that Hugo-related cases will
further bog down the system.
   ``Somebody is bound to not be happy out there,'' said Louis
Rosen, director of the state Office of Court Administration. ``It's
one of those factors that will make a bad situation worse.''
   Hugo, which came ashore at Charleston on Sept. 21, caused an
estimated $5.9 billion in property damage, making it the most
damaging hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland. The storm was blamed
for 29 deaths in South Carolina alone.
   ``We're speculating that a storm with that extent of damage will
raise construction disputes and insurance disputes,'' said Rosen,
whose office oversees the flow of litigation through the court
system.
   But the Hugo cases will not really have an impact before summer,
he said.
   ``You have to look a year after the fact,'' Rosen explained.
``Even after a person thinks he may be engaged in a legal dispute,
it takes some time to consult an attorney and look into it.''
   People with small claims will probably end up in magistrate
courts, which can handle cases involving amounts of less than
$2,500, Rosen said.
   But bigger cases _ insurance settlements and contracting
disputes _ will probably be more complicated and have to be settled
in common pleas courts.
   In the days after the storm, the South Carolina Bar offered free
legal advice at the Disaster Assistance Centers established by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Volunteer attorneys fielded thousands of calls and questions,
although there is no estimate on how many people received legal
advice, said Eve Stacey of the bar staff.
   But the questions raised may give an indication of the types of
lawsuits that may follow.
   Among the questions were concerns about landlord-tenant
relations, damage caused by trees and structures from an adjoining
property, houses washed across property and insurance disputes over
what was flood damage and what was wind damage.
   ``I can see a lot of those as potential actions,'' Ms. Stacey
said in a recent interview.
   Many disputes over what a tenant was liable to pay when his or
her home was damaged in the storm have already been addressed in
magistrate courts, said Donna Taylor, an attorney with Neighborhood
Legal Services in Charleston.
   ``They were handled at the magistrate's level and were handled
right then,'' she said. ``It was one of the times when the system
operated well. If we had to wait to go to circuit court, people
would have been homeless or penniless.''
   Down the road, she said, ``The courts are going to be flooded
with suits stemming from insurance claims _ the insurers' failure
to pay the extent of the policy.
   ``There will also be a lot of lawsuits against contractors _
these young guys who came in from out of state and said, `I can fix
your roof if you give me your two grand.'''
   Meanwhile, the South Carolina Coastal Council has been named in
at least 12 lawsuits stemming from the hurricane. All concern pools
and seawalls in beachfront areas where the council has determined
that structures may not be rebuilt, council spokeswoman Donna Gress
said.
   A circuit judge ruled last week in eight of those cases that
property owners may rebuild seawalls and pools. But he required a
$10,000 bond in case his decision is overturned by a higher court
and the structures must be removed.

<TEXT>
   Newly disclosed documents offer an
unflattering portrait of an official state segregation agency that
spied on Jewish children and investigated a black dentist at a
white dentist's request.
   The 17-year evolution of the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission
was chronicled Sunday in The Jackson Clarion-Ledger, which obtained
more than 700 sealed commission documents.
   The activities of the spy agency, created in 1956 to preserve
Mississippi's segregated society, previously had been part of the
state's secret past. The files show that:
   _ Hundreds of people, including teachers, preachers and
students, were investigated for alleged civil rights leanings and
``subversive'' activities. Some lost their jobs.
   _ Dozens more, including a prominent black Delta educator who
later had a school named for him, were spies for the commission.
They helped gather incriminating information and infiltrated
various organizations and groups.
   _ U.S. Sen. James O. Eastland turned over to the commission the
names of some of his constituents who supported civil rights. He
also used his position as chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee to help the commission link Tougaloo College President
A.D. Beittel and others to communism.
   _ The Clarion-Ledger and Jackson Daily News regularly killed
news stories or ran propaganda at the commission's request.
   _ A black militant group was suspected of plotting to release a
lethal gas in a Jackson building. The commission secretly aided the
FBI in the case.
   _ The commission in 1964 planted a story in Mississippi's
largest black newspaper to publicize claims that the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. was linked to the Communist Party.
   Holding the line between blacks and whites was the commission's
goal when it was created by the 1956 Legislature. The commission's
influence withered during the 1960s, and Gov. Bill Waller
eliminated its funding in 1973.
   The 1977 Legislature abolished the commission and ordered its
files sealed until 2027 to protect those named in the documents.
   A U.S. District Court case that would open the files is on
appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
   The Clarion-Ledger did not say how it obtained the files.
Executive Editor John D. Johnson said Monday that the newspaper
would not disclose the source of the documents.
   Commission files at one time contained the names of 250
organizations and 10,000 people, according to a document in the
files. However, not all were considered ``leftist or subversive,''
the documents say.
   In December 1960, the commission spied on 300 Jewish teen-agers
attending a five-state B'nai B'rith youth meeting at a motel in
Biloxi.
   ``These youths sang songs and a general party atmosphere
prevailed,'' a commission investigator wrote. ``We observed them
and listened to them, but we could observe nothing or hear nothing
that indicated that they were advocating subversion, integration or
anything of a communistic nature.''
   In 1969, the commission investigated Presley Autry, a black
Holly Springs dentist who was seeking admission to the Mississippi
Dental Association. The investigation was conducted at the request
of a white Greenwood dentist, Arthur Richter, according to the
files.
   Richter said he had received unconfirmed reports that Autry
participated in civil rights activities, and believed he wasn't ``a
desirable candidate'' for the dental association, a commission memo
says.
   The investigation uncovered nothing to support the unconfirmed
reports. Richter was given the result and asked to hold it in
strict confidence.
   ``I felt that the interest of a matter of this nature to the
public would give us the authority to check it out, although it
would not come under the category of a tax-supported matter,'' a
commission director wrote.
   Autry, 61, who retired in 1986 and lives in Houston, said he was
admitted to the association without any problem. Richter recently
said he didn't remember much about the case.
   A January 1964 report contains some insight into the
commission's philosophy. In it, state Sen. George Yarbrough asked
commission investigator Tom Scarbrough about integrating the Holly
Springs public library. Both men have since died.
   Scarbrough wrote: ``I told Sen. Yarbrough at the time that it
was my thinking that when the City Board made concessions to a
group of Negroes, other demands would follow from the same group
and as far as I was personally concerned, I felt that we should
hold fast our way of life until forced to retreat.''

   Two lost skiers decided they had money
to burn, and the decision may have saved their lives.
   Don Wing and Jack Joneson, both 29 and from Calgary, Alberta,
strayed out of bounds at The Big Mountain ski resort Saturday
afternoon and got lost, Flathead County Sheriff Chuck Rhodes said
Monday.
   More than 30 searchers set out in waist-deep snow shortly after
dark to find them.
   The skiers were found about 11:30 p.m., snug and warm beside the
campfire they had started eight hours earlier _ by burning dollar
bills, Rhodes said.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Monday ruled
unconstitutional an order barring the television program ``Inside
Edition'' from broadcasting scenes filmed with a hidden camera in a
doctor's office.
   Judge Boyce F. Martin Jr. of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ordered U.S. District Judge Barbara K. Hackett of Detroit
to lift her Jan. 18 restraining order, which had prevented the
syndicated program from using the film shot in the New York office
of Dr. Stuart M. Berger.
   Martin ruled that Ms. Hackett's order violated the
constitutional guarantee of press freedom despite Berger's argument
before Hackett that showing the tape would invade his privacy and
damage his reputation.
   ``Berger simply has not shown the type of irreparable harm that
can justify a prior restraint,'' Martin's order said.
   ``Inside Edition'' spokeswoman Marcy Baron said the program
plans to include the scenes shot in Berger's office in a segment
about him which is to be shown Thursday.
   Berger's attorney, Russell Ethridge, filed a request that Martin
delay his order to give the doctor's attorneys time to appeal the
ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``Once that footage is broadcast, the images cannot be recalled,
and the damage cannot be undone,'' Ethridge said in his request.
   ``We're disappointed that the court didn't see the distinction
we see between defamation cases ... and invasion of privacy,''
Ethridge said by telephone from Detroit.
   He said Berger's attorneys plan to press his claim for $10
million in damages from the show.
   ``Inside Edition'' producer Amy Wasserstrom said in an affidavit
that she videotaped two visits she made as a patient to Berger's
office while preparing a story on controversy surrounding the
doctor's medical conduct. Berger is the author of several widely
sold diet books.
   Ms. Wasserstrom said Berger diagnosed her as suffering from an
allergy to yeast and chronic fatigue. However, another doctor said
she didn't have such ailments.
   ``We believe that the reporter did nothing wrong,'' said Russell
Smith, an attorney for King World Productions, Inc., which produces
``Inside Edition.''
   ``She told him of her condition truthfully, and he misdiagnosed
her, ripped her off, and caused her stress,'' Smith said. ``If
there was any misconduct here, it was by Dr. Berger.''

   Babe Ruth's daughters struck out in federal
court when an appeals court ruled that a publisher did not infringe
on their trademark by using pictures of the Bambino in a calendar.
   Three judges of the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a
lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by Julia Ruth Stevens
and Dorothy Ruth Pirone, who has since died, and against Macmillan
Inc.
   After Ruth's death, the sisters registered the words ``Babe
Ruth'' as a trademark for playing cards and other uses.
   The court said the trademark did not apply to photographs of
Ruth.
   The calendar, ``The 1988 Macmillan Baseball Engagement
Calendar,'' contained three references to Ruth. The cover was a
photograph of Ruth helping a boy with his batting grip; a week in
October was illustrated with a picture of Ruth saluting General
John Pershing; and a page in the December section had a photograph
of a baseball autographed by Ruth.

   Most of the 190 paintings willed to the
Spanish state by surrealist artist Salvador Dali are to remain in
his native Catalonia under a newly signed agreement that ends a
year of bickering.
   Dali's will was made public shortly before his Jan. 23, 1989
death at age 84, but it was not until Monday that agreement was
reached on where the works he willed to the state will be put on
display.
   Culture Minister Jorge Semprun and Catalonian Culture
Commissioner Joan Guitart signed the pact.
   Under its terms, the Reina Sofia art center in Madrid is to
display ``The Great Masturbator,'' considered one of the flamboyant
painter's greatest works and reportedly one of the last sticking
points of the talks.
   Another 55 paintings are also to be on display in the Reina
Sofia art center and the remaining 134 are to be kept in the
building housing Dali's Theater-Museum in Figueras, where he lived
his last years confined to a wheelchair.
   In addition to the 190 paintings, the moustachioed artist's
estate includes two castles, 500 sculptures and other Dali-designed
objects, and hundreds of signed prints.
   Government officials in Catalonia and Figueras had complained
publicly after Dali's death when they found they were not
specifically named as beneficiaries in the will.
   Press reports at the time of Dali's death said his estate was
worth up to $90.1 million. But its real value is difficult to
determine because of the erratic prices of 20th century art and the
existence of numerous forgeries.

   President F.W. de Klerk has
ignited hope that the white government is finally ready to
dismantle apartheid and sit down with black leaders to find a
solution to South Africa's problems.
   But there is little sign that de Klerk is about to surrender
power or that white rule is in any danger of collapsing even though
the president's stated aim is to end apartheid. There are still no
signs that the government will accept full democracy _ the main
demand of all anti-apartheid groups.
   De Klerk is expected to outline his plans in a speech Friday at
the opening of Parliament. Many South Africans are hoping the
speech will be the signal for historic reform, despite official
warnings not to expect too much.
   Some political observers say the quest for peace in South Africa
is more like the confrontations in Northern Ireland or the Middle
East. There is little chance, they say, that white rule will come
crashing down overnight like the Berlin Wall and the Communist
regimes of Eastern Europe.
   The government is in full control of the country, unrest is
minimal and the African National Congress, the main black
opposition group, admits its military campaign against the
government poses little threat at this point.
   De Klerk, who says he wants a ``new dispensation'' that will
give South African blacks a role in the country's affairs, still
rejects any suggestion of majority rule.
   There also are few signs that many white South Africans are
ready to share their schools, hospitals and other public facilities
with non-whites or share power and opportunity on an equal basis
with non-whites.
   Many observers say de Klerk lacks a definite plan and is feeling
his way, playing for time with limited reforms in the hope of
finding a solution that will avoid major confrontation and still
preserve a special role for whites.
   De Klerk has given no specific signs of what he wants for South
Africa's future beyond stressing that whites must have veto power
in any future state.
   Black leaders say de Klerk must meet a number of basic
expectations to clear the way for talks with the African National
Congress, including lifting the state of emergency; releasing ANC
leader Nelson Mandela; removing the ban on the ANC and other
outlawed opposition groups, and allowing exiled black leaders to
return to South Africa.
   How far he goes towards meeting these conditions Friday will be
a good indication of how much reform the government wants. Even if
de Klerk meets all the conditions, it will only be the start of
what promises to be a very long and difficult search for peace.
   Skeptics point out that de Klerk as leader of the National Party
is head of South Africa's Afrikaners, whites of Dutch descent who
dominate the government and who have been sustained by a belief in
their superiority for three centuries.
   Because of deeply ingrained beliefs of white superiority and
rule, neither de Klerk nor his people can give up power and accept
equality with the blacks, Asians and others they have dominated for
so long, these observers say.
   That leaves the question of what de Klerk and the government
hope to achieve through a more moderate stance and why they have
begun to remove parts of the apartheid system.
   The government has contained, but not removed black opposition
by using the security forces and harsh restrictions. De Klerk
apparently wants to defuse the racial confrontation with political
means rather than face what he warned would be ``80 years'' of war.
   A more pressing problem is the ailing economy, buffeted by
sanctions imposed by Western nations because of apartheid and poor
management. Inflation is soaring and many white South Africans find
it harder to make ends meet.
   The government hopes to ease the economic crunch by offering
reforms to ease international sanctions and restore confidence in
the economy with new foreign investment.
   There are also signs that the government hopes a more moderate
stance and reforms would encourage some opposition groups to take a
softer line. This could lead to a compromise with some opposition
groups and isolate or weaken hard-line groups.
   But the first question de Klerk must answer is whether he has
the time and the backing of his white supporters to achieve the
compromise he says he wants.

   Exotic Kashmir, a tourist paradise of
houseboat hotels and Mogul gardens from whose name the English made
``cashmere,'' has become a war zone of separatism and religious
enmity.
   Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil
servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and
paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem
separatists in the Kashmir Valley.
   Intelligence officer M.K. Kaul commands one of the jeeps. At the
beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people, he turned
to the four soldiers in the jeep's rear seats and ordered: ``Check
your weapons. Be ready to fire.''
   Kaul settled into the front seat, a 9mm pistol in his right
hand. ``These are bad days,'' he murmured. ``These die-hard
terrorists can attack from anywhere.
   To his men, he said: ``Shoot them if you see them.''
   On Monday, an around-the-clock curfew was lifted from 5 a.m.
until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers. Soldiers in
sandbagged bunkers, armed with light machine guns, guarded main
intersections.
   A spokesman for the Jammu-Kashmir state government said the
situation was peaceful and ``absolutely normal'' in Srinagar, the
state's largest city.
   At least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began
Jan. 20 in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and
buildings. Most of the dead have been Moslem militants shot by
Indian troops.
   ``We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any
popular movement,'' said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the
only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority.
   ``We are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to
create a law and order problem,'' said Jagmohan, a Hindu with a
reputation for toughness.
   Other officials in Kashmir say privately the situation is
critical, perhaps the most serious threat India has faced in 42
years of independence from Britain.
   ``It looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist
with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become
independent,'' a state police officer said.
   Kashmir was a separate kingdom, ruled by a Hindu maharajah, when
Britain relinquished colonial rule on Aug. 15, 1947, and the
subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into India and
Pakistan.
   The Hindu king opted to join India, not Pakistan, and the
dispute over Kashmir has exacerbated relations since.
   Pakistan took the western part of Kashmir and India the eastern.
Each accused the other of forcible occupation.
   They have fought wars over Kashmir and the border question
remains unresolved. U.N. observers are stationed on the truce line
and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire.
   Officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to
the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but reports from various sources
indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have
been deployed.
   It is the valley's heavily Moslem population that tilts the
sectarian scale in Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Of the state's nearly 6 million people, 64 percent are Moslems
and 32 percent Hindus. Most Hindus live in the southern Jammu area.
   Srinagar has 150 mosques. ``This is the best breeding ground for
Moslem fundamentalism,'' said a federal official who helps
coordinate the new security measures.
   Nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to
prayer _ and, more recently, to exhort listeners to defend their
faith and Kashmir.
   ``The residents are constantly bombarded with Islamic sermons
and are reminded that fighting a `jihad' (Islamic holy war) is the
most sacred duty of every Moslem,'' the federal official said, on
condition of anonymity.
   Electricity was cut off in the city Friday, which was both the
Moslem sabbath and India's national Republic Day on India's
Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating
because militants connected them to car batteries.
   Intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage
because the separatists are not united.
   The most powerful group is the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front,
but there are several others, including the Allah Tigers,
Hezb-e-Mujahed Hezb-e-Islami.
   India claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from
Pakistan. The Pakistanis deny it.
   Jagmohan, the governor, insists the main issue in Kashmir is
economic development, not separatism.
   ``The people do not want violence or the so-called independent
Kashmir,'' he said. ``The need of the hour is development. Let more
tourists come. Let new schools be built. Let new hospitals come
up.''
   As he spoke, military officers waited in the next room to
discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist
brochures call Paradise.
   Right now, Paradise looks lost, at least temporarily.

   McDonald's imported seeds, taught Soviet potato
farmers how to increase their yields, built its own food factory,
spent $50 million and waited 14 years before selling a single
burger in Moscow.
   George Cohon, chairman of McDonald's of Canada, doesn't have any
idea if or when he'll recapture his investment after the opening of
the first franchise in the Soviet Union on Wednesday.
   ``I just know I'm going to take those rubles and build another
restaurant,'' he said.
   The restaurant, located near Pushkin Square, is the biggest
McDonald's in the world and is designed to serve 1,250 people an
hour.
   Unlike other foreign ventures, the restaurant will sell its food
for rubles, so that ordinary Soviets, not just privileged
foreigners, can eat there. A second McDonald's, out of a planned
20, will sell for hard currency to foreigners.
   Anybody who thinks it was easy to get this far need only glance
at the abandoned storefront a few miles away, its ``Pizza Hut''
sign mocking Pepsico's proud announcement that it would open a
restaurant in Moscow in 1988.
   The depth of McDonald's investment in the Soviet market can be
measured not only in currency but in the lengths it went to ensure
a reliable Soviet food supply.
   Agronomists brought in seeds and taught Soviet collective
farmers who've planted potatoes for years that they could improve
their yields 20 to 100 percent using modern methods, Cohon said.
   To avoid losing 25 percent or more of the harvest to spoilage,
McDonald's taught farmers how to pick potatoes gently and store
them properly. Purchasing manager Vladimir Boras said the company
developed its facilities near Moscow because it couldn't build a
new transportation network.
   A few weeks ago, Boras knelt in the black earth of a greenhouse
on the outskirts of the capital and examined the green budding
heads of iceberg lettuce used in a Big Mac. Above, 400-watt bulbs
blazed along the rows, making up for the short days and cloudy
skies of midwinter Moscow.
   The electric bill was $8,300 in December, said Vladimir
Goloveshkin of the Dzerzhinsky Farm, but Boras wasn't sure the
lettuce would be ready for the grand opening.
   He'd tried an experimental crop of lettuce months earlier at a
different collective farm, he said, but when he arrived to examine
it, the farmers had eaten the entire harvest.
   ``They said it was delicious,'' Boras recalled.
   Not all supplies are Soviet-made. The warehouse is brimming with
imports, including paper cups, napkins, bags, spices and secret
ingredients such as ``McDonald's Crust Improver.''
   Up to now, Gorbachev's economic reforms have had little effect
on Soviet consumers, who complain bitterly of empty store shelves
and the ridiculously high prices charged in private markets. But
the new climate opened the way for McDonald's to form a partnership
with the Moscow City Council and to contract with collective farms
now permitted to sell one-third of their fruits and vegetables on
the open market rather than to the state.
   Cohon said meat is still distributed by allocation and it took
the intervention of the mayor to obtain beef for the fast-food
restaurant.
   Even so, carcasses must be hand-selected because the local
slaughterhouse won't guarantee McDonald's the meat from the animals
it taught farmers how to raise, Boras said.
   McDonald's also benefited from other foreign investors. A
Chicago company built a model dairy to promote its milking
equipment, and McDonald's buys its milk there to avoid the high
bacteria counts common in Soviet milk.
   But the company built its own water purification system, machine
shop and laundry.
   For all that, some of the ``Soviet-sourced'' items on the firm's
list turn out to be apples from Bulgaria. With the help of Moscow
officials, McDonald's bought them for rubles after the government
imported them.
   ``It's a big country,'' said Terry Williams, a quality assurance
manager who is one of only three non-Soviets among 150 employees at
the food plant. ``There's a distinct possibility we'll find a
Soviet source next year.''

<HEAD>A Budget That's Bully on Trees and Intrigued by Magnetic
Levitation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ordinary wheel-on-rail railroads get the back
of the hand treatment in a budget proposed by President Bush that
looks forward instead to trains floating down the track through
magnetic levitation. In Bush's budget, trees make out like bandits,
too. So do robots.
   In every presidential budget proposal there are winners and
losers, but Congress often reverses their order by the time it has
worked its will, usually after August.
   This year's loser candidates are familiar targets: owners of
boats, riders of trains, buses and subways, children from affluent
homes eating subsidized school lunches. Those kids would be
required, under Bush's budget, to pay the full cost of lunch,
adding about 29 cents per meal to their outlay.
   President Reagan tried to trim their subsidies, too. Congress
balked. Now Bush has taken up the call.
   In an even more pragmatic attack on the deficit, Bush proposes
to make it harder to get away with cheating on taxes. He wants to
``close the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid.''
   Toward that end, his budget seeks more money for enforcement of
the tax laws, specifically for collecting delinquent taxes,
checking out fake dependent claims, auditing mortgage interest
deductions, and matching what the taxpayer says he received in
interest against what interest payers say they paid.
   In other time-worn economy proposals, Bush asks Congress to make
recreational and commercial boat owners pay a $25 fee; to quit
subsidizing Amtrak, a step that could jeopardize long-distance rail
travel, and to end big city mass transit subsidies that help pay
for day-to-day operations. Municipal taxpayers should shoulder that
burden, says Bush.
   ``The federal government's responsibility is not to run the
railroads,'' explained Richard Darman, the president's budget
director.
   The president's budget, however, is intrigued with more
futuristic transportation, like magnetic levitation, ``a new
transportation technology that relies on the use of magnets for
propulsion and levitation rather than conventional
steel-wheel-on-rail technology.'' Bush proposed spending $9.7
million to check it out.
   Along the same lines, the president calls for spending $192
million on robots, ``intelligent machine systems that do physical
work.''
   Most robots today work in structured environments or under close
human supervision, the budget notes, so federal research should
focus on building ``more autonomous'' robots ``capable of
interacting with a changing and uncertain environment.''
   Meantime, in a sharp break with predecessor Ronald Reagan, who
said in his 1980 campaign for the White House that trees cause
pollution, Bush embraced trees. His budget proposed planting a
billion of them a year on private land into the indefinite future.
   He called for initiating a community ``plant a tree'' initiative
that would line the streets of America with 30 million more trees.
In most cities, he said, only one tree is planted for every four
removed.
   The president said more trees would fight the threat of global
warming, combat the pollution of streams, prevent soil erosion and
save energy.
   Dense evergreens closely placed around a house can cut fuel
bills by 20 percent, the president said, and an acre of woodland is
capable of removing as much as nine tons of carbon dioxide from the
air.
   Even though 3{ million acres of trees a year are planted in the
United States, more are lost. Total woodlands decline by 700,000
acres a year, the budget says.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's budget is as cautious as the
man. It is a document that offers a little bit here, takes a little
bit there, but gives his congressional critics few safe targets for
their outrage.
   Those who demand deeper cuts from the Pentagon may feel uneasy
fighting to save the 55 domestic military bases Bush wants to close.
   It's a budget tailored to the political image the president
fosters.
   Readers of his budget can watch the environmental president
plant a billion trees and the education president bolster funds for
Head Start. Still determined to cut capital gains taxes, Bush also
offers a plan to encourage long-term savings.
   Ronald Reagan sent Congress red meat budgets. Abolish the Small
Business Administration, cut food stamps and sell the profitable
chunk of Amtrak, demanded Reagan in no-compromise budgets intended
to implement his conservative agenda.
   Reagan's goals were clear: big increases for the Pentagon, sharp
cuts for domestic programs.
   Not so the Bush budget. It is a product of a different world as
well as a different president. A Cold War pronounced dead. A Berlin
Wall crumbled. A communist threat? To themselves, maybe.
   The new budget reflects the Bush who yearns to travel a middle
road, rather than the macho president of the Panama invasion.
   His budget message was barely 10 paragraphs in length, one page
of a volume running nearly 1,600, a dry cover letter introducing
Budget Director Richard G. Darman's far more quotable essay that
talks of ``Green Eyeshades,'' the ``Cookie Monster'' and the
``Hidden Pacmen'' of federal budgets.
   It's left to Darman to deal with the sticky question of the
deficit.
   ``Unfortunately,'' wrote the budget director, ``a meaningful
answer to the question _ How big is the deficit? _ is not quite as
simple as the question.''
   As for the peace dividend people think might follow the end of
the Cold War and the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, Darman warned
there ``is a new game premised on the assumption of a substantial
near-term peace dividend. It starts by overestimating the dividend.
Then each player plans to spend the dividend in his or her
preferred way.''
   But Bush did not ignore such expectations. His budget offered a
2 percent cut in defense after inflation. The price for holding
down the Pentagon budget was closing 55 bases, many of which were
in Democratic districts.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called the proposed closings ``a
real test'' for Congress. If nothing else, the defense proposal
enabled the administration to get out front in the race to sound
willing to cut Pentagon spending.
   There are bigger targets out there, like the five B-2 stealth
bombers at a total cost of $5.5 billion, or the proposal for a $900
million increase in funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
the space-based missile defense system dubbed Star Wars.
   Predictably, Democrats grumbled when the budget reached the
Capitol.
   ``It's another fraud,'' cried Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
who has a fondness for strong rhetoric.
   But no one was shouting ``dead on arrival,'' the congressional
rallying cry of the Reagan budget years when many Republicans
joined Democrats in rejecting the president's priorities.
   More characteristic of the criticism of the Bush budget was
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's complaint. ``I think it's
a stand-pat budget,'' said the Missouri Democrat. ``I don't think
it's a budget that really meets our needs.''

   Vernon McCartney made a dive for
freedom after he was convicted of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old
girl, but a three-floor drop to the ground kept him from running,
authorities said.
   McCartney, 48, suffered a sore left chest Monday from his leap
from an open courtroom window.
   A jury had just convicted McCartney of first-degree sexual
assault, which carries a possible 15- to 25-year prison term.
   ``I've been going to court there for 40 years and never saw
anyone do that before,'' Prosecutor Ernest Morton Jr. said.
   McCartney was hospitalized in stable condition.
   Additional charges against him were unlikely, Morton said.

<HEAD>Space Program Would Get Major Boost Under Bush Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush wants to give the U.S. space
program the largest budget increase for any major government
agency, saying ``no value can be calculated'' for the benefits of
space exploration.
   In the budget he sent to Capitol Hill on Monday, the president
proposed giving the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
an authorization of $15.1 billion in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1, an increase of $2.8 billion _ nearly 24 percent _ over this
year.
   ``No price can be put on the lifting of the spirit of people
everywhere, like that which occurred at the time of the Apollo
landings on the moon,'' Bush said. ``No value can be calculated for
the wonder engendered by the pictures of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus
and, in August of 1989, of Neptune sent back over millions of miles
by Voyager.''
   In actual outlays for the 1991 fiscal year, NASA would receive a
17.5 percent increase to $14.1 billion. The space agency's spending
authority differs from the one-year budget because spending
authority includes money for projects that wouldn't be completed
and paid for until later years.
   Bush also was generous to non-space fields of scientific
research, adding $895 million for basic non-defense research for a
total of $10.9 billion, plus a $2.1 billion increase for applied
research and development, for a total $14.4 billion.
   Among the areas proposed for a boost was the National Science
Foundation, getting $2.2 billion, a 13 percent increase; AIDS
research, increasing by $749 million to $3.2 billion; and the
superconducting super collider, receiving $293 million, a 56
percent increase.
   The president's request to Congress ``demonstrates the
administration's continued strong support for NASA and the civil
space station,'' NASA administrator Richard H. Truly told a news
conference.
   The manned space station, which the United States hopes to have
in orbit late in the decade, would be the major beneficiary of an
increase _ from $1.7 billion to $2.4 billion _ as the project moves
from design to the fabrication stage. The first construction flight
is scheduled for spring 1995.
   If approved by Congress, the space budget would pay for starting
the ``Mission to Planet Earth,'' an ambitious program to study the
Earth's environment using satellites and instruments.
   The budget request includes $661 million in spending authority
to study the Earth, including money to start two polar-orbiting
platforms, the first of which would be launched in 1998. It also
would initiate the development of Earth probes, a series of smaller
instruments focused on specific, high-priority data needs,
including ozone depletion. The first would be launched in 1994.
   Last July, on the 20th anniversary of the first moon landing,
the president set a goal of having the United States return to the
moon and then begin manned exploration of Mars early in the 21st
century.
   The budget request reflects the first steps toward that goal in
a $179 million authority item for ``exploration technology,'' which
includes $4.5 million for lunar and Mars science and $11 million to
study the possibility of using nuclear propulsion for long-distance
travel in the solar system.
   Bush's proposal also envisions development of two new robotic
missions, the Lunar Observer and Lifesat. The latter would be a
series of reusable satellites designed to carry living specimens
into orbit and be returned to Earth for analysis of the effects of
long-term exposure.
   The National Aero-Space Plane, a joint NASA and Air Force
project, would receive a total $277 million in spending authority.
An additional $129 million in joint funds is proposed for
developing a new family of launch vehicles.

<HEAD>FAA's Fuel ``Shortage'' Doesn't Mean Emergency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fuel shortage like the one Avianca Flight 52
had before it crashed probably would not be taken seriously by air
controllers unless the pilot actually declared a ``fuel
emergency,'' controllers and aviation experts say.
   Under rules and standards set by the Federal Aviation
Administration, if a pilot tells air traffic controllers he has
``minimum fuel,'' both he and controllers know that no undue delay
can be accepted.
   But the FAA`s air traffic control manual says, ``This is not an
emergency situation but merely an advisory that indicates an
emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur.''
   A minimum fuel advisory does not call for the aircraft to get a
traffic priority under the FAA rules. But if the pilot declares a
fuel emergency, the entire controller system is geared to come to
his aid.
   The FAA manual puts it this way:
   ``Common sense and good judgment will determine the extent of
assistance to be given in minimum fuel situations. If at any time,
the remaining usable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic
priority to ensure a safe landing, the pilot should declare an
emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes.''
   Investigators probing the crash of the Avianca flight _ which
killed 73 people and injured 85 _ said Monday that regional
controllers relayed information from the flight to the control
center for Kennedy International Airport.
   The regional controller said Avianca 52 had just come out of the
holding area ``and can only do five more minutes of hold. Can you
take him now?''
   The local control replied, ``Slow him to 180 knots and I will
take him.''
   Records indicated the Boeing 707 had more than enough fuel to
fly from Colombia to New York, but the jet flew in holding patterns
for nearly 90 minutes because of weather-related congestion before
it crashed.
   On Sunday, Lee Dickinson of the National Transportation Safety
Board told a news conference in Melville, N.Y., there was an
apparent communications gap between high-altitude regional
controllers and those handling landings.
   As the plane neared the end of its final, 46-minute holding
pattern south of the airport, the crew told controllers in the
regional New York Center about the fuel shortage and requested
priority clearance to land, Dickinson said.
   Dickinson said that after interviewing six local controllers who
either handled or tracked the flight, investigators at first
determined they were unaware of the shortage, Dickinson said.
   R. Steve Bell, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association, AFL-CIO, called the safety board's assertions ``highly
misleading and premature.''
   The Avianca pilot never declared a fuel emergency, he noted.
``Tragically, the pilot only said that he was low on fuel, which is
a very commonplace occurrence in bad weather and holding.''
   ``This information would not necessarily have been transmitted
when one pilot hands off to another,'' he said.
   ``No one knew how perilous was his situation until it was far
too late,'' Bell said. ``The air traffic controllers would have
moved heaven and earth to make for a safe approach for the crippled
aircraft but the pilot never sent out the key words that he was in
mortal danger.''
   Fred Farrar, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Agency, said
it is not the responsibility of the controllers to relay
information other than the flight's route and number unless the
pilot specifically calls an emergency.
   ``Air traffic controllers have one primary job _ to keep
aircraft from getting too close,'' Farrar said. ``It's the
captain's job to fly the airplane. It's not the controllers' job to
make judgments for him.''

   Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin says Soviet
troops and security units are in Azerbaijan to stop ethnic
bloodshed and not to suppress political dissent.
   Dubinin's statement Monday appeared to put him at odds with
Dmitri Yazov, the Soviet defense minister. But the ambassador to
the United States insisted all Soviet officials were in agreement
on why force was used in the strife-torn republic.
   ``The situation was characterized by an orgy of killings and
pogroms, violations of elementary law and order, and armed ethnic
clashes on a large scale,'' Dubinin told reporters at the Soviet
Embassy.
   Referring to the emergency decree signed by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev two weeks ago, Dubinin said ``the only objective was to
stop the bloodshed and to restore peace.''
   His account appeared at odds with that of Yazov, who was quoted
last Friday as telling a group of Soviet journalists in Baku, the
regional capital, the military intervention was designed to prevent
a nationalist mass movement from seizing power from the Communist
Party.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday that
``certainly we found those comments disturbing, especially if they
represent accurately Soviet policy.''
   But Dubinin said Yazov had spoken only about measures taken
against ``armed activities'' of the Azerbaijan Liberation Front.
   ``I would like to point out that the political position, the
political line, the political approach of all the Soviet
leadership, of all government bodies of the Soviet Union, is
unified,'' Dubinin said.
   ``The only political line is that which was done by the decision
of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet ... and the line I have just
taken,'' the ambassador added.
   Dubinin said Gorbachev and the Presidium of the Soviet
Parliament were compelled to dispatch troops and KGB units to
Azerbaijan because ``the situation was becoming really very
dramatic'' despite vigorous efforts by the Soviet leadership over
two years to arrange a political settlement to the ethnic tensions
between Azeris and Armenians.
   Dubinin said military force was used to protect the
constitutions of the Azerbaijan and Armenian republics in the midst
of inter-national strife.
   ``The introduction of troops was necessitated not by some
political objectives related to suppressing dissent,'' he said.
``The only objective pursued by these measures was to stop the
bloodshed and restore peace and enter a sense of security to
people,'' Dubinin said.
   He said the situation in Azerbaijan remained difficult, with
trains that would carry food and fuel to Armenia under an blockade.
Schools in Armenia have been forced to shut down, factories are
idle and homes are without electricity at night.

   Here are highlights of the $1.23 trillion
spending plan proposed to Congress by President Bush, the first
drafted from scratch in his administration.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFICIT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush projects red ink of $63.1 billion dollars, a decline from
almost $124 billion in the current fiscal year, and a surplus of
$5.7 billion in the 1993 fiscal year. The Congressional Budget
Office said last week it is highly unlikely that these projections
will be borne out.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DEFENSE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For only the second time since the 1970s, an administration is
planning for a decline in defense spending after inflation. Bush
proposes $303 billion, including $10.4 billion in nuclear weapons
spending by the Energy Department, compared with $296 billion and
$8.9 billion in the current year. This is about a 2 percent
reduction in buying power.
   The budget calls for mothballing two battleships, reducing
military personnel by about 38,000 to 2,039,000, canceling 15 major
weapons programs and closing many bases.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CAPITAL GAINS and SAVINGS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bush again proposes reduced taxes on capital gains, something
Congress declined to approve last year. The maximum rate would fall
to 19.6 percent, for taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket, on assets
held at least three years.
   In an attempt to boost savings, the administration would
establish ``Family Savings Accounts'' where interest would be
tax-free if allowed to accumulate for seven years. Contributions to
these accounts could be as large as $5,000 a year for a married
couple.
   Rules would be eased for Individual Retirement Accounts to waive
the penalty on early withdrawals, up to $10,000, if the money is
used for the first purchase of a home.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUGS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The president calls for a 41 percent increase in spending for
the war against drugs, from $6.9 billion to $9.7 billion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>TRANSPORTATION:
   Spending on airports and other air transportation programs would
rise by 12 percent, from $5.74 billion to $6.47 billion. As the
Reagan administration proposed before, the budget calls for
eliminating the $600 million annual subsidy to Amtrak.
   </HEAD>
<HEAD>ENVIRONMENT:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As part of an ``America the Beautiful'' initiative, the
president proposes to spend $175 million to begin a major
reforestation program, with an eventual goal of planting trees on
1.5 million acres annually. Improvements in natural resource
protection and increased land acquisition for parks and other
purposes would bring spending under this initiative to $630 million
compared with $361 million on these items in the current year.
   The Environmental Protection Agency would get a 12 percent
increase in its operating budget, from $1.9 billion to $2.2
billion. Cleanup of nuclear weapons waste would increase from $3.7
billion to $4.5 billion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SCIENCE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A $700 million increase in spending for the planned space
station, to $2.6 billion; and a $400 million increase in
preliminary spending for manned exploration of the moon and Mars,
to about $1.3 billion, are among increases proposed for spending on
science and space that would see outlays rise from $14.1 billion to
$16.6 billion.

<HEAD>Leahy Unhappy About Farm Commodity Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's unwillingness to be
more specific about a proposed $1.5 billion cut in farm commodity
programs in fiscal 1991 doesn't sit well with Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt.
   In Bush's budget proposals sent to Congress on Monday, farm
commodity programs were projected to cost nearly $10.4 billion in
the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   But White House budget planners said outlays for the Agriculture
Department's commodity programs would be even higher if Congress
failed to go along with $1.5 billion in farm program cuts to be
worked out later with lawmakers.
   Although no one was specific about how the $1.5 billion might be
carved out of the department's Commodity Credit Corp. spending
budget for 1991, the options include further reductions in price
support and target price benefits, the ingredients to determine how
much direct crop subsidies might be due to farmers.
   Leahy, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, told a
group of bankers that the budget plan ``suggests they will continue
to cut target prices and (price support) loan rates until the farm
programs are effectively abolished.''
   In a statement later, Leahy added that as Congress begins debate
on the 1990 farm bill farmers ``deserve straight answers on the
administration's farm policy.'' He said the administration ``talks
in generalities and refuses to specify where the cuts will come
from.''
   For its part, the administration said in its budget report that
the White House ``is prepared to work closely with the Congress ...
to develop market-oriented farm legislation that allows producers
to decide what crops to grow, while also achieving the budget
savings needed in the commodity programs.''
   The document cited a number of options for reducing CCC outlays
by the $1.5 billion, including an extension ``or acceleration'' of
the downward slide in target prices and loan rates authorized in
the 1985 law.
   ``Savings also could be achieved by reducing the number of acres
eligible for payments, or targeting benefits to smaller farmers in
greatest need,'' the budget report said.
   Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, said in a statement that ``efforts to
balance the federal budget cannot be allowed to destroy one of our
greatest accomplishments, which is to provide `safety net' levels
of support'' for farmers.
   Bush also pledged Monday that the administration will work with
Congress to prevent some individual farm operations to collect
excessively large federal subsidies.
   ``Failure to do so will result in a loss of public confidence
and support for the farm program,'' said the budget report. ``The
taxpayers rightly expect these abuses to be curbed.''
   The 1985 farm law limits the amount of income-support payments
under various crop programs to $50,000 per person each year. The
limit on total federal subsidies is $250,000 per year for each
person.
   But these ceilings ``have been routinely exceeded'' because a
``person'' is defined as an individual or business entity, such as
a corporation or trust, the budget document said.
   The report included diagrams of how illegal joint ventures using
family members and other entities were set up to evade the $50,000
limit in 1988 and collect $912,089 in federal subsidies. Another
example showed payments of $801,619.
   Both examples were included last year in reports by the
Agriculture Department's inspector general.
   The budget document also said that while reducing farm program
costs is important, the administration ``also is concerned about
the distribution of those subsidy payments.''
   ``A significant portion of benefits goes to larger, wealthy
farmers,'' it said. ``In an era of limited resources, this is hard
to justify.''
   In 1987, for example, 30 percent of the $22.4 billion in
commodity related subsidies went to 4 percent of the farmers who
had average net cash incomes of more than $100,000 per year and net
worths of nearly $850,000.
   ``This should be changed,'' Congress was told. ``One option for
achieving savings of approximately one-half billion dollars would
be to eliminate direct payments to farm operators with adjusted
gross incomes of over $100,000 per year.''
   The budget document added: ``This income level, after all,
represents three times the average for an American family of four.
Up to a billion dollars could be saved by withholding direct
payments to farm entities with gross sales of $500,000 per year or
more.''

   Police Superintendent Warren Woodfork's

tested for drugs.
   ``He got a good charge out of it,'' said John Bryson, a
department spokesman.
   The computer has been programmed to randomly choose 20 Social
Security numbers a day until the entire department has been checked.
   An officer has one hour from the time he or she is notified to
get to a laboratory and provide a urine sample for testing, said
Bryson. He said Woodfork left for the lab immediately after being
told.
   Bryson said nobody knew the chief's number had been chosen until
the list of numbers was checked against personnel records.
   Under the program that went into effect Monday, an officer who
tests positive for drugs will be suspended while the result is
investigated, said Bryson.
   Officers who appear to be drunk or on drugs can be tested
immediately.
   Did the chief pass?
   Results are confidential.

<HEAD>Environmentalists Pleased That Bush Emphasizes Federal Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists are applauding President
Bush's budget emphasis on repairing damage caused by construction
of dams and other federal water projects.
   ``The president said he wanted to be known as the environmental
president,'' David Campbell, an economist with the Wildlife
Federation, said Monday. ``This actually is a fairly good start.''
   ``We've been arguing for years that both the Corps of Engineers
and the Bureau of Reclamation have overdue mitigation,'' he said.
``We should be redirecting these agency budgets from all this
harmful construction into something more environmentally
beneficial.''
   The $3.2 billion for the 1991 fiscal year for the Army Corps of
Engineers _ about the same as sought last year _ designates several
million dollars for environmental repairs and continues funding for
construction projects under way, but offers no money for new
projects.
   ``The civil works program and budget reflect the new emphasis
placed by the administration on maintaining and restoring the
environment,'' the corps said in its explanation of the budget.
   Major provisions addressing environmental concerns are:
   _$16 million for construction of juvenile fish passage
facilities on the Columbia and Snake Rivers in Washington, Oregon
and Idaho.
   _$20 million to begin acquisition of 88,000 acres to mitigate
environmental losses caused by construction of the
Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Project in Alabama and Mississippi.
   _$13 million to plan repairs to the environment damaged by
construction of Richard B. Russell Lake in South Carolina and
Georgia, and areas of Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri after
navigational improvements were made on the Missouri River.
   Campbell noted Congress gave the administration authority in
1986 to seek federal funds for the next five years to buy private
land around the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway for environmental
restoration, but the administration didn't act until this year's
budget _ the last year of the authorization.
   Campbell estimated $20 million should be enough to acquire about
47,000 acres this year.
   The fisheries on the Columbia River also are desperately needed
to restore salmon to the waterway which Campbell called ``decimated
by the dam-builders,'' who started building on the river in 1935.
   The president has asked for $1.039 billion, including $616
million in construction outlays, for the Bureau of Reclamation, an
agency within the Interior Department that assists in the
construction of irrigation reservoirs in the arid West.
   The proposal calls for a halt to federal spending on the
Garrison Diversion Unit in North Dakota, which was authorized by
Congress in 1965 to provide water to the eastern section of the
state through canals and rivers.
   The president's budget calls Garrison is ``an uneconomic and
environmentally destructive project which would require in excess
of $1 billion to complete.''
   No major new construction starts are proposed. However, dam
safety work and environmental damage mitigation at existing
projects, and most water projects already in construction would
receive continued funding.

   The real estate agent dubbed ``Robin HUD''
pleaded guilty to stealing at least $4.75 million from the federal
housing program and then said she is optimistic, even if her future
includes prison.
   ``I'm prepared to accept what comes my way. I have no fear,''
said Marilyn Louise Harrell, who entered her plea Monday in U.S.
District Court. ``A lot of my friends and former employees are
ex-offenders, and they're fine people.''
   Harrell, 46, of the southern Maryland town of Waldorf, had said
she gave much of the money she had stolen from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development to charity.
   ``I really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of
my life to help some of the people I've helped,'' she said.
   But U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox said that by April 20,
when Harrell is set to be sentenced, ``my assertion that she has
been her own biggest charity will be fact.''
   In addition to stealing government property, Harrell pleaded
guilty to lying on her tax returns and to federal officials.
   Harrell said she pleaded guilty because she did not want to
spend taxpayers' money on a trial.
   Prosecutors dropped two other tax counts, two counts of lying to
HUD officials, and one count of lying to a bank on a loan
application.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Harrell said. ``That was a very gracious
move to offer me what they offered.''
   She could be sentenced to a maximum 13 years in prison and fined
$500,000.
   Prosecutors recommended a sentence ranging from 37 months to 46
months in prison. They also plan to recommend a fine, but no amount
has been set.
   Harrell confessed to government officials in December 1988, and
became a symbol of mismanagement at HUD under the Reagan
administration when scandal erupted there last summer. After her
indictment in November, U.S. Attorney Dick Thornburgh called it the
largest theft of federal funds by an individual.
   ``I thought I'd get caught a long time ago,'' Harrell said after
Monday's U.S. District Court hearing. ``I'm sorry for what I did. I
figured I was history and would help as many as I could before I
went down.''
   Prosecutors say Harrell stole from HUD at least $6.6 million,
money generated by sales of HUD properties that Harrell handled as
a private escrow agent for the agency.
   Harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only $4.75
million and that less than 6 percent of the money benefited her
family.
   Prosecutors previously said she had taken at least $5.6 million,
but revised the figure after identifying six more properties for
which she allegedly did not remit settlement proceeds.
   Harrell said she has prepared herself for prison since 1985,
when she started diverting HUD funds. She told her family she would
use the prison time to get a college education.
   Harrell appeared relaxed at the hearing before U.S. District
Judge Herbert F. Murray.
   When Murray asked how she felt, Harrell replied, ``Terrific,
your honor.''
   Supporters who said they had benefited from Harrell's largesse
attended the hearing. One held up a giant card, decorated with
balloons, reading, ``Marilyn, We're Remembering You.''
   Charlotte Chepaitis, who said she runs a Baltimore homeless
shelter, said Harrell helped the shelter financially, but declined
to give details. ``Jesus said to do your alms in secret, and that's
just what Sister Marilyn did,'' Chepaitis said.
   ``And like Jesus said, she cried out today for forgiveness. Now
there are millions praying for her.''

<HEAD>Bush Scales Back Defense Spending But Offers Little `Peace
Dividend'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposed 1991 budget lops a
few billion dollars from defense spending in acknowledgement of the
Cold War's demise, but a ``peace dividend,'' or windfall for social
programs, is practically too small to fight over, officials say.
   The spending plan sent to Congress on Monday seeks total
military spending of $303.3 billion. That's about 2 percent, or
$3.1 billion, less than this year's Pentagon budget, after
inflation.
   The administration is shying away from talk of a ``peace
dividend'' for fear that congressional budget axes will land too
hard on the Pentagon. But the $3.1 billion figure is the likely
starting point for debate over defense savings. Some private
analysts advocate cutting defense spending in half over the coming
decade.
   Democrats already accuse the administration of protecting the
massive Pentagon budget even as political change in the Eastern
Bloc makes war increasingly unlikely.
   ``It is a Rip Van Winkle budget that has not yet awakened to the
changes in the world or the major challenges at home,'' Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., said Monday.
   In an essay accompanying Bush's spending blueprint for the year
starting Oct. 1, Budget Director Richard Darman made it clear the
administration sees no sense in clamoring for a sudden shift in
spending priorities.
   ``The issue has been framed as: `How big is the peace dividend?'
_ and, in effect, `How can I get mine?''' Darman wrote. His
suggested answers are: Not big enough to matter yet, and don't
conclude you'll get yours any time soon.
   Darman argues that in order to ensure that democracy takes hold
in the East bloc, the United States should stick to the ``peace
through strength'' formula of high defense spending that Bush
contends helped defeat the communist regimes.
   Congressional leaders already have made it clear they will try
to take a bigger chunk out of the defense budget, but the debate
over how to use any savings is less clear cut.
   Should it be used to reduce the federal deficit, or can it make
room for a tax cut? Should it go to education or housing programs?
What about repairing the bridges, tunnels and roadways across the
country that are crumbling of old age?
   Although he does not link any proposed spending increases to a
scaling back of the defense budget, Bush's 1991 budget adds $500
million of spending authority to the Head Start pre-school
education program, for a total of $1.9 billion. He also seeks more
money for urban enterprise zones designed to encourage self-help in
the inner cities, and boosts spending to combat drug abuse.
   Other proposed increases in domestic spending include an extra
$642 million for cleaning up hazardous wastes at facilities run by
several federal agencies, and $175 million to kick off a
reforestation program aimed at planting 1 billion trees.
   Some argue that far from realizing a peace dividend, the
American people are as likely to see more tax money going to pay
for the government's mistakes of the past. One example cited by
Darman is the cost of cleaning up the millions of gallons of
radioactive and toxic wastes that have been building up virtually
in secret at Energy Department nuclear weapons plants over the past
40 years.
   Darman puts that cost at $140 billion to $200 billion over the
next 30 years.
   And even as the Energy Department seeks increased financing for
the cleanup work, it remains committed to expensive projects to
modernize the nuclear arms factories. Bush's budget calls for about
a 6 percent increase, after inflation, in key weapons production
activities, plus a 19 percent jump in spending authority for
development of a new generation of reactors to make weapons
materials.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said that while spending on
weapons factories might eventually be reduced, no savings should be
expected until more U.S.-Soviet arms control agreements are
completed and East-West relations grow friendlier.
   ``Far better to press on and show the will to do what is now on
the table, then back off later,'' he told reporters. ``We recognize
that that's more expensive, but let me tell you it's the only way
for this to pay off. It's a peace through strength issue.''

<HEAD>Bush Seeks to Boost White House Spending 14 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, who wants to hold the overall
federal budget to a 3 percent increase, is seeking a $20 million,
14 percent increase to run his own office.
   The president, in the budget sent to Congress on Monday, wants
to spend $500,000 to renovate the White House kitchens and $4.5
million for a new White House computer system.
   The overall budget for the Executive Office of the President
would surge by 84 percent from $174 million to $319 million in the
1991 fiscal year, but most of that increase is for the expanded war
on drugs.
   Leaving aside the budget for the Office of National Drug Policy,
the U.S. Trade Representatives and several others listed under the
White House, the executive budget actually would climb to $158
million from $138 million, spokesman Stephen Hart said.
   Bush's salary stays frozen at $200,000, but the budget includes
an 8 percent increase for staff assistance and support (from just
less than $30 million to $32.5 million).
   Bush, who has also said he wants to be known as an environmental
president, also wants to nearly double spending on the Council on
Environmental Quality: from $1.4 million to $2.7 million, or 87
percent.
   He also provided a 19 percent increase for the National Security
Council, from $4.8 million to $5.8 million, and the National Space
Council would get an 82 percent boost to $1.2 million from $688,000.
   For the care and upkeep of the White House itself, Bush
envisions spending $7.9 million next year, an 18.3 percent jump
from the current $6.6 million spending level. The figure includes
$500,000 ``for the rehabilitation of the White House kitchens.''
Last year's budget had $800,000 to replace exterior windows of the
executive mansion.
   By law, Bush's own salary is fixed at $200,000, plus a $50,000
entertainment budget.
   Bush also requested $25 million for his new Points of Light
Initiative Foundation, a government-backed non-profit group that
will seek to spur community service and volunteerism around
America. Bush will be honorary chairman.
   The cost of maintaining the vice president's home, cars, staff
and other services would jump from $470,000 to $609,000, a 30
percent increase. That includes a $15,000 raise in his official
entertainment budget to $90,000.
   Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, chaired by Michael Boskin,
would get a 6.5 percent increase to $3 million.

   Patients in operating rooms around the
world are asking, ``What's up, Doc?''
   From Vermont to Australia, doctors and nurses are tossing aside
traditionally bland scrub uniforms and donning ones adorned with
Bugs Bunny, Tweety and baby dinosaurs.
   The designer is Dr. J. Christian Abajian, director of pediatric
anesthesiology at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont. Abajian
and his wife, Margaret, run Huggable Scrubs Inc., which customizes
the pajama-like hospital outfits.
   Abajian, 46, said he developed the idea for patterned scrubs in
1986 as a way to ease the tension felt by hospitalized children,
who often will not pay attention to hospital staff because they are
scared.
   ``We did it just to make my job easier ... just to relate to
children easier,'' said Abajian, clad in a dinosaur-dotted scrub in
one of the hospital's operating rooms.
   The first pattern, a jungle inhabited by tigers, giraffes and
frogs, was sewn by his wife, and was an immediate success, he said.
   ``There just wasn't any doubt right from day one that it was a
hit,'' he said. ``There really never was any doubt in my mind that
it would help me with a child. But I never anticipated the response
I get from adults.''
   Abajian said one time a man waiting in the delivery room told
him, ``Before I saw you wearing that shirt I was about to lose it.
I saw you and I just felt so much more relaxed.''
   Mrs. Abajian began sewing scrubs for her husband's colleagues.
   Dr. Richard Hubbell _ an ear, nose and throat surgeon clad in
scrubs showing Bugs Bunny as a circus ringmaster _ said the
clothing helps him relate to his young patients.
   ``It helps to ease their mind through a very stressful
situation,'' Hubbell said. ``The children love them.''
   When the demand started increasing as the word spread, Abajian
decided to launch Huggable Scrubs Inc.
   The Abajians then began the direct-mail company from their
northern Vermont home in Williston, with Mrs. Abajian doing the
sewing.
   After several unsuccessful ventures with investors and
manufacturers, Huggable Scrubs Inc. is finally getting off the
ground. The company now has a business manager, and is having its
garments produced by the Hedma Corp. in nearby North Troy.
   In 1988, the company had sales of about $20,000. That figure
jumped to about $74,000 in 1989.
   Huggable Scrubs needs to approach $150,000 in sales this year to
stay in business, the Abajians said.
   The company processes about 35 orders a week. Destinations
include Australia, Belize, Canada, Colombia, France, and about 300
hospitals in the United States.
   Perhaps the biggest break for the company has been their
two-year licensing agreement with Warner Bros. for the use of
Looney Tunes cartoon characters, including Bugs Bunny. The Abajians
hope Bugs, who is celebrating his 50th anniversary this year, will
help them make money.
   Michelle Greenberg, an account executive with LCA Entertainment,
a subsidiary of Warner Bros., said the company views this project
with more than just an eye on the bottom line.
   ``It doesn't really matter to us whether we make money on
this,'' Greenberg said. ``He's bringing happiness to a lot of
people. That's what his license is all about. It's good will.''

   The dollar was marginally higher against the
Japanese yen Tuesday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange inched up.
   The dollar closed at 143.25 yen, up 0.03 yen from Monday's
143.22-yen close. It started trading lower at 143.10 yen and ranged
between 143.05 yen and 143.50 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 41.97 points, or 0.11
percent, ending the day at 37,215.67.
   The index, a 299.63 point-gainer the previous day, opened higher
but gradually lost some of its early gains as Japanese government
bond prices and the yen weakened, said Toshiaki Yui, a dealer with
Nomura Securities, Co.
   Sony's announcement that it will issue 400 billion yen ($2.8
billion) worth of stock to raise its capital discouraged market
players, who worried the increase in shares might lower prices, he
said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar inched up from its opening
level as some market players sold yen to take profits on the
Japanese currency's recent gains, traders said.
   Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said
Japanese investors were not active enough to send the dollar lower.
   ``Investors overseas have been pushing the dollar lower, but
market players in Tokyo seldom take initiatives,'' she said.

   There's something fishy about the
full-page ads taken out by a wood products giant to promote a
takeover attempt involving 2.1 million acres in northern Maine.
   The newspaper advertisements show a smiling sportsman with a big
fish. There's just one little problem: There's no such fish in
northern Maine.
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. has been running the ad in Maine
newspapers for weeks to drum up support in its battle to buy Great
Northern Nekoosa Corp. for $3.8 billion.
   Biologists say the fish in the ad appears to be a striped bass,
which lives in coastal waters and not in northern Maine, the
location of the land at stake in the takeover.
   The advertisement is headlined ``The Maine Facts About
Georgia-Pacific.''
   Gail Smith, a spokeswoman at Georgia-Pacific's Atlanta
headquarters, said she had little information about the picture.
   ``It was taken somewhere in New England,'' Ms. Smith said.
``It's intended to be a representation of sporting activities.''
   The striped bass has been introduced in some freshwater bodies,
particularly in the South, and the state is trying to develop a
population in the Kennebec River.
   Fisheries biologist Paul Johnson said Monday the fish probably
will never swim in the waters of Great Northern's land.
   ``We're a long way from the coast,'' he said. ``They should just
change that ... picture in their advertisement.''

   Alaska should be put in its place _ in the
upper left-hand corner of the U.S. map, according to legislators.
   Too often Alaska is shown in a small box off the coast of
California, or just left off U.S. maps altogether, said state Rep.
Fran Ulmer.
   Ulmer is the sponsor of a resolution that asks the nation's
newspapers, magazines and book publishers to put the state in its
rightful geographic position. The Alaska House passed the
resolution unanimously Monday and sent it to the Senate.
   The resolution was expanded at the request of Rep. George Jacko
to ask publishers not to cut off the Aleutian Islands.
   ``It's usually broken off and stuck there on the bottom,'' Jacko
said. ``I want them to show how big Alaska really is.''

   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' drove ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' from the top of the list of ticket sales last
weekend.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' collected $5.7 million for a strong
per-screen average of $6,375, Exhibitor Relations Co. said Monday.
   The film stars Jessica Tandy as a Southern Jewish widow and
Morgan Freeman as her black chauffeur in a story of manners, race
relations and friendship.
   Overall weekend business at U.S. and Canadian movie theaters was
slow because of Sunday's Super Bowl, Exhibitor Relations said.

Ron Kovic, fell to second place with ticket sales of $4.6 million.
In third place was the police drama ``Tango &amp; Cash'' with $3.6
million.
   The dark divorce comedy ``The War of the Roses'' placed fourth
with $3.23 million. A close fifth was the stylish police thriller
``Internal Affairs'' at $3.18 million.
   The fright film ``Tremors'' landed in sixth by grossing $3.15
million. ``Always,'' from director Steven Spielberg, was seventh
with $2.41 million. In eighth was the ensemble drama ``Steel
Magnolias'' at $2.38 million.
   Rounding out the top ten were ``The Little Mermaid'' with
box-office revenues of $2.2 million and ``Back to the Future Part
II'' with $1.8 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations.

<HEAD>Defense Department Plan to Close Military Bases Draws Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's plan to close or scale back 72 U.S. military
installations has riled officials in large cities and small towns.
Targeted communities nationwide are mobilizing to ``fight like the
dickens'' to avoid the cuts.
   California would be the hardest hit under Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's proposal, with 10 bases employing more than 35,000
servicemen and 22,000 civilian workers slated for closure or
reductions.
   But the closings also would hit hard in communities such as
Charlestown, Ind., a southern Indiana town of 5,700 where the
Defense Department plans to mothball a munitions plant and lay off
about 900 workers.
   ``It's the only place a lot of the people have worked,'' said
Mayor Bob Braswell, who once worked as a security guard at the
Indiana Army Ammunitions Plant. ``They've worked there all their
lives.''
   In announcing his $292.1 billion fiscal 1991 spending plan
Monday, Cheney called for Congress to ``have the guts'' to make
tough decisions about closing military bases.
   The response in affected communities came quickly.
   Pennsylvania's two Republican U.S. senators, John Heinz and
Arlen Specter, showed up outside the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard,
pledging to fight the recommendation that the yard be closed.
   ``The Philadelphia Navy yard is a winner,'' said Sen. John
Heinz, ``and we are going to keep it a winner. Anybody who is going
to try to make it a loser will find out they are wrong.''
   Some lawmakers accused the Republican administration of
targeting military installations in Democratic districts.
   Rep. Glen Browder, D-Ala., sounded a battle cry to save Fort
McClellan, which officials said if closed would cost the Anniston
area in eastern Alabama 2,700 military positions and 1,500 civilian
jobs.
   ``If they are looking for a political fight, they've come to the
right place. We're ready,'' said the freshman congressman, who
defeated Republican John Rice last year in a special election to
replace the late Bill Nichols.
   California would bear the largest share of the cuts.
   One of the bases that would be closed is the Alameda Naval Air
Station, which has 8,300 servicemen and employs 5,100 civilians for
a combined annual payroll of $340 million in the island city of
77,000 in the San Francisco Bay area.
   ``This is really a terrible thing to hear, and we're not going
to lay back and let it happen,'' said Mayor Chuck Corica.
   ``We're going to fight like the dickens to keep this base open.''
   The largest possible closure in California would be Fort Ord
near Monterey and the Long Beach Naval Shipyard,
   Fort Ord is home of the Army's 7th Light Infantry Division,
which helped invade Panama last month. The base has 15,000 soldiers
and 3,000 civilian employees with a combined payroll of $732
million and an estimated impact on the local economy of more than
$885 million a year.
   The shipyard in Long Beach, one of the port city's largest
employers, could take up to $100 million a year out of the local
economy, said Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce President Bob
Creighton.
   ``Naturally, we oppose it. Naturally, we'll do whatever we can
to make sure that it doesn't become reality,'' said Assistant City
Manager John Shirey.
   Officials in some states announced plans to try to find
non-military uses for bases slated for closure.
   States that have been moving away from reliance on defense
spending said the strategy has enabled them to cope with budget
reductions.
   In Connecticut, officials said the defense industry has dropped
from 12 percent of the state's gross product in 1982 to 6 percent
in 1988, with United Technologies leading the switch. The Hartford
company has trimmed its defense operations from 75 percent 12 years
ago to just about 25 percent today.
   ``That kind of strategy will be more and more important over the
next few years,'' said Stephen B. Heintz, Connecticut's economic
development commissioner.
   Some workers took the announced closings in stride.
   Tom Ferkler, a union steward at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard,
said employees have heard several proposals during the past decade
to close the shipyard.
   ``It's the hottest topic, and naturally everyone's concerned,
but when it gets down to the workingman's level, the decision's not
in our hands.''

<HEAD>South Korea Nervous, Local Britons Worry About U.S. Base Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. plan to close or move troops from 14
military bases abroad had some South Koreans worried today, and
British communities fretted over the prospect of losing millions of
dollars in local spending.
   However, the Soviet Union said the proposed U.S. defense budget,
which calls for a 2 percent overall spending cut, is in keeping
with American and Soviet commitments that are bringing the Cold War
to an end.
   And despite local concern in communities near bases, British and
other European governments generally reacted calmly to the plan on
Monday.
   South Korean newspapers gave banner headlines in today's
editions to the U.S. plan to close three Air Force bases in that
country, where security is the No. 1 national priority.
   Reassuring nervous South Koreans, the country's defense ministry
said the combined war capability of the U.S. and South Korean
forces would be little affected by the plan.
   Brig Gen. Jimmy L. Cash, vice commander of the 7th U.S. Air
Force based in South Korea, said in a statement today: ``These
changes ... do not signal a lessening in the United States
commitment to the Republic of Korea.''
   The 11,500 U.S. Air Force personnel in the country are among
43,000 American troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact
to guard against aggression from the Communist north.
   The changes at the U.S. bases abroad would be made under a plan
proposed in Washington on Monday by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
He also wants to make similar moves at about 55 military bases in
the United States.
   The overseas bases targeted for closing are the Nea Makri Naval
Communications Station in Greece and these Air Forces bases: Comiso
Air Base, Italy; Erhac Air Base and Eskisehir Munitions Storage
Site, both in Turkey; Hellenikon Air Base, Greece; Kwang Ju Air
Base, Suwon Air Base, Taegu Air Base, all in South Korea; RAF
Fairford, RAF Greenham Common, and RAF Wethersfield, all in
Britain; and Zweibrucken Air Base in West Germany.
   The U.S. Navy would make force reductions at Bermuda Naval Air
Station and change the makeup of forces at San Miguel Naval
Communications Station in the Philippines.
   The British Defense Ministry additionally announced Monday that
a squadron of U.S. F-16 fighters based at Bentwaters in eastern
England is to be disbanded.
   Ruth Ritter, the mayor of Fairford, said: ``I am very sorry
about this decision because it is going to cause a great deal of
uncertainty in our community, particularly for the 300 (British)
civilian workers'' at the base.
   The Fairford base has 18 KC-135 air-to-air refueling tankers.
   Charles Daybell, chief executive of Braintree District Council
in eastern England, which includes the Wethersfield base, said:
``We are very sad at the thought of losing so many good friends.
The base spends nearly 6 million pounds a year in the area,''
roughly $10 million.
   The Wethersfield base houses a civil engineering unit with 531
U.S. servicemen.
   Lt. Col. Sam Giammo, director of public affairs for the 3rd U.S.
Air Force, based at Mildenhall in eastern England, said about 3,000
U.S. personnel will be withdrawn from Britain, or about 7.5 percent
of the total.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev, commenting on
the proposed U.S. defense budget, said: ``Both the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. have agreed the Cold War is over. Any vestige of that
should be relegated to history.''
   In Italy, Pio Mastrobuoni, a spokesman for Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti, said: ``The announcement is a sign of the times. The
news expresses the new reality of the climate of cooperation
between East and West.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, a firm opponent of
any significant disarmament by the West despite crumbling Communist
control in the East bloc, had ``no objections,'' said a spokeswoman
at her office.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain said during an
official visit to Washington that the U.S. plan was ``entirely
compatible with the United States commitment to NATO.''
   At Greenham Common cruise missile base west of London, where
women anti-nuclear protesters have camped outside for nearly a
decade, protester Evelyn Parker said: ``It's stunning news. This
has been an amazing thing to live through.''
   Missiles are being removed from Greenham and other bases under
the 1987 agreement between the superpowers to eliminate their
medium-range nuclear missiles.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As he went on trial with 17 other defendants, a
Shiite Moslem charged with masterminding a Paris bombing campaign
that killed 13 people told a court that his name is ``Death to the
West.''
   Police sharpshooters manned rooftops near the courthouse Monday
as officers in boats patrolled the Seine River. It was part of a
security effort under way for weeks as authorities feared the trial
might prompt fresh terrorist attacks.
   As the proceedings began Monday, the defendant said in a calm
but loud voice that drowned out the judge: ``I am not Fouad Ali
Saleh. My name is Death to the West. You have killed Moslems ....
This is war.''
   Presiding Judge Henri Malergue ordered police to escort Fouad
Ali Saleh to a cell as the reading of the charges began five
minutes into the trial.
   Saleh, a 31-year-old Tunisian, and 17 other defendants face
charges of terrorist conspiracy, possession of illegal arms,
trafficking in explosives and a variety of drug offenses. Eight are
being tried in abstentia.
   All face 10 to 20 years in prison if convicted, and a trial on
murder charges is planned later this year.
   The defendants in court Monday included Saleh's French wife,
Karima, three Tunisians, two Moroccans and three Lebanese.
   The 18 defendants are charged in a string of explosions that hit
Paris from Dec. 7, 1985, to Sept. 8, 1986. Bombers struck train
stations, department stores, and shops along the famed Champs
Elysees and throughout Paris, killing 13 people and wounding 250.
   A group calling itself the Committee for Solidarity with Arab
and Middle East Political Prisoners claimed responsibility for the
attacks and demanded freedom for three prisoners held by France.
   French officials believe members of the group were recruited and
directed by Saleh, who took his orders from Hezbollah, an
Iranian-backed group of extremist Shiite Moslems.
   Police arrested Saleh and broke up the group in March 1987.
   French media said Saleh spent a year in Libya before taking a
course in theology in Iran in 1981, when he converted from the
Sunni branch of Islam to the Shiite sect. He moved to Paris in 1983.
   Saleh set his tone for the trial when he lashed out at
prosecutor Jacques Fourvel at a court hearing three weeks ago.
   ``Shut up, you!'' Saleh shouted. ``Christians and Jews have no
right to speak when a Moslem is talking. Islam will be your death,
God will crush you. Assassin, son of a pig ... go to the devil!
Hezbollah will crush you!''
   Malergue ejected Saleh at that time and sentenced him to a
year's imprisonment for contempt.

<HEAD>Governor Taking Conservative Approach</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, a Democrat once
known as one of Virginia's most liberal legislators, has been
talking and acting like a conservative since he took office Jan. 13.
   In his first two weeks as governor, Wilder called for spending
cuts to create a budget surplus, supported expansion of the death
penalty and consulted with Republican legislators before he
presented the state budget.
   The fiscally conservative approach Wilder has taken even has
some Republicans saying he is acting more like one of them than a
Democrat.
   Some people have suggested that Wilder, the nation's first
elected black governor, is already looking beyond Virginia politics.
   ``I think he's perhaps using state politics as a vehicle for
some future run for national office,'' said Mark Rozell, a
political scientist at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg.
``He is taking a very cautious approach on many issues.''
   ``The national Democratic party needs a fiscally conservative
southerner who can hold traditional Democratic constituency
groups,'' said Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University
of Virginia.
   ``What Doug Wilder is fundamentally is a politician. He is not a
black politician. The creed of every politician is, `There go the
people. ... Let me run in front of them,''' he said.
   But Sabato said Wilder's liberal roots can be seen in some ways,
such as in the record number of blacks he has appointed to high
state offices.
   Wilder has remained mum about his ambitions. Asked whether he
would pledge to serve out his four-year term, he replied with a
smile, ``I can assure you that it is my intention.''
   Wilder has questioned past solutions to social problems, which
he said stemmed from bad attitudes. He said he would use his
example as a leader to fight drugs, illegitimacy and poor school
performance among segments of the black populace, instead of
``simply throwing money at them.''
   Wilder, a former criminal defense attorney who once opposed the
death penalty, said it should be extended to cover those who kill
during drug deals. Those slayings account for about a third of the
homicides in Richmond alone.
   ``I do think society has a right to express its outrage at
heinous crimes,'' Wilder said. ``I don't know that it would be any
deterrent.''
   Wilder's major step so far has been his plan to create a $224
million surplus in the 1990-92 state budget, which already has been
squeezed by a projected revenue shortfall that could approach $1
billion.
   The governor also proposed slashing recommended teacher pay
increases and raising liquor prices in state-run stores to create
the surplus.
   ``I was shocked by the proposal on the teacher pay raises,''
said Steve Haner, director of the Republican legislative caucus.
``That's a political group he owes his own existence to.''
   Haner said Republicans have found little to complain about in
Wilder's first weeks.
   ``Sometimes we wonder whether or not we won the election,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Budget Proposal Would Force FBI to Cut 400 Agents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI would be forced to cut 400 agents from
its workforce in its 1991 budget, largely because of a new overtime
law that is expected to add $42 million to the bureau payroll.
   The 400 agents will be eliminated as a result of attrition, said
Deputy Director Floyd Clarke, who noted that there are between 450
and 480 retirements or resignations each year. There are more than
10,000 FBI agents.
   ``Right now, our hiring program will have to be almost stopped
in 1991'' if the proposed budget stands, Clarke told reporters
Monday at a briefing on the Justice Department's budget.
   ``We just have to work harder,'' he said. ``We will get the job
done.''
   The loss of 400 agents from the FBI's payroll contrasts with
planned increases in Drug Enforcement Administration agents to
fight President Bush's stepped up war on illegal drugs. The
proposed budget would increase the number of DEA agents from 3,167
to 3,547 in the next fiscal year, DEA officials said.
   ``There is no question the drug war is receiving a very high
priority,'' said Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer. ``It is
the highest priority in the department.''
   The cut in the FBI's agent workforce would be only the second in
a decade; the 1981 fiscal year budget cut 93 agents.
   The proposed $1.54 billion FBI budget would increase
expenditures by $100 million from the current budget of $1.4
billion.
   Proposed increases for more agents for such high-priority
activities as white-collar and organized-crime investigations
partially offset the across-the-board manpower cuts.
   But even the white-collar crime section will suffer a net loss
of 41 agents under the proposed budget. There would also be a net
loss of six agents assigned to organized-crime cases.
   Those decreases would be implemented despite Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh's repeated vow to fight ``crime in the suites.''
   ``Those priorities remain the attorney general's priorities,''
said Justice Department spokesman David Runkel. But the FBI's ``job
is to manage the operation within the budget provided them.''
   In the coming months, the Justice Department will work with the
FBI ``to ensure that in the implementation of a final budget there
will be no diminution of effort in the priority areas identified by
the president and the attorney general,'' Runkel said.
   Runkel suggested the bureau could better manage the time of
agents to reduce the overtime budget. Virtually every FBI agent
earns overtime, officials said.
   The FBI will eliminate 227 agents at a savings of $25.7 million
to meet deficit-reduction targets, officials said.
   The bureau also plans to cut 559 agents to finance the higher
cost of overtime under a new law enacted by Congress. The overtime
formula for paying federal law enforcement agents is expected to
cost the FBI $41.9 million in the 1991 fiscal year, according to
Justice Department budget documents.
   The increases for high-priority programs will add 388 agents,
resulting in a net loss of 400 agents, according to budget
documents.
   The new law pegs overtime pay to an agent's actual pay grade.
Previously, all agents over Grade 10 earned overtime calculated to
that pay level.
   Senior agents will earn between $13,000 and $15,000 in overtime
each year instead of $6,000 to $7,000, Runkel said.
   The Justice Department expects to spend $66 million in
additional overtime for FBI, Immigration and Naturalization Service
and DEA agents in the 1991 fiscal year.
   The Office of Management and Budget had originally agreed to add
that money to the department's budget, said one department source.
However, OMB later decided to force the Justice Department to
absorb the extra overtime expenses, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Employer Medical Insurance Costs Jump in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medical insurance costs for employers rose
20.4 percent last year, according to new survey.
   The survey of 1,943 employers, released Monday, found the
average cost of medical plans rose to $2,600 per employee, up from
$2,160 in 1988. The average cost for employees enrolled in health
maintenance organizations jumped 16.5 percent to $2,319 from $1,991
the previous year.
   The figures include both employee and employer contributions,
but do not include dental plans.
   The survey, conducted by the consulting firm of A. Foster
Higgins &amp; Co. Inc., said employers commonly cited several reasons
for the rise:
   _Increasing use of new and expensive medical technologies and
drug therapies.
   _Larger and more frequent claims for catastrophic illnesses.
   _Escalating costs for outpatient services, mental health and
substance abuse services.

   Telephone companies would have to give
customers the option of blocking Caller I.D., a new service that
displays a caller's phone number before the receiver is picked up,
under Senate legislation.
   Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., said he was in favor of the new
technology, but that customers also should not have to give out
their phone numbers.
   ``A privacy balance must be struck,'' Kohl said Monday in
introducing the Telephone Privacy Act of 1990. ``Who decides
whether the caller will reveal his or her number?'' Kohl said. ``I
think the decision must rest with the caller.''
   Caller I.D., which has been available in New Jersey for more
than a year and is just beginning to be offered in Tennessee, West
Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Maryland, uses a small
terminal that displays the numbers of incoming calls. The device
costs $50 or more to purchase, and the Caller I.D. service costs

<HEAD>World Earthquakes, Deaths Down in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of significant earthquakes was down
last year despite the World Series quake in California, and total
deaths were well below average, the U.S. Geological Survey reports.
   Earthquake fatalities worldwide totaled 526 last year, well
below the long-term average of 10,000 deaths per year.
   The Oct. 17 California quake, which has been named the Loma
Prieta quake, killed 62 people, injured an estimated 3,500 and
caused damage totaling at least $5.6 billion.
   In 1988, tremors claimed some 28,000 lives, most in the
earthquake that struck Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7 of that year.
   Overall there were 55 significant earthquakes last year, six
fewer than in 1988. On average the world had about 60 significant
quake a year.
   A significant quake is defined as one that registers at least
6.5 on the Richter scale, or one that has a lower reading but which
causes casualties or significant damage.
   Last year's deadliest quake occurred Jan. 22, killing 274 people
in the Tajik region of the Soviet Union. Ninety died in Iran in a
quake that struck on Aug. 1.
   The strongest tremor of the year occurred May 23 in the South
Pacific. It was a so-called Great quake, measuring 8.3 on the
Richter scale.

<HEAD>Government Rescinds State of Siege; Exiles Call Move An Empty
Gesture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The military government lifted a
state of siege and ended press restrictions after a 10-day
crackdown on the democratic opposition, but newly exiled activists
called the gesture meaningless.
   State television, announcing the end of the measures on Monday
night, said they had ``produced their full effect and permitted the
settlement of the crisis which threatened the future of Haitian
democracy.''
   Three government critics banished during the crackdown said the
true threat to establishing democracy on this impoverished
Caribbean island is the military leadership. They said the free
elections Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril has promised for October remain an
impossiblity under the circumstances.
   The state of siege was declared Jan. 20 to put an end to
``subversive machinations,'' President Avril told the nation on
Saturday. The government had also suspended articles of the
constitution that prohibited the forced exile of political
opponents.
   On Jan. 22, the government banned television and radio news
broadcasting that it had not authorized. Those restrictions were
lifted on Monday.
   Avril said Saturday that the state of siege would be lifted
today, ``in view of the positive results already obtained.''
   More than 50 opposition politicians and militants were have been
arrested in the crackdown. Most said they were beaten before being
released. At least four were reported missing or still in custody.
   Human rights activist Robert Duval and political leaders Sylvio
Claude and Gerard Phillipe-Auguste went into hiding.
   Dr. Louis Roy, called the ``father of the constitution'' in
Haiti; conservative politician Hubert de Ronceray; Communist Party
second-in-command Max Bourjolly, prominent businessman and civic
leader Antoine Izmery, and three other opposition militants were
sent into exile.
   In Miami on Monday night, Robert Leger, a spokesman for Roy, de
Ronceray and Izmery, said, ``The suspension of the decree means
nothing to us. A free, fair and honest electoral process under
Avril is impossible.''
   Another emergency measure imposing an entry visa for Haitian
citizens was also rescinded Monday.
   The government declared the state of siege a day after gunmen
killed an army colonel, his wife and their maid. Avril said the
crackdown was necessary ``to protect democratic accomplishments
against terrorism,'' implying that enemies of the government
carried out the assassination.
   Skeptics saw it, however, as a pretext for Avril to consolidate
his power and renege on his promise to hold legitimate elections.
   The emergency measures had provoked world protest.
   The United States, Canadian, and French governments and the
European Community condemned the measures. France suspended foreign
aid negotiations and the Bush administration indicated there would
be no early resumption of Washington's $60 million annual aid
package.
   In addition, the Association of Haitian Industrialists and the
Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry had demanded the emergency
measures be revoked.
   On Sunday, the 10 bishops of Haiti's Roman Catholic Episcopal
Conference demanded that the government respect the ``letter and
the spirit of the entire constitution,'' that it ``abolish torture
in all its forms'' and that it create ``a favorable climate for
free and honest elections'' this year.
   In his speech to the nation, Avril reaffirmed his government's
commitment to elections, but ``in a more serene climate.''
   Avril rose to power in a September 1988 coup led by
noncommissioned officers who professed disgust with the state
terrorism under the military man they ousted, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   He had led the military junta that assumed power when
President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in
February 1986 during a popular uprising, ending the harsh 27-year
Duvalier dynasty.
   Presidential elections were held on Nov. 29, 1987 but aborted
after thugs, protected by soldiers, massacred at least 34 voters at
polling stations.
   Civilian Leslie Manigat won army-run elections in January 1988
and was overthrown by Namphy in June 1988.

<HEAD>Computerized Therapy Helps Depression Patients, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer did as well as a human therapist in
treating depression in a new study, and researchers say the
machines may someday help psychotherapists treat the common
disorder.
   Computerized treatment might be provided day and night at a cost
of perhaps 50 cents an hour, and the machine ``doesn't have any bad
days,'' said researcher John Greist.
   Human therapists now can treat only a fraction of the 10 million
Americans who suffer depression within any six-month period, he
said.
   But roughly a third of people with depression may one day be
helped by computerized therapy if further research shows it is
useful, said Greist, a psychiatry professor at the University of
Wisconsin Medical School in Madison.
   Humans would still be needed to screen patients for the therapy
and to step in if the computer fails to treat the patient
adequately, he said in a recent interview. And the therapeutic
approach used in the study works best for people with only mild to
moderate depression, he said.
   The study is presented in this month's issue of the American
Journal of Psychiatry by Greist, Paulette Selmi, and others at the
university.
   T. Byram Karasu, professor of psychiatry at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine in New York, called the study important.
   But he cautioned that cognitive-behavioral therapy, the approach
used by the computer and the human therapist in the study, is
generally less effective for depression than other strategies,
including medication.
   He also stressed that while computers might be useful for some
aspects of psychotherapy, they cannot totally replace a human
therapist. Most depressed patients are ``starving for human
contact,'' he said.
   The study compared the progress of 12 depressed people who
received therapy from a computer, 12 who consulted a therapist, and
12 who received no treatment during the experiment.
   The two treated groups followed a six-week course of weekly
cognitive-behavioral therapy. This approach aims to correct harmful
patterns in how people interpret their experiences, such as in
people who habitually perceive slights and conclude that they must
be worthless and not liked.
   The therapist's job in this approach is fairly routine and can
become repetitious, Greist said. That makes the regimen ``a poor
use of human beings'' but a good candidate for being done by
computer, he said.
   Using a program Selmi designed, the computer in the study asked
such questions as how long a person had felt depressed and which
activities in a list made the person feel better. It also asked
about particular symptoms and asked the person to rank the severity
of his depression on a standard scale.
   In this way, the computer could get ``a pretty crisp idea of the
nature of this person's depression,'' Greist said.
   The computer used responses to its multiple-choice questions to
shape the course of each session and future sessions.
   The actual therapy included teaching basics of
cognitive-behavioral therapy, testing the person's understanding of
the lessons, and assigning homework. Depending on the person's
problems, the homework could include such tasks as reading
particular chapters of books, thinking about less damaging
explanations for perceived slights, or introducing oneself to new
people daily to discover that one is not always rejected.
   Analysis showed that as a group, patients who took computerized
therapy improved as much as those in the other treated group, both
at the conclusion of treatment and two months later. Both groups
improved significantly more than the people who had received no
therapy.

   A parade of show business stars serenaded
President Bush and 800 of the Republican party's biggest donors at
a Kennedy Center gala that also featured the spectacle of GOP
Chairman Lee Atwater trading guitar licks with blues legend B.B.
King.
   Bush advised his party chieftain afterwards, ``Lee, I heard your
music. Don't give up your daytime work.''
   The show, which also drew much of the Cabinet and GOP leaders of
Congress, also evoked a stream of ringing endorsements for Bush and
Vice President Dan Quayle, who came in mid-concert fresh from his
return from a fence-mending mission to Latin America.
   Chubby Checker, before twisting the night away with 15 teens
from the Duke Ellington School for the Performing Arts, praised the
president and added of Quayle: ``He's such a good-looking guy.
Don't sell this guy short.''
   The crowd responded with loud applause. Bush later said
approvingly, ``It was from the heart and well-deserved.''
   Tony Bennett sang his signature song, ``I Left My Heart in San
Francisco'' and then, without benefit of a microphone, ``Fly me to
the Moon.''
   Roberta Flack dedicated her trademark song, ``The First Time
Ever I Saw Your Face,'' to the Quayles, and then followed with
``Always'' for the Bushes.
   Frankie Valli, backed up by the Four Seasons and two more
musicians, serenaded the first couple with, ``You're Just Too Good
to be True,'' and said in his brief political pitch, ``We believe
you're doing an incredible job and we certainly are looking forward
to seven more years of the Bush administration.''
   Other entertainers included Harry Connick Jr., a young jazz
pianist from New Orleans, and country singer Randy Travis.
   After watching a slide show that noted Bush had met with 120
foreign leaders and logged 130,000 miles on trips in his first year
that took him to 33 states and 15 foreign countries, emcee Mary
Hart of television's ``Entertainment Tonight'' quipped, ``Seeing
what you have done in one year, I'm exhausted.''
   Russian-born comedian Yakov Smirnoff said, ``The chairman of the
Republican Party playing a guitar. What a country, I'll tell you!
Try to picture Gorbachev doing that.''
   Smirnoff took questions from the audience and someone asked what
he thought of the Soviet leader.
   ``I think he's doing a good job,'' he said, but he quickly
added, ``Let me ask you this: how many people here trust Gorbachev?
Applaud if you do.''
   There was a ripple of applause through the hall.
   ``O.K. How many people here don't trust him?''
   Most of the crowd began clapping.
   ``That's what I think,'' said the emigre comedian.
   Atwater said the evening brought together three of his idols:
his wife Sally, pregnant with their third child; his ``political
idol,'' Bush, and blues great King. Atwater, clad in tuxedo,
gyrated, shimmied, rolled his tongue and puckered his lips up into
a fish face as he played in tandem with King and his famous guitar,
``Lucille.''
   It was a sedate audience that resisted most of the stars'
efforts to instigate rhythmic clapping or singing.
   The evening was billed as ``the Presidential Inaugural
Anniversary Gala'' by its sponsor, the Republican National
Committee. The price of a ticket was $1,000 on top of the
$10,000-a-year dues that the donors pay for the privilege of being
designated a Republican Eagle _ a club created 15 years ago as one
of the GOP's most successful fund-raising devices.
   Bush, speaking from the stage at the end of the concert, saluted
the party's benefactors, saying, ``The Eagle is the symbol of
America. ... You've always been our strong right arm.''
   ``Last year we got started. We got the ball rolling on ways that
we can make America cleaner and leaner and more competitive,'' said
Bush. ``And now I will again ask the Democrats up on Capitol Hill
to work with us in a bipartisan manner to fight the scourge of
drugs and crime, to clean our air and to educate yet another
generation of American children.''

   Federal officials defended regional air
traffic controllers who never explicitly told local controllers
that Avianca Flight 52 was short on fuel before it crashed, killing
73 of 159 people aboard.
   The Colombian jetliner's cockpit crew told regional,
high-altitude controllers about the fuel shortage 45 minutes before
Thursday night's crash, but did not make clear the severity of the
situation, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Fred Farrar
said Monday.
   The pilot requested only ``priority'' clearance to land, and
that word ``has no particular meaning in air traffic control,''
Farrar said. ``If there is an emergency, you use the word
`emergency.'''
   The FAA, whose duties include overseeing the nation's air
traffic controllers, released a partial transcript of taped
conversations among the crew and controllers as the National
Transportation Safety Board today neared the end of its on-site
investigation.
   The transcripts showed that in a telephone conversation, the
regional controllers told counterparts responsible for landings at
Kennedy International Airport that the Colombian jetliner couldn't
remain in a holding pattern south of the airport for more than five
minutes.
   But the regional controllers did not explicitly mention the fuel
shortage, the transcripts show.
   The flight was cleared for landing at Kennedy 37 minutes later,
but that attempt was aborted, apparently because of bad weather.
Less than 10 minutes later, the Boeing 707 fell powerless into a
wooded hillshide in the secluded Long Island village of Cove Neck.
   The cockpit crew were among those killed. More than 20 survivors
remained hospitalized in critical condition.
   FAA rules for flight emergencies spell out instructions for
pilots, including those with foreign airlines, landing at U.S.
airports.
   ``If, at any time, the remaining usable fuel supply suggests the
need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing, the pilot
should declare an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes,''
the instructions say.
   Investigators are considering the possibility that the Colombian
pilot interchanged the words ``priority'' and ``emergency'' by
mistake. They also planned to talk with Avianca officials about
what instructions are given to pilots when they have fuel problems.
   The FAA and NTSB, as well as the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, stressed Monday that the plane's message
was not urgent and did not use the word ``emergency,'' which would
have brought the plane to a quick landing at Kennedy.
   The words ``emergency'' or ``minimum fuel'' ``would have
triggered an emergency response by controllers,'' said controllers
association president R. Steve Bell. ``Stating that you are low on
fuel does not imply an immediate problem.''
   Another union official who listened to the tapes said that the
pilot never sounded worried.
   ``He said, `I'm running out of fuel,' just as calm as if he were
sitting in his living room,'' said Barry Krasner, eastern regional
representative of the controllers association.
   About 8:45 p.m., as they were circling over New Jersey, the
cockpit crew warned the regional control center that they were low
on fuel.
   ``We think we may need priority,'' a crew member told the
control centerl
   A regional controller replied, ``How long can you hold before
you have to go to your alternate (landing site)?''
   ``Wait a minute,'' the cockpit replied, pausing apparently to
check. ``We can hold five minutes.'' Shortly thereafter, the
cockpit said the alternate landing site was Boston, and ``I can't
make it.''
   At that time, the FAA said, the regional controller phoned the
local controllers, and said, ``Avianca 52 just came out of Cameron
(the name of the holding area) and can only do five more minutes of
hold. Can you take him now?''
   The local controller replied, ``Slow him to 180 knots and I will
take him.''
   After the phone call, the plane was released to Kennedy. It made
a missed approach 37 minutes later through rain and fog, coming in
too steeply, authorities said.
   Investigators said the crew agreed to a controller's suggestion
that the plane loop back over Long Island and come in for a second
attempt. It did so, the cockpit saying twice more it was low on
fuel, but the engines soon quit and the plane crashed.
   Fuel gauges _ which some pilots say are unreliable in 707s _ and
cockpit documents have been taken to a Washington lab, NTSB member
Lee Dickinson said.

   A briefcase booby-trapped with a sawed-off rifle
probably was sent as a warning to a federal prosecutor who has
investigated major heroin traffickers, authorities said.
   ``It could have killed the person opening it,'' U.S. Attorney
Andrew J. Maloney said Monday. ``I think it's because of the kind
of work this assistant may have been working on.''
   The briefcase had not been considered suspicious when it was
delivered by mail Monday to the office of Assistant U.S. Attorney
Catherine Palmer. It was delivered to the federal courthouse in
Brooklyn despite increased security in the wake of the package
bombs that killed an federal judge and civil rights lawyer in
Alabama and Georgia.
   The device was disarmed by federal agents working with Ms.
Palmer on another case.
   ``They happened to be there and opened the package. ... I think
it was more luck than anything that it didn't go off,'' Maloney
said.
   A police spokeswoman, Officer Janice Swinney, described the gun
as a .22-caliber rifle ``set to go off,'' but did not elaborate.
   Maloney said he believed the device, which contained no note or
other threat, was related to Ms. Palmer's work as a drug
prosecutor, not to civil rights.
   The veteran prosecutor specializes in large Asian heroin
trafficking networks.
   The investigation was turned over to the FBI, which refused to
comment.

   Ava Gardner, whose sensuous beauty took
her to Hollywood and stardom, was buried in native soil in a quiet
ceremony attended by family and hometown friends.
   About 500 people stood in drizzling rain Monday at Sunset
Memorial Park in this farming community to pay their last respects.
Miss Gardner, 67, died of pneumonia Thursday in London, where she
had lived the past two decades.
   Miss Gardner was buried a few miles from Brogden, where she was
born on Christmas Eve, 1922, and lived until she was 13. Smithfield
was the town ``she knew and loved as home,'' said the Rev. Francis
Bradshaw, pastor of Centenary United Methodist Church in
Smithfield, at the graveside service.
   ``We come to celebrate this life who brought so much to so many
publicly but who brought so much to so many privately as well,''
Bradshaw said. ``She touched lives the world over.''
   Miss Gardner wound up with a screen test and a $50-a-week
contract with MGM after photographs taken by her brother-in-law
caught the eye of a studio clerk.
   Between 1942 and 1980, Miss Gardner made more than 60 feature
films, including ``Show Boat,'' ``Mogambo,'' ``The Barefoot
Contessa,'' and ``On The Beach,'' with such leading men as Clark
Gable, Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart. In 1985, she appeared in
the CBS television series ``Knots Landing.''
   Friends and relatives, including Miss Gardner's sister, Myra
Pearce, attended the service. Another sister, Beatrice Cole, had
recently been hospitalized and was unable to attend, friends said.
   Miss Gardner, youngest of seven children, was buried next to her
brother Jack, a state legislator who died in 1981. Two other
sisters, Inez and Elsie, and a brother, Raymond, also are dead.
   Miss Gardner had been married to Mickey Rooney, jazz bandleader
Artie Shaw and to Frank Sinatra.
   Family and friends said Miss Gardner often visited, although her
family moved to Newport News, Va., when she was 13.
   ``She was a nice lady _ real reserved,'' said Alan Gardner, who
last saw his first cousin at a family reunion 12 years ago. ``She
dressed in old clothes and wore no makeup when she was here so she
looked quite different.''
   Most of those on hand were fans or local residents who recalled
their connections to Miss Gardner.
   Janice Massengill said her father worked at The White Swan, a
barbecue restaurant where Miss Gardner ate when she returned to the
area.
   ``It makes it a great honor for her to come to your hometown for
her resting place. Ever since I was little, I've always heard of
Ava Gardner,'' Massengill said.

<HEAD>Congresswoman: America Needs `User-Friendly' Birth Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation needs ``user-friendly'' birth control
methods to reduce its 3.4 million unplanned pregnancies each year
and end the ``war'' over abortion, says a lawmaker backing more
funding for contraceptive research.
   ``In the '80s, Iran and the United States were the only two
countries that really went backward in family planning,'' Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Col., said Monday at a Planned Parenthood
conference.
   ``We should be discussing where we want to be five years from
now _ whether we still want to be at war on these issues, or
whether we want to be at peace.''
   Schroeder said she and Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, ``decided we
wanted to be at peace,'' and co-sponsored a measure last July to
make the federal government the leader in finding new methods of
birth control and techniques against infertility, which affects an
estimated one of six U.S. women.
   Their proposal calls for spending $77.2 million over five years
to establish five new research centers exploring the two issues.
   ``Any woman who reads women's magazines knows what the damage of
the '80s has been,'' Schroeder said. ``You pick up any magazine and
many newspapers, and there's constantly some kind of article
questioning the safety of current contraceptives. ...
   ``Now why isn't the federal government answering those
questions?'' she asked.
   Federal funds for such research through the National Institutes
of Health and the Agency for International Development totaled
$30.8 million in 1988, down from $32.4 million in 1987.
   ``The amount of dollars spent a year for this research would
keep the Defense Department running for 15 minutes,'' said Dr.
Louise B. Tyrer, vice president of medical affairs for the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America Inc.
   Schroeder said safety questions over available contraceptive
methods have reduced options for U.S. women.
   ``They've been left to what Cleopatra had _ sponges,'' she said.
   ``The question is how do we make contraceptives user-friendly to
women, and to men ... and that they feel are safe?''
   Lawsuits over intrauterine devices, or IUDs, have undermined the
ability of most U.S. pharmaceutical companies to market them.
   And Congress in the 1970s declined to fund federal research into
birth control methods that would act after conception, such as
RU-486, the so-called ``abortion pill'' developed by the French.
   Minutes after Schroeder began speaking, Joe Scheidler, director
of the Chicago-based Pro-Life Action League, tried to enter the
room but was turned back.
   ``They're trying to get the government to fund research on
abortifacients and contraceptives,'' he said. Abortifacients are
birth control methods that prevent pregnancy after conception.
   ``We're very much opposed to the use of government money to
destroy our children.''

<HEAD>Sammy Davis Jr. Hospitalized for Gum Infection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Song and dance man Sammy Davis Jr., who
recently completed treatment for throat cancer, has been admitted
to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for a gum infection, a spokesman
said today.
   The 64-year-old entertainer contracted the infection after some
dental work in which several teeth were removed, said hospital
spokesman Ron Wise.
   ``He had dental work about a month ago and got an infection in a
couple of his teeth, which were removed,'' Wise said. ``He's being
treated for a second small infection but he's doing well.''
   Wise, who was contacted at home, could not say when Davis was
admitted.
   ``Sammy's ambulatory. He's walking around,'' Wise said. ``The
infection is controlled and he should be out in a few days.''
   During an annual medical examination last September, Davis'
physician Dr. Gerald Blankfort detected something out of the
ordinary, which was diagnosed as a throat carcinoma.
   Davis, who had been touring with Frank Sinatra and Liza
Minnelli, was forced to cancel concerts to undergo radiation
treatment. Miss Minnelli and Sinatra continued with the tour.
   ``With the help of the good Lord,'' Davis said then, ``I'll be
back cooking by the end of the year.''
   He was honored in November at an all-star salute to his 60 years
in show business. The gala, which included such stars as Eddie
Murphy, Ella Fitzgerald, Michael Jackson and tap dancer Gregory
Hines, recently was broadcast by ABC-TV.
   Davis has said his cancer treatment was completed with doctors
highly optimistic there would be no recurrence.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Surrender Dynamite, Say They've Abducted Diplomat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers surrendered 2,200
pounds of dynamite, saying they wanted to show they are sincere in
seeking peace with the government, and claimed to be preparing to
free a kidnapped Colombian diplomat.
   The cocaine barons said Roberto Garcia-Pena, the country's
former consul in Miami, would be freed with a peace message for
President Virgilio Barco, who declared war on the traffickers five
months ago.
   Colombia has since been terrorized by attacks blamed on drug
gangs that have claimed at least 209 lives.
   The dynamite, packed in a bus, was found in Medellin, the
northwestern city that is a hub of the drug trade. The traffickers
telephoned reporters to offer the reasons they were giving up the
explosives.
   Their statement on the kidnapping, delivered to the RCN radio
network, said Garcia-Pena was abducted Friday in Bogota and would
be freed today with the message for Barco.
   The statement was signed by the Extraditables, the name adopted
by the cocaine barons, who are trying to force the government to
abandon extradition of Colombians wanted on drug trafficking
charges in the United States.
   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said privately that
Garcia-Pena, Colombia's consul in Miami for 18 years until 1988,
disappeared Friday but the ministry had not heard from kidnappers.
   Garcia-Pena, 54, is the son of the editor emeritus of Colombia's
largest newspaper, El Tiempo of Bogota.
   Since Barco declared war on the cocaine gangs Aug. 18 after the
assassination of a leading presidential candidate, drug bosses have
been blamed for 262 bombings and other terrorist attacks.
   All 107 passengers aboard a Colombian airliner died in a
November crash blamed on the traffickers.
   Medellin police said in a news release the dynamite found in the
bus was not connected to detonators.
   Also in the bus was a statement saying the traffickers would
continue giving up explosives. It, too, was signed by the
Extraditables.
   The statement accused the national anti-narcotics police of
torture and murder and claimed, without giving details, the police
had murdered 10 men arrested on suspicion of being hired killers.
   A man saying he spoke for the Extraditables called the RCN
station in Medellin on Monday and said the traffickers ``do not
have any missiles and don't want to attack the United States.''
   He appeared to be responding to reports in the United States
that the U.S. Secret Service had learned the traffickers had
shoulder-fired missiles and might try to attack President Bush when
he visits Colombia next month.
   Bush is to meet with some Latin American presidents Feb. 15 in
Cartagena, on Colombia's north coast, for a discussion of what to
do about drug trafficking.
   On Jan. 17, the Extraditables issued a statement saying Barco
had won the drug war and offered to abandon the drug trade, give up
their weapons and release all hostages if granted amnesty.
   In return, they said they wanted constitutional guarantees. They
did explain but presumably meant assurances they would not be
extradited to the United States. Since the drug crackdown began in
August, Colombia has extradited 13 suspects for trial.
   Colombian analysts have said they doubt the traffickers
considered themselves beaten and believed the offer to abandon the
drug trade was a ploy to get the government to negotiate.
   However, since their statement of capitulation, the
Extraditables have released six of 22 people kidnapped over the
last two months.
   Police said Monday they had found a weapons cache on a ranch
owned by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a leading trafficker killed in a
gun battle with officers last month.
   A news release said they found 170 rifles and 55 pounds of
dynamite on the Veracruz ranch 95 miles north of Bogota.

<HEAD>NASA Plans Nine Space Shuttle Launches in 1990</HEAD>

   A new NASA schedule reduces from 10
to nine the number of space shuttle launches planned for this year,
with the number rising to 12 in 1992 and 13 in 1993.
   ``It's a good plan and we think we can do it,'' launch director
Bob Sieck told reporters after a schedule was released Monday
listing 74 shuttle flights between now and the end of 1996.
   He noted the launch team has dispatched eight shuttles since
flights resumed in September 1988, after a 32-month hiatus
following the 1986 Challenger explosion.
   ``We have a well-trained and competent team,'' Sieck said. ``We
are seeing more stability in the hardware and the requirements.
We're bringing new equipment on line and the performance of the
logistics system looks good.''
   He said an orbiter being built to replace Challenger will arrive
here next year and be ready for its first flight in early 1992, in
time to support the accelerated launch schedule.
   Nine flights this year would match the record set in 1985.
   The elimination of one flight in 1990 was necessitated by a
delay from March 26 to April 18 in the launch of Discovery with the
Hubble Space Telescope. That postponement was announced earlier
this month after engineers detected a problem with one of the
shuttle's two solid fuel boost rockets.
   That also resulted in the delay of another science payload, that
of the Gamma Ray Telescope, from June until November and the
rearranging of other flights.
   The dropped 1990 flight, that of a Strategic Defense Initiative
payload, was put off nearly 14 months until January 1992. The
explanation given was that this caused the least disturbance to the
overall schedule.
   The space agency's new long-range plans call for eight flights
in 1991, 12 in 1992, 13 in 1993, 11 in 1994, 11 in 1995 and 10 in
1996.
   This year's schedule originally listed nine flights, but was
increased to 10 when a planned December launch of Columbia was
delayed into January. That flight, launched Jan. 9, deployed a
communications satellite and retrieved a science laboratory that
had orbited for six years.
   The new manifest for the remainder of 1990:
   _Feb. 22, Atlantis, with a Defense Department payload that
reportedly is an advanced reconnaissance satellite.
   _April 18, Discovery, with the Hubble Space Telescope.
   _May 9, Columbia, with an astronomy laboratory.
   _July 8, Atlantis, with a Defense Department payload.
   _Aug. 29, Columbia, with a Space Life Sciences Laboratory.
   _Oct. 5, Discovery, with the Ulysses spacecraft to study the sun.
   _Nov. 1, Atlantis, with the Gamma Ray Observatory to study deep
space.
   _Dec. 12 Columbia, with the International Microgravity
Laboratory.

<HEAD>Informer: Gotti Wanted Someone `Whacked'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former gang enforcer who turned informer
testified that he was introduced to John Gotti as a man who would
``whack'' somebody for the reputed mob boss.
   James ``Studs'' McElroy testified in Gotti's assault and
conspiracy trial Monday that he was told after another reputed
mobster's wake that Gotti wanted somebody ``whacked.''
   The pair met, McElroy said, in April 1986 at the wake of Frank
DeCicco, reputedly Gotti's underboss in the Gambino crime family.
   In an unusually hostile cross-examination, Gotti's lawyer, Bruce
Cutler, disputed McElroy's testimony, calling him a liar, a rat,
and a ``yellow dog.''
   Cutler tried to portray McElroy, 45, as a coward who shot or
knifed many people, but only if they couldn't fight back.
   McElroy said he accompanied James Coonan, leader of the West
Side gang known as the Westies, to DeCicco's wake at a Brooklyn
funeral parlor. He quoted Gotti as asking Coonan, ``Is this the
kid?''
   According to McElroy, Gotti then turned to him and said, ``I've
heard a lot about you. I'd like to take you to dinner someday.''
   At another point, McElroy said Coonan asked him in Gotti's
presence, ``Jimmy, can you do it?'' McElroy said he answered that
he could, even though he did not know what Coonan was asking about.
   ``You agreed to do it and you didn't know what it was they
wanted done?'' asked Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky.
   ``Yeah,'' he replied.
   Later, at a restaurant, Coonan told him that Gotti's crime
family ``wanted somebody whacked,'' McElroy testified.
   The target was John F. O'Connor, vice president of Carpenters
Union Local 608, who was shot in the buttocks on May 7, 1986, in
the lobby of a midtown office building.
   The prosecution says Gotti ordered O'Connor shot because he
hired goons to wreck a mob-affiliated restaurant that was being
built with non-union labor.
   Cutler disputed that McElroy met Gotti at DeCicco's wake: ``You
met Mr. Gotti in your dreams, didn't you, Mr. McElroy?''
   Gotti, 49, and Anthony Guerrieri, 60, are being tried in state
court on charges of assault and conspiracy in O'Connor's shooting.
   O'Connor, who refused to testify at the trial, has been indicted
on larceny, perjury and extortion charges, partly in connection
with the destruction of the restaurant.
   McElroy, who is serving 60 years in federal prison, said he is
testifying against Gotti in the hope that prosecutors will have
mercy on his girlfriend, Francine Mostyn, 43, who was arrested on
drug charges along with McElroy.
   McElroy, an admitted former drug addict and a heavy drinker,
said that he was hung over and unable to go with three other
Westies members to shoot O'Connor on the scheduled morning.
Instead, they shot O'Connor the next day.

it's a case where our health is at stake, our safety's at stake.''
   As the search for new, dry digs continues, a bucket brigade is
catching copious leaks throughout the 10-year-old building,
Fletcher said.
   ``The walls are starting to crumble up pretty good,'' he said.
``The water, when it comes in now it comes in such large volumes we
have a platoon of people on the water detail trying to get the
water off the floor.''
   ``The chief does get a direct hit once in a while on his desk
and he has a plastic sheet to put over his papers,'' Fletcher said.
   After taking a tour of the waterlogged one-story station last
week, Mayor Martin J. Dunn ordered a move.
   ``The general condition of the building has deteriorated to such
an extent that we have to move out of there. Within weeks we'll be
out of there,'' Dunn said.
   But officials agree that finding a new headquarters won't be
easy, particularly as Massachusetts' fiscal woes make scarce state
funds for this old mill city.
   Police Chief Russell J. Paquette, who has emptied a few pails
himself, said money will simply have to be found.
   ``Somewhere along the line they're going to have to do
something,'' he said.
   All told, about 30 plastic buckets, barrels and assorted trash
cans are catching drips, along with makeshift plastic cones that
direct leaks to containers.
   ``It leaks down behind my desk and puddles down under my feet
and this isn't the worst part of the building,'' Paquette said.
   The water problems have damaged phone lines and electric
equipment, sometimes preventing people from calling in to the
dispatcher, Paquette said.
   One night, Paquette's office suddenly went dark for a few
minutes.
   ``I was scared to touch the switch. I was afraid I might get a
little tickle,'' the chief joked.
   Problems at the concrete building, funded by a federal grant of
$2 million, began before it opened in 1980, Paquette said. The
roof, which was originally constructed for parking, has been
patched several times.
   An out-of-court settlement was reached with the design firm some
years ago, but that wasn't enough to fix the problems, Dunn said.
   Abandoning the building will mean leaving behind expensive
bulletproof glass and electrically-locked doors installed in the
holding cell area, the chief said.
   That area is one of the driest in the building, so prisoners
haven't been as affected by the leaks as officers, Fletcher said.

<HEAD>Noriega Can Play Handball in New Prison</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Deposed dictator Manuel Noriega has been confined
to a cell with only a bed, wash basin, toilet and writing table,
but is being allowed to play handball during his daily hour of
exercise in a 15-by-15-foot metal cage.
   The former Panamanian leader, awaiting trial on 12
drug-trafficking counts, will spend the rest of his day in
isolation in the 86-square-foot cell in the medium-security
Metropolitan Correctional Center 25 miles south of Miami.
   He was moved to the federal prison Sunday from the federal
courthouse in Miami. He has no television in his cell.
   In the prison, where there are some maximum-security cells,
Noriega is allowed to go into the 15-by-15-foot cage for one hour a
day to exercise, prison spokesman Charles Davis said Monday.
   ``He can play handball against a wall, or walk around or do
calisthenics,'' Davis said. ``But he won't be engaged in any team
sports. He'll be out there by himself.''
   In court Monday, Noriega's attorney, Steven Kollin, reiterated
that the prison is not the proper place for his client, who he says
is a prisoner of war.
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler set a trial date for
March 5, but conceded that date was not realistic. He set a status
conference for Thursday.
   Hoeveler also delayed a decision until Thursday on requests that
two of Noriega's co-defendants _ former Panamanian Lt. Col. Luis
del Cid, 46, and Daniel Miranda, 36, _ be released on bond.

<HEAD>Three Storms Spread Rain, Snow, Cold</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Three storms today brought wind, snow and frigid temperatures to
the Great Lakes region, heavy snows and rain to New England and the
East Coast and wind and rain to the Pacific Northwest.
   An Arctic front churned toward the Great Lakes, bringing snow
squalls to Michigan, Wisconsin and northern Minnesota. Temperatures
dropped as much as 20 degrees as the front spread across the upper
Midwest with winds of 20 to 40 mph, spawning wind chills as low as
minus 50 from Montana to Minnesota.
   Heavy snow in New England's mountains was expected to taper off
today. Predictions called for a total of 15 to 20 inches of
snowfall in northeastern Vermont.
   Winter road accidents killed at least nine people in Oregon and
New York state on Monday.
   In New York, more than a foot of snow in some areas mixed with
rain and sleet to make traveling hazardous, leaving at least six
people dead.
   Mild weather was expected to melt most of the state's new snow,
though forecasts called for colder weather to return by the weekend.
   Snowy road conditions on U.S. Highway 97 in Oregon were blamed
for a pair of wrecks Monday that claimed the lives three
Californians, state police said. High winds and rain were predicted
in western Oregon and California north of San Francisco for today.
Rain was expected to change to snow in the Olympic Mountains and
elsewhere in northwestern Washington.
   The Cascades and northern Sierra braced for more heavy snow.
   The southern Rockies and Southwest states expected dry, mild
conditions today with above-normal temperatures and mostly sunny
skies.
   Louisiana and coastal Texas looked for fog today. Florida was
due for a few showers.
   On Monday, winds gusted to 48 mph at Bern, Ind., after a 6-inch
snowfall. Roads were blocked by snowdrifts up to 5 feet deep.
   Monday thunderstorms produced hail the size of golf balls near
Martinez, Ga. A tornado touched down northeast of Blythe, Ga.,
overturning seven trailers and injuring 6 persons.
   High temperature records for Jan. 29 broken Monday included
readings of 35 at International Falls, Minn., and Negaunee, Mich.
Miami Beach's 82 degrees also set a record for the date.
   The coldest reading in the Lower 48 states on Monday was minus 9
at Warroad, Minn.
   Monday's hot spots were Fort Myers and Vero Beach, Fla., both
with 85 degrees.

<HEAD>Penalty For Refusing Military Service Cut In Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will reduce the
mandatory sentences of white men convicted of refusing compulsory
military service from six years to as few as three years, officials
announced.
   Military service by blacks is voluntary.
   Defense Minister Magnus Malan said Monday night that the
decision was in keeping with the recent decision to cut compulsory
military service for white men from two years to one year.
   Both moves follow announcements of major spending cuts in the $4
billion military budget. Officials said the cuts can be made
because of reduced racial tension.
   Since taking office on Sept. 20, President F.W. De Klerk has
been making conciliatory moves toward the opposition fighting his
white-led government's policy of racial separation known as
apartheid.
   Under the new sentencing rules, religious objectors would do
three years of community service. Conscientious objectors could
have their prison terms reduced to three years based on good
behavior and other factors, Malan said.
   Conscientious objectors convicted of refusing to serve now
receive an automatic six-year prison term. Men who decline to serve
for religious reasons are required to perform six years of
community service.
   ``It is only fair and right that the alleviation of military
service, which has already been announced, be made applicable to
religious objectors and those who refuse to render military
service,'' Malan said.
   Three conscientious objectors are now serving six-year prison
terms. At least 800 white men have publicly stated their refusal to
perform military duty but have not been prosecuted.
   Many young white men who leave South Africa cite mandatory
military service as one of the main reasons.
   The End Conscription Campaign, a group opposed to mandatory
military service, said it welcomed the change. But it said it wants
the government also to allow conscientious objectors to do
community service.

<HEAD>Defense Budget `No Longer a Sacred Cow,' Members of Congress Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs of new Cheney quotes after 5th graf, `We are'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney must
convincingly argue that his $292.1 billion military budget is the
proper U.S. response to changes in the Soviet threat, members of
Congress say, and even then lawmakers may be unwilling to go along.
   ``The defense budget is no longer a sacred cow,'' Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the House Armed Services
Committee, said Monday after Cheney spelled out his military
spending plan for fiscal 1991.
   The defense secretary, citing a diminished conventional threat
from the Warsaw Pact nations and budget constraints at home,
proposed an increase from this year's $286.8 billion in outlays to
$292.1 billion _ a 2 percent reduction after adjusting for
anticipated inflation.
   But at the same time, Cheney emphasized that the Soviet Union
continues to modernize its strategic forces and the United States
cannot abandon its own high-tech weapons such as the B-2 stealth
bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``We are going to retain and require deterrent capability in
terms of our strategic forces for the indefinite future. That will
not change,'' Cheney told reporters at a Pentagon briefing on the
budget.
   Elaborating on that point on NBC's ``Today'' show this morning,
Cheney said most of the changes seen so far in the Soviet military
posture involve a winding down of conventional forces rather than
reducing strategic weapons.
   ``I think the test now will be to see whether or not Congress
makes the right kinds of difficult decisions, that is to say to cut
overhead in some of those things that are important ... political
considerations back home while we preserve the essence of our
military capability,'' Cheney said of proposed base closings.
   ``At home, if we are going to reduce force structure ... then
it's also important to reduce the base structure that supports
those. You simply don't need as many bases if you're going to have
a smaller Army,'' he said.
   The defense secretary testifies on Capitol Hill later this week,
and spelling out his strategy will be the key with lawmakers.
   ``In my view, Congress will be more likely to go along with
these tough decisions if Secretary Cheney can give us a clear
vision of where defense policies and programs are going over the
next five years in light of the changes in the threat and our
overall strategy,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Not surprisingly, the defense secretary garnered quick support
from several Republican lawmakers.
   ``We can't let the dramatic changes in Europe completely turn
upside down planning for the future,'' said Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services panel.
   It would be ``highly risky if Congress went in and made
unilateral cuts,'' Warner said, considering the instability in the
Soviet Union, the constant threat of terrorism and lack of changes
in the Third World.
   The Bush administration's plan calls for five B-2 bombers at a
cost of $5.5 billion, numbers certain to draw fire on Capitol Hill
where lawmakers have complained loudly about the radar-evading
plane considered the most expensive in history at about $530
million a copy.
   ``The B-2 is the first victim of the Berlin Wall,'' Schroeder
said.
   The budget also includes $4.5 billion for SDI, popularly known
as Star Wars. The total represents a $1 billion increase over last
year when Congress adopted _ and the administration accepted _ the
first reduction in spending for SDI since President Reagan
introduced the antimissile shield six years ago.
   ``I'm absolutely astounded by the amount asked for SDI,'' said
Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., a senior member of the House Armed
Services Committee. ``Admiral (William J.) Crowe said $3 billion is
a generous figure.'' Crowe retired last year as chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The defense budget would continue financing of two land-based
nuclear missiles, with $2.8 billion to fund rail-basing for the
multiple-warhead MX missile and $202 million for the truck-based,
single-warhead Midgetman.
   The budget also calls for $1.2 billion to involve the U.S.
military more deeply in Bush's anti-drug war and to give a 3.5
percent military pay raise.
   The document envisions a smaller U.S. military force, paring
38,000 men and women from the 2 million in uniform, primarily from
attrition in the Army and the Air Force. That step would bring the
active duty force down to roughly equal its 1980 size.
   The plan calls for doing away with some 20 small weapons
systems, such as the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and the Army's M-1
tank, in an attempt to save $2.9 billion. Others cuts include the
Navy's F-14D jet fighter, the Phoenix and Maverick missiles, the
Apache helicopter, the Army Helicopter Improvement Program and the
F-15E fighter.
   The Navy would lose two of its four battleships from the World
War II era, the USS Iowa and USS New Jersey, for an estimated
savings of $75 million.
   The most controversial aspect of the budget is the proposal that
at this time has no savings attached. It is a plan to close or
scale back more than 72 domestic installations and end U.S.
operations at 12 facilities overseas.
   Among the major bases targeted are Fort Ord in California, Fort
McClellan in Alabama and the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. A
significant number of facilities are located in California.

   Ford Motor Co. infringed on a former
professor's patent for the intermittent windshield wiper used on
its cars, a jury ruled in a potentially far-reaching and lucrative
case for the inventor.
   The verdict Monday could affect similar lawsuits by Robert W.
Kearns against General Motors Corp., Chrysler Corp., Daimler-Benz,
Honda, Toyota, Nissan and 21 other companies. The Ford case was the
first to go to trial.
   The federal jury will reconvene Feb. 26 to establish how much
Ford must pay Kearns.
   However, U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn ruled earlier that
Kearns failed to prove he could have made and marketed the system
on his own and thus can claim only a royalty on each wiper, instead
of Ford's profit.
   Ford had contended the patent was invalid because the windshield
system contained no new concepts.
   But Kearns argued a new combination of parts made his invention
unique. The invention allow the driver to set the interval at which
the wiper sweeps the window.
   The jury decided that Kearns' patent was valid.
   Kearns claimed in his lawsuit that he installed a set of his
wipers on a 1962 Ford and took it to the automaker.
   Kearns ``made numerous disclosures of confidential engineering
test designs'' to Ford engineers, the lawsuit claimed. Because they
repeatedly asked him to discuss designs, the lawsuit said, Kearns
was led to believe Ford would buy his system.
   Kearns, his attorneys and Ford all said they were forbidden by
the judge to talk about the 12-year-old case.
   Kearns, a former professor at Wayne State University in Detroit
who now lives in Gaithersburg, Md., obtained the patents between
1967 and 1974.

   When a convenience store clerk found himself
looking at the business end of two pistols, he did the sensible
thing _ he bought them.
   A gunman came into the store Friday night, plunked down a can of
beer, pulled out the guns and demanded cash. That's when Wazir Jiwi
decided to bargain.
   ``I said, `You don't need two. Why don't you sell me one of
them?''' Jiwi said.
   The robber thought about it for a moment and named his price _
$100. As Jiwi placed the pistol under the counter, he pushed a
button automatically locking the door of the store. Then, he
bartered for the other gun.
   ``He didn't want to give it to me. But I figured he needed the
money, and I told him I would pay him for it,'' Jiwi said.
   The robber grabbed the cash, put the other pistol on the counter
and headed for the door but couldn't open it.
   ``He turned to me and asked what was going on. I told him to
bring the money back and I would let him go,'' Jiwi said. ``He
brought the money back, and I opened the door.''
   The robber was still at large this morning, police said.

   Communist chief Petar Mladenov today said
Bulgaria's economy was falling apart and that ousted hard-line
ruler Todor Zhivkov was brutal, selfish and stupid.
   Mladenov told Communist Party congress that their party faced
extinction unless it agreed to reforms to promote democracy or
stabilize an economy ``in tatters.''
   He also hinted he would step down and reiterated a plan for an
interim government that included emerging pro-democracy groups.
   Mladenov said only such a coalition government is ``capable of
leading the country out of the crisis.''
   But he gave no specifics on what share of power the Communists
would retain in such an administration.
   Opposition leaders and some reform Communists doubted the
leadership, which threw out Zhivkov on Nov. 10 after 35 years of
uncontested rule, was sincere about genuine change.
   ``They want to change anything but their chairs _ the name of
the party, even their ideals,'' said Lyubomir Pavlov, a senior
member of the independent trade union Podkrepa, before the congress.
   The leadership has promised multiparty democracy with the first
free parliamentary elections in more than 40 years in May, although
the opposition has wanted it delayed until November to give it more
time to organize.
   Many of the 2,790 delegates cheered when Mladenov rejected the
opposition calls, insisting they be held ``not later than May.''
   Mladenov appeared to try to exploit divisions within the still
weak opposition by reiterating calls for a new ``government of
national concord'' before the May elections.
   Some opposition leaders reject this idea outright, arguing that
they do not want to be responsible for the chaos caused by four
decades of Communist rule, while others have suggested they might
participate in such an interim cabinet.
   Mladenov was at his most forthright in criticizing the rule of
Zhivkov, who has been arrested on charges of misappropriation of
state property, inciting ethnic hostility and grave abuse of power.
   He variously described the former leader, under whom he served
as foreign minister for 18 years, as ``a maniac,'' ``egoist,'' a
``bearer of a painful suspiciousness and selfishness'' and a man
``without any intellectual capacities.''
   Mladenov hinted he may make way for a new party chief when he
suggested the congress vote to split the posts of party chief and
president, which he assumed when Zhivkov was ousted.
   ``It's my suggestion that the comrades adopt a decision that the
same person should not be leading the party and the state at the
same time,'' he said.
   There had been unconfirmed speculation that Mladenov might stay
on as president but give up the party job. In Poland, which blazed
the trail of democratic reform in the East bloc, Wojciech
Jaruzelski resigned as Communist Party chief before Solidarity took
control of the government and now holds the post of president.
   In the speech, Mladenov made no mention of ongoing talks with
the opposition Union of Democratic Forces to put Bulgaria on the
road toward democracy.
   His lack of new proposals confirmed opposition fears that the
party leadership, while ready for moderate reforms, must take into
account the conservative mainstream of the party in order to
maintain power.
   Despite his remarks on democracy, Mladenov asserted that
Bulgaria's Communists, whose power has remained more intact than
that of their comrades elsewhere in Eastern Europe, were the only
party capable of changing society.
   With East Germany's Erich Honecker, Zhivkov is one of two
deposed East bloc leaders charged with crimes.
   Ousted Politburo member Milko Balev, a Zhivkov loyalist, and
Ivan Slavkov, Zhivkov's son-in-law, were reportedly under
investigation for possession of funds they could not explain.
Slavkov was also charged with illegal possession of weapons. It was
unclear if Slavkov, long the head of the Bulgarian Olympic
Committee, and Balev were in custody.
   This extraordinary party congress was moved up from 1991 to cope
with growing threats to Communist power in Bulgaria.
   Two weeks ago, the Communist-controlled legislature followed
Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia in amending the
constitution to strip the Communist Party of its guaranteed leading
role in society.
   In Poland and Hungary, Communist parties that ruled for four
decades have dissolved and formed new groupings to distance
themselves from their repressive pasts.
   The Communist parties in East Germany and Czechoslovakia are
still intact, though their power is eroding.

   Researchers unveiled a prototype computer
that uses light instead of electrical impulses to process data and
said it could be as revolutionary as the transistor, which ushered
in the computer age.
   The computer that Bell Laboratories displayed Monday is crude,
with enough power only to operate something like a dishwasher.
Within a decade, however, it could lead to development of
light-based supercomputers operating at least 1,000 times faster
than current machines, perhaps even 10,000 times, said Brian
Monahan, a spokesman for Bell Labs.
   ``This stage says it can be done,'' said Bob Trier, technical
program director for Research Consortium Inc. of Minneapolis, which
studies high-performance computing. ``The next stage is to find out
what can be done with this technology.''
   For years, researchers have been looking at photons, the
fundamental particles of light, as replacements for electrons in
electronic equipment. Such a shift promises computers vastly more
agile and powerful than today's machines.
   The prototype data processor is the first to transmit
information with light rather than electricity, the movement of
electrons. The technique could allow a much greater flow of data.
   ``Your only limit when it comes to those things is the speed of
light,'' said Jim Hammons, an analyst at The Sierra Group computer
consulting firm in Tempe, Ariz.
   Unlike current computer chips, information would pass not just
from a chip's edges but also from its surface. Bell Labs physicist
David Miller likened the development to a Manhattan island in New
York City where cars suddenly weren't limited to bridges and
tunnels at rush hour, but could leave through the air.
   By the end of the decade, supercomputers could be using more
light, or ``photonic,'' components rather than electronic, and may
run at least 1,000 times faster than today's generation, Monahan
said.
   The prototype _ a variety of lasers, lenses and prisms in a
2-foot-square box _ differs from a true computer in that the
program that runs the optical processor is built into its hardware
rather than being contained in software, said Bell Labs spokeswoman
Marj McKean. It also has limited memory, she said.
   She said the processor originally took up three large lab
benches. Eventually, scientists believe it can be reduced to the
size of today's microchips, no larger than a fingernail.
   Transmitting light impulses, as fiber optics do, is nothing new,
but controlling them is another thing.
   ``They have found a way to hold a piece of light,'' said Trier.
   The photonic computer depends on new chips that pass light
impulses between each other through lenses that perform the
function of wires, Bell Labs officials said.
   Officials at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., which owns Bell
Labs, likened the development to that of the transistor, which made
it possible to make electronic devices smaller, sturdier and more
reliable. The transistor was developed at Bell Labs in 1947.

<HEAD>Shamir Aide: Israel Isn't Urging Soviet Jews to Settle in Occupied
Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
denied today that Israel urged Soviet Jews to settle in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have been
fighting for independence.
   ``It has not been our policy and will not be in the future.
Anyone who comes to Israel can go wherever he chooses,'' said Yossi
Ben-Aharon, the head of Shamir's office.
   Ben-Aharon said better employment opportunities are attracting
Soviet immigrants to the center of the country, and that only a few
hundred immigrants out of a total of 12,000 last year chose to live
on the land captured from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   Ben-Aharon responded to Soviet and U.S. criticism of Shamir's
statement earlier this month suggesting Israel has to retain the
occupied territoriesto settle the expected wave of Soviet
immigrants.
   In Moscow, a top Soviet Foreign Ministry official summoned
Israel's top diplomat, Arye Levin, to ``strongly condemn
endangering Soviet emigres by using them to crowd Palestinians out
of their own land,'' the Soviet news agency Tass said Monday.
   The official, First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov,
suggested that settling Soviet immigrants in the disputed areas
could forestall Moscow's plans to further liberalize emigration
laws and allow more Jews to come to Israel.
   Levin, who flew to Israel today for what he described as a
``family visit,'' told reporters he was not under the impression
that the Soviets were threatening to curtail immigration.
   Another Shamir aide, Avi Pazner, suggested that the Soviets were
trying to allay fears by Palestinians and Arab leaders.
   ``The Arabs are exerting heavy pressure on the Russians
concerning the immigration and Mr. Shamir expressed his hope that
the artificial storm would pass,'' Pazner said.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher was quoted by
the Jerusalem Post as telling reporters in Washington Monday that
``putting even more settlers into the territories is an obstacle to
the cause of peace.''
   Israeli legislators and Soviet Jewish activists in Israel have
accused Shamir of endangering Jewish immigration at a time of
growing concern about anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.
   Yitzhak Abrahmson, head of a Soviet immigrants group, said on
Israel Radio he was worried that Shamir's statement about using
occupied land for new arrivals would lead to a Soviet clampdown on
issuing exit visas.
   Three left-wing parties have filed no-confidence motions in the
Knesset, or Parliament, to protest Shamir's remark.
   In a related development, the head of a Soviet diplomatic
delegation in Israel, Georgi Martirosov, blamed Shamir for the
delay in resuming direct flights between the Soviet Union and
Israel.
   Such flights could be a boost to Soviet immigration to Israel
because it would channel all Jews leaving Moscow directly to Tel
Aviv. In the past, many have stayed in Europe and sought refuge in
Western countries.
   Chances of implementing such an agreement are ``zero'' and
Shamir's statements ``hindered any possibility of moving this
process forward,'' Martirosov was quoted as saying by the Jerusalem
Post.
   Moscow broke diplomatic ties with Israel over its occupation of
Arab territory in the 1967 Middle East war. It supports Palestinian
demands for an independent state in the occupied lands and says the
restoration of full ties with Israel is conditional on progress in
Middle East peace efforts.

<TEXT>
   Faced with a soaring federal health care bill,
the Bush administration is proposing incentives in its new budget
to encourage lower-cost and preventive care.
   The incentives would be built into the Medicare and Medicaid
health insurance programs to help stem spiraling cost increases
that have driven combined spending in the two programs to $148
billion this year.
   The budget would encourage ``managed care'' _ that is, health
maintenance organizations and physicians' networks that treat
patients under a single, comprehensive organization designed to
save costs.
   ``We are bullish on managed care,'' Kevin Moley, assistant
secretary for management and budget at the Department of Health and
Human Services, said Monday.
   Under President Bush's proposed fiscal 1991 budget, spending for
Medicare and Medicaid would increase to $110.5 billion for Medicare
and $45 billion for Medicaid.
   But spending growth in the programs would be trimmed by about
$5.5 billion from what they would otherwise spend without changes
in the programs. Growth would be stemmed by paring payments to
hospitals and physicians.
   For both the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the administration
wants to encourage managed care plans as alternatives to the
traditional fee-for-service health care delivery systems.
   Government health economists say HMOs and preferred provider
organizations, called PPOs, put more emphasis on preventive care
and are more efficient than traditional systems.
   The administration is proposing financial incentives for states
to enroll Medicaid recipients in HMOs.
   In the Medicare program, the administration wants to encourage
managed care by increasing the payment threshold for certain
approved HMOs from 95 percent of the cost of care to 100 percent.
   That would add about $180 million to the Medicare budget next
year, but would eventually reap benefits if more Medicare
recipients chose HMOs, which also protect against the financial
devastation of catastrophic illnesses.
   This proposal would reduce premiums for enrollees, but HHS
officials said they did not know by how much.
   Another proposal, called Medicare Plus, is being worked out to
help develop a market for PPOs by coordinating Medigap insurance
policies with these provider networks.
   As envisioned, the government would put its seal of approval on
PPOs that meet specified standards for comprehensiveness and
quality of care.
   Medicare will serve 31.4 million elderly and 3.3 million
disabled Americans in the 1991 fiscal year, according to HHS
figures. The Medicaid program, a federal and state effort, covers
about 26 million of the nation's poor.
   The Bush administration also proposed increasing AIDS spending
for research, prevention and education by about 7 percent to $1.7
billion. Total AIDS spending by HHS and other federal agencies _
including Medicare and Medicaid payments to AIDS patients _ would
rise 18 percent to nearly $3.5 billion.
   The National Organizations Responding to AIDS denounced the
increase in research and prevention efforts as ``woefully
insufficient, particularly in the face of the doubling caseload
this nation will be experiencing during the next year.''

   A woman was sentenced to 10 months in jail for
stabbing her fiance in the neck with a barbecue fork after he
switched channels on her to watch the Super Bowl.
   ``You were almost a football widow,'' Judge Ted Poe told Viola
Delores Douglas, 37, after she pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanor
assault.
   As Ms. Douglas explained it, she was watching a Disney movie
Sunday when Eddie Harris, an asphalt firm worker, returned to the
apartment they share and switched to the Super Bowl.
   Ms. Douglas attacked Harris with a knife, but he disarmed her
and escaped injury, prosecutor Don Rizzo said. Not long after, she
told police, she returned to the room and discovered that Harris
was ignoring the game.
   An infuriated Ms. Douglas stabbed him, prosecutors said.
   Harris required a few stitches to close the wound.
   The unemployed nurse could be eligible for release after about
five months.

<HEAD>Ceausescu Deposted 40 Tons of Gold in Swiss Account, Ex-Policeman
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former policeman said he helped
escort 40 tons of gold to Switzerland so it could be deposited in
Nicolae Ceausescu's bank account, the state news agency said today.
   The official Rompress news agency quoted an unidentified former
police official who said he was on a September 1980 flight that
carried 25 tons of gold ingots and an October 1980 flight that
carried 15 tons.
   The gold, escorted by security officers and finance ministry
officials, was loaded in trucks in Zurich in the presence of
Romanian diplomats, the police official reportedly said.
   He estimated that Ceausescu had deposited about $400 million in
gold in Swiss banks, but other sources put the figure at $1 billion
dollars, Rompress said.
   Ceausescu was toppled by a violent uprising in December and
executed on Dec. 25 after 24 years in power. There have been
numerous reports that he and his family lived in excessive luxury
while Romanians endured poverty and oppression.
   The daily Romania Libera called on former Ceausescu aides who
took part in alleged smuggling of gold or Western cash to help the
new authorities recover ``the tremendous values transferred
abroad'' by the former dictator.
   Swiss lawmakers have pledged to help in tracing hundreds of
millions of dollars that Ceausescu reportedly hid in Swiss or other
foeign banks, but said there was not yet proof of any momey had
been transferred to Switzerland.
   Henrich Rittmeyer, a Swiss lawmaker who visited Bucharest in
mid-January, said the process of finding Ceausescu's missing
millions could be difficult.
   ``It's extremely difficult,'' he told a news conference Jan. 14.
``The Romanian government and Romanian bank representatives don't
know yet how much money is missing.''
   He added that if Ceausescu had smuggled a fortune out of
Romania, it was ``probable'' some of it could be found in Swiss
accounts, but said the process could take years.

   Police fired rubber bullets
and tear gas today to prevent more than 1,000 blacks from
protesting an English cricket team that broke an international
boycott, witnesses said.
   Obed Nkosi, an organizer for the anti-apartheid National Sports
Council, claimed 30 people were hurt in the black township of
Mangaung outside the central city of Bloemfontein.
   Police said 45 people were arrested and one white businessman
was slightly injured when his vehicle was stoned by protesters.
   The demonstrators sought to march from Mangaung to the sports
stadium in Bloemfontein, where the British squad was facing South
African university players.
   But police roadblocks prevented the activists from leaving the
township, and some of the youths began throwing stones at
authorities and setting up barricades of burning tires, witnesses
said.
   Police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and baton
charges, the witnesses added.
   ``The situation is very tense,'' Nkosi said.
   The managing director of the South African Cricket Union, Ali
Bacher, later obtained permission from a magistrate so
demonstrators could march outside the stadium. About 200 did so
without incident.
   Bacher, who arranged the English tour, has said that
demonstrators should be allowed to protest peacefully outside the
stadiums while the matches are in progress.
   Activists have been staging protests since the Jan. 19 arrival
of the English squad, which is on a six-week tour of South Africa.
The team is defying a ban on sporting links with South Africa,
imposed to protest the country's apartheid policies of racial
segregation.
   The English team, led by Mike Gatting, began its second
three-day match Tuesday. The hundreds of police at the stadium
outnumbered spectators when the match began.
   The English players face expulsion from international cricket
for five years for taking part in the tour. According to news
reports, they are receiving $160,000 each.

   A pro-government newspaper
today said President F.W. de Klerk plans to ease the 43-month-old
state of emergency and lift restrictions on the media.
   The Citizen newspaper said de Klerk will announce the changes
Friday at an address before Parliament but he is not expected to
release jailed black leader Nelson Mandela until mid-February at
the earliest.
   There has been an surge in political unrest recently, and the
government is concerned that freeing Mandela could set off violence
among the disenfranchised black majority.
   The Citizen, which has good contacts within the government, said
the immediate release of Mandela also would distract attention from
de Klerk's speech to Parliament, when he is expected to outline his
plans for reform.
   The newspaper said the president is likely to remove press
restrictions that are part of the wide-ranging emergency measures
in effect since June 1986. The media curbs, which have not been
widely enforced, prohibit reporting on unrest and some forms of
protest.
   However, de Klerk will maintain some of the emergency security
measures to quell unrest, the newspaper said.
   In the latest incident, police today fired tear gas and rubber
bullets to disperse about 1,000 black demonstrators, some of whom
threw stones and erected barricades of burning tires in the
Mangaung township near the central city of Bloemfontein. Police
reported 45 arrests.
   The blacks were seeking to leave the township and march on a
sports stadium where an English cricket team was playing in
defiance of a ban on sports contacts with South Africa.
   An activist said 30 of the demonstrators were hurt, but
witnesses said they saw no serious injuries or mass arrests.
   Police also used tear gas Tuesday to disperse 150 black
squatters protesting their eviction from the ''whites-only''
neighborhood of Kraaifontein outside Cape Town. No arrests or
injuries were reported.
   Police Gen. Herman Stadler said the recent increase in unrest
was a result of the government's more relaxed attitude toward
political dissent.
   ``There is a wave of unrest at the moment,'' Stadler said.
``Expectations are created, and people are inclined to come to the
fore and apply pressure.''
   Anti-apartheid activists have planned demonstrations in Cape
Town to coincide with the opening of Parliament and de Klerk's
speech. Police have advised citizens to stay away from downtown
Cape Town, saying they may have to take action against the
demonstrators.
   The government has allowed peaceful protest since September by
marchers who have acquired permission in advance from a magistrate.
However, the activists in Cape Town have refused to apply.
   Organizers say they will demand the immediate release of
Mandela, the country's best known black leader. He has been
imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage
and plotting to overthrow the government.
   South African media have been awash in speculation on when
Mandela might be released and the issue is dominating political
life. Mandela is a leader of the African National Congress
guerrilla movement, the largest black group fighting the white-led
government.
   On Monday night, Defense Minister Magnus Malan said he
government will reduce the mandatory sentences of white men
convicted of refusing compulsory military service from six years to
as few as three years.
   Malan said the decision was in keeping with the recent decision
to cut compulsory military service for white men from two years to
one year.
   Military service by blacks is voluntary.

   The satirical movie by Michael Moore depicts Flint's decline

   An overwhelmingly pro-Moore crowd of about 2,000 showed up at
the ``Donahue'' taping Monday at a city auditorium, and so many

the tape over two shows.
   Some cities got the first show live Monday. The second segment

   ``There's a minority of people in this town that's very upset
the film was made. And they're not the people standing in the
cheese line,'' said Moore, a Flint native.
   A few in the audience said Moore's movie made Flint look worse

   GM, still Flint's biggest employer, was not represented at the
taping. The automaker sent Donahue a statement saying the movie was
unfair and inaccurate.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with
Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany today and appeared less
resistant to eventual Germany reunification, saying the matter
remains open to debate.
   Speaking to reporters at a news conference after their meeting,
Modrow said Gorbachev ``did not rule out such a prospect in the
future, and at the same time did not venture to set some time
limits for that.''
   Earlier, Gorbachev told reporters that any decisions must
include the four Allied powers and take into account European
opinions.
   ``The development of events in the world, in East Germany, in
the Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analytical
approach to deciding this problem,'' he said.
   ``Time itself is acting on this process, giving it dynamism,''
the Soviet leader said. ``We have to act responsibly, and not
decide this important question on the streets.''
   His remarks were reported by the Tass news agency. Asked by an
East German TV correspondent about his attitude toward
reunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and
that ``no one can cast doubt'' on the reasonableness of asking it,
Tass reported.
   However, the English-language Tass translation raised questions
whether Gorbachev meant that there could be no doubts about
reunification.
   The Soviet Union in past years has strongly opposed any talk of
German reunification, but has mellowed somewhat as Gorbachev
remolds foreign policy and democratic change sweeps Eastern Europe.
   Soviets now say that the question of German reunification is one
to be decided in the future.
   Gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meeting French
President Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated his
view that the existence of two German states is a fact based on the
outcome of World War II.
   But he added, ``The present situation is the result of specific
historical events, a specific historical process on this continent.
So, history should should decide the future of this continent.''
   He urged against rushing with a decision on reunification. ``I
don't think it is a topical question today. A different approach
may create a situation that would complicate the entire European
process, including the relations between the two German states,''
Gorbachev said at the time.
   Modrow said the two German states could work in a series of
stages toward a form of confederation, with no time limit set on it.
   He said he agreed with Gorbachev that the question of
reunification is not only one that must be decided by East and West
Germany, but by all of Europe.
   ``It's difficult to set some time limit, because it must be
supported by the European people, and that must be in line with the
treaty on the development of the confederation with all its
substance and implications,'' Modrow said.
   ``In light of that concept, the European nations will probably
understand it in the following way ... we must be very cautious
about the process,'' he added.
   According to the Tass report, the Soviet leader added that any
action taken on Germany reunification must not infringe on the
interests of either East or West Germany, the four Allied powers:
France, Britain, the United States or the Soviet Union, or anyone
else in Europe.
   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze joined Gorbachev for the meeting with Modrow, who
arrived in Moscow on a one-day visit late Monday.
   Modrow arrived after a stormy session of parliament in which the
East Germany prosecutor announced that former hard-line leader
Erich Honnecker will go on trial in March for treason.
   Modrow, a Communist, also has moved forward the country's first
free elections from May to March 18 and brought the opposition into
a coalition that will govern until then.

   Cripple Creek residents voted 152-38 over the weekend in favor
of gambling to support historic preservation and make other
improvements. The twin mountain towns of Black Hawk and Central
City, 40 miles west of Denver, also want gambling.
   All three towns would limit gambling licenses to their historic
districts, limit dollar amounts and restrict gambling to slot
machines, poker and blackjack.
   Two state legislators have said they will introduce a resolution
to put the proposed constitutional amendment on the November
ballot. But as now written, the resolution would allow gambling
only in Central City and Black Hawk.
   By 1904, some 14 years after gold was first found in the area,
the 24-square-mile Cripple Creek-Victor Mining District had 100,000
people and 200 bars, saloons and gambling parlors.
   Today there are about 15 bars, and the winter population is less
than 1 percent of the boom days total. Most businesses close in the
winter after a summer rush of about 200,000 people.
   ``We are dying on the grapevine. It gets dark every night and we
twiddle out thumbs'' while people take their money to Deadwood,
S.D., which began legalized gambling last year, said Black Hawk
Mayor Wilhelm Lorenz.

   A man who law enforcement sources said could
corroborate testimony that Mayor Marion Barry bought and smoked
crack cocaine pleaded guilty today to a drug-related charge.
   James McWilliams pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of
aiding and abetting drug possession before U.S. Magistrate Deborah
A. Robinson. The crime carries a maximum penalty of one year in
jail and a $100,000 fine.
   McWilliams has been described as a longtime friend of Charles
Lewis, a convicted drug dealer who has testified that he sold crack
to Barry and smoked it with him in December 1988.
   McWilliams and his attorney, Daniel Masur, declined to comment
on the plea. They were immediately taken by deputy U.S. marshals to
a grand jury meeting room.
   Barry, who has denied using drugs, was arrested in an FBI sting
operation on Jan. 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge for
allegedly smoking crack in a Washington hotel room. He is in a
private facility in Florida for what an aide says is primarily
treatment of alcoholism.
   McWilliams, a motor vehicles department employee, is expected to
appear before a grand jury investigating Barry's ties to Lewis,
according to a law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   McWilliams has told prosecutors he saw Barry and Lewis enter the
bathroom of Lewis' hotel room, where they allegedly smoked crack
cocaine before emerging a short time later, said a law enforcement
source.
   Allegations that Barry used cocaine in the past were also
supported by Carol Bland Jackson, a former business partner of the
woman who lured Barry into the FBI sting. She said in interviews
Monday that she and others used cocaine with Barry at a party in
1986.
   Lewis pleaded guilty in the nation's capital to cocaine
conspiracy charges last November and was convicted on cocaine
distribution charges in the Virgin Islands last spring.
   In meetings with prosecutors in the past week, McWilliams also
said the mayor called him after Barry's ties to Lewis became public
and told him he trusted him to keep quiet about what he had seen in
the hotel room, two law enforcement sources said.
   Barry has said he only called McWilliams to urge him to
cooperate with authorities investigating the case.
   Sources have said that in addition to McWilliams, members of
Barry's police security detail are expected to appear before the
grand jury investigating the mayor.
   The police officers _ who are assigned to the mayor on a
round-the-clock basis _ are expected to be asked whether they saw
Barry use drugs during his visits to Lewis' hotel room or on other
occasions, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the
case.
   R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's attorney, said he was unaware of any
deal McWilliams may have struck with prosecutors.

   A boy whose kidnappers cut off his finger to
persuade his drug-dealing older brother to pay up to $500,000
ransom was found dead wrapped in trash bags, two weeks after the
brother was discovered slain, police said.
   The body of 12-year-old William Porter was found in 14 layers of
black plastic bags Sunday by a man collecting cans on a bike path
in the Bronx.
   The boy was killed by a blow to the head, said Ellen Borakove, a
spokeswoman for the city medical examiner. The death was classified
a homicide, she said.
   Police said Monday they believe the boy was kidnapped Dec. 5 in
an attempt to extort money from his older brother, reputed drug
dealer Richard Thomas Porter, who was found shot to death Jan. 4 in
the same area.
   Detectives speculated at the time that the elder Porter, who had
refused to cooperate with the police investigation, may have been
trying to obtain the boy's release on his own.
   William's 25-year-old brother was reputed to control several
street dealers in Harlem. He was found shot in the head and chest.
His wallet, with more than $2,000 in it, was found on his body.
   The kidnappers demanded up to $500,000 for the youngster's
return in a series of telephone calls, notes and a taped message
from the boy on Dec. 5 and 6.
   A police source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
one of the ransom demands included William's severed right index
finger and a short taped message, which were left in a coffee cup
in a restaurant bathroom.
   ``They cutted my finger off,'' the sixth-grader cried on the
tape, according to police. ``Please help. ... I love you, mommy.''
   The last contact with the kidnappers occurred Dec. 10, when a
woman handed a note to a child to deliver it to William's aunt, who
lived in the area. The note said the boy was in pain and needed
medical attention, police said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Says Ship Carrying 19 Sunk in Storm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greek-registered ship carrying 19 crew members
and a load of cement apparently sank in a storm in the English
Channel, the coast guard said today.
   The coast guard said two lifeboats and a life raft from the ship
Flag Theofano and two bodies washed ashore on England's south
coast. One body was identified as a Greek crew member.
   The coast guard said the vessel left Le Havre, France, on Monday
afternoon for Southampton with its crew of 11 Greeks, seven
Maldivians and one Egyptian. The last contact with the ship was at
7:35 p.m. Monday, the coast guard said, and no mayday call was
received.
   A Royal Navy diver searched the water five miles south of
Portsmouth where the coast guard said an oil slick, air bubbles and
a rope attached to something below the water's surface were found.
   ``We put a diver down, but from 6 meters (19 feet) he couldn't
see his hand in front of his face,'' said a coast guard spokesman,
who was not further identified in keeping with British custom.
   Divers were waiting for the weather to improve to begin their
search for the 324-foot-long, 1,184-ton ship.
   Nick Palmer, a spokesman for the ship's agents, Wainwright and
Brothers, said the ship sailed despite poor forecasts.
   ``The cargo was urgently needed and for that reason the captain
decided to sail for Southampton,'' Palmer said. ``If a full-scale
search cannot find a ship that big, there is not much hope.''
   A spokesman for Lloyd's of London insurance market said the ship
was built in 1970 and is owned by Seawave Compania Nanera, a Greek
company.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to their highest level since
October.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.7 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.77 percent, up from 7.66 percent
last week. Another $7.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.73 percent, up from 7.58 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.78
percent on Oct. 30, 1989, and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent
on Oct. 2, 1989. Three-month bills also sold for 7.77 percent on
Dec. 26, 1989.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.04 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,803.60 and 8.16 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,609.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 8.01
percent last week from 7.97 percent the previous week.

   New Yorkers are used to being told what they
can't do in public spaces: No parking. No dogs. No smoking. No
spitting. No left turn.
   But no weddings?
   That's what a sign on an East River pier seems to indicate, but
a spokesman for the Department of Ports and Trades wants lovers to
know the city is not getting into the wedding-busting business.
   The sign, using the international symbol for prohibition, has a
bride and groom inside a circle with a slash through it.
   ``It's a funky sign and we made it in a fun way,'' department
spokesman Frances Resheske said today. ``We didn't mean to imply
that weddings are prohibited, just that people are not allowed to
close off the pier to the public.''
   Resheske said many couples holding receptions at an adjacent
restaurant in the borough of Queens were led to believe they could
hold private ceremonies on the pier.
   The pier has an unobstructed view of the Manhattan skyline and
has become a popular pedestrian walkway for local residents _ and a
wedding hot spot.
   ``We were getting complaints that it was being closed many
Saturdays and Sundays in the summer,'' said Resheske.
   ``We're not anti-weddings. If someone wanted to go out tomorrow
with a judge and get married on the pier, fine. ... You just can't
close it off.''
   Violators can be fined up to $5,000.

   Security was tight today at the opening of the
trial of a black man accused of murdering a white teacher _ a case
linked to the mail-bomb slayings of a judge and a lawyer.
   Extra guards were called in and spectators arriving for the
trial of Emmanuel Fitzgerald Hammond had to pass through metal
detectors in the lobby and at the courtroom entrance. Guards also
searched purses and brief cases.
   Hammond is charged with murder, kidnapping and armed robbery in
the shotgun slaying of preschool teacher Julie Love. Prosecutors
are seeking the death penalty.
   Security was heavy because of the attention given to the
year-long search for the victim, whose body was found last summer,
and because of a letter claiming a federal judge and a civil rights
lawyer were ``assassinated'' in retaliation for Love's death.
   ``I don't think we've had any threats,'' said sheriff's Capt.
J.C. Booker. ``This is just a precaution.''
   Superior Court Judge Ralph Hicks this morning delayed the start
of jury selection at the request of prosecutors, who asked defense
attorney William A. Wehunt to reveal whether he plans an insanity
defense.
   Wehunt said he had not been able to talk to psychologists who
examined Hammond to determine ``how extensive the use of drugs has
affected this man's mental powers.'' Hicks granted a recess so that
Wehunt could contact the doctors.
   A letter signed by ``Americans For a Competent Federal Judicial
System'' last month claimed responsibility for bombs that killed
U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance in Mountain Brook, Ala., and
attorney Robert Robinson in Savannah, Ga.
   The letter, which became the focus of the FBI's investigation
into the December mail bombings, expressed rage over Ms. Love's
slaying, saying it demonstrated the writer's contention that the
judicial system lets black men get away with crimes against white
women.
   Even before the mail bomb case became linked with Ms. Love's
slaying, the Atlanta woman's death had been one of the area's
highest-profile crimes.
   Police said Ms. Love, 27, was abducted by two men on an Atlanta
road the night of July 11, 1988. Her abandoned car was found three
days later in the city's fashionable Buckhead neighborhood.
   More than a year later, after a nationally publicized search in
which ``Have You Seen Julie Love?'' posters and billboards were
plastered across the city, her remains were found last August in a
trash-strewn, wooded area in Atlanta.
   Hours before Ms. Love's remains were found, police charged
Hammond and his 20-year-old cousin, William Porter, with her
slaying.
   In November, Porter pleaded guilty to felony murder, rape,
kidnapping and armed robbery. He has not been sentenced and is
expected to testify against Hammond.
   Police said Hammond shot Ms. Love in the head with a shotgun.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, home from a
three-nation trip, is proclaiming a bright future for Panama even
as some nations in the region refuse to recognize its
U.S.-installed government.
   Jamaica underscored its refusal Monday on the last stop of
Quayle's three-day trip.
   Quayle today briefed President Bush on his visits to Honduras,
Panama and Jamaica, and gave him ``a number of ideas on pushing
U.S. policy forward'' in the region, said the vice president's
press secretary, David Beckwith.
   Quayle said earlier he also gave Bush a ``very upbeat'' verbal
report on his trip during a telephone call en route home from
Jamaica Monday night.
   However, the vice president acknowledged that while the United
States is pressing for other Central American countries to
recognize the government of President Guillermo Endara, Jamaica and
Venezuela are insisting that elections be held there to legitimize
Endara first.
   ``As far as we're concerned he's legitimized now,'' Quayle told
reporters flying home with him from Kingston. The election last May
7, which observers said Endara won but which was invalidated by
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, ``was a free and fair election,'' he
added.
   However, Quayle today raised the possibility that balloting on
other offices and issues before Endara's term expires in 1994 could
satisfy the demands of Latin American leaders for an election.
   ``There are approximately six to nine seats in the National
Assembly that will not have a member because they couldn't certify
who won, so they have to have have elections there,'' he said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``Two, the constitution will have to be amended. ... primarily
because of the changes President Endara wants to do in the PDF
(Panamanian Defense Force), and therefore there is a possibility
that perhaps the amendments to the constitution could be offered as
a plebiscite. That would constitute an election,'' Quayle added.
   As he left Panama, Quayle praised Endara's plans to build a
national police force in place of an army, to develop a free-market
economy and to help crack down on laundering of drug money.
   Quayle predicted other countries in the region would recognize
Endara's government.
   ``I come away ... with a deep feeling of optimism about the
future of Panama. I'm optimistic that democracy will be developed
and will prevail,'' he said. ``I'm optimistic that other Latin
American countries will join in helping the Endara government.''
   Later Monday, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley said
Jamaica is not ready to recognize Endara's government.
   ``What we do about the Endara government will largely be
determined by the speed with which normality is restored, and
whether we feel some process is embarked upon that would ...
demonstrate legitimacy by some sort of expression of the people's
will in a vote,'' Manley said during a press conference with Quayle.
   Manley also said he still objects to the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion
of Panama, although he understood why Bush undertook it.
   Quayle ran into similar sentiments in his talks with Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez, whom he saw at the presidential
inauguration Saturday in Honduras, and spoke with again by
telephone from Air Force Two on Monday.
   Quayle was tasked by Bush with smoothing over the negative
feelings aroused throughout the region when Bush sent invasion
troops to Panama. Like Jamaica, most of the Latin nations felt the
invasion was a violation of Panama's sovereignty.
   Quayle acknowledged his visit had not reversed those sentiments.
But he stressed the significance of his talks was that the other
countries would look ahead, not backward.
   ``Yes, friends have a disagreement on the decision itself,'' he
said. ``But as friends we are committed to moving forward, and
we're going to move the process forward. That's the most important
thing.''
   Besides holding talks with Endara and Manley, Quayle met with
the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Belize, Costa Rica,
Honduras and Venezuela when all attended the Honduran inauguration.
   Concerns about potential cuts in U.S. economic assistance were a
common theme.
   Manley said his government believed it stood to lose $25 million
in economic support funds, but that Quayle indicated he was
``certainly sympathetic toward the problem.''
   Quayle promised the $25 million _ part of $124 million overall
in U.S. aid to Jamaica last year _ would not be completely slashed.
But he refused to say how much Jamaica might lose.
   He said the administration wants Congress to give Bush more
flexibility to free up the foreign aid money, which is now mostly
earmarked for a handful of countries with a comparatively small sum
left over to be divided among the remaining beneficiaries in the
world.

<HEAD>Communists Embrace Reunification; Honecker May go Free</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The embattled Communist leadership made a
desperate pitch to win voter support today by endorsing for the
first time the idea of eventual reunification with West Germany.
   Meanwhile, an East Berlin court rejected the Communist-dominated
government's request to keep its ousted leader, Erich Honecker,
behind bars until his treason trial in March.
   The chief prosecutor's office appealed Monday's decision by an
East Berlin court to the East German magistrate's office, but the
appeal was denied, said prosecutor's office spokesman Dieter Plath.
   Honecker, who was arrested and jailed earlier Monday, was
expected to be freed later today. The reasons for the East Berlin
court's refusal to issue the necessary warrants to keep Honecker in
jail were unclear.
   The Communists' fervor in prosecuting past leaders and embracing
popular causes comes amid a worsening economy, a continued flood of
emigration to the West and a surge in protests.
   The government has moved up elections from May to March 18 to
placate the nine opposition groups, whose frequently conflicting
demands and views encompass a broad political spectrum.
   It also will overhaul the current interim Cabinet to include
opposition members.
   The party, trying to win some support so it can gain a foothold
in a new elected government, for the first time today acknowledged
German unity as a long-term goal, but said it must be part of the
process of overcoming Europe's overall divisions.
   Andre Brie, a leading ideologist for the reformed party, said
German unity ``must not occur as fast as possible, but as slowly as
is required.''
   He said there must remain two German states for some time to
ensure European stability.
   Brie and Jochen Willerding, another leading party official,
unveiled a document in which the party, as part of its campaign for
elections, calls for a united, free and demilitarized Europe.
   Willerding also announced the party leadership would meet on
Sunday and likely change the party's name.
   Willerding said his party would rename itself simply Party of
Democratic Socialism, following the lead of the Polish and
Hungarian parties that are trying to remodel themselves into social
democratic organizations.
   Honecker, who ruled East Germany for 18 years before his ouster
after the pro-democracy revolt in October, is one of a dozen former
Communist Party Politburo members facing charges of corruption and
abuse of office.
   Honecker was arrested on Monday as he left an East Berlin
hospital where he had undergone surgery to remove a malignant
kidney tumor. He was taken to the capital's Rummelsburg prison.
   The disgraced former leader is to be tried in March on a charge
of high treason, prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph announced to
Parliament on Monday. Doctors who treated Honecker at Charite
hospital contended he was still too ill to be jailed.
   Honecker, who ruled East Germany for 18 years before his ouster
in last fall's peaceful pro-democracy revolt, is one of a dozen
former Communist Party Politburo members facing charges of
corruption and abuse of office.
   He is accused of leading the nation to the brink of economic
collapse through mismanagement and misuse of office for personal
enrichment. If convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in
prison.
   Prosecuting the figures of the past has taken a back seat to
dealing with the crises of the present, however.
   At Monday's a parliamentary session, embattled Communist Premier
Hans Modrow offered a grim account of the state of the nation.
   Economic failures and widespread unrest forced Modrow to move up
East Germany's first-ever free elections by two months to March 18
and to draw opposition forces into a coalition to rule in the
meantime.
   More than 100,000 people demonstrated in several East German
cities Monday night, many of them calling for defeat of the
Communists in the elections. Others renewed demands for German
reunification.
   Today, Modrow was in Moscow for a meeting with President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and reporters asked the Soviet leader about his
attitude toward reunification.
   Gorbachev said the subject has a place in discussions of
Europe's future, but: ``We have to act responsibly, and not decide
this important question on the streets.''
   Modrow told Parliament that strikes, protests, and the mass
flight of people to the West has endangered the existence of the
country.
   Under a coalition plan agreed to late Sunday, each of the nine
opposition groups that have been taking part in the weekly
negotiations will name a minister without portfolio to join
Modrow's 27-member Cabinet.
   The premier said the restructuring was needed ``to create a
government of national responsibility in this fateful situation.''
   A new Cabinet is to be announced Wednesday, and a special
session of Parliament will be called to approve the changes.

   Pope John Paul II capped his
visit to this West African nation today by telling 20,000 people at
an open-air Mass not to despair in their poverty.
   His face reddened from the sun and heat during six days of
touring sub-Saharan Africa, the Roman Catholic leader smiled as
dancers swayed on the altar. A female chorus sang hymns in the
Djula language to the beat of drums wrapped in animal skins.
   ``You are working for the development of your country,'' the
pope said from the altar set up in front of the town's train
station.
   ``I appeal with passion to the world to be in solidarity with
you who suffer the weight of poverty. I also urge you not to get
discouraged .... You are often poor in material goods but rich in
generosity,''
   Pope John Paul also urged the nation's Roman Catholics, who
comprise about 10 percent of the 8.5 million people, to collaborate
with Moslems, Protestants and animists in building up their country.
   ``I encourage you to pursue interreligious dialogue with clarity
and friendship,'' he said in a homily delivered in French, an
official language of the former French colony. He spoke held the

   Leaders of the two largest opposition
parties today accused Romania's new government of engineering
attacks by thousands of people on their headquarters.
   The broadcasting chief today resigned as chief spokesman of the
governing National Salvation Front following charges that it was
using the media to control the opposition.
   Also today, the front published the draft of a proposed law
guaranteeing free direct elections for Parliament and president, as
well as access to the media, an apparent concession to the
burgeoning opposition.
   Under the proposed election law, the two houses of Parliament
would have both elected members and appointed members, including
representatives of the military.
   The bill was debated in a weekend meeting of leaders from
Romania's more than 20 political parties, some new and some
revamped since the December revolution toppled the 24-year
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. Radio Bucharest said that
similar consultations will take place weekly.
   A series of demonstrations has taken place since the front,
which took over as an interim government following the popular
revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in December,
announced it would take part in elections in May.
   On Monday, about 15,000 supporters of the revolutionary
government rallied in the capital, breaking into the headquarters
of the Liberal Party and forcing the leader of the National
Peasants' Party to flee his party's offices in an armored personnel
carrier.
   Constantin Teodorescu, a Liberal leader, accused the front of
trying to destroy the opposition parties and planning to install a
new Communist dictatorship if it wins power in the elections.
   ``We already have a dictatorship of the Communist Party'' under
the front government, he said.
   In the aftermath of the attack on his own headquarters, Peasant
Party Vice President Virgil Lambru refused to blame the front.
   ``We can't say that because that would mean a war'' with the
front, he said.
   However, Peasant Party official Ion Ratiu laid the blame on the
government.
   Monday's well-organized demonstrations _ many participants were
workers who arrived in the city center in government-owned trucks
and buses _ showed that the people who took charge when Ceausescu
was overthrown last month are capable of mobilizing considerable
support.
   But government critics said the way workers turned out to back
the government smacked of the time-worn tactics of the East bloc's
deposed Communist regimes.
   One month after Romanians toppled Eastern Europe's most
hard-line Communist regime in a bloody revolution, political
stability seems far off.
   The resignation of Aurel Dragos Munteanu from the front came
four days after interim Vice President Dumitru Mazilu stepped down
and accused the front of using ``Stalinist methods.''
   Munteanu, head of the broadcast media that played a major role
in fueling the revolution, was one of the most visible figures of
the front, acting as spokesman at news conferences, although he was
not on the front's unelected 11-man governing council.
   Munteanu's resignation was announced late Monday night on state
TV. The only reason given was the need for objectivity in broadcast
reporting.
   There was no indication whether Munteanu's move was a
face-saving tactical maneuver by the front, or whether it would
lead to a more equitable distribution of broadcasting time among
political parties.
   The front has so far refused to relinquish its monopoly over
broadcasting, despite protests from opposition parties that they
have no way of getting their political message across to the
electorate.
   Testimony today continued against four of Ceausescu's top
associates during the third day of their trial before a military
tribunal on charges of complicity to commit genocide.
   The four _ former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, former
Central Committee Secretary Emil Bobu and former Politburo members
Manea Manescu and Ion Dinca _ have pleaded guilty to the charge,
which stems from the shooting of demonstrators in December that
sparked the uprising.
   The state Rompres news agency reported that after the military
prosecutor and the defense counsel requested new evidence, the
trial was adjourned until Thursday.
   The defendants face a maximum penalty of life in prison.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were convicted of the charge and
executed Dec. 25. The new government later abolished capital
punishment.

   Stride Rite Corp., the nation's No. 1
children's shoe company with such brands as Keds and Sperry
Top-Sider, said today it has rejected a $900 million takeover bid
from a group of investors.
   Chairman Arnold Hiatt said in a statement that the board
determined ``a successful, independent Stride Rite is in the best
long-term interests of Stride Rite's shareholders, employees,
customers and the communities we serve.''
   Stride Rite, which makes and sells shoes and has more than 180
stores and over 60 sections in department stores, received the
$32-per-share offer in December from a group led by Walsh,
Greenwood &amp; Co. of Greenwich, Conn.
   Stephen Walsh, managing general partner of the firm, said his
associates would review Stride Rite's response before announcing
their next move.
   Stride Rite announced today it had record sales and earnings for
the year that ended Dec. 1.
   Net income was $45.6 million, or $1.69 per share, compared with
earnings of $31.7 million, or $1.16 per share, the previous year.
Sales increased 20 percent from $378.7 million in 1988 to $454.3
million.
   Hiatt said Keds were a major factor in the company's results,
with sales 43 percent higher than they were in 1988.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s new jumbo
jet may need to diet.
   The MD-11 passenger jet began flight tests this month, six
months behind schedule. It is at least 4,000 pounds over its target
weight of 290,000 pounds, McDonnell Douglas Vice President Louis
Harrington said.
   The extra tonnage could cut the weight the $90 million plane is
capable of carrying or the distance it can fly without refueling.
   Harrington said the company is not in violation of any contract
specifications with customers for the MD-11's range or payload. But
the company will still try to drop some weight from the stretched
and updated version of its DC-10.
   ``Many aircraft have failed in history because they were
overweight,'' said Richard Kaplan, an aeronautics expert and
professor at the University of Southern California. ``Profit
margins for airlines are rather slim.''

<HEAD>Moynihan Pitches Payroll Tax Cut to Senior Citizens Group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan told the nation's
largest senior citizens group today his plan to cut Social Security
taxes poses no risk of benefit cuts and would help keep the system
financially sound.
   Reducing the payroll tax to stop the government from using
surplus Social Security revenues for other purposes would help
ensure public confidence in the system, Moynihan told the American
Association of Retired Persons.
   ``There would be no risk to benefits at any time,'' the New York
Democrat said. ``We are having the system perform just as it was
originally intended to do.''
   The Bush administration has said Moynihan's plan eventually
would lead to benefit cuts. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady today
called the proposal ``goofy'' and ``the height of folly.''
   Brady said Americans have faith in the Social Security system as
it currently works. ``People don't talk about it. They think the
money is there'' in the Social Security trust funds.
   ``He says because of the surplus, you can reduce the taxes. I
say that's goofy,'' Brady told a White House briefing.
   Moynihan has voiced concern that Social Security's growing trust
fund reserves are being used to mask the true size of the federal
deficit and to pay for other government programs. His solution is
to halt the buildup of the reserves and return Social Security to a
pay-as-you-go system in which taxes would be raised in the next
century to finance retirement benefits then.
   Moynihan said that if the government continues to use the trust
funds for other purposes, it could cause a loss of trust that could
be a ``seismic event.''
   ``This has the makings of a massive loss of trust,'' he said.
   The Bush administration, in its proposed fiscal 1991 budget,
unveiled a rival plan that would use Social Security's surpluses to
retire government debt once the federal budget is balanced.
Moynihan said that plan was unacceptable because it postpones
dealing with the problem.
   The New York Democrat addressed the AARP's national legislative
council, which has not yet taken a position on the Moynihan plan.

   Police unearthed 1,909 elephant
tusks in a coastal town after being tipped off by someone who
reported people ``burying things in gunny bags,'' a newspaper said
Tuesday.
   Elephant tusks are valued for their ivory, but in an effort to
preserve the dwindling elephant population, ivory trading has been
banned worldwide by the International Convention on Trade in
Endangered Species.
   Tanzania and other African countries have cracked down hard on
poaching.
   The Daily News said the tusks weighed a total of eight tons and
were found buried on a small island off the Indian Ocean port of
Tanga sometime between Jan. 22 and Jan. 26.
   Elias Lundamila, the Tanga regional police commander, was quoted
as saying the ivory was valued at $822,785. He said no arrests had
been made.

   The government has built more than
600 miles of electrically charged fences to keep wild elephants
from destroying crops, a newspaper said Tuesday.
   The fences are not designed to killed the animals but only to
scare them away from the plantations, said Mohamed Khan Momin Khan,
director-general of the National Parks Department.
   The problem is a result of Malaysia's expanding crops, which
have forced the country's 1,000 or so wild elephants off the jungle
lands they once roamed. As the land is cleared for oil palm, rubber
and other crops, the elephants return in search of food and eat the
crops, Mohamed told the New Straits Times.
   Since 1969, elephants have caused more than $111 million damage
to crops, he said.
   Mohamed said his department has begun rounding up the elephants
and trucking them to areas far from the plantations, but up to 500
of the animals have yet to be caught.
   Authorities built more than 600 miles of fences that carry
enough of an electrical shock to drive the animals away but not
kill them, he added.
   Still, when they can find no other food, the elephants sometimes
crash through the fences to get at crops, he said.
   Department rangers then rush to areas where crops are being
attacked, track down the elephants, shoot them with tranquilizer
guns and chain them to trees.
   Flanked by two tame elephants, the wild elephants then are
coaxed onto trucks and moved to new locations.

   A bomb believed set by Basque terrorists
killed a police officer Tuesday near this northern provincial
capital, authorities said.
   The afternoon explosion instantly killed the officer, Ignacio
Perez Alvarez, and damaged cars and shattered windows near his home
in the town of Galdacano, six miles east of Bilbao, a municipal
police officer said.
   Investigators were unsure whether the bomb was planted in his
car or on a bicycle parked nearby, said the officer, who was not
identified in keeping with custom. It blew up as the victim got
into his car.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but
it bore the hallmarks of the separatist group ETA, which claimed
responsibility last year for attacks that killed 17 people.
   ETA, which stands for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has killed more than 600 people in its 21-year armed
campaign to secure independence for the northern, three-province
Basque region.
   Most of the victims have been civil guards, police and military
officers.

   An aborigine on Tuesday asked Ireland to return

Australia for burial.
   Aborigine Rikki Shields said he has written to Ireland's
President Patrick Hillery to help in the campaign to move the head
from the Dublin headquarters of the Royal College of Surgeons in
Ireland to Australia.
   The head is said to be that of Pemulwoy, who once led an
aborigine guerrilla campaign against the British in Australia. He
was captured and killed in 1862.
   ``His head was sent to London, but his memory lives in the minds
of the aboriginal people,'' said Shields, who is visiting Ireland.
   A spokesman for the Royal College of Surgeons said the head,
which is not on public display because of the controversy, was left
to them in a bequest a century ago and they had to honor it.
   ``I challenge the college's right to the head,'' Shields said.
``I also want the return of other aboriginal objects which might be
in Ireland.
   ``The British stole them, but the Irish are perpetuating the
crime,'' Shields said.

   The government lifted curfew in this
violence-torn Kashmir city for eight hours Tuesday, giving
residents their longest taste of freedom in 10 days.
   At least one incident of violence was reported. Witnesses said
Moslem militants agitating for independence shot another Moslem,
claiming he was helping the Indian government in its crackdown on
the secessionist movement.
   The 23-year-old man, identified only as Kauser, was taken to a
hospital, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
His condition was not known.
   Other witnesses said about 5,000 people demonstrated during the
curfew relaxation to protest the alleged entry by paramilitary
policemen into a mosque. There was no violence, said the witnesses
who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Meanwhile, municipal workers removed hundreds of garbage cans
piled on streets and grocers sold fresh fruit for the first time
since the curfew was imposed in Srinagar on Jan. 20 after clashes
between security forces and Moslem separatists.
   The Moslem militants demand either independence for Kashmir or
unity with Moslem Pakistan. Kashmir is a part of the state of
Jammu-Kashmir, the only Indian state with a majority Moslem
population. Most Indians are Hindus.
   Srinagar, the state's summer capital and once a popular holiday
retreat, is the flashpoint of the Kashmiri movement.
   At least 72 people, mostly Moslem males, have been killed in
Kashmir since Jan. 20. The state government said Monday there had
been no violence for the previous four days.
   The curfew was lifted for seven hours Monday, and that was
extended to eight hours Tuesday.
   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir since they
were partitioned in 1947 upon gaining independence from Britain.
The state is divided into Pakistani and Indian sectors by a
U.N.-monitored line of control.
   India accuses neighboring Pakistan of aiding the Kashmiri
militants, a charge that has been routinely denied. But Paskistan
says it supports the separatism, describing it as a movement for
self-determination.
   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan called Tuesday
for India to allow the Kashmir dispute to be decided in a popular
vote.
   ``It is an outstanding issue which is to be resolved through a
plebiscite under the United Nations supervision,'' he said in a
nationally televised speech.
   ``The Indian government is trying to suppress the freedom
movement in Kashmir through atrocities, resulting in deaths of
hundreds of Kashmiris and injuries to many more,'' Yaqub Khan said.
   The Indian crackdown began after Moslem militants stepped up
attacks on the government, burning state-owned buildings,
assassinating at least three intelligence agents and kidnapping the
daughter of a Cabinet minister in Srinagar in December.
   She was released after the government freed five jailed members
of the pro-independence Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front.

   Al Denoncour survived three wars, but
the federal bureaucracy has killed him off with paperwork.
   Mary Denoncour got the notice in the mail Saturday.
   ``My wife opened the letter and said `What is this? What is
this?' I said, `What is it?' She said, `Read it. They've got you
dead.'''
   The letter, from the Treasury Department, said Mrs. Denoncour
owed the government $508, the amount of her husband's January
Social Security check. It said the check was mailed before
Denoncour died on Dec. 31.
   ``I survived World War II, Korea and two tours in Vietnam,''
Denoncour said. ``Then I come out here and this happens.''
   Denoncour, 69, retired from the Army in 1969 and has taught
energy conservation at Fayetteville Technical Community College for
about 15 years.
   ``I called my supervisor and told him I couldn't teach a class
Monday. He asked why. I said, `Well, I'm deceased.' He just
laughed,'' he said.
   He made sure his military retirement benefits weren't affected,
then traced the mistake to the Social Security Administration.
   ``They're the ones that pulled the boo-boo,'' he said.
   The mistake is unusual, an official said.
   ``It happens rarely. We pay 38 million people every month and
about 99 percent are paid correctly and on time,'' said Darryl
Mull, public affairs officer for the Social Security
Administration's office in Atlanta.
   ``He'll get paid next month,'' Mull said. ``It might not be
right on time, but he'll be paid sometime shortly after that.''
   ``We'll take every action needed to get him paid timely and get
him back in current benefit status,'' he added.
   Denoncour is not so confident.
   ``It's going to be one heck of a mess,'' he said. ``They're
already giving my wife her (widow's) benefits.''
   ``By the time they get through messing with it, it will take
years and years,'' he said. ``They'll bug me about it. Social
Security is like that.''
   ``They want me to prove I'm alive,'' he said. He's already
gotten the school to prepare a notarized letter attesting to that
fact.
   ``When this is all over, I'll probably have one celebration. Get
my friends together and just say, `Look here, I'm still kicking,'
'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A report to Congress says poor, uneducated and
isolated citizens are likely to suffer from an ``information gap''
in the next century unless the government sets policies to deal
with advances in communications.
   The Office of Technology Assessment said that, given the
direction of technological change and current policy uncertainties,
the gap is likely to increase between those who can afford and make
effective use of communications services and those who cannot.
   ``Government indecision'' in dealing with the rapidly developing
technologies in computers, telephones and video will affect not
only the realm of communication, but other key areas such as
business as well, OTA said in a report, ``Critical Connections:
Communications for the Future.''
   The study, released Tuesday, was requested by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Congress is considering bills that would boost U.S.
competitiveness in advanced technologies, including communications,
by encouraging manufacturing partnerships.
   It also is expected to consider, later this year, whether to
allow the regional Bell telephone companies into the information
services businesses from which they were barred following the 1984
breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
   The Bush administration favors easing antitrust laws to pave the
way for joint production arrangements, but it has been criticized
for foot-dragging in detailing an overall technology policy and for
apparently considering cuts in federal support for some
high-technology research projects.
   OTA, a non-partisan, analytical arm of Congress, identified a
number of factors that may deprive the poor, the undereducated and
the geographically and technologically isolated portions of the
public and small and medium-sized businesses.
   They included:
   _Shifting government subsidies.
   _Increased costs for the use of technology.
   _Growth in the economic power and concentration of many media.
   _Disagreement among policy-makers about what should constitute
universal service.
   OTA said the concept of providing universal telephone service on
a common, shared network is breaking down. It raised the
possibility that a two-tiered telecommunications system _ one
public, the other private _ may develop.
   ``If businesses view their needs as unique and decide to develop
their own private networks, as some are doing now, there may be
insufficient revenues available to support an advanced public
network to serve all individuals,'' OTA said.
   OTA listed different strategies Congress could adopt to improve
access to communications services:
   _Influence the means by which communication services are
financed.
   _Structure the prices at which communication services are
offered.
   _Regulate or redefine the rights of media owners.

   Eight men have been arrested in an
undercover sting operation and charged with dealing in stolen
jeans, which agents said were destined for European markets at
inflated prices.
   The buyers expected to receive 200,000 pairs of stolen Levi 501
jeans initially, with an additional 200,000 pairs monthly, said
agents of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
   ``Levi 501 jeans are a hot item in the United States and worth
even more in Europe,'' said agent Mike Brick.
   Investigators said the pants that sell here for $30-$35 bring
$55 or more in Italy.
   Brick said Monday that the agents conducted a sting operation
after a Kissimmee clothing broker asked an undercover agent where
he could get large quantities of the jeans for resale overseas.
   Agents made it clear to the buyers that the jeans were stolen
from a Levi company distribution center, but the buyers were only
concerned that they not get counterfeits, he said.
   The defendants could face 5- to 30-year prison terms, officials
said.

   A new costume for the Pittsburgh Pirates'
parrot mascot, worth about $8,200, has been stolen from a car
parked downtown, police said.
   Mike Recktenwald, 26, of Brentwood, one of two men who play the
role of the baseball team's 7-foot-tall mascot, had parked the car
near Robert Morris College while he attended classes Monday.
   Police said a rear window was pried open. A large gym bag
containing the parrot's body was taken along with a bag containing
the mascot's trademark head with its huge beak and buccaneer hat.
   Some of Recktenwald's clothing and accessories also were taken.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``The costume was brand new.
I only had it a week.''
   Pirates spokesman Rick Cerrone said the 30-pound costume was one
of two bought for the upcoming baseball season.
   ``It's not like you could put it on and just go strolling around
somewhere,'' Cerrone said. ``I don't know what anybody would do
with it.''

<TEXT>
   Biologists believe Florida's only
endangered fish species is being squeezed out of its habitat by
another species descended from discarded bait fish.
   Brown darters apparently were introduced into Florida Panhandle
streams years ago when fishermen cleaned out their bait buckets.
   The newcomers are now out-competing native Okaloosa darters for
food and habitat, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is
conducting a study to find out why.
   Only 1,500 to 10,000 of the two-inch long Okaloosa darters are
believed to be left in streams leading into Rocky and Boggy bayous,
the only places in the world where they are found.
   Both fish eat worms and insects.
   The Okaloosa darter is related to the Tennesse snail darter,
another endangered species that was the center of a controversy in
1978, delaying completion of a huge dam because of fears it would
wipe out the last of the tiny fish.
   The Okaloosa darter doesn't face such a threat. Most of its
habitat is on Eglin Air Force Base's military reservation. Weapons
testing on the reservation has not harmed the darter, said
biologist Noel Burkhead and Jim Williams, who is heading the study.
Both work out of the National Fisheries Research Center in
Gainesville.

   White House budget director Richard G. Darman
clashed with congressional Democrats today over whether President
Bush's $1.23 trillion 1991 budget is based on realistic economic
forecasts.
   Darman responded to criticism from Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee, who noted that Office of
Management and Budget projections on economic growth, inflation and
unemployment are considerably more optimistic than those of private
forecasters.
   ``You are not dealing with people who are totally out of
bounds'' in trying to project what direction the economy will take
over the next several months, Darman told the House Budget
Committee. He said OMB, which he heads, has been remarkably close
to accurate in forecasts made last July.
   Panetta said the administration's economic assumptions and use
of such tactics as shifting payments from one year to another to
make the deficit look smaller call into question whether the
deficit is being taken seriously.
   ``Of course the president is serious. I am serious,'' Darman
shot back. ``I wish you had taken that on some faith.''
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the
committee, defended Bush's budget, which was made public Monday, as
``a pretty good beginning.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley Jr. told reporters the
administration budget plan ``does not take major directions'' but
added, ``I believe we can and should reach a budget compromise.''
   Bush said his fiscal blueprint keeps ``an eye toward future
growth,'' halving the federal deficit to $63.1 billion while
building up government science, space, anti-drug and environment
efforts.
   But majority Democrats on Capitol Hill accused the president of
being too kind to the Pentagon despite diminishing tensions with
the Soviet Union, too stingy with domestic spending and overly
dependent on phantom savings and unrealistic economic projections.
   ``At a time when we need bold leadership, what we have is
another slide-by budget,'' Panetta said.
   While praising the president's plan, many Republicans conceded
fiscal 1991 _ which begins Oct. 1 _ poses so many difficult
problems that budget work is likely to be time-consuming and thorny.
   ``I believe there is a real chance here of stalemate,'' lamented
Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, the Senate budget panel's ranking
Republican.
   Bush proposed paring $36.5 billion from next year's projected
budget gap, finding nearly half the savings by collecting $15.7
billion in additional tax revenues. Bush revived his push to cut
the capital gains tax rate _ which the Senate denied him last year
_ arguing it would raise $4.9 billion next year by encouraging
property sales.
   The new levies are partially offset by $1.8 billion in specific
tax breaks, including a $1,000 credit to poor families for each
child under 4 years old.
   Other savings would come from slashing domestic programs by more
than $14 billion below the rate they would otherwise grow _
including $5.5 billion from Medicare _ restraining growth in the
military budget, collecting new and higher user fees and leasing
federal property.
   ``We have taken pain to exclude gimmicks,'' Darman told
reporters.
   But Democrats pointed to unspecified ``management'' savings of
$5 billion in the Pentagon and $2.5 billion at the Internal Revenue
Service, among other items.
   They also grumbled that it assumed a brighter economy this year
than many congressional and private analysts expect, a factor that
lets the government project higher revenue collections. Using the
economic forecasts Democrats consider accurate, Bush's budget would
produce a $100 billion shortfall, they said.
   ``In other words, there's no change in fiscal direction in this
budget,'' griped Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser,
D-Tenn.
   Bush presented his spending plan as one responsive to ``the
dramatic changes in the world political situation.''
   He limited Pentagon spending to $292.1 billion _ higher than
this year's $286.8 billion, but 2 percent less than the total
needed to stay even with inflation. Bush sought increases for
expensive weapons systems such as $900 million more for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, but a cutback of 38,000 troops and
the shutdown of dozens of military bases.
   Foley said the president's defense budget would be reduced, but
would not specify an amount. But he also predicted Congress ``will
not accept'' the administration's proposed freeze on cost-of-living
increases for military and civilian retirees.
   Bush also hiked spending for foreign aid and other international
expenditures to $18.2 billion, a 12 percent boost that included
$300 million for Eastern Europe.
   But Democrats complained Bush should have carved more out of the
military.
   ``You'd think Joe Stalin had come back and entrenched himself in
the Kremlin,'' Sasser said.
   Bush's proposals to raise domestic spending read like a menu of
his past campaign promises. He sought a $1.2 billion hike _ to $7.6
billion _ in environmental programs, including an effort to plant 1
billion trees annually.
   Federal anti-drug efforts would increase from $6.9 billion to
$9.7 billion, the Head Start pre-school program for poor children
would get a $500 million infusion to $1.9 billion, and NASA's
budget would soar from $12 billion to $14.1 billion.
   Democratic staffers on the Senate Budget Committee said they
found 24 programs Bush was proposing to eliminate, including the
Economic Development Administration, federal subsidies for the
Amtrak passenger railroad, and energy conservation grants to state
and local governments.
   Bush also proposed reducing spending for mass transit aid to
communities, several student loan programs and heating bill
assistance for the poor.
   The president also proposed a plan to gradually shift the
massive Social Security surpluses out of the deficit calculations.
Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., has gained center stage by proposing
to cut the retirement system's payroll tax.

<HEAD>Bingaman Wants to Assess Student Progress, Longer School Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Longer school days and thorough assessment of
students at each grade level could improve education in the United
States, a New Mexico senator said Tuesday.
   Democrat Jeff Bingaman introduced bills to authorize a study on
the feasibility of lengthening the school day and academic year and
to create a council to keep tabs on the academic achievements of
students and school quality.
   ``It is time Congress seriously considers how as a nation we
will be prepared to face and succeed in the next century,'' Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said at a news conference
with Bingaman.
   ``We have begun an era of technological sophistication that will
require a well-educated workforce.''
   Mitchell is co-sponsoring the two bills with Bingaman and Sens.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Tom Harkin, R-Iowa.
   Bingaman, chairman of the Governmental Affairs subcommittee on
government information and regulation, said there was a good chance
the bills would get to the Senate floor this session. However, he
was uncertain they would reach the House.
   The 200-day School Year Study Act would create a commission to
review school-day policies among states, as well as the effect a
longer school year would have on teacher salaries and on the
communities paying those salaries.
   ``I have long believed that the school year should be
extended,'' Mitchell said.
   American students, he said, attend school about 180 days per
year, while Europeans typically attend 220 days, the Japanese 240
days and South Koreans 250 days per year.
   The school-year commission also would design a plan to assist
states and local school districts in meeting the additional costs
associated with a longer school year.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos does not support longer school
days, Bingaman said. Polls also indicate that the general public
and students oppose longer school days, he said.
   ``That may not determine whether we ought to do it or not,''
Bingaman said, adding that the studies may provide ``persuasive
evidence.''
   The National Report Card Act of 1990 would establish a council
of experts to study, make recommendations and periodically report
on the status of the nation's educational achievement from
preschool through higher education.
   ``A realistic assessment of educational quality and the
establishment of national education goals is heavily dependent on
the quality and availability of U.S. educational statistics and
information,'' Bingaman said.

<HEAD>Arab League Envoy Urges U.S. Pressure On Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arab League's representative on Tuesday
urged the Bush administration to reassess and toughen its policy
against settlement of Soviet Jews in Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``The Soviet Jewish immigration issue, in bolstering Israel's
intransigence and whetting its appetite for expansion, must lead to
a genuine reassessment of U.S. policy...,'' Clovis Maksoud told a
news conference.
   Israeli expectations of thousands of Soviet immigrants a month
represent ``an explosive situation'' and a new threat to Middle
East peace prospects, he said.
   ``The Palestinian people ... cannot sit idly by and watch Soviet
Jewish immigrants settling in Israel as full-fledged citizens when
Palestinian refugees are systematically denied their inalienable
right of return or their right to be compensated,'' Maksoud said.
   The United States and the Soviet Union should ``realize the
potential of this demographic explosion'' and convene a
long-discussed international conference on the Middle East, he
said. The United States has traditionally opposed the Soviet-backed
proposal for an international conference, focusing its efforts on
arranging direct Israeli-Arab talks.
   Maksoud said State Department statements about the settlement
issue do not go far enough and the United States should return to
its policy during the Carter administration of considering
settlements in the occupied territories illegal.
   The Reagan administration changed this to declaring settlement
in the occupied territories as an ``obstacle to peace.''
   The State Department said Monday that U.S. aid is limited to use
inside Israel and is forbidden for use in settling immigrants in
the occupied territories.
   Maksoud said the Arab countries question whether the aid is
adequately monitored to prevent its use in the territories, and
said stronger verification is needed to keep Israel from ``cheating
on utilization of aid.''

   A federal judge today ordered former President
Reagan to turn over excerpts of his diaries to former national
security adviser John M. Poindexter for use in his Iran-Contra case.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene directed Reagan to produce
entries from the ex-president's diaries for 29 different dates in
1985 and 1986.
   In addition, Poindexter is entitled to receive other diary
excerpts, said the judge. He did not detail how many or what dates.
   Reagan was ordered to produce a diary entry relating to a
``successful'' trip Poindexter took in December 1985 to Central
America.
   ``The entry includes a somewhat ambiguous comment arguably
indicating that the former president knew'' of Poindexter's
``activities on behalf of the Contras,'' Greene said.
   Reagan was ordered to give Poindexter the diary entries by next
Monday.
   Theodore Olson, one of Reagan's lawyers, wasn't immediately
available for comment, his office said.
   Greene gave the former president nearly a week to produce the
material in case he decides to assert the doctrine of executive
privilege in an attempt to avoid surrendering the diaries.
   The judge said Poindexter is entitled to diary entries in which
Reagan describes an effort to persuade the government of Honduras
to release a seized arms shipment that had been destined for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Greene also said Poindexter must receive diary entries focusing
on U.S. military-type assistance to an unidentified Central
American country in support of the Contras.
   This occurred during a congressional ban on U.S. military aid
for the rebels fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua.
   Poindexter is entitled to the entries because ``they may show
what types of aid President Reagan thought could legally be
provided for the military or paramilitary operations of the
Contras,'' Greene said.
   Poindexter is charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of counts of making false statements in
connection with Oliver North's assistance to the Contras and the
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   He is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20.
   Poindexter also is entitled to Reagan's diary entries concerning
meetings with Poindexter and others in December 1985 ``to discuss
the sales of arms to Iran,'' said the court ruling.
   One diary entry ``addresses briefly the issue of the proceeds
from these sales'' of arms to Iran, it said.
   None of the diary entries ``sheds any light on the question of
what President Reagan may have know about the diversion'' of
proceeds to the Contra rebels from the administration's secret sale
of arms to Iran.
   Reagan has denied knowing about the diversion and Poindexter
testified to Congress that he didn't tell the president.
   Greene said Poindexter isn't entitled to a large number of diary
entries that deal with the Iran-Contra affair but aren't relevant
to the criminal case against the former national security adviser.
   Poindexter maintains that Reagan knew of and approved activities
undertaken in the Iran and Contra initiatives and that therefore he
had no reason to conceal these activities from Congress, as charged
in the indictment against him.
   Poindexter has said that Reagan took notes at meetings focusing
on congressional inquiries into whether North, then a National
Security Council aide, was raising money and providing military
advice to the Contras.
   The responses sent by Poindexter embraced false denials about
North's involvement that had been sent to Congress in 1985 by
Robert McFarlane, Poindexter's predecessor as national security
adviser.
   ``We believe the president's notes will show his discussions
with Admiral Poindexter, first about the letters that were sent by
Congress and the appropriateness of any response,'' one of
Poindexter's lawyers said in court last Sept. 6.
   In addition, Poindexter has told the judge that his meetings
with Reagan also dealt with the accuracy of a chronology prepared
by North on a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   Four of the criminal charges against Poindexter deal with this
false chronology and Poindexter's alleged statements to Congress
that he didn't know until 1986 that the November 1985 shipment
contained Hawk missiles.

   About 90 prospective jurors were
summoned today for the trial of the fired Exxon skipper charged in
the nation's worst oil spill.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone read the poetential jurors
the charges, then divided them into groups of 30, each to be
questioned over three days.
   Former captain Joseph Hazelwood watched quietly in the courtroom
where reporters outnumbered spectators until the jury pool filed
in. The potential jurors had filled out questionnaires in advance
for the lawyers to study.
   Hazelwood's trial got under way Monday with Johnstone rejecting
yet another effort to have charges against the veteran mariner
dismissed.
   But the judge did not rule on whether to bar key evidence _
results of a sobriety test that Hazelwood had failed after the
Exxon Valdez spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil.
   In addition to the 12 jurors, Johnstone said three or four
alternates probably will be selected.
   Hazelwood faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge
of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated. The maximum
penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years, three months
in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Defense lawyer Dick Madson had told Johnstone the charges should
be dismissed because federal law pre-empts state law in the case.
   ``I feel that this show should not go on, at least not here.''
Madson said. ``Federal laws and regulations have covered this
(commercial shipping) field for 200 years, and there's a good
reason for it,'' Madson said. He said federal law prevails to
guarantee consistent rules from port to port, regardless of the
state involved.
   But Johnstone denied Madson's motion, saying it lacked substance.
   Earlier defense efforts to get the indictment dismissed failed
in various courts.
   Still pending is a defense motion to prohibit as evidence the
results of a blood-alcohol test that Hazelwood failed about 10
hours after his ship struck a reef in Prince William Sound on March
24.
   The spill, which blackened shores and killed wildlife, triggered
what Exxon calculated was a $2 billion cleanup. Some state
officials and others say the work is not over and should continue
this spring and summer.
   Hazelwood is expected to be present throughout the trial, which
is to last six weeks or more.
   Johnstone told lawyers on both sides he expects jury selection
to take less than the two weeks that lawyers predicted. The judge
warned he does not want the process to be drawn out with extensive
questions about the candidates' backgrounds.
   The three-page questionnaire filled out by prospective jurors
includes questions about experience with vessels, work in the oil
and fishing industries, familiarity with the oil spill and personal
economic loss or gain tied to the spill.
   Hazelwood originally was scheduled for an October trial in
Valdez, the port from which the tanker set out a few hours before
the crash. The trial for the Huntington, N.Y., seaman was moved to
Anchorage to increase the chance of a fair proceeding and to take
advantage of a larger jury pool and court room.

<HEAD>Army Short of Decorations for Panama Veterans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army has a new Panama emergency: a
shortage of decorations for infantrymen who saw combat in the Dec.
20 invasion.
   The deficit of the Combat Infantryman's Badges came as five
Democratic senators Tuesday urged the Army to give the awards to
women who were in combat in Panama.
   ``We understand the Army is firm in its objection to women in
combat,'' said a letter initiated by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.
   ``But, women were in combat in Panama, and deserve full
recognition of their accomplishments and courage in behalf of
American people. They should be given the Combat Infantryman's
Badge,'' the senators said in a letter to Army Secretary Michael
T.W. Stone
   Others senators signing the letter were Democrats Kent Conrad
and Quentin Burdick of North Dakota; Thomas Daschle of South
Dakota; and Paul Simon of Illinois.
   The Army says the women who went to Panama did not serve in
infantry units, but were assigned to non-combatant support units.
Only infantry officers and enlisted soldiers who ``satisfactorily
perform the infantry operations in active ground combat'' are
eligible for the badges, Army regulations say.
   Meanwhile, the Army had made an ``expedited buy'' of 10,000
decorations from Lordship Industries in Hauppauge, N.Y., said Frank
Johnson, a spokesman of the Defense Personnel Support System in
Philadelphia.
   The 3-inch badges cost 90 cents each and are emblazoned with a
wreath and a rifle. Some 2,500 badges will be shipped to Ford Ord,
Calif., by March 3 to meet a shortage there.
   The shortage cropped up because the Army didn't anticipate the
Panama invasion in which 9,000 of the roughly 26,000 troops
involved in the operation were infantrymen.
   ``When we looked ahead, we didn't anticipate needing the ones
for Panama,'' said Shari Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the Army
Personnel Command.
   ``It's a fairly routine thing,'' Lawrence said of the badge.
``You don't have to have any valorous situation.''
   Maj. L.D. Walker at Fort Ord said the badges were highly sought
after by infantrymen, who haven't had many combat situations in
recent years to qualify.
   ``They don't have very much opportunity _ opportunity is maybe
the wrong word _ to get those,'' he said.

   Ostwald, 82, last week celebrated the birth of her 100th

   Ostwald never has had a driver's license, so when she and her

   Two hundred fifty dollars buys a lot of
bacon, but a group of youngsters got more than 200 pounds of pork
for their money.
   The Junior Humane Society at Brownsville Middle School submitted
the winning bid at a sheriff's auction Monday, saving a pregnant
sow from the butcher's knife.
   ``She's going to have babies and we didn't want her or her
babies to get slaughtered,'' said Frankie Van Horn, a teacher and
the Junior Humane Society sponsor.
   Sidney Gottlieb, a circulation worker for the Pensacola News
Journal, donated $200 to help meet the auction price.
   The students plan to keep the pig as a pet and are looking for
homes for her piglets.
   The animal, found wandering on Christmas Eve, was auctioned
after no one came forward to pay a $115 impoundment bill and other
costs of caring for it.
   The students plan to call the pig Fern, for the little girl who
saved Wilbur the pig in ``Charlotte's Web.''

   Cupid need not point his love-drenched quills in
this city. At least that's what a new sign implies.
   The sign, a take-off on the international symbol prohibiting
something, shows a bride and groom inside a circle with a slash
through it. But an official insisted Tuesday the city is not
anti-love.
   ``It's a funky sign and we made it in a fun way,'' said
Department of Ports and Trades spokesman Frances Resheske.
   The sign recently went up on a public pier in the borough of
Queens after residents complained to their community board that the
pier was frequently being closed for private weddings.
   ``We didn't mean to imply that weddings are prohibited,''
Resheske said, ``just that people are not allowed to close off the
pier to the public.''
   She said many couples holding receptions at an adjacent
restaurant were led to believe they could hold private ceremonies
on the pier, with a view of the Manhattan skyline.
   The restaurant has a lease allowing it to operate on city
property but the rights do not extend to the pier, Resheske said.
   The sign may be fun, but the city isn't joking, Resheske said.
Lovebirds who violate it could be fined up to $5,000.

<HEAD>Experts Disagree on Adjusting the Census Count</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Politicians and statisticians disagreed
Tuesday on whether this year's census can be made more accurate by
adjusting the final numbers.
   ``The census is a political act and there are winners and
losers. The losers say `count differently,' and the winners say
`leave it alone,''' observed Rep. William M. Thomas, R-Calif.
   ``We count with about 98 percent accuracy, but not perfection,''
added Thomas at a House census and population subcommittee hearing
on proposed guidelines for deciding whether to adjust the count
following the census this March and April.
   The 1980 national head count missed about 3.2 million people,
often poor and minorities, the Census Bureau has calculated.
Efforts to reduce that undercount are underway, but many people are
still expected to be missed this year.
   Because census figures are used to apportion seats in Congress
and state legislatures, the anticipated undercount led to a lawsuit
filed by New York and other cities fearing loss of representation.
   The lawsuit was settled by an agreement that the Census Bureau
would develop guidelines for deciding if the final counts could be
improved by some form of statistical adjustment.
   A set of proposed guidelines was published in December and
promptly drew fire from backers of making the adjustment, who say
the guidelines are too stringent.
   In general the guidelines cite the basic census as a standard of
accuracy and suggest changing the count only if it can be shown
that the modifications would be even more accurate, not just
nationally but on local levels also. In addition the guidelines
would discourage adjustment if the process would result in
confusion or disruption of the political process of undermine
public confidence in the census numbers.
   Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, was concerned that the guidelines
``appear to create a strong presumption against adjustment. ...''
   ``These guidelines ... cast grave doubts on the sincerity of the
Department of Commerce,'' Barbara A. Bailer, executive director of
the American Statistical Association and a former Census Bureau
official, said in her prepared testimony.
   And Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, said that in his opinion the
guidelines ``almost insure no adjustment.''
   The proposed guidelines ``so stack the deck against the
possibility of correction that their adoption will be tantamount to
a decision not to correct the differential undercount,'' concluded
New York Attorney General Robert Abrams in his prepared testimony.
   Michael R. Darby, Commerce under secretary for economic affairs,
responded that the department hopes to take such an accurate census
that adjustment won't be needed; but if it is, the guidelines are
still under development and can be modified.
   ``If the Census Bureau is going to part from its tradition of
publishing figures based only on people actually counted, it must
have firm and noncontroversial ground to stand on,'' V. Lance
Tarrance, co-chairman of the Census advisory panel on adjustment,
said in his testomony.
   ``Arguments against adjustment ... seem to me stronger than the
arguments for,'' added William Kruskal, professor emeritus of
statistics at the University of Chicago.
   ``Proponents of adjustment believe that the data, when
available, will show overwhelmingly that the counts can be improved
by statistical adjustment. Skeptics like myself suspect that they
will not,'' concluded Kenneth Wachter of the University of
California at Berkeley.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Petar Mladenov
fiercely attacked the ousted leadership Tuesday but offered few
ideas for change as he tried to please reformers and conservatives
and avoid a party split.
   As the party began a three-day congress, Mladenov proposed
splitting the post of party chief and state president, which he
assumed when Todor Zhivkov was removed from 35 years in power Nov.
10.
   ``It's my suggestion that the comrades adopt a decision that the
same person should not be leading the party and the state at the
same time,'' Mladenov told the 2,752 delegates.
   In his two-hour opening speech, Mladenov tried to please
reformers by talking in general terms of change, while pandering to
conservatives by giving little ground to the opposition.
   But he had few fresh ideas on how to keep the party together and
gave only half-hearted support to creation of a market economy. He
focused mainly on criticism of Zhivkov.
   Debate during the afternoon showed divisions emerging between
the conservative majority and the various reform factions who favor
quicker moves toward democracy.
   When one hard-line delegate insisted, ``I am against private
ownership ... and do not accept the exploitation of man by man,''
another called for removing party structures that ``generate
totalitarian ways and rule'' and suggested changing the party's
name.
   The congress was originally not scheduled until 1991, but it was
rescheduled after Bulgaria was caught up in the pro-democracy
movement sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Mladenov was at his most forthright in criticizing the
35-year-rule of Zhivkov, who on Monday was said to have been moved
from house arrest in a villa to prison pending trial on charges of
misappropriation of state property, inciting ethnic hostility and
grave abuse of power.
   ``Bearer of a painful suspiciousness and selfishness, of a manic
ambition to be a theoretician in the complete absence of any kind
of intellectual abilities, he was unscrupulous and insidious,''
Mladenov said of Zhivkov.
   He accused the ousted leader of staging fake trials in attempts
to fight his opponents with ``the most brutal terrorist means,''
but he added, ``Those designs ultimately failed.''
   There has been speculation that Mladenov, who served as
Zhivkov's foreign minister for 17 years and is rumored to suffer
from a heart condition, might retain the presidency and allow
someone else to take over the party.
   But it was unclear Tuesday whether another holdover from the
Zhivkov era, reformer Andrei Lukanov, could win the post, or
whether Bulgaria's Communists will follow other East European
parties and bring new blood into the leadership in an attempt to
boost the party's standing.
   Opposition leaders and some reform Communists doubt the current
ruling group _ Mladenov, Lukanov and Politburo member Alexander
Lilov _ are sincere about genuine change.
   One of the few rounds of applause for Mladenov came when he
rejected opposition calls to postpone the nation's first free
parliamentary elections in more than 40 years. Mladenov insisted
they be held ``not later than May.''
   The opposition had sought a postponement until November to give
it time to organize against the still powerful Communists.
   Mladenov appeared to try to exploit divisions within the still
weak opposition by reiterating calls for a new ``government of
national concord'' before the elections.
   Some opposition leaders have rejected this idea outright, saying
they do not want to be responsible for the chaos caused by four
decades of Communist rule. Others have suggested they might
participate in such an interim Cabinet.
   Both East Germany and Czechoslovakia, whose Communist parties
have collapsed far faster than Bulgaria's, are now governed by such
coalition Cabinets pending free elections.
   Bulgaria's Communists, drawing on a century of tradition and
facing a relatively weak opposition, have relinquished far less
power than their comrades in other states.
   Mladenov warned the delegates they could lose more power if the
party does not reform. But he said little to indicate he has
concrete plans for change.
   Mladenov admitted the economy is ``in tatters,'' but he was
vague on how to improve it. While saying the economy should be
market-oriented and allow for mixed forms of ownership, he said
this ``does not mean and cannot mean capitalist orientation.''
   All the country's mines were on strike last week, an
unprecedented wave of labor stoppages in postwar Bulgaria.
   Mladenov also gave no specifics on what share of power the
Communists would retain in a government of national accord.
   To date, the Communists have balked at such relatively simple
opposition demands as a share in radio and television broadcasts.

<TEXT>
   Waltham's American Legion band will march
in Moscow during the Soviet Union's annual May Day celebrations,
and the band leader knows the perfect tune for the occasion: ``God
Bless America.''
   Dorothy Hill said her three years of work had paid off, with the
band receiving permission to become the first to participate in the
Red Square festivities.
   Some 150 people, including Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn and more
than 70 band members, will make the trip April 28 to May 6, she
said Monday.
   ``I'm a veteran of World War II. I've seen three wars. I don't
want to see any more,'' Hill, band leader for more than 40 years,
said. ``I know I'm going to be playing `God Bless America' going
through Red Square.''
   Hill said she and former Mayor Arthur Clark had tried to enlist
Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, then speaker of the U.S. House, to help
set up the trip.
   O'Neill told Hill to wait for the political climate to improve.
She took his advice for a while, but later decided relations
between Moscow and Washington were warming too slowly.
   Four months ago she met Rudolph Peselman, a Soviet immigrant
living in another Boston suburb, Brookline, and working as an
international trader, acting as a middleman on U.S. and Soviet
business deals.
   The week before Peselman met Hill, the director of the Soviet
Peace Commission had expressed to him an interest in finding an
American band to play in Red Square.
   The commission later agreed to make the group's hotel and travel
arrangements.

<HEAD>Quayle in Panama: In Charge at the Locks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle got a
chance to work the Panama Canal locks during his day in this
isthmus nation, and seemed to relish the experience. ``I felt like
I was in charge,'' he said.
   Quayle threw the levers during a visit to the Miraflores locks
just outside Panama City that opened the gates so a
Liberian-registered freighter, Alpheos, could make its way through
the canal.
   As the ship laboriously inched through the narrow channel, the
beaming vice president asked reporters, ``How'd I do? Did you see
that ship coming through?''
   ``I opened the locks,'' he boasted. ``I felt like I was in
charge.''

   On the other hand, Quayle will never make it as a bargain hunter.
   He proved that when he stopped at a T-shirt stand on his way out
to the Miraflores locks.
   He picked out three for his children, bearing the slogan
``Operation Just Cause,'' the name for the U.S. military invasion
of Panama.
   The seller tried to give him the shirts, but Quayle said, ``Oh,
no, I have to pay. I insist.''
   She offered him the three for $10. But Quayle rejoined, ``I'll
tell you what, I'll give you $5 each.''
   She finally accepted the money. But then she had a request for
the vice president.
   ``Don't leave us unprotected,'' she said referring to the U.S.
invasion troops that remain in Panama.
   ``We will stay with Panama to see the democracy restored here,''
Quayle assured her. ``We want to make sure you have a good future
here.''

   There were plenty of people who live in the affluent hilltop
neighborhood near the U.S. ambassador who also want the U.S. troops
to stick around.
   ``Right now we don't feel safe. We don't go to the movies. We
don't go out,'' said Linda Lalo, owner of a sporting goods store
that was looted during the invasion.
   ``I'm afraid to open again because they steal everything,'' she
said.
   ``While we have faith in the new government, we haven't had
enough time to organize to protect ourselves. It's too early to
leave,'' said her friend, Yvonne Attie, whose husband is an owner
of a wholesale factory and shop.
   They said that the neighbors armed themselves and kept up
24-hour patrols during the invasion aftermath.
   Even now they are careful about moving about.
   ``I just went to the drug store. There was a bomb scare,'' said
Mrs. Lalo on the day Quayle was visiting. She said a man had been
taken hostage by robbers in one store, and she cautioned foreigners
not to go jogging after dark.
   Two teen-age girls curious for a glimpse of the vice president
wanted to know if it was true the invasion troops could be gone in
just two weeks.
   ``Don't they know there's a lot of insecurity here?'' the girls
asked?

   There weren't many people out and about when Quayle went to have
lunch at an oceanfront restaurant. But that was mostly because
soldiers blocked off the road around the place.
   Still, the vice president managed to find himself a vivacious
lunch partner.
   Among the few people in the restaurant was a young, attractive
woman with two small boys. Quayle went over and introduced himself
and asked them to join his table. The woman told her boys to stay
put and sat with Quayle's party, chatting animatedly throughout.
   Quayle's aides later disclosed why the woman probably had so
much to say _ she was the popular hostess of a local TV talk show,
Rosanna Uribe-Fernandez de Cordoba.

   Even in Panama, Super Bowl Sunday was a big event, and at the
Fort Clayton Army base, Quayle was part of the pre-game
entertainment.
   He stopped there to join a roomful of soldiers watching the game
on a big screen. While waiting for the kickoff, Quayle grabbed a
football and tossed it briefly with two women soldiers, who like
the others were dressed in battle fatigues and boots.
   The other soldiers appeared as delighted to watch as the women
were to play catch with Quayle.
   As they all settled in to watch the 49ers clobber the Broncos, a
reporter asked Quayle which team he was supporting.
   ``That's classified,'' the vice president replied
diplomatically.

   In boning up for his trip, Quayle sought advice from former
President Carter, but was unable to reach him because Carter was
traveling in Nicaragua.
   Although the former Democratic president might seem an unlikely
adviser to Quayle, one of the administration's most conservative
members, the vice president said he wanted to contact him because
of Carter's experience in the region.
   ``I wanted to talk to him about Latin American politics. He
spent a great deal of time traveling around, and also converse with
him a little bit about the situation in Nicaragua. I was interested
in his view of my trip and what I might expect and his
assessment,'' Quayle said.
   Carter has been welcomed by the Nicaraguan government as an
independent observer of the Feb. 25 elections. Managua has refused
to allow a congressional delegation that President Bush wants to
send.
   While the Bush administration has repeatedly criticized the
ruling Sandinistas for trying to choke the opposition's chances in
the election, Carter said Monday he believes the voting will be
fair and honest.
   He predicted ``a superb election.''

   A pipe bomb mailed to a church exploded this
morning, injuring the pastor's daughter, the church said.
   People near the Lakewood Church told police they heard a loud
pop and then a person screaming.
   Lisa Osteen, the 30-year-old daughter of the Rev. John Osteen,
pastor of the 10,000-member Baptist church, was taken to Ben Taub
Hospital, where she was in stable condition suffering from burns,
authorities said.
   KHOU-TV reported that the bomb contained six- to eight-inch
nails and that it blew up in Ms. Osteen's lap.
   There was no immediate confirmation from police.
   In December, nail-studded mail bombs killed a white judge near
Birmingham, Ala., and a black civil rights lawyer in Savannah, Ga.,
in related attacks investigators believe were motivated by race.
The Houston church is mostly white.
   Ms. Osteen was in an office in an auxiliary building across the
street from the main church when the bomb went off, the church said.
   ``We did have apparently a pipe bomb that came in a small
package just in our regular mail that was picked up at the local
post office today,'' an unidentified church spokeswoman told
reporter this morning.
   ``As normal procedure, Lisa Osteen opened the package, there was
an explosion and she did seem to have some injuries, but not
anything critical.''
   Calls to the church were answered by a recording saying,
``Hello, this is Lakewood Church. We have had a minor explosion
here in the church office. Everything is fine, we just want to
reassure you that everything is fine here at the church. We will be
off the phone for a short period of time. Thank you. God bless
you.''
   Investigators with the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms were en route to the church, the TV station said.
   Authorities were trying to find the postmark on the package, the
station said.
   The pastor was not at the church this morning. His daughter is
director of ministries there.

<HEAD>Mayors Group Blasts Bush Budget's Cuts in Urban Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Conference of Mayors decried on
Tuesday proposed cuts in urban funds in the Bush budget,
particularly what its executive director called a ``turkey list''
of reductions in some of the cities' major programs.
   ``We don't know who wrote it (the list), but mayors are
concerned they have been singled out,'' Thomas Cochran, the
organization's executive director, told a news conference.
   Cochran referred to a chapter in the Bush budget delivered to
Congress on Monday. The chapter, titled, ``Reducing Investment in
Low-Return Programs,'' calls for spending cuts in mass transit,
sewage plants, housing subsidies, student aid, low-income energy
assistance and other urban programs.
   Cochran said the message in the new budget is that urban
programs, which have been reduced 62 percent in the last 10 years,
will be cut again if Bush prevails in Congress.
   A proposed $163 million cut from the $2.9 billion authorized in
fiscal 1990 for the Community Development Grant program
particularly was a ``serious slap in the face,'' he said, because
it is the only major federal urban program remaining.
   Cochran said the conference ``would get our forces together'' to
persuade Cognress not to go along with the idea.
   At the same time, the conference official saT-R-E-S.''
   ``Good luck, and keep puzzling,'' the voice says before signing
off.
   The calls cost 75 cents for the first minute, 50 cents for every
additional minute.
   Nancy Nielson, a spokeswoman for the Times, said the
experimental service has been offered since Jan. 21 and may lead to
other interactive services sponsored by the newspaper. She said
there had not yet been any accounting of how many calls the service
had received.
   There is one small quirk in the system. Puzzlers who called
Tuesday were able to get answers to Wednesday's as-yet-unseen
puzzle by punching in the date 1-31. If you get stuck, 1 down is
WISH.

   More than 500 people took part in a
candlelight vigil and walk to mark the one-year anniversary of the
disappearance of a 14-year-old girl.
   The walk began Monday at Wells Middle School and ended at St.
Raymond's Catholic Church, the route believed to be the one Ilene
Misheloff took when she disappeared one year ago Tuesday.
   Mike and Maddie Misheloff, Ilene's parents, walked arm-in-arm at
the head of the procession.
   ``I am overwhelmed by the turnout,'' said Misheloff. ``We are
very pleased that all these people have come together, but we would
be even more pleased if the publicity leads to her release.''
   Ilene's brother, Robert, said he hoped the vigil sends a message
to his sister. ``She needs to know we love her. She needs to know
we care.''
   Police and the FBI continue to search for the missing teen-ager,
but no substantial leads have been developed.

   The $359 million project will cover the next six years, with the

   Known as NEXRAD, for Next Generation Weather Radar, the new
system is expected to improve weather forecasts and provide earlier

versions of the radar have been under test for several months.
   Doppler radar assists meteorologists by showing the direction of
wind and rain movement on radar screens. Traditional radars can

   The San Francisco 49ers' 55-10 rout of the
Denver Broncos was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in 21 years and the
third-lowest ever.
   The game on CBS averaged a 39.0 rating and a 63 share, the
lowest Super Bowl rating since 1969, when the New York Jets' 16-7
victory over Baltimore got a 36.0 on NBC for the worst rating ever,
A.C. Nielsen Co. said today.
   The rating is a percentage of the nation's televisions; each
point represents 921,000 homes. The share is the percentage of the
televisions on at the time.
   Despite the low rating, Sunday's game was seen by about 108.5
million people, making it the ninth most-watched TV show ever in
the United States behind eight Super Bowls and the final episode of
``MASH.'' The higher viewership was made possible by the annual
increase in the number of homes with television.
   ``Given the expected blowout, the numbers are completely
understandable and we're happy to have a 39,'' said Susan Kerr,
director of programming for CBS Sports. ``It's still a remarkable
rating for prime time.''
   The 49ers won by the biggest margin in Super Bowl history.
   Only the 1969 and 1968 Super Bowls had lower ratings; Green
Bay's 33-14 victory over Oakland in 1968 got a 36.8. The first
Super Bowl was in 1967.
   The highest-rated Super Bowl was in 1982, when the 49ers' 26-21
victory over Cincinnati got a 49.1 on CBS.
   Last year's San Francisco-Cincinnati Super Bowl, won by the
49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in 39.3 million homes,
according to Nielsen estimates. This year's game was seen in about
35.9 million homes.
   Viewership of the 5 p.m. game this year peaked at a 41.6 rating
and a 69 share from 6 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., dropping off as it became
clear that Denver would not rally.
   The pregame show got a 39.0 rating and a 63 share and the
postgame show got a 22.5 rating and a 35 share.
   The musical ``Annie,'' which was on ABC opposite the game, got a
9.4 rating. ``Life Goes On'' on NBC got a 6.0 rating and ``Love
With a Twist'' on NBC a 7.6.

<HEAD>Democrats Reject Appeal for Money for Nicaraguan Election</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Democratic Party has
rejected President Bush's appeal for contributions to the campaign
of Violeta Chamorro to be president of Nicaragua.
   ``We are not about to become a political action committee for
non-American candidates,'' party chairman Ronald H. Brown wrote to
Bush in a letter made public Tuesday.
   Brown said the Democrats supported Bush's request for a $9
million congressional appropriation to help Chamorro's campaign
against Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega.
   ``The Democratic Party and its leaders in Congress share your
hope that a free and fair electoral process in Nicaragua will help
that war-torn nation reconcile its differences and achieve peace,''
Brown wrote Bush.
   But, said Brown, ``I fear that your Jan. 24 appeal could be
interpreted as an attempt to politicize this issue in a harmful
way. Democrats do not believe that it is appropriate, proper, or
wise for our political parties to attempt to influence the outcome
of elections in a foreign country.
   Recalling that Bush once served as Republican Party chairman,
Brown said, ``You will well understand my own determination to use
the resources of my party to elect Democrats here at home.''
   In letters to the Republican and Democratic National committees,
Bush said that Mrs. Chamorro and her party, the National Opposition
Union, or UNO, were ``desparately short of funds needed for
campaign rallies, distributing campaign literature and media time.''
   The Nicaraguan election is scheduled for Feb. 25.
   Bush said the Sandinista government had ``imposed serious
obstacles'' to the delivery of funds appropriated by Congress and
``to date UNO has been permitted to make use of only a tiny
fraction of them. For these reasons, Mrs. Chamorro's campaign runs
the real risk of being crippled for lack of money.''
   The president urged the two U.S. parties to make an unspecified
joint contribution and urge their individual contributors to do the
same.

<HEAD>Ruling Delayed on Noriega POW Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A ruling on deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel
Noriega's claim that he can't be tried on drug charges because he
is a prisoner of war has been delayed a week, court officials said
Tuesday.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler had planned a status
conference Thursday on that issue and bond questions for two
Noriega co-defendants, but on Tuesday reset the hearing for Feb. 8.
   The Department of Justice is preparing a response to the POW
claim, said David Runkel, chief spokesman for the attorney general
in Washington.
   Noriega's trial on 1988 drug-trafficking charges is scheduled
for March 5, but Noriega's attorneys have repeatedly said it will
be postponed.
   The defense claims a federal judge has no jurisdiction in the
case because, under the Geneva Convention, Noriega was captured
during armed hostilities and is therefore a POW.
   Hoeveler has expressed skepticism.
   ``Just because he is found to be a prisoner of war would not
rule out the government's ability to bring him to trial,'' Hoeveler
said during a bond hearing Monday for co-defendants Luis del Cid
and Daniel Miranda.
   Noriega lawyers Frank Rubino and Steven Kollin have said they
are seeking to take the POW issue before an international forum,
possibly the World Court at The Hague, Netherlands.
   Since Sunday, Noriega has been held at the federal Metropolitan
Correctional Center in southwest Dade County. Noriega is under
24-hour guard and kept separate from all other prisoners.
   He spends 23 hours a day in an 86-square-foot cell equipped with
a bed, wash basin, toilet and a table. He is allowed into a
15-by-15-foot metal cage for one hour a day to exercise, prison
spokesman Charles Davis said.
   ``He can play handball against a wall, or walk around or do
calisthenics,'' Davis said. ``But he won't be engaged in any team
sports. He'll be out there by himself.''

<HEAD>Broadcasters Say Standards on Violence May Infringe Free Speech</HEAD>

   Proposed legislation that would clear the way
for industrywide standards on television sex and violence might
violate constitutional guarantees of free speech, a broadcaster
said Tuesday.
   Such standards could lead to areas ``in which the government is
more or less directing us as to how we should treat various
subjects,'' said Charles E. Sherman, senior vice president of the
National Association of Broadcasters.
   ``What then happens if another cause arises? Why then couldn't
another senator indicate that he thinks television should be more
positive?'' Sherman asked.
   Sherman's comments came at a roundtable discussion prompted by
the results of a three-year audit of television violence and
legislation proposed by Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., to restore some of
the industry's ability for self-regulation.
   ``There are still legal scholars and people who feel that we
would be subjected to First Amendment suits because we are indeed
following government directions in trying to come up with standards
on violence,'' Sherman said.
   The NAB, he said, had to defend the government-mandated ``family
viewing hour'' in lawsuits brought during the 1970s by unions for
both writers and directors who felt the restriction violated free
speech guarantees.
   ``Violence in television is changing our society and not for the
better,'' said Simon, urging the industry to develop its own
standards. He said his bill, the Television Violence and Indecent
Material Act, would allow that.
   The audit released Tuesday, part of a 22-year continuing study,
developed a television violence profile of programming on the three
major networks from 1986-1989.
   The study said 70 percent of prime-time programs use violence,
with between five and six violent acts per viewing hour. Half of
all prime-time dramatic characters are involved in violence,
according to the study.
   The report was most critical of children's weekend daytime
programming, saying it ``remains saturated with violence.''
   ``In each of the past three seasons, children were entertained
with more than 25 acts of (mostly humorous) violence per hour
committed by more than seven out of 10 characters in nine out of 10
programs,'' the study said.
   Simon has proposed granting limited anti-trust immunity for
three years to television broadcasters _ networks, cable
television, local stations, producers and industry trade groups _
to allow them to develop and apply written guidelines on TV
violence in entertainment programs.
   The bill is stalled in a House-Senate conference committee
because of an amendment included by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to
broaden its authority to guidelines on depictions of televised
sexual activity
   Beth W. Bressan, who oversees program standards and commercial
clearance for CBS, said the legislation wasn't necessary because it
is unclear how harmful or undesirable television violence is to
viewers.
   ``Last year, CBS received more than 600,000 pieces of mail,''
Bressnan said. ``Of that we had 92 viewers complaining that there
was too much violence.''
   Congress might do better ``to deal with the ills of society and
the violence of the climate in society rather than trying to clean
up the reflection of that society'' said Zev Braun, producer of the
top-rated series on the Vietnam War, ``Tour of Duty,'' which
includes graphic violence.

<HEAD>Moynihan Pitches Payroll Tax Cut to AARP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan on Tuesday
pitched his plan to cut Social Security taxes to the nation's
largest senior citizen group, disputing President Bush's claims
that the plan would lead to benefit cuts.
   The New York Democrat said the financial soundness of the system
would be protected under his proposal to reduce the payroll tax to
stop the government from using surplus Social Security revenues to
pay for other programs.
   ``There would be no risk to benefits at any time,'' he told the
American Association of Retired Persons. ``We are having the system
perform just as it was originally intended to do.''
   But at the White House, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
assailed Moynihan's proposal as ``the height of folly.''
   Brady said Americans have faith in the Social Security system as
it currently works. ``People don't talk about it. They think the
money is there'' in the Social Security trust funds.
   ``He says because of the surplus, you can reduce the taxes. I
say that's goofy,'' Brady said at a White House briefing.
   Moynihan's concern is that Social Security's growing trust fund
reserves are being used to mask the true size of the federal
deficit and to pay for other government programs. His solution is
to halt the buildup of the reserves and return Social Security to a
pay-as-you-go system in which taxes would be raised in the next
century to finance retirement benefits paid out then.
   Moynihan said that if the government continues to use the trust
funds for other purposes, it could cause a loss of trust that could
be a ``seismic event.''
   ``This has the makings of a massive loss of trust,'' he said.
   Moynihan said the government should be forced to stop using
Social Security revenues for other purposes before it becomes
``inextricably dependent'' on them.
   ``Now is the moment to do it,'' Moynihan said. ``You wait five
years ... and they will have a $3 billion-a-week habit.''
   Moynihan rejected the Bush administration's rival proposal to
gradually shift the Social Security surpluses out of the deficit
calculations, saying it puts off dealing with the problem.
   The senator addressed the AARP's national legislative council,
which has not yet taken a position on his proposal. Speaking to
reporters after his speech, Moynihan indicated that his tax-cut
plan may become intertwined in Congress with the president's
proposed cut in the capital gains tax.
   ``If a capital gains tax comes to the floor of the United States
Senate, there's going to be an amendment,'' he said.

   An AeroCancun jetliner carrying 166
passengers aborted takeoff after one of its two engines failed and
skidded off a runway early Tuesday, officials said.
   No one was injured in the 12:30 a.m. incident at the Greater
Rochester International Airport.
   ``He didn't go airborne, but was very close to where he would
have been committed,'' airport administrator Ronald Durand said.
``I would say it was a matter of seconds before he would have
gotten airborne.''
   The DC-9, a charter flight headed for Cancun, Mexico, wound up
mired in mud and snow at the end of the runway.
   Federal Aviation Administration manager William Reed said the
engine may have failed after ingesting snow or a chunk of ice.

   A Floria lawyer accused of conspiracy
in the kidnapping of socialite Annie Laurie Hearin had blamed Ms.
Hearin's husband for the loss of his property, a prosecutor said in
opening statements today.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Patricia Bennett also said a man
resembling defendant Newton Alfred Winn of St. Petersburg was seen
in Ms. Hearin's neighborhood in a white van a week before her
kidnapping.
   She said the evidence will also show he wasn't seen by family
and friends in Florida between July 23 and 28, 1988.
   Winn, 65, says he is innocent and was in St. Petersburg when
Mrs. Hearin was abducted from her Jackson home July 26, 1988. Mrs.
Hearin, then 72, has not been found.
   Mrs. Hearin's husband, Robert M. Hearin, is among Mississippi's
wealthiest people, with investments in oil, gas and banking. His
fortune is estimated at $100 million.
   A note discovered in the foyer of the Hearin home listed 12
people, including Winn, who had been involved in legal battles with
School Pictures, Inc., a business in which Hearin had been a
stockholder.
   Bennett charged that Winn held Hearin responsible for a 1983
lawsuit filed by School Pictures against him. As a result, Winn's
property was seized and sold in October 1986.
   Winn is charged with conspiracy to kidnap, mailing a threatening
letter and perjury. If convicted on all charges, he faces up to
life in prison.
   No one has been charged with carrying out the kidnapping itself.
   ``There's another side to the story,'' defense attorney Ed
Marger argued today. ``In this case, the evidence will explicitly
show that the government cannot show that my client is guilty.''
   Before opening statements, Marger argued for admission of tape
recordings that he said contain evidence of misconduct by an FBI
agent and Robert Hearin Jr., the missing woman's son.
   ``They are sensational because they reflect a relationship
between the Hearin family and the FBI that is improper,'' Marger
said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Tucker said intercepting and
recording conversations is illegal and that the law prohibits the
tapes from being used.
   ``It doesn't matter that it was a cellular phone,'' Tucker said.
``That just makes it a misdemeanor.''
   U.S. District Judge Tom Lee said he needed to research the law
before ruling on the request but returned the tapes to the defense,
saying the wiretap law apparently doesn't apply.
   Hearin mailed checks totaling nearly $1 million to the 12 people
named in the ransom note. Winn returned his $145,000 check.
   Winn is accused of arranging for a second ransom note to Hearin.
   The letter, in Mrs. Hearin's handwriting, said her captors would
seal her in a cellar if the nearly $1 million was not paid to the
12 former franchise holders of School Pictures of Mississippi.
   Hearin paid the money after the second letter arrived at his
home.

   Talks between Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze have
been postponed a day because of a meeting of the Communist Party
Central Committee, the State Department said today.
   Baker and Shevardnadze will meet Feb. 8-9 in the Soviet capital
at the suggestion of the U.S. government, said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler. They had planned to hold their
talks Feb. 7-8.
   The one-day delay was announced as Cable News Network reported
that Mikhail S. Gorbachev was considering resigning as chief of the
Communist Party while retaining his post as Soviet president.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the CNN report,
``I have no idea. We've never heard of it before. I have no
information.''
   CNN, in a report from Moscow, quoted a ``well-informed and
usually reliable Communist Party source'' as saying Gorbachev ``may
try to leave his closest ally, Alexander Yakovlev, in charge of the
Communist Party while he follows popular pressure to remove the
party from its monopoly control of political power.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said of the delay in the Baker-Shevardnadze talks,
``It simply makes more sense to have the Soviets complete their
plenum before beginning this important ministerial.''
   The issues to be discussed in the talks include arms control and
the war in Afghanistan between the Soviet-backed government and
U.S.-armed rebels.

<HEAD>Militias Clash for Control of Christian Heartland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maverick Christian Gen. Michel Aoun
ordered his troops Tuesday to take over all bases of a rival
militia as the sides prepared to fight for control of the Christian
heartland.
   Police said five combatants were wounded when Aoun's 8th Brigade
stormed a major barracks of the Lebanese Forces, the Christians'
main militia, in east Beirut.
   Crack commandos of the 8th Brigade, trained by U.S. Marines in
1983, seized the militia's Tahwita barracks in the residential
district of Furn el-Shubbak after a 90-minute firefight, a police
statement said.
   The army claimed militiamen shot down several posters of Aoun
with rocket-propelled grenades in the low-income neighborhood and
then took shelter in the base.
   ``Troops seized the Tahwita barracks and rounded up the
outlaws,'' said a police statement issued in east Beirut. It did
not give the number of arrests.
   It said four of the injured were Lebanese Forces militiamen and
one an Aoun soldier. All were hospitalized.
   Aoun, in a statement issued on his Radio Lebanon station, said
he had ordered his 20,000 troops to take over all other barracks of
the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces militia throughout the Christian
enclave.
   ``No militia barracks are allowed henceforth to remain in the
eastern area,'' Aoun's statement said. ``Anyone who wants to carry
arms should join the army. The country cannot be rebuilt if it
still has militias.''
   The declaration suggested a long-expected showdown was imminent
between Aoun and the Lebanese Forces commander, Samir Geagea, the
only Christian warlord with the potential to challenge Aoun's
authority in the enclave.
   The Lebanese Forces have four major bases controlling the
enclave's 30-mile Mediterranean coast.
   Voice of Free Lebanon radio said Geagea was holding crisis talks
with senior aides ``in an effort to defuse the confrontation.''
   Aoun's troops control the mountaintops of the 310-square-mile
enclave in the Metn and upper regions as well as all inlets from
west Beirut, the northern district of Batroun and the central
mountains.
   Aoun moved against the Lebanese Forces in February last year,
when his troops flushed out the militia from Metn in a four-day
crackdown that left 82 people killed and 200 wounded.
   The new inter-Christian shootout came as Aoun's troops and
Syrian-backed Moslem militiamen skirmished intermittently with
automatic fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line. Police said
four people were wounded.
   Police said Aoun's troops established complete control over Furn
el-Shubbak and the adjacent residential districts of Ein
el-Rummaneh and Sinn el-Fil in east Beirut by nightfall.
   There was no word whether the troops would push against the
Lebanese Forces' main strongholds in and around Jounieh.
   Rumors have been sweeping east Beirut recently about mounting
differences between Aoun and the Lebanese Forces. Both Geagea and
Aoun have repeatedly denied such reports, despite their open
disagreement over recognizing President Elias Hrawi as head of
state.
   Geagea recognizes Hrawi, elected president Nov. 24 under an Arab
League-brokered plan to end Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Aoun, however, has rejected the peace accord because it does not
include a deadline for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from
Lebanon. He also refused to recognize Hrawi's election.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Tuesday pleaded for
reconciliation and unity in this African country still recovering
from civil war and hostilities with Libya.
   ``After the ordeals, the country is now on the road to
renewal,'' the pontiff said. ``Chadians have chosen the path of
unity and peace. I hope this peace consolidates itself ... in a
constant search for forgiveness and reconciliation.''
   The pope traveled to Chad from Burkina Faso on the final leg of
an eight-day, five-nation tour of the impoverished Sahel region.
   Repression by the then-Christian government in 1965 against
Moslem populations in the center and north of Chad led to fighting
throughout the country which ceased only two years ago.
   In August, Chad and Libya agreed to put an end to 16 years of
hostility and agreed to reach a political settlement over the
45,000-square-mile Aouzou Strip that separates them.
   Chad, however, says Libya continues to support rebel incursions
into its territory from neighboring Sudan.
   The pope did not mention the Libyan dispute in his speeches.
   ``Your country has known much suffering, suffering due to
drought and famine, suffering due to painful years of war,'' the
pope said during a service at N'Djamena's Cathedral of Our Lady of
Victories.
   ``Have confidence in life, have confidence in others, in order
to rebuild ... a better Chad, a reconciled Chad,'' he said.
   The cathedral was gutted by mortar fire in 1980 during fighting
between forces led by the current president, Hissene Habre, and his
Libyan-backed archrival Goukouni Oueddei, president from 1980 to
June 1982.
   The arched-roof yellow cathedral was restored in 1986 and sits
on an open field in the center of town, in front of a military camp.
   ``I see this city reborn from ruins and discover tonight that
your cathedral is bathed in youth and light,'' the pope said.
   The pope was greeted at the airport by Habre, a 47-year-old
Moslem French-trained administrator and one-time guerrilla leader.
A drum-and-bugle corps played the national anthem and ``Marching
Through Georgia'' as a 21-gun salute was fired by French armored
vehicles.
   In his airport speech, the pope offered his greetings to the
country's Moslems.
   ``I salute them and assure them that I come as a man of dialogue
and messenger of peace,'' he said in French.
   Chad has an estimated 5.5 million people, fewer than 400,000 of
whom are Roman Catholics. Moslems account for about half of the
population.
   The pope spends Wednesday in Chad before returning to Rome on
Thursday. He also has visited Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Mali.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration joined human rights
activists Tuesday in pushing for Senate ratification of a U.N.
convention banning torture, but the ranking Republican on the
Foreign Relations Committee expressed reservations about the
measure.
   Abraham D. Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, told
the Foreign Relations Committee the administration ``places a high
priority on early ratification of this important human rights
treaty for substantive as well as symbolic reasons.''
   While the convention ``breaks little new ground'' and would be
unnecessary in the United States, Sofaer said it would put the
United States in the forefront of the issue.
   Nevertheless, Sofaer said the United States would insist on some
``protective measures'' in the convention, which makes all acts of
torture criminal offenses and requires parties to extradite those
accused of torture.
   A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required for ratification,
but the Foreign Relations Committee must first vote on the issue.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said he wanted to hold more
discussions with the administration before a vote is scheduled.
   ``Nobody favors torture,'' Helms said, while at the same time
raising questions about the convention.
   He said he was disturbed that countries such as Afghanistan,
Bulgaria, China and the Soviet Union have ratified the convention,
countries Helms said have promoted serious human rights abuses.
   Rhetorically, he wondered if parties to the convention had
condemned China for the massacre of students last summer in
Beijing. ``I guess running over people with tanks is not torture,''
he said.
   The convention has been ratified by 55 nations, including Libya,
a nation the United States has accused of promoting terrorism.
   Quizzed about Libya's membership, Sofaer said the United States
would use the convention as a forum to promote change in places
such as Libya.
   Twenty-two nations have signed the treaty, indicating they
intend to ratify it.
   The torture convention came into force on June 26, 1987. Under
the convention, a committee of 10 experts was established with
power to investigate allegations of torture and receive reports.
   A number of human rights and other groups have supported the
convention, among them Amnesty International, the U.S. Catholic
Conference, B'nai B'rith International, and the American Bar
Association.
   ``U.S. adherence to the convention against torture is of
unquestioned importance,'' said Winston P. Nagan, the chairman of
Amnesty International.

   An unusually elusive pair of bandits dubbed
``Bonnie and Clyde'' have led police on a frustrating chase around
New England, allegedly robbing 27 stores and tying up clerks at
knifepoint in the past five weeks.
   But the duo's age makes them more like Bonnie and Clyde's
parents.
   Police are seeking Edward M. Aranjo, 46, and Ellen M. Marks, 50,
in the spree, which grew to 27 with two robberies Monday. No one
has been injured.
   In the mode of operation typical of all the crimes, a
middle-aged couple threatened a 68-year-old woman with a knife and
tied her to a pipe Monday before robbing her Franklin bookstore
cash register of $130.
   That night, a Burlington video store was robbed and Bonnie and
Clyde were the prime suspects again. Phone lines were cut, and a
male clerk was held at knifepoint and tied up. The pair reportedly
escaped with $160 in cash and $1,500 worth of instant lottery
tickets.
   ``Their pictures are out there on TV so maybe they just want to
go for it before they throw in the towel,'' said police Capt. Alan
Leach of Coventry, R.I., one of dozens of police detectives
tracking the case. ``All we know is, they're moving awfully fast.''
   Police believe they're moving in a stolen car with Massachusetts
plates.
   Leach said he saw the pair referred to as Bonnie and Clyde in a
police Teletype message.
   Since Dec. 26, when a West Warwick, R.I., store was robbed of
$65, Aranjo and Marks are alleged to have robbed small shops in
Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and
Massachusetts.
   The pair believed responsible for all of the crimes have rarely
taken off more than two days between heists, police said. They are
believed to sometimes dye their hair and wear hats and sunglasses,
but otherwise they are not heavily disguised, police said.
   Their biggest take so far has been $400, in the town of
Attleboro.
   ``They're sure not going for a million dollars at one fell
swoop,' said Leach.
   He believes they have holed up in a series of motel rooms and
rooming houses in eastern Massachusetts, moving at least 15 times
in the last two months.
   Typically, the robberies have occurred at small stores with just
a single clerk, said police Detective Kevin Slattery of Framingham,
where a store was hit Jan. 8. He said the male member of the team
has brandished a large hunting knife.
   Leach said Aranjo has a lengthy criminal record including
convictions on larceny charges and assault with a deadly weapon.
   Coventry police said Aranjo and Marks were arrested by
Framingham police in July but Leach said he did not know on what
charges. Coventry police would not comment.
   Both Aranjo and Marks are originally from Framingham, a
community about 20 miles west of Boston.
   Marks' husband, who is being treated in an alcoholic
rehabilitation clinic, has said he is dumbfounded by any possible
role his wife might have in the spree and speculated she may have
been coerced.
   George Marks told The Boston Herald that his wife met Aranjo
when he drove her to the clinic for visits.
   Leach said that while no one has been injured, ``everyone
reports being threatened and scared.''
   The daughter of the woman held up at Annie's Book Stop in
Franklin _ police would not release her name _ said she was shaken
but otherwise unharmed. ``I was afraid she would go into shock,''
the daughter said while waiting for her mother at the police
station. ``She couldn't stop crying.
   ``Her pocketbook was scattered all over, like they were looking
for the keys to something. They didn't take her credit cards or
anything.''

<TEXT>
   Pam Jones huddled under a
tattered umbrella on a muddy patch outside this U.S. air base,
where women have kept up an anti-nuclear vigil for nearly nine
years.
   The base is to be closed in 1991, a symbol of the changing face
of Europe, but Ms. Jones isn't leaving yet. ``We'll see it through
to the end. No one will ever forget Greenham Common,'' she said
Tuesday.
   Surrounded by a dismal clutter of broken chairs, plastic
sheeting and the dying embers of a fire, she said, ``It's a time of
celebration.''
   Greenham Common has been a U.S. base for nearly 50 years. It's
where Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower saw off his D-Day invasion troops,
and it has been a rallying point for the anti-nuclear movement
since it became a base for cruise missiles.
   It is one of 14 foreign military installations that U.S. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney is proposing to close in a cost-cutting
measure.
   Cheney's announcement Monday was a blow to many of the local
people in the wealthy, conservative Berkshire countryside around
Greenham Common, 50 miles west of London. The base employs nearly
200 Britons and spends $40 million a year locally.
   ``We'll miss the Americans economically and we'll miss them as
people,'' said Ted Ashton, chatting in the Ploughman, a local pub.
   ``When you play poker you deal from strength _ and that's what
the Americans did here and it worked,'' said Ashton, 68. ``It's all
been worthwhile.''
   Mostly, the locals disdain the dozens of women who since 1981
have protested outside the base, but they more or less learned to
put up with them.
   They also became used to the cruise missiles trundling on
cumbersome launchers through the country lanes on exercises that
became known as ``walkies.''
   The big peace demonstrations of the 1980s, when Greenham Common
was the focus of anti-nuclear protest in Western Europe, are just a
memory.
   The protesters? ``They're an absolute nuisance and they've
achieved nothing,'' said Ashton.
   But Ms. Jones, 35, a former secretary with a punk haircut who
first camped at Greenham Common three years ago, thinks the
protests and her vigil have been worthwhile. ``Women have gained
enormous strength here, and it will always be a symbol of the peace
movement,'' she said.
   Half the 110 cruise missiles deployed at Greenham Common have
gone since the signing of the 1987 U.S.-Soviet agreement to
eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles from Europe. The rest will
be out by mid-1991.
   After that, under the new Pentagon proposals, Greenham Common
will become a standby base, non-operational, with about 400
American personnel, compared with 1,645 now.
   A local movement is campaigning to transform the 1,046-acre base
into a park.
   Left behind will be the concrete bunkers, part of the missiles'
$105 million home; the VIP lounges spruced up for the Soviet
inspectors who drop by under the 1987 treaty; and a long history.
   The United States took over the airfield during World War II,
and from here Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, broadcast
to forces braced for the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe on June
5, 1944. ``The eyes of the world are upon you tonight,'' he told
them.
   The women first pitched camp here in 1981, and 200 were living
at the base's eight gates when the first cruise missiles to be
deployed in Western Europe arrived at Greenham Common in November
1983.
   They became not just a peace movement, but a focal point of
militant feminism, from which men are excluded.
   A half-dozen remain. As some move on, others come, staying for a
few days or a few years. Thousands of women have lived at Greenham
_ through rain, sleet and sunshine. They still break into the base,
climb aboard the missile launchers or lie down in front of them.
   Hundreds have gone to prison for refusing to pay fines for
damage or obstruction.
   It has been a long standoff between the U.S. troops and the
women.
   ``I wouldn't say either side has won,'' said Lt. Mike Rein, the
Air Force spokesman at Greenham Common. ``They have the issues they
stand for and we have ours.''

<HEAD>Investigator: Pilot Had Discretion on Fuel Emergency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MELVILLE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of the Avianca flight that
crashed and killed 73 people had complete discretion in determining
whether his Boeing 707 was in a fuel emergency and needed to land
immediately, an investigator said Tuesday.
   Barry Trotter of the National Transportation Safety Board, the
investigator in charge of the crash probe, said Avianca does not
require pilots to declare a fuel emergency when levels drop below a
certain point, he said.
   Officials at American Airlines and Pan American World Airways,
which both had flights diverted from Kennedy International Airport
the night of the crash, said the final decision on fuel emergencies
on their flights rested with the pilot.
   A possible miscommunication between controllers has been raised
in the crash, although federal officials defended the controllers
on Monday. A final report on the cause of the crash is not expected
for nine to 12 months.
   Investigators said Monday that tapes show the crew warned
regional air traffic controllers that their fuel was low as they
circled over New Jersey, about 45 minutes before the crash.
   That information was not explicitly relayed to the local
controllers who were to guide the plane to Kennedy. The plane
apparently ran out of gas and slammed into a hillside Thursday on
New York's Long Island. The captain, Laureano Caviedes Hoyes, was
one of the 73 people killed. Eighty-six people survived.
   The captain also asked for ``priority'' to land rather than
declaring an ``emergency'' in telling the controller he could only
stay in hold for another five minutes.
   Trotter said the controllers responded to the priority request
by moving the flight from a holding pattern to an approach pattern,
although the plane was not moved to the first slot among
approaching planes. The plane's 37-minute wait during approach was
not unusual due to the heavy traffic and bad weather, he said.
   ``Ultimately, it's the captain, although it's the function of
interaction between the crew,'' said Pan Am spokesman Jeff
Kriendler.
   An American Airlines jet was brought in shortly before the crash
when its pilot told controllers it had just 14 minutes of fuel
remaining. American spokeswoman Mary O'Neill said, ``It's the
pilot's final say.''
   Pilots who land without adequate reserve fuel are liable to be
called on the carpet by the airlines or by federal authorities,
Trotter said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration reported that in the two
hours before the crash, 13 arriving planes experienced delays
averaging 89 minutes at JFK and 33 planes were diverted to other
airports. Winds reached 70 mph and wind-shear warnings were up.
   The pilot had 17 years experience flying into Kennedy, including
three trips the month before the tragedy, Trotter said.
   But the air traffic controller he spoke with at the regional
control center had just over six months full-level experience, he
said. The other controllers involved at Kennedy and two other sites
had an average of eight years experience, Trotter said.
   The NTSB planned to send investigators to Colombia this week to
review maintenance records and gather other information about the
plane, Trotter said.
   Trotter said foreign Avianca pilots must meet certain
requirements in speaking and understanding English before they can
fly in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Spoleto Festival USA has gotten a $246,000 hike
in its budget for this year's annual art fair in Charleston, S.C.,
because of damage caused by Hurricane Hugo.
   The board of directors met in New York on Monday and approved
the revised budget for the festival, which will be held May 25
through June 10. A preliminary budget of $3.9 million was approved
by the board in October.
   The increase is necessary because of storm damage to some of the
buildings used by the festival and other financial conditions, said
board treasurer Melvin Solomon.
   Hurricane Hugo crashed ashore in Charleston on Sept. 21, killing
29 and causing $5.9 billion in damage in South Carolina.
   The board usually meets this time of year in Charleston, but it
met in New York because of a gala benefit held Monday at Lincoln
Center.
   The benefit was expected toraise at least $200,000 for the
festival, the Gibbes Museum of Art, the Charleston Symphony
Orchestra and the Trident Community Foundation.
   Much of the festival's programming already has been announced,
including a repeat of last year's production of ``The Marriage of
Figaro,'' a presentation of the medieval version of ``Tristan and
Isolde,'' the theatrical version of ``Salome'' and a opening night
gala with Leonard Bernstein on the podium.

<HEAD>Darman Defends Bush Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman
on Tuesday defended President Bush's $1.23 trillion budget against
Democratic criticism of gimmickry and rosy predictions and tried to
snuff out a movement to cut Social Security taxes.
   There are far fewer ``gimmicks,'' such as shifting payments from
one year to another to make the deficit look smaller, than in past
budgets, Darman told the House Budget Committee.
   ``I think everyone of them (in the new budget) is defensible,''
he said.
   As for projections of greater economic growth and less inflation
than private economists are forecasting, Darman pointed to the
administration's figures from July as ``amazingly accurate.''
   ``You are not dealing with people who are totally out of
bounds,'' he said.
   Darman spent most of the day before the committee listening to
Democratic members complain that the budget, which Bush sent to
Congress on Monday, does not reflect a changing world because it
proposes $292.1 billion for the military in the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1.
   ``You've blown the opportunity for economic growth by spending
more on military,'' said Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.
   She said the administration proposal to save money starting in
1994 by eliminating several military bases was an effort to
intimidate lawmakers who might prefer less spending for defense.
   ``Why are some kinds of cuts good but other kinds are not?''
Darman asked.
   Darman was peppered with questions about Social Security,
specifically a bill by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. That
bill, which has drawn the interest of several lawmakers but
opposition from the administration, would cut payroll taxes as a
way to keep the government from using surplus Social Security taxes
to finance other federal programs.
   ``It is my personal opinion that he (Moynihan) never intended
the plan to be taken as seriously as the press has taken it,''
Darman said, implying that Moynihan was simply trying to draw
attention to the practice of using Social Security taxes for
purposes other than providing benefits to retirees.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the committee,
interjected: ``I get the impression that he is quite serious about
the proposal.''
   At the White House, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told
reporters Moynihan's proposal ``is the height of folly'' and
``goofy.''
   Bush's budget proposes that once the federal deficit is
eliminated _ and predicts that will be in 1993 _ Social Security
taxes that are not needed to pay benefits immediately be used only
to retire government debt.
   Darman bristled when Rep. James Slattery, D-Kan., said ``Social
Security is the biggest lie we have told the American people in
maybe this generation,'' calling Bush's proposed remedy ``another
scam, another scam.''
   ``You're saying ... that (federal) debt is no good, that we are
bankrupt,'' Darman said. ``The day that ... U.S. treasuries
(securities) are no good is a day I think none of us will ever see.
   ``Our proposal is not smoke and mirrors. It will really get the
debt down. ... There isn't a trace of dishonesty in this
presentation.''
   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the Budget
Committee, threw Darman one of the few bouquets during the hearing.
   ``I happen to think it (the budget) is a pretty good
beginning,'' he said.
   Panetta said he found more gimmicks in the budget than Darman
acknowledged.
   ``If the president is not serious about confronting the deficit
issue, why should Congress be serious?'' Panetta asked.
   ``Of course the president is serious,'' Darman retorted. ``I am
serious. ... I wish you had taken that on faith.''
   As for gimmicks, he said he has a list of more than 100 that
Congress has used to reduce the deficit.
   The new budget anticipates a $63.1 billion deficit in fiscal
1991, although congressional economists say the figure is likely to
approach $100 billion. The budget would rely on spending
reductions, user fees and selected tax increases _ but no general
boost in income taxes _ to cut the deficit from the 1990 level of
about $124 billion.
   ``I don't see a single tough choice in your budget,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. ``At a time when this president has the
political support ... (to push through a radically changed budget)
he just sort of walks away from it.''
   Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., said the budget reflects ``a view
of America that is not shared by a lot of people in my district.''
   ``There's more to what we are doing than perhaps your
constituents know,'' Darman replied.

<HEAD>Bush's New Budget: Will It Set the Stage for New Taxes?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON AP) _ To hear some members of Congress tell it,
President Bush's ``no new taxes'' budget may have just set the
stage for a $20 billion tax increase this year.
   As the administration launched a defense of its tax and spending
blueprint Tuesday, various influential Democrats said they viewed
the Bush budget as an open invitation to raise taxes given the fact
that Bush included a number of ``revenue raisers'' in his own
budget.
   Both House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and
Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said they
were willing to accept Bush's proposal to raise revenues by $21.7
billion but they said that Congress was likely to radically alter
the mix on how that money was obtained.
   ``That revenue figure in total is something that we an accept,''
Sasser said. ``Unfortunately, in Bush's budget, it is not
legitimately achieved.''
   While the president proclaimed that his 1991 spending plan would
slash the deficit in half ``without raising taxes,'' the budget
actually included a hodge-podge of increases in taxes and user fees
that would bring in an additional $21.7 billion in the 1991 fiscal
year, which starts next October.
   The Bush budget proposes $15.7 billion in new tax revenue, which
is offset by $1.8 billion in tax cuts.
   In addition, the president proposes raising $5.6 billion in new
user fees charged for providing government services, $1.6 billion
in the sale of government assets and $600 million in other new
receipts, bringing the total to $21.7 billion.
   Critics of the Bush budget charge that the administration has
recycled a variety of proposals, many dating back to the Reagan
administration, that Congress has rejected in the past.
   One retread is a proposal to assess federal Social Security
taxes on state and local government employees in the handful of
states who are not now covered by the levy, a $3.8 billion revenue
raiser that Bush unsuccessfully sought last year.
   Other proposed revenue increases would extend the soon-to-expire
3 percent tax on long distance telephone calls, increase the tax on
airline tickets from 8 percent to 10 percent and pick up $2.5
billion by beefed up enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service.
   Bush's biggest revenue raiser for next year is actually a tax
cut, the proposed reduction in the capital gains tax, the levy on
profits made from the sale of assets such as stocks or real estate.
   Bush estimates that would bring in $4.9 billion in additional
money in 1991 as people rushed to sell assets to take advantage of
the lower tax, but critics charge that the proposal would lose
money in later years because of the lower tax bite.
   Panetta suggested that Congress might consider compromising on
the capital gains cut sought by Bush if the president was willing
to consider tax increases in other areas, possibly a higher top tax
rate for individuals or a boost in energy taxes.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told reporters Tuesday that
the administration was optimistic about the chances for getting a
reduction in capital gains passed this year after failing to do so
in 1988.
   ``All of the comments I have heard by returning congressmen and
senators indicate to me that they think it has even a better
chance'' this year, Brady said.
   But complicating the tax debate this year is a rival plan by
Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., to slash Social Security taxes by $62
billion in 1990 and 1991 by rolling back two scheduled rate
increases.
   Brady, speaking to reporters at the White House, said the
administration would not support Moynihan's proposal as part of a
bargain to get the capital gains tax cut approved and he assailed
Moynihan's proposal as ``goofy.''
   Brady said that Americans have faith in the Social Security
system as it currently works.
   ``People don't talk about it. They think the money is there'' in
the Social Security trust funds, Brady said, terming Moynihan's
proposal to return the surplus to taxpayers as ``the height of
folly.''
   ``He says because of the surplus, you can reduce the taxes. I
say that's goofy,'' Brady said.
   If Bush does accept revenue increases as part of the
negotiations over his new budget, it would not be the first time.
Last November, as part of a deal to reach an agreement on a budget
for the current fiscal year, Bush accepted almost $8 billion in tax
increases and nearly $2 billion in tax cuts, for a net tax increase
of $6 billion.
   The agreement was part of a $14.7 billion package of measures,
including spending cuts, to reduce the size of the 1990 deficit,
currently estimated at $123.8 billion.

   A man who was badly injured in the
crash of a Colombian jet has passed 18 condoms containing cocaine,
police said Tuesday.
   The man, Antonio Zuluaga, is the second passenger from the
airline who allegedly had swallowed packages of cocaine. Another
man, Jose Figeroa, was found to have packets of cocaine in his
intestines when doctors operated on him the day after the crash to
stop internal bleeding, authorities said.
   Nassau County Detective Brian McCormack said a nurse at the
County Medical Center called police Monday night to report that
Zuluaga, 46, had passed four condoms containing cocaine.
   Sgt. Richard Snizek said the man has since passed 14 more
packages. Each measures about three-fourths of an inch by 1{ inches
and has about 8 grams of the drug.
   Zuluaga has been charged with possession of cocaine.
   He is in critical condition with a fractured spine, broken ribs,
a dislocated hip and possibly a broken knee.

of Medellin crashed in Cove Neck late Thursday, killing 73 people.

   A senior Communist Party official on Tuesday
accused Azerbaijani leaders of not taking strong enough action to
prevent ethnic violence in the southern republic.
   Vyacheslav A. Mikhailov, the No. 2 official at the party Central
Committee's Ethnic Relations Department, said Azerbaijani officials
used ``slack tactics'' in dealing with extremists in the
Azerbaijani People's Front, the grass-roots political group that
has organized anti-Armenian protests.
   Azerbaijan's party chief, Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, lost his job
and was expelled from the party Jan. 24 after being accused of
serious mistakes that led to the bloodshed.
   Anti-Armenian riots broke out in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku
on Jan. 13, and Soviet troops stormed into the city a week later.
At least 197 people have been killed in the strife, by official
count, with 125 of them dying after the arrival of Soviet troops.
   Mikhailov told reporters the Azerbaijani authorities did not act
to prevent the rampages. He said they could have ``isolated
extremists'' and denounced them but instead granted them
``concession after concession.''
   The Moscow official also said some members of Azerbaijan's law
enforcement agencies ``did not adopt the best form of behavior.''
He did not elaborate.
   Some Armenian refugees from Baku have claimed police did nothing
to stop terrorists from attacking them.
   Extremists took advantage of authorities' inactivity to incite
nationalist hysteria, Mikhailov told a news conference.
   It should have been clear to Azerbaijani officials, he said,
that attacks on Armenians were ``deeply thought out.''
   He said Moscow officials will be following closely how the newly
installed Azerbaijani leadership copes with the unrest and works to
restore people's faith.
   Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow, reported that
extremists blocked buses and trams in Baku on Tuesday and forced
passengers off of them.
   The official news agency Tass reported that no shots were fired
in Baku Tuesday morning. It quoted the city's military commandant
as saying the city was gradually returning to normal, with mass
transit, stores and other businesses open. A total of 36 people
were detained in the previous 24 hours in Baku for violating
emergency regulations, the dispatch said.
   Tass said extremists seized a mosque and disrupted businesses in
the Hachmassk region of Azerbaijan. It said six ``terrorists'' were
detained.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed region of Azerbaijan that is
populated mainly by Armenians, the regional governing body
condemned the ``anti-Armenian policy of the Azerbaijani
leadership.''
   In an appeal to the national legislature in Moscow,
Nagorno-Karabakh's legislature also rejected Azerbaijan's right to
govern the district because ``Armenians in Azerbaijan are facing
genocide.'' The appeal was reported by Interfax.

<HEAD>State Department Protests Romania's Treatment Of Opposition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department on Tuesday accused the
ruling National Salvation Front in Romania of intimidating the
political opposition and said the department's human rights
director, Richard Schifter, was in Bucharest ``forcefully stating
our concerns.''
   Alan Green Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Romania, lodged a protest
``and asked that the right of all political groups to peaceful
protests be fully protected,'' Margaret D. Tutwiler, a department
spokeswoman, said.
   ``We will be greatly saddened if the hope for democracy and
human rights, won at such great human cost in Romania, were to be
lost by a retreat to the habits and practices of an old
totalitarian era that should be completely discarded,'' she said.
   The front, in power since the ouster Dec. 22 of Nicolae
Ceausescu, has organized massive demonstrations in Bucharest in
response to a protest Sunday by three opposition parties. The
pro-government demonstrators have demanded the dissolution of the
opposition Peasants' Party and Liberal Party.
   ``We are deeply troubled by what appears to be active
intimidation of legitimate organizations which are seeking a
legitimate, independent role in Romania's new political order,''
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The stern statement was the latest in a series criticizing
actions by the front. So far, the State Department has not directly
challenged either its authority or the justice system in Romania,
which led to the summary execution of Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena, and the trial, now underway, of ousted hard-liners.
   On Monday, Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said
anti-front demonstrators were protesting the predominance of
Communists in the provisional government and the front's recent
decision to run candidates in elections scheduled for May 20.
   ``There should be no backsliding on the part of transitional
officials as Romania moves from revolution to democracy,'' Boucher
said.
   In Tuesday's statement Ms. Tutwiler credited the government with
taking ``significant strides'' toward democracy and respect for
human rights.
   She said, however, that many of the groups opposed to the
government apparently fear it ``is intent on stealing the
revolution from the democratic forces which ousted Ceausescu in
order to perpetuate communism in Romania.''
   While the Bucharest government has postponed the elections from
April to May in deference to these concerns, ``opposition parties
continue to argue that they do not have enough time to organize,
recruit candidates and publicize their programs and that they are
not being given sufficient air time on the government-controlled
media,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

   A Quaker organization said Tuesday that the
American penal system Quakers helped create 200 years ago is a
failure and announced that they have formed a commission to
reexamine the nation's criminal justice system.
   ``The compelling need in the United States is for transformation
of our priorities,'' said Stephen G. Cary, chairman of the board of
the American Friends Service Committee. Cary called for ``a new
awareness that the strength of a nation does not lie in might but
in education and jobs and homes and medical care for all its
people.''
   Cary said that when Quakers helped create the first penitentiary
system, they had hoped for ``a rehabilitative, rather than a
punitive, focus.''
   The new National Commission on Crime and Justice is composed of
black, Hispanic, American Indian and Asian-American experts and
community activists from around the country.
   Throughout the year, the commission will organize a series of
hearings and public education tours of prison facilities across the
nation under a program called ``200 Years Of The Penitentiary
Project.''
   By 1990, one million men and women will be held in U.S. prisons
and jails, according to the committee, which released statistics
saying 46 percent of state prisoners in 1984 were black and 10
percent were Hispanic.

   Five small earthquakes struck the
desert in Southern California within two hours Tuesday morning,
seismologists reported.
   None of the quakes registered higher than 2.9 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, said Hall Daily of the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena.
   The epicenter was 25 miles north of El Centro, near the Salton
Sea, Daily said. El Centro is about 175 miles southeast of Los
Angeles.
   The quake times and Richter readings were as follows: 6:01 a.m.,
2.8; 6:02 a.m., 2.8; 6:04 a.m., 2.9; 6:16 a.m., 2.7; 7:54 a.m., 2.5.
   Daily said lab seismologists reported similar waves of small
quakes have struck the region before. He said the temblors occurred
in the Brawley seismic zone, a complex web of faults.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded
on a seismograph.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

   ``I need a date for next Monday night,'' she told Joan Rivers
during a taping of ``The Joan Rivers Show'' to be aired Feb. 1.
``Do you know anyone?''
   Her ideal man is ``6 feet 2, 185 pounds about, sandy hair,
rugged outdoorsman _ someone who likes to ride, fish, hunt ... with
a certain amount of pride and stability,'' Sullivan said.
   The anchorwoman of ``CBS This Morning'' said of her current

what time is it?'' and described as ``hard'' the breakup of her
marriage.
   Her husband, she said, ``is a very good friend. The saddest
thing was that he couldn't move to New York or wouldn't move to New

share his. So it became a fait accompli.''

<HEAD>US Angry with UN Chief over Rights Situation in Cuba</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials expressed anger
Tuesday with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar for
what they said was his reneging on a promise to issue a report on
human rights in Cuba.
   But Perez de Cuellar's spokesman said that he had made no such
commitment and that the U.S. officials with whom he spoke had
misunderstood him.
   The State Department said U.S. officials had asked Perez de
Cuellar to make a report on his assessment of the rights situation
in Cuba after he had indicated he would prepare such a report if
asked to do so by one or more U.N. members.
   Other U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said that
Perez de Cuellar had made the commitment to Vice President Dan
Quayle, among others. They said Secretary of State James A. Baker
III is expected to send a letter to Perez de Cuellar setting forth
the U.S. position.
   The Bush administration has been eager to highlight what it
regards as the abuse by Cuban authorities of Cubans who testified
before a six-member U.N. rights group that visited the country on a
fact-finding mission in 1988.
   The State Department maintained than Cuban persecution of these
and other human rights activists ``warrants urgent action by the
commission.''
   Asked about the Bush administration's irritation over the issue,
U.N. spokesman Francois Guiliani said Perez de Cuellar had told
Quayle in December that any member of the commission could bring
the topic up for discussion.
   Perez de Cuellar would issue a report if asked to do so by the
commission but had not promised Quayle he would take such a step at
the request of a single member, Guiliani said.
   He also said Perez de Cuellar's position was based on the
commission's rejection of an amendment at the 1989 session asking
him to issue a report on the rights situation in Cuba.
   An official at the Cuban diplomatic mission here, insisting on
anonymity, said it was possible that some Cubans who testified
before the commission are now being detained. But he said the
detentions were for violations of Cuban law and were not connected
to their testimony to the commission.

<TEXT>
   A former federal housing administrator told a
Senate panel Tuesday that there is a critical need for a new
goverment program providing more housing for low-income people.
   Philip N. Brownstein, a Washington lawyer and former Federal
Housing Administration commissioner, testified before a Senate
Banking Committee subcommittee investigating the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. Brownstein, on a panel of former
federal housing officials who testified, served under presidents
John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
   Brownstein said that while housing programs may vary in the ways
they fund or encourage development of housing for low-income
people, any program will be costly.
   ``For all intents and purposes, all housing programs responding
to lower income needs have been terminated,'' he said.
   Without more construction, he said, the homeless will grow and
``its human and economic cost will dwarf any price tag attached to
federal housing efforts.''
   ``It is critical today that some program be instituted and
funded which will result in new units being put in place by means
of new construction or substantial rehabilitation,'' he said.

<HEAD>1985 Farm Law Will Help Eliminate Soil Erosion: Conservation Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Historic provisions in 1985 farm law will help
farmers move rapidly toward the elimination of severe soil erosion
on much of the nation's cropland by the mid-1990s, a private
conservation group said Tuesday.
   A study of more than 1,000 farms in selected areas across the
nation showed that the conservation provisions of the 1985 Food
Security Act have been a main force in prodding and luring farmers
into protecting soil and water resources.
   The report, released here by the Soil and Water Conservation
Society of Ankeny, Iowa, focused on the 1985 law's provisions
governing the use of fragile, highly erodible land, and wetland
areas.
   Specific deadlines were set for farmers to comply with
Agriculture Department regulations for conservation planning and
project completion.
   The law also established a 10-year Conservation Reserve Program
with a goal of removing 40 million to 45 million acres of highly
erodible cropland from production by the end of this year. About 34
million acres have been signed.
   Under the program, farmers must plant the idled land in
protective grass or trees. In return, they get federal cost-sharing
payments to establish the soil cover, plus annual rental payments
for 10 years. Those average about $50 per acre annually.
   ``For the first time in history, receipt of most federal farm
program benefits _ commodity price supports, agricultural credit
and crop insurance _ became legally contingent on the application
of appropriate land stewardship practices by agricultural
producers,'' the report said.
   The law's four conservation parts outlined the Conservation
Reserve Program, or CRP, and so-called sodbuster, swampbuster and
compliance provisions that the report said have been generally well
accepted by farmers.
   ``We may well accomplish a greater measure of erosion control on
the nation's cropland in the next five years than we have
accomplished in the preceding 50,'' said project director Max
Schnepf.
   ``But this report makes it clear that a great deal remains to be
done by farmers and by the federal government if we are to realize
the full potential of the 1985 farm bill's conservation
provisions,'' he said.
   Schnepf said the project began in mid-1988 and that the report
is the first of several planned for a three-year evaluation.
   Norman A. Berg, a member of the society's steering committee and
former head of the Soil Conservation Service in USDA, said the 1985
farm law for the first time linked farm policies and program
benefits to sound conservation practices.
   ``The law provided leverage we did not have before to curb
erosion and protect wetlands,'' Berg said.
   Society officials said the study, which had financial support
from the Joyce Foundation of Chicago, was ``by no means a
statistically valid survey'' of all U.S. land. However, the project
did entail a close look at conservation work in 22 representative
counties.
   The report said:
   _Conservation Reserve Program field checks show that soil
erosion will be reduced 91 percent on land enrolled in the program,
although the total tonnage of soil saved may be lower than USDA has
reported.
   _Sodbuster and swampbuster provisions, with the potential loss
of federal benefits, appear ``to be discouraging farmers from
improperly cultivating fragile land and converting wetlands to crop
production.'' However, there have been violations, and ``USDA
officials are not adequately monitoring or enforcing the policies
in some areas.''
   _Conservation compliance, which requires farmers to adopt and
carry out conservation plans will result in significant reductions
in erosion if the plans are implemented. But final implementation
``will be difficult for a significant number'' of farmers unless
they adopt adopt additional, low-cost erosion-control practices.

   EAST GERMANY _ East Germany's Communist Party endorsed for the
first time eventual reunification with West Germany as it sought to
improve its standing before elections in March.
   Ousted leader Erich Honecker was freed from prison and put in a
nursing home after a court, rejecting government demands he be

   BULGARIA _ The Communist Party opened a crucial congress
expected to result in a showdown between reformers and hard-liners.
Party chief Petar Mladenov fiercely attacked the ousted leadership
in the opening speech, but he offered few ideas for change.
   Mladenov refused opposition demands to delay elections that are
scheduled in May. He proposed splitting the post of party chief and
state president.

shoot at pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Col. Corneliu Pircalabescu testified that the defense chief,
Vasie Milea, shot himself in the heart because he could not bring
himself to order unarmed protesters to be killed.
   The provisional government issued a draft of its proposed voting
law for May elections, guaranteeing free direct elections for
Parliament and president as well as access to the media, a key
opposition demand.
   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Schifter and Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State Paula Dobriansky arrived to assess the

   A judge who illegally released a reputed
leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel has been sentenced to six
years in prison for obstruction of justice, a federal court said
Tuesday.
   Fabio Pastrana Hoyos was fired from his post as a customs judge
in the Caribbean coastal city of Cartagena after his 1986 order
freeing Jorge Luis Ochoa Vasquez, considered the second in command
of the drug trafficking cartel.
   Pastrana was found guilty Monday of obstruction of justice and
sentenced by the federal court in Cartagena, the court's clerk said
in a news release.
   In 1986, Ochoa was arrested in Spain on charges of shipping 127
fighting bulls to Colombia.
   The United States asked for his extradition on drug trafficking
charges, and Colombia asked for his extradition on the contraband
charge.
   Spain opted to send Ochoa to Colombia, where authorities also
had a U.S. request for his extradition.
   On Aug. 17, 1986, without ever having Ochoa brought before him,
the customs judge sentenced Ochoa to 28 months in prison for
illegally bringing the bulls into Colombia.
   He then suspended the sentence, released Ochoa immediately and
put him on probation.
   Pastrana claimed that he released Ochoa because the Justice
Ministry had not told him Ochoa was wanted for extradition. But an
investigation showed the judge had been notified to keep Ochoa in
custody for the extradition request.
   Ochoa was arrested again Nov. 20, 1987, but again a judge set
him free. That judge, Andres Enrique Montanez, of a federal court
in Bogota, also was fired. Montanez was never charged with a crime
in releasing Ochoa.
   No major trafficking suspect has ever been convicted and served
a prison sentence in Colombia, presumably because drug traffickers
either bribe or threaten judges to release them.
   Five judges have been killed by traffickers since the government
started cracking down on the traffickers Aug. 18.
   In the last five months, 13 middle-level trafficking suspects
have been extradited to the United States. One Medellin cartel
leader, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, was killed in a shootout with
authorities.

   Israeli leaders on Tuesday denied the
government has urged Soviet Jews to settle in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians are fighting for their own
state.
   The comments followed protests from the United States, the
Soviet Union and Arab leaders, who said establishing settlements in
the territories could hurt chances for peace.
   Yossi Ben-Aharon, head of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
office, said, ``Anyone who comes to Israel can go wherever he
chooses.''
   He said only a few hundred immigrants out of a total of 12,000
last year chose to live in the territories, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in 1967.
   The Soviet Union and United States criticized Shamir's statement
earlier this month suggesting Israel has to retain the occupied
territories to settle Soviet immigrants.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned any
plan to endanger ``Soviet emigres by using them to crowd
Palestinians out of their own land'' and suggested such settlements
could undercut Moscow's plans to further liberalize emigration laws.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said that ``the Soviet message was
not expressed very politely, and we are sorry about it, especially
because it is based on misunderstanding over the positions of the
Israeli government.''
   He added: ``Nobody is sending people to this or the other
place.''
   Israel's top diplomat in Moscow, Arye Levin, told reporters he
did not believe the Soviets were threatening to curtail
immigration. He flew to Israel on Tuesday for what he described as
a ``family visit.''
   Another Shamir aide, Avi Pazner, suggested that the Soviets were
trying to allay fears of Palestinians and Arab leaders.
   ``The Arabs are exerting heavy pressure on the Russians
concerning immigration, and Mr. Shamir expressed his hope that the
artificial storm would pass,'' Pazner said.
   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher was quoted by
the Jerusalem Post as telling reporters in Washington on Monday
that ``putting even more settlers into the territories is an
obstacle to the cause of peace.''
   The Arab League's representative in Washington on Tuesday said
U.S. comments on the issue have not gone far enough. Ambassador
Clovis Maksoud told a news conference that Washington should
reassess its policy against settlement of Soviet Jews in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Jordan's prime minister, Mudar Badran, said Arab countries were
discussing sending a delegation to the Soviet Union and other East
bloc countries to discuss the situation. He said continued
immigration ``will create instability and tension in the region.''
   ``We have good contacts and friendly relations with many Eastern
bloc countries and soon an Arab delegation will move to brief those
countries on the dangers of this issue,'' Badran said.
   He spoke to reporters at the end of a two-day visit by Syrian
Premier Mahmmoud Al-Zouebi. Both men said they would welcome an
emergency Arab summit to discuss the issue.
   Six left-wing parties have filed no-confidence motions in the
Knesset, or Parliament, over Shamir's remarks this month.
   Israeli legislators and Soviet Jewish activists in Israel have
accused Shamir of endangering Jewish immigration at a time of
growing concern about anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union.
   Yitzhak Abrahmson, head of a Soviet immigrants' group, said on
Israel radio he was worried that Shamir's statement could lead to a
Soviet clampdown on exit visas.
   The Jerusalem Post daily reported Tuesday that Georgi
Martirosov, head of the Soviet diplomatic mission in Israel, met
with Foreign Ministry officials over the issue and blamed Shamir
for the delay in ratifying an agreement to resume direct flights
between the two nations.
   Martirosov said Shamir's statements ``hindered any possibility
of moving this process forward,'' the Post said.
   Deputy Finance Minister Yossi Beilin told army radio that
officials from a six-member Soviet commercial delegation visiting
Israel also expressed ``uneasiness'' over Shamir's remarks and
``linked these things with the development of our ties with them.''
   Moscow broke diplomatic ties with Israel over the occupation of
the territories. It supports Palestinian demands for an independent
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and says restored ties with
Israel are conditional on progress in Middle East peace efforts.

   A Supreme Court justice Tuesday refused to bar
the television program ``Inside Edition'' from broadcasting scenes
filmed with a hidden camera inside a New York City doctor's office.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, without comment, rejected an emergency
request in which Dr. Stuart M. Berger's lawyers sought to block the
broadcast.
   An ``Inside Edition'' spokeswoman said the program plans to
include the scenes in a segment about Berger.
   A federal judge in Detroit ordered the program to keep the
secretly recorded scenes off the air, but a federal appeals court
panel overturned the judge's order as an unconstitutional ``prior
restraint'' of free speech.
   Berger, author of several widely sold diet books, is under
investigation by the New York State Department of Health's Office
of Professional Medical Conduct for alleged unethical and
fraudulent conduct.
   In its own investigation of Berger, the television program sent
one of its producers to the doctor's office as a patient. Producer
Amy Wasserstrom said in an affidavit she surreptitiously videotaped
two visits she made to the office.
   Ms. Wasserstrom said Berger diagnosed her as suffering from an
allergy to yeast and from chronic fatigue but another doctor told
her she had no such ailments.
   Berger's lawyers said airing the office scenes will do
irreparable harm to his reputation ``and the sanctity of his
office.''
   ``This case raises an important substantive issue dealing with
the right of an individual to be free from the publication of
information, and more specifically a videotape, illegally obtained
by the very same organization which now desires to broadcast it to
the 100 largest television audiences in the United States,''
Berger's lawyers said.
   U.S. District Judge Barbara K. Hackett in Detroit issued a
temporary restraining order Jan. 18, blocking broadcast of the
office scenes after finding they were filmed in violation of
federal anti-wiretape law and New York law.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati, however, unanimously ruled Monday that the restraining
order was unconstitutional.
   ``We are satisfied that the district court clearly erred in its
interpretation of First Amendment law,'' the appeals court panel
said.
   ``Any prior restraint bears a heavy presumption against its
constitutional validity,'' it said. ``Berger simply has not shown
the type of irreparable harm that can justify a prior restraint.''
   The syndicated television program is owned by King World
Productions Inc.
   The case is Berger vs. King World Productions, A-516.

   President Carlos Menem has
accepted the resignation of the State Intelligence Agency (SIDE)
chief Juan Bautista Yofre, government officials said Tuesday.
   Yofre, who announced his plans to resign last week, was expected
to be named to the Argentine delegation at InterAmerican
Development Bank headquarters in Washington.
   A journalist and former member of the Radical Civic Union
opposition party, Yofre joined Menem's election campaign in 1988
and served as the Peronist party candidate's press spokesman.
   The government announced this month the intelligence agency
would be restructured and sharply reduced in size as part of an
overall plan to cut public spending.
   Economy Minister Antonio Erman Gonzalez said 2,000 employees,
about 30 percent of the SIDE staff, would be dismissed.
   Government officials denied Yofre's resignation was related to
the weekend discovery of phone taps in Government House offices
used by Menem and in the official presidential residence.
   Security officials declined to say who was believed responsible
for the eavesdropping devices.

   President Bush has removed Mozambique from a
list of nations barred from receiving certain U.S. economic
benefits because of their adherence to Marxist-Leninist principles,
the State Department said Tuesday.
   ``The president made this decision based on Mozambique's move
away from the Soviet Bloc in socialism and towards the West,''
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   Among other actions, she said, Mozambique has:
   _Embarked on economic and political reforms that have included
establishment of a mixed economy no longer controlled by central
planning.
   _Joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and
is adhering to an IMF program that has abolished many state
enterprises and turned most land over to private farmers.
   _Officially abandoned Marxism at a 1988 party congress. Earlier
this month, President Joaquim Chissano unveiled a new constitution
that calls for direct election of the president and parliament and
stresses protection of individual rights.
   With its removal from the list of Marxist-Leninist states,
Mozambique is eligible to take part in a U.S. program under which
the government helps finance exports to foreign countries.
Mozambique has expressed interest in the purchase of U.S.-made
airliners under this program.

arrested after allegedly threatening his wife with a pistol, police
said.
   Strawberry was arrested at his Encino home early Friday and
spent a short time in jail, Sgt. Woody Baca said Monday.
   Los Angeles Police Cmdr. William Booth said Strawberry posted
$12,000 bail and is back with his wife, Lisa.
   ``It was very basic type stuff, a family dispute,'' Booth said.
   David Disco, a Los Angeles deputy district attorney, was to meet
with police to discuss the case for a decision on whether charges
will be filed.
   Two days before his arrest, Strawberry was involved in a
paternity case in Missouri, where blood tests established he was
the father of a child born in 1988 to a woman in St. Louis.
Strawberry did not contest the finding and a judge took under study
the amount of child support the All-Star outfielder must pay.
   Baca said police were called to the home after a report of
domestic violence. Mrs. Strawberry, 25, said she and her husband
had argued and that her 27-year-old husband slapped her in the face.
   Mrs. Strawberry then grabbed a metal rod and hit her husband in
the ribs and wrist, police said. Mrs. Strawberry told police
Strawberry got a handgun and threatened her.
   Police said Mrs. Strawberry showed no signs of injury but
Strawberry had bruises on the rib cage and wrist.

<HEAD>Space Partners Accuse U.S. of Acting in Bad Faith</HEAD>

   The United States' international partners in
the space station program Tuesday bitterly accused NASA of acting
in bad faith by excluding them last year when the station's
construction schedule was extended.
   ``Partners do not operate at arm's length, nor do they make
decisions unilaterally that will damage the interest of the other
partners,'' Reinhard Loosch of West Germany told a congressional
hearing.
   Loosch said he hoped the schism that developed was merely ``one
of the teething troubles'' of the partnership, called the most
advanced and costly international technological project ever
undertaken.
   ``The government of the Federal Republic of Germany cannot hide
its disappointment,'' said Loosch, West Germany's deputy assistant
director for international cooperation.
   In July, when it appeared Congress might cut $400 million from
the space station program, NASA planners secluded themselves at the
Langley Research Center in Virginia and worked out plans to cope
with the shortfall. The international partners were told in August
of the changes, mainly a one-year delay in completing construction.
   Congress, too, was kept in the dark.
   Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., who chaired Tuesday's hearing of his
House Committee on Science and Technology, said ``regrettably, this
committee learned of this exercise from media reports and was not
directly consulted.''
   The committee expressed its anger last year at a hearing to
which it summoned top NASA management.
   It turned out that NASA was denied only $200 million and some
design changes were restored.
   But Reimar Luest, director general of the European Space Agency,
said that in the revised plan ``only U.S. payloads were adequately
provided for. ... Anything related to ESA was left in the mists of
a new, second part of the program ... for which a detailed schedule
was not available.''
   He said the action violated international agreements ``and
offered no protections for ESA's major investment.''
   ESA, which represents 10 nations, is obligated to provide the
Columbus laboratory module, an unmanned free-flying polar platform
and another free flyer _ at an investment of about $3 billion.
   Japan signed on to provide an experiment module, also to be
permanently attached to the space station base, at a similar cost.
   ``If NASA's space station budget were cut, then the burden of
the cuts must be equitably shared among the partners, it should not
be shifted by NASA onto the other partners,'' Luest said.
   Learco Saporito, a senator in Italy's parliament, said that not
only the space station but also the credibility of the United
States as a partner was at stake.
   ``It concerns the very substance and basic foundation of the
international cooperation and of the entire project of the space
station,'' Saporito said. ``Such doubts may have negative
consequences in those countries, like Italy, which are your closest
allies.''
   Any major change in fundamental elements would present Japan
with ``great difficulties'' in continuing with the cooperative
program, said Akira Kubozono, executive director of Japan's
national space development agency.
   ``Suspicion of the Japanese public on the stability of the
international space station program could raise great difficulties
in continuing to secure political and financial support to this
program,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats on Tuesday proposed a
half-billion dollar aid package, $200 million more than President
Bush wants, to foster emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   The bill, introduced by Sen. Claiborne Pell, R-R.I. and the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, would augment $738
million in aid already approved for Poland and Hungary with $511
million targeted at Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria
and Yugoslavia.
   Pell said he would not be surprised if his proposal is increased
during the legislative process ``in view of the profound interest
of the United States in supporting positive developments in Eastern
Europe.''
   Bush, as part of the fiscal 1991 budget he proposed Monday,
asked for $300 million as a ``special assistance initiative'' for
countries behind the crumbling Iron Curtain, including Poland and
Hungary.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman told the House Budget
Committee Tuesday that the distribution of the $300 million, which
would need congressional approval, had not yet been determined.
   Pell's proposal includes liberalizing trade relations and
providing non-economic assistance, such as management training, to
the Soviet Union.
   It also would tell the administration to confer
most-favored-nation trade status on all of the Eastern European
countries at the earliest possible date, support their admission to
the International Monetary Fund and make them eligible for
Export-Import Bank loans and loan guarantees.
   In addition, the bill would provide $43 million to foster the
development of non-communist parties and free elections in the
Soviet bloc counties plus an immediate $80 million in food aid for
Romania.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind. and a senior member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said he applauded ``the idealism'' of Pell's
proposal but noted that the countries to which the aid was to be
expanded still are under heavy communist influence.
   Soviet troops remain; elections have not yet occurred, and
multiple layers of old communist bureaucracy remain, he noted.
   ``We have to be cautious,'' Lugar told reporters. ``Thus far we
are not in a position to send a lot of money into areas where the
people we are trying to assist may not be in a position to have a
whole lot of control over it.''
   Pell's bill devotes the bulk of the proposed aid, $250 million,
to capitalizing a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
with the intent of facilitating billions of dollars in private
investment across the East Bloc.
   Businessmen told the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday
they are not willing to make those investments unless Congress goes
beyond waiving and actually repeals the 1974 Jackson-Vanik and
other restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc
countries.

<HEAD>U.S. Military Advisers Try to Stop Reported Abuses by Liberians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials stepped in to
stop abuses of civilians by government troops tracking rebels, but
no U.S. officers have engaged in combat, a U.S. official said
Tuesday.
   Rebels of the National Patriotic Front invaded the Nimba County
region, which borders Ivory Coast, on Dec. 24 in a bid to oust
President Samuel Doe.
   Liberian authorities say the rebels killed about 200 people,
including 16 government officials, before government troops quelled
the attempt.
   Since then, the troops have been trying to chase down the
insurgents and Africa Watch, a U.S.-based human rights' group, has
accused the Liberian military of killing at least 200 civilians
during the search.
   Amnesty International has quoted refugees and other sources as
saying hundreds of civilians were killed by soldiers or rebels, and
the U.S. Embassy had expressed concern.
   In Washington Tuesday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said American military advisers have been working with the
Liberian military for a number of years.
   She said that following reports civilians were being harassed in
Nimba County, Doe sent a U.S. officer she identified only as Gen.
Craig to take charge of the forces there and instructed him to end
these abuses.
   Two American officers from the U.S. military mission in Liberia
accompanied Craig and other senior Defense Ministry officials to
assist them in ending abuses, she said.
   Mrs. Tutwiler said the U.S. officers were acting only as
advisers and not engaged in combat operations.
   The chief of staff of Liberia's armed forces, Lt. Gen. Henry
Dubar, said the U.S. officials went to Nimba County to ``assess the
situation.''
   Some of the more than 60,000 refugees who fled to the Ivory
Coast and Guinea to escape the fighting have accused the soldiers
of atrocities.
   The rebels also have been accused of killing civilians.
   Doe warned soldiers last week that they could face firing squads
if they harm civilians.
   He said the rebel force came from Ivory Coast and was led by
former civil servant Charles Taylor. He accused Ivory Coast of
aiding the insurgents, a charge denied by that nation.
   Taylor, a Liberian government official from 1980 to 1983, was
accused of embezzling nearly $1 million and fled to the United
States, where he was imprisoned pending extradition. He escaped in
1984.
   Doe came to power in a coup in April 1980 in which President
William Tolbert, a descendant of freed American slaves, and most of
Tolbert's political allies were killed. Doe has withstood several
coup attempts.
   Liberia was founded in 1847 by freed American slaves. It is the
biggest recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa and is the only
West African nation that routinely allows U.S. military planes to
refuel on its territory.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's decision to
cancel the tilt-rotor V-22 Osprey aircraft in the new military
budget leaves the nation's elite fighting forces ``struggling'' to
find an aircraft for high-risk, high-speed missions, their
commander said Tuesday.
   ``If the V-22 is finally canceled, I've got to have something
else,'' said Army Gen. James Lindsay, the four-star general in
charge of the Special Operations Command.
   ``I had my day in court more than once. ... I lost,'' said
Lindsay, whose specialized forces include the Green Berets and such
super-secret fighters as the Navy SEALS. Several thousand of his
forces were involved in the Panama invasion.
   For the second consecutive year, Cheney has proposed shutting
down the $27 billion program to produce the helicopter that can
also fly like a plane, arguing it is too expensive.
   Last year, Congress did not provide any money for procurement
but did approve some funds to continue research and development.
   The debate is only one of many that will erupt on Capitol Hill
over Cheney's fiscal 1991 spending plan, which has been criticized
by opponents as favoring big-ticket nuclear programs over other
weaponry.
   Lindsay refused to directly criticize Cheney's decision, saying
he was ``not an expert'' in budget matters and that Cheney ``is in
a very different position than I'm in. He has to make pretty tough
decisions.''
   ``That's right. When you lose, you lose,'' Cheney said in an
interview with wire service reporters when told of Lindsay's
remarks. ``The V-22 struck me as a lower priority item than other
of the things we need to fund. ... We can't afford everything we'd
like to have.
   But Lindsay argued that even if the V-22 is canceled, he will
still need a high-speed craft that can drop men into position and
return to pick them up, many times when no airfield is available.
   Lindsay cited the failed operation to rescue U.S. hostages in
Iran as a case where a fast-moving, refuelable transport plane
could be used on a long-range mission.
   The United States launched an airborne attempt in April 1980 to
free hostages being held in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, but the
mission was called off after one of the helicopters developed
engine trouble in a staging area in the Iranian desert. Eight
Americans were reported killed and several injured in the collision
of two planes in the subsequent withdrawal of the U.S. force.
   Lindsay said he'd lost to those who say his men can get by with
helicopters and the Fulton system that allows a flying C-130
transport plane to pluck men from the ground.
   ``I need something better than that, and I need something
reasonably fast,'' he said. ``And it can't be a helicopter. I need
more agility.''
   Lindsay said he did not have another vehicle to do the job, and
did not know where he was going to get one if the V-22 is canceled.
   ``At this point in time, we are struggling with it,'' he said,
adding that even the V-22 did not meet the speed or range
requirements he would like.
   Asked if he could name missions where the V-22 was absolutely
necessary, Lindsay said he couldn't cite a specific case.
   ``But I can tell you, I just know we're going to be faced with
situations, where if we can go deep and go fast and not be tied to
airfield, that is a distinct advantage,'' he said.

   The mayor proposed a student police corps to
augment the police presence downtown and provide young people with
part-time jobs.
   The goals are to ``create more connections'' between police and
youths and to set up a new recruiting device for the police
department, Mayor Don Fraser said Monday.
   Under the plan, to be made public in the mayor's State of the
City address late Tuesday, trained high school and college students
equipped with uniforms and radios, would be supervised by beat
officers.
   The students would not carry weapons. Fraser said they would
call for assistance if they witnessed crimes. He discounted any
threat to their safety.
   ``The likelihood is that they would always be in pairs, by
themselves or with officers,'' he said. ``The risks would be pretty
low.''
   Deputy Mayor Rip Rapson said many details have yet to be worked
out. ``It is a request from the mayor to the chief to develop the
idea and to assess whether it will work,'' he said.
   Such things as pay, insurance, ways to protect the young
people's safety and training still must be worked out, he said.
   Fraser said he wants the plan to take effect in 1991. It would
include active minority recruiting and be open to all students ages
17 to 22.
   ``We're always looking for opportunities to make the police
department a more attractive place of employment for minority
candidates and this is one way of doing that,'' Rapson said.
   Downtown business leaders have been pushing for more police
protection in response to a growing perception that the central
business district is becoming increasingly unsafe.
   ``There have been a number of incidents involving groups of kids
downtown, such as anti-social behavior, fights among kids,'' Rapson
said. ``We have had reported incidents of kids hassling shoppers
and there's even been one incident of a potential fight among gang
members that was broken up by police.''
   Police Chief John Laux's reaction, Rapson said, was ``positive,
but guarded.'' Laux was out of the office Tuesday and not available
for comment, his secretary said.
   Fraser said he expects the police officers' union, the
Minneapolis Police Federation, to endorse the plan. Lance Zentis,
head of the Police Federation, did not immediately return a call
Tuesday.

<HEAD>Barry Accuser Pleads to Misdemeanor, Testifies to Grand Jury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A District of Columbia employee, who law
enforcement sources say has accused Mayor Marion Barry of cocaine
involvement, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge Tuesday
then immediately began testifying before a grand jury investigating
Barry.
   James McWilliams testified for two hours after his plea, which
U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens called ``another significant step''
in the investigation.
   Barry, who was arrested Jan. 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine
possession charge, has denied under oath using drugs with convicted
cocaine dealer Charles Lewis at a downtown Washington hotel more
than a year earlier, in December 1988.
   The charge against McWilliams stemmed from allegations of visits
to Lewis' hotel room, some of which prosecutors say coincided with
Barry's visits.
   Meanwhile, Washington's WRC-TV, quoting unnamed sources, said
Barry could be indicted within two weeks by the grand jury, which
has been looking into allegations of perjury and cocaine possession.
   McWilliams, a city motor vehicles department employee and a
longtime Lewis associate, declined to comment either before or
after his grand jury testimony. He pleaded guilty to a charge of
aiding and abetting drug possession, which carries a maximum
penalty of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
   According to a source familiar with the case, McWilliams has
told authorities he was present once when the mayor and Lewis
disappeared into the bathroom of the hotel room for a short time.
   McWilliams told prosecutors he smelled crack cocaine and then
saw the mayor emerge from the bathroom under the influence of the
drug, the source said.
   McWilliams, 57, was called before the grand jury investigating
the case last January but refused to testify at that time.
   Carole Bland Jackson, a former business partner of the woman who
was in a hotel room when Barry was arrested this month in an FBI
sting, also said in weekend interviews that she was present when
Barry used cocaine at a 1986 party.
   The mayor is in Florida at a private facility being treated for
what aides say is primarily an alcohol abuse problem.
   Lewis pleaded guilty to cocaine conspiracy charges last November
in Washington and was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in
the Virgin Islands last spring.
   Lewis, who is cooperating with prosecutors, testified under oath
during his plea bargaining session in November that he had supplied
Barry with crack cocaine.
   In meetings with prosecutors in the past week, McWilliams also
said the mayor called him after Barry's ties to Lewis became public
and told him he trusted him to keep quiet about what he had seen in
the hotel room, two law enforcement sources said.
   Barry has said he only called McWilliams to urge him to
cooperate with authorities investigating the case.
   At a news conference, Stephens refused to say whether he intends
to question bodyguards assigned to the mayor on a round-the-clock
basis, but said prosecutors ``will want to cover any witness that
might be able to provide information regarding this case.''
   The prosecutor also said he would be comfortable showing jurors
a videotape of Barry and Rasheeda Moore in the hotel room before
and during Barry's arrest on Jan. 18.
   Stephens also denied the investigation of the mayor was racially
motivated, as NAACP President Benjamin Hooks and others have
suggested.
   ``Our job is to follow allegations ... diligently and
aggressively,'' Stephens said. ``We have done so without favor to
position, to race, politics or any other consideration.''
   He said Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, will be given both
original and enhanced copies of the tape next week.

<HEAD>Bennett Says Drug Warriors Have Already Won `A Victory Over
Confusion'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National drug policy coordinator William
Bennett said Tuesday that while the nation is a long way from
winning its war against drugs, it already has achieved ``a victory
over confusion'' about how to fight the battle.
   And that includes, he said, enough federal, state and local
financing for treatment programs to get ``very close'' to meeting
the medical and rehabilitation needs of drug abusers.
   Although some urban and community leaders have charged that the
Bush administration has seriously underfunded the treatment and
education components of its new, $10.2 billion anti-drug budget,
Bennett made clear his rejection of that notion.
   In fiscal 1991, he said, ``We will bring the treatment budget up
to $1.3 billion or $1.4 billion, which, when you combine the
treatment availability from all sources _ federal, state and local
_ will provide access for something like 1.7 million people to
receive treatment.
   ``We're getting very close to capacity _ to responding to the
full dimension of the treatment need,'' he said.
   In an address to the National Press Club, Bennett repeated his
declaration of last week that the nation is ``beginning to end''
the war on drugs.
   The best news for now, he said, is a political consensus on
strategy and the public's ``hardening attitude about drug abuse.
... We now have almmost the entire country becoming more intolerant
and more conservative on the issue.''
   Bennett noted that he will testify next week before the Senate
Judiciary Committee on drug strategy, and ``my guess is that some
members of that committee will try to argue fundamental
differences. In fact, fundamental differences among Democrats and
Republicans on major issues of drug strategy exist no more, though
there will always be small differences in emphasis.''
   ``And that's the thing. There's been a victory over confusion.
That much we surely have won. There's now a great consensus on the
various steps we can take.''
   He said that overall drug use in America ``went down from 1985
to 1988 by some 37 percent. So says the National Institute on Drug
Abuse.
   ``It's down in urban America, as well as rural America. It's
down in white America, as well as black America. It's down in rich
America, as well as poor America.''
   Still, he acknowledged, ``even as we've seen a decrease in
overall drug use, we've seen an increase in addictions. This will
be the case for a few more years. We will see the number of people
who are addicted keep rising.''
   ``There are great casualties,'' he said. ``Some large percentage
of a million drug addicts will be dead, or walking dead among use
for years to come.''

   The quality of last year's wheat crop was down

said Tuesday.
   Of the 13,363 samples checked by the department's Federal Grain

percent in 1988.
   Ratings by grade are based on a number of factors, including
test weight per bushel, damaged kernels, foreign material, and

   Police used batons, rubber
bullets and tear gas Tuesday to prevent 1,000 blacks from marching
on a stadium to protest a boycott-busting English cricket team's
match against a South African university team.
   The cricket team's tour has caused confrontations every place
the visiting cricketers have appeared, including their hotels,
where black employees refuse to serve them. The team is defying an
international ban on sports contact with South Africa.
   There also were demonstrations by black squatters in rising
political unrest only three days before President F.W. de Klerk is
to open Parliament. He is expected to discuss reforms in South
Africa and ease the emergency regulations in force since 1986 to
quell anti-apartheid activity.
   A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, predicted that de Klerk
would end news media restrictions but probably not ease other
regulations. It also said the release from prison of black
nationalist Nelson Mandela could be delayed because of the unrest.
   The stadium clash between police and blacks was at Bloemfontein,
in the Orange Free State.
   One policeman punched a black teen-ager in the chest with a
baton, another pressed his truncheon around a black youth's neck to
bring him down, as some demonstrators threw stones at police
vehicles and erected burning tire barricades in the streets of
Mangaung township.
   Obed Nkosi, an organizer for the anti-apartheid National Sports
Council, said 30 people were hurt.
   Police said 45 people were arrested and one white businessman
was slightly injured when his vehicle was stoned by protesters.
   An approved protest by about 500 people outside the stadium was
allowed to take place.
   Police also fired tear gas at 150 black squatters protesting
their eviction from Kraaifontein, a neighborhood designated for
whites outside Cape Town. The Rev. Allan Boesak, a prominent
anti-apartheid activist, was among those affected by the tear gas.
   Police in Cape Town urged the public to stay out of the city
center Wednesday and Friday ``because people are bound to get
hurt'' when action is taken to stop planned protest marches to
police headquarters and Parliament.
   The march organizers refuse to seek official permission, and
police Capt. Gys Boonzaaier said, ``The police are obliged to act
if the gathering is illegal. We are going to take action and
disperse them. ... We would like to urge the public to stay away
... as people are bound to get hurt.''
   Since de Klerk became president, the government has allowed
several massive marches to take place without the organizers
seeking permission. De Klerk was quoted as telling police
commanders two weeks ago that they are no longer ``required to
prevent people from gathering to gain support for their views.''
   But police officials say as long as there are regulations
against ``illegal gatherings'' _ those without magisterial
permission _ police must act to stop them.
   The stage is set for a major confrontation Friday, when black
activists hope to have 10,000 people marching toward Parliament as
de Klerk makes his speech outlining his plans for reforms leading
to negotiations with the black majority on a new constitution.
   ``There are firm indications that ... de Klerk will announce
some easing of the state of emergency in his opening address to
Parliament on Friday,'' said The Citizen, which has good government
sources. ``The first of the emergency regulations expected to be
lifted are those which were imposed on the media.''
   The paper said Mandela's release is not expected until
mid-February at the earliest. Reporters earlier in the week said
Mandela might not be freed until March.
   The emergency restrictions prohibit journalists from being at
the scene of political unrest, and from reporting anything about
it, or describing any police activity without permission.
Journalists are also banned from reporting a wide range of
statements that the government considers subversive, including
calls for boycotts, economic sanctions, and criticisms of the
military.
   The restrictions have not been uniformly enforced, but
photographers and television crews have been most affected. They
are often arrested and have their film confiscated.
   Also Tuesday, the Johannesburg city council declared the city's
business districts open to tradesmen of all races but expressed
regret it could not do the same for residential areas.
   The City Council of Pretoria also voted to open most municipal
facilities and the business districts, but pro-apartheid
Conservative Party members said they will try all legal means to
reverse the decision, government radio reported. The new policy
applies to buses, libraries, city hall and other buildings.
   Johannesburg, the nation's largest city, has already opened
municipal facilities such as toilets, libraries, public halls and
swimming pools to all races. Buses remain segregated in many areas
of the city.
   ``We are moving toward a discrimination-free city,'' said
Marietta Marx, a Johannesburg council member from the National
Party, which controls the national government and established the
policy of apartheid.
   ``But we still have the contorted logic, which is a black can
work anywhere but not live there,'' said Ian Davidson, a council
member of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party.
   City councils have no power to desegregate residential areas,
schools or hospitals, which are controlled by the national
government.

   Amnesty International said Tuesday that
the Iraqi army attacked dozens of villages in southern Iraq this
month and killed many civilians in an apparent attempt to capture
army deserters.
   Also Tuesday, an Iraqi Kurdish group claimed the Iraqi military
killed more than 60 fishermen this month.
   Iraq denied both reports.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights monitoring
group, said in a statement it received reports that ``large numbers
of people including unarmed civilians and army deserters were
killed or wounded'' in southern Iraq.
   The statement said the attacks targeted more than 30 towns and
villages in the predominantly Shiite Moslem region from Jan. 10 to
Jan. 23.
   Amnesty said it was not clear what prompted the military
attacks. But reports received by it ``suggest the attacks were
related to government attempts to capture hundreds of army
deserters.''
   An Iraqi rights group, the London-based Organization of Human
Rights in Iraq, said Friday that 10,000 people were killed or
wounded in an army crackdown in southern Iraq.
   It said tens of thousands were left homeless after the raids.
The group is recognized by the United Nations and coordinates its
work with Amnesty.
   A spokesman for the Iraqi ministry of information invited
journalists to visit the areas to investigate the reports.
   ``We invite any foreign reporter to come to Iraq and see for
himself the false and fabricated story of Amnesty International,''
the spokesman, who asked not to be identified, told The Associated
Press office in Baghdad.
   The marshes of southern Iraq were hiding places for army
deserters during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, but hundreds
surrendered to the army after the August 1988 cease-fire.
   Requests to visit the marshes in the past usually were rejected
by the ministry of information, which supervises the visits of
foreign correspondents throughout Iraq.
   Also Tuesday, a report by the London-based Kurdish Patriotic
Union said more than 60 Kurdish fishermen were killed this month
when Iraqi helicopter gunships attacked fishing boats on Lake Dukan
in northwestern Iraq.
   The victims were civilians who had no connection to the Kurdish
guerrillas fighting the government for autonomy, said the Kurdish
group's spokesman, who spoke to The AP in Nicosia, Cyprus, by
telephone. He refused to give his name.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified
Information Ministry spokesman as saying that the Kurdish report
``is slander and lies aimed at harming stability and security in
the Kurdistan area.''

   A murder trial linked to the mail-bomb slayings
of a federal judge and a lawyer was postponed Tuesday so doctors
can complete psychiatric tests on the defendant.
   Jury selection in the Superior Court trial of Emmanuel
Fitzgerald Hammond, 24, of Marietta was rescheduled for Feb. 19.
   Hammond, who is black, is charged with murdering Julie Love, 27,
a white Atlanta preschool fitness teacher who was abducted more
than a year before her body was found last summer. The prosecution
has said it will seek the death penalty upon conviction.
   A letter claiming responsibility for the December mail bomb
slayings cited Ms. Love's death and decried crimes by blacks
against whites.
   Bomb-sniffing dogs were taken through the Fulton County
Courthouse on Tuesday but found nothing, authorities said.
Spectators were screened with metal detectors, and extra deputies
searched purses and briefcases.
   The postponement came after Assistant District Attorney Richard
Hicks told Judge Ralph Hicks he could not properly impanel a jury
until defense attorney William A. Wehunt revealed whether he plans
an insanity defense.
   Wehunt said psychiatric tests on Hammond had not been completed
and that without results he could not determine Hammond's defense.
   The letter claiming responsibility for the bombs that killed
federal appeals Judge Robert Vance in Mountain Brook, Ala., and
attorney Robert Robinson in Savannah was signed by ``Americans for
a Competent Federal Judicial System.''
   The letter expressed rage over Ms. Love's slaying, saying it
demonstrated the writer's contention that the judicial system lets
black men get away with crimes against white women.
   Hammond and his 20-year-old cousin, William Porter of Union
City, were charged with the slaying.
   Porter pleaded guilty in November to felony murder, rape,
kidnapping and armed robbery. He has not been sentenced, and is
expected to testify against Hammond.
   Hammond, who police say was the triggerman, is charged with
murder, felony murder, kidnapping and armed robbery.

<TEXT>
   ``Coupon Connie'' claimed she clipped and traded
like any housewife, but a jury convicted her Tuesday on charges she
took part in a $2 million scheme to swap and redeem hundreds of
thousands of bogus coupons.
   Connie Arvidson, 34, of Boca Raton, Fla., was convicted on two
counts of mail fraud and one of conspiracy.
   ``She was the person knowingly buying and selling large numbers
of coupons,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Sucsy said Tuesday.
``Her statement to the effect she was only doing what any number of
innocent housewives were doing was not so.''
   The jury also convicted David Rees of Center Point of the only
charge against him _ a conspiracy count, said Maureen Ruprecht,
court coordinator for U.S. District Judge Sidney Fitzwater.
   A third defendant, printer James Floyd Richards of San Antonio,
was cleared of all three counts against him.
   Mrs. Arvidson, also known as the ``Dumpster Lady'' because she
would root through garbage bins looking for coupons, faces up to 15
years in prison and $750,000 in fines. Sentencing is scheduled
March 23.
   ``I've always felt that I was being made an example of, so the
prosecution ought to be happy,'' Mrs. Arvidson, 34, said after the
verdict, adding she will not continue with her coupon business.
   The defendants were accused of counterfeiting more than 600,000
copies of coupons issued by 47 companies, including Procter &amp;
Gamble, Nabisco Brands Inc. and Campbell Soup Co.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Arvidson bought the bogus coupons from San
Antonio counterfeiter David Rackmill. Rackmill, who faces five
years in prison for his role in the scam, pleaded guilty to mail
fraud and conspiracy and then acted as an informant.
   An indictment last June said that beginning in June 1988,
Rackmill obtained legitimate coupons and provided them to Rees
along with a payment. Rees in turn would give the coupons to
Richards for counterfeiting.
   Sucsy said Mrs. Arvidson used the coupons to buy the products,
then sold them at flea markets. But her main income came through
selling the coupons for more than she paid for them, he said.
   In opening arguments, Sucsy said Mrs. Arvidson also initially
placed orders for the counterfeit coupons directly with Rackmill,
but later became nervous and arranged for Rees to be middleman.
   Mrs. Arvidson's income from her coupon hobby was once estimated
at $40,000 a year. But her attorney said the coupon swapping
business only netted about $200 a week and she did not knowingly
sell counterfeit coupons.
   The counterfeit ring was uncovered after a four-month
investigation by the U.S. Postal Service. The defendants were
arraigned last August and the trial began on Jan. 8. The jury
deliberated for five days.
   Fitzwater ordered Mrs. Arvidson to post a $10,000 bond, while
Rees was freed on personal recognizance.
   Seven other people were indicted, all of whom agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for leniency.

<HEAD>Skinner to Allow Foreign Airline Expansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign airlines will be allowed to expand
service to more American cities in exchange for open markets for
U.S. carriers, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said
Tuesday.
   ``Deregulation of the U.S. airline industry is working well,''
Skinner said. ``Now it's time that we work to deregulate
international aviation markets.
   ``Let's push the dofree and unfettered
competition for air transportation around the world.''
   The Department of Transportation invited foreign airlines to
apply for the one-year, renewable authority to provide air service
between their home countries or wide open to and U.S. cities that don't
have such
service.
   Skinner said the decision would improve international service
and provide evidence of U.S. commitment to competitive
international aviation and ``willingness to try innovative ways to
encourage other countries to adopt our approach.''
   The new program is limited to cities where no U.S. or foreign
airline provides non-stop or one-stop single-plane service from the
foreign line's home country.
   To be eligible, an airline must come from a country that offers
U.S. airlines an open market to operate air service.

   New city councilors with an anti-tax,
anti-spending agenda shot into office, surprising even New
Hampshire residents used to independent rule with an attempt to
immediately overhaul the government.
   In a post-inauguration meeting Monday night, the council ordered
no increases in the 1990-91 budget, no new services and a city-wide
hiring freeze. It also canceled a grant application for money to
build a homeless shelter.
   Councilors proposed a charter change to take away the city
manager's sole authority to hire and fire department heads. Another
proposal would enable voters, not the council, to decide the city
tax rate.
   ``I did some housekeeping,'' said Thomas Tardif, the new mayor.
``Made some improvements, as I see it.''
   The so-called ``Straight Arrow'' slate of candidates caused a
stir in November by promising to oppose any budget proposals
calling for a tax increase in the town of 16,000, 20 miles north of
Concord. Voters elected a two-thirds majority to the council.
   New Hampshire is proud of independent local government. So why
the fuss?
   It appears the Arrows have gone too far too fast.
   ``It's a matter of `You didn't use my ball to play, now I`m
going to get even.' It's not a constructive council,'' said Armand
Bolduc, a former councilor. ``I hate to think the city will have to
put up with these clowns for two years.''
   He said he has never seen a council do away with everything
another council had done.
   Councilor Wesley Colby, not a Straight Arrow, was upset after
the meeting.
   Six of the seven Straight Arrows elected to the nine-person
council said they had met to discuss the plans before Monday night.
   ``They ran on an open-government platform _ I don't care if they
say they had no formal meeting or not, that thing was
orchestrated,'' said Colby. ``The arrogance of it all annoyed me.''
   But James Burke, city attorney, said the process of changing a
city charter is outlined in state statute, and is not a matter of
local law. There will be a public hearing Feb. 8 on the proposed
amendments. If there is an election scheduled after that, voters
will decide any changes, he said.

   Police and federal agents were checking the mail and private
deliveries to the church Tuesday morning.
   People near the independent charismatic church founded by Osteen
told police they heard a loud pop followed by screams.
   Ms. Osteen, director of ministries at the 10,000-member church,
was taken to Ben Taub Hospital, where she was listed in good
condition with burns and bruises to her mid-section and upper legs.
   Welch said he was not sure of the kind of bomb, but police
spokesman Sgt. J.C. Mosier said ``it was some sort of pipe bomb.''
   Officer R.C. Smith said the area of the explosion was very smoky
and powdery with an obvious odor of explosives.
   Smith said he was not certain of how the bomb was triggered.
   In December, nail-studded mail bombs killed a white federal
judge near Birmingham, Ala., and a black civil rights lawyer in
Savannah, Ga., in attacks investigators said were motivated by race.
   The Houston church is predominantly white.
   ``We have no idea what the motive is. We can't link this to
anything else,'' said Bob Switzer, special agent with the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said in response to questions about
a possible link to the bombings in Alabama and Georgia. ``There's
no indication. This is nothing more than a single incident.''
   Welch said he did not know of any threats against the Osteen
family.

<HEAD>Third `Captive' Flight Test for Pegasus Rocket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A NASA jet carried a
Pegasus air-launched rocket over the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday
during a dress rehearsal for the booster's first real launch in
March, officials said.
   ``I'm very happy. This was a very good day for the Pegasus
program,'' said Bob Lovell, vice president of Orbital Sciences
Corp., the Virginia company that developed the 49-foot-long rocket
in a private joint venture with Delaware-based Hercules Aerospace
Corp.
   The 41,000-pound rocket, designed to put small satellites in
orbit cheaply, was carried about 50 miles west of Morro Bay,
attached beneath the wings of the B-52 bomber, said Nancy Lovato,
spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   It was the third ``captive carry flight test'' for Pegasus,
which remains attached to the jet during such tests.
   ``This third flight lasted two hours and reached a maximum
altitude of 43,000 feet,'' Lt. Col. Ed Nicastri of the Pentagon's
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, said in a statement.
   Two attempts to launch the rocket were simulated during the test
flight, but the rocket _ which has a 22-foot-wide, delta-shaped
wing _ wasn't released, he added.
   The B-52 took off from this Mojave Desert military base at 8
a.m. PST and landed at 10:01 a.m. PST, Lovato said.
   During its first real launch, Pegasus is to place in orbit a
small Navy communications satellite, a NASA experiment and perhaps
a small satellite that Virginia will use for environmental
monitoring of Chesapeake Bay. During Tuesday's test, the rocket
carried full-scale models to simulate the Navy and NASA satellites.
   The Pentagon and NASA want to use the small rocket to launch
small military and science satellites, but Pegasus also is expected
to attract business from companies, foreign governments and
university scientists who need a cheap way to place payloads in
orbit.
   Lovell said the cost will be $6 million to $8 million per
launch, depending on how much business Pegasus gets.
   There were some brief losses of radio communication between the
jet's crew and ground controllers during Tuesday's test, but were
fixed quickly, Lovato said.
   ``We also had a launch lock light come on when it wasn't
supposed to,'' but the jet's crew knew through backup systems that
the rocket was still safely locked in place, Lovell said, adding,
``We need to get a better light bulb in there.''
   Skies were clear when the rocket-bearing jet took off from
Edwards Air Force Base, but weather was cloudy over the Pacific. So
the test ``demonstrates the validity of the (Pegasus) concept,
which is to take off over the desert where you almost always have
good weather and fly above the storms to carry out a successful
launch,'' Lovell said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ambitious, for-profit laboratory for new
American musicals was announced Tuesday to produce 16 shows in four
years using the talents of Harold Prince, Terrence McNally, Jimmy
Webb, Erica Jong, Marsha Norman and Marvin Hamlisch.
   The organization, New Musicals, will present the shows in a
theater complex at the State University of New York in Purchase, 25
miles north of New York City.
   ``This partnership refuses to accept the current depressed state
of the American musical theater,'' said Martin J. Bell, producing
director of the group.
   ``All the problems come from one source _ the cost of
production,'' he said. He said New Musicals has agreements with
Actors Equity, the Dramatists Guild and the Society of Stage
Directors and Choreographers which will enable it to lower
production costs.
   The budget will be $10 million for the group's initial season of
four shows, added Bell. Among New Musicals' other partners are
Capital Cities-ABC Inc., which owns ABC television; Columbia
Artists Management Inc., the classical concert management agency,
and Jujamcyn Theaters, which owns and operates five Broadway
theaters.
   Its first production will be a musical version of ``Kiss of the
Spider Woman,'' directed by Prince, with a book by McNally and
music and lyrics by John Kander and Fred Ebb. The show will star
John Rubinstein and Kevin Gray and will play at Purchase on May 1
through June 10.
   Bell said ``Spider Woman'' will be followed by ``The Secret
Garden,'' based on the classic children's novel by Frances Hodgson
Burnett. The book and lyrics are by Norman, author of ``'night,
Mother,'' and the music by Lucy Simon. It runs Oct. 23 through Dec.
23.
   The third offering is ``My Favorite Year,'' based on the movie
which starred Peter O'Toole. The music and lyrics are by Stephen
Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens. The run will be Jan. 8 through Feb. 16,
1991.
   The first season ends with ``Fanny Hackabout Jones,'' based on
Ms. Jong's novel ``Fanny.'' Ms. Jong will adapt her own book. Music
will be by Simon and lyrics by Susan Birkenhead. Its engagement
will be March 19-May 19, 1991.
   Eventual Broadway productions of these shows are possible, but
New York is not the only option, said Bell. ``We have an agreement
with the National Alliance of Musical Theaters, which is a group of
70 theaters all over the nation, to present some shows.'' And there
could be international agreements for productions of the musicals
or the possibility of shared productions in non-profit theaters, he
added.
   Among projects under consideration for future seasons, according
to Bell, are a contemporary musical version of ``Pinocchio'' by
Jimmy Webb; a musical about Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt by
Gretchen Cryer and Nancy Ford and an unspecified work from Hamlisch.

<HEAD>Resistance Says Iran Tries to Whitewash Human Rights Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian resistance officials accused the
Iranian government Tuesday of trying to conceal human rights abuses
and impeding U.N. officials who conducted an investigation last
week.
   ``What they saw was only the tip of the iceberg, but it was
enough to show them what was really going on,'' said Aladdin
Touran, spokesman for the People's Mujahedeen of Iran.
   It was the first outside rights investigation in Iran since the
1979 Islamic revolution, and it came amid efforts by Iran's
so-called moderate leaders to liberalize society and renew ties
with the West.
   The investigators now are in Geneva, where they will present a
report to a meeting being held by the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   Touran told a news conference at the United Nations that the
investigators visited only one of Iran's 653 prisons _ Evin Prison
in Tehran _ and only were allowed to see a workshop.
   Touran said his group had presented the investigators with
voluminous documentation of widespread rights abuses, including
2,000 written statements by alleged torture victims, and a list of
4,725 political prisoners, 1,786 torturers, 653 prisons and 30 mass
grave sites.
   The Tehran government denies all allegations of rights abuse.
   Touran said the U.N. officials met in Tehran with some families
of abuse victims.
   He said authorities beat and harassed the families of victims
who held a demonstration and would let investigators talk with the
protesters.
   ``There was a whitewash,'' Touran said, ``but the very fact that
the visit took place represents a victory for the Iranian people,
for the mujahedeen and for the international pressure that was
brought to bear on the Iranian regime.''

<HEAD>Schlesinger Proposes 200,000-Troop Cut in European Forces</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger
called on the Bush administration Tuesday to respond to dramatic
changes in the East Bloc and plan a drastic cut of nearly 200,000
in U.S. forces in Europe.
   Schlesinger, who ran the Pentagon under President Carter from
1973 to 1975, acknowledged in testimony before the Senate Armed
Services Committee that for years he had opposed reductions in U.S.
forces attached to NATO.
   ``Given this background,'' he said, ``I believe a certain weight
can be attached to the following recommendation:
   ``We should plan now radically to scale back our forces in
Europe. The time for that planning is now.''
   Under questioning, Schlesinger said the U.S. force in Europe
should number 75,000 to 100,000, down from the current 305,000
troops.
   Last May, before the drive for democracy hit high gear in many
Warsaw Pact nations, President Bush proposed a ceiling of 275,000
on U.S. and Soviet ground and air force personnel. That would
require a reduction of about 30,000 U.S. troops and about 325,000
Soviet troops.
   But Schlesinger said if the United States sticks to its current
position on manpower reductions it may fall into a trap of
``legitimatizing the long-term presence of Soviet forces in Eastern
Europe that might otherwise be withdrawn. ...''
   The appearance by Schlesinger before the Senate Armed Services
panel is part of a series of hearings the committee is holding on
how the United States should respond to the lessening Soviet threat
and its effects on the military budget.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee accused the Bush administration Tuesday of putting ``a
political gun to the head'' of lawmakers with a partisan list of
military base closings.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
list of more than 72 domestic facilities and 14 overseas
installations that would be closed or scaled back had
``potential.'' But he objected strongly to the way the
administration wants Congress to deal with the list.
   ``This is merely a list of candidates for closure,'' Aspin told
reporters at a news conference. ``The upshot is that the list can
be changed. Bases can be deleted or perhaps added. That creates
hostages for the administration. Vote against a veto override, your
base is safe. Vote to override, your base is threatened.
   ``The process is dead,'' Aspin said of the administration
approach, and he introduced legislation that would create a
bipartisan commission to make new base-closing recommendations.
   Cheney, in an interview with news service reporters, disputed
Aspin's assertion that his ideas were dead or amounted to political
blackmail.
   ``The idea I'm putting a gun to their head is not a valid one,''
Cheney said.
   The secretary said that because his list is not final, changes
could be made in it. Cheney he said he wouldn't rule out the idea
of a blue-ribbon panel and said he had made his suggestions because
it takes a long time to study such closures.
   Aspin's suggested panel _ similar to a commission created by
Congress in 1988 _ would produce an all-or-nothing list of closings
for approval or rejection by the defense secretary and Congress.
The recommendations of the 1988 panel to close 86 bases were
adopted by Congress last year.
   Cheney, in presenting his $292.1 billion military spending plan
for fiscal 1991, proposed on Monday a list of bases for closing or
realignment that would be considered by lawmakers on an individual
basis.
   ``This puts a political gun to the head of a member with a base
in his or her district,'' Aspin said.
   The lawmaker contended Cheney's process ``opens an enormous
bargaining bazaar.'' Aspin cited, as an example, the recent House
and Senate votes on President Bush's veto of legislation dealing
with extending visas for Chinese stuents in the United States.
   ``If you've got a list of potential bases to be closed and the
vote comes up on say, overriding the veto on the China thing, what
you've done is create an awful lot of bargaining chips for the
administration when it goes into negotiating with congressmen and
senators on how their going to vote on the veto override,'' he said.
   Questioned whether that was Cheney's intention in proposing the
bases for closing, Aspin said: ``You have to ask Mr. Cheney.''
   The Wisconsin Democrat also said the defense secretary's list
clearly is political with 22 of 32 domestic bases slated for
closing in Democratic districts.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a senior member of the House
Armed Services Committee, said Cheney has ``produced an unbalanced,
partisan hit list,'' of base closings. She said, ``Such an
unbalanced package is just plain unacceptable.''
   However, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., declined to
accuse the Bush administration of playing politics in its choice of
bases, and said, with a grin, ``I've heard some Republicans are
very angry'' with the selections.
   The speaker did say the decisions must be based on ``strategic
needs of the country,'' not ``political considerations.''
   Cheney, in the interview, also took issue with the charge that
his closure list was partisan.
   He said a large number of bases were in Democratic districts
because there are more Democrats in Congress and because a large
number of military installations are in Democratic-controlled
states.
   ``California gets about a third of the defense budget. ... Texas
has a large number of bases. It's really not political,'' he said.
   ``That's a petty kind of game that I don't think serves
anybody's interest. I didn't sign on as secretary of defense to get
Democrats. If I'd wanted to do that I'd have stayed in the House,''
he said.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., released a brief telegram
he sent to Cheney on Jan. 23, urging him to close Camp Parks, a
reserve military base in the congressman's district.
   Cheney had said Monday that not one member of Congress contacted
him about the base closings and suggested that their installation
be closed.
   ``To paraphrase Henny Youngman's famous line: `Take my base,
please,''' Stark said. ``Mr. Secretary, I am a member of Congress
and I do urge you to close Camp Parks.''

<HEAD>Prosecutors: Bank Taught Traffickers to Launder Money</HEAD>

   Ambitious bankers were so willing to hide
illegal drug money that they taught undercover agents how to do it,
a prosecutor charged Tuesday as trial opened in a $32 million
international money-laundering case.
   But a defense attorney said the government was trying to smear
the bankers by bringing up ties to deposed Panamanian dictator
Manuel Noriega.
   The bankers, officers with the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International, were all told up front about the source of the
money, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rubenstein.
   ``The bankers received essentially the same message. ... This
money comes from the illegal sale of narcotics in the United
States, specifically cocaine,'' he said.
   The bankers, he said, didn't care.
   ``It's not any business of mine who the customers are,'' he
quoted banker Amjad Awan as saying when told it was drug money.
   Awan, who once claimed to handle Noriega's secret accounts, is
on trial with four other former BCCI officers and a Colombian. They
are accused of conspiracy to traffic in drugs, conspiracy to
launder drug profits and various other counts of money laundering.
If convicted, each faces from 35 years to life sentences and fines
of at least $750,000.
   Defense attorney John P. Hume denied any wrongdoing on the part
of Awan and complained that the government was characterizing him
as Noriega's onetime personal banker.
   ``This is guilt by association. By focusing in on Panama and
General Noriega, they're causing you not to focus in on the
problems of the transactions,'' Hume told jurors.
   Hume said Awan was never told and had no idea he was dealing
with drug profits. The money came through a legitimate Florida bank
which the government said was cooperating in the sting
investigation.
   ``There's no evidence Awan knowingly engaged in transactions
described in the indictment,'' Hume said. ``Ask yourselves, it is
reasonable to do this for a promotion?''
   The other defendants are Rudolf Armbrect of Medellin, Colombia;
Syed Aftab Hussain, BCCI's operations officer of the bank in
Panama; Akbar A. Bilgrami of Miami, a director of the Latin
American Division; Sibte Hassan, who was an officer with the Paris
branch; and Ian Howard, French country manager based in Paris.
   Hussain's attorney likewise denied involvement, saying his
client was simply a junior officer in training, basically a
glorified teller who had no power to act on his own.
   In opening arguments, Rubenstein described how millions of
dollars in cash from drug sales were disguised in a series of
international banking transactions involving BCCI.
   Cash from drug sales was converted into certificates of deposit,
which were used first as collateral for loans, then to pay them off
as they matured, the government said.
   Robert Musella, a U.S. Customs agent posing as a high-stakes
launderer, met with Awan in Miami and stressed the need for
absolute confidentiality for his clients, the prosecutor said.
   ``My clients are the biggest drug dealers in Colombia,''
Rubenstein quoted Musella as saying.
   The trial is expected to last four to six months.
   Before the start of jury selection two weeks ago, guilty pleas
were entered by two divisions of BCCI.
   As part of a plea bargain, BCCI, one of the world's largest
private financial institutions, agreed to forfeit a record $14
million in assets frozen earlier by the government and to cooperate
against other defendants.
   The indictment resulted from a two-year sting operation,
eventually building a global laundering operation worth an
estimated $32 million, investigators said.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow in New England, Cold Wind in Minnesota</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm dumped as much as 28 inches of snow on New England on
Tuesday, and arctic cold dropped the temperature in International
Falls, Minn., by 46 degrees in less than 24 hours.
   By Tuesday afternoon, the day-long snowfall ended in much of
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, leaving snow accumulations of 1
to 2 feet in most of the region.
   Andover, Vt., got 28 inches, while 15 to 20 inches of snow was
reported along the eastern slopes of New Hampshire's White
Mountains, according to the National Weather Service. Mount Holly,
Vt., got 24 inches; Montpelier, Vt., got 20 inches; Nashua, N.H.,
16 inches; and Portland, Maine, 11 inches.
   Nine inches of snow fell at Houlton and Limestone, Maine.
Caribou, Maine, received 6 inches in six hours.
   Eastern New York state also got heavy snow from the storm, with
17 inches at Utica, Piseco Lake and Bolton Landing, and 11 inches
at Albany.
   Storm and snow advisories were posted across much of the
Northwest for Tuesday, and showers and thunderstorms extended from
the Gulf of Mexico across the central Gulf Coast region.
   In Northern California, a strong offshore gale whipped up
20-foot waves, and sunny skies alternated with dark, ``ominous''
skies and hail.
   ``It's pretty rough offshore north of San Francisco. It's
starting to pick up all the way north of there,'' said Coast Guard
Petty Officer Justin Wood.
   Most of the rest of the nation had dry weather.
   Strong northwest winds had ushered cold air into the north
central states Monday night, and temperatures remained below zero
Tuesday afternoon. The temperature at International Falls plunged
from a record warm reading of 35 degrees Monday afternoon to 11
degrees below zero Tuesday morning.
   Strong wind produced a wind-chill reading of 63 degrees below
zero at Cutbank, Mont.

<HEAD>Israeli Police Hold Firebomb Woman Headed for Jewish Holy Site</HEAD>

   Police on Tuesday arrested an 18-year-old
Palestinian woman carrying a firebomb and heading toward the
Western Wall, Judaism's most holy site.
   ``She was caught during a routine security check,'' Jerusalem
Police spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   He said the woman lived in Silwan, an Arab village inside
Jerusalem, and that the firebomb was ready for use. She was
apprehended at a checkpoint in the old, walled city leading to the
Western Wall, Sandori said.
   Israel radio said the woman has refused to tell police her
intended target.
   The Western Wall, also called the Wailing Wall, is the only
remnant of the Second Temple built by King Herod and destroyed by
the Romans in 70 A.D.
   Also on Tuesday, Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini spoke in
Hebrew to an audience of about 250 Jews in which he appealed for
peace talks.
   In Arabbuna, near Jenin on the West Bank, three Palestinians
were stabbed to death and at least 15 other villagers were injured
in a fight between rival families, Arab reports and the army said.
   The fight in the mountain hamlet of 1,000 inhabitants was
reportedly over a money loan.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city with 120,000 people,
Israeli troops sealed two homes, the army reported. The homes
belonged to Palestinian men suspected of having killed eight Arabs
as collaborators with Israel, .
   About 651 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians during the 25-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. An additional 174
Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaborating. Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence.
   Israel has occupied the lands since the 1967 Middle East war.
   Husseini, an activist who supports the Palestine Liberation
Organization, told his audience it was better Israelis and
Palestinians had ``a dialogue rather than a monologue.''
   Husseini, a native Arabic speaker, on several occasions turned
to the three Israelis on the panel for help with a Hebrew word, and
once the audience shouted one for him _ ``matarot,'' meaning
targets or goals.
   ``It has not been easy for us to say we don't want to continue
with the same (anti-Israeli) war, with the same targets of our
fathers,'' he said.
   Husseini appealed to Israel ``to talk to the Palestinian people
as a people, not as a minority, not as residents of some place, not
as refugees.''
   Husseini has made a series of appearances before Jewish
audiences to try to explain the Palestinian goal for an independent
state.
   As the audience gathered for the speech at Jerusalem's Van Leer
Institute, about 40 right-wing Israelis waved banners and shouted
slogans against Husseini. They included activists from the Kach
Party of American-born Rabbi Meir Kahane, who carried signs reading
``Deport Husseini Now'' and ``Arab Murderer Out.''
   Israel radio said a bomb threat was received before the talk but
police searched the building and no bomb was found.
   Army gunfire wounded at least seven Palestinians in clashes in
refugee camps in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, hospital officials said.
   Arab reporters said that in the Shabura camp in Rafah, soldiers
tried to arrest students singing nationalist songs on their way
home from school, that camp residents tried to stop them and that
at least three youths and a 30-year-old woman were shot with
plastic bullets.

   A government-sponsored study indicates that
high doses of fluoride may cause cancer in male rats, but public
health officials cautioned Tuesday that the findings are
preliminary.
   Officials also said the findings do not suggest that
tooth-decay-fighting fluoride in drinking water and toothpaste
could cause cancer in humans.
   ``The findings must be evaluated and given final scientific peer
review before conclusions can be drawn,'' said Jim Brown, a
spokesman for the Public Health Service. Such a meeting is
scheduled for April 26.
   ``It should be noted that all previous studies including those
by the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control,
the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute as well as studies
done in Canada, England, Australia, New Zealand and Norway show no
linkage between ingested fluoride and mortality from cancer in
humans,'' he said.
   In the study conducted by the National Toxicological Program,
1,360 mice and rats were fed water containing sodium fluoride. Four
male rats given high doses got bone cancer. None of the female
rats, nor any of the male or female mice in the study, was found to
have contracted cancer at any of the four doses given.
   The high doses contained fluoride in far greater amounts than
humans are exposed to in toothpaste and water, Brown said.

   Fifteen businesses went to state court
Tuesday to overturn the nation's toughest Sunday closing laws,
saying they are vague, selectively enforced and unconstitutional.
   ``You cannot discriminate among businesses, giving some special
privileges and not affording those to others, and we're saying that
this law does this,'' said John Olson, a Bismarck attorney
representing the businesses.
   The lawsuit filed in South Central District Court in Bismarck
follows unsuccessful attempts to persuade the state Legislature to
overhaul Sunday-closing laws, which have existed in some form since
statehood 100 years ago.
   ``It is evident from what is happening nationally and globally
that North Dakota's economy will not grow by restricting
business,'' said Dale Anderson, president of the Greater North
Dakota Association, the state's chamber of commerce, which is
backing the lawsuit.
   Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth said he personally favors
Sunday shopping, but that his own opinion will not prevent him from
defending the law.
   ``It's an important and difficult case, and our office will
defend the present law vigorously,'' Spaeth said in a statement.
   The law lists 44 items that may not legally be sold Sunday
except under some limited circumstances like rummage sales. The
list includes cameras, shoes, cars and trucks, lawnmowers, and
``clothing other than work gloves and infant supplies.''
   The law also lists 37 types of businesses that may open on
Sunday, including grocery and convenience stores. But it does not
include department stores, forcing North Dakota's shopping malls
and other retail outlets to close.
   West Acres Development, which owns North Dakota's largest
shopping mall is one of the 15 plantiffs in the lawsuit. The
company's controller, Brad Schlossman, said stores in the Fargo
mall are penalized because they must remain closed while other
stores selling similar items are open Sundays.
   ``That isn't fair,'' he said.
   Schlossman said the state would get an estimated $20 million in
tax revenue over a two-year period from Sunday sales.
   ``So if retailers win, the whole state wins,'' he added.
   North Dakota is one of eight states with some form of law
restricting Sunday sales, according to the National Retail
Merchants Association. Most of the other states restrict liquor
sales, while Louisiana restricts the sale of cars on Sundays.
   Olson, who is also a Republican state senator, said the North
Dakota law not only is discriminatory, but also is ``very, very
confusing.'' For example, he said, it is unclear whether the ban on
selling work gloves extends to winter gloves.
   ``When you have the clerk that's staffing the till at the
checkout line in the store, that person has to make those decisions
on the spot,'' Olson said.
   A clerk who illegally sells an item could be convicted of a
misdemeanor with a maxium penalty of 30 days in jail and a $500
fine, he said.
   The lawsuit also contends North Dakota's laws unfairly restrict
interstate commerce and inject religion into state lawmaking.
   No date for a hearing on the lawsuit has been set.
   The 15 businesses are in Fargo, Grand Forks, Wahpeton,
Jamestown, Bismarck and Minot, and include a Bismarck real estate
broker, a Jamestown car dealer and a Grand Forks hardware store.
   Olson unsuccessfully sponsored legislation last year to overhaul
North Dakota's blue laws.
   Sunday-closing laws have been challenged previously in North
Dakota courts, but recent decisions in other state courts and the
U.S. Supreme Court have added weight to the argument against them,
Olson said.
   ``We have a much better chance of prevailing in 1990 than we
would have 10 or 20 years ago,'' he said.

   More than 6,000 ethnic Albanians
chanting ``Democracy!'' clashed with riot police Tuesday in
Podujevo, and five people were reported killed as protests spread
across Kosovo province.
   Many companies stopped work on the seventh day of unrest in
Kosovo.
   The deaths brought to 13 the number of officially reported
deaths since clashes began Jan. 24 in the ethnically troubled
region.
   Radio Pristina reported the deaths of two ethnic Albanians in
Malisevo, a town 40 miles outside Pristina, and police sources
later reported a policeman was seriously wounded there in an ambush
by ethnic Albanians who fired at a passing column of police
vehicles.
   Belgrade televison reported that police shot and killed three
other ethnic Albanian demonstrators in two other small towns. The
reports could not be independently confirmed.
   The police sources also said local ethnic Albanian police
refused orders to intervene during a small demonstration at Goles,
10 miles northwest of the provincial capital _ the first such
instance of disobedience since the unrest began.
   The report could not be verified independently. The sources
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   About 30,000 people gathered in the town of Urosevac for the
funeral of one of those killed earlier.
   Demonstrators in several cities and towns defied government
demands that they end protest marches. Strikes were reported at
several factories in support of the protesters.
   In Podujevo, a city 20 miles north of Pristina, riot police
fired hundreds of tear gas rounds at the mostly young demonstrators
who covered their faces with scarves. There was no report on
casualties.
   The ethnic Albanians are demanding free elections, lifting of a
year-old state of emergency, release of political prisoners and an
end to political trials.
   Armed riot police, some in helicopters, used clubs and a water
cannon to battle stone-throwing demonstrators throughout the
province Monday night.
   Yugoslavia's collective state presidency and the government
issued separate statements Monday, both describing the Kosovo
situation as ``extremely grave.'' The statements promised
``resolute action'' to stop the demonstrators.
   Demonstrations also were reported in Orahovac, Kosovska Vitina
and several other towns in the province.
   The ethnic Albanians began rioting last year after the Serbian
republic, of which Kosovo is an autonomous province, made
constitutional changes to take tighter control of the region.
   Ethnic Albanians make up about 90 percent of the impoverished
southern province's population, and they are predominantly Moslem.
The minority Christian Serbs say Moslems in Kosovo want to force
them out and then join neighboring Albania.
   For the first time in Kosovo, Serbs and the ethnic Albanians
were reported confronting each other in Kosovska Vitina on Tuesday.
Riot police positioned themselves between the two angry groups,
which numbred hundreds on each side.
   Previously, such confrontations were avoided, but last week, an
organization of Kosovo Serbs demanded that the authorities
distribute weapons so they could protect themselves.
   A number of Serbian villages have organized vigilante patrols
armed with shotguns and pistols in what they say is an effort to
defend their homes.
   ``The situation has never been so bad in history,'' a gun-toting
Serb in the village of Donja Gusterica told reporters.
   In Belgrade, the federal capital and capital of Serbia,
thousands of students rallied late Tuesday in an anti-Albanian
demonstration.
   ``We shall give our lives, but not Kosovo!'' they chanted.
   Federal Deputy Premier Zivko Pregl and Interior Minister Gen.
Petar Gacanin met in Pristina on Tuesday to discuss the
deteriorating situation in the province with local Communist
authorities.

<HEAD>Father Says Washington `Stalled' While Factory Workers Died</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three times as many Americans die yearly from
industrial accidents in confined spaces as from commercial air
crashes, but the government has stalled on drafting rules to save
workers' lives, federal officials were told Tuesday.
   Relatives of five men who suffocated or were poisoned in three
chemical-tank accidents testified before a panel of U.S. Labor
Department officials about how the disasters might have been
averted if standards proposed years earlier had been in effect.
   ``Our government has failed us,'' said Phil Claypool, father of
one of the victims.
   His testimony came in the last of three public hearings on rules
proposed by the department's Occupational Safety and Health
Administration. Previous hearings were held late last year in
Washington and Houston.
   Stephen R. Jones, one of the four Labor Department officials on
the panel, said his agency hopes to finish drafting rules by the
end of the year.
   Three hundred workers die each year from suffocation, poisoning,
drowning and injuries in confined industrial spaces such as
refinery tanks, tunnels, sewers and grain elevators, according to a
1976 estimate by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health.
   In contrast, from 1980 to 1988, U.S. commercial air crashes
claimed an average of 105 people per year, according to figures
submitted at the hearing and attributed to the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   Denise Grad, 29, of suburban South Holland told the panel
Tuesday how her 32-year-old husband, Tony, was suffocated by
nitrogen in a tank car in May 1988 while working for a waste hauler
in Matteson, south of Chicago.
   ``When he looked ... to go in there, he had no idea it had been
cleaned out with nitrogen,'' said Mrs. Grad, choked by tears. ``He
was always very careful _ it was one thing he was noted for.''
   Mrs. Grad, who has a 2-year-old son, called for stricter
labeling to protect workers from unknowingly entering confined
spaces filled with potentially fatal gases, and for required rescue
procedures and equipment.
   Nitrogen, which comprises four-fifths of the atmosphere, can be
fatal if breathed in high concentrations, according to Dr. Stephen
Hessl, chairman of occupational medicine at Cook County Hospital.
   Mark DeMoss, 18, and Dennis Claypool, 21, also were suffocated
by nitrogen in December 1988 in a large tanker truck they'd been
told to clean in Rockdale, according to testimony.
   ``There were no markings on the truck to indicate that it had
recently contained nitrogen,'' said Joseph Kinney, director of the
National Safe Workplace Institute, a Chicago-based advocacy group.
   Written testimony from Claypool's father noted that a 1979 NIOSH
report proposed standards to prevent confined-space accidents.
   The government never adopted them.
   Also testifying were the mothers of two men who died in the
nation's worst confined-space industrial accident of 1988, in which
five men succumbed to hydrogen cyanide fumes in a metal-plating
tank in Auburn, Ind.
   The rules OSHA has proposed would require measurement of
chemical levels in confined spaces before workers enter, presence
of a standby worker to rescue any stricken employee and special
training of workers exposed to hazards in confined spaces.
   ``We see this as a real litmus test'' for the Bush
administration, said Diane Factor, an AFL-CIO industrial hygienist
who attended the hearing. ``If they can't do it on this one, it's a
pretty bad signal for what the rest of their plans are for the
agency.''

<TEXT>
   Group Capt. F.W. Winterbotham, who played a key
role in exploiting broken German codes in World War II and wrote
the bestselling memoir ``The Ultra Secret,'' has died, British news
reports said Tuesday. He was 92.
   He died peacefully at home on Sunday, the accounts said.
   Frederick William Winterbotham was a pilot in World War I, and
in 1929 was made head of aerial intelligence in MI6, the British
intelligence agency.
   In the 1930s he managed to befriend senior Nazi figures in
Germany and glean information about the Luftwaffe. In 1939 he
helped devise a vital new method of aerial reconnaissance
photography.
   But his most important work was with ``Enigma,'' the top-secret
German code system that the British had managed to penetrate.
   Winterbotham's job was to get the information from Enigma, or
``Ultra intelligence'' as it was known, to commanders in the field
without revealing to the Germans their code had been cracked. He
worked out a system that was successful throughout the war, and did
not become public knowledge until the 1970s.
   His work made him a confidant of wartime Prime Minister Winston
Churchill. But he remained an unsung war hero, because the cracking
of Enigma was considered so secret it was not revealed for 30 years
after the war, when Winterbotham published ``The Ultra Secret.''
   Winterbotham was married twice and had four children.

   The coast guard said Tuesday it believed it had
located the wreckage of a Greek-registered cargo ship that
disappeared during a storm and all 19 crew members were presumed
dead.
   Two bodies, one identified as a Greek crew member, washed ashore
on the south coast of England with a life boat bearing the ship's
name, Flag Theofano.
   The coast guard said 11 Greeks, seven Maldivians and one
Egyptian were on board when the vessel vanished in bad weather
Monday night.
   ``For those seamen left in the water there is no hope whatsoever
of them being found alive,'' said senior coast guard officer Bob
Woodwark.
   The coast guard said sonar readings found a sunken vessel five
miles south of Portsmouth, but stormy seas prevented divers from
positively identifying the wreckage as the 324-foot ship.
   ``We are quite certain there is definitely a ship down there;
what ship it is we don't know,'' said a rescue worker who flew over
the sight.
   The 1,184-ton vessel was last heard from Monday evening as it
approached its destination of Southampton carrying cement from Le
Havre, France. The coast guard said no emergency call was received.
   The weather was described as very poor in the channel Monday
night with high winds and rough seas. The captain was told to
anchor before entering Southampton because of the weather, the
coast guard said.
   Helicopters, life boats and shore search parties have combed the
area for survivors, the coast guard said, and a further search will
be resumed at dawn Wednesday.
   A spokesman for Lloyd's of London insurance said the ship was
built in 1970 and belongs to Seawave Compania Nanera, a Greek
company.
   The Flag Theofano was on a three-year charter to Blue Circle, a
building materials company.
   Blue Circle spokesman Ian McKenzie said their cement stocks are
high and there was no pressure on the ship to sail in the nasty
weather.
   ``The decision about making a voyage always rests with the
captain,'' McKenzie said.

   Rock legend Bob Dylan was named a commander in
France's Order of Arts and Letters on Tuesday, in a ceremony in a
gilded neoclassical reception room at the Palais Royal.
   Sporting a black Western outfit and a growth of grey stubble,
the 48-year-old signer and composer bowed his head to accept the
gold and emerald medal from Culture Minister Jack Lang.
   ``Thank you very much for presenting me with this honor,'' Dylan
said, reading in French from a crumpled envelope. ``It moves me
enormously.''
   Lang told Dylan that ``for many of us in France and in Europe
you bring together an ideal of music, an ideal of poetry.''
   The room at the Palais Royal was packed with photographers,
journalists and fans, many too young to remember Dylan's earliest
tunes in the 1960s when he first performed such classics as
``Blowin' in the Wind'' and ``Like a Rolling Stone.''
   Dylan is giving a series of concerts in Paris as part of a
European tour.

   CBS' Super Bowl game coverage won the weekly
Nielsen ratings by a big margin but was one of the lowest-rated
games ever and failed to boost CBS out of third place.
   The 39.0 rating for the telecast of San Francisco 49ers' 55-10
romp over the Denver Broncos was the lowest ever for a Super Bowl
in prime time and the lowest overall since 1969. It was the first
time since 1981 that the Super Bowl network failed to win the week.
   The Sunday game was seen by 63 percent of the television
audience for the week ended Jan. 28. It was seen in nearly 40
million homes by about 108.5 million people.
   Its nearest competitor in the ratings was the post-game show,
which had a rating of 25.3.
   The post-game show barely squeaked past NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
and ``Cheers,'' which tied for third with a rating of 25.0.
   The Super Bowl ratings did nothing, however, to lift CBS out of
third place. NBC was first and ABC was second.
   ABC's ``American Music Awards,'' in 10th place, was the only
other non-regular show in the Top 10.
   NBC was first for the week with an average of 15.0. ABC followed
with 13.2 and CBS with 12.8. A ratings point represents the
percentage of the nation's 92.1 million television homes tuned to a
show.
   For the season to date, NBC is ahead with 14.8, ABC second with
13.0 and CBS third with 12.3.
   Here are the Top 10: CBS' Super Bowl XXIV Game, CBS' Super Bowl
XXIV Post Game Show, NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' tied,
ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls,'' NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' and ABC's
``American Music Awards.''
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was the top evening news show for
the week. NBC was second. The ratings: ABC 12.0, NBC 11.1, CBS 10.3.
   The lowest rated show of the week was CBS' ``Super Bowl Saturday
Night.'' Here are the bottom five network shows: the CBS Tuesday
Movie ``So Proudly We Hail,'' ABC's ``Mission: Impossible,'' CBS'
``Paradise,'' ABC's ``Life Goes On'' and CBS' ``Super Bowl Saturday
Night.''

   A coalition of banished Haitian leaders
Tuesday urged the United States to join an international effort to
remove Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril from power through military and
economic sanctions.
   The group, saying it represents all Haitians silenced by Avril's
``regime of terror,'' rejected Avril's announcement Monday that he
was restoring civil and press liberties to the impoverished island
after a week-long crackdown against opposition activists.
   ``We believe that there is no possibility, under any
circumstances, to resume the democratic process with Prosper Avril.
Avril must go,'' the four leaders said in a statement issued after
a meeting with the Congressional Task Force on Haiti.
   Avril rose to power in a 1988 coup led by non-commissioned
officers who professed disgust with state terrorism under ousted
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   Avril promised elections for October, but critics say he has no
intention of fulfilling his promise, despite pressure from the
United States, France and other governments.
   The exiles accused the United States of propping up dictatorial
regimes in Haiti for more than 30 years under the pretext of
fighting communism in the Caribbean.
   ``We ask the United States now to pay attention to 6 million
Haitians,'' said Antoine Izmery, a prominent civic leader exiled
last week.
   Izmery said Avril had worked for the CIA and betrayed the United
States as did former Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``It's time for the United States to face its true
responsibilities,'' Izmery said.
   Louis Roy, an architect of Haiti's constitution who was
arrested, beaten and banished last week, said Haiti would not
condone a Panama-like invasion to remove Avril, but that other
steps could be effective.
   ``Pressure by the United States will succeed if it's strong
enough and accompanied by threats that they mean business,'' said
the 74-year-old leader.
   U.S. pressure, he said, helped end the harsh 27-year Duvalier
dynasty when President-for-life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile
in France in February 1986.
   Asked what kind of threats the United States should make, Roy
said military and economic but he did not elaborate.
   The United States has suspended all aid to the Haitian
government, although it provides humanitarian assistance to the
Haitian people through private organizations.

   Scientists got their first look at a
rescued science satellite Tuesday, and said they were delighted
with its condition despite some wear and tear from six years in
space.
   Wearing contamination-proof clothing and standing on an
observation platform several feet away, scientists watched as the
shuttle Columbia's 60-foot-long cargo bay doors opened to reveal
the Long Duration Exposure Facility.
   The opening of the doors was the first step toward removing the
11-ton LDEF with a large crane, placing it in an air-tight canister
and moving it from the shuttle processing facility to a sterilized
building several miles away for close examination. The work was
expected to last much of the night.
   Columbia's astronauts retrieved the laboratory 200 miles out in
space Jan. 12, snaring it just weeks before it was to drop into the
atmosphere and die a fiery death.
   LDEF project chief William H. Kinard trained binoculars on the
satellite Tuesday, and said it appeared to be a little more
weathered than pictures taken in space indicated.
   ``There are lots of small micrometeoroid craters,'' Kinard said.
He said there was some discoloration, and foil covering some
experiments had been torn.
   ``But that's why we sent it up there, to find out what happens
to materials after a long time in the space environment,'' Kinard
said. ``We're delighted with the condition.''
   There are 57 experiments attached to LDEF's exterior, and
scientists and engineers want to see how the various materials in
them fared during their long exposure to radiation, micrometeoroids
and other phenomena in space.
   The experiments will yield information that will be valuable in
designing future long-duration spacecraft, including the Freedom
manned space station to be assembled in orbit in the mid-1990s.
   Four teams will study the recovered laboratory for about three
weeks, photographing it and jotting down their observations. The
teams are composed of specialists in space debris, materials,
spacecraft systems and radiation.
   Starting in mid-February, the experiments will be covered with
protective aluminum and removed one by one from the satellite's
racks. They will be delivered to scientists throughout the nation
and Western Europe for detailed study.
   The satellite has 21 materials, coating and thermal systems
experiments, five power and propulsion experiments, 17 science
experiments and 14 optics and electronic experiments. They involve
more than 200 investigators from 33 companies, 21 universities,
seven National Aeronautics and Space Administration centers and
eight foreign countries.
   Also aboard are 12.5 million tomato seeds. A few will be planted
in research labs.
   However, most will be sent to schools where students in grades 5
through university level will plant, water and nurture the seeds to
research such things as germination rates and genetics.

   Baltic separatists say they have arranged
an unusual attempt to resolve bloody strife in the Caucasus because
that conflict could jeopardize their own peaceful drive for
democracy.
   After a week of intense work, Baltic People's Front leaders said
Armenians and Azerbaijanis have agreed to meet in Riga, capital of
Latvia.
   Representatives of the Armenian All-National Movement and the
People's Front of Azerbaijan are tentatively scheduled to meet
Thursday, but travel problems could delay the discussions.
   The mediation effort is unusual because it bypasses the Kremlin
and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has tried unsuccessfully to
end the bitter confrontation between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   A Moscow report Tuesday by the Cable News Network meanwhile said
Gorbachev ``has spent the last eight days ... considering his
resignation as chief of the Communist Party'' and could resign when
the policy-setting Central Committee meets next Monday and Tuesday,
while still retaining the presidency of the Soviet Union. It said
Gorbachev would be following ``popular pressure to remove the party
from its monopoly control of political power.''
   The official Soviet news agency Tass late Tuesday said nothing
of any such plans and later U.S. television newscasts from Moscow,
including those by NBC and CBS, expressed skepticism.
   NBC commented on Gorbachev's problems in Azerbaijan and his
struggles with perestroika, or restructuring, in its report on the
resignation speculation.
   The Soviet government sent troops to Azerbaijan, and there have
been nearly 200 deaths in the latest round of ethnic violence in
the region.
   ``The situation in the Caucasus threatens the development of
democracy in the Soviet Union as a whole, and talks could be a
constructive beginning,'' said Ints Upmacis, a lawyer and one of
three mediators from the Latvian People's Front.
   Sending Soviet soldiers to the Azerbaijani capital of Baku on
Jan. 20 ``was kind of a half-step forward to introducing the army
into all of the Soviet Union,'' said Romas Razukas, a Latvian
People's Front member responsible for organizing the talks. ``This
precedent seemed very dangerous to us.''
   People's Fronts from Latvia's Baltic neighbors, Lithuania to the
south and Estonia to the north, also are sending mediators.
   The negotiations mark the first time that non-official
organizations will take such a leading role in trying to settle a
national Soviet issue. If successful, the effort could enhance the
prestige of the Baltic movements, already in the forefront of the
Soviet reform effort.
   In Moscow, Vyacheslav A. Mikhailov, the No. 2 official of the
Communist Party Central Committee's Ethnic Relations Department,
told reporters Tuesday he was unaware of the Riga talks but that
the Kremlin would support anything that helps resolve the conflict
and ends bloodshed.
   The Latvians also see potential political gain in elections
scheduled March 18.
   ``We obviously have humanitarian intentions, but this initiative
could have great profit for us politically as well,'' said Razukas.
``We have elections to the Latvia Supreme Soviet coming up, and
this initiative shows that the Lativian People's Front is
peaceful.''
   The idea for a Baltic initiative was a direct result of the
Soviet military intervention in Azerbaijan. According to official
sources, 197 people have been killed since the violence began,
including 125 since the military moved into Baku.
   On Monday, the Estonian People's Front issued a declaration
protesting the use of military force, said Marju Lauristen, a
leader of the Estonian People's Front in an interview from her home
in Tartu. ``This move cannot be interpreted as help for the
Armenians. It is obviously a military move against the Azerbaijani
people's drive for liberation.''
   The Baltic states also are concerned about the fate of soldiers
from their region who are part of the military force.
   ``We think there are at least 500 Latvian troops taking part in
the occupation, and all the Baltic countries are interested in
resolution of the conflict because there are troops from here,''
said Upmacis.
   The People's Front movements in all three Baltic republics
insist that the quest for democracy and independence must be
peaceful and rely on parliamentary methods.
   They hope that in their role as mediators they can pursuade the
independence movements in the Caucaus to adopt a similar strategy.
   ``We will ask them to use diplomacy and follow a parliamentary
way. We want them to understand how much we have achieved through
those means,'' said Razukas.
   Serious efforts to organize the Armenian-Azerbaijani talks began
Jan. 23, but communication by telephone or telegram with Armenian
and Azerbaijani activists thousands of miles away required
around-the-clock effort and tremendous patience, Razukas said.
   The biggest obstacle to arranging talks was the territorial
dispute over the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave
located inside Azerbaijan. The Armenian population and the Armenian
republic want Nagorno-Karabakh annexed, but Azerbaijan has resisted
the idea.
   After days of negotiations, the two sides agreed that
territorial disputes would not be on the agenda. However, one of
the Armenian negotiators, Rafael Popoyan, said that the Armenians
wanted to discuss self-determination of ethnic groups, which
amounts to much the same thing.
   The two sides hve agreed to discuss three main issues: the
introduction and presence of Soviet troops in Baku and other parts
of Azerbaija and Armenia, the problem of refugees, and other
humanitarian issues.

   Heavy rains and floods have killed 22

villages of southern Lesotho, officials said Tuesday.
   Red Cross Society officials said the death toll since the

on settlements there.
   The officials said floodwaters from the Tele River had engulfed

   A man and his young son who survived the Avianca
jetliner crash filed $202.5 million federal lawsuit Tuesday
accusing the Colombian airline of negligence.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court was apparently the
first in the Thursday night crash in Cove Neck on Long Island,
which killed 73 people and injured 85.
   The lawsuit alleges Avianca failed to provide a safe and
airworthy aircraft and failed to provide a competent crew.
   Jesus Manuel Pinzon, 31, a Colombian living in Elizabeth, N.J.,
suffered broken bones, cuts and internal injuries in the crash, and
remains hospitalized, said his attorney, Robert A. Solomon.
   Solomon said Pinzon, who earned about $400 a week at a clothing
factory, will be permanently disabled and unable to work.
   Pinzon's 2-year-old son, Brian, was sitting in the seat next to
his father and was thrown out of the aircraft when the Boeing 707
slammed into a wooded hillside, Solomon said.
   ``The child was not buckled in,'' he said.
   Brian, who suffered minor head injuries and abrasions on his
back, was treated at a hospital and released.
   The Pinzons were returning from Bogota, Colombia, where they
were visiting relatives.
   The lawsuit seeks $100 million for Pinzon, $1.5 million for his
son, $1 million for his 28-year-old wife, Amanda; and $100 million
in punitive damages.
   A telephone call to Avianca's Manhattan offices seeking comment
was not answered Tuesday afternoon.

   U.S. Ambassador Mark Palmer hosted a
glitzy farewell reception Tuesday to mark the end of his foreign
service career and the start of new job as chief executive of an
East Europe-based consortium.
   ``I haven't been a typical diplomat in the past few years and I
thought I should not leave in a typical way _ and Washington is
cooperating,'' he told those gathered to wish him well in the
Hungarian National Gallery, the former royal castle.
   Guests included members of the diplomatic corps, important
Hungarian personalities including Communist Party chairman Gyula
Thuermer, government economics advisor Laszlo Antal and expatriate
Bela Kiraly, head of the revolutionary army in 1956 that tried to
topple Communism.
   Palmer had been scheduled to leave after the March general
elections, until the announcement Jan. 25 that he was joining the
newly created Central European Development Corp. as president and
chief executive officer. He subsequently resigned as ambassador to
avoid possible conflicts of interest.
   The new company, whose chairman is Estee Lauder cosmetics empire
heir Ronald S. Lauder, was created to take advantage of investment
opportunities created by the retreat of communism across much of
the Soviet bloc.
   Chilled champagne and a country and western band welcomed
guests, who were assured by Palmer that he would see regularly in
his new position.
   ``We'll have a house in Prague and an apartment in Budapest,
I'll be here every six weeks,'' he said.

   A woman suspected of killing two infant
daughters she claimed had been abducted was found guilty of
first-degree murder Tuesday in the slaying of one of them.
   Paula Marie Sims, 30, shed no tears as the guilty verdict was
read to her, but she later broke down as guards led her back to
jail.
   The jury will begin deliberations Wednesday as to whether or not
Mrs. Sims should face the death penalty.
   Jurors deliberated 10 hours over two days before returning the
verdict against the woman in the suffocation of 6-week-old Heather
Lee. Heather was one of two infant daughters Mrs. Sims reported
abducted by a masked gunman under nearly identical circumstances
three years apart.
   Madison County prosecutor Donald Weber called it the ``hardest
case I ever had to try.'' He said he thought the jury was strongly
influenced by evidence that Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert,
wanted only male children.
   ``She didn't like little girls and neither did Robert,'' said
Weber.
   The father has not been charged in either case, but Weber said
because of the verdict against Mrs. Sims, the state's attorney's
offices in Madison and Jerey counties are considering seeking grand
jury indictments against the 37-year-old man.
   Robert Sims and defense attorney Donald Groshong declined
comment.
   Mrs. Sims looked somber as the jury returned and once appeared
to wince as the verdict was read. She sat stoic with her eyes fixed
to the table in front of her.
   She didn't look up as the jurors were polled to confirm their
guilty verdicts, nor when they filed passed her and the silver
trash barrel and plastic garbage bag where the body of Heather Lee
was discovered last May 3.
   The jury found Mrs. Sims guilty of one count of first-degree
murder, two counts of obstructing justice and one count of
concealing a homicide.
   Mrs. Sims had been charged with two counts of murder to allow
prosecutors to propose different theories in Heather's death, and
jurors consolidated the counts upon conviction, Weber said.
   Weber will try to show the jury Wednesday that Mrs. Sims' crime
qualifies her for capital punishment because the victim was under
12, and the defendants conduct was especially brutal and cruel.
   If she qualifies for the death penalty, a hearing will be held
on the actual penalty, which could vary from death by injection to
imprisonment.
   Mrs. Sims also has been implicated in the 1986 death of her
firstborn, 13-day-old Loralei Marie, in Jersey County. No murder
charges have been filed in that case.
   Mrs. Sims faces trial in Jersey County on charges of obstruction
of justice and concealment of a homicide in Loralei's death.
   She reported that in June 1986, a masked gunman entered her home
while she was watching television, made her lie on the floor and
fled with Loralei. A body believed to be that of the infant was
found a week later near the family home in the rural Jersey County
town of Brighton, where they lived at the time.
   On April 29, 1989, Mrs. Sims reported that a masked gunman
approached her as she took out the garbage and ordered her back
into the house in the Madison County city of Alton, where the
family had moved. She said he knocked her unconscious and that when
she awoke, she found Heather gone.
   Heather's body was found May 3 in a garbage can across the
Mississippi River in nearby West Alton, Mo.
   Mrs. Sims has been jailed since the murder charges were filed in
July. Her husband has had custody of the couple's son, Randy, who
turns 2 Thursday.

<HEAD>49 Jail Inmates Escape Santiago Cell after Digging Tunnel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Forty-nine leftist guerrillas including
several who tried to kill President Augusto Pinochet in 1986
escaped from a downtown jail Tuesday through a tunnel they spent a
year digging, officials said.
   Authorities said six of the escapees were quickly captured by
police, but the others remained at large, prison officials said.
   One other prisoner proved too big for the tunnel's entrance and
was found stuck in it, they said.
   Horacio Ojeda, director of the national prison system, said the
inmates dug a tunnel about 100 yards long and 20 inches wide from a
cell block to a nearby lot where a subway station was being
constructed. The tunnel passed under a busy road.
   The escape was discovered at 2:30 a.m., Ojeda said.
   Several hours later, a man who identified himself as one of the
escapees called Radio Cooperativa in Santiago with details of the
operation.
   The man said construction of the tunnel took more than a year
and that 24 inmates took part in planning and carrying out the
escape.
   ``The tunnel has a ventilation system operated with blowers,''
the man said. ``It has electric light and a rail system we used to
take out the removed material.''
   ``After we left, the tunnel remained open, and we think it was
used by other prisoners who were not part of our plan,'' the caller
added.
   The details desribed by the caller coincided with what reporters
saw at the prison.
   The entrance to the tunnel was inside a cell. The inmates used a
heavy cement block to cover the hole and hide it from the prison
guards.
   Ojeda described all the escapees as leftists, and said several
were convicted in a Sept. 7, 1986, ambush of Pinochet's motorcade
southeast of Santiago.
   Pinochet was unhurt but five bodyguards were killed and 11
wounded in the attack, carried out by the pro-Communist Manuel
Rodriguez Patriotic Front.
   Pinochet took power following a 1973 coup that topped elected
President Salvador Allende. He is scheduled to turn over power to a
civilian government in February.
   Other escapees were Front members implicated in the smuggling of
more than 30 tons of rifles, rockets, bazookas, grenades and other
weapons into the country in August 1986, Ojeda said.
   A list of the escapees disclosed by prison authorities includes
several top commanders of the guerrilla organization. Some belonged
to other leftist groups.
   According to a local organization of prisoners' relatives, four
of the escapees had been sentenced to death but were awaiting the
outcome of appeals. Three were convicted in the Pinochet
assassination attempt and the other for killing a policeman.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party on Tuesday
handed over more than 100 of its parliamentary seats to
pro-democracy groups to end its four-decade hold on the nation's
legislature.
   Also Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry announced Czechoslovakia and
Israel are expected to restore diplomatic ties on Feb. 8, when
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel visits this capital.
   Czechoslovakia, one of Israel's strongest supporters after the
Jewish state was founded in 1948, broke off ties over objections to
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   The realignment of parliament completed an effort to include
Czechoslovakia's emerging reform groups in the Federal Assembly
before free elections scheduled for June 8.
   It was the latest abdication of Communist power following a
popular revolution in November.
   Parliament swore in 120 new deputies, only nine of them
Communists, under an agreement by various parties and the
opposition to replace more than one-third of the 350-member
parliament.
   The action sliced the Communists' representation from 242 to
139, marking the first time since the late 1940s that the
Communists have not dominated the legislature.
   All but nine of the new seats went to the opposition and other,
established political parties.
   More than 40 political parties have emerged in the two months
since parliament removed the constitutional provision guaranteeing
the Communist Party's leading role.
   The realignment came following broad talks between the
pro-democracy leaders, the Communists and four traditionally allied
parties.
   Earlier, several discredited Communist deputies were asked to
resign and were replaced by candidates of the Civic Forum, a loose
reform coalition.
   Deputy Zdenek Jicinsky, one of the new Civic Forum deputies and
a constitutional lawyer once forced to work in menial jobs for his
human rights activities, on Tuesday presented a draft election law
to the legislature.
   The legislation requires final approval from the country's new
non-Communist president, Vaclav Havel.
   The draft proposes the principle of proportional representation
in the elections, with several limitation clauses.
   Although Jicinsky did not give precise figures in his
presentation, Civic Forum sources indicate a minimum of 10,000
supporters and 5 percent of the total national vote will be
required for a party to put a member in parliament.
   Petr Pithart, another newly elected deputy and a leader of the
Civic Forum, said he expected six to seven new political parties
would be elected into parliament.

<HEAD>Italy's Most Sought After Kidnap Victim Released by Abductors</HEAD>

   Cesare Casella, the young kidnap victim
whose two years of captivity gripped Italy, was freed Tuesday night.
   Police said a military patrol found Casella, 20, chained by the
wrist and the neck to a post near a bridge in the Aspromonte
Mountain area of southern Italy where he was believed held by the
Anonymous Kidnappers, Italy's notorious kidnap ring.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said the youth told police he was
left chained to the post by kidnappers who told him to remain calm,
that sooner or later someone would pass by and free him.
   The youth was examined by a doctor, found to be exhausted by his
imprisonment but in good condition, police said.
   ANSA said his first request was for food.
   ``Give me something to eat, I haven't eaten for three days,''
the agency quoted him as telling the military patrol.
   Casella had become a symbol of the plight of kidnap victims in
Italy. His mother, Angela Casella, was known as ``Mother Courage''
because she traveled to Aspromonte to make dramatic appeals and to
protest the kidnapping and government inaction.
   She made her first ``trip of hope'' to the Aspromonte region of
Calabria in October 1988 and returned for 10 days last June,
sleeping in a tent ``as my son is doing in these months.''
   Her complaints led to the resignations of all 42 mayors of the
Aspromonte area near Locri in sympathy with her complaints.
   ``Cesare is that you, is that really you?'' she said in a
choking voice when she spoke to him by telephone for the first time
since he was kidnapped.
   ``Yes, yes, mama. It is me,'' he replied.
   Casella, abducted in the northern town of Pavia on Jan. 18,
1988, was released near the site of a Christmas Eve shootout
between the Carbinieri, Italy's paramilitary police, and kidnappers
who had come to collect the second installment of the ransom.
   Police said one of the kidnappers was wounded and captured
during the shootout, but two others escaped.
   After the release of Casella, five people are thought to be in
the hands of the kidnap gangs, including Patrizia Tacchella,
8-year-old daughter of Imerio Tacchella, co-owner of the sportsware
manufacturing company Carrera. She has been missing more than a
day, feared kidnapped from near her home in Verona.
   Casella, whose father Luigi owns a Citroen dealership, had been
one of the longest held kidnap victims in Italy. His father
reportedly paid the 1 billion lire ($800,000) ransom demanded by
the kidappers in August of 1988 and his release appeared imminent.
   But despite the payment and emotional appeals by the mother, the
youth remained a prisoner. It was not until early 1989 that the
kidnappers responded, demanding a second payment of 5 billion lire
($4 million).
   The kidnappers did not provide any proof the youth was still
alive until September, when they sent a picture of him holding the
Sept. 3 edition of a local newspaper.
   On Nov. 10 a friend of the family received a letter from the
youth. On Christmas Eve the Carabinieri took a sack of ransom money
to a drop site but the transaction ended in a shootout and the
capture of one of the kidnappers.

   A police patrol killed 18 leftist insurgents
in a clash in Peru's eastern jungle and Maoist rebels murdered five
people in a highland state capital, authorities said Tuesday.
   The Interior Ministry said a 25-member police patrol of
counterinsurgency rangers surprised the 18 leftist rebels Sunday
near Jatunhuasi, a village 160 miles east of this capital.
   The ministry communique did not indicate if the rangers suffered
casualties or if rebel prisoners were taken. No spokesman was
available to provide details.
   The communique also did not say if the rebels belonged to the
Mao-inspired Shining Path guerrilla group or the much smaller
pro-Cuba Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. Both bands are active
in Peru's jungle regions.
   In other violence, Shining Path guerrillas murdered five people
before dawn Tuesday in Ayacucho, the rebel group's stronghold,
accusing them of being government collaborators, police said.
   Rebels dragged two school teachers, a laborer, an artisan and a
merchant from their homes in a shantytown in northern Ayacucho, 235
miles southeast of Lima, and shot them to death, police said.
   The guerrillas threw signs over the bodies with inscriptions in
red ink that said, ``This is the way black heads die.''
   The Shining Path calls government collaborators ``black heads.''
The name is a derogatory reference to the black ski masks used by
army troops that patrol the mountainous insurgency zones.
   The Shining Path began its insurgency in the impoverished
countryside around Ayacucho in May 1980.
   Since then, the violence has spread throughout Peru and more
than 17,500 people, including soldiers, policemen, authorities,
rebels and civilians, have been killed.

   Northern New England's biggest storm of the winter dumped up to
28 inches of snow and closed schools, a legislature and businesses
Tuesday _ even part of L.L. Bean shut down _ and ended a snow
drought for many ski areas.
   ``This is as close to heaven for a skier as you can get,'' said
a jubilant Nancy Marshall, spokeswoman at Sugarloaf USA in
Carrabassett Valley, Maine, which at midday reported 22 inches of
fresh snow at the base, 24 inches at the summit and no sign the
snowfall was letting up.
   ``It's a real old-fashioned snowstorm,'' said Vermont Highway
Department spokesman Ray Burke. ``Lots of inches. That's Vermont.''
   However, at least one traffic death in New Hampshire was blamed
on the storm Monday and roads were snow-covered and slippery
Tuesday across Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
   In Dexter, Maine, a snow-covered roof collapsed late in the
afternoon at the R.H. Reny department store, slightly injuring
three people. Most customers had been ushered from the store when
the roof began creaking shortly before the collapse.
   ``I heard this crash, it sounded like a roll of thunder,'' said
a witness, Jerry Townsend.
   Two women and a fireman were treated and released from Mayo
Regional Hospital in Dover, said hospital director Robert McReavy.
   By Tuesday afternoon, the day-long snowfall ended in much of
Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont and the sky turned blue as the
storm moved rapidly from the Gulf of Maine into Nova Scotia.
   But near-blizzard conditions continued in northern Maine's
Aroostook County and state police said a 40-mile stretch of
Interstate 95 between Houlton and Sherman was closed to all traffic
for two hours Tuesday morning.
   ``We've got whiteout conditions, treacherous driving and
numerous vehicles off the road,'' said a dispatcher at the state
police barracks in Houlton.
   Snow accumulations in most of the region ranged from 1 to 2
feet. Andover, Vt., got 28 inches, while 15 to 20 inches of snow
was reported along the eastern slopes of New Hampshire's White
Mountains, according to the National Weather Service. Mount Holly,
Vt., got 24 inches; Montpelier, Vt., got 20 inches; Nashua, N.H.,
16 inches; and Portland, Maine, 11 inches.
   Eastern New York state also got heavy snow from the storm, with
17 inches at Utica, Piseco Lake and Bolton Landing, and 11 inches
at Albany, the weather service said.
   Many youngsters got an unscheduled holiday Tuesday when schools
canceled classes because of travel conditions. Some took advantage
of the day off to go skiing.
   ``Schools may have closed but kids aren't having any problem
finding their way here,'' said Dave Buckman, marketing director at
Gunstock ski area in Gilford, N.H.
   A number of major businesses called off work for the day
Tuesday. The manufacturing facilities and distribution center at
L.L. Bean Inc., the supplier of clothing and gear for campers and
would-be woodsmen in Freeport, Maine, were closed. The first shift
at Bath Iron Works was shut down. Others, including National Life
Insurance Co. in Montpelier, Vt., opened a few hours late.
   In New Hampshire, the storm forced a reshuffling of the
legislative calendar. Tuesday's state Senate hearings were put off
until Thursday, but the full Senate met as planned in the
afternoon. The House postponed its Tuesday session until Wednesday.
   Howling wind and heavy seas snapped one of two tow lines being
used to haul the Navy's new Aegis cruiser Gettysburg down the Maine
coast from Bath to Portland, forcing some 35 shipyard workers and
Navy officials to ride out the storm at sea, said Jim McGregor,
spokesman at Bath Iron Works.
   No injuries were reported, but the ship dropped anchor outside
Portland Harbor as a precaution.
   The storm ended a January snow drought for many ski areas, some
of which had been forced to rely on man-made snow to keep their
slopes white.
   ``It's the most snow we have had in one storm for the past two
or three years. This is just what we needed,'' said Buckman at the
Gunstock ski area.
   ``January wasn't a good month for snow,'' Sugarloaf's Ms.
Marshall noted. ``Mother Nature is back in good graces with us
now.''

   Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer said
Tuesday that officials had found no evidence to support claims by
Greenpeace that a Philippine vessel planned to supply a Japanese
drift-net fleet.
   He said the investigation was continuing, however.
   New Zealand and many other South Pacific nations oppose
drift-net fishing. Environmentalists say the huge nets trap
virtually everything they cover and could decimate marine life.
   Earlier Tuesday, Greenpeace said it made a ``citizen's arrest''
by tying the Philippine ship We Carrier with heavy chain at
Auckland Harbor.
   Greenpeace said it acted after intercepting radio messages at
sea in which a Japanese control ship told other vessels in the
drift-net fleet to meet the Philippine tanker to refuel.
   Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries inspectors searched the
tanker but found no evidence to corroborate Greenpeace's claims,
Palmer said in a statement. He said officials of the Ministry of
External Relations and Trade were investigating.
   Palmer said the government would be reluctant to take action
without evidence.
   ``It is very unfortunate that Greenpeace is unable to produce
firsthand evidence of the radio communications they overheard,'' he
said. ``It seems that tape recordings were accidentally wiped.''
   However, if evidence suggests the tanker was supporting the
drift-net fleet, Palmer said he would ask the Auckland company to
``withdraw its arrangements'' with the vessel.
   At a meeting in Wellington in November, 20 South Pacific nations
endorsed a pact aimed at banning the huge drift nets in their
waters. Under the Wellington Driftnet Convention, nations can
prohibit port access to drift-net vessels and to ships that supply
drift-net fleets.
   Palmer said his government was preparing legislation to carry
out the convention's provisions.
   Greenpeace claimed the We Carrier was preparing to resupply a
fleet of 20 Japanese drift netters in the Tasman Sea Wednesday.
   ``We took this action as a continuation of our Tasman Sea
drift-nets expedition against Japan and Taiwan,'' said Greenpeace
drift-nets campaigner Mike Hagler. ``The resupply of the Japanese
... fleet must be stopped if we are to stop the drift-net slaughter
of whales and dolphins and the decimation of the South Pacific
albacore tuna stocks.''
   The group said it feared hundreds of whales and thousands of
dolphins would be killed before the end of the five-month fishing
season in April.

   A man investigated in the mail bomb
slayings last month of a federal judge and a civil rights attorney
gave samples of his blood, saliva and hair to the FBI on Tuesday.
   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, accompanied by his attorney, was taken
by police to a hospital, where he spent 45 minutes providing
samples requested in a federal grand jury subpoena issued last week.
   Emerging from the hospital, O'Ferrell said he was happy to
comply with the subpoena and told reporters he has cooperated with
the investigation since the FBI arrived in this southeast Alabama
city on Jan. 22.
   His attorney, Paul Harden, said the FBI did not tell him what
they planned to do with the samples.
   O'Ferrell, a 46-year-old Enterprise junk dealer, has been
questioned extensively in the FBI's investigation of the slayings
of 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert Vance of
Birmingham and Robert Robinson, an NAACP attorney from Savannah, Ga.
   Similar package bombs were discovered and defused at the 11th
Circuit courthouse in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla., chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Agents have confiscated typewriters from O'Ferrell. Federal
sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the printing
on the bomber's letters matched that on a 1988 letter O'Ferrell
wrote to the 11th Circuit concerning a case he lost before the
court.
   Agents last week searched O'Ferrell's home and business and
pumped out his septic tanks looking for evidence. The FBI has
refused to say whether it found any clues, but dozens of agents
remain in southeast Alabama.
   In another development, a pipe bomb mailed to a church in
Houston exploded Tuesday morning, injuring Lisa Osteen, the
30-year-old daughter of the pastor, the Rev. John Osteen.
   Charles B. Kearney, an FBI spokesman in Houston, said there did
not appear to be any similarities between the Texas bomb and the
December mail bombs.
   However, O'Ferrell and Harden said the Houston bombing should
demonstrate that O'Ferrell had nothing to do with any of the
attacks.
   ``It's a sad state of affairs, but it does in my mind show Wayne
O'Ferrell, who has been in Enterprise since day one, is in no way,
shape or form involved,'' Harden said.

<HEAD>Poland Asks for Membership in Council of Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland applied Tuesday for full
membership in the 23-nation Council of Europe, the oldest postwar
organization for European unity.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki announced Poland's application
in a speech to the Council's assembly: ``The Council of Europe,
which has performed wonders in the defense of rights and freedoms
and which is a rich fountainhead of European ideas and initiatives
seems the right place for Poland.''
   Poland, which has had observer status in the organization since
June 8, is the second East European nation to apply for membership
of the Strasbourg-based Council. Hungary, following Poland with its
own democratic reforms, applied on Nov. 16.
   Set up in 1949, the Council is a political organization
particularly active in human rights and legal and cultural
cooperation and is separate from the European Community. Membership
is open only to European countries that have a democratic and
pluralistic parliament.
   Addressing this issue, Mazowiecki said that although Poland was
``confronted with the enormous task of reconstituting the rights
and the institutions which characterize modern democracies ...
Poland has already set to work.''
   He stressed his government had drafted and enacted laws for the
independence of the judiciary, for freedom of the press, freedom to
organize and found political parties and for local self-government.
   The Polish premier appealed for help in the ``huge job'' facing
Eastern and Central Europe to ``fill in the gulf between poor
Europe and affluent Europe.''
   He said ``we now need new guidelines to point our endeavors down
a common European road, to no-one's exclusion and everyone's
advantage.''
   But unlike his counterpart from Hungary, Miklos Nemeth, who on
Monday also addressed the Council of Europe, saying his country was
paying ``particular attention'' to its relations with the 12-nation
European Community, Mazowiecki hinted that membership in the EC was
not upcoming for Poland.
   Europe at the turn of the century would ``certainly not be a
European area with free movement of goods, capital and people,''
nor ``a Europe with a common currency,'' he said referring to the
EC's plans to achieve a single market by the end of 1992 and its
longer-term plans for monetary union.
   Instead, he said, the time had come to ``establish institutions
genuinely encompassing the whole of Europe.''

   Bush administration officials said they could
not confirm a broadcast report Tuesday that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev was considering relinquishing his post as head of
the Soviet Communist Party.
   ``All I can tell you ... is that it's a rumor, and therefore
it's not something that I think that we should respond to or react
to,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III told reporters after
the report was aired by Cable News Network.
   Baker spoke as an aide announced a rescheduling of talks in
Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and said
the one-day delay was to avoid interfering with a meeting of the
Communist Party Central Committee. Baker will be in Moscow Feb.
8-9, said spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``We're following the story, as I know you are, and we'll have a
comment if we ever determine it's something more than just a
rumor,'' Baker said of the CNN account.
   CNN, quoting a ``well-informed and usually reliable'' party
source, said from Moscow that the re-emergence of Gorbachev on
telvision on Tuesday did not rule out a dramatic resignation when
the policy-setting Central Committee meets next Monday and Tuesday.
   Before the TV appearance on Tuesday, Gorbachev was last seen in
public Jan. 20 explaining why Soviet troops had been sent to the
Azerbaijan republic.
   According to the unnamed source, Gorbachev had resisted sending
troops into Baku, the capital of the republic, and was suffering
severe depression over the action, CNN said.
   White House chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters the
administration has been ``trying for the last few hours to try and
get some additional assessments, but I don't have anything at all.''
   ``We would like to understand the details of what's involved and
what's implied if such a change has taken place,'' he said. ``And
frankly at the time we're talking here, I don't know if it's
correct.''
   Bush administration officials and intelligence sources, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said there has been speculation for
weeks that Gorbachev would yield his party post _ while retaining
the presidency _ but that they had no information he would take the
step.
   One senior administration official said that if true, the
decision ``might mean that there's a move toward pluralism in mind,
it might mean there's a problem, it might be a plus. And very
frankly you can create scenarios on both sides. ... You can make an
argument that it's a reflection of strength and you can make an
argument that it's a reflection of weakness.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., Senate chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Commitee, said he had no confirmation of the report,
but if true it ``may in fact enhance Gorbachev's chances for
survival'' by making it more difficult for party bosses opposed to
his policies to criticize him.
   Ever since his assumption of the top party post in 1985,
Ghorbachev has sought to separate the party and the government. The
party has ruled the country since the 1917 revolution, with the
government a distinctly secondary entity.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign
Relations Committee, said he had no independent knowledge of
Gorbachev's plans but that a resignation as party leader would
represent an important loss of power for the Soviet leader and
throw uncertainty into U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the report should
mean caution about cutting military spending: ``Let's call off this
mad rush to spend a dividend we don't even have yet.''
   Baker said American diplomats in Moscow ``know just about the
same thing that all the rest of us know right now _ that there's a
rumor out there to this effect, and that's all we know.''
   He said his talks in Moscow were ``still very much on.''
   Asked about the CNN report, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said: ``I have no idea. We've never heard of it before. I
have no information.''
   He said of the Baker trip to Moscow: ``It was just delayed one
day.''
   Baker and Shevardnadze will meet Feb. 8-9 in the Soviet capital,
a day delay at the suggestion of the U.S. government, said Ms.
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman.
   Issues to be discussed include arms control and the war in
Afghanistan between the Soviet-backed government and U.S.-armed
rebels.
   ``It simply makes more sense to have the Soviets complete their
plenum before beginning this important ministerial,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said.
   Baker also is expected to make a brief visit to Czechoslovakia,
although there has been no announcement on that.
   One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there have been reports that Gorbachev was frustrated over efforts
to reform the Communist Party. He said the speculation was that
Gorbachev would remain in charge of the government as president, a
post he has strengthened.
   However, he stressed there was no information to the effect that
Gorbachev would take the step.
   Another administration official said Jack Matlock Jr., the U.S.
ambassador to Moscow, had been asked about the CNN report and
replied he was unaware of any such development.
   The intelligence sources said the report was given impetus by
Baker's schedule change.
   Meanwhile, the report caused turmoil on Wall Street and a
negative reaction on Capitol Hill.
   Stock prices were so volatile after the CNN report aired that
one investment brokerage stopped trading temporarily while the
market calmed down.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell immediately after
the Gorbachev report but quickly recovered, finishing down 10.14 on
a day when prices were also pushed downward by congressional
testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Chief Cuts Short Tour, Saying Offensive Launched</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL AMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi cut
short a tour of Western Europe Tuesday, saying the government
launched a major air offensive against strongholds of his UNITA
guerrillas in that southern African state.
   He told a Lisbon news conference Soviet-supplied MiG and Sukhoi
warplanes began bombing UNITA positions in southeast Angola Monday,
between the Kuzumbia River and the rebel base of Mavinga, about 685
miles southeast of Luanda.
   Savimbi called the raids the biggest since civil war began in
1975 between his U.S.-backed rebels and the Marxist government that
took power when Angola gained independence from Portugal.
   ``It's the first time in 14 years that we've had these sweeping
raids,'' he said, with up to 14 planes being used in single attacks.
   A government official contacted by telephone Tuesday in Luanda,
Angola's capital, declined to comment about air raids, but said
forces under President Jose Eduardo dos Santos were creating
serious problems for the rebels.
   Savimbi had arrived in Lisbon Saturday for an eight-day visit,
planning to go on to West Germany, Belgium and Switzerland.
   Despite the raids, he hinted that chances for restarting stalled
peace talks were increased by his visit here.
   ``There are movements again to start negotiations,'' he said.
   He said Portugal agreed to help as a link between UNITA _ the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ and the
Luanda government.
   Savimbi said that for the first time Angola used sophisticated
Sukhoi-25 ground attack planes supplied by the Soviets last year.
   He said about 11,000 civilians lived in the area under attack.
   The rebels shot down two MiGs and captured two pilots, Savimbi
claimed.
   The United States supplies the rebels with Stinger ground-to-air
missiles among a reported $50 million of U.S. military aid send
yearly to UNITA.
   The rebel leader said Mavinga was in no danger of falling to
government forces and that bush headquarters at Jamba was not
affected by the bombing.
   In Luanda on Tuesday, a military official said Mavinga was
surrounded and could fall soon.
   The state-run news media made no mention Tuesday of any fighting
in the south.
   Savimbi said he will return to organize ground defenses along
the Lomba River, an important natural barrier protecting rebel
territory in the southeast.
   Savimbi's visit to Portugal was the first since Angola became
independent. Portuguese authorities earlier refused to grant him a
visa.
   During his stay, he met President Mario Soares and Prime
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. He suggested the raids were meant to
counteract what he said was the public relations success of his
visit.
   Efforts to reach a peaceful solution have floundered since a
cease-fire sealed by a handshake between Savimbi and dos Santos
last June in Gbadolite, Zaire, broke down amid renewed fighting.
   Cavaco Silva's center-right government has built up warm
relations with the Luanda government and has recently begun
high-level talks with UNITA.
   The United States has also stepped up diplomatic efforts to
break the deadlock.
   Savimbi said that before returning to Angola, he will stop off
at other African countries, not identified, for talks with leaders
sympathetic to his movement.

<HEAD>Defect Leads to Inspection of British Nuclear Submarines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ministry of Defense said Tuesday night that a
defect was found in the reactor of one of the Royal Navy's
nuclear-powered submarines and that the entire fleet will be
examined.
   A ministry statement said the ``technical defect'' was found
during a routine check and that its decision to inspect the other
19 submarines was a ``prudent precaution.'' It did not describe the
defect.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the
defect was most likely a hairline fracture in the submarine's
primary cooling system, which has to endure considerable
temperatures and pressures.
   The agency said the fault was discovered during an examination
of a Valiant class submarine at Devonport dockyard in Plymouth,
southwestern England.
   A Ministry of Defense spokesman said on condition of anonymity
that personnel working on the refit and crews at sea were not in
danger.
   ``The submarines are not unsafe. Safety is paramount,'' he said.
   Submarines in the Valiant class are the navy's oldest and were
built between 1966 and 1971. They include HMS Conqueror, which sank
the Argentine battle cruiser Belgrano during the 1982 war over the
Falkland Islands.
   Accounts of the campaign said the Conqueror's reactor
experienced problems as the sub sailed to the Falklands but that
the crew shut down the reactor solved the trouble.
   Conqueror is the only nuclear submarine of any country known to
have seen action.

<HEAD>Tunisian on Trial in Paris Bombings Says He is Islamic Terrorist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tunisian accused of directing a bombing campaign
that killed 13 people in Paris told a court Tuesday he is a
terrorist pursuing holy war on behalf of Islam.
   ``I am a terrorist. One must terrorize the enemies of God, says
the Koran, chapter eight. I am the Moslem who preaches holy war,''
Fouad Ali Saleh said in the second day of his trial.
   He remained calmer Tuesday than he had at trial opening on
Monday, when he was expelled from the courtroom for the day after
loudly declaiming, ``My name is `Death to the West.' You have
killed Moslems. This is war.''
   Saleh, 31; his French wife, Karima, and eight other men _ three
Tunisians, two Moroccans and three Lebanese _ are being tried for
terrorist conspiracy, possession of illegal arms, trafficking in
explosives and drug offenses.
   They are to be tried again later this year on murder charges in
connection with the 1986 bombings, which killed 13 people and
injured more than 250.
   Eight others are being tried in their absence in this trial,
expected to end next week. If convicted, the defendants face 10 to
20 years in prison.
   After Presiding Judge Henri Malerge described what the
defendants are accused of doing, Saleh said, ``You say transporting
explosives is illegal, but the West has transported tons of them to
colonize the Moslems. France, Jews and Free Masons were the
spearhead of colonization.''
   In French criminal trials, defendants are allowed from time to
time to explain or comment on the evidence being presented.
   Saleh commented about several women who were victims of the 1986
bombings and are attending the trial: ``I want to say to these
women who are looking at me with eyes full of hate. ... They should
know the exact reasons for our acts. We were not happy to be
placing bombs. I don't hate them.''
   Police say Saleh recruited and directed the people who hid
explosives smuggled in from Lebanon and placed bombs in key
locations in Paris.
   He is accused of taking orders from leaders of Hezbollah, the
pro-Iranian, Shiite Moslem extremist movement in Lebanon.

   Snipers cruising by car and motorbike
killed 10 people and wounded nine, officials said, and a curfew was
imposed on the city.
   The attacks appeared to be the latest outbreak of violence
between native Sindis and immigrants from India, called mohajirs.
Officials say 23 people were killed in confrontations last month.
   Officials said Tuesday that after three weeks of calm, men in a
car fired on a crowd of people in the Seroghat district just before
noon, killing two and wounding three.
   Two men on a motorbike sprayed gunfire later in the Bhuleli
district, killing eight people and wounding six, witnesses said.
   An angry crowd in Bhuleli protested the shootings by burning a
local police station to the ground. Officials said the officers
fled without injuries.
   Authorities then imposed a curfew on the city's 300,000
residents, and enforced it with army and police armored patrols.
   Officials said the shooting victims included Sindis and mohajirs
but they refused to speculate on who the gunmen were.
   Hyderabad, 100 miles northeast of Karachi, has been the site of
repeated Sindi-mohajir clashes since 1986. Hundreds have died and
thousands have been wounded.

   Lawyers said Tuesday a jury could be
seated by the end of the week for the trial of the former skipper
of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which caused the nation's worst oil
spill.
   Under relentless prodding from Superior Court Judge Karl
Johnstone, attorneys questioned 10 jurors Tuesday from a pool of 91
drawn for the trial of Joseph Hazelwood. Four were excused from the
case.
   Two of those dismissed had expressed concerns about financial
problems if the trial were to last two months or longer. The others
said they already had made up their minds about who was responsible
for the accident.
   ``This would be a tough one for me ... a lot of damage has been
done,'' one prospective juror told the court.
   Johnstone pushed lawyers from both sides to speed their
examinations.
   ``It's going much faster than I expected,'' said defense lawyer
Dick Madson, complaining to reporters that Johnstone was limiting
questioning.
   Asked if 12 jurors could be seated by Friday, he replied, ``If
he keeps cutting off questions like he is, yes.''
   Hazelwood, 43, faces one felony charge of criminal mischief and
three misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent
discharge of oil and operating on a vessel while intoxicated. The
maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years, three
months in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   After the tanker Exxon Valdez ripped its hull apart on Bligh
Reef last March 24, it spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude
oil into Prince William Sound.
   The sludge coated hundreds of miles of shoreline, killed
thousands of marine mammals and prompted what Exxon said was a $2
billion cleanup operation involving tens of thousands of workers.
   Hazelwood's trial began Monday, with Johnstone rejecting another
round of defense efforts to get charges dismissed. Madson had
argued that charges should be dismissed because the state lacks
jurisdiction.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks between Hungary and the Soviet
Union on withdrawing all Soviet troops from the country by the end
of the year open this week in Budapest, the state news agency MTI
said Tuesday.
   Delegations headed by deputy foreign ministers on both sides
will meet Thursday and Friday in the second such negotiations in
Eastern Europe since a wave of democratization started loosening
the Soviet grip over its Warsaw Pact allies.
   The first such talks, held in Prague on withdrawing Soviet
troops from Czechoslovakia, ended inconclusively this month. A
second round of Soviet-Czechoslovak negotiations is due in early
February.
   The estimated 50,000 Soviet troops in Hungary, and about 70,000
in Czechoslovakia, are stationed on the basis of ``temporary''
agreements the Kremlin reached with the two countries after
quashing revolts against Stalinism in 1956 in Hungary and in 1968
in Czechoslovakia.
   While Moscow has signaled willingness to discuss the demands
from Prague and Budapest for withdrawal, it is not clear whether
the Soviets want the pullouts coordinated with cutbacks due for
agreement this year at the Vienna talks on reducing conventional
forces in Europe.
   MTI said Thursday's talks will be attended by senior military
figures on each side.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth announced last week the
negotations would begin after he had consulted with Soviet Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on the subject.
   Nemeth said he and the Soviet agreed that ``the hitherto basis
for the stationing of troops on Hungarian soil has outlived itself.
There are neither military nor political reasons for their
presence.''
   Nemeth said Hungary's strategic and geographic position _ unlike
Czechoslovakia, it does not border a NATO country _ and its policy
meant the Soviet troops could withdraw ``at the earliest possible
time.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday with
East German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open toward
eventual German reunification.
   Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev ``did not
rule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time did
not venture to set some time limits for that.''
   Earlier, the Kremlin chief said any such decisions must include
the four Allied powers and take into account European opinions.
   ``The development of events in the world, in East Germany, in
the Soviet Union demand deep consideration and an analytical
approach to deciding this problem,'' he said in remarks reported by
the official news agency Tass.
   ``Time itself is acting on this process, giving it dynamism,''
Gorbachev said. ``We have to act responsibly and not decide this
important question on the streets.''
   Tass said Gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring
relations between the two Germanys must involve ``all directly
interested governments.''
   Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude toward
reunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and
that ``no one can cast doubt'' on the reasonableness of asking it.
   However, the English-language Tass translation indicated
Gorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunification
itself.
   Gorbachev's position was similar to that adopted by Communists
in East Berlin on Tuesday. For the first time, the Communists
acknowledged German unity as a long-term goal but said it must be
imbedded in the process of overcoming Europe's overall divisions.
   The Soviet Union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of
German reunification, but Gorbachev has softened that position in
adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.
   Soviets say the question of German reunification is to be
decided in the future.
   Gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meeting French
President Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated his
view that the existence of two German states is a fact based on the
outcome of World War II.
   But he added, ``The present situation is the result of specific
historical events, a specific historical process on this continent.
So, history should decide the future of this continent.''
   ``I don't think it is a topical question today. A different
approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire
European process, including the relations between the two German
states,'' Gorbachev said.
   Modrow said the two Germanys could work toward confederation in
phases with no time limit.
   He said he agreed with Gorbachev that reunification must be
decided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.
   According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action on
reunification must not infringe on the interests of either East or
West Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the United
States or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.
   Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free Democratic
Party, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in London
that Gorbachev has adopted ``a more positive attitude'' toward
German reunification.
   In a TV interview on Britain's Channel 4, he also urged
``economic union'' within 18 months as a prelude to full union of
West and East Germany.
   Lambsdorff said that because of East Germany's political
instability it had only two choices _ unification or chaos.
   Modrow invited Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov to visit
East Germany and they accepted, Tass reported.
   Modrow arrived in Moscow late Monday. A Communist, he has moved
forward the country's first free elections from May to March 18 and
brought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then.

   A school bus skidded off a road and into a

   Most of the vehicle's roof was sheared off in the accident,
which occurred around 2:40 p.m. in this town 55 miles northwest of
New York City. The bus was taking 38 pupils home from an elementary
school.
   Thirty-six children were taken to six hospitals, State Trooper
Robert Gillespie said. Six were admitted with serious injuries _
one in critical condition _ four with lesser injuries and 26 were
treated and released, hospital officials said.
   Some of the children were still being evaluated, but at least
three suffered serious head injuries, said Barry Bowman, a
spokesman for Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla.
   Gillespie said no charges would be filed against the bus driver,
63-year-old Andrew Callahan, who was hospitalized in fair
condition. Troopers were still looking for the cause of the
accident Tuesday night, he said.
   ``He was not speeding,'' Gillespie said. ``It was a dry road. It
was sunny out when the accident occurred. We just have to determine
why he drove off the road at that point.''
   The accident occurred about 15 miles south of the site where a
elementary school wall collapsed when a tornado struck last year,
killing nine children.

<HEAD>Doctors Perform Heart Operations on Baby in Womb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors at a London hospital said Tuesday night
they had conducted what they believe are the world's first
successful heart operations on a baby still in the womb.
   Lindsey Allan, the doctor in charge of the fetal cardiology unit
at Guys Hospital, said the team there had corrected a heart valve
defect in an unborn boy using a balloon catheter guided into place
by ultrasonic sound.
   ``As far as I know this is the first successful operation of its
kind,'' she said.
   She said two operations were carried out on the fetus during the
mother's pregnancy, one at 31 weeks and the second at 33 weeks.
   Ms. Allan said the baby was born prematurely on Jan. 4 _ one
week after the second operation _ and underwent surgery for the
third time a few hours after birth.
   She did not say why there had been a delay in disclosing details
of the operations.
   ``The child is still quite seriously ill, but we have given him
a chance he would not otherwise have had,'' Ms. Allan said.
   She said the parents, who did not want to be identified, lived
outside London.
   The operations involved inserting a catheter down a hollow
needle directly into the chest wall and heart of the fetus. Once in
place, the balloon was dilated to open the heart valve.
   A catheter is a slender tube inserted into a body passage,
vessel or cavity. Its normal uses include passing fluids and making
examinations.
   Ms. Allan said the team that pioneered the technique included
herself; Michael Tynan, professor of pediatric cardiology; and
Darryl Maxwell, director of the hospital's fetal medicine unit.
   She said there were always ethical obstacles to this type of
operation.
   ``I am not sure that we should be meddling sometimes. There is
always discussion as to whether it is a reasonable request to make
of the mother. On the other hand, one knows that the alternative is
almost universally fatal,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The military government dropped criminal
charges against a major critic Tuesday, and President Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida said his administration will not try to muzzle public
opinion.
   Gani Fawehinmi, a lawyer already sentenced this month to a year
in prison for contempt of court, was to be charged Tuesday with
trying to sabotage the military's plan for return to civilian rule.
   But prosecutors said they were told to drop the charges. Whether
the decision will affect the contempt of court ruling was not clear.
   In remarks read for him Tuesday, Babangida said the military
``keeps an open door for well-considered, clearly articulated and
constructive suggestions.''
   Fawenhinmi was cited for contempt for telling a judge he had no
faith in his impartiality.
   The Civil Liberties Organization, this West African nation's
main human rights group, called his imprisonment ``a scandalous
abuse of judicial powers.''
   The country's bar association also appealed to Babangida to
overturn the decision and drop all charges against the lawyer.
   The lawyers and human rights group also have campaigned for
elimination of a decree that lets the military detain critics
without charge. Babangida announced a relaxation of the decree last
week, reducing from six months to six weeks the time detainees
could be held without charge.

<TEXT>
   Waves swamped an overloaded Haitian sailboat as
Coast Guard crewmen were trying to transfer the passengers to their
cutter, and two people may have drowned in the confusion,
authorities said Tuesday.
   The cutter Thetis arrived in Port-au-Prince Tuesday with the
remaining 48 people aboard, and the Coast Guard has launched an
investigation into the incident, said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Karonis.
   The sinking occurred Sunday afternoon when the Thetis
intercepted the 30-foot sailboat about 400 miles southeast of Miami.
   After U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service determined the
passengers were illegally attempting to enter the United States,
the Coast Guard distributed lifejackets and began transferring the
Haitians to the cutter.
   ``A large wave caused the Haitian vessel to capsize and sink,
throwing the Haitians, the Coast Guard boarding party and the INS
agent into the water,'' a Coast Guard release said.
   Four Haitians were injured _ one was cut and three nearly
drowned _ and passengers reported two others were missing.
   But because the boat carried no passenger list, the Coast Guard
could not determine if the report was accurate, the release said.
   A search was conducted, but no sign of the two was found,
Karonis said. At the time of the accident, winds were 10 knots with
seas of 5 to 7 feet.

<TEXT>
   Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil won a libel case
Tuesday against a rival who questioned his taste in women, ending a
trial that took the public into the world of Fleet Street's private
passions.
   Neil sued The Sunday Telegraph and its former editor, Peregrine
Worsthorne, over an editorial Worsthorne wrote last March saying
Neil's affair with a call girl rendered him unfit to edit a quality
newspaper. A second article and a cartoon were also cited by Neil.
   ``It's a clear vindication. I'm delighted,'' said Neil. ``It's
been a tough battle. I'm happy with the award.''
   Worsthorne, who had argued that his article was fair comment,
claimed the damages ``were so derisory that it was as good as a
victory.''
   A High Court jury awarded Neil about $1,600 in damages, while
his employer, Times Newspapers, walked away with just $1 _ the
price of the paper.
   The awards were minimal, compared with the six- and even
seven-figure sums handed out to libel victims lately.
   The biggest money winners were the lawyers. The defendants were
ordered to pay an estimated $320,000 in court costs.
   Worsthorne said it was a case ``that should never have been
brought and Mr. Neil should be ashamed of himself. Let this case
teach all editors a lesson: Don't sue.''
   Worsthorne's editorial, titled ``Playboys as Editors,'' claimed
Neil's four-month affair with call girl Pamella Bordes had brought
the Sunday Times into disrepute.
   Neil, a 40-year-old bachelor, sued, saying it was the ``most
damaging attack on my professional integrity'' in his six years as
Sunday Times editor.
   He insisted that contrary to what Worsthorne wrote, he did not
know Ms. Bordes, 27, was a call girl until after their affair ended.
   Ms. Bordes was not in court.
   She became news when tabloid newspapers reported she had worked
at the House of Commons as a researcher and had been escorted the
previous year by Neil and another Sunday newspaper editor, Donald
Trelford of The Observer.
   Trelford took no action.
   Neil's award, sniped Worsthorne on Independent Television News,
``wouldn't even pay for a weekend with Ms. Bordes.''
   Neil countered that the outcome of the libel case was ``a
victory for the new Britain against the old Britain'' _ a swipe at
the crusty, conservative style of the Telegraph and 66-year-old
Worsthorne.
   The damages suggested that the jury agreed with Judge Michael
Davies, who said in summing up that the case might be ``much ado
about nothing.''
   Davies said the case reminded him of two great steam locomotives
crashing head on.

   Voters picking a successor to a city
councilman killed in a rash of mail bombings narrowed the field
from eight candidates to two on Tuesday.
   Educator Clifford Hardwick III and dentist Phyllis Mack led the
pack in complete but unofficial returns, and are to meet in a Feb.
20 runoff for Robert Robinson's Council seat.
   Robinson, a black attorney who worked on civil rights cases, was
killed when he opened a package bomb at his law office Dec. 18. A
letter claiming responsibility threatened more attacks on black
leaders.
   Hardwick received 920 of the 2,572 votes cast, Mack had 494 and
Mary Evans Roberts had 444. The others received votes of 210 or
less, including the candidate endorsed by Robinson's widow, Horace
Hall, who got 201.
   Elections supervisor Patty McKenna said the 29 percent turnout
was about normal for an election in the district, despite the high
emotion provoked by the Robinson slaying.
   The Rev. Henry R. Delaney said some black people in Savannah are
``apprehensive'' about packages. A secretary at the Savannah office
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
told a reporter she could no longer release the names of NAACP
officers.
   ``In light of what's been happening to our people, I'm not at
liberty to give out the names of any people affiliated with our
organization,'' said the secretary. She declined to give her name.
   In Mountain Brook, Ala., there has been little discussion of
fear for personal safety, although federal marshals still keep
watch in the driveway of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance's home,
where he was killed by an exploding package two days before
Robinson's slaying.
   The judge's neighbors talk more about their desire to see the
killer caught and whether the FBI's dragnet for evidence in
southeastern Alabama will yield fruit. Vance's wife, Helen, was
injured in the blast but said she has recovered.
   ``There is a lot of dismay over all the latest publicity, which
doesn't seem to be coming to any conclusion unless there's an
indictment,'' said the Rev. John Claypool, rector of St. Luke's
Episcopal Church, where Vance's ashes are interred.
   The FBI has searched the property of Enterprise, Ala., junk
dealer Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, who denies wrongdoing and has not
been charged. O'Ferrell says the FBI thinks he once owned a
typewriter used in a letter claiming responsibility.
   Charles Ashby, the neighbor to whom Mrs. Vance rushed after the
explosion last month, said life is returning to normal in the
exclusive Shook Hill neighborhood, where estate-sized lots are
sprinkled with tall pine trees.
   Robinson's City Council district in Savannah is 75 percent
black, largely poor, an area where many turn-of-the-century homes
have not shared in the coastal city's zealous historic preservation.
   There, the bombings have been followed by other racial threats.
   Delaney, pastor of St. Paul's Christian Methodist Church and a
speaker at Robinson's funeral, recently received a hate letter
after he appeared on a television program. A black state
representative, Roy Allen, also got a threatening letter.
   But several people interviewed on the streets of Robinson's
district said they don't believe average black Savannah residents
feel more threatened now.
   ``I don't think it's created any excess fear,'' said city water
department employee Pearlie Frazier. ``It's just added to the
frustration that the average black person feels on a daily basis.''
   In both cities, friends of the victims are looking for positive
memories.
   Reuben Davis, a Jefferson County commissioner, wants to
establish a memorial to Vance, who pushed for racial equality while
chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party. He envisions ``a symbol
of a man that worked in his community for peace and harmony and yet
died such a violent death.''
   In Savannah, state Sen. Al Scott said Robinson's death ``perhaps
will draw attention to the senselessness'' of hate crimes and
bigotry.

   Anti-abortion activist Randall Terry, who spent
more than three months in jail rather than pay what he said was an
unjust fine for trespassing, was released from a work camp Tuesday
after the money was paid.
   Terry, founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, was
released from Fulton County's Alpharetta Institution after a
representative paid his fine of $500 plus a $50 assessment Monday,
jail and court officials said.
   Jane Shepherd, a spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, said the fine
was paid by an anonymous supporter, rather than a representative of
the organization.
   Terry of Binghamton, N.Y., had for months refused to pay a fine,
saying he could not in good conscience do so. Mary Ann Baney, a
Georgia spokeswoman for Operation Rescue, said the group would make
no statement about his decision to let the fine be paid.
   Terry originally received two one-year prison terms for criminal
trespass and unlawful assembly. The terms were consolidated into a
single one-year term in December, and officials at the time said
that with time off for good behavior he could be eligible for
release April 5.
   Terry was sentenced on Oct. 5 following his conviction on
charges stemming from anti-abortion protests at the time of the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta in July 1988.

   Mirza Abdul Baqi Beg, a physicist whose
theoretical work helped establish the model of the subatomic quark
particle, died at his home here Tuesday of a heart attack. He was
55.
   In the 1960s, Beg's work helped verify the modern quark model of
hadron structure, which describes hadrons _ nuclear particles like
protons and neutrons _ as being composites made up of smaller
entities called quarks, The Rockefeller University said in a
release.
   Prior to working in particle physics, he made significant
contributions to nuclear physics, the release said.
   Born in India, Beg earned degrees from Sind University in
Pakistan, Karachi University and the University of Pittsburgh.
   He came to Rockefeller as an assistant professor in 1964 and was
appointed a professor in 1968. Previously he was a research
associate at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island from
1960-62 and a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, N.J., from 1962-64.
   Beg had been a consultant at Brookhaven since 1965 and was a
member of its High Energy Advisory Committee from 1975-78.
   Beg was a fellow of the American Physical Society and the New
York Academy of Sciences, and a trustee of the Aspen Center for
Physics.
   He is survived by his wife, Nancie.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Tuesday blocked a critical
book about Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, finding that it
violated the copyrights of his authorized biographer.
   U.S. District Judge Louis L. Stanton said the book, which is
still in manuscript form, could be published after infringing
passages were deleted.
   Melvin Wulf, lawyer for the book's publisher, said the decision
was ``a dagger in the heart of the First Amendment'' and would not
hold up on appeal.
   ``It would be a terrible incursion into our free speech
rights,'' Wulf said.
   The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by New Era Publications
International, which has certain exclusive copyrights to Hubbard's
private papers for the purpose of writing his authorized biography.
The company also is the publisher of Scientology books.
   Hubbard, who died in 1986, founded the Church of Scientology and
wrote dozens of books about the religion and his philosophy. He
taught that spiritual competence is achieved by ``erasing'' mental
images in the unconscious mind that cause irrational behavior.
   The disputed book, ``A Piece of Blue Sky,'' is written by former
Scientologist Jonathan Caven-Atack, who became disillusioned with
Hubbard's teachings after following them for nine years.
   According to Stanton's decision, Atack ``came to believe that
Scientology is a dangerous cult and that Mr. Hubbard, far from
being the gentle prophet portrayed in Church literature, was a
paranoid, vindictive and profoundly disturbed man.''
   After receiving permission from Stanton last summer to review
the manuscript, New Era said 121 passages, slightly less than 3
percent of the book, were taken from copyrighted sources.
   The book's publisher, Carol Publishing Group, claimed the
passages were allowed by a section of copyright law called fair
use, which says copyrighted works can be used for criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching or research.
   Stanton, however, found that much of the copyrighted material in
Atack's book was used by itself at the beginning of a chapter.
   ``The evident purpose of this device, which is carried out with
some effect, is to use passages from Mr. Hubbard's work to set the
tone for the sections they precede,'' he said. ``In essence, these
passages use copyrighted materials as a literary device rather than
a basis for a critical study of Mr. Hubbard.''
   The judge said Carol Publishing could easily delete the
infringing passages. ``The only apparent hardships resulting from
an injunction are some delay in publication and a more stringent
editing process.''
   Wulf said Stanton had shown a ``total misunderstanding'' of the
fair-use law. ``It really threatens to impair the right of
biographers and scholars to study the works of other people who are
of great public interest,'' he said.
   New Era's lawyer, Jonathan Rubell, said his client had never
intended to stop the book's publication. ``It was the use of
expression rather than factual presentation that we were
complaining about,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A Honduran freighter's eight-man crew was detained
Tuesday after federal agents seized about 1,100 pounds of cocaine
found aboard the ship about 400 miles southwest of Miami,
authorities said.
   Up the coast, authorities recovered 114 pounds of cocaine hidden
in plaster molds shaped like bread loaves that washed up on beaches
in affluent Boca Raton and Gulf Stream, and were indirectly linked
to the Super Bowl.
   Coast Guardsmen seized the 195-foot Honduran freighter Katita on
Monday evening after finding 362 numbered bricks of cocaine, worth
an estimated $11.5 million wholesale, in the forward hold,
officials said.
   The freighter was picked up by radar as it was being towed to
Miami because of engine trouble. The Coast Gaurd cutter Dauntless
released the tug and took the freighter and her crew to Key West,
said Coast Guard Lt. Mac McCullough.
   The crewmen _ who are from Guatemala, Colombia and the Dominican
Republic _ were being held Tuesday while U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agents examined the freighter, McCullough said.
   The freighter's captain ``told us it was a controlled delivery,
part of a sting with the DEA,'' said Cmdr. Chuck Beck of the
Dauntless. ``We really didn't buy his story.''
   DEA spokesman John Fernandes in Miami said the crewmen would be
charged with conspiracy to import cocaine.
   No arrests were made in connection with the cocaine ``loaves''
that washed up on beaches Monday or the cocaine found in a gray
suitcase abandoned in the U.S. Customs Service's section of the
airport the same day, officials said.
   The cocaine loaves had an estimated wholesale value of $1.2
million and the cocaine in the suitcase had a value estimated at
$366,000.
   Each ``loaf'' contained about a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of the
drug. Customs officials believe traffickers threw them overboard
during a Super Bowl Sunday drug sweep dubbed Operation Pigskin.
   ``They thought we'd all be watching the game,'' said William
Boisatt, head of Customs' marine operation in Palm Beach County.
   The 50 pounds of cocaine that washed ashore in Gulf Stream
shocked police and town officials in the wealthy resort.
   ``I have never had anything like this in my 21 fun-filled years
on the New York City Police Department,'' said Gulf Stream police
Officer Gary Ward. ``This is really an exceptional amount.''

   The U.S. Justice Department is going to ask a
federal court next week to take over the longshoremen's union
because of accusations the union is controlled by organized crime,
according to a television report Tuesday.
   The Justice Department is going to argue that a trustee should
be named to oversee the International Longshoremen's Association
because of its alleged criminal affiliation, ABC News reported. The
report did not cite sources.
   A Bush administration official confirmed only that action
against segments of the union, and not the entire association, is
planned.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney of the Eastern District confirmed
that the Southern District was looking into the union, but
attorneys there had no comment.
   A spokesman for the union, Jim McNamara, said the international
had not been informed there was an investigation and he was not
aware of the action.
   The government has sought trusteeships in other cases where mob
influence was alleged. Four Teamsters locals, for instance, are
operating under court trusteeships.
   Last March, the U.S. attorney's office in the Southern District
dropped part of a racketeering lawsuit against Teamsters leadership.
   In return, the union agreed to election rule changes and the
appointment of three monitors with broad powers to oversee union
elections and management.
   The three monitors were appointed by U.S. District Judge David
Edelstein in May to serve until 1992.

<HEAD>Rediscovered Radio Scripts Staged By BBC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radio comedy scripts written by the late Groucho
Marx and his brother Chico that were unearthed by a researcher in
the U.S. Library of Congress were performed for the first time in
58 years in a London broadcast.
   A live audience at a British Broadcasting Corp. studio broke
into rapturous applause at the end of Tuesday night's performance
in which British actors, playing the roles of the two American
comedians, read the scripts of the ``Flywheel, Shyster and
Flywheel'' show.
   BBC producer Dirk Maggs said the scripts had not been heard
since being broadcast in the United States in 1932.
   He said the scripts were discovered about a year ago in the
Library of Congress in Washington by researcher Mike Barson and
that the BBC had successfully bid for exclusive rights to them.
   He did not explain the legal intricacies of the deal and did not
say how much the BBC paid.
   The scripts for ``Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel'' were part of
a series Groucho and Chico Marx made for Standard Oil but which
were never recorded, Maggs said
   He said the scripts were subsequently filed away and were
thought to have been lost until Barson discovered them and realized
their importance.
   Fans of the Marx Brothers stood in line in the rain outside the
studio before the show to make sure of getting a seat.
   The BBC filmed the show and will broadcast it later this year,
Maggs said.
   Groucho was played by Mike Roberts, complete with mustache and
big cigar, Groucho's trademarks. Frank Lazarus played Chico.
   Maggs said: ``The great thing about the scripts is that many of
the incredible sketches and gags which they later did in their
movies are here in an earlier form and you can see how they
developed their ideas.
   ``They have never been heard since they were first produced and
finding the scripts was like finding Tutankhamen's tomb.''
   In the scripts, the Groucho character Flywheel is an
unscrupulous lawyer and Chico is his even more unscrupulous
assistant, Ravelli.

   The cover of the new Bradford telephone directory
is a hit with art lovers, but many locals are less than
enthusiastic about artist David Hockney's colorful, childlike
painting of the city where he was born.
   Some Bradfordians prefer the previous edition's picture-postcard
views of the cathedral, castle and surrounding moors, and they have
been venting their irritation in letters to the press.
   ``The letters are all of the same ilk... `My grandchild could do
a similar job','' said Malcolm Hoddy, editor of the West Yorkshire
Telegraph and Argus.
   For instance, Vera G. Taylor wrote: ``What an insult to print
this outrageous piece of so-called art on our telephone directory.
   ``Who do they think they are kidding? Not me! I have seen better
drawings in our local first schools.''
   Hoddy admits he would not recognize his hometown from Hockney's
painting, but he has little time for the critics.
   ``Whenever Hockney paints anything that makes any kind of news,
you get the same people writing in,'' Hoddy said. ``They're the
same ones who are wondering why Picasso put an eye under an armpit.
   ``But what a lot of people tend to forget is that Hockney did
this for no charge. It's not costing anybody anything, and they're
getting a phone book with a Hockney picture on it under the door
for free,'' Hoddy said.
   Hockney's supporters point out that the painter not only is a
living rebuttal of Yorkshire's reputation for low-brow dourness,
but he has stayed in touch with Bradford despite having lived in
Los Angeles for 25 years.
   The 51-year-old artist has participated in other civic projects;
designing the cover for a handbook for the disabled, and a
``Bradford's Bouncing Back'' poster for a campaign to invigorate
the industrial city of 460,000 people.
   The phone company, British Telecom, printed 295,000 copies of
the book to meet the needs of Bradford and surrounding places like
Blubberhouses, Horton-in-Ribblesdale and Haworth, the hometown of
the Bronte sisters.
   But British Telecom anticipated outside interest and printed an
extra 5,000 copies, said spokeswoman Anne Crawther.
   ``We've received requests from people in Dallas, Seattle, Geneva
and Germany,'' she said.
   She said 50 copies were being sent to Hockney, and a London
collector has bought 500 volumes at $6 each. Hockney has retained
the original painting and rights to its use, Ms. Crawther said.
   Hockney originals now fetch more than $1 million, but art expert
John Kasmin doubted the phone book would appreciate in value.
   ``If people are buying the phone book because they think it will
be worth something, I should think they are misguided,'' Kasmin
said.

   The Pentagon's plan to close or scale back 72 U.S. military
installations has riled officials in large cities and small towns.
Targeted communities nationwide are mobilizing to ``fight like the
dickens'' to avoid the cuts.
   California would be the hardest hit under Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's proposal, with 10 bases employing more than 35,000
servicemen and 22,000 civilian workers slated for closure or
reductions.
   But the closings also would hit hard in communities such as
Charlestown, Ind., a southern Indiana town of 5,700 where the
Defense Department plans to mothball a munitions plant and lay off
about 900 workers.
   In announcing his $292.1 billion fiscal 1991 spending plan
Monday, Cheney called for Congress to ``have the guts'' to make
tough decisions about closing military bases.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, home from a
three-nation trip, is proclaiming a bright future for Panama even
as some nations in the region refuse to recognize its
U.S.-installed government.
   Jamaica underscored its refusal Monday on the last stop of
Quayle's three-day trip.
   Quayle later said he gave President Bush a ``very upbeat''
report on his visit to Honduras, Panama and Jamaica during a
telephone call on Monday, and planned to brief him in full today.
   However, the vice president acknowledged that while the United
States is pressing for other Central American countries to
recognize the government of President Guillermo Endara, Jamaica and
Venezuela are insisting that elections be held there to legitimize
Endara first.

   Prosecutors have a second witness to
corroborate the testimony of a convicted drug dealer who claims he
sold crack cocaine to Mayor Marion Barry and smoked it with him,
law enforcement sources say.
   James McWilliams, a longtime friend of convicted drug dealer
Charles Lewis, will plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of aiding
and abetting a drug sale and will cooperate with the investigation
of Barry's ties to Lewis, a law enforcement source said Monday.
   Barry, who has denied using drugs, was arrested in an FBI sting
operation on Jan. 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge for
allegedly smoking crack in a Washington hotel room. He is in a
private facility in Florida for what an aide says is primarily
treatment of alcoholism.
   McWilliams, a motor vehicles department employee, is expected to
appear before a grand jury investigating Barry's ties to Lewis,
according to the law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.

   Researchers unveiled a prototype computer
that uses light instead of electrical impulses to process data, and
said it could be as revolutionary as the transistor that ushered in
the computer age.
   The computer processor that Bell Laboratories displayed Monday
was crude, with enough power only to operate something like a
dishwasher. Within a decade, however, it could lead to development
of light-based supercomputers operating at least 100 times faster
than current machines, said Alan Huang, head of Bell Labs' optical
computer research department.
   ``This stage says it can be done,'' said Bob Trier, technical
program director for Research Consortium Inc. of Minneapolis, which
studies high-performance computing. ``The next stage is to find out
what can be done with this technology.''
   For years, researchers have been looking at photons, the
fundamental particles of light, as replacements for electrons in
electronic equipment. Such a shift promises computers vastly more
agile and powerful than today's machines.

   While most of Beijing settles down for an evening
of TV, a small segment is out on the town singing.
   Restaurants that dish out food in daylight turn into sing-along
clubs called ``karaoke'' after sundown and have brought a little
life to Beijing's otherwise dull nights.
   ``There's not much to do in Beijing at night, ...'' said hotel
worker Qiu Jingshi, 20, between songs at the Yanhai Restaurant.
``But here, we can listen to music, dance and sing karaoke. I do
songs by singers from Taiwan and China, not in English because I
don't understand the words.''
   He was one of about 60 young people who paid $4.20 each one
recent night to sing along at the Yanhai, which provides
soundtracks of well-known songs from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. nightly and
until 5 a.m. Saturdays.
   The Yanhai has a repertoire of songs in Chinese, and 364 English
titles including tunes from Elvis Presley, Neil Sedaka and Perry
Como to the Monkees, Madonna and Janet Jackson. Old favorites range
from ``Three Blind Mice'' and ``Havah Nagila'' to ``Moon River''
and ``Rock Around the Clock.''
   In the dim light, a couple sing a duet of ``Tennessee Waltz.'' A
young man sings a Chinese song; later people dance to taped music.
   ``My friends told me it was a lot of fun, so I came to try it
out,'' said Qi Hong, a 21-year-old coed. ``I can sing two songs in
English: `River of No Return' and `Love Story'.''
   Zhang Liang works nightly as a singer at the Mingxing
Restaurant, a bright oasis of gaudy neon lights on a quiet Beijing
back street. The 20-year-old bartender-by-day was hired to sing
twice a night at the Mingxing to lend atmosphere and encourage
timid Chinese vocalists to sing along with him.
   ``If things slow down, I'll come out and sing again,'' he says.
With his flowing hair and acid-washed denim jacket with stainless
steel studs, Zhang cuts a striking figure on the spotlighted stage
as he belts out numbers in Mandarin and Cantonese.
   Nowhere are there foreigners, who usually go to more expensive
bars and discos in joint-venture hotels reserved for them and often
are barred from Chinese night spots.
   Zhang earns $6.40 a night, working from 9 p.m. to midnight. He
loves dancing, especially ``pili-wu'' (breakdancing) and, like most
Chinese his age, is a fan of Michael Jackson.
   ``I watch videos of the American Grammy awards every year,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Bush's Family Savings Plan: Success or Failure?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In proposing an inducement to saving, President
Bush is seeking to uproot what has become an American tradition,
one of living for the moment, of living in debt, of borrowing from
the future.
   It is a pervasive habit, one so common you might say
``everyone'' does it _ Uncle Sam, corporations, households, and
students who used to work their way through college. Lender or
borrower, they're all hooked on debt.
   Insidiously, debt to support further spending tends to entrap,
forcing the user to borrow again and again. Interest costs, for
example, are one of the reasons Uncle Sam runs a budget deficit. He
has to borrow to pay them.
   Once people try debt they seem to like it, and they'll go to any
extreme to justify it.
   Corporations issue junk bonds that endanger their futures. Uncle
Sam seeks budget balance by shoving items off the budget sheets.
   That's still not enough for many households. They commit what
used to be thought of as a mortal sin, mortgaging the roof over
their heads by taking out an equity loan. Many go further,
borrowing on their insurance policies.
   There's a peddlar, a pusher on every corner.
   Banks that should know better offer cards and credit lines to
strangers. Wall Street packages debt and sells it as securities.
The media glamorize extravagance. Publishers push books on
borrowing your way to wealth.
   And now, President Bush wants individual Americans to just say
no. His proposal is this: a new ``family savings plan'' that would
allow interest to accumulate free of income taxes.
   Under the proposal, couples could set aside $5,000 and
individuals $2,500 a year and avoid any income tax on interest
earned if the money remained in the account for at least seven
years.
   Can the proposal encourage people to save? Maybe. Much depends
on economic conditions.
   A high or rising inflation rate could endanger it, first by
encouraging spending in advance of higher prices, secondly by
undermining real returns. High inflation also could force
households to cash out for living expenses.
   It also would require faith by savers. History shows that to
some extent tax laws are changed every year. Tax benefits of IRAs,
or Individual Retirement Accounts, for example, were reduced after
a few years.
   Of course, if people already are living to the full extent of
their incomes, and beyond, they might not have money to put away.
   Can it really change the general attitude toward borrowing and
saving?
   It could be a start, if combined with other proposals, such as
the president's idea of lowering capital gains taxes for
investments held three years or longer, but the habit of borrowing
rather than saving is imbedded.
   Bush certainly can make a beginning. Similarly ``impossible''
feats have been performed. A decade ago, for instance, some of the
best minds in finance said single-digit home mortgages rates never
would be seen again. How wrong!
   In seeking change, Bush has some things going for him:
   _Even stronger than the urge to save or spend might be the urge
to avoid taxes. A decade ago all consumer interest was tax
deductible. A gradual phasing out brings the deductible this year
to just 10 percent of the total.
   Thus, one of the main inducements to borrowing has been or will
be removed.
   _America is older. One reason for high borrowing and low savings
was the population's age. There was a bulge of people age 20 years
to 35 years, the big-spending years. That bulge is moving up in
age, its big spending behind it.
   _The pressure is growing on Uncle Sam to reduce his own spending
ways. There has been some success, and maybe more to come. If so,
Uncle Sam might be the perfect role model.

   Stiltsville is on its last legs. The cluster of
rustic vacation homes rising out of Florida's Biscayne Bay will
have to come down by the turn of the century, by decree of the
government. For people like Thatcher Edmunds, it will be a paradise
lost.

<DATELINE>BISCAYNE NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thatcher Edmunds recalls
back in the early 1960s when the stilt structures dotting the flats
of Biscayne Bay were notorious hangouts for gamblers, boozers and
flashy women.
   Characters such as Plucky Pierre and his right-hand man,
Shipwreck Kelly, ran a joint called The Bikini Club, where a pink
card gained entry for members any time of day or night.
   Seamen found their way to the Quarterdeck Club, which was fully
equipped with a bar, table games, and, for a time, slot machines.
   ``Ours, though, was strictly for family,'' says Edmunds, who
calls his dwelling on stilts the ``A house.''
   So-named because of its distinctive A-frame architecture, the
faded yellow retreat sits in several feet of water along with 13
other such vacation homes and weekend retreats off the southern
coast of Key Biscayne.
   Pleasure boaters cruising Biscayne Bay can hardly miss the stilt
homes that have become a veritable Miami landmark.
   Curious Miamians and visitors alike pass through Stiltsville's
natural deep-water channels en route to the ocean and sometimes
leave slashes in the sea grasses after dragging their engines on
the bay bottom in the clear, shallow water around the homes.
   But even with its reputation considerably mellowed and more
family oriented, Stiltsville will no longer exist at the turn of
the century.
   Residents' leases for quarter-acre underwater sites won't be
renewed after July 1, 1999, by decree of the Florida Cabinet. The
state allowed the bay bottom to be leased through the next decade
but prohibited new construction after the Legislature passed the
Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve Act in 1974.
   ``We are taking this area, which is close to a large urban area,
and returning it to its natural state,'' says Lisa Garvin,
spokeswoman for the 173,000-acre Biscayne National Park.
   Although some people have called Stiltsville an eyesore and
environmental concerns have been raised, Edmunds and others say the
homes should be saved.
   ``Maybe they're jealous because they can't build,'' Edmunds
says. ``We were there long before it was a national park. We're not
bothering anyone.''
   Edmunds, 61, a retired trucking company supervisor from Pembroke
Pines, shares the retreat with three other families. The 40-by
50-foot, three-bedroom house, about six miles offshore from Miami
and a mile from the Cape Florida lighthouse, has stood for 27
years. Hurricane Donna leveled the original structure.
   Residents now can rebuild homes damaged during storms only if at
least 51 percent of the structure remains intact.
   It took about a year for the families to build the A-frame house
themselves, towing scrap lumber and materials to the site in small
outboards.
   ``It was almost like homesteading,'' Edmunds says.
   In 1965, he says, Ivan Tors Studios featured the house as the
base of operations for an underwater coal mining company in the
movie ``Round the World Under the Sea.'' Church groups and Boy
Scouts also have borrowed the place for special retreats.
   Don't expect any luxuries here, Edmunds says, though it's the
best getaway possible still within sight of the Miami skyline.
   ``You never run out of things to do _ relax, fish, water-ski,
dive, or watch the boats go by,'' he says.
   There is no television, no telephone. They catch rainwater for
showers and washing dishes. Generators provide electricity, and the
breeze off the bay provides ``the world's best air conditioning,''
Edmunds says as he throws open the wooden doors off the combination
sitting room-kitchen-dining area.
   The bay, its water patches of light green and indigo blue, used
to offer some of the best bonefishing anywhere before Miami's
population boomed, Edmunds says. But despite the decline in marine
life, it's still easy to catch a panful of fish for supper.
   ``You can cast off the porch any time you want and catch all the
fish you want,'' Edmunds says.
   Old pictures from family outings cram a large bulletin board
inside the wooden house, many of them showing bloody sharks bigger
than the young boys who caught them.
   Over the course of about 60 years, residents of Stiltsville have
often helped boaters who became stranded or got caught in a bad
storm.
   ``Through the years I can't imagine how many I've pulled off the
flats or helped them repair their boats or towed them in,'' Edmunds
says.
   Residents pay the state Department of Natural Resources $1,000
annually to lease the site. When the first structures began shaping
Stiltsville, the bay bottom was leased for $1 an acre. The
community peaked after World War II, with some 20 residences.
   Today, some of the structures have fallen into disrepair after
years of constant exposure to wind and salt spray.
   Edmunds says it's a constant battle to keep up his retreat,
replacing beams, painting and making repairs. He worries about
Stiltsville's possible deterioration in the next decade because
owners may decide it's not worth spending the money for repairs if
they'll have to move or tear down the residences.
   If the state remains committed to eliminating Stiltsville,
Edmunds says, it'll do more than just take away a slice of paradise
for owners in the area.
   ``It'll take away a lot of pleasure for people who visit,'' he
says. ``It's just the neatest place in the world.''

   A prosecutor investigating the deaths of eight
followers of a housewife-turned-guru over the last 12 years is
trying to piece together a criminal case with a hard-to-prove
premise: that beliefs can kill.
   Four followers of mystical leader Terri Hoffman have committed
suicide, including two of her four husbands, and two died in
apparent accidents. Of those six, two told relatives they suffered
from terminal illnesses, although autopsies showed they did not,
and at least four bequeathed money and property to Ms. Hoffman.
   Then, in November, police linked the deaths of an investment
counselor and his wife to Ms. Hoffman's pastiche of philosophy,
ancient mythology and metaphysics.
   David and Glenda Goodman were found shot to death in their den,
two handguns beside them on the floor. On a desk a few feet away
lay two purple spiral-bound notebooks in which they recorded their
devotion to Ms. Hoffman.
   In one book, Mrs. Goodman called ``the shooting'' the path to
success and an escape from the sufferings of the physical world.
Soon, she wrote to her husband, he would be able to come and go
from the physical world at will, just as, she said, ``Terri'' can.
   The journals tell more: how the Goodmans, both 48, were
considering leaving their home to Ms. Hoffman. Their check
registers indicated they'd already given her $110,000 over three
years, police say.
   In addition to the deaths of the eight devotees, a ninth person,
a housekeeper, died when the car of one follower plunged off a
Colorado cliff.
   Assistant District Attorney Cecil Emerson said he's trying to
determine whether ``mind control'' can be legally blamed for
contributing to a death, which might require breaking new legal
ground.
   ``It's never entered anyone's mind that you could put together a
case like this,'' Emerson said. ``I'm confident we can.''
   Still, he conceded it would be a long time before he could put
the case before a grand jury _ if it even gets that far.
   ``The theme of this investigation is murder,'' he said. ``The
reality is probably theft.''
   So far, investigators have gathered mostly autopsy reports, the
files of police investigations into the accidents and the financial
records of some of those who died.
   No criminal action has been taken against Ms. Hoffman, but two
lawsuits have been filed against her.
   In 1982, the brother of follower Sandra Cleaver contested her
will leaving everything to Ms. Hoffman, including a $300,000 life
insurance policy and a house. Six days after the case went to
trial, Ms. Hoffman and Ms. Cleaver's brother agreed out of court to
split the estate.
   She faces a civil trial in March stemming from a wrongful death
suit brought by the children of her fourth husband, Don Hoffman,
who killed himself in September 1988.
   Ms. Hoffman's attorney, Fred Time, said she is being persecuted.
   ``It's witch hunting,'' Time said. ``She's supposed to have all
these tremendous powers _ ridiculous. There's no history of that
anywhere in the world.''
   He said the suit and investigation would clear Ms. Hoffman, 51,
who he described as a ``plain, ordinary person who gets money by
counseling people.''
   How does he explain the number of deaths among her followers?
   ``She listens to people who are in extremely transient stages of
their life,'' Time said.
   Ms. Hoffman told The Associated Press she would answer questions
only in the presence of Time, who said he would not allow her to
speak to reporters while an investigation was pending.
   Ms. Hoffman became known in Dallas in the late 1960s and early
'70s for her meditation classes, a blend of mythology and
metaphysics in which ``masters'' were said to be reached.
   ``A Master is a high, evolved being who has great wisdom,'' she
told The Monthly Aspectarian last year. She described for the
Chicago-based magazine her first experience with ``masters,'' which
took place at age 3, saying, ``They explained to me that they were
beings that sometimes helped people that are in physical bodies or
other bodies, and they come to teach them.''
   In 1974, Ms. Hoffman founded Conscious Development of Body, Mind
&amp; Soul Inc. to sell tapes and booklets of her teachings. She sold
thousands, Time said, and attracted hundreds of followers.
   David Goodman became one of them in the early '70s. He met Ms.
Hoffman at Dallas' Southern Methodist University, where he was a
business professor and she was teaching a meditation class, Emerson
said.
   Ms. Hoffman counseled Goodman during his first divorce, they
became friends and, years later, made business investments together.
   When Ms. Hoffman was sued by Ms. Cleaver's brother, Goodman
testified on her behalf. And when he left SMU in 1987, she helped
him start an investment newsletter.
   Goodman married and divorced twice more before he met his fourth
wife, Glenda, also a devotee. They continued to adhere to Ms.
Hoffman's teachings years after most followers abandoned them.
   Ms. Hoffman's classes began to dissipate in 1977 after the
suicide of her second husband, Glenn Cooley. Some followers have
said they became wary as Ms. Hoffman's meditations and spiritual
sessions focused less on learning than on fighting ``evil'' forces.
   Cooley killed himself less than a week after the couple's
divorce became final, the first of the nine deaths police now are
investigating.
   In 1979, Devereaux Cleaver, the 14-year-old daughter of Sandra
Cleaver, drowned rafting in Hawaii. Two years later, Ms. Cleaver
and her housekeeper, who did not follow Ms. Hoffman's teachings,
died in a car that tumbled off a Colorado cliff near land owned by
some devotees.
   In 1987, another follower, Robin Otstott, shot herself after
telling people she had viral hepatitis. Like Don Hoffman, who said
he had cancer when he took a drug overdose, an autopsy showed Ms.
Otstott did not have the disease she claimed.
   A Chicago follower of Ms. Hoffman, Mary Levinson, also killed
herself in 1987. Just weeks before, she changed her will to dispose
of her estate, valued at more than $125,000, in a manner that could
not be traced, her parents told The Dallas Morning News. Ms.
Hoffman told the newspaper she did not receive any money from Ms.
Levinson, but would not answer other questions.
   Ms. Hoffman was a beneficiary in both her husbands' wills, as
well as in Ms. Cleaver's and Ms. Otstott's, Time confirmed.
   Police have not found a will for the Goodmans, but their
journals indicate they considered deeding their house to Ms.
Hoffman.
   Those writings also suggest they were concerned about tax
problems. Goodman lost money in a Dallas investment company whose
leaders were convicted of tax fraud last year, Emerson said. Though
Goodman was not implicated in any criminal activity, he lost
thousands of dollars in the company's illegal shelters. In 1988, he
reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service to retire a
tax debt estimated at more than $300,000, the Morning News
reported. The IRS declined to release details of the case.
   Goodman's father said the couple broke off contact with
relatives and many friends in 1989.
   ``We had a fine, loving relationship up until then,'' said
Leonard Goodman, 74, of Santa Maria, Calif. ``Something very
unusual _ it turned out very tragic _ happened to break that
relationship.''

   He said he would not elaborate while the deaths were under
investigation.
   The Goodmans' two purple notebooks contain some of the strongest
evidence investigators have linking them to Ms. Hoffman.
   On page after page, David Goodman, calling himself Jupiter after
the Roman god, asks questions of Glenda, addressed as Venus, about
their quest to ``leave the physical.''
   In one passage, Mrs. Goodman, apparently writing as a god
speaking to both her mortal self and her husband, said: ``Just like
with the shooting. If you do that, I can make you both a success.
That is, can make you yourself. Your spirit.''
   In another passage, Goodman asks about suffering and his wife
responds with an apparent reference to Ms. Hoffman:
   ``Terri in the physical has also suffered. ... Her advantage is
that she is able to leave the physical, although not at any moment
she chooses. In time you both as well as Terri will be able to come
and go freely at will.
   ``She is anxious for that day as you are.''

<TEXT>
   Returning to his bad-guy beginnings, Richard
Gere is back in the movie fast lane after a lapse that had
Hollywood wondering if he was more interested in causes than an
acting career.
   Gere crashed onto the movie scene in 1977 as one of Diane
Keaton's sleazy boyfriends in ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar.'' It was a
small part and helped get him the lead as the male prostitute in
the seamy ``American Gigolo'' in 1980.
   He soon became a top leading man, most notably in the 1982 hit
``An Officer and a Gentleman.'' A few bombs followed, then a long
absence from the screen. He seemed to be devoting all his energies
to alerting the public to the longtime Chinese repression in Tibet.
   Now Gere has returned to the movie bigtime in Paramount
Picture's ``Internal Affairs,'' starring as a crooked cop. The film
received mixed reviews from critics, but has found favor with
audiences, earning $11 million in two weeks.
   Gere next appears in a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts,
``Pretty Woman,'' for Touchstone Pictures.
   ``Internal Affairs'' casts Gere as Dennis Peck, a veteran Los
Angeles street cop who has become an expert in extortion and
murder-for-hire. Andy Garcia is the detective who investigates him.
Peck is a thorough sleaze and misogynist, but Gere doesn't see him
that way.
   ``He doesn't think he's bad. You know, this was a very tough
script. It was a very disturbing read, as well as to see it. I had
to really look into it to see what was so disturbing and what was
worthwhile about the film,'' Gere said.
   ``I realized that it was similar to Iago and Othello. It was
that kind of evil: the evil of Iago. In Peck's case it was the same
as Othello; it was jealousy that he pinpoints.
   ``The more I looked into him, the more I saw of this incredible
megalomaniac control _ not the small kind that we have in most of
our lives, but an extraordinary kind of octopus of arms and
tentacles going out in all directions. He had five wives and ten
kids, and he controlled these families as well as the police
department. But on the other hand, he did not need to be more than
a foot soldier.''
   Gere plays his own age, 40, graying hair and all. He sounds like
an old-timer when he comments about co-star Garcia: ``I saw in him
_ he's in his early 30s _ a lot of myself when I was his age. I had
the same level of intensity that he's coming from.''
   He added with a grin: ``I keep telling them I can play 18 but
they don't believe me. (Age) doesn't bother me either way. There
are a couple of films I'm developing that would be aging movies,
from the late 20s into the 50s. Certainly playing the younger of
those characters I would dye my hair.''
   Throughout his career, Gere has never been comfortable with
interviews. But he seemed more at ease when he was recently here to
promote ``Internal Affairs.'' Except for the little-seen ``Miles
From Home,'' he has been absent from the big screen for three
years. During much of that time he devoted himself to the cause of
his longtime friend, the Dalai Lama. The actor helped establish
Tibet House New York, aimed at preserving the country's heritage.
   Two events last year helped bring Tibet's plight to the world's
attention, he said, citing the massacre during pro-democracy
protests by Chinese students in Tiananmen Square, and the awarding
of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama _ Gere attended the
presentation ceremonies in Oslo, Norway.
   He said Tiananmen Square was ``perhaps 10 percent of what the
Chinese have been doing every day in Tibet for 35 years.''
   Gere was born in Philadelphia and grew up on a farm near
Syracuse, N.Y. He remembers his debut as an actor: ``My first role
was Santa Claus in the second grade. My mother made the costume
herself, which she still reminds me of. In high school I played the
president of the United States, and the entire audience of my peers
started howling that Dick Gere was playing the president.
   ``At 19 I left college (University of Massachusetts), thinking I
had done nothing with my life. That's when I went into repertory.''
   After work at the Provincetown Playhouse and the Seattle
Repertory Theater, he played off-Broadway roles and Danny Zuko in
the New York and London companies of ``Grease.'' His film debut
came in Terence Malick's ``Days of Heaven.'' He also co-starred in
the Broadway production of ``Bent'' after ``American Gigolo.''
   A series of mishaps _ ``Breathless,'' ``Beyond the Limits,''
``The Cotton Club,'' ``King David,'' ``Power,'' ``No Mercy'' _
spelled trouble for Gere's career. But like John Travolta with
``Look Who's Talking,'' he appears on the rebound.
   Of his recent absence, he said: ``It wasn't the wisest thing in
the world, but I'm in this for the rest of my life. As long as I
can keep growing as an individual, the career will take care of
itself.''

   President Bush sent Congress a $1.23 trillion
budget for fiscal 1991 that keeps new spending below inflation and
recognizes ``remarkable changes'' in the world by scaling back
defense and rewarding emerging democracies.
   Bush called the spending plan an ``investment in the future.''
But Democratic leaders in Congress pounced on it Monday as a
``standpat budget'' and challenged its claim to halve the federal

Americans' savings rate by cutting taxes on capital gains and
allowing families to earn tax-free interest on long-term savings
accounts.
   His fiscal 1991 budget plan disclosed Monday recommends $15.7
billion worth of tax increases, but no general boost in income
taxes, and a $5.6 billion increase in user and service fees.
   At the same time, Bush proposed $1.8 billion in tax reductions
in addition to the capital-gains cut, including a new credit of up
to $1,000 a year for each child under age 4 in low-income families.

   The Bush administration proposed increasing
fees on securities and futures transactions to help fund higher
spending by the federal agencies that regulate both industries.
   The government's fiscal year 1991 budget, released Monday, calls
for a $47 million funding increase for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the independent agency that regulates the nation's
stock and bond markets.
   The budget also seeks an 11-cent-per-transaction fee on futures
trades to cover the expenses of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which oversees the nation's futures markets.
   Spokesmen for both the Securities Industry Association and the
Futures Industry Association were not in their office when called
for comment late Monday.
   The $1.23 trillion budget proposal seeks to increase the SEC's
annual funding to $186.6 million, an increase of 34 percent or $47
million over outlays for 1990. Spending for the CFTC would increase
by about $7.7 million, or 21 percent, to $44.5 million.
   The budget plan for the SEC noted that a temporary increase in
securities registration fees beginning July 1 is expected to raise
nearly $22.9 million, ``which is to be counted as offsetting
receipts.'' That is, the amount would go toward funding the SEC's
$139.5 million outlay for fiscal year 1990.
   All securities offered for sale to the public must be registered
with the SEC, whose main mission is to protect the investing
public. The SEC is not self-funding, although it collects nearly
twice as much in fees than it is allocated in the budget.
   In addition to calling for making the registration fee increase
permanent, the Bush administration plans to seek legislation to
raise fees charged for all transactions on a securities exchange,
for all mergers and proxy votes, and to extend the fee increase to
securities traded over the counter that qualify for trading in a
national market system.
   The budget proposal projected that those fee increases, if
approved by Congress, would generate $80.1 million for the
government in fiscal year 1991.
   The plan's 11-cent futures transaction fee, beginning Oct. 1,
would cover additional expenses for the CFTC. Those expenses would
include stepped up market surveillance and investigations called
for by Congress in the wake of indictments at the nation's
two-largest futures exchanges in Chicago last summer.

<TEXT>
   A Caribbean island retreat for
chemically dependant professionals aims to let well-heeled clients
kick the habit in style _ and in anonymity.
   ``We take it further than just explaining the disease and saying
`abstain.' We teach people to enjoy life,'' said Karen Ann Crissy,
president of the Ft. Lauderdale-based Caribbean Retreat Inc.
   ``It's more like a Club Med with a therapeutic focus.''
   The 20-acre island is fully booked for the first 21-day session
of therapy, sports and recreation, which starts next month, she
said.
   The cost of treatment, which includes transportation to the
island by private air charter, is $15,000. The retreat's program
will focus on stress management and is based on therapies offered
by Alcoholics Anonymous, Crissy said.
   Crissy and two other investors bought the tropical island for
about $1 million from a New York syndication of companies that used
it for corporate vacations.
   Clients must be drug- or alcohol-free for 30 days and in good
health before being accepted for treatment, she said.
   Both clients and staff must sign an agreement to keep the
island's name and locale confidential.
   To further protect clients' confidentiality, Crissy said the
program will not do any third-party billing, so it will not be
recorded on medical records or be covered by insurance.
   ``We stress anonymity, seclusion and privacy,'' she said. ``We
want to protect the people who are going there.''
   Caribbean Retreat features a program of individual and group
therapy that promotes healing through a mix of metaphysics,
meditation, philosophy and physical activity. Crissy said she has
hired psychologists, sports coaches and hypnotists to work with her
clients.
   She is marketing her recovery center to the directors of
corporate employee assistance programs. Since those programs are
confidential, they can pass the information along to employees in
need.
   One such program director said he is not sure if it's a good
idea to send someone with a drug or alcohol problem to an island
retreat.
   Paul Heck, director of the employee assistance program at J.C.
Penney Co. near Dallas, said the geographic isolation could make
some families feel left out of the recovery process, and addicts
could see the retreat trip as a chance to escape problems at home.
   ``This is a guy who lives for the job, comes home and is an
absent husband,'' said Heck. ``Now he is off on a Caribbean island
and we're supposed to be happy.''
   Nevertheless, the retreat's seclusion could be attractive to
some, Heck said.
   ``For many people, it would be worth the money to keep it
confidential.''

<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp., which has suffered
heavy real estate losses and watched depositors withdraw millions
of dollars, says it will raise $828 million by selling its credit
card business to Citicorp.
   ``We are very pleased to announce the completion of this
important step in our asset sales strategy,'' H. Ridgely Bullock,
the bank's interim chairman, said in a statement Monday. ``We are
right on track with our strategic plan.''
   Bullock was named interim chairman last week after the board
forced out the previous chairman, Walter Connolly.
   Bank of New England announced earlier this month it was trying
to sell $6 billion worth of assets because it expected to post a
loss of more than $1 billion in 1989 because of bad real estate
loans.
   The bank said it expected to make a profit of about $176 million
from selling the credit card business. Analysts said the ability to
raise more than $800 million in cash was more important.
   ``This relieves some of the funding pressure on them,'' said
Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. ``It
gives them a little more breathing room.''
   The bank last week had to borrow money from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston as small and large depositors withdrew millions of
dollars.
   Bank and federal officials have not confirmed the amount
borrowed, but it was believed to be around $450 million.
   The sale of the credit card business must be approved by banking
regulators. Tom Lavelle, a bank spokesman, said approval normally
would take about a month, but both Bank of New England and Citicorp
are trying to get the deal cleared ``in short order.''

<HEAD>The National, Daily Sports Paper, Debuts Wednesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National, the all-sports newspaper that
debuts Wednesday in three big cities, is going to test the American
appetite for sports with 30-plus pages of stories, analysis, color
photos and slickly presented statistics six days a week.
   Publisher Peter O. Price and his old college buddy, Frank
Deford, are going to give readers ``a regular diet'' of what Price
says most men buy their hometown daily newspaper for _ sports
coverage.
   Deford, the former Sports Illustrated writer, is the editor in
charge of a 125-person editorial staff. Price says the owners have
the patience _ and the money _ to give the new tabloid whatever
time is needed to succeed.
   Wednesday's launch in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago is
expected to cost $25 million. The paper will be published Sunday
through Friday and cost 50 cents a copy. It will be available at
first only at newstands and machines.
   The National is being backed by Emilio Azcarraga, a
publicity-shy media baron from Mexico who is a major exporter of
Spanish-language TV programming. Azcarraga is the lead member of a
partnership that includes Price and others and is prepared, Price
said, to spend $100 million to make it profitable.
   The National will offer a core of national sports coverage
including columns, investigations, gossip and cartoons. Each city's
issue will have expanded coverage of its local teams.
   Plans are to expand gradually into other major cities such as
Detroit, Dallas, Philadelphia, Boston and San Francisco, with a
target of being in 15 cities by the end of 1990.
   The launch comes at a treacherous economic juncture. Forecasters
are divided on whether a recession looms ahead, national ad
spending has been sluggish and competition among media outlets for
ads has never been fiercer.
   In addition, the paper faces the longer-term test of winning
over a national audience.
   John Morton, newspaper analyst for the investment firm Lynch,
Jones &amp; Ryan, notes the country has seldom supported national
newspapers. He said one of the few successes, Gannett Co. Inc.'s
USA Today, already provides considerable sports information.
   Local papers, on the other hand, can easily expand their sports
coverage if they sense a threat from the new national sports daily,
he said.
   The key issue facing The National, Morton said, is this: ``Is
there that much interest in spectator sports news on a daily
basis?''
   Price said the success of all-sports programming on cable
television has demonstrated a hearty U.S. appetite for sports. A
former publisher of the New York Post, Price said readers will buy
The National in addition to their local paper.
   The National's ad sales director, Peter A. Spina, said
discounted advertising sales are ahead of projections with almost
1,200 pages of ads ordered before the launh, surpassing an initial
goal of 1,000. Advertisers include Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Philip
Morris Cos. and General Motors Corp.
   The newspaper is counting heavily on circulation for revenue, at
least at the start. The initial target is average daily circulation
of 200,000.
   ``Readers can expect the best-written and best-looking newspaper
in the country,'' said Deford, who quit Sports Illustrated to take
the editor's job and hired big-name columnists like Mike Lupica of
the New York Daily News and Scott Ostler of the Los Angeles Times.
   Each day's paper will run 32 to 48 tabloid-sized pages with a
minimum of 30 pages of editorial material and color photography,
Deford said.
   Price said the venture is expected to reach the break-even point
in five years, which would be something of a feat given that USA
Today expects to make its first yearly profit in 1990 after losing
$800 million over seven years.
   ``Putting out a national newspaper is an extraordinarily costly
endeavor,'' said USA Today President Thomas Curley, adding that it
would be difficult to contain losses for a national startup to $100
million.
   Some industry analysts expect The National will compete for
readers with USA Today. One of USA Today's drawing cards has been
getting West Coast scores into the papers distributed on the East
Coast.
   Price said The National will ``be comparable to most of the
papers'' in terms of getting late scores into the New York and
Chicago editions. But he said that for the first month, only one
edition will be printed for those two cities and the deadline will
be between 12:30 a.m. and 1 a.m. EST.
   Despite the competition in the field, many observers of the
publishing industry say they hope the paper makes it.
   ``We are usually very skeptical about things like this, but I
think this one has a better than average chance to succeed,'' said
Jack Irving, director of media operations at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising.
   He said many countries have national sports dailies and the
United States may be ready for one as well; the financing appears
solid and Price and Deford are experienced. ``I look at it fairly
positively,'' he said.

<HEAD>US Sprint To Offer Voice-Activated Dialing</HEAD>

   Harried business travelers weighed down
with suitcases and overcoats will soon be able to let their voice
do the dialing on long-distance calls, US Sprint said.
   The nation's third-largest long-distance company on Monday
announced it would offer the first voice-activated dialing service
sometime between April and June to customers in selected markets.
   The service would allow a caller to say his name and a password
instead of using Sprint's long-distance travel card, which requires
a caller to punch in as many as 24 digits.
   In addition, the caller could speed-dial certain pre-registered
numbers by barking orders such as ``call home'' into a phone.
   ``These are the features the traveling public tells us they
want,'' said Syd Courson, spokesman for Kansas City-based Sprint.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. said it has the technology to
offer similar voice-activated services and is conducting trials to
determine what features customers want. AT&amp;T spokeswoman Fran
Anderson said some products could be announced in 1990.
   ``There's lots of technology out there,'' Anderson said. ``The
real test now is applying it to what customers need.''
   A spokesman for MCI Communications Corp., the nation's
second-largest long-distance company, said his company is studying
voice-activated calling but has no plans to introduce a service.
   ``We don't feel the technology is ready to roll out,'' spokesman
Joe McNamara said in St. Louis.
   Sprint said its new system, aimed at business travelers, would
guard against unauthorized use of calling cards by ensuring the
caller's voice matched a pre-registered voice pattern.
   The system is designed to adapt to slight changes in a caller's
voice over time, although there are some limits.
   ``Puberty might be a problem,'' Courson said.
   Also, the caller might have to punch in a code number if he or
she had a bad cold or laryngitis, Courson said.
   The new Sprint system would not totally eliminate punching in
numbers, Courson said. A caller would have to dial an 800 number to
gain access to the voice-activated network before doing the rest of
the dialing by voice.
   The Sprint system also would allow callers to leave voice
messages at numbers that are busy or go unanswered. AT&amp;T earlier
this month announced a similar system using an 800 number, called
VoiceMark messaging and currently available only in Atlanta.
   Courson said several hundred thousand customers could use the
new Sprint system by early summer, but he would not specify what
markets would get it first, or its price.
   Testing on the system began in December 1988, said Larry Lake,
senior vice president of product management. The company unveiled
the service Sunday in commercials broadcast during the Super Bowl.
   US Sprint, which controls about 8 percent of the domestic
long-distance market, is owned 80 percent by United
Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City. GTE Corp. of Stamford,
Conn., owns the remaining 20 percent.

<HEAD>Chrysler Adds Test-Drive Incentive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s newest wrinkle in the auto
industry's patchwork of incentives could cost the financially
strapped automaker millions of dollars.
   But Chrysler, which is offering $50 to anyone who test drives
its cars or trucks against any other, thinks the gamble is worth it.
   ``Nobody ever said promotion was cheap,'' Chrysler spokesman Tom
Houston said Monday. ``The name of the game is to get people in the
driver's seat.''
   Chrysler, amid a program to carve $1 billion in costs out of its
$26 billion annual budget by the end of the year, announced its
newest incentive program Sunday in commercials during the Super
Bowl football game.
   The new incentive offers $50 to anyone who test drives a
Chrysler product and any other comparable car or truck, and buys
either one. It doesn't matter which vehicle the consumer buys to
qualify for the $50.
   The company also said it was extending to the end of next month
some incentives announced Dec. 15 that originally were scheduled to
expire Wednesday.
   It's anyone's guess how many people will take Chrysler up on its
test drive, but if the company offered $50 only to the people who
bought one of the 64,000 cars Chrysler sold last month, it would
have handed out $3.2 million.
   Charles Brady, an automotive analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in
New York City, said he didn't think the cost of the test-drive
promotion would be unreasonable.
   ``I don't think many people will go through the hassle for
$50,'' Brady said. ``Probably half of them are going to end up
buying a Chrysler. When viewed in light of all the other
incentives, that's one-twentieth of a $1,000 rebate.''
   Incentives have been denting earnings for Chrysler, General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. for months. Each of the Big Three
report their fourth-quarter and year-end earnings for 1989 within
three weeks, and analysts are estimating they will be significantly
lower than in the previous year.
   Some speculate that Chrysler may not turn a profit in the fourth
quarter. If that happens, it would be the first quarter in which an
automaker has lost money since the fourth quarter of 1982, when
Chrysler lost $236 million and Ford lost $96.1 million.
   More than 90 percent of the cars and trucks Chrysler sells will
be covered in the extended incentive program, Houston said.
   Missing from the extended program are Chrysler's popular
minivans _ the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town
and Country.
   The incentive offers on those models, the first on minivans in
Chrysler history, will expire Wednesday, as originally planned. The
incentives had boosted sales strongly.

<HEAD>UAL Stock Hits 7-Month Low On Buyout Pessimism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor leaders at United Airlines say they'll make
a formal bid for parent UAL Corp. in due time, but that's not what
takeover speculators want to hear.
   UAL's stock plunged to a seven-month low Monday amid pessimism
about the prospects that United's employees will succeed in their
plan to buy 75 percent of the parent company.
   The airline's pilots, flight attendants and machinists are
negotiating with representatives of UAL's board to develop a formal
offer, a process that could take months.
   But time is not on the side of speculators who buy stock in
anticipation of a takeover, said analyst Robert Joedicke of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. .
   ``If you're an arbitrager, time is money,'' Joedicke said.
Speculators looking for a quick return will lose money ``if they're
going to have to sit around and wait while there's a soap opera
going on,'' he said.
   An arbitrage specialist at one large Wall Street brokerage said
his firm had sold all its UAL holdings.
   ``We're just taking it easy and we're going to wait and see if
the market corrects,'' said the arbitrager, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Union officials declined to comment Monday. But in phone-in
recorded messages to their members, they pleaded for patience while
buyout plans are negotiated.
   Other factors dampening investor enthusiasm for UAL are the
current disarray in the junk bond market, a major source of funds
for takeovers; a lack of details about the proposed UAL deal and a
history of discord between United's pilots and machinists; and
UAL's poor fourth-quarter results.
   ``The debt markets have turned so sour that investors may be
telling the unions that even if you are getting together, the debt
markets just aren't going to absorb any more debt from a new UAL,''
said Stephen Dexter, an analyst with Kemper Financial Services Inc.
in Chicago.
   UAL fell $13.50 in New York Stock Exchange trading Monday to
$136.50, its lowest price since late June.
   United's unionized pilots, machinists and flight attendants
proposed on Wednesday to buy a 75 percent stake in the
Chicago-based company, leaving the rest of the stock with the
public.
   On Thursday, UAL's board instructed its advisers to work with
the unions in developing a formal bid. The union proposal did not
mention the likely price of its offer, how it would finance the
deal or the future role of Chairman Stephen Wolf and other top
executives.
   Also on Thursday, UAL reported a 67 percent drop in its
fourth-quarter profit because of takeover-related costs, high fuel
expenses and an industry-wide decline in ridership.
   Analysts said economic uncertainty has created a poor
environment for any debt-financed takeover attempts, let alone a
bid for a company that has suffered one failed buyout already in
the past six months.

<HEAD>Boeing Reports Record Sales, Profits for 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. reported increased profits and
sales for 1989 despite a 48-day strike by Machinists and dismal
performance by defense segments.
   The aerospace and defense contractor also forecast Monday that
its 1990 sales would climb by 35 percent to about $27 billion.
   Boeing is reaping the rewards of five straight years of record
commercial jetliner orders, but said the strike by Machinists,
which ended Nov. 20, resulted in sales being off by about $2
billion for its fourth quarter.
   Boeing said earnings fell nearly 56 percent in the
fourth-quarter compared with the same 1988 period, while sales were
virtually the same as a year ago.
   ``It's certainly better than I thought, even with the strike,''
said George Podrasky Jr., an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago.
   Boeing had profits of $77 million, or 34 cents per share, on
sales of $4.85 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $174
million, or 76 cents per share, on sales of $4.88 billion in the
1988 quarter.
   For the year, Boeing reported profits of $973 million, or $4.23
a share, up 58 percent from $614 million, or $2.68 a share, in
1988. Sales were $20.3 billion, up nearly 20 percent from $17
billion a year earlier.
   In 1989, Boeing changed its method for computing income taxes,
which had the effect of increasing 1989 earnings by $298 million,
or $1.29 a share, the company said. Profits would have been up
about 10 percent for 1989 without that change.
   Excluding the effects of the accounting change, the higher
profits were due mostly to increased sales and lower research,
development and other business costs for commercial jets and
computing.
   But much of that was offset by the strike, large losses on some
government programs, higher federal taxes and higher research and
development costs on defense work, Boeing said.
   Boeing's defense and space businesses, which were consolidated
Jan. 1, had an operating loss of $474 million for 1989, compared
with operating profits of $29 million a year earlier. U.S.
government and foreign military sales totaled $5.9 billion in 1989,
up $371 million from 1988.
   A series of defense programs are behind schedule, including two
new Air Force One jets that are more than a year overdue; a project
to put new wings on Navy A-6 jets; the Peace Shield airborne
warning and control system for Saudi Arabia; and the Airborne
Optical Adjunct, a Star Wars project.
   While Boeing has been ``telegraphing they would lose money'' on
defense, ``I think the enormity of the defense and space loss was a
surprise,'' Podrasky said.
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York, said the poor results may be temporary.
   ``Undoubtedly this is something that can be rectified over
time,'' Nisbet said. He said most of Boeing's big money-losing
contracts either will be canceled or completed within a few years.
   Boeing set an industry record for commercial jet orders in 1989,
at 963 planes worth $47.5 billion. At year-end, the company had a
firm-order backlog worth $80.6 billion _ $74 billion of that for
commercial customers _ compared with $53.6 billion at the end of
1988.
   Since then, Boeing has picked up an order from Singapore
Airlines for 15 747-400s and options for another 15, worth a total
$5.5 billion, and America West on Monday ordered two 747-400s and
took options on two more in a deal worth $280 million.
International Lease Finance Corp. and Japan Air Systems also have
said they plan large purchases of Boeing aircraft.
   Despite the strike, Boeing delivered 342 planes last year, five
more than in 1988. For 1990, it plans to deliver 455 aircraft. The
figures include turboprop commuter planes from its Canadian
subsidiary, de Havilland.
   Boeing attributed its 1990 sales projection primarily to higher
commercial aircraft deliveries and from some major defense and
space programs, including the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control
System, CH-47 helicopter, Navy E-6 communications plane and A-6
re-wing, and the space station.

<HEAD>Bush Pushes Again for Capital Gains Tax Cut; Proposes Family
Saving Accounts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Democratic leaders of Congress balked at
cutting capital gains taxes last year, they pointed to Bush
administration estimates that a reduction would worsen the budget
deficit in three of the next 10 years.
   President Bush renewed the battle on Monday with a new set of
figures indicating a capital gains reduction would never reduce tax
collections.
   ``We see no negative effect in any year,'' a senior Treasury
Department official told reporters. The new estimates are based on
projections that a larger number of taxpayers would sell assets in
response to the lower tax rate, the official said.
   The administration predicted cutting taxes on capital gains _
profits from the sale of real estate, stock and other investments _
would actually increase tax collections in each of the next five
years by a total of $12.5 billion.
   Bush's somewhat different proposal last year would have raised
$16 billion by Treasury estimates over the first five years, lost
$20 billion over the next three and then begun producing revenue
again. Congressional analysts predicted small revenue increases in
the first two years followed by declines in each successive year.
   Bush says a capital gains reduction is needed to spur investment
in job creation and make the United States more competitive with
foreign countries. He also called for a new tax break to encourage
individual saving.
   Under those two major revenue proposals:
   _When fully effective in 1992, 30 percent of capital gains from
property owned three years or longer would be exempt from tax; 20
percent from assets owned two years, and 10 percent from property
owned at least one year. Most property, including real estate and
timber but not collectibles, would qualify.
   _Retroactive to Jan. 1, a couple whose income is $120,000 or
less could set aside up to $5,000 a year in a ``family savings
account'' and interest earned would be tax-exempt if the account is
held for at least seven years. Deposits of up to $2,500 a year
would be allowed single people with income under $60,000. The
deposits would not be tax deductible.
   Democratic leaders say a capital gains cut would begin undoing
the landmark 1986 tax overhaul, which taxed gains at the same rates
that apply to other income, and 80 percent of the benefits would go
to those with incomes of $100,000 a year.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., revived the
fairness argument Monday. ``At a time when President Bush wants to
cut the capital gains tax for the wealthy and maintain punishingly
high Social Security taxes on everyone else, I question whether his
priorities are right for the times,'' he said.
   The president took note of a well-publicized proposal by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., that would cut Social Security
taxes to stop the government from using surplus Social Security
revenues to pay for other programs. Bush declined to endorse such a
reduction; instead, he proposed that once the federal budget is
balanced, Social Security surpluses be used to retire government
debt.
   Bush's budget recommends $15.7 billion in tax increases, but no
general boost in income taxes, and a $5.6 billion increase in user
and service fees.
   The president proposed $1.8 billion in tax reductions in
addition to the capital gains cut, including a new credit of up to
$1,000 a year for each child under age 4 in low-income families.
   Among other revenue proposals, the budget would:
   _Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long distance
telephone service, which is due to expire Dec. 31.
   _Raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets to 10 percent.
   _More than triple the fee on waterway shippers, to 0.125 percent
of cargo value.
   _Require the 3.8 million state and local government workers who
are not covered by a retirement plan to pay Social Security taxes.
Also, state and local workers hired before April 1, 1986, would be
required to pay the 1.45 percent Medicare tax that most such
employees already pay.

<TEXT>
   Congressional approval of President Bush's new
budget would allow the Internal Revenue Service to increase the
number of tax returns it audits _ but not by much.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. told reporters the agency
anticipates auditing 102 returns per 10,000 that will be filed in
1990 and 103 per 10,000 next year. That compares with an all-time
low of 97 per 10,000 returns for the 1989 tax year.
   ``The fact remains that there has been a continuing decline in
audit coverage for a number of years, but now we are seeing a
reversal of the trend,'' Goldberg said after Bush's proposed budget
for the 1991 fiscal year was made public Monday.
   Although IRS officials agree that more returns should be
audited, they point to concerted efforts over the past few years to
target larger returns, those involving tax shelters and others
likely to yield more revenue.
   Even so, Goldberg said, the audit statistics do not tell the
whole story. He noted, for example, about 40 million couples and
individuals file returns that are based almost entirely on income
from wages, interest and dividends. IRS computers now automatically
check those returns against backup documents filed by employers,
banks and brokers to ensure that all income is reported.
   While those computer matches are not audits, Goldberg said, they
are thorough enough to make it difficult for taxpayers to
under-report such income.
   The agency's proposed budget for 1991 is $6.14 billion, up 11.6
percent from this year's $5.5 billion.
   A big part of that increase represents another installment on
the agency's plan to replace an outmoded computer system. Goldberg
said the new system will cost up to $6 billion over the next decade.
   One aim of the new system is to allow taxpayers to get answers
to questions about their tax accounts as easily as they get
information about a bill from a credit card company.
   The Bush administration estimates the IRS will collect an
additional $3 billion next year because of management initiatives
and the increase in the agency's own spending.
   Goldberg said the IRS will spend an additional $56 million and
assign about 1,000 new staff members to reducing accounts
receivable from a record level of nearly $60 billion. Those are
taxes that have been assessed but not paid.
   The agency expects to spend $330 million in the new year for
taxpayer service, which includes answering telephoned tax
questions. That figure is up from $317 million this year,
principally because last year IRS employees gave the wrong answer
to one of every three telephoned questions.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against other major
currencies in calm European trading today. Gold prices were
slightly lower in quiet European dealings.
   Despite some upward movement in the dollar, dealers said there
was pressure on the currency because of market perceptions of weak
economic growth in the United States.
   ``The dollar is going down,'' said a Milan trader. ``There's no
hope for it in the short-term.''
   Experts also were disappointed by the latest budget proposal by
the Bush administration, which they said did little to pare the
fiscal deficit.
   ``The market didn't react well to what Bush had to say,'' said a
Frankfurt trader.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.03 yen to a closing 143.25 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 143.87 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.6777 West German marks, down from 1.6795; 1.4880
Swiss francs, up from 1.4860; 5.6990 French francs, down from
5.7040; 1.8850 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8865; 1,248.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,249.75; and 1.1905 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1888.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6805 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6775 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $418.40 a troy ounce,
down from $418.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $417.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $417.75, down from $418.50 bid late
Monday.
   After a week-long break, gold in Hong Kong rose $9.04 to close
at a bid $416.35. The Hong Kong gold market last traded Jan. 24
before the Lunar New Year holiday.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.20 a troy ounce from
Monday's $5.22.

   The dollar ended its five-day slide against the
Japanese yen today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index
edged up.
   The dollar closed at 143.25 yen, up 0.03 yen from Monday's
143.22-yen close. It opened at 143.10 yen and ranged between 143.05
yen and 143.50 yen.
   The dollar fell a total of 3.20 yen over the previous five
trading days. Today, it gradually rose against the yen as market
players bought West German marks for both yen and dollars, said
Kenzo Shinomiya, a trader with Fuji Bank.
   ``Today's trading was dominated by dollar-mark and yen-mark
dealings, rather than dollar-yen dealings,'' he said.
   ``Considering the recent slowdown in the U.S. economy, the
market is expecting the dollar to be lower, though,'' he added.
   President Bush's fiscal 1991 budget, calling for a dramatic cut
in the nation's trade deficit, did not have much favorable
influence on the dollar here, Shinomiya said. Some $8.27 billion
changed hands in spot trading, up from $6.66 billion the previous
day.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
41.97 points, or 0.11 percent, closing at 37,215.67.
   Dealers attributed the gain mainly to stability in the Japanese
government bond and foreign exchange markets.
   ``Trading was very thin and directionless, and buying and
selling were mixed,'' said Satoru Nagayoshi, a dealer with New
Japan Securities Co. But index-linked buying by investment trusts
boosted the index, he said.
   An estimated 450 million shares changed hands on the first
section, up from Monday's 400 million.
   The Nikkei opened higher as market players were reassured by the
smaller-than-expected loss in the Dow Jones industrial average in
New York, which ended down 5.85 points after falling some 30 points
earlier in the day, Nagayoshi said.
   But then the Nikkei eased down following a temporary slump in
Japanese government bond prices, the yen's slight slip against the
dollar, and Sony's announcement that it would issue new bonds, said
Toshiaki Yui of Nomura Securities.
   Sony said it would issue 100 billion yen ($700 million) worth of
unsecured yen bonds with warrants and unsecured yen convertible
bonds in the Japanese stock market to refinance the acquisition of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment and the Guber-Peters Entertainment
Co. It set the offer for Feb. 7-9.
   Yui said Sony's announcement discouraged market players who
worried that an increase in the number of shares might push down
share prices.
   Among today's gainers were steel and shipbuilding issues.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses fell 3.6
percent to 5.88 million vehicles in 1989, the fourth consecutive
year of decline, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association
said Tuesday.
   The association said the main reason for the drop was a 9.9
percent decline in exports to the United States, where local
production of Japanese cars is expanding.
   It said six Japanese makers produced 1.25 million vehicles in
the United States in 1989, up 40.6 percent from 1988. Meanwhile,
exports to the United States from Japan fell to 2.43 million
vehicles.
   Globally, Japan exported 4.39 passengers cars in 1989, down 0.9
percent from 1988; 1.46 million trucks, down 10.4 percent, and
35,149 buses, down 23.1 percent, the association said.
   Japan produced a record 13.023 million motor vehicles in 1989,
up 2.6 percent from the previous year, and 7.26 million vehicles
were sold in Japan, up 8 percent.

   It won't be just pastel pink and baby blue

   The San Francisco-based retailer, which debuted its new line of
infant clothing and accessories at a local shopping center on
Monday, plans to open 35 more BabyGap sections across the country
within the next three months.
   The sections will offer a full line of clothing and accessories
for children up to 2 years old, including shirts, pants, jumpsuits,
caps, bibs, booties, blankets and diaper bags. The sections will
occupy about 12 percent of the floor space of the average GapKids
store, officials said.
   Colors will change every few months to reflect fashion trends.
Two of the current colors for the infant clothing line are banana
and peach.
   ``We've chosen a lot of colors that are not traditional baby
colors,'' said a spokesman.
   The expansion follows the introduction of GapKids, which has
been the company's fastest-growing division in percentage terms.
Analysts estimate that GapKids stores sales boomed from about $40
million last year to about $70 million in the fiscal year ending
this month.

<HEAD>Control Data Reports Worst Loss In 32-Year History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Control Data Corp. today reported losses of
$196 million for the fourth quarter and $680 million for last year,
the worst annual performance in the computer maker's 32-year
history.
   Lawrence Perlman, Control Data's president and chief executive
officer, has said 1989 marks the end of a six-year restructuring
that has included $1.4 billion in write-offs.
   For the October-December quarter, Control Data lost $4.63 a
share on revenue of $524 million. That compared with a net loss of
$12.8 million, or 31 cents a share, on $933 million in revenue in
the same 1988 period.
   The 1989 net loss of $16.11 a share on revenue of $2.9 billion
compares with a profit of $1.7 million, or 3 cents a share, on
revenue of $3.6 billion in 1988. The 1989 loss eclipsed losses of
$568 million in 1985 and $265 million in 1986.
   Aside from restructuring charges of $215 million in fourth
quarter and net charges for the year of $663 million, Control Data
was profitable in its last two quarters, Perlman said.
   ``The major restructuring actions Control Data carried out in
1989 have helped to focus the company and improve its opportunity
for success in 1990 and beyond,'' Perlman said.
   The fourth-quarter charge was linked largely to the previously
announced write-off for anticipated losses at chip-making
subsidiary VTC, which the company will sell in 1990, Perlman said.
VTC never made money in its five-year history.
   Other large write-offs for the year stemmed from the shutdown of
ETA Systems, a money-losing supercomputer subsidiary, and a
streamlining of the company's mainframe business.
   Another important move during the year was the sale for $470
million of Control Data's profitable disc drive subsidiary to
Seagate Technology. It was completed in September and did not
contribute to fourth-quarter results.
   Perlman has said the restructuring leaves the company poised to
make between $50 million and $60 million in 1990 on sales of about
$2 billion. Six years ago, sales at the company were about $5
billion.
   Gary Smaby, a Minneapolis computer industry analyst, said
Perlman will have to make good on his projection for Control Data
to be considered a legitmate turn-around stock.
   ``Perlman appears to be the right man,'' Smaby said. ``But just
because they have gone through this gut-wrenching subtraction, it's
not a slam dunk that they will be a success.''

<TEXT>
   A Utah businessman has offered to raise his
bid for Aristech Chemical Corp. to at least $934.2 million if the
company gives him more time to review its financial records.
   In a letter sent to Aristech's board Monday, Salt Lake City
chemicals magnate Jon Huntsman asked the company to extend its
deadline for bids until Feb. 14. Huntsman is trying to form a joint
venture with General Electric Co. to acquire Aristech for at least
$27 a share.
   A deadline set by a special Aristech board committee expired at
5 p.m. Monday. A special committee of the company's board set the
deadline after the company's managers and Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan
said their competing $26-a-share offer, worth $899.6 million, would
expire at the end of business today.
   Aristech spokesman David Higie declined comment today.
   ``I want to emphasize to the special committee and the entire
board that we genuinely want to acquire Aristech,'' Huntsman's
letter said. ``The fact is, however, that is is not reasonable for
you to expect us to make our formal proposal until we have had a
reasonable period of time to complete a reasonable due diligence
review of your company.''
   Huntsman's earlier bid of $25 a share was rejected in November
as inadequate.
   Pittsburgh-based Aristech has reserved the option of rejecting
any of the first-round offers and suggested that if none is high
enough it will reopen bidding.
   The company employs about 1,800 people in eight states.

<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. on Tuesday reported a
12 percent drop in earnings for the 1989 fourth-quarter, blaming
charges for engineering consolidation expenses and early debt
retirement.
   For the period ending Dec. 31, MCI reported profits of $101
million, or 39 cents per share, compared with $115 million, or 46
cents per share, for the same 1988 period.
   Quarterly revenue increased 20 percent to $1.71 billion from
$1.43 billion a year earlier.
   For the full year, the telephone giant said profits surged 58
percent to $529 million, or $2.09 a share, from $334 million, or
$1.23 a share, in 1988. Annual revenue increased 26 percent to
$6.47 million from $5.14 million.
   MCI said fourth-quarter traffic volume increased but the company
had to take a $35 million pre-tax charge to consolidate some
engineering operations in Texas and a $35 million after-tax charge
for early retirement of $500 million in remaining principal on its
original $1 billion debt issue.
   ``In a marketplace that has seen increasing competition and some
downward pricing pressure, MCI's overall market penetration has
grown by approximately 2 percentage points,'' Bert C. Roberts Jr.,

<HEAD>Crop Futures Narrowly Mixed After Higher Opening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices turned narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after
opening higher on bullish technical signals.
   On Monday, soybean futures rose sharply in what technical
analysts called a ``key reversal,'' an indication that the market's
six-week downward trend might have ended.
   The resulting across-the-board rally continued into today's
opening, then stalled amid uncertainty about the strength of the
turnaround.
   ``The market needs to go back down and retest support to give
traders confidence that the key reversal is intact,'' said William
Biedermann, director of research for the futures brokerage
Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   A drop to Monday's lows followed by a higher close would confirm
the reversal, he said.
   Supply-and-demand factors were mixed. A weekly Agriculture
Department report showing greater-than-expected amounts of corn and
soybeans inspected for export last week was offset by concerns
about the potential for a record large South American soybean crop.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.79\ a bushel;
corn was { cent lower to { cent higher with March at $2.39{ a
bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at
$1.38{ a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to { cent higher with
March at $5.63\ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed while pork bellies were lower in
early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were unchanged to .15 cent higher with
February at 79.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with March at 83.30 cents a pound; live hogs
were .05 cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at 49.55 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .22 cent to 1.10 cents lower with
February at 51 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mixed on Monday. Pork bellies fell the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound amid a bevy of bearish
technical and fundamental factors.

   International bankers were told _ but didn't
care _ that suitcases of cash deposited in their vaults came from
Colombian cocaine dealers, prosecutors said today as a $32 million
money-laundering trial opened.
   The six defendants include Amjad Awan, an international banker
who once claimed to handle Manuel Noriega's secret accounts.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Rubenstein described how
proceeds fom cocaine sales were turned into cash and filtered
through the defendants' institution, the Luxembourg-based Bank of
Credit and Commerce International.
   An undercover Customs agent in Detroit would pick up suitcases
of cash from strangers, then call a contact in Medellin, Colombia,
to advise him, he said. The money was converted into certificates
of deposit, which were used first as collateral for loans, then to
pay them off as they matured.
   The undercover agent told Awan where the money came from,
Rubenstein said.
   ``And Awan responded, `It's not any business of mine who the
customers are,''' the prosecutor quoted the agent as saying.
   The defense was expected to begin its opening arguments later in
the day.
   U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges on Jan. 17 denied a
defense motion to block any mention of Noriega during the trial.
   Awan, a former Latin American assistant division director for
the Bank of Credit and Commerce, told a Senate panel in 1988 he
managed secret accounts for Noriega that held up to $23 million.
   On trial with Awan are Rudolph Armbrect of Medellin, Colombia,
and four former employees of the bank.
   Just before the start of jury selection two weeks ago, guilty
pleas were entered by the Luxembourg bank and a Colombian who
prosecutors said ran a network to help traffickers hide the source
of their drug money.
   As part of a plea bargain, the bank, one of the world's largest
private financial institutions, agreed to forfeit a record $14
million in assets frozen by the government and to cooperate against
other defendants.
   Gonzalo Mora Jr. pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, conspiracy
and money laundering.
   The indictment resulted from a two-year sting in which an
undercover agent conned his way into an international money
laundering network.
   After that, agents helped direct profits from cocaine sales in
American cities to Colombia through Panama, eventually building a
global laundering operation worth an estimated $32 million,
investigators said.
   Customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for
Colombian drug traffickers, including the Medellin cartel.
   Awan was arrested while attending a phony stag party for a groom
who was an undercover Customs agent.
   Noriega is being held in Miami on charges he accepted millions
of dollars in bribes for allowing the cartel to launder money and
process and ship drugs through Panama to the United States.

dragged down by weakness in UAL stock.
   ``A pall exists over the market because of the pressure on deal
stocks,'' said Emmanuel Geronimous, senior vice president at
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Analysts said the market also interpreted as negative remarks by
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today before the Joint
Economic Committee in Washington D.C.
   Greenspan said the probability of a recession is less than 50
percent, lower than previously anticipated, and that the current
4.5 percent inflation rate is ``unacceptable.''
   ``Greenspan seemed to be signaling there would be no
accommodation by the Fed on interest rates,'' said Larry Wachtel,

<TEXT>
   The Limited Inc. will move offices of its
720-store Lane Bryant division from New York into a $110 million
complex being built in a Columbus suburb, Gov. Richard Celeste and
company officials said Tuesday.
   Lane Bryant, a women's special size apparel retailer, is
expected to move into its new headquarters in May or June of 1991.
   Kenneth B. Gilman, Limited's executive vice president and chief
financial officer, said a significant, but undetermined, number of
the 240 employees at Lane Bryant's Manhattan headquarters were
expected to move to Ohio.
   Three other New York-based divisions _ Henri Bendel, Brylane,
and Lerner _ that together employ 800 to 1,000 people, will remain
in New York.
   Gilman said at a news conference that the Lane Bryant division
is expanding.
   ``Our plans for Lane Bryant include building that business to
achieve sales in excess of $2 billion. It's somewhat less than $1
billion at this point,'' he said.
   The home office work force will be significantly higher than 240
people once the sales goal is achieved, he said.
   The Lane Bryant offices and distribution center will be housed
in one of two buildings at a site in Reynoldsburg, about 10 miles
east of Columbus. In addition to the 950,000 square feet Lane
Bryant building, a 910,000-square-foot structure will house
Victoria's Secret stores and catalogue offices and distribution
centers.
   The Limited, a leading specialty apparel retailer based in
Columbus, already employs 4,000 people in central Ohio. It operates
3,176 stores around the country under the names Limited, Express,
Victoria's Secret, Henri Bendel, Lerner, Lane Bryant and
Abercrombie &amp; Fitch.
   Celeste viewed the switch as an affirmation that a national
business can thrive from a base in central Ohio.
   ``What to me is more important than the size of the site is what
it means to bring the Lane Bryant headquarters here to join with
the already very enormous commitment that The Limited has to
Columbus and central Ohio,'' Celeste said.
   The state has committed $2 million to widen a highway leading to
the project site.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Borden Inc. on Tuesday reported a 6.5 percent
fourth-quarter earnings gain despite a 1.5 percent sales drop due
largely to a decline in the dairy business.
   A previously announced $570.7 million pretax charge resulted in
a $60.6 million loss for all of last year.
   Borden earned $99.91 million, or 67 cents a share, in the three
months ended Dec. 31, up from $93.85 million, or 63 cents a share,
in the corresponding 1988 quarter. Sales fell to $1.95 billion from
$1.98 billion.
   R.J. Ventres, chairman and chief executive officer, said
Borden's grocery and specialty products divisions improved
substantially during the quarter, led by the pasta business. But
the growth was partly offset by ``the severe squeeze on profit
margins in our dairy division.''
   The reserve, which came to $404.4 million after taxes, or $2.73
a share, was established to cover the costs of a corporatewide
reconfiguration and various restructuring programs.
   A major portion of the plans announced Sept. 28 involved
restructuring Borden's dairy operation and getting out of
overcrowded markets.
   The sum set aside led to the 1989 loss, which amounted to 41
cents a share, and compared with a profit of $311.88 million, or
$2.11 a share, in 1988. Last year's sales rose 4.8 percent to $7.59
billion from 1988's $7.24 billion.
   Excluding the one-time charge, Borden said its 1989 earnings
increased $31.9 million, or 10.2 percent.

   Mellon Bank Corp. said Tuesday it is seeking a
buyer for Mellon Financial Services, its Illinois-based consumer
finance company.
   If the sale goes through, Mellon said it won't issue common
stock in connection with its plan to purchase 54 PSFS branches from
Meritor Savings Bank in Philadelphia.
   Mellon previously said it had expected to finance the
acquisition by issuing common stock, preferred stock and debt.
   ``Mellon Financial Services is a profitable, well-run consumer
finance business, but it is not essential to the achievement of our
retail banking strategy,'' said Mellon Bank Chairman Frank V.
Cahouet.
   Mellon Financial Services, based in Oak Brook, Ill., employs
about 375 people at 97 offices in 17 states, mostly in the Midwest
and West. It specializes in consumer lending, dealer sales finance
plans and resort time-sharing loans.
   As of Dec. 31, Mellon Financial Services had assets of about
$550 million, liabilities of about $495 million and equity of about
$55 million, Mellon said.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. has been retained by the corporation to
assist in identifying potential buyers and evaluating their bids,
Mellon said.

   A woman with a passion for clipping coupons and
proof-of-purchase seals was convicted today of swapping and
redeeming counterfeit coupons in an alleged $2 million scam.
   A federal jury deliberated five days before reaching its verdict
against Connie Arvidson, 34, of Boca Raton, Fla.
   The woman dubbed ``Coupon Connie'' was convicted of conspiracy
and mail fraud and could receive up to 15 years in prison and
$750,000 in fines at sentencing March 23.
   David Rees of Center Point was found guilty of conspiracy, said
Maureen Ruprecht, court coordinator for U.S. District Judge Sidney
Fitzwater. A third defendant, James Floyd Richards of San Antonio,
was cleared of all charges.
   Prosecutors had charged that the three defendants counterfeited
and redeemed or swapped more than 600,000 copies of coupons issued
by 47 companies, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Nabisco Brands Inc.
and Campbell Soup Co.
   Participants in the scheme used the coupons to purchase the
products and then sold the items at flea markets, authorities said.
   Proceeds were used by Mrs. Arvidson to purchase a fashionable
Florida home and two expensive cars, U.S. Attorney Steve Sucsy said.
   The judge set bond for Mrs. Arvidson at $10,000. Rees was freed
on his own recognizance.
   Mrs. Arvidson, who became known as the ``Dumpster Lady'' for
rummaging through the trash for coupons and proof-of-purchase
seals, turned a passion into a profitable business. She estimated
she took in $200 a week at her peak.
   She and nine others were indicted in June.
   Prosecutors said she knowingly took part in a scheme to swap and
redeem bogus coupons. Mrs. Arvidson maintained didn't know the
coupons she bought through an advertisement in a coupon magazine
were counterfeit.

   A report that Mikhail Gorbachev may resign as
Soviet communist party chief jolted the stock market, sending it
into wild gyrations and some traders to the sidelines.
   Prices were so volatile shortly after 2 p.m. EST that traders at
one investment brokerage stopped trading temporarily while the
market calmed down.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell immediately
after the Gorbachev report, rebounded and then slipped again, was
down 16.89 points to 2,536.49 at 3 p.m. EST. An hour earlier, the
blue-chip indicator was 19.82 points lower.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 4 to 1 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,204 issues down, 330 up and 408

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 157.10 million
shares.
   ``Confusion is reigning supreme. Most professional traders are
on the sidelines,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst
for MKI Securities Corp. in New York.
   Jensen said that from one minute to the next prices soared and
dropped.
   ``We haven't seen a market of this kind for sometime. It's
pulsating, vibrating without any sense of direction,'' Jensen said.
   Analysts said the news alternately hit the financial markets,
currency markets and commodities and metals markets.
   The report on Cable News Network that Gorbachev may resign as
the head of the communist party fueled the stock futures market,
which in turn drove the cash market.
   Analysts said after the initial reaction, traders were
attempting to get clarification on the impact of a possible
resignation.
   Before the report, interest rates and concern about financing
for takeovers were the market's chief worries.
   Analysts said the market also interpreted as negative this

   The Coca-Cola Co. said its fourth-quarter
earnings more than tripled from a year ago, reflecting a huge
one-time gain from the sale of its stake in Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc.
   The soft drink giant's net income for the fourth quarter was
$757.2 million, or $2.22 a share, up from $235.5 million, or 65
cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 11 percent to $2.25 billion from
$2.03 billion a year earlier.
   The quarterly earnings included a gain of $509.4 million from
the sale of Coca-Cola's 49 percent stake in Columbia Pictures in
November, the company said. Without the gain, the quarterly
earnings per share would have been 72 cents, Coca-Cola said.
   For the full year, net income was $1.72 billion, or $4.92 a
share, up 65 percent from $1.04 billion, or $2.85 a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 7.5 percent to $8.97 billion from
$8.34 billion a year earlier.
   After excluding the gain of $1.47 per common share from the sale
of Columbia Pictures Entertainment and a 10-cent gain on the sale
of Belmont Water Springs Co. in August, yearly net income per
common share was $3.35, the company said.
   ``Our global soft drink business experienced another year of
record achievements in 1989,'' Coca-Cola Chairman Roberto C.
Goizueta said in a statement.
   He said the company's share of the global soft drink business
increased to more than 45 percent in 1989 from 38 percent,
including a rise to more than 40 percent of the U.S. market from 36
percent.
   Goizueta said the company is ``extremely well positioned to
continue to achieve strong profitable growth in 1990 and for the
remainder of the decade.''

   USX Corp. said Tuesday its earnings increased
54 percent in the final three months of 1989, reflecting strong
gains in the company's steel and energy businesses.
   Fourth-quarter earnings totaled $244 million or 91 cents a share
on revenues of $4.9 billion. That compared with $158 million or 55
cents a share on revenues of $4.4 billion in the same 1988 period.
   Earnings for all of 1989 increased nearly 28 percent to $965
million or $3.53 a share on revenues of $18.7 billion. That
compared with $756 million or $2.62 a share on revenues of $16.9
billion in 1988.
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry said the company's operating
income increased to a record $1.6 billion in 1989 from $1.4 billion
in 1988.
   Operating income in the energy segment more than doubled to $987
million in 1989 compared with $475 million in 1988. Fourth-quarter
operating income was $166 million in 1989, compared with $116
million in 1988.
   The steel division's operating income totaled $430 million in
1989, compared with $501 million in 1988. The reduced income was
due partly to the sale of the Lorain, Ohio, steel works to a 50
percent-owned joint venture in the second quarter of 1989.
   The steel division's fourth-quarter operating income was $75
million, compared with $16 million in 1988. The fourth quarter of
1988 included a $46 million loss in connection with 1986 steel
plant shutdowns.
   Marathon Oil Co. reported operating income of $166 million on
sales of $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter. That compared with
$123 million on sales of $2.4 billion in the same period of 1988.
   ``Our energy segment is well-positioned to benefit from an
improving energy market,'' Corry said. ``In the steel segment our
efforts through the 1980s to cut costs and improve efficiency and
product quality will enable us to continue competing profitably in
the worldwide steel marketplace.
   ``There are signs of recovery in the oil country tubular goods
market where we hold a preeminent position.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Lower On Gorbachev Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed
moderately lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade following an
unconfirmed report that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev might
resign as Communist Party chairman.
   The midafternoon report on the Cable News Network stirred fears
of a change in the Soviet Union toward more isolationist policies
and less foreign trade, including fewer purchases of foreign grain.
   The CNN report, attributed to an unidentified source, said
Gorbachev would remain president of the Soviet Union. A White House
spokesman said the Bush administration had no information on the
report.
   The report overshadowed bullish sentiments linked to Monday's
strong rebound in the soybean market, which some analysts had said
could mark a turnaround in the market's six-week decline.
   But crop futures were trading lower even before the CNN report
surfaced.
   ``There was no follow-through from yesterday,'' said analyst
Joel Karlin of Research Department Inc., a brokers' advisory
service.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2} cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.76 a bushel; corn futures
were \ cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $2.38\ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to } cent lower with March at $1.37{ a bushel; soybeans

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once self-proclaimed the most
innovative company in the world, Control Data Corp. has entered the
1990s as a much smaller business scarred by $1.4 billion in losses
in the past five years.
   The loss of $680.4 million for 1989, reported Tuesday, was the
worst performance in the computer company's 32-year history. It
eclipsed the 1985 loss of $567.5 million, the previous worst batch
of red ink.
   In fact, in the 1980s, Control Data lost twice as much money as
it earned: $1.43 billion vs. $664.1 million.
   To fix things, management has lopped off huge subsidiaries and
parted ways with founder William C. Norris. The moves will reduce
sales to an estimated $2 billion in 1990 compared with $5 billion
in 1984.
   ``They've cut off the patient's legs, arms and nose,'' said
Peter Zidek, a supercomputer consultant who once worked for Control
Data. ``There's not much left to operate on.''
   Launched as a maker of mainframe scientific computers, Control
Data diversified quickly into financial services by leasing
industrial equipment and selling insurance. In 1977 for example,
Control Data made about $10.6 million on insurance sales, six times
what the entire company earned in 1988.
   The company's far-flung enterprises also came to include
windmill farms, factories built in ghettos, incubation centers for
small businesses and a training program that encouraged city
dwellers to take up farming.
   ``We were in too many businesses,'' said Control Data spokesman
Frank Ryan. ``Management's focus can only go so far.''
   The remedy, carried out mostly by Norris' successor, Robert
Price, has been to sell more than 20 businesses or product lines
since 1984.
   The selloffs in 1989 included a disk drive subsidiary that
accounted for a third of Control Data's $3.62 billion revenues in
1988, and the shutdown of supercomputer subsidiary ETA Systems. The
latter lost more than $230 million in its six-year life and cost
$335 million to close.
   Another major down-sizing occurred in 1986 and 1987, when
Control Data cut all ties to Commercial Credit, the financial
services subsidiary that throughout much of the 1970s generated
more profit than the company's computer business.
   The changes have coincided with a 72 percent reduction in
employment at Control Data _ from a high of 60,600 in 1981 to about
17,000 at the end of 1989.
   Later this year, 400 more jobs will be cut from Control Data
when the company sells it VTC chip-making subsidiary. Mostly to
cover anticipated losses at VTC, the company wrote off about $214.7
million in the fourth quarter, resulting in a net loss of $196.4
million, or $4.63 a share.
   Newly appointed President Lawrence Perlman has said VTC should
be the last write-off in Control Data's six-year effort to
transform itself into a computer-based services company. He is
projecting a profit of up to $63 million this year.
   Gary Smaby, a computer industry analyst in Minneapolis, said
Perlman must meet that projection if Control Data is to be
considered a legitimate turnaround stock. In 1983, the stock traded
as high as $63.25 a share. On Monday it closed at $16.25 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   A darling of securities analysts, Perlman made his mark at
Control Data by transforming the money-losing disk drive subsidiary
into a major profit center before it was sold.
   ``But just because they have gone through this gut-wrenching
subtraction, it's not a slam dunk that they will be a success,''
Smaby said.
   What's left of Control Data includes an installed computer base
of 1,500 mainframes and 1,500 workstations. Maintaining the base is
a huge business, but the company isn't likely to add greatly to its
own hardware, Smaby said.
   Instead, Control Data will be devising new applications with
hardware made by others.
   ``You don't have to be designing the computer anymore. You can't
sell enough of them to underwrite the costs,'' said Lloyd
Thorndyke, a co-founder of ETA Systems. ``Control Data is down to
services _ using computers to manipulate data the way customers
like it.''
   Control Data divides its businesses into two categories: data
services and data systems. Services includes the Arbitron TV
ratings unit, payroll processing and Ticketron. Data systems is the
computer core.
   Zidek said much of the malaise at Control Data stemmed from the
overall softness in the computer industry. But the company was hurt
more than others because its direction under Norris was diluted by
social endeavors, he said. In addition, Zidek said, the
engineer-laden leadership didn't pay enough attention to marketing.
   In Control Data's 1979 annual report, Norris wrote, ``Simply
stated, there is no more innovative company in the world.''

<HEAD>Marriott Selling Roy Rogers To Hardee's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marriott Corp. took the first step in
retreating from the fast food business Tuesday by announcing the
sale of its Roy Rogers restaurant chain to rival Hardee's for $365
million in cash.
   The deal represents the third major acquisition for Hardee's
Food Systems Inc., and puts the Rocky Mount, N.C., company firmly
in third place ahead of Wendy's in terms of the number of
restaurants nationally, analysts said.
   McDonald's and Burger King are first and second.
   ``Hardee's has found a way to expand its presence without
diluting its penetration,'' said Daniel R. Lee, an analyst with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York, who called the deal a
brilliant move.
   ``And Marriott gets out of the (fast food) business where they
couldn't grow and compete effectively.''
   Marriott said last month it would sell the Roy Rogers fast food
chain consisting of over 600 restaurants located primarily in the
Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York areas as part of a
restructuring.
   J.W. Marriott Jr., chairman and president of the hotel and
lodging company which bears his family's name, said the sale of the
Roy Rogers restaurants, which the company formed in 1968, ``will
help us to concentrate our focus on our lodging and contract
service operations in the 1990s.''
   Marriott is also selling most of its other family and fast-food
restaurant holdings, including 235 Bob's Big Boys and an assortment
of moderately priced restaurants it runs under the Howard
Johnson's, Wag's, Bickford's and Allie's names. It said it hopes to
raise at least $500 million from the sales.
   William E. Prather, Jr., Hardee's president and chief executive,
said the acquisition would improve his company's presence in the
Northeast.
   ``It's a sound strategic fit for us,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``We look forward to a successful blending of the
chains.''
   Prather said the company-owned restaurants will be converted to
Hardee's on a market-by-market basis. Existing Roy Rogers franchise
agreements will be honored.
   ``We have an obligation to run the Roy Rogers chain forever, if
necessary,'' he said.
   Tuesday's deal is the third major acquisition by Hardee's. The
200-unit Sandy's system was purchased in 1982, and the 650-unit
Burger Chef chain was bought in 1982.
   Hardee's annual sales through 3,300 restaurants in 40 states and
nine foreign countries amount to about $3.5 billion.
   Marriott has 1990 projected sales of $7.5 billion.

<TEXT>
   Warner-Lambert Co. reported Tuesday
that its fourth quarter profit rose 19 percent over a year ago,
capping a year of higher earnings.
   The health and consumer products giant netted $92.30 million, or
$1.37 a share, compared with earnings of $77.54 million, or $1.14 a
share, in 1988.
   Sales rose to $1.04 billion from $997.88 million in the year-ago
period.
   For the year, Warner-Lambert earned $412.66 million, or $6.10 a
share, on sales of $4.19 billion. That was up 21 percent from net
income of $340.30 million, or $5 a share, and $3.90 billion in
sales.
   Chairman Joseph D. Williams called 1989 the company's best year,
and predicted strong results in the near-term, too.
   Williams told securities analysts last week that he expected
1990 per-share earnings to increase by about 15 percent based on
sales gains of 8 percent.
   During 1989, worldwide sales of Warner-Lambert's prescription
products rose more than 9 percent to $1.3 billion, and its
non-prescription health products grew 6 percent to $1.4 billion.
   Sales of its cholesterol regulator, Lopid, rose by around 50
percent to $285 million last year. The anti-convulsant Dilantin and
cardiovascular drug Dilzem also performed well, the company said.
   Warner-Lambert noted gains in non-prescription products
including Halls cough tablets, Listerine mouthwash, Rolaids antacid
and its gum and mint division.

<HEAD>Outside Directors Gain Control of American Brands Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shakeup on the board of directors of
American Brands Inc. Tuesday gave outside directors control of the
diversified company, which sells everything from cigarettes to life
insurance to Jim Beam bourbon.
   The changes quickly incited speculation that American Brands
might become a takeover target. The company's stock closed up $1.25
to 66 on the New York Stock Exchange in heavy trading.
   In a brief statement, William J. Alley, American Brands chairman
and chief executive officer, announced that five management
directors have resigned from the company's 17-member board of
directors.
   Alley also announced that Gordon R. Lohman, president of
Chicago-based AMSTED Industries Inc., had been elected to the board.
   Lohman's election gave outside directors seven of the 13 spots
on the board of directors.
   One analyst said the move could foreshadow a buyout attempt by
the board, but others saw the shakeup simply as part of a trend
toward outside control of large companies.
   ``The trend is in that direction, toward more outside
directors.'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for PaineWebber. ``I
wouldn't venture to say that anybody's out to take anybody over at
this point.''
   Said Eugene R. Anderson, a New York lawyer and one of the seven
outside directors, ``This is kind of a non-event in the history of
American Brands.''
   The company's stock closed at 66 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, up from 64{ when the market opened Tuesday.
   One analyst, Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch, noted that several
of American Brands' divisions would be attractive as individual
properties. He said the changes on the board of directors could
foreshadow a buyout offer by the directors.
   ``I don't know of any other reason why they would do that,'' he
said.
   The company has four core divisions: tobacco, distilled spirits,
life insurance and office products. Its brands include Carlton,
Lucky Strike, Tareyton and Pall Mall cigarettes, Gilbey's gin and
vodka, Jim Beam bourbon and Titleist golf products.
   The company reported earnings of $631 million or $6.51 per share
on sales of $11.92 billion in 1989, and earnings of $580 million or
$5.44 per share in 1988, said spokesman Roger Baker.

<TEXT>
   Contracts for new construction nationwide grew 1
percent in December, halting a steep slide in contracting during
the previous two months, the F.W. Dodge division of McGraw-Hill
Inc. reported Tuesday.
   However, a generally weak fourth quarter left 1989's total of
newly started construction barely even with 1988 at $261.2 billion,
the company said.
   The Dodge Index, which uses 1982 as its 100 base, averaged 166
throughout 1989, the same as in 1988. In 1987, the index stood at
165, extablishing a three-year plateau of uncommon stability for
the usually volatile construction industry, the company said.
   In December, contracts for non-residential buildings grew 4
percent to an annualized $88.3 billion, while the value of
residential work increased by 1 percent to an annualized $116.4
billion.
   Non-building construction contracts, such as for public works
and utility projects, declined by 5 percent in December to an
annualized $46.2 billion, due mainly to a cutback in highway and
bridge contracts, the company said.

   America West Airlines reported Tuesday that
its fourth quarter profit tumbled over a year ago but earnings for
all of 1989 nearly doubled.
   In the final three months of last year, the company netted $1.13
million, or 4 cents a share, compared with earnings of $19.06
million, or $1.18 a share, in 1988. Revenue rose to $278.25 million
from $211.83 million a year ago.
   For the year, America West's net income totaled $20.18 million,
or $1 a share, on revenue of $993.4 million. That compared with
1988 earnings of $9.36 million, or 51 cents a share, and $775.67
million in revenue.
   A.E. Frei, America West's chief financial officer, attributed
the weaker quarterly results partly to higher fuel prices.
   ``Fuel prices continued to to climb in January 1990 and will
certainly affect early 1990 earnings,'' Frei said.
   The airline provides service to around 60 cities in the United
States and western Canada.

<HEAD>Order $3 Billion in Boeing, Douglas, Airbus Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Lease Finance Corp.
said Tuesday it had ordered nearly $3 billion worth of Boeing,
McDonnell Douglas and Airbus Industrie jetliners, with options to
buy another $3.3 billion worth of planes.
   The big winner in the deals was Seattle-based Boeing Co.
International Lease Finance exercised options for $1.055 billion in
Boeing planes, made firm orders for $795 million more, and acquired
new options worth $2.535 billion in Boeing 737s, 747s, 757s and
767s.
   In all, International Lease Finance, which leases planes to
airlines, ordered 66 planes and acquired options for 67 more. It
was the biggest order for International Lease Finance since it
ordered $6.6 billion in jets from Boeing and Airbus in May 1988.
   St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., snubbed in that last
big order, got a piece of the action Tuesday. International Lease
Finance ordered 15 of the company's new MD-90 twin-engine jets for
$562.5 million and took options on another 15 at the same price.
   The MD-90, an embellished version of the MD-80, is produced at
McDonnell Douglas' transport aircraft division in Long Beach,
Calif. Delivery of the first plane is scheduled for early 1995.
   International Lease Finance placed new orders with Seattle-based
Boeing for 15 planes: one 747-400, three 757-200s, three
767-300ERs, and eight 737s of various designs, with the first to be
delivered in January 1995.
   In addition to that $795 million order, the company exercised
options acquired in May 1988 for 24 Boeing jetliners valued at
$1.055 billion.
   International Lease Finance acquired options for 48 additional
jetliners _ $2.535 billion in all.
   The leasing company also said it had placed firm orders for 12
A321-100s from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, with
first delivery scheduled for 1995. The order is worth $510 million.
International Lease Finance also placed options for four more of
the A321s, worth another $170 million.

   Energy futures finished lower Tuesday after
crude oil prices temporarily spiked higher on an unconfirmed report
that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may resign as Communist party
chief.
   Market analysts said petroleum trading was generally uneventful
otherwise and volume was average.
   The contract for March delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 34 cents to $22.46 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, more than
wiping out Monday's gain of 24 cents. Later delivery contracts also
declined.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
No. 2 heating oil for February delivery dropped 0.60 cent to 60.51
cents a gallon, erasing a substantial portion of Monday's 1.51-cent
increase.
   It was the last trading day for the February heating oil
contract. The March contract, which becomes the near-month contract
starting with Wednesday's session, tumbled 1.04 cents to 58.18
cents a gallon. The April and May contracts ended with more
moderate declines.
   The expiring February contract for unleaded regular gasoline
shed 0.9 cent to 62.73 cents a gallon following Monday's rise of
0.7 cent. The March gas contract fell 0.35 cent to 62.69 cents a
gallon. The April and May contracts also finished lower.
   Futures trading frequently is more volatile near the expiration
date of contracts. There was little news to account for the
weakness in the refined products and said trading seemed to be
steadying as the nearby contracts expired, said Greg Dreis, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   A CNN report that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was
considering resigning as Communist party chief injected uncertainty
into many financial markets and spurred buying in the crude oil
pits. But the impact of the report from Moscow was short lived.

   The stock market closed broadly lower Tuesday
after being jolted by a news report that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev might resign as Soviet communist party chief.
   ``The report produced a technical bounce in the market. It was
jerking all over the lot,'' said Michael Metz, technical analyst
for Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the session
10.14 points lower at 2,543.24 after flip-flopping throughout the
day.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by nearly 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,156 issues down, 399 up and 431 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 186.03 million
shares, up from 150.77 million in the previous session.
   Analysts said the report about Gorbachev's possible resignation
on Cable News Network caused reactions throughout the financial
markets. Stock prices became so volatile shortly after the 2 p.m.
EST report that traders at one investment brokerage stopped trading
temporarily until the market calmed down.
   The Dow, which was heading lower during the afternoon,
intensified its slide after the news report. Off more than 27
points at 2:30 p.m., the average jumped back into the plus column
briefly before finishing lower at the close.
   ``We haven't seen a market of this kind for some time. It's
pulsating, vibrating without any sense of direction,'' said Charles
Jensen, chief technical analyst for MKI Securities Corp. in New
York.
   Aside from the Gorbachev report, interest rates and concern
about financing for takeovers remained the market's chief worries.
   Analysts said the market also interpreted remarks by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the Joint Economic Committee
in Washington D.C. as a sign that the central bank would not reduce
interest rates anytime soon.
   Greenspan said the probability of a recession is less than 50
percent, lower than previously anticipated, and that the current
rate of inflation is ``unacceptable.''
   ``Greenspan says he's not going to tolerate 4.5 percent
inflation, which makes me think interest rates aren't going
lower,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A.G. Edwards &amp;
Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Traders said computerized program strategies, which have become
an increasingly bigger part of trading volume after declining late
last year, contributed to the market's volatility.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 215.39 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market declined $27.18 billion, or 0.87
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.30 to 178.43.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, AT&amp;T fell 1} to 37},
New Germany lost { to 24&lsqb;, Federal National Mortgage declined 1&rsqb; to

lower, tumbled 15{ to 121.
   Among gainers, IBM was unchanged at 97\, Bank of New England

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index closed down 2.39 at 371.92,
and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 2.22 to 322.98.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell

   The dollar jumped in panicky trading Tuesday on
an unconfirmed news report that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
would resign as Communist Party chairman.
   Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, a troy
ounce of gold fell $1 to close at $418.10. Republic National Bank
later quoted a bid of $418.30 a troy ounce, up 10 cents from Monday.
   The report by Cable News Network about 2 p.m. EST said Gorbachev
may step down as party leader but retain his post as president. CNN
quoted sources as saying the move would alllow Gorbachev to
distance himself from the party amid internal turmoil in the Soviet
Union.
   In New York, the dollar soared to a high of 146 yen from 142.98
yen late Monday and to 1.7130 West German marks from 1.6770 marks
the day before. The dollar eased somewhat by late afternoon but did
not give up all its gains.
   ``It reached panic proportions,'' said Mike Ballow, a currency
markets analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The move was
incredible and probably irrational.''
   Richard Levine, vice president for precious metals and foreign
exchange at Elders Futures Inc., said, ``I don't think the rumor
can be denied or confirmed, but I think the market's reaction to
even the possibility of further instability really tells us the
story: That when push comes to shove, if one has to hold currency
there's no safer currency in the world than the U.S. dollar.''
   At the very least, the Gorbachev scare gave traders the
opportunity to reverse the dollar's recent direction.
   ``I think the central banks have artificially kept the dollar
down by their relentless intervention'' through dollar-selling,
Levine said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.25 Japanese yen from 143.22
yen Monday. Later in London it rose to 144.05 yen. In New York, the
dollar settled at 144.65 yen, up 1.669 yen from late Monday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6830 from $1.6775 late
Monday. In New York, it fell to $1.6725, down from $1.6810 Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday
rates, included: 1.6990 West German marks, up from 1.6770; 1.5005
Swiss francs, up from 1.4815; 5.7620 French francs, up from 5.6950;
1,260.50 Italian lire, up from 1,248.00; and 1.1865 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1871.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Monday:
1.6805 West German marks, up from 1.6795; 1.4890 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4860; 5.7040 French francs, unchanged; 1.8880 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8865; 1,249.50 Italian lire, down from
1,249.75; 1.1902 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1888
   The late bid price of gold in London was unchanged from Monday's
close at $418.50 a troy ounce.
   In Zurich, gold rose to $419, up from $418.50 bid late Monday.
   After a weeklong break on the Hong Kong gold market, the metal
rose $9.04 to close at a bid $416.35. The market last traded Jan.
24 before the Lunar New Year holiday.
   Silver prices were unchanged to lower. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery finished at $5.207 a troy
ounce, down from $5.215 a troy ounce Monday. In London, silver
bullion was unchanged from Monday, closing at a late bid price of
$5.22.

   Timeplex Inc., a Unisys Corp. subsidiary, on
Tuesday announced new products to connect computers that it says
are vastly quicker at transferring data than existing systems.
   Timeplex says its computer networking products can speed the
time of transferring complex computer data, such as a
three-dimensional representation of a product, to about 30 seconds
from the current 12 to 15 minutes.
   It says the systems would be useful in engineering applications
as well as at financial institutions and other companies where vast
amounts of data are moved from one computer to another, either
across the room or across the country.
   Timeplex, based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said the products
already are being used by the Strategic Air Command at Offutt Air
Force Base, Omaha, Neb., for the new SAC Intelligence Network, a
new communications network.
   The systems allow the transmittal of so-called broadband data,
which contain more information than narrow-band data.

<HEAD>Sugar Futures Plummet After Early Rally Fails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Sugar futures prices fell sharply Tuesday on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange after a rally prompted by a reduced world
production forecast sputtered and failed.
   On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures fell;
energy futures were mostly lower; livestock and meat futures were
mixed; and precious metal futures retreated.
   Sugar futures settled .36 cent to .46 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in March down .43 cent at 14.44 cents a pound.
   The market rallied strongly early in the session after the West
German statistical firm F.O. Licht released a revised 1989-90 world
sugar production forecast of 106.5 million metric tons, about 1.2
million tons below its previous estimate.
   Licht said crops in several countries had not lived up to
expectations, and the resulting tightening of supplies created the
potential for explosive upward price movement if a large consumer
country such as the Soviet Union, China or India were to enter the
world market as a buyer.
   Unconfirmed rumors of Soviet buying kept traders on edge last
week.
   Tuesday's rally pushed the March contract's price up to 15.05
cents a pound, but buyers turned sellers when it became apparent
the March price would not top its lifetime high of 15.38 cents.
   ``The thing just fed on itself and we had the market ending flat
on its face,'' said Arthur Stevenson, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   From a fundamental perspective, he said, the initial response to
the Licht report may have been tempered by expectations that an
upcoming companion report will predict a decline in world sugar
consumption.
   Grain and soybean futures settled moderately lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade following a report that Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev might resign as Communist Party chairman.
   The mid-afternoon report on the Cable News Network stirred fears
of a change in the Soviet Union toward more isolationist policies
and less foreign trade, including fewer purchases of foreign grain.
   The report overshadowed bullish sentiments linked to Monday's
strong rebound in the soybean market, which some analysts had said
could mark a turnaround in the market's six-week decline.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2} cents lower with the contract
for delivery in March at $3.76 a bushel; corn futures were { cent
to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were \ cent
to 1 cent lower with March at $1.37\ a bushel; soybeans were 1}
cents to 5 cents lower with March at $5.58{ a bushel.
   Energy futures ended mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
inventory report, which showed larger-than-expected supplies across
the board.
   The API reported a smaller-than-expected 678,000-barrel decline
in crude-oil supplies last week, a 7.3-million-barrel increase in
gasoline supplies and a 4.7-million-barrel rise in supplies of
petroleum distillates, which include home heating oil.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 5 cents to 34
cents lower with March at $22.46 a barrel; heating oil was 1.04
cent lower to .05 cent higher with February at 60.51 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .09 cent to .55 cent lower with
February at 62.73 cents a gallon.
   Pork-belly futures fell sharply for the third straight day on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid continuing concerns about weak
demand, high slaughter rates and low cash prices.
   Live cattle settled unchanged to .65 cent higher with February
at 79.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent lower to .20
cent higher with March at 83.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .15
cent lower to .27 cent higher with February at 49.42 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.30 cent lower with February
at 50.90 cents a pound.
   In precious-metals trading on New York's Commodity Exchange,
gold finished 70 cents to $1.20 lower with February at $418.10 a
troy ounce; silver was 0.8 cent to 1.4 cents lower with February at
$5.207 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Offer to Sweeten Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Utah businessman who missed a deadline to
submit a bid for Aristech Chemical Corp. said Tuesday he hasn't
given up hope and might sweeten his offer.
   Salt Lake City chemicals magnate Jon Huntsman has asked Aristech
to set a new Feb. 14 deadline to give him time to review financial
data and form a joint venture with General Electric Co.'s GE
Plastics division, based in Pittsfield, Mass.
   The 50-50 joint venture could enable Huntsman to offer at least
$27 a share, or $934.2 million, for the Pittsburgh-based company,
according to a letter Huntsman sent Tuesday to Aristech board
member R.S. Evans. His earlier $25 a share offer was spurned.
   ``I want to emphasize to the special committee and the entire
board that we genuinely want to acquire Aristech,'' said Huntsman's
letter, which was publicly released. ``The fact is, however, that
it is not reasonable for you to expect us to make our formal
proposal until we have had a reasonable period of time to complete
a reasonable due diligence review of your company.''
   A deadline set by a special Aristech board committee expired at
5 p.m. Monday. The company's stock remained unchanged at $25.25 at
the close of trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The committee set the deadline after Aristech managers and
Mitsubishi Corp. of Japan said their $26-a-share offer, worth
$899.6 million, would expire at the end of business Tuesday. The
senior management group is led by Aristech Chairman Thomas Marshall.
   Mitsubishi spokesman Peter Rosenthal declined to comment Tuesday
on the status of that offer.
   Aristech spokesmen David Higie and Harry Varner also declined
comment Tuesday.
   Aristech, which employs about 1,800 people in eight states, has
reserved the option of rejecting any of the first-round offers and
suggested that if none is high enough it will reopen bidding.
   In his letter, Huntsman said he needs to see more Aristech
financial records to finalize an offer.
   After signing a confidentiality agreement Jan. 24, Huntsman
received ``certain limited financial information on Aristech,'' his
letter said. ``However, as we have advised you, we need access to
considerable additional information and people.''
   Huntsman also complained he hasn't had time to visit Aristech's
facilities, review various documents at the company's headquarters,
meet with the company's independent auditors or talk with most of
the company's senior officers.

   The Limited Inc. said Tuesday it is moving
headquarters of the 720-store Lane Bryant division from New York to
a Columbus suburb so it can be in a better position to help the
specialty women's apparel chain improve.
   Kenneth B. Gilman, executive vice president and chief financial
officer for the Columbus-based parent company, said the move
involving 240 jobs did not reflect a decision to cut costs.
   ``It was a desire to improve the performance of that business,''
Gilman said.
   Gilman said he did not know how many of the buyers, accountants
and other Lane Bryant employees would transfer from New York when
the new headquarters opens in May or June of 1991.
   Three other New York-based divisions _ Henri Bendel, Brylane and
Lerner, which together employ 800 to 1,000 people _ will remain in
New York.
   ``They operate well in that environment. We think Lane Bryant,
which has, I think, suffered a bit in recent years, would benefit
from being located in the central Ohio area,'' Gilman said.
   The Limited and all other divisions are based in Columbus.
   ``Our plans for Lane Bryant include building that business to
achieve sales in excess of $2 billion. It's somewhat less than $1
billion at this point. When we achieve that goal, of course, the
home office work force will be significantly higher than 240,''
Gilman said.
   Donald Trott, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said Lane
Bryant has been struggling to find its ``fashion identity'' in
trying to appeal to customers who prefer contemporary designs and
thoses who are conservative.
   ``The sales have not kept pace with the other major divisions of
The Limited,'' he said. ``The challenge has been in trying to find
some middle ground ... of direction.''
   The Limited operates 3,176 specialty apparel stores nationwide
through The Limited, Express, Victoria's Secret, Henri Bendel,
Lerner, Lane Bryant, and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. It also distributes
through the Victoria's Secret, Lerner, Lane Bryant and Roaman's
catalogues.
   The Limited acquired Lane Bryant in 1982.

   Centrust Savings Bank on Tuesday asked the American
Stock Exchange to halt trading in Centrust shares while the thrift
revises its financial statement, which had been criticized by
federal regulators.
   The bank reported a $119 million loss in its report for the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Its stock would have resumed trading
Tuesday following a five-day suspension ordered by the Office of
Thrift Supervision, which alleged CenTrust filed inaccurate and
misleading financial statements.
   Centrust continues to deny the substance of the OTS allegations,
but nevertheless will amend its report to respond to the
regulator's comments, according to a statement the savings bank
released Tuesday afternoon.
   The revised report should be submitted on or about February 1,
and Centrust officials have asked that trading be halted until the
report is filed. The amended report will not change Centrust's $119
million loss or other previously reported financial results, bank
officials said.
   Centrust stock closed at 75 cents before the OTS suspension was
imposed. It was halted on the American Stock Exchange before
trading began Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, Florida banking regulators expect to continue
assisting a federal probe into junk bond trading practices at
CenTrust.
   The State Comptrollers Office has provided documents to
Securities and Exchange Commission investigators looking into a
trading network involving CenTrust, Lincoln Savings and Loan of
Irvine, Calif., and others, comptroller spokesman Terrence McElroy
said Tuesday.
   The SEC is examining an alleged ``daisy chain'' operation in
which Centrust bought hundreds of millions in high-risk bonds and
participated in several securities trades with junk bond whiz
Michael Milken and Lincoln executive Charles Keating Jr. Milken and
some thrifts allegedly rotated junk bonds and stock sales among
themselves to manipulate profits.

   Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds surged Tuesday
following an unconfirmed report that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev was considering resigning as Communist Party chief.
   Government bonds, which had been down as much as &rsqb; point,
boomeranged after the mid-afternoon report and finished with gains
of up to \ point.
   The Treasury's closely watched 8&lsqb; percent 30-year bond finished
9-32 higher, a gain of about $2.81 per $1,000 face amount. That
pushed the yield down to 8.55 percent from 8.57 percent Monday.
   The junk bond market, which declined sharply last Friday and
again Monday, stabilized Tuesday because of a recovery in the price
of high-yield bonds issued by RJR Nabisco.
   An unconfirmed report by Cable News Network around 2 p.m. EST
said Gorbachev may step down as party leader but retain his post as
president.
   ``It was predominately the Gorbachev report that moved it up,''
said Bob Sbarra, senior vice president at Carroll McEntee &amp;
McGinley Inc.
   Market professionals accounted for most of the buying, Sbarra
said.
   The CNN report also pushed the dollar sharply higher,
reinforcing the recovery in bonds, dealers said. A stronger dollar
makes U.S. bonds more attractive for foreign investors.
   If the Gorbachev report turns out to be true, ``the market
effects will not be lasting,'' Sbarra speculated. Such a
resignation would merely mirror events elsewhere in Eastern Europe,
where some leaders have resigned from Communist parties but hung on
to government positions, he said.
   Treasuries had weakened in the morning following Congressional
testimony by Alan Greenspan in which the Federal Reserve chairman
warned that inflation remained unacceptably high and said that the
risk of recession had eased.
   The comments dampened hopes that the Fed might lower interest
rates any time soon, said Gary Schlossberg, senior economist at
Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in San Francisco. ``It's bearish for the
market,'' he said.
   In the secondary market for Treasuries, prices of short-term
bonds gained 1-16 to 5-32, intermediate maturities rose 1-8 to 7-32
and long-term issues advanced as much as 9-32 point, according to
Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.49 to 1,157.82.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.99 percent from
their level at auction Monday as the discount was off 3 basis
points at 7.74 percent. Yields on six-month bills auctioned Monday
fell to 8.12 percent as the discount dropped 2 basis points to 7.71
percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.06 percent as the
discount declined 4 basis points to 7.52 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was at 8\ percent, unchanged from late
Monday.
   In the corporate bond market, prices of high-yield issues, or
junk bonds, steadied after two days of big declines. A recover in
the price of bonds issued by RJR Nabisco Inc., the bellwether for
the market, helped stabilize prices, said Alan Schlesinger, head of
junk bond trading at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   RJR Nabisco's 13.71 percent bonds due 2007 rose about 3~ to 63{
and its 13.71 percent bonds due 2009 rose about 2~ to 68{. The
bonds had fallen as much as 20 points, or $200 for each $1,000 face
amount, over the past two days.
   Among other widely traded junk bonds, Kroger's 13&lsqb;s due 2001
gained \ to 101{ bid.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 12-32 point. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.47 percent from 7.44 percent late Monday.

   In some ways, Peter Cohen fell victim to the
same problems as several prominent takeover stategists: He had big
dreams for his company but ran into trouble after big acquisitions
failed to bring the success he expected.
   Cohen, who resigned Tuesday as chairman of Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., built the company from a largely retail brokerage into
the second-biggest investment firm on Wall Street.
   The company that started as Shearson Hayden Stone Inc. took over
Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc. in 1984 and E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. in
1988 and became a powerhouse.
   The 43-year-old Cohen, who joined one of the firm's predecessors
in 1971, rose through the ranks to become chief executive officer
in 1983 and chairman one year later.
   Shearson and Cohen were riding high when the stock market crash
of Oct. 19, 1987, interrupted Wall Street's great bull run and sent
Shearson profits skidding.
   Cohen tried with little success to patch things up recently with
a senior management shakeup, 800 layoffs and a reduction in broker
commissions. But the chairman himself has made some strategic
blunders that didn't help his firm's recovery.
   Perhaps the most notorious came in 1988 when Cohen sided with
RJR Nabisco Inc. President F. Ross Johnson in Johnson's
multibillion-dollar attempt to take the food and tobacco company
private.
   Cohen tried and failed to cut a deal with Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. for a joint bid, and then went down to defeat with
Johnson against KKR's winning $25 billion offer.
   Cohen, a New Yorker born in 1946, attended Ohio State University
and the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.
   After a short stint at Reynolds Securities Inc., he joined
CWBL-Hayden Stone Inc. in 1971 and spent seven years there.
Following a one-year hiatus at Republic National Bank, he returned
to Shearson in 1979.
   Once chairman, Cohen went about expanding the investment firm
into the merger and acquisition field with the blessing of parent
company American Express, which acquired Shearson in 1981.
   At first, most of Shearson's merchant banking business came from
small deals and takeover strategists considered corporate raiders,
including Asher Edelman.
   The company did have several big successes, including two
pairings with Kohlberg Kravis: the $2.43 billion leveraged buyout
of Jim Walter Corp. and the $1.2 billion LBO of Stop &amp; Shop Cos.
   In 1988, Shearson was an equity partner in the $1.8 billion
buyout of Koppers Co. by the British firm Beazer PLC. But the deal,
which began as a hostile bid, earned Shearson, and American
Express, a lot of bad press in Pennsylvania, Koppers' home state.
   Cohen saw the RJR Nabisco deal as a chance to put his firm on
top among investment bankers, and make enough money in fees to help
its sagging bottom line. However, the failure of the Johnson offer
remained a black mark for Shearson and Cohen.

<HEAD>States File Suit Against Asbestos Companies in U.S. Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-nine states sued 26 asbestos companies
Tuesday, claiming the companies have a duty to reduce hazards
created by the substance.
   The suit filed with the U.S. Supreme Court asks it to find the
defendants liable for the cost of abating asbestos hazards in
public buildings and order restitution to the states, said
Washington Attorney General Kenneth Eikenberry.
   ``We are alleging that the defendants had the responsibility to
provide products that were safe for their intended uses or warn the
states of the danger posed by their products. They did neither,''
said Eikenberry, who is acting as lead attorney in the case.
   ``The products installed in state buildings simply were not safe
and the states must expend significant sums of money to provide a
safe environment.''
   It is unusual for suits to be filed directly with the nation's
high court, but the states did so in this case because the issue
``raises major public health, environment and finance issues and no
other adequate forum exists where all the defendants could be sued
and the resources equitably apportioned after finding liability,''
said a press release from Eikenberry's office.
   Eikenberry said Washington has been seeking payment for its
asbestos-abatement projects. The state recently filed claims
totaling $927,938 with the Manville Trust, which was created after
the Johns-Manville Co., another asbestos manufacturer, filed for
protection under the federal bankruptcy laws, he said.
   The state anticipates having to spend about $490 million to
reduce the asbestos in its buildings.
   The estimate for eliminating asbestos hazards in all public and
commercial buildings across the country ranges from $51 billion to
$750 billion, the press release said.
   Asbestos is a fibrous material that was used widely as
fireproofing and insulation in buildings around the country. Fibers
from the material, if inhaled, can lodge in the lungs and cause
asbestosis and other diseases.
   Matt Gonring, spokesman for USG Corp. in Chicago, one of the
defendants, said he could not comment on the lawsuit because USG
officials had not seen it.
   Calls to several other defendant companies failed to reach
officials qualified to comment.
   Defendants in the case are W.R. Grace &amp; Co., National Gypsum
Co., United States Gypsum Co., USG Corp., American Biltrite Inc.,
Armstrong World Industries Inc., Azrock Industries Inc., Basic
Inc., Carey-Canada Inc., The Celotex Corp., Certainteed Corp.,
Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co. Inc., Eagle-Picher Industries Inc.
   Also Fibreboard Corp., The Flintkote Co., GAF Corp., Georgia
Pacific Corp., H.K. Porter Inc., Keene Corp., Kentile Floors Inc.,
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., Owens-Illinois Inc., Pfizer Inc.,
Raymark Industries Inc., Sprayed Insulation Inc. and Turner &amp;
Newell Ltd.
   Other states involved in the lawsuit are Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New
Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and

   Hilton Hotels Corp. directors, who
hung out a for-sale sign last summer, faced a tough decision
Tuesday: accept a much lower offer than expected, restructure the
lodging-casino company or take down the sign.
   Hilton's board met to consider those alternatives, but the
company gave no assurances that any decision would be reached
Tuesday.
   The meeting ``may go tomorrow and it may go the day beyond
that,'' said the company's general counsel, William C. Lebo Jr.,
adding that it was possible there would be no announcement from the
board meeting at all.
   In announcing the meeting, Hilton had said the directors would
``consider a number of alternatives for the company, including
proposals to acquire the company, as well as restructuring
alternatives which would not involve a sale of the company.''
   Hilton said it was possible it would not pursue any of the
alternatives.
   Hilton stock was trading at $63 a share when Barron Hilton, son
of founder Conrad Hilton, settled a dispute over his father's
estate last May. When the hotel-casino chain put itself up for sale
last summer, analysts said Hilton might fetch $120 a share or more.
   The stock soared to a high of $115.50 last August, and Lebo
indicated that Hilton had been contacted by potential buyers from
around the world, particularly Asia.
   However, sources of junk bond and bank financing began to dry
up, and reports in The Wall Street Journal indicated that the Asian
bidders had dropped out and that the highest bids for Hilton were
in the $90-a-share range.
   On Jan. 24, the stock plunged $8.75 to close at $65.50 on rumors
that one of those offers, from JMB Realty Corp. in Chicago, had
been lowered or withdrawn.
   Hilton shares continued to slide this week, closing at $57.75
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange _ precisely half their high
last August.

   The nation's financial markets were rocked
Tuesday by a cable television report that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev was considering resigning as Communist party chief.
   The report by Cable News Network's Moscow bureau immediately
sent the dollar climbing against foreign currencies and spurred a
rebound in the bond market, traders said. Stock prices gyrated
wildly and oil futures prices also rallied.
   In almost every case, the moves were short-lived as the report
remained unconfirmed through the close of the markets in the United
States.
   ``It was a dull day before it happened,'' said William Hand, a
trader with First Pennsylvania Bank in Philadelphia.
   The report by CNN around 2 p.m. EST said Gorbachev may step down
as party leader but retain his post as president. CNN quoted
sources as saying the move would allow Gorbachev to distance
himself from the party amid internal turmoil in the Soviet Union.
   In Washington, Secretary of State James A. Baker said the report
was ``a rumor, and therefore it's not something that I think that
we should respond to or react to.
   ``We're following the story, as I know you are, and we'll have a
comment if we ever determine it's something more than just a
rumor,'' said Baker.
   The same day, Baker's spokeswoman announced that talks in Moscow
between Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
have been postponed a day to Feb. 8-9 to avoid interfering with a
meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   Bush administration officials and intelligence sources told The
Associated Press that there has been speculation for weeks that
Gorbachev would yield his party post _ while retaining the
presidency _ but that they had no information he would take the
step.
   In currency markets, the dollar soared to a high of 146 yen in
New York from 142.98 yen late Monday and to 1.7130 West German
marks from 1.6770 marks the day before. The dollar eased somewhat
by late afternoon but did not give up all its gains.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond finished 9-32 of a
point higher, a gain of about $2.81 per $1,000 face amount. The
bond markets had been slumping for weeks.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, prices were so volatile that
traders at one brokerage temporarily stopped trading until calm was
restored. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been sliding
during the afternoon, fell more sharply after the Gorbachev report
before recovering some lost ground by the end of the day.
   At 2:30 p.m. EST, the Dow was reported off 27.25 points. It
rebounded into the plus column briefly, then fell back to finish
down 10.14 points for the day at 2,543.24.
   In the energy markets, prices for crude oil futures spiked
higher on the Gorbachev report but finished lower with the the
contract for March delivery of West Texas Intermediate off 34 cents
to $22.46 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Much of the frenetic activity was stirred by uncertainty over
what would happen to the Soviet and world economies should
Gorbachev step down. The financial markets typically react to a
range of news reports and rumors.
   ``If he steps down, if he loses his stature, if somebody else
gains stature _ who knows what happens,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist at Nikko Securities International Inc. in New York.
   The rise in the dollar against foreign currencies and bond
prices was attributed to the perception that U.S. financial
instruments are a safe haven in times of turmoil.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock of UAL Corp. took another nosedive
Tuesday, falling below the price at which it traded before takeover
bids for the parent United Airlines first surfaced last June.
   Analysts blamed the stock's tailspin on growing skepticism about
the likelihood of any new takeover attempt succeeding. Arbitragers
expecting a takeover at a higher price had held large positions in
UAL stock.
   UAL plunged $15.50 a share to close at $121 on the New York York
Stock Exchange.
   Since Thursday, UAL stock has tumbled from $164. The stock
reached a high of $294 back in September when United pilots were
working on a $300-a-share buyout bid. That attempt collapsed for
lack of financing, helping to trigger a 190-point drop in the Dow
Jones industrial average in October.
   ``What we've seen in the last three days is continued arbitrage
selling and firms closing arbitrage departments,'' said Samuel
Buttrick, a New York analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``Layer that in with Moody downgrading RJR (Nabisco) securities,
uncertainty in the high-yield market, all the trouble with deal
stocks, and you create a weak backdrop.''
   The price of RJR Nabisco's high-yield bonds plunged on Friday
and Monday after Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings on
the securities. The decline spread gloom throughout the markets
about the ability of the junk bond market to provide financing for
major takeovers.
   Nevertheless, Buttrick said the drop in UAL's share price could
make it easier to arrange a buyout because the price would be
cheaper.
   ``It's basic math _ it makes it easier to do,'' he said.
   UAL and United's unions declined comment on the stock price drop.
   The airline's pilots, flight attendants and machinists last
Wednesday proposed to buy 75 percent of Chicago-based UAL and leave
the remaining shares in public hands. The employees are negotiating
as a unit with representatives of UAL's board to develop a formal
buyout offer, but the process could take months.
   On Thursday, UAL reported a 67 percent drop in its
fourth-quarter profit, blaming the poor showing on takeover-related
costs, high fuel expenses and an industry-wide decline in ridership.

   Fuller Industries has purchased the
Fuller Brush Division of the Sara Lee Corp., a move that will unite
the manufacturer of Fuller brushes with the group that markets them.
   ``We are delighted that this opportunity came available and
believe that by concentrating our efforts we can continue to

   The purchase price was not disclosed.
   Fuller Industries was formed last June when a group of Kansas

Great Bend. The transaction announced Tuesday involves the Fuller
Brush direct sales and retail divisions.
   Fuller Brush has about 12,000 independent sales representatives

   Sara Lee said it wanted to concentrate on its food products and

<HEAD>Scott Paper Earnings Drop 11.5 Percent In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scott Paper Co. blamed continued high pulp
costs and mechanical breakdowns in its printing paper business for
an 11.5 percent drop in profit in the final quarter of 1989.
   The company said it earned $71.6 million, or 97 cents a share,
on sales of $1.293 billion from October through December. For the
same period in 1988, Scott made profits of $80.9 million, or $1.05
a share, on sales of $1.285 billion.
   For the full year, Scott's earnings fell 6.3 percent to $375.5
million, or $5.11 a share, from $400.9 million, or $5.23 a share.
Sales rose to $5.06 billion from $4.73 billion.
   Philip E. Lippincott, chairman and chief executive, said the
1989 results were ``dissappointing.''
   Besides higher pulp costs and equipment failures at S.D. Warren
printing and publshing, Lippencott said price controls in Mexico
and costs associated with the company's food-service investment in
Europe also hurt earnings.
   ``Demand for our personal care and cleaning products and our
printing and publishing papers is strong, and I remain convinced
that our strategies are sound,'' Lippencott said. ``Yet it is clear
we have to do a better job of implementing our growth strategies
and meeting our manufacturing objectives.''
   In 1989, the company's earnings included a gain of $1 a share on
the sale of timberlands in Washington and other items. The earnings
in 1988 included a gain of $1.22 a share, partially from the sale
of Scott's interest in Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co.

   Property owners around Rocky Flats and two unions
sued two former operators of the nuclear weapons plant Tuesday,
alleging that slipshod treatment of hazardous wastes caused
environmental and health problems.
   In Ohio, a $2 billion lawsuit was filed against a former
operator of another federally owned weapons materials factory, the
Fernald uranium processing plant. NLO Inc. and its parent company
were accused of subjecting employees to a hazardous, radioactive
workplace.
   In U.S. District Court in Denver, two class-action lawsuits
alleged that Rockwell International Corp. and its predecessor, Dow
Chemical Co., were careless and negligent in the treatment of
hazardous wastes at Rocky Flats.
   Their actions resulted in repeated releases of both radioactive
and non-radioactive hazardous substances into the environment and
violations of state and federal environmental health and safety
laws, the lawsuits alleged.
   Five residents near the plant west of Denver filed one of the
lawsuits on behalf of about 10,000 property owners within a
five-mile radius of Rocky Flats and up to 50,000 people who live
within six miles of the plant.
   Rocky Flats, which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons and has been in operation since 1953, is 16 miles northwest
of Denver and is near the cities of Arvada, Westminster, Broomfield
and Golden.
   Dow Chemical operated the plant from 1953 until June 30, 1975,
when Rockwell took over. Last year, the Department of Energy
replaced Rockwell with EG&amp;G Inc. after the FBI and the
Environmental Protection Agency raided Rocky Flats, looking for
evidence of illegal disposal of hazardous wastes.
   In their lawsuit, the property owners asked the court to issue
an order preventing further releases of plutonium and radioactive
and non-radioactive hazardous substances from Rocky Flats.
   The other lawsuit was filed by the Building and Construction
Trades Department, AFL-CIO, and the Construction Trades Council on
behalf of more than 10,000 current and former workers at the plant.
   That suit asks the court to order the defendants to create a
fund to finance reasonable medical monitoring and surveillance
services, including independent scientific studies of adverse
health effects.
   Rockwell officials in El Segundo, Calif., declined to comment,
saying they had not seen the court documents. Dow Chemical
officials at company headquarters in Midland, Mich., did not reply
to calls seeking comment.
   Several property owners named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit
declined to comment, referring questions to their attorneys.
   ``We think the lawsuits are historic. It's time to abandon the
public relations games surrounding Rocky Flats,'' Bob Ozinga,
business manager of the Colorado Building and Construction Trades
Council, said in a statement.
   ``Hopefully, the lawsuits will benefit the workers, the
community and the plant's operations,'' Ozinga said.
   Attorney Bruce H. DeBoskey, who is representing all the
plaintiffs, said the lawsuits ``stem from people's concern and
their fear over whether or not they have lost money and whether or
not their health has been affected by the operations at the plant.''
   ``That fear was heightened by the FBI raid last summer,''
DeBoskey said in a telephone interview. ``People are afraid.
They're afraid and they want to know the truth from people other
than the ones who have caused the pollution.''
   DOE last year identified Rocky Flats as the most hazardous site
in the nation's nuclear weapons complex, saying toxic chemicals
contaminated an underground reservoir and threatened nearby city
water supplies.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins suspended plutonium processing
operations at Rocky Flats in November. He said the shutdown would
remain in effect until DOE is convinced safety and health standards
are being met.
   The Ohio lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati,
accused NLO and parent NL Industries Inc. of failing to properly
store or contain highly radioactive substances at the Feed
Materials Production Center in Fernald.
   The plant, located in Fernald 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati,
processes uranium for use in the Energy Department's production
elsewhere of nuclear weapons.
   The lawsuit says the employees suffered loss of income,
emotional distress including increased fear of cancer, and
diminished ability to obtain other jobs or insurance.
   It seeks $2 billion in damages plus unspecified punitive damages
and payment for extended medical monitoring of the employees.
   Cincinnati lawyer Thomas Kircher, who filed the lawsuit, said he
is asking U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel to declare it a
class-action lawsuit on behalf of all former NLO employees in
addition to subcontractors who worked there while NLO operated the
plant from 1952 to 1985.
   NLO turned over operation of the Department of Energy plant to
Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio in 1986.
   Bob Weidner, NLO's manager in suburban Cincinnati, declined to
comment on the lawsuit, saying he had not seen a copy.

<HEAD>Truck Maker Reports Big Gain in 4th Qtr Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>

   PACCAR Inc. said its earnings more than
doubled in the fourth quarter because of a $52 million one-time
gain, but predicted lower production this year because of weakening
demand for its trucks.
   The maket of Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks also reported record
sales and profits for the full year on Monday.
   PACCAR had profits of $98.9 million or $2.83 a share in the last
three months of 1989, compared with earnings of $46.4 million or
$1.30 a share in the comparable period a year earlier.
   The latest quarter's profits include a $52.4 million after-tax
gain from the sale of PACCAR's Wagner Mining Equipment Co. division
and a fleet of rail cars.
   Revenues slipped to $861.8 million in the quarter from $884.6
million a year earlier.
   For the year, net income increased 37 percent to $241.9 million
or $6.90 a share from $175.8 million or $4.90 a share. Revenues
rose 7 percent to $3.52 billion from $3.27 billion.
   PACCAR became the largest U.S. manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks
in 1989, said chairman and chief executive officer Charles M.
Pigott.
   Demand for new trucks dropped significantly in the second half
of the year, but PACCAR had enough backlog to stay at
near-capacity, he said.
   Lower production is anticipated this year because of the
weakening demand, he said.
