   Atlantis streaked toward a Sunday
landing after its crew put into orbit a spy satellite designed to
fly over parts of the Soviet Union never before observed from a
shuttle-launched craft, NASA sources said.
   The five-man, all-military crew released the $500 million,
37,300-pound satellite from the shuttle's cargo bay Thursday, a day
after liftoff, the sources said.
   ``The crew is doing well and orbiter Atlantis continues to
perform satisfactorily,'' the space agency said in a statement.
   Because of a Pentagon blackout on the secret mission, the only
other word from NASA was that the shuttle is expected to land
Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. Sources speaking on
condition of anonymity put landing time at 1:34 p.m. EST.
   NASA technicians planned to spend several days assessing the
shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which arrived Thursday at a NASA
hangar at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, said agency
spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   The boosters dropped off two minutes after launch, as expected,
as the spacecraft lifted off early Wednesday on the highest
inclination ever traveled by a shuttle. The boosters fell into the
Atlantic 169 miles from Kennedy Space Center and were towed back by
two ships.
   A failed joint in a booster was blamed for the Challenger
disaster in 1986 that killed seven astronauts.
   The 62-degree inclination allows the satellite to cover most of
the Soviet Union, including far northern regions with heavy
concentrations of ships and submarines and several missile bases.
The satellite is designed to take high-resolution photographs and
eavesdrop on electronic communications around the world, sources
said.
   The satellite and other reconnaissance spacecraft will be
important in verifying whether the Soviets are complying with
U.S.-Soviet arms agreements. The Soviets have similar satellites
over the United States.
   Atlantis is the sixth of 34 shuttle missions dedicated solely to
the military.
   Navy Capt. John O. Creighton is Atlantis' commander. The other
crew members are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and
mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.

   Fire broke out in a luxury hotel's tent
restaurant early Thursday and wind-whipped flames leaped to the
main building, killing 16 people and injuring about 70. An American
retiree was among the dead.
   Frantic guests at the six-story Heliopolis Sheraton jumped out
windows and clambered down bedsheets that were tied together. Many
of the injuries were broken bones suffered in falls.
   While a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman refused to release any
information on the the victim, the American was identified late
Thursday as Robert D. Cresap of Houston, said his sister-in-law,
Mrs. Alfred Cresap of Sioux City, Iowa.
   Cresap, 67, was a retired accountant who had arrived Wednesday
in Cairo with his wife, Helen, his sister-in-law told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Three Americans were seriously injured, said police Brig.
Abdel-Rehim el-Kenawy in the blaze, which broke out at 1 a.m. and
burned for nine hours. By early afternoon, after the last flames
had been put out and the smoke extinguished, guests were returning
to retrieve belongings.
   As people carried soggy luggage out of the ruined building,
rescue teams were seen carrying out at least four bodies.
   The hotel northeast of Cairo had no fire alarms or a sprinklers,
and many guests heard of the fire from other guests.
   Tourism Minister Fuad Sultan said the blaze started accidentally
in the Nubian Tent restaurant _ a cotton canvas tent attached to
one of the three blocks of the T-shaped hotel. The head of Cairo's
fire brigade, Maj. Gen. Adel Nigm, said such tents are fire hazards
and the Sheraton put it up without consulting the fire department.
   Sparks jumped from a clay oven to the ceiling of the tent,
igniting flames that quickly spread to the hotel, said Sultan.
   Cairo Gov. Mahmoud Sherif told the official Middle East News
Agency the use of such tents at hotels would be reviewed. A fire
broke out in a similar tent at the Nile-side Guezira Sheraton about
a year ago but was quickly extinguished with no casualties.
   The Helioplis Sheraton, about 10 years old, is the only one of
Egypt's six Sheratons without an alarm system or sprinklers. Sultan
said they are not mandatory under Egyptian law, but most
first-class hotels began installing them in 1987.
   Winds of nearly 25 mph fed the flames, which destroyed much of
the 630-room hotel, including its restaurants and elaborate lobby,
where live birds flew among tropical plants and trees. Later in the
day, people crowded around the still-standing front desk, asking
for passports and belongings.
   There were about 1,000 guests and 300 employees in the hotel at
the time of the fire. It was not known how many people were inside
the Nubian Tent, where belly dancing and other entertainment is
featured.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Bahaa el-Din Ibrahim said
the 16 dead included eight French nationals and two Finns. British
Embassy spokesman James Short said four British nationals were
unaccounted for.
   At the hotel, a senior security official, Maj. Gen. Ali
el-Kubtan, said rooms had been ``90 percent checked'' and left open
the possibility that more victims might be found.
   ``I was at the counter when I saw smoke coming from the
direction of the Nubian Tent,'' a hotel receptionist said. ``In
just five minutes the entire lobby area was on fire. The flames
spread very, very quickly.''
   Fred Pirkey of Atlanta said he was asleep in a sixth-floor room
when his wife got up and noticed ``some orange flames outside the
window.'' From there, they made it through the smoke to the third
floor, where a man was tying bedsheets together to attach to a
windowsill, he said.
   ``With his help, we got around 20 people down to the roof of the
ground floor below, from where we jumped to safety,'' said Pirkey,
57, who is on a two-week vacation. ``We are very fortunate to be
alive.''
   One of those who climbed down the makeshift rope was Robert
Louis Toohey, 72, of Battle Creek, Mich. He passed out on his way
down, but a man on the ground caught him. He was hospitalized for
smoke inhalation.
   ``One problem was that some guests opened their windows to see
what was going on,'' said Victor Lewis, assistant manager of the
Cairo Sheraton, flagship of the chian's six hotels in Egypt. ``As a
result, sparks went into their rooms driven by the strong winds.''
   Uninjured Heliopolis Sheraton guests sat together in the lobby
of a nearby hotel, some still in nightclothes.
   Annick Poussard of Paris, who was sightseeing with her three
children, described the fire as an ``inferno.''
   ``I saw flames from my window,'' she said. ``At first I thought
they were lights from the nightclub, but then the music stopped. I
opened the door and heard people shout fire. It was getting hot.''

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the Sandinista People's Army, not
the Nicaraguan army; it's the Sandinista Police, not the national
police; and it's Commander of the Revolution Tomas Borge's personal
fiefdom, not an apolitical Interior Ministry and secret service.
   The name, nature and size of Nicaragua's powerful and mammoth
military and paramilitary machine make up perhaps the touchiest
issue between the unseated Sandinista Front and the victorious
United National Opposition alliance.
   The leftist guerrilla group that has become a political party
and the coalition led by civilians and business people that swept
Sunday's elections each has its own idea of what a country's army
and paramilitary forces should be.
   And the two ideas could not be further apart.
   ``Within the framework established by the political
constitution, the Sandinista National Liberation Front will defend
the integrity of the Sandinista People's Army and the Interior
Ministry,'' President Daniel Ortega told about 15,000 Sandinista
supporters Tuesday.
   Coming from the leader of a defeated political party, that
statement alone served to show how much the Sandinista Front
regards the army and the ministry as private property.
   The crowd's reponse was just as telling: ``One single army!''
   When Sandinistas chant ``People power'' and ``One single army,''
they mean the merging of party, state and army, and the generous
distribution of weapons among the common folk, a concept that riles
civilian-minded UNO leaders.
   Weapons are plentiful and easily obtained. It seems every
household has an AK-47 or a Soviet-made Makarov pistol.
   ``The UNO government is a government by the will of the people
and not because of Mr. Ortega's decisions,'' said Vice
President-elect Virgilio Godoy. ``Let that be very clear.''
   Recruits receive political indoctrination along with military
training in both institutions, which are commonly regarded as two
separate armies _ one under Ortega's brother, Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega, and the Interior Ministry under Borge.
   The setup was not coincidental.
   Borge is a hard-liner compared to the Ortega brothers. The two
sides headed different factions of the Sandinista Front before the
July 1979 triumph of the revolution.
   Once in power, lines were drawn and the two forces were
established under different leaders to balance each other out.
   But President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of UNO made a
campaign promise to trim Nicaragua's armed forces, the largest in
Central America with an estimated 150,000 men and women and a heavy
drain on state resources, taking up to 40 percent of the national
budget.
   UNO leaders also want the armed forces depoliticized and the
name changed to reflect the values of a Western-style government,
where the armed forces remain in place regardless of which party is
leading the government.
   They want the two-year draft for boys age 16 dropped.
   It reminds Nicaraguans of the setup under dictator Anastasio
Somoza, for whom army, police and secret service were all one and
the same and serving him personally.
   Borge, who will be 60 in August, commands fierce personal
loyalties in the Interior Ministry.
   ``He is concerned about your well-being, he listens to you, he
asks about your family; you can see that he really cares about
you,'' a Sandinista cadre who occupies an important position in the
ministry said of Borge. ``I'd follow him anywhere.''
   Each army and ministry unit has a political officer, whose rank
may be lower but whose authority is always higher than the unit
leader. ``El politico's'' job is to impart doctrine, watch for
deviations in ideology, and handle outside inquiries, such as by
journalists.
   The Interior Ministry controls the Sandinista Police and also
cloak-and-dagger departments such as State Security, in charge of
domestic spying; Foreign and Clandestine Operations, and the
sinister F-8 Mass Organizations department.
   F-8 organized the feared turbas, shock troops used to break up
opposition demonstrations and stage ``spontaneous'' violent
protests against Sandinista opponents.
   President Ortega once called them ``turbas divinas'' or divine
mobs, and Nicaraguans spliced the two words into ``turbinas,'' or
turbines, a spontaneous attempt by the populace to deal with the
terror those groups inspire by mocking them.
   When Ortega threatens opponents with unleashing ``the people's
ire,'' every Nicaraguan knows he's refering to the turbinas.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who has been mediating between
UNO and the Sandinista government to smooth the road to transition,
said Gen. Ortega and Borge agreed to step down when Mrs. Chamorro
is inaugurated April 25.
   Some Nicaraguans, veterans of 10{ years of Sandinista rule, are
skeptical.
   ``They promise you one thing today and if it's not in their
interest tomorrow, they'll deny ever having even spoken to you,''
said one housewife. ``They'll never give up their weapons. That's
the basis of their power.''
   She insisted her name not be used. Such is the feeling of
intimidation that remains.

   Appropriately, a manned rocket
blasted off on the day of my retirement. I almost believe those who
kidded me that NASA delayed Atlantis all those days so it could be
that way.
   Manned rockets have been a great part of my life during the 31
years I have written about space for The Associated Press. It
started with the first one _ Alan Shepard's in 1961 _ and continued
through all 64 others, as Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and the space
shuttle streaked across the pages of history.
   I have been fortunate to report on a whole new era of mankind,
the Space Age, from its very outset to the present.
   My memories would fill volumes, but there are a few _ most
happy, some very sad _ that stand out.
   There was Shepard's brief leap across the threshhold of space;
John Glenn's epic orbital flight in 1962; the rendezvous, docking
and space walk missions of the Gemini program that perfected the
techniques for going to the moon; the close call with death that
Neil Armstrong and Dave Scott had when Gemini 8 spun out of control.
   Then, there was the 1967 launch pad fire that killed the first
Apollo crew; the recovery from the fire and the remarkable series
of Apollo flights, including Apollo 8's circling of the moon on
Christmas Eve, that led to man's first landing on the lunar surface
in 1969; the near-tragedy of Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank ruptured
near the moon and three men had to battle for their lives for three
days to get safely back to Earth.
   There were the Skylab space station flights lasting up to 84
days; the joint U.S.-Soviet mission in 1975; the string of 24 space
shuttle science, technology and science delivery and rescue flights
that ended with that terrible explosion of Challenger and the death
of seven astronauts in January, 1986. And there was the rebound
from that disaster and the beginning of a new string of shuttle
successes that reached nine with Atlantis' launch early Wednesday.
   The public focus has been on the astronaut flights. But I hold
special fondness for the unmanned satellites and spacecraft that
opened new frontiers and discovered unknown worlds and wondrous
things out there.
   There was the Echo in 1960, a giant balloon shining like a star
in the sky and pointing the way to a communications revolution in
space; the first Tiros weather satellite and the startling weather
photographs it radioed back; the early Explorer satellites that
mapped the radiation belts and other phenomena encircling our
globe; the Pioneer, Mariner, Magellan, Viking and Voyager robots
that probed the planets, revising centuries-old scientific theories.
   The highlight of all those years had to be the moment Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped onto the moon's Sea of
Tranquillity on Sunday, July 20, 1969.
   For eight years, ever since President Kennedy had set this
nation on a course to the moon, almost everything launched from
Cape Canaveral was a stepping stone to that goal. Mercury proved
man could survive in space. Gemini developed the procedures for
getting there. Almost every unmanned satellite carried devices to
measure radiation and other potential hazards along the route. The
unmanned Ranger, Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter spacecraft scouted the
lunar landing sites.
   When Armstrong and Aldrin set foot on the moon, it didn't hit me
at first. I was too busy writing. But hours later, as I stepped
outside the AP office, I looked up at the moon, felt a lump, and
said, ``By gosh, we did it.''
   Yes, the memories are there.
   After Wednesday's Atlantis' launch, several people asked me if I
would miss it.
   Yes, I said, I would. For 31 years I've covered one of history's
best stories. But at some point one has to assess his life and say
its time to move on and make way for someone else to cover the
history yet to come.
   And there is much to come. There will be space station Freedom
in the middle of this decade, and early in the next century
astronauts could be back on the moon and embarking for Mars.
   Those will be exciting days and I wish my successor, Marcia
Dunn, the best of luck.
   I'll still be close to the space program. On Thursday, I will
change hats and become executive director of the Mercury 7
Foundation, founded by the six surviving members of the original
seven astronauts to raise money for science and technology
scholarships.
   I will be located in the new Astronaut Hall of Fame Museum just
outside the gates of the Kennedy Space Center. The foundation
president and my boss will be Alan Shepard. Who would have thought
it 29 years ago when I watched him take wing?
   It's been a facinating ride.

   A raucous mob set a fire and brawled
outside the hotel where President Bush was speaking during his
visit Wednesday, and police made at least five arrests, authorities
said.
   Bush spoke at the post St. Francis Hotel at a fund-raising
dinner for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's run for governor.
   Outside the hotel in the heart of San Francisco's busy Union
Square shopping and theater district, about 1,000 people gathered
to protest or cheer the president.
   The crowd was well-behaved for a time. But riot police moved in
when two dozen torch-bearing protesters, some wearing bandanas as
masks, set a bonfire and watched the flames creep to within two
feet of a parked television van while cheering wildly.
   Police escorted firefighters in to extinguish the flames.
   Several protesters got into the hotel and hung a banner from a
window 12 stories above the street, reading ``Viva FSLN.'' FSLN is
an acronym for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua, who lost the
presidential election Sunday in that Central American nation.
   Protesters also hurled about 300 pro-Sandinista leaflets into
the lobby as firecrackers popped outside.
   Five people were arrested, police said.
   Earlier, about 50 anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans chanted
``Violeta'' and ``Uno,'' referring to Nicaragua's president-elect,
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, and her National Opposition Union
party.

   The government is letting Manuel
Antonio Noriega's wife and three children leave the country, but
demanding that four of the ousted dictator's former associates
surrender to authorities.
   Gen. Noriega's wife, Felicidad Sieiro, and daughters Sandra,
Lorena and Thais were among 10 people granted safe conduct abroad
on Wednesday, said Foreign Minister Julio Linares.
   Noriega's wife and daughters had taken refuge at the Cuban
Embassy residence after the Dec. 20 invasion that overthrew
Noriega. All have been granted political asylum by the Dominican
Republic.
   Three former Noriega officers, accused of killing conspirators
in a failed Oct. 3 coup against Noriega, and a former legislator,
also accused of murder, were refused safe conduct out of the
country, Linares said.
   Luis Antonio Suarez, a radio station owner who led a group that
attacked opposition groups, also was given safe conduct.
   Others accused of minor crimes and granted safe conducts were:
Baltazar Renaan Aizpurua, a former leader of the journalists' union
and telephone company spokesman under Noriega; Zelideth Rosales de
Aizpurua, who had a women's group that supported Noriega; Humberto
Lopez Tyrone, a Noriega politician who organized street gangs that
attacked the opposition; Marcela Tason, Noriega's secretary; and
Edgardo Lopez Grimaldo, Noriega's press secretary.
   They had been staying at the embassies of Cuba, Ecuador,
Nicaragua or Peru.
   Linares said Panama would ask for the extradition of any of
those given safe conduct if they are needed to testify at trials.
   Asked to surrender were: Capt. Asuncion Eliecer Gaitan, who was
Noriega's chief bodyguard and took asylum at the Vatican Embassy;
Maj. Gonzalo Gonzalez, chief of the Macho del Monte battalion that
came to Noriega's rescue in the Oct. 3 coup attempt, and Capt.
Heraclides Sucre.
   Gonzalez and Sucre have been in the Peruvian Embassy.
   Luis Gomez, a leader of the paramilitary Dignity Battalions and
a former congressman, also was refused safe conduct because two
charges of assassination have been filed against him, Linares said
without elaboration.
   Noriega was ousted following the U.S. invasion and is being held
in Miami pending trial on U.S. drug trafficking and money
laundering charges.
   He was replaced by Guillermo Endara, recognized as the winner of
elections in May. Noriega nullified that election.

<HEAD>New Zealand Town Takes Hilary Foretich To Heart</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not many 7-year-old girls have
a lawyer, a psychiatrist, and two names.
   Hilary Foretich _ the focus of an international custody battle _
does, and Christchurch has reacted to her plight with the
protectiveness of an oversized country town.
   Hilary, or Ellen Morgan as she is known to schoolmates here, now
is the best-known child in New Zealand as well as Page One news in
the United States.
   When her maternal grandparents ran away to Christchurch to
harbor the child from her father, they chose an apt sanctuary.
   Not only does New Zealand's revamped family law system aim to
act in the best interests of the child at all times, so do the
people of Christchurch, who have taken Hilary to heart.
   Hilary's mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, sent the child off with
her parents after a Washington D.C. judge ruled that the girl's
father could have unsupervised visits with Hilary.
   Dr. Morgan has accused estranged husband Eric Foretich of
sexually abusing the child, a charge Foretich denies. She went to
jail for 25 months rather than reveal the child's whereabouts.
   Foretich, a dentist from Falls Church, Va., spent more than two
years trying to track his daughter and his efforts finally paid off
as private investigators tracked down the girl last month.
   He arrived in Christchurch today but, at the local Family
Court's request, won't see Hilary. He says he wants to see his
daughter, but will abide by the court's temporary injunction.
   Hilary reportedly has not seen either parent for two years. Her
mother was released from jail last fall after Congress passed a law
tailored for her that limited imprisonment for civil contempt in
the District of Columbia to a year.
   Even though Hilary's identity became known to her acquaintances
in late 1989, when a television documentary on her parents' bitter
custody battle was broadcast, the people of Christchurch were happy
to keep the secret.
   It was a secret that had previously been revealed only to
Hilary's doctor and the headmistress of the exclusive private
school she has attended since arriving in New Zealand in July 1988.
   The Morgan family said this week that they never lied about
their identity, they just ``froze people out'' when they asked
about ``Ellen's'' background.
   Foretich would not respond today to the allegations about him,
but said he would try to keep Hilary's privacy and dignity.
   ``I'm not going to get involved in scintillation and
retaliation,'' he told reporters at Christchurch airport before
being ushered into a waiting car and driven away with journalists'
vehicles in pursuit.
   The Family Court, which is to rule on the custody case, has
warned journalists that they could be fined or jailed if they
publish details of the custody case. Even Prime Minister Geoffrey
Palmer has become involved, warning that U.S. reporters covering
the case will have to stick to New Zealand laws.
   New Zealand's contempt of court laws are starkly different from
thos in the United States, barring any discussion of a case before
its conclusion. So far, both sides of the family have taken their
lawyers' advise and kept quiet.
   The citizens of Christchurch, a quiet city with a population of
under 300,000 which lies 190 miles south of Wellington, have shown
their displeasure as the foreign media descended on the city this
week.
   Not much news comes out of Christchurch outside of sheep farming
_ the major industry here. Hotel staff and cab drivers can't recall
the last time journalists took over the town.
   ``Leave the poor, wee girl alone,'' ``Leave her alone, you
mongrels'' are typical remarks, along with obscenities, shouted to
journalists staking out Hilary's school or home.
   Even rock star Elton John exhorted fans at a Christchurch
concert Wednesday night to ``run the foreign media out of town.''
   Hilary's grandmother, Antonia Morgan, said the child was feeling
``haunted'' by the battery of photographers and journalists.
   The Christchurch Star newspaper commented: ``As perhaps never
before in its history, Christchurch is the center of international
media attention. The matter raises anew the recurring question of
how far the media should go in fulfilling their duty to report the
facts to the public.
   ``The media in New Zealand could not ignore a subject of such
major human interest when it suddenly landed on their doorstep.
Inevitably, Hilary is a victim of such attention.
   ``The public have been given enough by now to meet any
reasonable appetite for information. Hilary's story and her
parents' stories, have been told from many angles. Now, for the
child's sake if for no other, the matter should be left for the
courts to decide.''

   Dustin Hoffman's new lead role is real-life
drama: He's helping a terminally ill student who needs a bone
marrow donor.
   The Oscar-winning actor has made a six-figure donation and a
plea for Allison Atlas, who learned in August she had three to six
months to live unless a marrow transplant checked her leukemia.
   ``If we find a donor, we'd literally be taking someone off death
row,'' said Hoffman, winner of Academy Awards for best actor in
last year's ``Rain Man'' and the 1979 ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   Hoffman on Tuesday said something about Miss Atlas, a
20-year-old business major at New York University and a resident of
Bethesda, Md., got him involved.
   ``It's hard to explain. It picked me,'' he said.
   The Atlas family made a public plea in November. Since then,
more than 16,000 people offered to be donors. Because of the
family's efforts, 25 to 50 potential donors were found for other
people in her situation.
   ``It's just a matter of getting the right person to come to one
of our drives,'' said Miss Atlas, one of 9,000 people awaiting a
donor.
   Of Hoffman's support, she said: ``I don't know if it's fate or
what. It's my only hope.''

   President Bush has found a rich vein of joke
material: the divorce battle between Donald and Ivana Trump.
   On a fund-raiser for a Republican candidate in a Staten Island
congressional election, Bush said his visit to New York had put him
in the midst of ``one of the greatest contests of 1990,'' a battle
with ``a lot at stake, a lot of money spent on both sides, a lot of
press attention.''
   Pause.
   ``But I'm not here to talk about the Trumps.''
   The president, who received a good deal of positive press when
the first dog, Millie, had a White House litter, also offered
advice to congressional candidate Susan Molinari:
   ``Puppies: worth 10 points easy.''

   George C. Wallace isn't bothered about
being called ``the late governor'' by NBC commentator John
Chancellor, a spokesman says.
   ``Newsmen have been making mistakes about George Wallace all of
his life,'' Elvin Stanton said. ``It's something he brushes off.''
   During Chancellor's commentary Tuesday night, he quoted Wallace
as once saying governors were nothing more than ``ornaments.''
Chancellor then said, ``Well, it's too bad the late governor wasn't
here in Washington this week'' for a governors conference.
   NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay said the mistake was corrected
during the 6 p.m. CST feed of the national news.
   Stanton said he did not call NBC because he knew enough people
were aware Wallace was still alive. Wallace, who lives in
Montgomery, has kept a low profile since leaving office in 1987
after four four-year terms.

   Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson has been
charged with sexually assaulting a female writer who was attempting
to interview him.
   Thompson, 52, surrendered to the district attorney's office
Monday and was freed on $2,600 bail.
   He is charged with sexual assault for allegedly grabbing the
woman's breast and simple assault for allegedly punching her during
an argument about whether the interview should take place in a hot
tub.
   Thompson, whose ``gonzo'' journalism is laced with drug
references and wild hyperbole, said he is innocent and believes the
woman wants publicity for her new venture, which he said is selling
sexual aids and lingerie.
   Officers from the district attorney's office said they searched
Thompson's house on Monday and found a small quantity of suspected
cocaine and marijuana.
   The woman pressing the charges was identified as a 35-year-old
self-employed woman from St. Clair, Mich., who said she attempted
to interview Thompson on Feb. 21.
   Thompson is the author of several books, including ``Fear and
Loathing On the Campaign Trail.''

   The Walt Disney Co. threatened legal action
against the source of a bogus news release that claimed Michael
Jackson had signed a five-year movie deal with Disney.
   Disney said it began an investigation to find the author of the
release, used as the basis for a story in the Hollywood Reporter.
Among other things, the story said Jackson was negotiating to leave
CBS Records for Disney's new Hollywood Records and would design
theme park rides for Disney.
   ``We fully intend to take action against the person or persons
responsible,'' Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg
said. ``This company has a reputation for protecting its name and
taking legal action when necessary.''
   The paper ran a front-page article Wednesday saying it had been
the victim of a hoax.
   Jackson stars at Disneyland in the 3-D movie ``Captain EO,''
which opened in 1986.

   Paul Newman is heading back to court
for another trial to decide whether a delicatessen owner deserves
of cut of the profits from Newman's Own salad dressing.
   Julius Gold claims he was promised 8 percent of the profits for
helping develop and market the dressing. But Newman, who lives in
Westport, contends he developed the dressing in his home and
decided the profits should go to charity.
   The first trial, in 1988, ended in a mistrial because jurors
inadvertently were given material ruled inadmissible. Newman
testified at the trial, at one point pounding a bottle of his
dressing on the stand.
   Jury selection begins March 7 in the second trial.

   A strong earthquake rocked a 200-mile
swath of Southern California on Wednesday, triggering rock slides
onto highways, causing scattered structural damage and frightening
thousands.
   Two people suffered broken legs and a woman went into early
labor, said City Councilman Tom McGilloway, Upland's acting mayor.
   The quake had a magnitude of 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   The temblor, felt from San Diego to Santa Barbara and swayed
high-rise buildings in Las Vegas, 230 miles to the east, sent 70
people fleeing a collapsing warehouse wall and forced evacuation of
patients from a hospital.
   It was the most severe temblor in California since the October
1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area that killed 67 people
and awakened fears of the massive quake scientist predict in the
state in coming years.
   In terms of ground shaking, it was about 40 times less severe
than the World Series quake, which measured 7.1, said Lucile Jones
of the U.S. Geological Service.
   Aftershocks of varying magnitude occurred hours after the
earthquake. The strongest, a 4.8 shaker that rattled the Upland
City Hall where the City Council was meeting to discuss measures to
take in the aftermath of the quake, struck at 7:24 p.m.
   The quake, centered three miles northwest of Upland and about 40
miles east of Los Angeles, struck at 3:43 p.m., and was measured at
5.5 on the Richter scale on instruments at the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena.
   The U.S. Geological Survey gave the same magnitude, but a
preliminary reading by University of California Seismographic
Stations at Berkeley put the magnitude at 6.0. Such measuring
differences are common. A quake of magnitude 5.5 is capable of
causing considerable damage.
   Scattered damage was reported in the region east of Los Angeles.
   In La Verne, a few miles from the epicenter, 70 workers fled as
a wall collapsed at a warehouse. Workers leaped out windows and
dove off a loading dock, but no one was seriously hurt, even though
two workers were pulling stock along the 20-foot by 80-foot wall at
the time.
   ``Everything happened so fast trying to get 70 people out of the
warehouse it's amazing nobody got seriously hurt,'' said supervisor
Stan Sokolowski.
   Pomona Valley Hospital evacuated 60 patients due to broken water
lines, said Nancy Hardaker, spokeswoman for the state Office of
Emergency Services. The hospital could not be reached by phone.
   At Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, about five miles from the
epicenter, the quake broke a window and toppled wall-mounted
bookcases in the president's office, said Burt Tashman, at the
school.
   ``I'm on the second story and boy, I tell you, things started
shaking,'' Tashman said. ``Glass fell from the wall of the
president's office and fell all over the place. Pictures fell. The
pane broke. That sort of thing.''
   Windows shattered at City Halls in Upland and nearby Pomona.
   At Ontario International Airport, a few miles from the
epicenter, ceiling panels and signs fell, and windows cracked in
the operations tower, said manager Michael DiGirolamo.
   A small rock slide on Interstate 10 in Pomona, not far from the
epicenter, startled motorists, causing minor accidents, the Highway
Patrol said. Another small rockslide closed the road through
Soledad Canyon, 35 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   A boulder twice the size of a car fell onto Angeles Crest
Highway in the San Gabriel Mountains, blocking half of the two-lane
rural road.
   The San Francisco area quake struck Oct. 17, as the third game
of the World Series was about to begin. In addition to the 67
deaths, the quake injured about 3,000 people and did $7 billion in
damage.
   The worst recent Southern California quake struck the Whittier
area Oct. 1, 1987. It measured 5.9 on the Richter scale and,
together with a 5.3-magnitude aftershock Oct. 4, killed eight
people, injured more than 200 and caused $358 million in damage.
   Wednesday's quake, felt as a rolling motion in Los Angeles, came
three hours after a smaller quake in the same area.
   The main shock was followed by 16 aftershocks of magnitude 2.3
or greater within 2{ hours, Caltech said.
   Several hours after the main quake, the state Office of
Emergency Services issued a carefully worded advisory saying that a
quake as large as, or somewhat larger could occur in the area.
   The agency, pointedly noting that no specific prediction had
been made, said authorities in San Bernardino, Riverside, Los
Angeles and Orange counties had been advised to remain prepared.
   U.S. Geological Survey scientist Lucile Jones said that based on
historical records of past California earthquakes there was a 5
percent chance the main shock would be followed by a larger quake
within three days. However, the odds drop off rapidly so that by
Thursday morning the likelihood of such a quake probably would be
at most 2 or 3 percent, she said.
   Southern California Edison said 6,000 electrical customers lost
power but only 1,300 remained without service 90 minutes after the
main shock.
   Southern California Edison Co., operators of the San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station just south of San Clemente, reported an
``unusual event'' to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Both reactors at the plant continued to run and power supply was
uninterrupted, said Edison spokesman Bob Goodlow. An ``unusual
event'' is the lowest of four emergency designations for nuclear
plants.
   Phone service to thousands of customers was disrupted, but Cati
Flynn of Pacific Bell said it was likely caused by callers jamming
lines.
   ``It felt like somebody picked up the building and dropped it a
couple of times,'' said police Lt. Don Manning at the station in
nearby Ontario, where false ceilings fell. ``It was like we went up
a foot, then down a foot, then up again.''
   Broken windows and minor structural damage were reported in
Ontario, Manning said, the worst to an old three-story brick
theater and office building.
   ``We had a dandy earthquake. It was a bumpy, jerky kind of
earthquake,'' said Holly Jones of Hacienda Heights, a Los Angeles
suburb. ``My china cabinet and several glasses fell out and broke.''
   It was felt as far north as Santa Barbara, nearly 100 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, and as far south as San Diego, 150 miles
to the south. It was also felt in Palm Springs, 100 miles to the
east.
   People reported feeling the quake in Barstow in the Mojave
Desert and Bakersfield at the south end of the San Joaquin Valley.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   The earthquake that rumbled across
Southern California on Wednesday was another reminder that the
state straddles two gigntic plates of Earth's constantly moving
crust.
   ``California sits on the boundary between the Pacific and North
American plates, which are moving with respect to each other at
about two inches per year,'' said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at
the California Institute of Technology.
   ``That motion causes strain or deformation to happen in the
crust. When something snaps under that strain, it's an
earthquake,'' she said.
   Wednesday's earthquake, considered moderate with a magnitude of
5.5 on the Richter scale, was felt from San Diego to Santa Barbara.
Two people suffered broken legs and a woman went into early labor
in Upland, near the epicenter, and there was scattered structural
damage.
   Sixteen aftershocks strong enough to be felt occurred within 2{
hours of the 3:43 p.m. main shock and a 4.8 aftershock struck at
7:24 p.m. The state Office of Emergency Services issued an advisory
saying equally strong or more powerful aftershocks could occur over
the next three days.
   The Pacific plate underlies the Pacific Ocean and much of
Southern California. It is slowly grinding northwest past the North
American plate, which underlies the rest of the continent.
   The 600-mile San Andreas Fault generally is considered the
boundary between the two plates, but the plate motion also triggers
earthquakes on a complicated series of faults that riddle
California.
   The movement of the Pacific plate creates many parallel faults
that run northwest to southeast and include the San Andreas, the
San Jacinto and a series of offshore faults.
   But others, including the unnamed fault that caused Wednesday's
quake, run perpendicular to the plate motion, or from northeast to
southwest. Those faults also are created by the plate movements.
   Both types of faults are known as strike-slip faults in which
ground on one side of a fault moves horizontally past ground on the
other side.
   California's seismic map is even more complex. As it slides past
the North American plate, the Pacific plate also presses against it.
   That compression can cause thrust faults, where ground on one
side of a fault moves vertically with respect to ground on the
other side.
   Thrust fault motion has caused several destructive earthquakes
in California in recent years, including the 1987 Whittier Narrows
quake east of Los Angeles, the 1983 Coalinga earthquake in the San
Joaquin Valley, and the 1971 San Fernando earthquake that killed at
least 58 people in the Los Angeles area.
   A strike-slip jolt, Wednesday's earthquake occurred three miles
northwest of Upland at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, which
themselves were created by compressive thrust motion. It was
centered at least 15 miles from any of the region's major faults,
said Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey.
   Until the Whittier quake, which with a major aftershock killed
eight people, scientists thought the major seismic threat in
California was posed by strike-slip quakes. But Whittier made them
realize that hidden thrust faults may pose an equal or more serious
threat, regardless of the type of earthquake.
   Wednesday's jolt ``is a reminder of the seismically active area
we live in,'' said Paul Flores of the California Office of
Emergency Services.
   ``The shaking most people felt was minor as opposed to what we
know can happen. Therefore people need to take the necessary
precautions to prepare in reducing hazards at home and in the
workplace.''

   Tchaikovksy's ``The Maid of Orleans'' was
presented at Carnegie Hall by the Opera Orchestra of New York,
founded 20 years ago by Eve Queler to perform concert versions of
rarely heard operas.
   The performance Wednesday, the title role brilliantly sung by
mezzo-soprano Delora Zajick, followed one last Saturday by the same
orchestra at Brooklyn College. That one, with a different cast, was
called the New York premiere of the opera and the U.S. premiere of
the opera in Russian.
   ``The Maid of Orleans'' has some glorious music, especially in
the first two of the four acts. The libretto reads as though there
isn't much action, so a concert version may be the best way to hear
it.
   And, in this opera, Joan of Arc isn't burned at the stake
because of an accusation of witchcraft but because she falls in
love with _ and doesn't kill _ the last English officer left alive.
Other Englishmen kill him, as a traitor, and capture her.
   Joan is a wonderful role for mezzo-soprano and Miss Zajick made
the most of it. She has a big voice, which can pour forth a solid
column of sound, and she can sing with sweet softness. At any
volume, she has a purity of sound appropriate for Joan.
   Near the end of Act 1 she has an aria saying goodby to the
fields of home. In the incredibly melodic ending to Act 2, she has
another wonderful aria, recounting her visions.
   The other two outstanding voices in the cast were soprano Marvis
Martin in a rather small role as the French king's mistress and
Finnish baritone Jorma Hynninen as the English officer. We also
liked tenor Fan Jing-ma, who began his musical studies in China,
singing Joan's early suitor and bass Sergei Koptchak of
Czechoslovakia who sang her father.
   Miss Queler obviously knew what she wanted from the music and
her orchestra responded glowingly to her conducting. The New York
Choral Society directed by John Daly Goodwin was the excellent
large chorus on stage. A band of minstrels also is called for and
the Yale Russian Chorus, led by David-Marc Finley, took that role,
arriving down an aisle and crossing in front of the stage, singing
with harmonious blend as they went.
   Heavenly voices and trumpets were heard several times during the
evening from the top balcony.

   Western journalists pledged fellowships and advice
on circulation and advertising to help their East bloc colleagues
develop an independent press.
   At a conference Wednesday, a U.N. agency also backed a Polish
proposal to establish an center in Warsaw dedicated to training a
new generation of journalists in independent reporting and helping
to nurture a free press.
   Hard-line Communist rulers in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East
Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania had manipulated reporting for
decades, but with the popular upheaval that toppled them last year
came a demand for independent journalism.
   In several East bloc countries, fledgling independent newspapers
are competing with well-funded organs still under Communist control.
   At a two-day UNESCO meeting, Eastern European journalists sought
everything from typewriters to printing presses from Western
colleagues.
   The editor of the Swiss magazine Hebdo, Jacques Pilet, put the
Western reponse succinctly when he said, ``Don't expect a sudden
shower of dollars or trucks rolling in with bales of newsprint.''
   But he said there is a real desire to help ``with training and
advice.''
   The Poynter Institute of St. Petersburg, Fla., a private
foundation, offered eight fully funded fellowships to journalists
from the East bloc.
   Representatives from USA Today, the Times of London and the
British newspaper The Guardian said they would look into getting
information to Eastern European news people on the training of
personnel in advertising and circulation as well as in journalism.
   The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is
``going to try to establish a network'' of contacts, exchanges and
information on training and media operations, said its information
director, Alain Modoux.
   He also said UNESCO decided to provide $20,000 to establish the
Central European Center for Communication in Warsaw. The
International Federation of Journalists said it would contribute
another $10,000 to start the school.
   Other East bloc journalists also supported the school, said
Katarzyna Kolodziejczy of the Polish Journalists Association.
   At a news conference following Wednesday's end to the meeting,
Modoux did not say what action, if any, UNESCO would take in
response to the apparent decision by Soviet authorities to bar
independent journalist Sergei Grigoryants from traveling to Paris
to attend the conference.
   Grigoryants sent UNESCO a telegram in which he said that
although he had a French visa his passport was confiscated an hour
before his departure. He blamed the KGB for the move.
   ``This incident, which is usual in the USSR, once again
emphasizes the real value of numerous (Soviet) statements about
widening contacts with the West,'' his message said. He said it
also emphasized the difference between the official and independent
press in the Soviet Union.
   Leaders from official Soviet publications such as Ogonyok
magazine editor-in-chief Vitaly Korotich and Vladislav A. Starkov,
editor of the weekly newspaper Arguments and Facts, participated in
the conference.

<TEXT>
   Weeks before the start of Imelda Marcos'
racketeering trial, a banker accused of helping the former
Philippine first lady transfer stolen funds has struck a plea
bargain and agreed to help prosecutors.
   Rodolfo T. Arambulo pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to
the lesser charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud.
   Arambulo, 57, is the former president of the California Overseas
Bank, a Los Angeles-based bank indicted with Arambulo, Mrs. Marcos,
the late Ferdinand Marcos and Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi in
the racketeering case in 1988.
   Mrs. Marcos' trial with her co-defendants begins March 20.
   Arambulo, a fugitive until his surrender Monday to FBI agents in
New York, admitted to a scheme to fraudulently obtain insurance
from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for the bank, which
prosecutors say was secretly owned by Marcos.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella would not say whether
Arambulo would be called as a witness at Mrs. Marcos' trial, but
his cooperation agreement said he would be required to testify at
proceedings related to the case.
   The conspiracy charge against Arambulo carries up to five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine. The indictment had charged him with
racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, which carry up to 20
years in prison each.
   The indictment accuses the Marcoses of siphoning more than $100
million from the Philippine treasury to buy New York City real
estate and art. They also were charged with embezzling $165 million
from several banks.
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   Arambulo's plea came after U.S. District Judge John Keenan
refused to dismiss the indictment against Mrs. Marcos on a claim
that she and her husband were abducted from their homeland by U.S.
officials during his overthrow in 1986.
   The judge noted that the Marcoses were accompanied to Hawaii by
an entourage of 122.
   ``This was more akin to a troop movement than a kidnapping,'' he
said.
   Mrs. Marcos had claimed that at no time did she agree to leave
the country.
   In rejecting the kidnapping claim, Keenan quoted a statement by
Marcos two days after their arrival in Hawaii in which the ousted
dictator said he was there ``under the hospitality'' of the U.S.
government.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bench warfare has broken out in the city's
subways, as the Transit Authority yanks seats from stations to
force the slumbering homeless to find other accommodations.
   Not all stations _ just in those where officials say the
homeless congregate, using benches as places to sleep and worse.
   ``These benches are not used by the general public,'' said
Transit Authority spokesman Bob Slovak. ``These are benches that
have been taken over by the homeless, benches that have been
defecated on, urinated on.''
   The effort started last week, when 10 benches were removed from
three stations. The program drew immediate condemnations from an
unusual coalition of homeless advocates and commuter groups.
   ``Moe, Larry and Curly really are running the MTA,'' said Keith
Summa, advocacy director of the Coalition for the Homeless.
   ``What the Transit Authority has to do is acknowledge that
homeless folks aren't going to go away unless they are helped with
housing and increased rehabilitation facilities,'' said Joseph
Rappaport, coordinator of the Straphangers Campaign, a commuter
group.
   The program was conceived by a task force formed to shore up
Operation Enforcement, a program to improve subway ambience.
   When Operation Enforcement began in October, the Transit
Authority and its parent, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, said they intended to enforce strictly a ban on
littering, panhandling and loitering.
   The program has lagged from the start. Police say for the record
that they support Operation Enforcement, but privately they admit
that in a transit system plagued by a record number of felonies
last year, they have no energy or time to go after beggars or
loiterers.
   Transit Authority officials insist that they are not persecuting
the homeless; they point to programs they have launched to persuade
homeless people in the subways _ a population estimated at 2,500 by
the authority and at 4,000 to 5,000 by homeless advocates _ to find
shelter elsewhere.
   Gilbert Morales, who lived in the subways for seven years,
scoffs at any suggestion that authorities have the best interests
of the homeless at heart.
   ``They just want to get the homeless out on the street,'' said
Morales, who now has a home and a job as a messenger. ``If the city
shelters were safer, people would get out of the train stations.''
   Commuters, he said, never used the benches anyway. Many other
homeless people said they didn't use the benches either _ that the
tunnels and crannies of the subway system are more likely homes to
the homeless.
   Mike, who has spent the past year in the subways, sat on a
plastic milk crate in Grand Central Terminal, near the subway
entrance. Mike, along with police and others, disputed assertions
that the homeless left bodily waste on the benches.
   The best places to sleep are the tunnels, he said, despite
warnings that the tunnels are dangerous.
   ``It's heated, brother, believe me. But you have to know where
they are,'' Mike said.
   As for the removal of the benches, ``It ain't going to prove
nothing, they're just going to sleep on the floor,'' Mike said.
``They ain't doing anything but hurting the commuters.''
   Some commuters were eager to give up the seats. ``Take them
out,'' said one woman who would not give her name. ``They're
disgusting.''
   But Sharon Gary, who lives near a station where benches have
been removed, said the removal of the benches was horrible; the
homeless, she said, caused no safety problem. Besides, she said,
she had ``a real heavy backpack and I need some place to put it.''
   ``They don't seem to have a policy. It's piecemeal,'' said
Sidney Feldman, a communications consultant, as he passed through
Grand Central. ``The basic problem is they don't have any place for
the homeless to go where they feel safe. They just move them
around.''
   That, say homeless advocates like Summa, is the problem.
   Summa said that similar efforts to dislocate the homeless were
unsuccessful in Grand Central, also run by the MTA, where benches
were removed or closed off and ammonia poured into telephone booths
to keep loiterers from settling in.
   ``Homeless people are still there,'' Summa said. ``The TA has to
relearn everything that was learned at Grand Central.''
   He said the only way to get rid of homeless people ``is to
provide additional services, a decent place for them to go.''

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf pvs, `The sweeps ...' to RESTORE dropped `of.'</NOTE>

   These are the prime times that try CBS' soul.
Preliminary ratings from the just-ended February ``sweeps'' period
show the network still in last place, facing its third consecutive
season as No. 3.
   But as expected, first-place NBC scored its eighth straight
victory in the sweeps, averaging a 15.1 rating, handily beating the
13.0 average of ABC. CBS averaged a 12.6. Each rating point
represents 921,000 homes.
   The sweeps period that ended Wednesday is one of four periods of
audience measurement in 211 cities by the A.C. Nielsen Co. The
results are important to local stations, which use them to help set
advertising rates.
   On Wednesday, Alan Wurtzel, ABC senior vice president for
research, said the Nielsen returns he provided lacked the last two
days of the February sweeps period, but ``I don't see any major
changes'' in the outcome.
   He spoke at a news conference. Smiliar sessions to discuss the
sweeps race are being held here today by NBC and ABC executives.
   Speaking of the ratings slide of the once-dominant ``CBS Evening
News'' and the rise of ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' Wurtzel
predicted that the latter's string of victories will continue.
   ABC's broadcast, anchored by Peter Jennings, has won the ratings
race for seven consecutive weeks and been victorious in 19 of the
last 20 weeks, according to ABC.
   ``The CBS Evening News'' with Dan Rather has been in third place
for five of the last eight weeks, and tied once this year with Tom
Brokaw's ``NBC Evening News'' for second place, CBS estimates show.
   ``In essence, what we see is that CBS and NBC will be fighting
it out for second place position for some time to come,'' Wurtzel
said.
   On another matter, he said it's simplistic to think that the
Andy Rooney controversy and Rooney's suspension from CBS' ``60
Minutes'' caused that top-rated show's drop in the ratings for the
past three weeks.
   Wurtzel said he had no research that would show if the dispute
caused the decline, but ``it's very simplistic and one-dimensional
to think that any one event triggers things like that. I think it's
a much more complicated thing.''
   On Feb. 8, CBS News suspended Rooney for three months without
pay after a gay magazine attributed racial remarks to him. The
humorist denied making any such statements.
   In ratings for the week before his suspension, ``60 Minutes''
was fifth. Then it slipped to 10th place, then 11th. Last week, it
was No. 18, beaten in its time period Sunday by a rerun of the
premiere of ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   However, Michael Eisenberg, a CBS research vice president, said
that ABC's Sunday show drew viewers because ``America's Funniest
Home Videos,'' now a high-rated series, is ``a pretty hot show and
would do well wherever you put it.''
   He noted that ``60 Minutes'' still is sixth in ratings averages
for the season to date, averaging a 20 rating and 33 per cent share
of audience.
   Wurtzel ducked a question on whether he thought CBS' show is
going to continue to decline in the ratings.
   Noting that ``60 Minutes'' has been on the air since 1968, he
said it's ``still a strong show. But I don't think I'm surprised to
see that there's been a certain amount of slippage.''
   He cited as factors the cyclical nature of television and
competition against CBS' newsmagazine series from ``an enormous
proliferation of similar types of programs'' in recent months.

<HEAD>Senate Democrats, GOP Protect Constituencies in Peace Dividend
Fight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats are the winners in the year's
first congressional face-off over the ``peace dividend,'' as both
parties signal they want to use the money to help their own core
supporters.
   The chamber's majority Democrats won a pair of votes Wednesday
on a topic expected to dominate this year's budget battle: what to
do with funds siphoned from the Pentagon as the Cold War thaws.
   The so-called peace dividend would be used to whittle down the
federal deficit, according to a Democratic measure the chamber
adopted 79-19. That would make cuts in social programs _ which
Democrats traditionally protect _ less likely as Congress seeks
ways to reduce the federal deficit.
   Senators rejected 50-48 a Republican alternative that called for
the money to be used for tax cuts. The GOP plan called for lowering
the capital gains tax rate and extending corporate tax breaks for
research, leading Democrats to label the proposal an effort to help
the wealthy.
   Both measures were non-binding resolutions, meaning the votes
were symbolic. But the afternoon's maneuverings highlighted the
themes the two parties are likely to employ throughout the year.
   ``It's going to be up to Congress to carve out a peace
dividend,'' said Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., a sponsor of the
Democratic measure and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   That was Sasser's way of chiding President Bush for proposing a
Pentagon budget of $292.1 billion for fiscal 1991, which starts
Oct. 1. That figure is $5.3 billion higher than this year's total,
but $3.9 billion less than would be needed to stay even with
inflation.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, sponsor of the GOP proposal, argued
that the Democratic plan simply would allow the government to spend
the money.
   That would be ``a throwback to the failed policies of the
past,'' Gramm said.
   Underpinning Wednesday's debate was the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law, which Gramm helped write and which sets a $64
billion target for next year's budget shortfall. That means
Congress and the White House will have to find about $37 billion in
savings or face automatic spending cuts in most programs.
   If defense spending is cut and the money is used to reduce the
deficit _ as Democrats want _ there would be less pressure to slash
domestic programs.
   But if defense savings are distributed to taxpayers _ as the
Republicans proposed _ there would be nowhere else to turn for
savings but domestic programs.
   The rejected GOP proposal called for the savings to be
``returned to America's taxpayers'' in the form of lower tax rates,
a refundable child care tax credit, a larger tax break for
corporate research and development and other breaks.
   ``Who can we trust to invest in America's future, the federal
government or the families of America?'' Gramm asked.
   But Democrats accused the GOP of favoring tax advantages for the
rich. The Democratic plan said that besides deficit reduction, some
savings should be spent on national problems such as education and
drugs, and for tax breaks ``for working men and women.''
   ``We need to take this peace dividend and we need to apply these
funds wisely,'' Sasser said.
   The term ``peace dividend'' can be misleading. With the
government running persistent deficits, reductions in the
Pentagon's budget will not leave the government with surplus
dollars to spend.
   The Congressional Budget Office projects next year's deficit
will be $138 billion. Most Democrats and some Republicans want
defense cut below Bush's proposal, but few of them want those
reductions to exceed a few billion dollars next year.
   The savings will grow in coming years, however, as high-price
weapons systems and other projects that take several years to build
fall by the wayside.
   In the face of certain approval of the Democratic proposal, 25
Republicans joined 54 Democrats voting for passage. Seven
Republicans then joined 43 Democrats in rejecting the GOP measure.

<HEAD>Sandinistas to the Pollsters, Oppositionists at the Polls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. pollsters who anticipated an election
triumph for Daniel Ortega say they failed to take account of the
distrust ordinary Nicaraguans might have for strangers with
clipboards asking questions.
   Nor did U.S. policy-makers anticipate that the polls would turn
out to be so skewed. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in the
days before Sunday's elections, allowed himself to be drawn into
speculation about U.S. policy toward a post-election Ortega
government.
   ``We shouldn't assume this,'' Baker said in an appearance before
a congressional hearing, but he went on to lay out _ on the
assumption that Ortega would win _ tough terms the Sandinistas
would have to meet before normal relations could be restored.
   The expectation that Ortega would overwhelm his opponent,
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, colored television coverage too.
   Said NBC's Ed Rabel from Managua on Feb. 21 over a picture of
Ortega: ``This is the man, pollsters say, who will be elected
overwhelmingly this weekend. ... The election observers say the
Bush administration may have itself to blame for Daniel Ortega's
rise in popularity among the votes. The reason, they say, is the
U.S. military invasion in Panama. ... It was a close race until the
U.S. invaded.''
   ``Almost certainly,'' said Ted Koppel of ABC two nights later,
``the Sandinistas will still win.''
   Post-election analysis showed that polls conducted by
organizations from Venezuela, Argentina and Costa Rica correctly
saw Mrs. Chamorro as the leader.
   In fact, The Washington Post noted, of 27 polls released in the
last months of 1989 and this year, 14 showed the Sandinistas ahead
and 13 gave the lead to Mrs. Chamorro's coalition.
   But the big American polls pointed to an Ortega landslide.
   The Washington Post-ABC News poll had Ortega leading by 48
percent to 32 percent with the rest scattered, undecided or
unwilling to declare themselves. A poll conducted for the
Spanish-language television network Univision had Ortega ahead
53-35. A poll conducted for Hemisphere Initiative, an observer
group, by Greenberg-Lakes Associates put the Sandinistas in the
lead, 44-27, in December and 51-34 in late January.
   When Nicaraguans voted Sunday, they turned those polls on their
heads. Mrs. Chamorro won overwhelmingly, 55 percent to 41 percent.
   ``Many of the people we interviewed in Nicaragua were simply
unwilling to allow themselves to be identified as an enemy of the
Sandinista government,'' says Rob Schroth of Bendixen &amp; Schroth,
which took the Univision poll.
   ``In Nicaragua, the government plays a very major role in the
everyday lives of the average citizen and people simply weren't
going to take any chances that interviewers might be agents for the
government,'' Schroth said.
   Then, too, the government prohibited the release of polls in the
30 days before the election, when anti-Sandinista sentiment may
have been coalescing behind Mrs. Chamorro.
   Mark Penn, who has worked extensively in Latin America but did
not poll in Nicaragua, said the situation was too unstable for
accurate polling.
   ``Polling is helpful in a stable democracy but in a place where
there is no history of democracy it is unreliable,'' he said. ``You
are going to have to say there are limits to polling.''
   Some analysts say the election was cast in pro- or
anti-Sandinista terms with insufficient attention paid to economic
discontent.
   ``No government associated with hyper-inflation is going to win
an election,'' said Laurence Birns, executive director of the
Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a liberal research group critical
of U.S. policy toward Nicaragua. For all that, Birns miscalculated;
he predicted a narrow Sandinista win.
   Pollster Stanley Greenberg of Greenberg-Lake Associates says
Ortega may have lost the election in the last few weeks.
   ``He conducted a glitzy American-style campaign and it
backfired,'' said Greenberg.
   Ortega put himself in a losing proposition, Greenberg said, by
asking voters to choose between his own austere personality and
Mrs. Chamorro's warmth.
   ``Our surveys showed a large bloc trying to preserve what the
Sandinistas had brought and worrying that the opposition would turn
the clock back, but once the Sandinista campaign centered on the
cult of personality, once the advertising was rock music and the
youth culture, I wonder if the campaign didn't trivialize the
issues,'' Greenberg said.

   The Bush administration is starting from
scratch in devising a U.S. aid plan for Nicaragua because it did
not expect opposition presidential candidate Violeta Chamorro to
win, a senior official says.
   ``Nobody has a clue'' how much money is needed to get Mrs.
Chamorro's new government started and help her impoverished
country's economy begin to recover from a decade of war and
misguided economic policies, said an administration official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``You've really got a basket case,'' the official said
Wednesday. ``It's going to take a top-to-bottom look at what the
government needs to get back on its feet.''
   The Bush administration will begin by waiving trade sanctions
imposed on Nicaragua in 1985 and perhaps other inexpensive and
largely symbolic actions designed to indicate support for Mrs.
Chamorro, the official said.
   Members of Congress have suggested the United States begin by
pouring $200 million to $300 million into Nicaragua this year, but
the administration will be unable to come up with its own
recommendation before Mrs. Chamorro is sworn in as president April
25, the official said.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III, declared
Wednesday in testimony on Capitol Hill that ``the war is over'' in
Nicaragua despite lingering mistrust by longtime foes.
   President Bush held what he called a constructive telephone
conversation with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on a range
of issues that included Nicaragua. Bush said later in a speech that
``from Moscow to Managua, change is in the air.''
   ``The world has undergone another upheaval, but this time there
is no war and there are fewer tyrants in the world than before,''
Bush said at a San Francisco fund-raiser for Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., who is running for governor.
   The president called Gorbachev _ whom the administration credits
with playing an important role in encouraging free elections in
Nicaragua _ a bold leader who was undertaking daring reforms.
   In Managua, officials began to address the problems of the
country's first peaceful transfer of power to a democratically
elected government, including how to demobilize the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels who have been fighting the leftist government since
1981.
   President Daniel Ortega said in a Wednesday interview on the
MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour that the Nicaraguan elections occurred
under a threat from the United States.
   ``The U.S. was virtually saying to the Nicaraguan people `If you
don't vote for UNO (the opposition), then the war and the economic
sanctions are going to continue.'''
   In contrast, he said, the Soviet Union has been ``respectful of
the sovereign decision of the Nicaraguan people.''
   Ortega said the Sandinistas ``will support everything in the UNO
government that is geared toward the national interests, toward the
people's interests.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who led a large election observer
group and mediated between the two sides after the voting, met with
Baker on Wednesday and called on the rebels to lay down their arms.
   Carter said what happens to the Contras was ``the key unresolved
factor'' in Nicaragua.
   ``If you have an army on the edge of your country or in your
country that still threatens military action, that's obviously a
very destabilizing factor,'' Carter told reporters. ``I don't think
there is going to be a guarantee of an orderly transition as long
as the Contras are a military force threatening the country.''
   Baker, in his testimony Wednesday, noted that a bipartisan
policy agreement between the administration and Congress last year
called for ``voluntary reintegration'' of the rebels under safe and
democratic conditions.
   With Sunday's election victory by Mrs. Chamorro and a request by
her and Ortega for the rebels to disband, Baker said, ``those
conditions are now rapidly being created.''
   However, he added that years of distrust had produced
``legitimate fears on both sides that should be addressed.''
   Baker said he hoped Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo in Managua ``would be able to play a role in resolving this
issue,'' along with the United Nations and the Organization of
American States.
   Carter also seemed optimistic. Having spoken with most of the
Sandinista leaders, including Defense Minister Humberto Ortega,
Carter said the Chamorro-led National Opposition Union and the
Sandinistas were working harmoniously on a transition of power.
   Carter said the Sandinistas acknowledged the results of the
election, as well as Mrs. Chamorro's right to choose her own
ministers of defense and interior, which control the army and
security forces.
   Still, he said the Contras, who fought with American weapons and
money to bring down the Sandinistas, had ``legitimate concerns that
must be met.''

<HEAD>Proposed Panama Aid Program Too Large, Panel Chairman Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's request for an
emergency $500 million to restart Panama's stalled economy is
catching trouble from several directions on Capitol Hill even
before it comes up for formal consideration.
   Bush requested the aid in a Feb. 6 letter to House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., proposig to pay for the assistance by
borrowing from several Pentagon accounts.
   But the proposal ran into problems with members of Congress
whose pet defense programs and projects would be affected by the
money transfer, and that sent the bill back to the drawing board.
   ``There were massive problems, up and down the list,'' said one
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. But
the official said the attempted cuts of congressional projects had
been ``no accident.''
   On Wednesday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
Appropriations subcommittee which deals with foreign aid, vowed
that he would cut the aid sharply because it was too much to give
to Panama.
   ``I guarantee you that's not going to happen,'' Leahy said,
referring to the aid package. ``There will be no half a billion
dollars in that supplemental'' for Panama.
   ``I wouldn't support that, and I'm not sure many others will,''
he said in an interview. ``Nobody ever asked anybody up here (on
Capitol Hill), do you think it's a good idea? I think somebody just
had a speech to make.''
   He added: ``I'm getting very, very concerned that our foreign
policy, especially in the foreign aid area, is being conducted more
on symbolism than on what should be the goals of the United
States.''
   Leahy said lawmakers would prefer to give some of the money, if
it is available, to emerging new democracies in Eastern Europe. And
he would like to see more go to meet humanitarian needs in Africa,
Leahy said.
   He said he told Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger
the administration should put the brakes on making aid promises to
new democratic governments, including the newly elected opposition
coalition in Nicaragua.
   As far as Panama is concerned, Congress will expect to see
progress made toward reforming the country's tight bank secrecy
laws that have provided cover for drug money laundering, and toward
a new and more benign role for the Panama Defense Forces, Leahy
said.
   The supplemental appropriation measure for Panama likely will be
an attractive target for lawmakers looking for a must-pass vehicle
for other pet proposals.
   Leahy and Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., want to add $400 million
in credits for Israel to build housing for an influx of Soviet
emigres. And Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., announced plans Wednesday
to add $125 million to encourage farmers in Peru, Bolivia and
Colombia to grow something besides the coca leaf used to make
cocaine.
   Despite the problems, the Bush administration believes it
eventually will win passage of some money to help Panama pay
past-due debts and restart its stalled economy. ``We'll get less
than we wanted, but more than (Leahy) wants to give us,'' the
administration official said.

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors are pressing their investigation
of Mayor Marion Barry by issuing a new series of subpoenas for city
records, as Barry prepares for a June trial on charges of cocaine
possession and perjury.
   Barry pleaded innocent Wednesday to five misdemeanor cocaine
charges and three felony perjury counts at a federal court
arraignment. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
scheduled a June 4 trial.
   ``We will not plea bargain, and the mayor is not considering
resigning,'' Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said after the
nine-minute court proceeding. ``The mayor is confident he will be
vindicated at trial.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens would not comment on the
possibility of a plea bargain, but said the probe was continuing
``with respect to a variety of allegations'' involving Barry and
various city services.
   Meanwhile, a top city government source said prosecutors have
delivered subpoenas to ``at least a dozen'' city agencies that have
had dealings with eight of Barry's close friends.
   The city records of those Barry associates were subpoenaed last
week.
   The new subpoenas were issued to determine whether there were
any irregularities in any contracts the mayor's friends have
received, sources said.
   Subpoenas were also issued Wednesday for a number of Barry's
telephone records, including the period surrounding Barry's arrest
at a downtown Washington hotel in January, a top city government
source said.
   The subpoenas for the mayor's office and car telephone records
include the periods from Jan. 1, 1988, through March 31, 1988, and
Jan. 1, 1989, through Jan. 23, 1990, the source said.
   Barry was arrested and charged with cocaine possession in an FBI
sting at a downtown Washington hotel Jan. 18. He left for a Florida
substance abuse treatment center Jan. 22.
   The mayor is now enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program
at the Fenwick Hall hospital outside Charleston, S.C.
   A senior Barry aide who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Barry, who returned to Washington on Tuesday, was returning to
South Carolina on Wednesday.
   Mundy said the mayor's treatment for alcoholism was going well
and that Barry was in good spirits.
   Barry, 53, did not speak to reporters as he entered and left the
courthouse.
   All but one of the charges stem from a 14-month investigation
into Barry's ties to convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis, who has
testified that he supplied the mayor with crack cocaine in December
1988.
   One possession charge involved the mayor's sting operation
arrest in January.
   If convicted of all charges, Barry could face a maximum penalty
of 20 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine.
   Before Barry's arrival at the courthouse Wednesday, 18 Guardian
Angels paraded outside. Many carried signs reading, ``Mr. Mayor, do
the right thing _ resign.'' All chanted: ``Barry, it's the time,
it's time for you to resign.''

<HEAD>DA Says No Criminal Charges Against Covenant House Founder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Manhattan district attorney says no charges
will be brought against the Rev. Bruce Ritter despite dubious
financial dealings by the founder of the nation's largest network
of runaway shelters.
   The Roman Catholic priest resigned as head of Covenant House on
Tuesday amid allegations of financial and sexual misconduct
involving young runaways.
   Ritter, 62, was involved in ``some questionable financial
transactions'' in his expenditures for a male prostitute, District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Wednesday.
   Morgenthau also said the law may have been violated when
Covenant House supplied the 26-year-old prostitute, Kevin Kite,
with a false identity using the papers of a dead 10-year-old.
   But in neither circumstance was there enough evidence to file
charges, said Morgenthau, who declined to elaborate on what his
investigators found to be questionable in Ritter's financial
dealings.
   Morgenthau said he was not concerned with sexual misconduct
because Kite is an adult and the allegations involving other youths
were beyond the statute of limitations. The sexual allegations are
the subject of a church investigation.
   Nothing in the probe ``cast into doubt the merits of Covenant
House's programs, which are widely _ and deservedly _ praised,''
Morgenthau said.
   ``Although Covenant House has had to endure a brief period of
adversity, I am confident that it will emerge from this episode a
stronger and more effective organization,'' he said.
   Ritter first put a few runaways up at his apartment in 1968.
Covenant House now has 17 shelters in the United States, Canada and
Latin America that care for 25,000 children. Nearly all of its $85
million budget comes from donations.
   A private audit has concluded that money spent on Kite was
properly documented and appeared to be appropriate to Covenant
House's mission.
   Former New York schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola, who had
been running Convenant House since Ritter took a leave of absence
Feb. 6, also resigned Tuesday.
   Macchiarola said he was forced out because he advocated outside
investigations into allegations of wrongdoing at Covenant House.
``I was the guy with the light and they said, you know what, it's
too bright in here,'' he said.
   But board chairman Ralph A. Pfeiffer Jr. said the board has
begun implementing Macchiarola's suggestions, including an audit
and an investigation by a former law enforcement official of any
allegations concerning Covenant House staff.
   The board named James J. Harnett, the executive vice president,
to run the organization until a permanent successor is found.
   Published reports have said contributions to Covenant House have
dropped since the allegations against Ritter surfaced, but Harnett
said the organization was in good financial condition.

<HEAD>Commodity Price Index Down</HEAD>

   Sharp declines for milk and eggs helped push
down the Agriculture Department's monthly commodity price index in
February, according to preliminary figures.
   Lower prices for lettuce and wheat also contributed to last
month's drop of 0.6 percent from the January average, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said Wednesday. Even so,
the index averaged 2.7 percent above the year-earlier level.
   Higher prices for cattle, broilers and tomatoes partly offset
the decline for the other commodities during the month.
   ``Tomato prices for February were at the highest level of
records,'' the report said. ``During the past two months prices
have been about twice the previous record established in March of
1985.''
   The price climb was due to short supplies caused by the December
freeze in Florida in December, the report said.
   The drop in milk prices paid to farmers, which had been at
record levels, was the largest month-to-month decline ever
recorded. The egg price drop was said to be the third-largest on
record.
   The report did not include new figures on farm expenses, which
are computed every three months. In January, however, new quarterly
figures showed that prices paid by farmers were up 1.1 percent from
October, the previous reading, and averaged 2.9 percent more than a
year earlier.
   Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990
may be in the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with
about $53 billion in 1989.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $44 billion to $49
billion, compared with $48 billion last year.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA economists to rise 3
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 5.7
percent in 1989, the sharpest rise since 1981.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the February price index for
livestock and poultry was down 0.6 percent from January but was up
8.2 percent from February 1989.
   Milk prices dropped 80 cents from January to $14.90 per 100
pounds but were still $1.80 more than a year ago.

   Food processors will have to be more specific
on their labels when certain flavorings are used in meat and
poultry products, the Agriculture Department says.
   Federal rules are being changed, effective today, to require
``proteinaceous material'' derived from livestock, poultry, eggs,
milk, plants and yeast to be listed on labels by their names.
   In the past, such substances could be listed simply as
``flavorings'' or similar terms.
   For example, a popular ``flavor agent'' or enhancer used for
years in hot dogs will have to be labeled ``milk protein
hydrolyzate.''
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Wednesday that the new rule,
proposed in August 1987, was adopted ``to better protect the public
health and serve the consumer's right to know'' what's in food
products.
   ``For many years, the agency has required labels for meat and
poultry products to list all ingredients,'' he said. ``However, an
exception was made to allow `natural flavoring' and similar terms
to designate substances which are often added as flavor enhancers,
emulsifiers, stabilizers, binders, extenders and nutrient sources
in products such as frankfurters and bologna.''
   Crawford said the exception was allowed because the additives
were primarily flavorings in meat and poultry products and did not
make a significant nutritional contribution.
   But he said the agency's ``paramount concern is public health''
and that it was found some people can have severe allergic
reactions to those substances.
   ``The agency is also concerned about a marked increase in the
use of these ingredients during the last decade,'' Crawford said.
``Some manufacturers may be using the substances inappropriately as
low-cost meat replacements.''
   Now, he said, consumers with allergies to certain substances can
tell if the product contains those ingredients.
   Crawford said meat and poultry processors will be allowed to
make label changes over six months, although the agency is working
closely with the companies to speed it up.
   At least one company is adding a stick-on label to its regular
packaging to further define the product ingredients, he said.

   China has bought an additional 160,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under an Agriculture Department price-subsidy
program.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday that three private
exporting companies made the deals under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for June, he said.
   The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized China under EEP
on Feb. 8. Previous allocations had been exhausted except for 1,050
tons.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $6.95 per ton, or
about 19 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Central States Enterprises
Inc., 40,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 29,700; and Cargill Inc.,
90,000.

<HEAD>Chamorro Insists On Civilian Control of Armed Forces</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President-elect Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro is insisting the Sandinistas ``turn over everything,''
including control of the army, but the opposition appears to be
backing down on its plan to denationalize the banks.
   ``I'm the one who is going to give orders,'' Mrs. Chamorro said
Wednesday at her first news conference since she upset the leftist
Sandinistas in Sunday's elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro made it clear that Gen. Humberto Ortega, President
Daniel Ortega's brother, would not be kept on as defense minister.
She did not say whether he would lose his rank or his second post
as commander of the army.
   ``They have to turn over everything,'' she said, adding that
``the minister of defense will be a civilian.''
   The leader of the victorious opposition coalition spoke as
transition talks began between teams headed by Humberto Ortega and
Antonio Lacayo, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and campaign manager.
   Control of the armed forces is a key issue for the transition
teams to settle before Mrs. Chamorro is inaugurated April 25 for a
six-year term.
   It appeared her United National Opposition (UNO) had decided to
give in on another key issue when a top aide said UNO would accede
to Sandinista insistence on keeping the banking system under
government control.
   ``The banks will stay nationalized,'' Francisco Mayorga, an
economic adviser to Mrs. Chamorro, said in an interview.
   Privatizing the banks had been one of UNO's campaign planks, but
on Tuesday the Sandinistas outlined a series of positions for
transition negotiations that opposed that plan.
   UNO's platform also calls for selling off many inefficient
state-owned companies and freeing the economy from state
restrictions, moves the Sandinistas oppose.
   Mayorga said he would travel to the United States seeking funds
to help Nicaragua climb out of an economic tailspin. Due in part to
a U.S. trade embargo that the Bush administration now says it will
lift, Nicaragua became one of the poorest nations in the Western
Hemisphere during the 1980s.
   Negotiations over the military may be a more difficult problem,
with UNO insisting on at least the appearance of control.
   President Ortega and his party have insisted army and security
forces must maintain their strength and their political connection
to the Sandinista party, especially while the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels are still a threat.
   Both Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro have called on the Contras to
disband immediately, but the Contras have said they will not
disband until Mrs. Chamorro takes office.
   ``The causes of civil war in Nicaragua have disappeared,'' she
told the news conference. By government count, about 60,000 people
have been killed or wounded in the 9-year-old war.
   Meanwhile, Ortega said he had ordered a halt in offensive
military operations, restoring a cease-fire that had ended Nov. 1.
   Ortega said the United States should help pay for demobilizing
and resettling the 10,000-man Contra army, which is based in
neighboring Honduras.
   U.S. funding for the Contras ran out Wednesday, although there
are probably enough supplies in the pipeline to keep aid flowing at
least a month or more.
   The United States has provided only non-lethal aid to the
Contras since February 1988.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who had been serving as a
mediator between the Sandinistas and UNO, returned Wednesday to the
United States but other members of international observer teams
remained behind.
   Former U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson dismissed UNO
complaints that the Sandinistas were trying to rig the vote in the
National Assembly to prevent UNO from getting the 60 percent it
needs to make constitutional changes.
   ``Everything is normal,'' he said.
   Current projections show UNO getting 52 seats in the assembly to
39 for the Sandinistas, including a seat for Ortega as a losing
presidential candidate who received more than 1 percent of the vote.
   One other presidential loser, Moises Hassan of the Revolutionary
Unity Movement, was on the edge of 1 percent; if he makes the cut
the legislature will number 92.
   The atmosphere in Managua appeared to relax as it became clear
the two sides were getting down to business, but in the city of
Masaya about 3,000 Sandinistas held a three-hour march Wednesday
night.
   The demonstrators, waving flags and wearing the red-and-black
neckerchiefs that symbolize the Sandinista movement, chanted
``Traitors to the firing squad!'' and ``They betrayed Daniel!'' as
they marched through the streets.
   Masaya, 18 miles southeast of Managua, is considered the cradle
of the Sandinista revolution that overthrew dictator Anastasio
Somoza in 1979.
   At least two people that the crowd suspected to be UNO
supporters were roughed up during the march, but no serious
injuries were reported.

<HEAD>Ag Official Say Low-Dose Irradiation Could Reduce Contamination</HEAD>

   A senior Agriculture Department official said
today that low-dose irradiation of meat and poultry could help
reduce contamination of the U.S. food supply by bacteria and other
organisms.
   ``The U.S. government does not believe its role is to advocate
food irradiation over other technologies,'' said Lester M.
Crawford, administrator of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service.
   ``However, we do view it as a viable method for ensuring a safe
and wholesome food supply, and want to ensure that food processors
have access to it.''
   Crawford's remarks were in a speech prepared for delivery today
at a conference in London. A text was released here by the agency.
   The Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve
irradiation for poultry products sometime in March, said Jim
Greene, a spokesman for Crawford.
   No irradiated meat or poultry products are sold in the United
States, Crawford said. Federal approval was granted in 1986 for the
treatment of fresh or previously frozen pork to control trichinae,
microscopic parasites that can cause trichinosis if contaminated
pork isn't cooked properly.
   ``Since that time, no firm has expressed an interest in
irradiating pork,'' he said. `` Therefore, further development of
the (USDA) regulations has been halted.''
   Crawford said his agency filed a petition with FDA in late 1986
asking for approval of ``ionizing radiation on packaged, fresh or
frozen poultry to reduce some food-borne pathogens'' such as
salmonella, a common micro-organism that can cause food poisoning.
   ``We filed the petition because microbial reduction on raw
products could have an important public health benefit, and a
technology with that potential deserves close attention and
study,'' he said.

<HEAD>Law Enforcement Officials Hail Opinion on Foreign Searches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcement officials, including a
prosecutor of ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, are hailing
a Supreme Court ruling that bolsters U.S. authority to conduct
searches in foreign countries.
   ``Drug traffickers and terrorists will take no cheer from the
court's opinion,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said after
Wednesday's decision.
   The ruling, he said, ``recognizes the right and need of law
enforcement officers to have lawful, practical means of dealing
with international drug trafficking operations.''
   The court said U.S. agents don't need warrants from American
judges to search the homes of non-U.S. citizens living abroad.
   ``We're happy to see it come,'' said U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen in Miami, whose office is prosecuting Noriega. ``It's
generally known that that's our position in the Noriega case, and
it's good news that the rules won't change.''
   Noriega surrendered after U.S. troops invaded Panama in December
in an effort to capture him. Noriega was brought to the United
States to stand trial on drug-trafficking and money-laundering
charges.
   There has been speculation Noriega's lawyers might argue that
U.S. armed forces illegally seized evidence in the invasion.
   Noriega defense attorney Steven Kollin said Wednesday before
reading the court opinion that it apparently would not apply
directly to Noriega's arrest, only material seized during searches
in Panama by U.S. authorities.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, upheld the warrantless search of
the home of a suspected Mexican drug smuggler.
   But some civil libertarians said the ruling does not give U.S.
agents a free hand to raid the homes of foreigners living abroad.
   Opinions by some justices suggest there might be five votes to
throw out evidence if agents act unreasonably, said Steven Shapiro
of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``It's a mistake to read it as carte blanche for authorities to
do whatever they want,'' he said, adding it the ruling is still
disappointing.
   ``Our view is that when American agents seize evidence for use
in an American trial in an American courtroom that can lead to
imprisonment in an American jail their behavior should be subject
to constitutional review,'' Shapiro said.
   In other rulings Wednesday, the court:
   _Gave police broad new authority to conduct sweeping searches in
this country after making arrests in private homes. Voting 7-2 in a
Maryland case, the justices said police may search a house when
they have a reasonable suspicion there is a hidden danger to the
arresting officers _ even if authorities lack a search warrant or
probable cause to believe there is a danger.
   _Said states may make the death penalty the only punishment for
some murderers without violating the Constitution's ban on
mandatory death sentences. The court, by a 5-4 vote, upheld a
Pennsylvania law.
   In the drug-smuggling case, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
said constitutional protection against unreasonable searches and
seizures does not apply to foreign property of aliens.
   ``Situations threatening to important American interests may
arise halfway around the globe ... (that) require an American
response with armed force,'' he said. ``If there are to be
restrictions on searches and seizures which occur incident to such
American action, they must be imposed by the political branches
through diplomatic understanding, treaty or legislation.''
   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said:
   ``If we expect aliens to obey our laws, aliens should be able to
expect that we will obey our Constitution when we investigate,
prosecute and punish them. Lawlessness breeds lawlessness.''
   The court ruled against suspected drug smuggler Rene Verdugo
Urquidez, convicted in California in 1988 of taking part in the
1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena
and his pilot.
   The search warrant issue arose in a separate but related,
prosecution in which the DEA searched his home in Mexicali, Mexico,
in 1988 with cooperation of Mexican authorities.

<HEAD>Panel Warns That Infant Mortality May Increase</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's infant mortality rate may rise
sharply if poor health trends aren't reversed, a national panel
says.
   ``The negative maternal and child health trends of the 1980s
cast a shadow on our children's future,'' said former Sen. Lawton
Chiles, a Florida Democrat who is chairman of the bipartisan
National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality.
   Smoking, drinking and drug use by pregnant women caused a
significant part of the infant death problem, the independent panel
said in a report Wednesday.
   Lives and money could be saved if greater access to prenatal and
pediatric care were provided to pregnant women and young children,
the report said.
   ``Progress in reducing infant mortality has stalled,'' Chiles
said. ``In the 1990s, we may see more infants die per year than the
40,000 we now lose before their first birthdays.''
   The report said progress in reducing the infant mortality rate
slowed from 4.7 percent per year in the 1970s to 2.7 percent per
year in the 1980s.
   It also cited:
   _An increased number of high-risk pregnant women. Use of crack
cocaine, women with AIDS and syphilis, and births to unmarried
mothers all increased during the 1980s. A 1988 survey found 11
percent of pregnant women use illegal drugs.
   _An increase in the black-white infant mortality gap. Black
infant mortality has been twice the white rate for years, and
recently the black rate has declined at a slower pace, resulting in
a widening of the gap.
   _Low birthweight infants. There was no improvement in the 1980s
in the percentage of infants born under 5.5 pounds.
   _Inadequate prenatal care. The number of women obtaining late or
no prenatal care increased between 1980 and 1987. The increase was
17 percent for whites and 26 percent for blacks. In 1987, more than
74,000 pregnant women received no prenatal care _ a 50 percent
increase over the 1980 rate.
   The commission cited figures showing the United States ranked
20th among developed countries in the rate of infant mortality in
1987.

<HEAD>Some Drug Companies Offered Illegal Gratuities, Testimony Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transcripts of testimony by a former Food and
Drug Administration official paint a picture of illegal gratuities
and bribe attempts by some generic drug companies trying to get
their products approved.
   Martin Seife, former director of the FDA's generic drug
division, told a House investigations subcommittee that in 1974 he
was sent a $300 color television set by a generic drug company. He
returned the TV set.
   He also told the panel of two instances in which FDA employees
were given envelopes of cash _ ``many thousand dollar bills'' in
one case _ by a consultant to a generic drug company.
   Seife testified in secret before the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee May 3, before he retired from the FDA.
He was a principal source for the subcommittee, which uncovered
fraud and bribery in the FDA's generic drug division and has led to
convictions of three generic drug company executives and three
former FDA employees.
   Of the 1974 incident, Seife said he received a package in the
mail at his home from Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. of Copiague,
N.Y., and when he unwrapped it, he was ``shocked and chagrined'' to
find a color TV set.
   He said he sent it back immediately and ``nobody ever approached
me in this manner again.''
   Included in the transcripts was a letter to Seife from Robert
Shulman, then president of Bolar, apologizing ``for an unfortunate
incident that I'm sure embarrassed both of us.'' Shulman recently
resigned as president and chief executive officer but remains on
Bolar's board.
   The letter explained: ``I just meant to say thank you to someone
I felt had shown us some understanding and compassion that he
didn't have to.''
   Eugene Pfeifer, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing Bolar,
said he was aware of the incident but added, ``We have no reason to
believe it was a practice. ... We're not aware of anything else
like that.''
   Such a gift would be considered an illegal gratuity. Though the
statute of limitations on prosecution has expired, the transcripts
have been turned over to the U.S. attorney in Baltimore for
determination of whether it represents part of a pattern of
conduct, said a subcommittee source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Seife said two FDA employees reported attempts to bribe them by
a generic drug company consultant. In one of the cases, the man
``dropped an envelope with many thousand dollar bills'' on the desk
of one of the agency's consumer safety officers in early February
1988.
   The safety officer, Harvey Greenberg, ``became quite dismayed
and chased this fellow into the men's room and stuffed the envelope
back in his pocket,'' and reported the incident to Seife the next
day, Seife said.
   Greenberg has appeared before a federal grand jury in Baltimore
that has been investigating the generic drug scandal.
   The scandal became public last spring. The investigation also
uncovered evidence that some drug companies had cheated on FDA
potency tests, which prompted recalls of dozens of generic drugs,
including both generic versions of the widely prescribed high blood
pressure drug Dyazide.
   Bolar recalled its version of Dyazide in January after the
company's lawyers said documents supporting claims about the drug
appeared to be falsified.

<HEAD>Panel Says Indian Remains Belong With Tribes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The skeletal remains of Indians belong with
their tribes, say panel members who spent a year trying to settle
the controversy about who has the right to bones and burial objects
held by museums.
   ``I am told that at the outset the positions of tribal leaders
and the museum community were worlds apart,'' Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs, said at a Wednesday news conference announcing the panel's
findings.
   The panel was appointed after anthropologists joined the
American Association of Museums two years ago in opposing
legislation that would have returned the remains and objects to
tribes.
   After a year of discussions, the panel is proposing Congress
pass a law to assure that remains are handled properly. The
process, Inouye said, would emphasize that ``respect for Indian and
native human rights is the paramount principle to govern
repatriation claims.''
   Under the process suggested by the panel, tribal leaders would
request the remains and burial artifacts they know to belong to
their ancestors. Museums are expected to comply.
   The panel also said museums should start inventories of Indian
remains and materials and begin talking to tribes about
repatriation.
   President Bush signed a bill in November requiring the
Smithsonian Institution to return the remains it holds to the
proper tribes.
   ``Unfortunately, the old policies of the rest of the federal
government, as well as non-federal museums or similar institutions
which receive federal funds, are not affected by this law,'' said
panel member Walter Echo-Hawk.
   ``These agencies and institutions continue to remain free to
withhold untold thousands of native dead from proper reburial by
their tribes and peoples of origin.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who oversaw the work of the panel,
said the report and recommendations would make it possible to
proceed with legislation. However, a McCain aide said no bill had
been written.
   McCain said the group didn't reach full consensus on
repatriation of remains and objects from tribes that no longer
exist.
   ``We will continue to try to resolve this issue,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall, Dollar Rises Sharply in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
again Thursday while the dollar rose sharply against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 762.41 points, or 2.20
percent, to close at 33,829.58.
   The dollar closed at 149.78 yen, up 1.26 yen from Wednesday's
close of 148.52 yen. After opening at 149.35 yen, the currency
moved in a range of 149.35-149.90 yen.
   ``The largest concern among market players is the foreign
exchange situation,'' said Yoshiro Inoue of Nomura Securities Co.
   In addition to the weaker yen, securities dealers attributed the
fall in the Nikkei to profit-taking by investors, who took
advantage of gains in the previous two days.
   ``There was substantial selling by those eager to unload their
holdings which were badly depreciated during the stock market
debacle in the past week,'' said Ichitaro Watanabe of Nikko
Securities Co.
   Share prices on the world's most affluent market made a dramatic
recovery over the last two days after Monday's second-largest
single-day plunge.
   On Wednesday, the stock market's leading indicator had gained
694.04 points, or 2.04 percent, topping a 576.08-point rise on
Tuesday. On Monday, the index fell 1,569.10 points, its worst since
the October 1987 ``Black Monday'' global crash. The index is down
more than 10 percent this year.
   Falling Japanese government bond prices also discouraged stock
investors, Inoue said. Lower bond prices boost interest rates,
which makes stock investment less attractive.
   However, he said there weren't many aggressive sellers during
the morning and that there was no notable amount of arbitrage
selling.
   Analysts have blamed computer-aided arbitrage selling, which
profits from price gaps between actual stocks and stock-index
futures, for the market's recent decline.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange advised 10 foreign and domestic major
securities firms after Monday's big drop not to file arbitrage-sell
orders after trading sessions begin if the indicator is falling.
   In the currency market, dealers said the dollar's sharply higher
opening was a carry-over from its overnight surge on overseas
markets.
   In New York, the dollar rose to 149.08 yen, up from 148.73 late
Tuesday as traders.
   ``The dollar is higher not only against the yen but also against
almost all the other major currencies,'' said a trader with the
Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Market players are trying to see how much higher they can push
it, he said. In the preceding six trading days, it had climbed a
total of 4.51 yen, reaching its highest level since last June.
   Falling Japanese government bond prices resulting from the yen's
continuing plunge and the stock market's downswing this morning
also made the yen less attractive to investors, he said.
   ``The dollar is likely to rise to around 150-yen before long,''
the trader added.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, has been
intervening heavily in recent days, selling dollars in an attempt
to support the yen. The bank does not officially comment on its
monetary actions.
   An official at the central bank said the bank will continue to
intervene for the time being, but ``we will consider other measures
as deemed necessary'' to stem the fall of the yen, Kyodo News
Service reported.

<HEAD>Study: Stethoscope as Good as Electronic Monitor During Childbirth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a confirmation of time-honored ways, a study
today concludes that the old-fashioned stethoscope is just as good
as electronic monitors _ and maybe even better _ for checking
babies during birth.
   The researchers found signs that cerebral palsy may be more
common among infants whose births are electronically monitored,
possibly because the monitors led doctors to wait longer before
acting to rescue a baby in distress.
   But they cautioned that this finding could be a statistical
fluke. Experts said, moreover, that monitors are likely to remain
in use, in part because they require less manpower in the delivery
room.
   Electronic fetal monitors were introduced in the early 1970s and
now are a fixture of delivery rooms everywhere. Still, doctors have
only recently begun rigorous testing to see if the machines help
produce healthier babies.
   ``It's our view that although widely used, electronic fetal
monitoring during labor and delivery of high-risk infants appears
to have no effect on children's survival or neurological health,''
said Dr. Kirkwood K. Shy of the University of Washington in Seattle.
   His study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
was performed at the University of Washington Hospital in Seattle,
Grace Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Madigan Army
Hospital in Tacoma, Wash.
   The monitors are used to listen to the unborn baby's heart. The
electronic blip-blip of the fetal heartbeat is typically broadcast
through the delivery room. If abnormalities are heard, doctors may
choose to rescue the baby with a Caesarean section or forceps.
   Dr. Benjamin Sachs of Boston's Beth Israel Hospital called the
latest findings ``very significant,'' but added:
   ``It's unlikely that the fetal monitor will be abandoned. We
have an enormous investment in fetal monitoring equipment and a
whole generation of physicians who have been trained in the
technique.''
   In addition, he said, a monitor requires fewer nurses than the
more laborious practice of regularly checking with stethoscopes, so
``it is cheaper and more efficient.''
   Shy notes that in part, the successful use of stethoscopes
results from two decades of experience with electronic monitors.
The two methods provide essentially the same information, and the
wide use of electronic monitors has taught doctors what warning
signs they need to listen for with their stethoscopes.
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises
that mothers giving high-risk births have either continuous
electronic monitoring or be checked with stethoscopes every 15
minutes in the first stage of labor and every five minutes in the
second stage.
   The latest study was conducted on 93 children whose mothers had
been randomly assigned to undergo electronic monitoring or checking
with stethoscopes. All their babies were premature and weighed less
than four pounds.
   Tests of mental and physical development showed that the babies
in both groups were about the same 18 months after birth. But 20
percent of the babies in the electronically monitored group had
suffered cerebral palsy, compared with 8 percent of those checked
with stethoscopes.
   Cerebral palsy is partial loss of muscle control that can result
from many causes, including brain damage during birth. Whether the
premature babies in the electronic monitoring group suffered this
condition more often because of poor blood flow to the brain during
birth is unclear.
   However, doctors were quicker to perform Caesareans when they
heard heartbeat abnormalities through their stethoscopes than on
the electronic monitors. On average, electronically monitored
babies in distress were delivered about 45 minutes later than were
those checked with stethoscopes.
   ``We can only conjecture'' why doctors waited longer with
electronic monitoring, Shy said. ``One explanation is that somehow
the presence of information given from a machine was overly
reassuring in the labor room.''
   He added that because only 23 children in the study had cerebral
palsy, ``we can't exclude the possibility that the result may have
occurred on the basis of chance alone.''

<HEAD>Kohl: Germanys Should Make Formal Declarations Supporting Polish
Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seeking to soothe domestic and
international critics, Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he recognizes
Poland's desire for a legal guarantee that a united Germany would
not seek to return to its prewar borders.
   However, Kohl on Wednesday night reiterated his view that only
the government of a reiunified Germany could have final say about a
possible treaty giving formal German recognition of the current
border.
   Speaking in an interview with East German television Wednesday
night, Kohl seemed annoyed over worries, even among his allies,
about his stance on the border issue.
   ``In many speeches I have said that no one wants to connect the
unity of the Germans with moving the borders. I don't know what
more I can say,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl has come under sharp criticism abroad and at home for what
is seen as an unclear position on lands east of the Oder and Neisse
rivers once held by Germany and now part of Poland.
   The land _ about one-third of present-day Poland _ was awarded
to Poland after the defeat in 1945 of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   In an apparent effort not to alienate his most conservative
constituents, Kohl has never formally stated that a united Germany
would not lay claim to that land and this is viewed as a major
difficulty in the unification process.
   Poland, the United States and Britain, among others, have
expressed concern over what they consider Kohl's lack of action.
   Kohl, apparently seeking to ease the criticism, told his Cabinet
Wednesday he ``understands the Polish wish for a legally binding
recognition'' of Poland's western borders, said government
spokesman Dieter Vogel.
   The chancellor also said he sees the possibility that after East
Germany's elections on March 18, the parliaments of both Germanys
could issue declarations on the matter, said Vogel.
   Vogel said such a declaration could confirm a resolution already
passed by the West German parliament on Nov. 8 stating that Germans
``neither now nor in the future'' will attempt to change the border.
   Kohl said only that the ``highest sovereign German power in the
case of reunification'' could conclude such a treaty.
   He also dismissed any fears of the rise of a ``Fourth Reich'' as
``rubbish.'' ``The Germans are completely immersed in international
responsibility,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl has sought to allay the worries of Poles, whose country was
devastated by the Nazis, but at the same time has insisted that
only a united Germany could take an official stand on the border
issue.
   The opposition Social Democrats have charged that with such
pronouncements, Kohl is endangering international support for
German unification.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the Social Democrats, said Wednesday
that Kohl's statements about the border issue have been
``irresponsible and detrimental ... to German interests.''
   At the other end of the argument is West Germany's 2
million-strong Association of Exiles, which says it would take
legal action if a united Germany formally recognized Poland's
western border.
   In East Germany, the president of the government-run bank
announced Wednesday that it planned to switch to a Western-style
banking system, with an autonomous central bank aiming for monetary
stability by controlling the monetary supply.
   Such a move would make it more compatible with West Germany's
Bundesbank and other Western European central banks.
   Horst Kaminsky's comments were carried by ADN, the East German
news agency.
   Since ousting hard-line Communist rulers last fall, East Germans
have adopted economic reforms to encourage free enterprise and
foreign investment and facilitate better integration with West
Germany's economy.

<HEAD>Reform Effort Tested as Councils Fire Principals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's sweeping education reform effort is
getting its first major test as principals learn whether they're
being rehired or fired by parents.
   Although the process is being declared a success at most
schools, teachers and students in the nation's third-largest school
system are protesting some firings, and accusations of backroom
deals and bigotry have surfaced.
   These disruptions have raised doubts about the effectiveness of
the councils that were elected in October as part of a package to
improve Chicago's troubled schools by putting more power in the
hands of local communities.
   Under the 1988 reform law, half the 540 community councils _ one
for each of the 71 high schools and 469 elementary schools _ decide
this year whether to terminate their principals' four-year
contracts. The 270 other councils vote on their principals next
year.
   About 10 percent of the principals under consideration are
expected to lose their jobs, said School Board spokesman Ken Moses.
The councils have until April 15 to announce their decisions.
   The School Board said it has no figures on how many principals
have been notified so far.
   The reform law was passed because of the double-digit dropout
rate, poor test scores, violence and other ills that led William
Bennett, then the federal education secretary, to label Chicago's
school system as the nation's worst in 1987.
   The councils consist of six parents and five other members,
including teachers and the principal at each school in the
410,000-student system.
   The principals have no say on their own contracts, which range
from about $40,000 to $70,000 a year, and fired principals have no
recourse other than reconsideration by the councils, said Bob
Saigh, another board spokesman.
   David Peterson, principal at the Wells High School for 13 years,
is among the principals fighting their dismissal notices.
   Many of the 1,700 students at the mostly Hispanic school staged
a sit-in Tuesday to protest the firing, announced the day before.
The faculty has written to Superintendent Ted Kimbrough, who has
said he would intervene if it appeared councils acted improperly.
   Assistant Principal Miguel Trujillo said Peterson ``has the
support of the community, the student body, the faculty and the
staff.''
   ``The councils are using hidden agendas ... regardless of how
the school community feels,'' Trujillo said.
   Peterson said the councils are being asked to act too quickly,
without enough information. ``One council member said I was too
strict, another said I was too easy,'' he said. ``One said she was
looking for a Hispanic.''
   ``I've never felt that I had a divine right to be principal of
anything,'' Peterson said. ``But I don't believe that local
councils were set up to turn schools into bastions of racism or
ethnicity.''
   Dan Solis, executive director of the United Neighborhood
Organization, a community group active in the reform effort, said
the racism charges were false. ``It's just presenting the bogeyman
out there,'' Solis said.
   Allegations of discrimination also have surfaced at Burns
Elementary School, where council members said they voted not to
renew principal Donald Kriz's contract because he wouldn't
cooperate with them.
   ``They want him out because he's not Hispanic, and that's the
bottom line,'' said fifth-grade teacher Lorraine Stepanek, who was
among teachers picketing Wednesday outside the school in a mostly
Hispanic district.
   Donald Moore, whose Designs for Change group helped shape the
reform package, said the protests are ``part of a process called
democracy.''
   ``We're talking about schools that are failing miserably across
the city,'' he said. ``There is need for new leadership in many
schools and it's totally predictable that people ... at risk of
losing their jobs are going to try to hang onto them.''
   The School Board defends its decision to empower the councils.
   ``This is the first year this has been done,'' Moses said.
``Whenever you have a new system ... somebody's not going to be
pleased. But if you can manage to satisfy the majority, then I
think you can call it a success.''

   Communist North Korea has summoned
about 2,000 of its students and engineers from Eastern Europe and
sent them to isolated rural areas to halt the spread of
``ideological taint,'' a newspaper reported today.
   The Kookmin Ilbo newspaper quoted South Korean government
sources as saying the students and engineers were held in a
re-education camp outside the North Korean capital of Pyongyang for
up to two months before being sent to remote education facilities
or factories.
   The North Koreans were ordered to return from East Germany,
Romania, Hungary and three other Eastern European countries
undergoing democratic upheaval, the Seoul newspaper said.
   Popular uprisings toppled hard-line Communist rulers in
Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania
last year.
   The newspaper said North Korea also wants about 500 students
studying in the Soviet Union to return this year because
pro-democracy protests are now occuring there but authorities took
no action for fear of stirring a diplomatic conflict.
   North Korea has stated that it has no intention of changing its
current political course and that its society would not be affected
by changes in Eastern Europe.
   No official comment was immediately available. South Korean
officials have said North Korea has tightened ideological control
since neighboring China crushed a pro-democracy uprising led by
students in June.

   Nahum N. Glatzer, a scholar, editor and
author of numerous works on literature and Judaism, has died at 86.
   The Watertown, Mass., resident, who wrote more than 250 books
and articles on subjects ranging from Franz Kafka to Jewish prayer,
died Tuesday after several days in a coma in Tucson, where he was
spending the winter.
   A founder of Schocken Books in Germany, he remained an editor
after the publishing company moved to the United States during the
Nazi era.
   Glatzer was born in Austria and in 1931 earned a Ph.D. from the
University of Frankfurt, where he was philosopher Martin Buber's
successor as lecturer on Jewish religious history and ethics.
   In 1933, Glatzer and his wife fled to Palestine, where he taught
literature. They moved to the United States in 1938.
   Glatzer began teaching at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.,
in 1950 and was chairman of the department of Near Eastern and
Judaic studies for 11 years. He later became a professor of
religion at Boston University.
   Among his works are ``History of the Talmudic Age,'' ``The
Beginnings of Post-Biblical Judaism'' and ``The Dimensions of Job.''
   He is survived by his wife, Anne; a son; a daughter, and two
grandchildren.
   Funeral services were set for today in Lexington, Mass.

<HEAD>Woman Sues to Keep Divorce Out of Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Newport Daily News is fighting a
lawsuit by a woman who wants to keep the paper from publishing her
name once her divorce is final.
   A lawyer for the woman, identified only as Jane Doe, said she is
not a public figure and that a divorce notice would violate her
right to privacy.
   ``Unfortunately, divorce carries with it, albeit for personal or
religious reasons, a social stigma,'' said Thomas W. Kelly. ``She
fears that the mere publication of her name intrudes on her life,
her husband's life and her future.''
   The suit, filed Tuesday, is designed to force the news media
``to scrutinize the information and to prevent them from publishing
information about marital breakdowns unless there is a reasonable
element of newsworthiness.''
   The Daily News for years has published monthly the names and
addresses of people for whom final divorce decrees were entered in
Newport County Family Court.
   Editor David B. Offer said in a statement Wednesday that
publishing information about divorces, ``which are on the public
record for all to see, is a normal and important practice for
newspapers all over the country.'
   ``For very good reasons, the right to provide this information
to readers is protected by the First Amendment,'' he said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that newspapers cannot be
barred from publishing truthful information from open court
records. But Kelly said the court signaled its willingness to allow
exceptions with a ruling last June.
   In that case, the court said a rape victim could not recover
damages against a paper that published her name in violation of a
Florida ``rape shield'' law.
   But Kelly said the court also stated that ``case-by-case
analysis of press-privacy conflicts by the court is appropriate.''

<HEAD>CDC Says Foreigners With AIDS Should be Allowed to Visit U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Centers for Disease Control says
foreigners who have AIDS or virtually any other contagious disease
should be allowed into the country.
   Along with AIDS, the CDC is recommending removing from the list
all other contagious diseases except infectious tuberculosis, a
federal official said Wednesday.
   The CDC recommendation on AIDS is largely symbolic, however,
because the list still would include infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. That restriction
was imposed by Congress.
   The recommendation by the CDC to remove AIDS is seen as
``signaling Congress that they should take HIV off'' the list as
well, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The immigration regulations concerning AIDS have been protested
by AIDS activist groups, including the National Commission on AIDS
and the World Health Organization.
   Several groups, including the National Association of People
with AIDS, have said they will boycott two major AIDS conferences
in the United States this year unless the restrictions are changed.

<HEAD>FDA Asked to Strengthen Warning on Birth Control Pills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A private health group wants the Food and Drug
Administration to require stronger warnings on labels of oral
contraceptives.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group said Wednesday that its
review of 13 studies published since 1977 shows women under 45 who
use birth control pills for many years may be at increased risk of
developing breast cancer.
   An FDA advisory committee, in January 1989, recommended no
changes in use of the pill, saying research on a possible link to
breast cancer was inconclusive and more study was needed.
   More than 13 million women in the United States between the ages
of 15 and 44 use oral contraceptives.
   Fourteen studies published in the past decade found no link
between the pill and breast cancer, but few of these examined women
who began using the pill at a young age and continued for many
years, the group said.

<HEAD>Bass Moratorium Goes Into Effect Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey's commercial and sport fishermen
face $1,000 penalties and seizure of their vessels beginning today
if they catch or sell striped bass in coastal waters.
   The state's failure to meet a Wednesday deadline for protecting
the striped bass with catch limits prompted two federal agencies to
impose the sales and fishing moratorium.
   The federal agencies said the moratorium would be lifted when
the state comes into compliance with the Atlantic Striped Bass
Conservation Act.
   According to Bob Itchmoney, assistant director of the New Jersey
Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife, the state assembly's
Conservation and Natural Resources Committee scheduled a hearing
for this morning on striped bass legislation.
   In the meantime, a special task force of agents from the Fish
and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are
ready to enforce the moratorium, with help from the Coast Guard.
   The striped bass began receiving federal protection after a
decade-long population decline. The Fish and Wildlife Service,
working with Maryland and Virginia, has stocked more than 3 million
hatchery-raised striped bass in the Chesapeake Bay since 1985 to
help bring the fish population back.

<TEXT>
   The aftermath of Sunday's election has
been surprisingly calm, and a lot of that has been to President
Daniel Ortega's credit.
   The Sandinistas agreed to the rules of the game, and they
haven't changed their minds just because it didn't work out as
expected.
   ``If you have elections, you run the risk of losing those
elections,'' Ortega said Wednesday, speaking to members of
international groups who support the Sandinistas.
   Ortega was beaten in the vote by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in
an upset that stunned his party, which never imagined it could lose.
   While the Sandinistas have been adjusting psychologically to
defeat and a life in the opposition, Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party
coalition has been trying to make things as easy as possible.
   ``We have to leave them alone; we can't push them. They're tense
and it's dangerous to push them now,'' said a senior strategist for
her United National Opposition (UNO).
   UNO has asked its supporters to go straight home after work and
not to gloat in victory or even provide a target for an incident.
   The victorious coalition had predicted widespread aggression and
intimidation by Sandinista militants _ something that has occurred
in the past.
   Others thought the Sandinistas, with roots in Marxist and
Leninist ideology, would not give up state power under any
conditions.
   Neither fear has been realized. Although there have been
isolated incidents _ a drunken bottle-tossing clash; an UNO
campaign headquarters occupied; a murder-suicide between neighbors
_ there has been no sign of a systematic effort to subvert the
election results.
   And both sides have begun to show a businesslike side as they
begin difficult negotiations over the terms of a transfer of power.
   The decisive contribution has come from Ortega. He commands
loyalty and love from much of the party, which remains the
strongest and most cohesive political force in Nicaragua.
   ``If he concedes defeat, there's nothing the others (Sandinista
leaders) can do. It's in his hands,'' UNO political strategist
Alfredo Cesar said shortly before the voting.
   With the army and security forces under close party control,
with arms distributed to labor unions, agricultural cooperatives
and other rank-and-file groups, the Sandinistas could have tried to
hold on by force.
   But that was not the point, Ortega said Wednesday.
   ``The big question is this,'' he said. ``Did the FSLN
(Sandinista Front) make the revolution to maintain itself as the
only governing party in Nicaragua; or did the FLSN make the
revolution to open a democratic space that never before existed in
this country?''
   Although Ortega's answer has been clear, not all his supporters
have agreed. Early in the week Sandinista radio stations were
flooded with calls from party members urging Ortega to ignore the
election results.
   In his speeches since his defeat, Ortega has both recognized
that passion and tried to calm the waters.
   ``To these inflamed people who shout that they (those who voted
for UNO) sold themselves, that they betrayed us, I say that the
people can't betray themselves, but they can make a mistake,''
Ortega replied.
   In six years, when Mrs. Chamorro's term is up, the worm will
turn, he said. Besides, Ortega noted, the Sandinistas remain the
largest single party in the country and will be able to defend
themselves in the National Assembly.
   The word went out after a meeting of 1,500 party leaders from
around the nation on Wednesday. The Sandinista discipline asserted
itself.
   ``It's bad for our morale, bad for our morale,'' said Mario
Ramirez, a member of a Sandinista neighborhood committee. ``The
people were tricked. The peasants, the people Daniel favored, they
were fooled.
   ``But we'll do them in in six years,'' he said.
   On a practical level, there remain tough and potentially
inflammatory issues to negotiate before Mrs. Chamorro takes office.
   While UNO wants control of the army, the Sandinistas don't want
the army changed while U.S.-supported Contras still roam the hills.
   But the two sides showed signs of working together. When former
President Jimmy Carter suggested that Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro call
for immediate Contra disbandment, both did so within hours.
   UNO already appears to be pulling back from a platform plank
calling for denationalization of the banks.
   Even the issue of army control may be subject to compromise.
   Mrs. Chamorro said a civilian would replace Ortega's brother,
Gen. Humberto Ortega, as defense minister, but a knowledgeable
source suggested the civilian might be a Sandinista selected by UNO.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The list of major obstacles to a
smooth transition of power from the Sandinista party to the United
National Opposition alliance is short but deep:
   _ Military: The Sandinistas want the Sandinista People's Army
and the Ministry of the Interior left intact, especially while the
U.S.-backed Contras remain a force in being. UNO wants to trim
them, de-politicize them and change the Army's name.
   _ Contras: President Daniel Ortega has demanded immediate
demobilization of the U.S-backed rebels, and President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has agreed. But the Contras themselves
say they will not dismantle until Mrs. Chamorro is sworn in April
25.
   _ Economy: The Sandinistas want the highly nationalized economic
structure left intact; UNO has already agreed not to re-privatize
the banks. But their plan calls for decentralizing Nicaragua's
economy and selling off inefficient public enterprises, something
that may cost jobs _ anathema to the Sandinistas.
   _ Confiscations: The Sandinistas want the lands, houses and
companies confiscated during their 10{ years in power kept by the
state or those to whom the properties were given. UNO will probably
leave confiscated lands in present hands, but wants to return
companies to their private owners.

<HEAD>Minn. Abortion Bill Stays in Committee; Consent Bill Signed in
S.C.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   A Minnesota Senate committee dealt a setback to a bill that
would ban virtually all abortions, while South Carolina's governor
signed a law requiring girls under 17 to get permission from a
judge or parent to have an abortion.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said Wednesday that the new law ``has to
do with the family. It has to do with government saying the family
should be included in decisions and not excluded by government, and
I think that's important.''
   In Minnesota, a bill prohibiting abortions for ``birth-control
reasons'' received a tie vote from the 16-member Senate Health and
Human Services Committee. Bills need a majority vote to clear
committee.
   ``A bill is always alive as long as the session is on,'' said
Sen. Gene Waldorf, the legislation's Senate sponsor.
   The bill was drafted as model legislation by the National
Right-To-Life Committee following last summer's U.S. Supreme
Court's Webster decision, which gave states more leeway to restrict
abortions.
   Witnesses on both sides said the legislation would be the
toughest anti-abortion measure in the nation, prohibiting an
estimated 93 percent of the abortions performed in the state, a
stronghold of anti-abortion sentiment.
   The new South Carolina law says that beginning in June, girls
must have the permission of a judge, parent or guardian to have an
abortion. Incest victims are not subject to the law, but rape
victims are.
   Previously, South Carolina law required girls under 16 to obtain
a parent's consent for an abortion. But similar laws without a
so-called judicial consent option have been declared
unconstitutional in other states.

<HEAD>Army Called Out to Stop Clashes Following Elections</HEAD>

   The army was called out to stop election
violence in a constituency where police gunfire and battles between
political rivals left at least 13 people dead, police and news
reports said today.
   Wednesday's deaths in Haryana state's Meham district raised to
98 the number of people killed during voting for eight state
assemblies and scattered by-elections in the world's most populous
democracy.
   Incomplete results showed the Congress Party of former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi losing heavily as the governing National
Front coalition and its electoral ally, the Hindu right-wing
Bharatiya Janata Party, made sweeping gains.
   The United News of India said the National Front and the
Bharatiya Janata Party had won 563 of the 775 contests for which
results had been announced. Congress had won just 147. Other seats
went to left-wing groups and independents.
   The election deaths include at least 80 people killed Tuesday in
the eastern state of Bihar, known for its organized criminal gangs.
Other deaths have been reported from the states of Gujarat and
Maharashtra, which also went to the polls Tuesday.
   Rival political supporters fought pitched battles in Meham on
Wednesday when an another vote was ordered in some polling centers
following allegations of electoral fraud.
   A police spokesman in Chandigarh, the Haryana state capital,
said three people died in the fighting, and another 10 were fatally
shot when police opened fire to control rioting mobs.
   Voting was suspended and the army called out to maintain peace
after the killings, said the spokesman, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules.
   Newspapers have blamed most of the vote fraud in Meham on Om
Prakash Chauthala, Haryana state's chief minister and the son of
India's deputy prime minister, Devi Lal.
   Chauthala was a National Front candidate for the Haryana state
assembly from the Meham district.
   The Hindu newspaper said armed gangs ``were seen to be moving
from booth to booth in the chief minister's constituency and
getting the ballot papers stamped in his favor.''
   Chauthala was named Haryana's chief minister, the state's top
elected administrator, after his father resigned from the post in
December to join the federal government.
   Under Indian law, any person appointed to a state or the federal
cabinet has up to six months to contest an election. The appointee
must win the poll for his selection to be ratified.
   Results from the polling show the Congress Party being voted out
of power in at least five of the eight states where elections were
held this week.
   The United News of India said the National Front and the
Bharatiya Janata Party had won most of the seats in Orissa, Madhya
Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan states and were
set to form governments.
   Complete results from Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra
states are not expected until Friday.
   A total of 1,610 seats were at stake and the Congress Party had
fielded candidates in all but 30 of them. The National Front and
the Bharatiya Janata Party fielded about 1,000 candidates each,
agreeing to ``friendly contests'' in some constituencies.

   Fire spread by high winds from an outdoor
tent heavily damaged a six-story Sheraton hotel early today, and
authorities said 10 people were killed and about 70 injured.
   Guests, some in pajamas or underwear, jumped from upper floors
of the luxury hotel or attached bedsheets to windowsills and
slipped down to safety, the newspaper Al-Akhbar said.
   Police Brig. Abdel-Rehim el-Kenawy said two of those killed were
French nationals. At least three Americans were among those
seriously injured, a hospital official said.
   The front of the modern 630-room Heliopolis Sheraton Hotel,
including lobbies, restaurants and other facilities, was destroyed
and about a third of the hotel was blackened. About 1,000 guests
and 300 employees were at the hotel when the fire broke out,
Al-Akhbar reported.
   There was no immediate word on the cause of the fire.
   A hotel official said it had been receiving _ every few months _
anonymous threatening letters demanding that alcoholic drinks be
banned and that the hotel's nightclub be shut down.
   Such demands are customarily heard from extremist Moslem
fundamentalist groups. But there were no indications so far linking
them to the hotel fire.
   Fardos Mohammed el-Sayed, staying at the hotel with her husband,
a newly married son and his bride, said the family had to leave
their two-room suite in bedclothes.
   ``We were going to sleep when suddenly we heard foreigners
shouting in English `Fire! Fire!' and we heard people running in
corridors,'' said Mrs. el-Sayed. ``We went down thinking it was a
small thing and left everything behind.''
   With more than 30 fire units on the scene, including some from
the army, the fire still burned eight hours after it broke out at
about 1 a.m.
   Helmeted riot police carrying shields ringed the hotel as
firefighters and rescue teams worked.
   Victor Lewis, assistant manager of the Cairo Sheraton, flagship
of the chain's six hotels in Egypt, said the blaze began in the
Nubian Tent, a restaurant where tourists watch belly-dancing and
other traditional Egyptian amusements.
   The restaurant is in a tent adjacent the hotel's outer wall.
Winds quickly spread the fire.
   ``One problem was that some guests opened their windows to see
what was going on,'' Lewis said. ``As a result, sparks went into
their rooms driven by the strong winds,'' which spread the fire
into the building.
   The injured were taken to nearby Heliopolis Hospital and the
Palestine Red Crescent Hospital.
   Dr. Samiri Sultan, director of the Heliopolis Hospital, said he
received seven dead and 31 injured. Sultan said six of the 17 badly
injured were from France; three each from the United States,
Britain and Egypt; one from Finland; and one had dual
Mexican-Lebanese citizenship.
   At the Palestinian Red Crescent Hospital, Dr. Hassan Kamil said
nine people, including two Canadians and a Dane, had been admitted
with bone fractures, smoke inhalation and bruises.
   A spokesman from Egypt's emergency medical services said about
70 people were injured. Sheraton officials said some slightly
injured guests did not go to hospitals but received first-aid
treatment after being transferred to other hotels.
   About 10 years old, the Heliopolis Sheraton is near the Cairo
International Airport. The hotel's lobby was among the most
elaborate in Cairo, designed in the motif of a tropical greenhouse
with live birds flitting among the plants.

<HEAD>Stocks Decline, Dollar Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index shifted
from dramatic recovery back to sharp decline today as declines in
the bond market and the yen's value discouraged investors.
   After a two-day rise, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
762.41 points, or 2.20 percent, closing at 33,829.58.
   Meanwhile, despite central bank intervention, the dollar rose by
1.26 yen, closing at 149.78 yen, its highest close since 151.30 yen
last June 15. Despite a pause in its climb on Wednesday, it has
gained 5.26 yen since Feb. 19. The dollar opened today at 149.35
and ranged between 149.35 yen and 149.90 yen.
   On the stock exchange, ``the largest concern among market
players is the foreign exchange situation,'' Yoshiro Inoue of
Nomura Securities Co. said.
   The weak yen makes Japanese shares less attractive, and also
affects the bond market _ another influence on the stock exchange.
   Ichitaro Watanabe, a dealer with Nikko Securities Co., said,
``There was substantial selling by those eager to unload holdings
that depreciated badly during the stock market debacle in the past
week.
   ``Computer-aided selling by arbitrageurs accelerated the
decline,'' he added.
   But he said a market crash was highly unlikely because the
recent decline has not been caused by panic selling.
   In arbitrage dealing, traders aided by computers spot price gaps
between different markets, for example the spot and futures markets
_ and seek to profit from them.
   Arbitrageurs today sold shares in the spot market to take
advantage of a fall in the Nikkei futures index, dealers said.
   The Nikkei index for the spot market fell 1,569.10 points on
Monday in its second-largest one-day plunge ever and its worst
since the October 1987 global crash. But it bounced back with gains
of 576.08 on Tuesday and 694.04 on Wednesday.
   After Monday's plunge, the Tokyo Stock Exchange asked 10 major
foreign and domestic securities not to file arbitrage selling
orders after trading sessions begin if the indicator is falling.
   In the currency market, dealers said the dollar's sharply higher
opening in Tokyo Thursday followed its overnight surge on overseas
markets.
   In New York, the dollar rose to 149.08 yen, up from 148.73 late
Tuesday, as traders sold the West German mark for the dollar. The
dollar's strength carried over into dollar-yen trading.
   ``The general perception in the market is that there won't be an
interest rate hike in West Germany for some time and that
encouraged the mark selling in New York,'' said a dealer with
Daiichi Kangyo Bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A trader with the Bank of Tokyo, also requesting anonymity, said
the dollar's climb is expected to continue for some time as market
players see how high they can push it.
   The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, has been
intervening in the market intermittently, selling dollars in an
attempt to support the yen. The bank does not comment on its
specific exchange market activities.
   A Bank of Japan official said, however, the bank will continue
to intervene in the market for the time being, but ``we will
consider other measures as deemed necessary'' to check the yen's
decline, Kyodo News Service reported.

   The government's case against Manuel Noriega has
been reinforced by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision granting
agents broader authority to conduct searches in foreign countries,
the lead prosecutor says.
   ``We're happy to see it come,'' U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen
said of the ruling Wednesday that U.S. authorities do not need a
warrant to search a foreign site in a case involving a non-U.S.
citizen. ``It's generally known that that's our position in the
Noriega case, and it's good news that the rules won't change.''
   Noriega contends his arrest after the Dec. 20 American invasion
was illegal, as was the U.S. seizure of evidence from homes and
offices. The ousted Panamanian dictator is accused of taking
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
   One of Noriega's attorneys, Steven Kollin, said that he had not
read the opinion but that the ruling apparently wouldn't apply
directly to Noriega's arrest. He said it might relate to material
seized by U.S. authorities.
   Yet Samuel Burstyn, attorney for Noriega co-defendant Luis del
Cid, said the ruling also could encompass the issue of illegal
arrest.
   ``This is a blow to (that) defense,'' he said.
   Burstyn also said the case seemed to undermine, in part,
previous Supreme Court rulings that authorities could not benefit
from illegal searches or arrests.
   ``The judge should punish the prosecution for doing something
illegal, but now they are refusing to do so,'' the attorney said.
   The Supreme Court decision helps in joint overseas operations
because U.S. agents will now be bound by the same law used in the
host country, Lehtinen said.
   ``We think it's important that you don't have a double set of
rules,'' Lehtinen said. ``What a contrary opinion would do is to
say their own law is not good enough for their own country.''

   Demonstrators scuffled over U.S. policy in
Central America, started a bonfire and scattered leaflets at a
hotel as President Bush spoke at a fund-raiser. At least five
people were arrested, police said.
   Later, police fired three shots in a chase of a stolen car a
half-mile from the president's motorcade, police said. Bush,
traveling to a waiting Air Force One at San Francisco Airport, was
unaware of the incident, authorities said.
   Two youths were arrested for investigation of drunken driving,
possession of a stolen vehicle and auto theft, police said. Police
had opened fire after they refused to pull over, said Highway
Patrol Sgt. Fred Bowe. No one was hurt.
   ``It was bad planning on (their) part. They definitely could
have picked a better time and place,'' Bowe said.
   About 1,000 people had gathered outside the St. Francis Hotel to
cheer Bush or protest his visit on behalf of Sen. Pete Wilson's
gubernatorial campaign.
   Riot police broke up fistfights and shoving matches between
protesters favoring Nicaragua'a lame-duck Sandinista government and
those cheering the opposition party that won Sunday's election.
   Two dozen torch-bearing protesters, some wearing bandanas on
their faces, set a bonfire, cheering wildly as the flames crept to
within two feet of a TV van. Police escorted firefighters in to put
out the flames.
   Several protesters got into the hotel and hung a pro-Sandinista
banner from a window. They hurled about 300 leaflets into the lobby
as firecrackers popped outside.

<TEXT>
   About 3 million Ethiopians could die of hunger
this year because government and rebel forces refuse to stop
fighting long enough to allow delivery of food shipments, State
Department officials say.
   The officials briefed two House subcommittees Wednesday about
efforts to arrange a cease-fire and coordinate food shipments to
starving residents of northern Ethiopia.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said the United States
had been holding high-level talks with the Soviet Union, which arms
the Ethiopian government, on the increasingly dire situation.
   The Soviet supplies, which last year amounted to $600 million,
are ``on a downward curve,'' he said, as the Kremlin extricates
itself from financial support of Third World governments and
channels resources to domestic needs.
   The Soviets have pulled half of their 2,000 military advisers
out of Ethiopia and have urged the government of Mengistu Haile
Mariam to discuss peace with the two main insurgent groups in the
provinces of Tigre and Eritrea, he said.
   But there has been no progress in the effort to get talks going
under the mediation of former President Jimmy Carter, Cohen said.
   The United States, he said, has not been ``impressed by the
commitment of either side in Ethiopia to peace and relief efforts.''
   The Ethiopian government must offer concrete proposals for a
loose federation of states that would keep the country whole yet
preserve the character of Eritrea and Tigre, he said.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front ``must accept some
measure of responsibility for the increased risk of famine and mass
starvation'' because of the offensive it launched Feb. 8 that cut
off food supplies through the port of Massawa, Cohen told the
committees.
   There are unconfirmed reports that about 45,000 tons of U.S.
food were destroyed in the offensive and subsequent government
bombing of the town, said Andrew Natsios, director of the State
Department's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance.
   Perhaps as many as 3 million people ``are now trapped by the
fighting with no access to relief food,'' he said, adding that
unless the fighting stops, ``a catastrophe of terrible proportions
will be visited upon the Ethiopian people again, comparable to
1984-85, when 1 million people died.''
   He said hundreds of thousands could die if no food reaches them
within three or four weeks.
   Cohen said support from foreign governments, such as the Soviets
and Israel, must stop.
   ``We have been very staunch in our opposition to any arms
supplies, whether from the Soviet Union, Israel, or any other
country,'' Cohen said.
   Israel, which recently re-established diplomatic ties with
Ethiopia, has assured the United States its supplies to Mengistu
are minimal, consisting of small arms and trainers, Cohen said.
   Israeli officials have denied reports that they are providing
Mengistu with cluster bombs, but concede they are helping the
government because they want Mengistu to allow more than 20,000
Jews to leave the country.
   Mengistu has been seeking to replace the declining Soviet
deliveries with weapons from North Korea, China and Brazil, said
Cohen, but so far has not been successful.
   The United States is looking to the United Nations to be more
active in organizing international relief supplies to Ethiopia,
including using airlifts and ensuring the sides hold their fire to
allow deliveries of food, he said.

<HEAD>New Japanese Talent Jumps Gun On Winter Shows</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Jun in designer's name and Auguste are correct.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big ready-to-wear winter fashion shows don't
begin until mid-March, but a new Japanese designer named Jun Inoue
jumped the gun with a low-key collection of coordinates.
   His adorable trapeze mini-coats, well-cut buttoned jodhpur
pants, beautiful fabrics and excellent cuts, displayed Wednesday,
would be good news in any collection for next winter.
   Jun Inoue, working under the name ``Jun, July, Auguste,'' is
just the latest Japanese designer trying to make it in Paris.
   Kenzo came into his own over 18 years ago, Hanae Mori turned
into a ``French'' couturiere about 20 years ago, Issey Miyake has
shown in Paris for years, and Rei Kawakubo stunned her audiences
with clothes shot full of holes for ``Comme des Garcons'' more than
a decade ago.
   Opting for a quiet show in the cellar of his small boutique near
the Louvre that will open officially next summer, Jun was modest
but hopeful for a big future in Paris and all over the world.
   ``Paris is the place to be,'' said Jun, 37. ``I've lived here 15
years, and get my inspiration here.''
   ``I thought he did a wonderful job,'' said Jean-Paul Gaultier,
for whom Jun worked eight years. The way-out wonder boy of French
fashion, Gaultier said he liked the details like a shirred
mini-dress in soft fabrics worn over a silky turtleneck undershirt.
   Inoue's small collection was smart and young in every way. He
led off with well-cut black cuffed shorts worn with a high-waisted
long jacket nipped in by a drawstring with a high waistline, the
outfit topped with a jaunty sailor's beret.
   The high waistline, often buckled at the side, was a kind of
signature for Jun's leggy look that was always paired with matching
or contrasting opaque tights _ exclusive productions for Jun _ and
little flat suede oxords.
   While the gamine mini look was young, there was a lot for women
of all ages who want a bit of originality in their closets. The
softly belted trench coats, the checked pants suits with narrow
jodhpur-style trousers buttoned up from the ankle could be worn by
almost anyone.
   Details can make or break a collection, and Jun found some
excellent touches. His mother-of-pearl buttons with a dangling
pearl to doll up dark blazers and coats are not seen anywhere else.
   One dress sure to make a hit was a camisole slip-like mini
number with a heavy eyelet embroidered decor on the top and hem,
worn with a slinky T-shirt top and contrasting tights. The same
eyelet detail on collars pepped up shortie coats with their flared
skirts.
   The fabrics were soft but warm for winter, the color
combinations autumnal and artistic. Besides navy and black, there
were touches of dusty rose or blue, ochre, khaki and aubergine or
burgundy, often worked together in appealing combinations.
   One of the real originals in the collection was a brown
velveteen dress shirred around the scoop neckline and at the waist,
worn with a silky high-necked green shirt underneath.
   For dressier moments, Jun also used chiffon to fashion fly-away
minis over matching tights, beautiful in deep blue and ochre. Other
ideas included his strict black tuxedo with narrow chino pants, the
jacket lapels made of a ribbon effect over a polka-dotted blouse.
   Whether working with taffeta or elasticized wool jersey, Jun
seemed right at home with his fabrics, showing exquisite tailoring
and cut.
   ``Jun, July, Auguste'' has Japanese backing by the Five Fox
retail group, and they hope to do well in France before starting
marketing in the United States.
   The clothes will be manufactured for the French market by
Chofflet-Style in Moulins in central France, who also make clothes
for well-known names like Paco Rabanne, Azzedine Alaia and Popy
Moreni.
   Priced around $475 to $700 for a long jacket or coat, the
clothes may sound expensive. But by high-quality luxury
ready-to-wear standards these days, they're almost a steal for
anybody who wants original touches in a fashionable wardrobe.

   A young man could face murder charges
in the death of a 5-year-old who was given 10 ounces of bourbon and
told to ``drink it like a man,'' a prosecutor says.
   Raymond Thomas Griffin II died Wednesday after his family agreed
to disconnect a life support system. He suffered seizures and went
into a coma after drinking the bourbon and beer at a party Friday
night at his home in Overman.
   Anthony Darron Jimerson, 21, of Forest Hills had been jailed on
$100,000 bail on charges of causing injury to a child, punishable
by up to 99 years in prison.
   ``It's possible that he'll be indicted on murder now that the
child has died,'' said Assistant District Attorney Gary Medlin.
   Police said Jimerson told the boy to drink the alcohol ``like a
man.''
   The boy had a blood alcohol level of .55 percent, or five times
the legal limit for driving in Texas, and suffered irreversible
brain damage, doctors said.
   The boy's father, Raymond Griffin of Myrtle Beach, S.C., was at
Tinky's deathbed, the first time he had seen his son in nearly two
years. He is separated from the boy's mother, Patricia Griffin.
   ``I used to read to him a lot and I didn't read him comic books.
I read him Time, books about leadership, books about my work in the
Army. He was going to be brilliant,'' he said.
   Police said they may seek charges against Mrs. Griffin and five
others at the party.

   The Coast Guard today used booms to try to
contain a 27,000-gallon oil spill near the Statue of Liberty that
caused black gobs to wash ashore at Coney Island in the area's
second such accident this year.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said a criminal
investigation of Wednesday's spill in the Kill Van Kull, a busy
waterway separating New Jersey from New York City's Staten Island,
had been ordered.
   The spill ``once again points out the desperate need for us ...
as a total society, to examine the way petroleum oil is shipped,
delivered and transferred,'' he said.
   The No. 6 heating oil leaked as private contractors loaded it
onto a damaged barge at an Exxon Corp. terminal here, the Coast
Guard said.
   The waterway remained closed today while Coast Guardsmen placed
booms to soak up and contain the slick. Environmentalists worried
that tides and wind could move the slick into areas of New York
Harbor where migratory waterfowl breed.
   Black oil slicks late Wednesday spanned the 3{-mile length of
the Kill Van Kull, and a sheen was spotted near the Statue of
Liberty, about five miles to the northeast. Globs of oil washed up
on Staten Island and at Coney Island, in Brooklyn.
   The oil leaked through a 12-by-6-inch hole in the barge, Coast
Guard Lt. Jeff Crawley said. State officials said the hole was
caused by a tugboat trying to position the barge, but Coast Guard
officials could not confirm that.
   Coast Guard records show the barge has been involved in at least
five other oil spills in the New York-New Jersey area since 1985
and one in December near New Haven, Conn., The Star-Ledger of
Newark reported today.
   Exxon offered to help with the cleanup but said the barge, owned
by Eklof Marine Corp. of New York, was not a company vessel. State
officials agreed that Exxon was not responsible.
   A secretary at Eklof's offices said the company had no comment.
   The spill occurred a few miles from the confluence of the Kill
Van Kull and Arthur Kill waterway, site of a Jan. 1 spill of
567,000 gallons of heating oil from an Exxon pipeline.
   Exxon was indicted by a federal grand jury Tuesday in Alaska in
the nation's worst oil spill, the March 24 grounding of the Exxon
Valdez that sent nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil gushing
into Prince William Sound.

   More than 40 firefighters worked all day
to remove the bodies of four children and three adults killed in a
fire that engulfed a house.
   The fire quickly burned out of control around before dawn
Wednesday and causd the roof and floor to fall into the basement,
making it difficult to reach the bodies, said Fire Chief Victor
Hilbert. The cause of the fire wasn't known.
   A neighbor who called the Fire Department said it was impossible
to get close enough to attempt a rescue.
   ``It was all in flames when I came out. The windows were popping

   Cold rain fell in the Southeast early today, while a cold front
dropped temperatures into the teens and single digits in the
Northeast. Much of the nation had dry weather.
   Heavy rain was expected on the West Coast on Friday and
Saturday, and snow was forecast for this weekend in the Sierra
Nevada.
   A storm system brought snow late Wednesday to Oklahoma and
Missouri. Earlier, the storm dumped about 4 inches of snow in
Wichita, Kan.
   Rainshowers extended across Arkansas and much of eastern Texas
and western Louisiana. A few thunderstorms were over south-central
Texas.
   More than an inch of rain fell Wednesday at Corpus Christi,
Texas.
   Strong winds ushered cold air into the southern Plains. High
temperatures early today were only in the 30s in much of Oklahoma
and west Texas.
   Temperatures on Wednesday remained below freezing all day in the
Great Lakes region and the Northeast.
   Temperatures climbed into the 70s in many southern regions, with
lower 80s in southern Florida and the lower Rio Grande Valley of
Texas. Temperatures also reached into the 70s and 80s in southern
Arizona and Southern California.
   The high for the nation Wednesday was 89 degrees at Borrego

   Wednesday's quake was the strongest to hit California since a
deadly tremor rocked the San Francisco Bay area Oct. 17, killing 67
people and stirring new fears of the ``Big One'' long predicted for
Southern California.
   That quake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale, far stronger than
Wednesday's quake, which seismologists estimated at 5.5 to 6.0.
   The worst recent Southern California quake struck the Whittier
area Oct. 1, 1987. It measured 5.9 and, together with a
5.3-magnitude aftershock Oct. 4, killed eight people, injured more
than 200 and caused $358 million in damage.
   The last magnitude-5 quake in the region struck Jan. 19, 1989.
Centered offshore, 30 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles, it
shattered windows in Malibu and knocked out power to 100,000
customers. One minor injury was reported.
   Other recent tremors:
   _ Last June 13, twin quakes measuring 4.5 and 4.3 struck Los
Angeles, injuring one person and causing minor damage downtown and
in suburbs to the east.
   _ Last April 27, a tremor measuring 3.5 and centered in the
Pacific Ocean nine miles west of El Segundo rattled the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.
   _ Last March 9, a quake registering 3.1 shook part of the

<TEXT>
   The major TV networks have agreed to jointly
conduct exit polls and project winners on Election Day to save
money and lessen the competitive pressure to call a race before the
polls close in the West.
   Cable News Network, which has not conducted exit polls before,
joined ABC, CBS and NBC in the consortium, to be known as Voter
Research and Surveys. The agreement was announced Wednesday.
   The organization will survey a random sampling of voters as they
leave polling places each Election Day, providing its findings on
local, state and national races to the networks and other media. It
also will project winners, based in part on the exit polls.
   Competitive pressures at times have led networks to project
winners in presidential races before polls closed in the West,
prompting complaints from voters there. Sharing projections is
intended to lessen those pressures.
   Cost-cutting spurred discussion of the consortium. The four
founders are to pay $3 million apiece for exit polls through the
1992 elections, saving each network at least $9 million.
   Critics of joint polling are concerned it will provide less
information than competing polls, which sometimes raise different
subjects and phrase questions differently. And because individual
polls can be wrong, competing surveys serve as a check on polling
accuracy, they said.
   ``I have mixed emotions,'' said Harry O'Neill, vice chairman of
the Roper Organization polling concern and president of the
National Council on Public Polls. ``Competition keeps everybody on
their toes. That would be lacking.''
   ``All polls are subject to measurement error,'' said Andrew
Kohut, former president of the Gallup Organization, now with
Princeton Survey Research Associates. ``When there are more
attempts at measuring something, you get a better sense of what the
dynamics of the issue are.''
   However, O'Neill said a single poll done very well could be more
valuable than separate ones conducted haphazardly. And other
polling experts said the joint poll could create a standard for
comparing voting trends.
   Joseph Angotti, a senior vice president for news at NBC, said
each partner in the shared exit poll would ask essentially the same
questions they would have asked in their own surveys, so no less
information would result.
   On polls serving as a check on one another, he said: ``It
boggles my mind to think that there are people who feel that two
conflicting polls, or three conflicting polls, is somehow better
for the republic than one poll.''
   Participants will continue to conduct other polls individually,
including pre-election polls on voter sentiment and general public
opinion surveys.
   Warren Mitofsky, director of the election and surveys unit of
CBS News, will direct Voter Research and Surveys, reporting to a
board of directors named by the four network partners.
   Network executives said they did not expect the U.S. Justice
Department to object to the consortium on grounds it would unfairly
limit competition, because, they said, any other news organization
can subscribe.

<HEAD>Thousands Die from Negligence in Hospitals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 7,000 hospital patients died because of
medical negligence in New York state in 1984, but only 26 doctors
were disciplined, according to a Harvard University study.
   The results of the survey released Wednesday were seized upon by
both sides of the debate over a proposal to provide no-fault
malpractice insurance.
   Although the survey involved only New York state and was
commissioned by the Legislature for its review of malpractice
reform, researchers said they expect a nationwide survey would find
similar results.
   Opponents of the no-fault policy, which has been proposed by Dr.
David Axelrod, the state health commissioner, said the figures show
the prevalence of malpractice and the need for doctors to be held
accountable for their misdeeds.
   ``How can this be no one's fault?'' asked Elaine O'Rourke,
pointing to her son, who went into a hospital for a bed-wetting
problem and came out brain-damaged and in a wheelchair. She
attended a news conference at which the findings were released.
   Axelrod said the survey's finding, that only 2 percent of
patients injured because of negligence filed malpractice lawsuits,
showed the faults in the system. A no-fault system compensate
victims without a judicial finding of negligence, making it easier
for victims to receive compensation.
   A spokesman for the Medical Society of the State of New York,
which supports Axelrod's call for reform, said the current system
is a ``grotesque failure.''
   ``It overcompensates some but tragically it fails to compensate
many, many people who are the victims of inadequate medical care,''
Gerard L. Conway said at the news conference.
   No-fault proponents believe it would protect doctors from the
increasing insurance premiums that are driving many specialists
from their fields, especially obstetrics.
   Axelrod said he believed no-fault insurance also would lessen
doctors' fears that reporting negligence by colleagues would bring
lawsuits upon themselves or their hospital.
   Doctors and hospitals are required by state law to report all
cases of possible medical misconduct. However, the state received
only 1,525 reports of possible misconduct in 1984, and only 161
came from physicians or hospitals, said Peter Slocum, a Health
Department spokesman.
   The four-year study reviewed the records of more than 30,000
patients from 51 randomly selected hospitals in New York state. The
researchers found that 1 percent of all hospital patients in the
state were treated negligently.
   It projected a total of 13,000 hospital-caused injuries that led
to deaths, and said slightly more than half of the fatal injuries
were due to negligence.
   The study noted that ``many of the deaths occurred in patients
who had greatly shortened life expectancies from their underlying
diseases.''
   The researchers stressed the findings could not be applied to
hospitals today, since most have taken steps since 1984 to improve
patient care.

   The dollar was higher against most major foreign
currencies today in calm European trading.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said the dollar is expected to continue benefiting, by
default, from weakness in the West German mark and the yen.
   The Japanese currency stumbled after the Tokyo stock market
dropped sharply today and dealers said the mark will remain weak
while the West German central bank refuses to increase interest
rates.
   ``The mark is a bit weakly,'' said a trader at a bank in
Dusseldorf. ``The costs for reunification are again in the
forefront.''
   On top of this, said Graham Leverton, senior dealer at the Bank
of America, the dollar is likely to get a boost from January's U.S.
purchasing managers' index scheduled for release later today.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1.26 yen to a closing 149.78 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 149.52 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7085 West German marks, up from 1.6955
   _1.4995 Swiss francs, up from 1.4900
   _5.7770 French francs, up from 5.7300
   _1.9015 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9070
   _1,261.50 Italian lire, up from 1,250.00
   _1.1905 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2072
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6739, compared with $1.6895 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $405.75 a troy ounce,
down from $407.90 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $406.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $406.20, down from $407.79
Wednesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.33 to close at a bid of
$405.59.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.13 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $5.10.

   The FBI recovered a 1611 edition of
Shakespeare's ``Hamlet'' worth up to $1 million and five other rare
classics that had been stolen from a University of Pennsylvania
library, police said.
   A part-time employee of the Van Pelt Library, Kathleen
Wilkerson, 33, was charged with theft Wednesday night, police said.
The FBI recovered the books Tuesday from a rare bookseller.
   The ``Hamlet'' edition, printed five years before Shakespeare's
death and eight years after the play was first published, is worth
between $500,000 and $1 million, police said.
   The other books were 1619 editions of Shakespeare's ``The
Merchant of Venice'' and ``Henry V,'' worth between $100,000 and
$250,000 each; a 1491 edition of Dante's ``Divine Comedy,'' a 1542
edition of Geoffrey Chaucer poems worth up to $10,000 and a 1776
copy of Thomas Paine's revolutionary pamphlet ``Common Sense,''
valued at $50,000-$100,000.
   Police were unable to put a value on the Dante edition.
   About 20 copies of the ``Hamlet'' edition and about 30 copies of
``The Merchant of Venice'' are believed to exist, said Elizabeth
Niemeyer, acquisitions librarian at the Folger Shakespeare Library
in Washington, D.C. Investigators and school officials said they
were unsure when the books were stolen. Patricia Renfro, assistant
director of libraries at the university, said some of the books
were found missing about 11 days ago.
   The books were spotted last Saturday at Bauman Rare Books by a
book dealer, Steven Lowentheil of Baltimore, who suspected they
were from the library, police said. On Monday, he notified
university officials and the FBI.
   The proprietor of the bookstore, Natalie Bauman, was out of town
Tuesday and Wednesday, police said.
   Wilkerson was charged with theft, receiving stolen property and
theft of library books, police said.

<HEAD>China May Not Recognize Hong Kong Residents' Foreign Passports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a statement likely to intensify the flight
from Hong Kong, China indicated today that it may not recognize
foreign passports held by Hong Kong Chinese after Britain returns
the colony in 1997.
   The statement, read by Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing,
said any Chinese citizen seeking foreign citizenship must first get
Chinese permission to ``forfeit his Chinese citizenship.''
   China regards Hong Kong as part of China, even before 1997, and
considers ethnic Chinese living there to be Chinese citizens. The
statement did not indicate the possibility of dual citizenship.
   Li also said China ``reserves the right to take appropriate
measures'' in response to Britain's decision last year to issue
British passports to 225,000 of the 5.8 million Hong Kong residents.
   Li called Britain's action a ``unilateral decision ... (to)
change the citizenship of some Hong Kong residents,'' and urged
Britain to ``refrain from this wrong practice.''
   Britain's action was intended to stem emigration from Hong Kong
by guaranteeing key civil servants the safety of British consular
protection after 1997. However, Li's statement seemed to indicate
that China reserves the right to nullify those passports.
   The effect would be to encourage the holders to emigrate to
Britain. China may be betting that Britain will take back its
passport offer now, rather than risk a massive influx of Hong Kong
residents.
   A British newspaper, The Daily Mail, said today that Britain had
won promises from seven other European and Asian countries to
follow its example and offer passports to thousands of Hong Kong
residents as a confidence-boosting measure.
   Fear of living under Communist rule has caused an estimated
1,000 Hong Kong residents to emigrate each week. Many of the
colony's ethnic Chinese residents fled there to escape Communist
rule on the mainland.
   Fears compounded after June, when the Chinese army crushed
pro-democracy protests in mainland cities. China refused to
guarantee it would not take similar action in Hong Kong, and
reserved the right to crush any ``subversive'' activities there
after 1997.
   Li refused to explain his statement, telling reporters to read
it and figure it out themselves.
   ``It takes serious attention to get a proper understanding of
this question and note it down,'' he said sarcastically in response
to questions. ``I can repeat my answer and tell my interpreter to
go even slower.''
   He then re-read the seven-sentence statement, stopping midway to
admonish his interpreter to speak ``more slowly for the benefit of
my ... friends.''
   The British Embassy in Beijing said no officials were available
today to comment.
   In January, a Chinese official involved in drafting Hong Kong's
post-1997 law, Lu Ping, said ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong with
British passports would not be treated as British citizens. At that
time, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd insisted the official
was wrong.
   Li's new statement, however, appeared to confirm Lu's comment.
   At present, ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong hold passports as
``British dependent territory citizens,'' which do not grant
British citizenship or the right to live in Britain.
   The 225,000 passports Britain plans to issue Hong Kong Chinese
would provide for full citizenship with the right to live in
Britain. It made the offer in the belief that few Chinese would
actually move to Britain, where there is strong popular resistance
to non-white immigration.
   In Hong Kong, the territory's lawmaking body today approved a
motion expressing disappointment that China's draft constitution
for Hong Kong does not include a more democratic political system.
   The Legislative Council overwhelmingly rejected a motion
deploring a Chinese-appointed committee's proposed constitution as
an ``extremely undemocratic political model.'' Supporters of the
defeated motion said greater democracy was needed to stem
emigration.
   Under the constitution, one-third of the seats in the council
will be decided by direct election in 1997, rising to one-half by
2003. The remaining seats will be chosen by interest groups and an
electoral college.

   A powerful bomb exploded today on a
passenger train stopped at a northern Indian railroad station,
killing at least five people and injuring 16, officials said.
   Mathew John, a railway safety official, said the train had
started its 780-mile journey in Amritsar in Punjab state, the
center of a violent Sikh separatist campaign.
   United News of India said authorities have not ruled out the
involvement of Sikh extremists in the blast, which occurred at
Meerut station, 35 miles north of New Delhi.
   John said: ``I refuse to hazard a guess (about the culprits'
identity) as it could have been anybody.''
   He said the bomb exploded in a sleeper coach of the Chateesgarh
Express during a scheduled stop at Meerut in Uttar Pradesh state.
   The train left four hours later for its destination, Bilaspur,
540 miles southeast of Meerut in Madhya Pradesh state.
   Sikh extremists, alleging cultural and political discrimination
by the Hindu-dominated government, have killed at least 318 people
this year in their quest for a separate nation in Punjab, a rich
farming state bordering Pakistan.

   Nelson Mandela held his first formal talks
today with exiled leaders of the African National Congress, and a
top military official expressed a willingness to meet with rival
South African military commanders.
   The talks could bring some indication of whether the black
nationalist leader, released by South Africa's white-led government
last month after 27 years in prison, will be given a formal role or
enhanced position in the ANC.
   Chris Hani, the second in command of the ANC's military wing,
told reporters that preliminary talks with President F.W. De
Klerk's government might include contact with the South African
military.
   After Mandela was freed on Feb. 11, the ANC promised to send a
delegation to South Africa for such talks though a date has not yet
been set.
   Guerrilla leaders believe any talks could not be limited to
political leaders alone and Hani said he envisioned a time when
military officers from both sides would meet to work out ``the
modalities of a cease-fire''.
   Hani and Joe Modise, the top commander of the ANC military wing
Umkonte We Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), were among 32 exiled
leaders belonging to the 35-member national executive committee who
began formal discussions with Mandela in Lusaka.
   The national executive meeting, chaired by acting president
Alfred Nzo, began with an emotional ceremony in which Mandela
raised a clenched first salute joined in the singing of the
nationalist anthem Nkosi Sikelele Afrika, or God Save Africa, in
Mandela's native Xhosa language.
   Mandela, 71, was flanked by Nzo and Joe Slovo, a ranking white
ANC official who is also the secretary-general of the South Africa
Communist Party.
   Hani said the first business meeting with Mandela since he
arrived in Zambia on Tuesday to visit ANC headquarters would focus
on a broad agenda of issues, including Mandela's role in the
organization.
   ``Already, he has brought a new dimension to our struggle. I am
sure the national executive will be more precise about the sort of
role he is going to play,'' Hani said.
   Since his release, Mandela has been given no formal position in
the ANC.
   ``The presence of Mandela in our midst is a tonic. It
strengthens all of us. We feel we are really moving forward. He is
a great leader,'' Hani said. ``We are sure the ANC will move from
strength to strength with Mandela as one of the comrades at the
helm of things.''
   No specific agenda was released for the two-day meeting at
Lusaka's Mulungushi Hall. But Hani said conferees, including former
longtime political detainee Walter Sisulu, 77, and other ANC
officials from South Africa, would discuss the lifting of a 30-year
ban on the ANC that de Klerk announced Feb. 2.
   Amid calls from church leaders in South Africa and President
Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia for the ANC to suspend its guerrilla
actions, Hani said the organization's leaders would discuss ``what
is happening in the armed struggle and a clear strategy on that ...
We will be looking at how to take forward the process of
negotiation.''
   The executive meeting is expected to select at least 10 names of
delegates it wants to hold preliminary talks with de Klerk to clear
obstacles in the way of full-scale negotiations on writing a new
constitution that gives South Africa's 28 million black majority
political rights.
   The ANC is demanding the lifting of the state of emergency, in
force since June 1986, and the the release of all political
prisoners, including those convicted of acts of violence.

   Military officials and the chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee are expressing concerns about the
Bush administration's agreement to cut American and Soviet forces
in Europe.
   The White House moved to reaffirm its support for the troop cut
plan, announced by Secretary of State James A. Baker III last month
in Ottawa, and denied one military official's statement that the
agreement is still ``being reviewed'' within the administration.
   The plan to cut troop levels, which must be ratified by the
Senate, would allow the United States to deploy 195,000 troops in
the central European zone and 30,000 troops elsewhere in Europe.
   ``I believe we are very seriously inhibiting our future
flexibility,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the armed services
panel, said at a hearing Wednesday.
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said there were also concerns
within the military, telling Nunn he understood military commanders
``would prefer to see, and I think all of us would prefer to see''
the agreement modified. He said it was being reviewed by
administration officials.
   Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force chief of staff, said the
United should get an exemption to the agreement allowing for
reinforcements beyond the 30,000 level in case of an emergency.
   White House officials said later Wednesday that modifications to
the agreement are not under consideration and the agreement Baker
negotiated with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze is not
being reviewed.
   Meanwhile, Nunn attacked President Bush for failing to exclude
military personnel from required budget cuts and then calling on
Congress to help him avert massive layoffs.
   Nunn said at the hearing that the administration played games
with the budget, indicating last year that it could handle the
reductions but then requesting a shift in funds to avoid dismissing
tens of thousands of military personnel.
   ``The administration is the one who clearly laid the bed of
thorns and is now pointing the finger at Congress, saying, `Help us
to get out of this situation,''' Nunn told reporters.
   Nunn and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the panel's ranking
Republican, said they favor granting the Defense Department the
authority to move $852 million from other accounts to personnel to
avoid the layoffs.
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said his committee would not take up the issue of
shifting the funds, thus dooming the Pentagon's request.
   Such ``reprogramming'' of funds must be approved by the House
and Senate Armed Services Committees and the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Nunn questioned the service chiefs about
why Bush did not exempt military personnel from the cuts, an option
that the president could have exercised in August under the law.
   ``The Defense Department evidently did not come down strong on
exempting personnel. If they did, they failed within the
administration,'' Nunn said during the committee hearing. ``Now ...
everybody in the administration is pointing at Congress, saying,
`Save us from what we've done, and it's your fault if you don't
save us from what we didn't do.'
   ``That's a curious position to be in,'' he said.
   Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations, said all
the service chiefs argued for exempting military personnel but were
assured by administration officials that any cuts from Gramm-Rudman
would be softened by a request to shift funds.
   Nunn said the administration shouldn't have given those
assurances based on the belief that officials could later persuade
four congressional committees to accept the transfer of funds.
   ``Somebody should have checked with the four committees because,
obviously, the House wasn't plugged into that,'' Nunn said.
   He said he hoped the fund transfer could occur, but Aspin, in an
interview later in the day, said the chances of his changing his
mind were ``zero.''
   ``You'll see a lot of wheeling and dealing, but it's not going
to work,'' Aspin said in an interview with several reporters.

<TEXT>
   Twenty-eight city employees have stopped
taking workers' compensation since officials announced a plan to
crack down on fraudulent injury claims by catching cheaters on
videotape.
   The employees began returning to work last week, city Finance
Director Ben Hayllar said Tuesday.
   Hayllar said last week that the city is watching and taping some
employees who claimed their injuries left them unable to work. Some
were seen roofing their homes and doing strenuous yard work,
Hayllar said.
   ``I'm the Ernest Angley of Pittsburgh,'' he said, referring to a
television evangelist who engages in faith healing.
   Most employees who are hurt on the job return to work as soon as
possible, but 10 to 15 percent of the city's $17 million annual
workers' compensation expense results from fraud and abuse, Hayllar
said.
   About 300 employees remain on workers' compensation, he said.

<HEAD>South Africa Reportedly Trading With Most Black African Nations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa has extensive
trade and aid ties with nearly every black African nation, despite
efforts to isolate Pretoria, according to a report today.
   Business Day newspaper said that Rusty Evans, deputy director
general of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told a meeting earlier
this week that South Africa trades with all members of the
Organization of African Unity, the main grouping of African states.
Evans told the Institute of International Affairs trade was worth
several billion dollars.
   The report cited other officials as saying the value of South
African trade to black African nations was worth about $2 billion
dollars a year.
   Many black African nations have bans on political, economic and
other ties with South Africa to protest the policies of the
white-minority government. But South African officials have said in
recent months that many black nations are ignoring the bans and
trading with Pretoria.
   Evans said South Africa is also administering scores of aid
projects in many black African nations, including agricultural,
medical and educational programs, the report said.
   He said South Africa wanted to improve relations with
neighboring black nations and the opportunity had been created by
reduction in Western European aid to Africa, the report said.
   Many Western European nations were diverting aid to East Europe,
and black African nations needed South African aid to compensate,
he was quoted as saying.

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The earthquake that shook up Southern
California was the latest reminder that the state straddles two
gigantic plates of Earth's constantly moving crust.
   ``The shaking most people felt was minor as opposed to what we
know can happen,'' Paul Flores of the California Office of
Emergency Services said of Wednesday's quake. ``Therefore people
need to take the necessary precautions to prepare in reducing
hazards at home and in the workplace.''
   California sits on the boundary between the Pacific and North
American plates, which move about two inches per year in relation
to each other, said Kate Hutton, a seismologist at the California
Institute of Technology.
   ``That motion causes strain or deformation to happen in the
crust. When something snaps under that strain, it's an
earthquake,'' she said.
   Wednesday's earthquake, considered moderate with a magnitude of
5.5 on the Richter scale, was felt from San Diego to Santa Barbara.
It caused scattered structural damage, but no serious injuries were
reported.
   Sixteen aftershocks strong enough to be felt occurred within 2{
hours of the 3:43 p.m. main shock. A 4.8 aftershock struck at 7:24
p.m.
   The Pacific plate underlies the Pacific Ocean and much of
Southern California. It is slowly grinding northwest past the North
American plate, which underlies the rest of the continent.
   The 600-mile San Andreas Fault generally is considered the
boundary between the two plates, but the plate motion also triggers
earthquakes on a complicated series of faults riddling California.
   The movement of the Pacific plate creates many parallel faults
that run northwest to southeast and include the San Andreas, the
San Jacinto and a series of offshore faults.
   Others, including the unnamed fault that caused Wednesday's
quake, run perpendicular to the plate motion, from northeast to
southwest. Those faults also are created by plate movements.
   Both types of faults are known as strike-slip faults in which
ground on one side of a fault moves horizontally past ground on the
other side.
   California's seismic map is further complicated by the fact that
as the Pacific plate slides past the North American plate, it also
presses against it.
   That compression can cause thrust faults, where ground on one
side of a fault moves vertically with respect to ground on the
other side.
   Thrust fault motion has caused several destructive earthquakes
in California in recent years, including the 1987 Whittier Narrows
quake east of Los Angeles, the 1983 Coalinga earthquake in the San
Joaquin Valley and the 1971 San Fernando earthquake that killed at
least 58 people in the Los Angeles area.
   Wednesday's strike-slip jolt occurred three miles northwest of
Upland at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, which were created
by compressive thrust motion. It was centered at least 15 miles
from any major faults, said the U.S. Geological Survey.

   Former CIA agent Frank W. Snepp III must
get permission from the agency before publishing a manuscript about
his experiences in Vietnam, a federal appeals court ruled.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Wednesday affirmed a ruling by U.S. District Judge James C.
Cacheris of Alexandria.
   Snepp, a CIA agent in Vietnam for eight years, resigned from the
agency and in 1977 published a book about his experiences called
``Decent Interval.''
   The government sued Snepp for violating an employment agreement
to submit all writings in advance to the CIA and the U.S. Supreme
Court ruled in favor of the agency in 1980.
   Snepp and the CIA subsequently have agreed on publication of 18
of his manuscripts. The latest lawsuit arose out of a disagreement
over Snepp's plans to write a script for a television miniseries on
his experiences in Vietnam.
   After prolonged negotiations, the CIA approved the script but
the television deal had fallen through. Snepp sued to place the
burden on the CIA to initiate judicial proceedings if he and the
agency could not agree on a manuscript.
   The appeals panel held that condition would alter the 1980
Supreme Court ruling.
   The three members of the appeals panel were Fourth Circuit
Judges J. Dickson Phillips Jr. and Francis D. Murnaghan Jr., and
U.S. District Judge Joseph Young of Baltimore, who was assigned to
the appeals case in a routine move to help the circuit court deal
with its workload.

<TEXT>
   Fires blazed out of control and shells
exploded in east Beirut today as renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's troops
tried to break through the lines of a rival Christian militia.
Police said 14 people were killed.
   Police reported savage street battles on the north and
northeastern edges of the militia-held residential districts of
Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa.
   The command of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia said in a
communique that it repulsed several attempts by Aoun's M-48 tanks
to smash its defenses.
   A police spokesman said Aoun's tanks, advancing behind a curtain
of heavy howitzer shelling, ``made little progress'' on the edge of
Nabaa, where the terrain is flat, but could not penetrate the
militia's defenses on the slopes of Ashrafiyeh. The spokesman, who
cannot be named in line with regulations, said Aoun's advance in
Nabaa was ``very costly. The army has many casualties, including an
officer, but we don't have details.''
   He said at least 14 people were killed and 50 wounded in the
day's battles.
   By police count, the showdown for mastery of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave has killed 708 people and wounded 1,984 since it
began Jan. 30.
   The confrontation, the fiercest among Christians in the nearly
15-year-old civil war, also has inflicted property damage estimated
at $750 million.
   Aoun's attack shattered a relative, 12-day lull in the Christian
enclave since Feb. 17, when a Christian mediation committee called
a cease-fire.
   On Wednesday, Christian religious leaders called for a full
cease-fire and the withdrawal of rival forces from the streets of
the Christian enclave before a political dialogue between Aoun and
Geagea.
   The attack by Aoun's troops ``is the general's way of saying no
to the renewal of efforts by the mediation committee to stabilize
the cease-fire,'' said a Christian source close to the mediation
committee. The source refused to be further identified.
   The pro-Geagea Voice of Lebanon radio station said its 12-story
building in Ashrafiyeh took several direct hits in Aoun's howitzer
shelling of the district. However, no casualties were reported
among its staff, who continued to operate from shell-proofed
basement studios.
   The police spokesman said Aoun's gunners were pounding
Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa from 130mm Soviet-made howitzers at the rate
of 20 shells a minute.
   At least a half dozen fires were blazing out of control in
Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa. Because of the fierce shelling, fire engines
could not leave their basement garages to combat the blazes, the
spokesman said.
   Aoun's 19,000-strong army controls the southeastern sector of
east Beirut, the eastern suburbs of Baabda, Hazmiyeh and Fayadiyeh
as well as the northwestern Metn mountains.
   Geagea's 6,000-member militia controls two-thirds of the
Christian enclave, including the two isolated pockets in east
Beirut as well as Kesrouan and Byblos provinces north of the city,
and part of Batroun province, which borders Syrian lines in north
Lebanon.
   Geagea's militia controls maritime supply lines linking its
Beirut war council headquarters with the port of Jounieh,
provincial capital of Kesrouan.
   The military source said Aoun chose a rainy and stormy day to
launch his new offensive in an apparent effort to ``benefit from
the rough sea'' to disrupt the Lebanese Forces' maritime supply
line.
   Geagea's militia had about 2,000 fighters deployed in the two
Beirut pockets. It has made use of the 12-day lull to stockpile
weapons, ammunition, medicines, food, water and fuel supplies,
according to the police spokesman.
   Aoun has rejected parliament's election last fall of President
Elias Hrawi, who has pledged to enact a peace pact. Aoun says he
opposes the peace plan because it does not require the pullout of
40,000 Syrian troops, deployed under a 1976 Arab League mandate to
keep the peace in the civil war.
   Hrawi fired Aoun as army commander, but Aoun refused to step
down.

   Greville Wynne, who spied on the Soviet Union for
Britain during the Cold War and who spent 18 months in a Moscow
prison after being caught, has died of throat cancer, hospital
officials said today. He was 71.
   Wynne died at London's Cromwell Hospital on Wednesday, the
British domestic news agency Press Association reported, quoting
unidentified close friends.
   Hospital spokesman Tony Prescott said he was admitted with ``a
well-known pre-existing condition.'' He would not elaborate.
   The wealthy businessman, who described his exploits in two
celebrated memoirs _ ``The Man From Moscow'' and ``The Man From
Odessa'' _ worked for Britain's MI6 Secret Intelligence Service. He
said he acted as the intermediary for Soviet double agent Col. Oleg
Penkovsky, a senior military intelligence officer who passed Moscow
secrets to MI6 and the CIA.
   Opposition Labor Party legislator Ted Leadbitter said of Wynne
in a statement to reporters Wednesday night: ``How many secrets has
this man taken to his grave?''
   Wynne set up his own business as an exporter of industrial
engineering products in 1950. It involved a lot of foreign travel,
including trips to Soviet bloc countries, and thus provided ideal
cover for spying.
   He was arrested during a business trip to Budapest, Hungary, in
November 1962 and taken to the Soviet Union. He was put on trial in
Moscow on May 1963 for spying and sentenced to eight years
imprisonment.
   Penkovsky, who was tried with him, was sentenced to death for
treason. But he reportedly committed suicide in a Soviet labor camp.
   Wynne served 18 months in Moscow's Lubyanka Prison. However, he
was freed in 1964 in exchange for Soviet spy Conon Molody, or
Gordon Lonsdale as he called himself in Britain.
   After his release, Wynne revealed details about his espionage
career. British officials have never officially commented on his
accounts.
   He said he first joined the British security services in 1938
and worked for them during World War II. He began working for MI6
in 1960, making contact with Penkovsky.
   In his memoirs ``A Man From Moscow'' published in 1967 and in a
later book, ``The Man From Odessa,'' Wynne revealed further details
of his spying activities.
   He described Penkovsky as possibly the West's most valuable
agent. He said Penkovsky provided him the names and photographs of
about 300 East bloc intelligence agents details of Soviet missile
sites, and an analysis of Soviet military manpower and weapon
production.
   He said the double agent also told him Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev had allowed important guidance equipment to be sent with
Soviet missiles being installed in Cuba.
   The affair developed into the 1962 Cuban missile crisis.
Khrushchev later backed off and ordered the Soviet missiles
returned to the Soviet Union after President John F. Kennedy
ordered a naval quarantine of Cuba.
   Wynne said he was subjected to severe beatings and psychological
pressure by the Soviet KGM. But he said his training with the MI6
was even worse.
   He said he was motivated by patriotism and a dislike of the
Soviet system.
   After his release from prison, he prospered as a property
developer.
   He was married twice. His first wife, Sheila, was present
throughout his Moscow trial but divorced him after his release.
They had one son.
   His second wife, whom he married in 1970, was Herma van Buren,
his constant companion, secretary and interpreter who spoke eight
languages. They separated several years ago.
   Funeral arrangements are incomplete.

<HEAD>Shamir Rules Out Palestinians From Jerusalem in Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today ruled out
the participation of Palestinians from Jerusalem in peace
negotiations, saying it would jeopardize Israel's claim to the holy
city.
   ``It's clear that whoever lives in east Jerusalem will not be
able to participate in these negotiations,'' said Shamir.
   Shamir also expressed anger at suggestions, apparently from U.S.
officials, that Israel should not settle Soviet immigrants in the
predominantly Arab sector of Jerusalem.
   ``We are very upset by some statements about the immigration of
Soviet Jewish people saying that they not be permitted to live in
East Jerusalem,'' he said.
   Shamir's hard-line remarks in an interview with The Associated
Press raised questions about the prospects of success for U.S.
efforts to start a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
   Such efforts are at a critical juncture with Shamir because he
is under pressure from the rival Labor Party to make a decision by
March 7 on whether to accept U.S. proposals for starting talks. He
is also facing a major revolt by hawks in his Likud Bloc who oppose
the negotiations.
   Shamir claimed he had support from ``80 percent or more'' of his
party. He vowed to resolve the issue and provide the Israeli
Cabinet with his final position ``in a few days or weeks.''
   Reclining in an easy chair in his office here, the 74-year-old
Israeli leader listed Jerusalem as the main stumbling block in
bringing Israeli and Palestinian teams to the table in Cairo.
   ``Jerusalem is a key question without any doubt. We will not
permit any attempt to undermine our position that Jerusalem, all of
Jerusalem, will be the united capital of the state of Israel.
Jerusalem will not be a subject for negotiations with the Arabs,''
he said.
   Israel annexed the east part of Jerusalem after capturing the
predominantly Arab sector from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
The United States and most Western countries do not recognize
Israel's claim to East Jerusalem.
   Shamir rejected the position of Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek of
the liberal Labor Party that participation of east Jerusalem Arabs
was a technical problem that did not call into question Israel's
claim to all of Jerusalem as its capital.
   ``It is naive to say that any participation of inhabitants of
East Jerusalem will not have an impact on the status of
Jerusalem,'' Shamir said. ``We will see to it that the inhabitants
of Jerusalem will not take part in this election.''
   Palestinians, who seek to make the city the capital of an
independent state, have demanded that Jerusalem's 130,000 Arabs be
allowed to participate in proposed Palestinian elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The balloting would chose representatives to negotiate an
interim self-government plan for 1.7 million Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where a 27-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli occupation has left hundreds of Arabs and about 40
Israelis dead.
   The right-wing premier indicated he was not persuaded by U.S.
proposals to get around his objections by naming to a 10-member
negotiating team some Arabs from East Jerusalem who have alternate
residences in the West Bank.
   ``It doesn't change the situation,'' said Shamir, who stressed
that the principle of safeguarding Jerusalem's status was at issue
rather than individual names being floated as possible negotiators.
   Speaking on army radio, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Shamir's Likud Bloc said U.S. officials in Washington
this week suggested to him that settling Soviet immigrants in East
Jerusalem was improper.
   In light of such comments, Netanyahu said he questioned whether
``a framework exists today to continue the peace process.''
   ``These things raise doubts regarding the basis of understanding
with the Americans,'' he said.

   Two Vietnamese deserters claimed
today that thousands of Vietnamese soldiers are in Cambodia
bolstering government forces who are besieged by guerrillas in the
northwestern provinces.
   Interviews with the deserters added to mounting evidence that
Vietnamese troops secretly stayed behind or returned after Vietnam
announced the withdrawal of its last troops in September. This
week, Vietnam and its allied government in Cambodia denied any
Vietnamese troops are in Cambodia.
   Also today, more than 2,000 guerrillas attacked positions around
the strategic town of Svay Chek in northwestern Cambodia, but
government forces responded with thousands of rounds of heavy
artillery.
   The attack occurred one day after peace talks in Jakarta,
Indonesia, broke down between the Vietnamese-installed government
and a coalition of three guerrilla groups: the communist Khmer
Rouge, the Khmer People's National Liberation Front and fighters
loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The two Vietnamese deserters were interviewed through a
translator at Boeung Trakuen, a Khmer People's Front base about 10
miles northwest of Svay Chek and near the Thai border.
   ``I left Cambodia in September, but was sent back in November,''
said Phu Long Hip, who is from Vietnam's An Veng province. ``They
told us we had to come back because we had not completed our
mission.''
   ``Mostly we are infantry troops, but Vietnamese officers also
command tanks and artillery,'' the 25-year-old deserter said.
``There are 300 men in my battalion and we are based at Kompong
Puoy, Battambang province.''
   Nguyen Yang Minh, 28, said he was stationed in Bolang district,
also in Battambang, since 1982 and stayed after the announced
withdrawal.
   Minh said he was from Vietnamese Division 330, which the
guerrillas claimed never left Cambodia but rather was integrated
with Cambodian government units.
   ``In April, we switched to Cambodian uniforms,'' he said.
   On one of Minh's arms was a tatoo which said, ``Kampuchea
8-82,'' the date he said arrived in Cambodia. On the other arm
another tatoo said, ``I have left home, but I am still close to my
mother.''
   He said he deserted because he was tired of being a soldier.
``I'd like to live anywhere in the world but Cambodia or Vietnam,''
he said.
   Commanders of the guerrillas who attacked Svay Chek today said
more than 1,000 Vietnamese soldiers were helping government forces
defend the town, including officers leading artillery and tank
units.
   ``It is 100 percent that the Vietnamese are back,'' said Gen.
Pan Thai, chief of staff of the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front. ``Everybody knows it now.''
   The guerrillas seized at least two key villages around the town
today, but retreated from them under the artillery bombardment. Two
guerrillas were killed as heavy rounds pounded a guerrilla command
post in the jungle about six miles east of Svay Chek.
   The Khmer Rouge guerrilla group had claimed capturing several
Vietnamese soldiers just days after the September withdrawal.
   Thai and Western intelligence sources say there has been a sharp
increase in recent weeks of reports of Vietnamese troops in
Battambang and Banteay Meanchey, another western province.
   ``There are numerous reports of Vietnamese troops,'' said a
Western diplomat in Bangkok, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``We have no hard proof, but the gut feeling is that there are.
There is too much evidence.''
   While attending Cambodian peace talks in Indonesia this week,
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach denied any Vietnamese
troops remained in Cambodia. A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Ho The
Lan, said the same thing at a weekly news conference in Hanoi
today, the Voice of Vietnam radio said.
   The civil war has gone on since Vietnam invaded in late 1978 to
oust the Khmer Rouge. During the Khmer Rouge's 3{-year rule,
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were killed or died of famine.

<HEAD>New York State to Double Bunk in 10 Prisons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH EDWARDSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medium-security inmates will be doubled up
in bunk beds for the first time next week in a move to relieve the
backlog of state prisoners now held in county jails, authorities
said.
   Corrections Commissioner Thomas Coughlin, long an opponent of
double bunking, announced the plan Wednesday. It affects 10 prison
dormitories, not individual cells.
   The move comes in the wake of several state prison disturbances
that guards have linked to the housing of inmates in makeshift
quarters in prison gymnasiums. Prison official say the gymnasiums
will indeed be cleared under the plan but that that is not its main
purpose.
   On Monday, prison officials will begin to house up to 90 inmates
in dormitories that have been housing 50 inmates, Coughlin said. In
all, about 2,240 inmates will be double-bunked over the next three
months.
   He said the move was necessary to comply with court orders that
require New York state to take convicted inmates out of county
jails more quickly. ``There are 1,200 convicted felons now housed
in county jails across New York who belong in state prison,''
Coughlin said.
   As of Wednesday, there were 51,853 inmates in the state's
prisons system, 21 percent more than the prisons were designed to
hold. New York's prison population has more than doubled since
1983, when Gov. Mario Cuomo took office.
   The prison guards' union, Council 82, was filing an improper
practice charge over the plan and looking at other possible forms
of litigation, said its executive director, Joseph Puma.
   ``This addition of over 40 percent to the inmate population of
dormitories, which are already at or over capacity, is an
invitation to disaster,'' he said.
   Currently, inmates in the medium-security dormitories sleep in
three rows of single beds, one row down each side of the dorm and
one down the middle. Under Coughlin's plan, bunk beds will be
installed for the two outside rows, said James Flateau, a spokesman
for the state criminal justice department. The center row of beds
will be left single for security reasons, he said.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Increased 1.8 Percent in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending increased 1.8 percent in
January, the government said today, as unseasonably warm weather
provided the biggest gain in more than a year.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $424 billion in January, up from December's 0.1
percent decline and the largest advance since a 2.3 percent gain in
December 1988.
   Total spending in December, which was the fourth coldest on
record, was revised upward from the 0.6 percent decline originally
reported last month.
   January was the warmest since the government began keeping
records 96 years ago.
   The January spending was boosted by jumps of 5.9 percent in
non-residential building and a 2.9 percent gain in residential
construction.
   Non-residential construction, which represents about 30 percent
of the total, rose to a seasonally adjusted $100.8 billion
including a 15 percent surge in industrial construction.
   Residential construction, which accounts for about 50 percent of
construction spending, totaled a seasonally adjusted $195.8 billion.
   Single-family construction was up 2.4 percent to $117.9 billion.
Apartment building was unchanged at $20.4 billion.
   The volatile government sector, on the other hand, fell 4.2
percent to $90.9 billion after rising 6.8 percent in December. It
represents the remaining 20 percent of spending.
   The total construction figure was up 0.2 percent from the level
of building a year ago.

   The City Council unanimously repealed a
decision to study the idea of distributing free cocaine and other
narcotics to drug users in treatment.
   The repeal Wednesday night followed nearly a week of criticism
from law enforcement officials and politicians, including Mayor W.
Wilson Goode, who called the study a waste of time. District
Attorney Ronald Castille said a free-drug program would violate
state and federal laws.
   Councilman John Street had proposed the study, saying he
believed the city was ``totally losing the war'' against drugs.
   Last week, without discussion, the council approved Street's
request for studies of the legal and medical implications of
treating various drug addicts with a system similar to the
methadone clinics for heroin addicts.
   After a storm of criticism, two councilmen circulated
resolutions to kill the study before Street offered his own, which
passed unanimously.

   Soldiers shot to death at least 18 Moslem
protesters today who were marching toward a prayer ground for a
pro-independence demonstration. The government said the shootings
were in self-defense.
   In another incident today in Jammu-Kashmir state, a senior state
government official, P.N. Handoo, was shot to death. Police blamed
Moslem separatists.
   Ghulam Rasool Mir, who said he was injured by the army gunfire,
said the trouble started when some soldiers passing by the
procession in trucks snatched a flag held by march leaders.
   The crowd retaliated by hurling stones, and the troops fired
into the air and then on the crowd, said Mir, who was admitted to
Soora Medical Institute in Srinagar with injuries in the head and
legs.
   In New Delhi, a government spokesman said the army opened fire
after the mob attacked one of the vehicles. ``The firing was more
in self-defense because the mob had become violent,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
   The spokesman confirmed 18 deaths in the army firing. ``The
situation is very bad, very tense,'' he said.
   Dr. Sultan Khuroo, a senior physician at the Soora institute,
put the death toll at 21. He said six people were brought to the
hospital dead and another 11 died after being admitted. Four people
died in other hospitals, and 15 were wounded, most suffering head
and chest injuries, Khuroo said.
   The shootings occurred at the Zakura Nishad crossing, six miles
from Srinagar.
   A witness who was among the injured, Abdul Gani Dar, said the
marchers had gathered from neighboring towns and were heading to
the Idgah prayer center where they planned to merge with a larger
procession, which other witnesses said numbered in the hundreds of
thousands.
   The witnesses said the second group marched from Idgah to the
U.N. Military Observers office in Srinagar chanting: ``What do we
want? Independence!''
   There have been daily protests in Srinagar for the past week
promoting the Moslem secessionist movement. With today's reported
deaths, 135 people have been killed since the government began a
crackdown on Moslem militants Jan. 20.
   Most of the victims have been Moslems killed by soldiers.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-dominated state in India, which
is mostly Hindu. Kashmir was divided between India and Pakistan
after the two countries were partitioned following the end of
British colonial rule in 1947.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with
Pakistan, but now they are demanding independence.
   Handoo, an assistant director of the state information
department, was shot as he was about to get into his car outside
his home in the state capital, Srinagar, said officials who spoke
on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>National Assembly Passes Law on Direct Election of President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hungarian people, not the
legislature, will elect the country's president under a
constitutional amendment overwhelmingly approved today by the
National Assembly.
   The Assembly voted 309-13 for the amendment, reflecting
widespread sentiment that the highest office in the country should
be filled by a candidate who has true popular support. There were
nine abstentions.
   The office of president did not exist under the Communists but
was revived last year during talks between the opposition and the
ruling Communist Party, which has since reconstituted itself into a
socialist party with democratic ideals.
   The two sides at that time revived the office by reinstating a
1946 law that gave legislators the power to elect a president.
Today's vote amended that to give the vote to the Hungarian people.
   No date has been set for the election.
   One person who has already announced he will be a candidate is
Imre Pozsgay, a reformer who was instrumental in the transformation
of his Communist party into a socialist party.
   Hungary was one of the first East bloc countries to undergo the
change from a Communist-ruled nation to a multiparty system. The
first free national elections since the Communists took power in
1947 will be held March 25.
   Also today, legislators voted to amend the education law to
permit private and church-run schools and universities for the
first time in more than four decades. The vote was 257 for the
change, with 33 opposed and 38 abstaining.
   Another motion automatically giving the representatives of
national minorities _ Gypsies, Croatians, Germans, Romanians,
Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes and Jews _ one seat each in the chamber
was approved by 279 legislators. Opposed were 20, and 34 abstained.
   The number of legislators present for the various votes varied,
accounting for the different totals.

   Atlantis' all-military crew
deployed a $500 million spy satellite early this morning and now
plans to return to Earth at midday Sunday, sources said today.
   The sources, who spoke on condition that they not be identified,
said the satellite was smoothly placed into orbit this morning and
that Atlantis is now set to land at 10:34 a.m. PST Sunday at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Because of a Pentagon-imposed news blackout on the Atlantis
mission, NASA will give no details on activities of the five-member
crew. But in a three-sentence statement released today, NASA
confirmed that the ``expected landing day'' is Sunday. The agency
did not say what time the landing would be.
   ``The (Atlantis) crew is doing well and orbiter Atlantis
continues to perform satisfactorily,'' the Mission Control
announcement concluded.
   The cargo carried into orbit by Atlantis was a 37,300-pound
satellite capable of taking super-sharp photographs and listening
in on electronic communications around the world, according to
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   NASA officials said that a news blackout about the mission means
all was well with the astronauts and that the silence was to
continue unless a serious problem occurred.
   After five postponements, Atlantis finally got the green light
to launch from Cape Canaveral, Fla., early Wednesday. As the
shuttle rocketed into space, the blue, white and red light of its
rockets was visible as far up the East Coast as Washington, D.C.
   Liftoff was delayed five times _ one short of a record for the
most shuttle launch postponements. Two delays were caused by the
commander's illness and uncertain weather, two were due to bad
weather and a one was due to a computer failure.
   Atlantis was in an orbit that sources said covers a greater area
of the world than any previous shuttle. In that orbit, the
satellite can be put in a position to observe military bases and
missile bases in northern regions of the Soviet Union, sources said.
   By covering most of the Soviet Union, the satellite would be
important in verifying Soviet compliance with arms agreements.
   The mission is expected to last 4{ days, ending with a landing
at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   Atlantis' crew is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. The
other members are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and
mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   The flight is the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth dedicated
solely to the military.

<HEAD>Japanese Say Hanford Reactor Shutdown Would Jeopardize U.S.
Partnership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japanese physicists say U.S. plans to shut
down a test reactor at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation would
violate an international agreement and jeopardize future scientific
partnerships between the two countries.
   In a letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins made public
today, officials for the Japan Atomic Energy Reserach Institute
said the administration's intention to shut down the Fast Flux Test
Facility at Richlanot help but impact negatively
efforts toward future cooperation.''
   Sigeru Mori, chairman od, Wash., ``cannf the institute's Fusion Power
Coordinating Committee, said discontinuation of FFTF would kill
Japanese tests at the facility and more than five years of
``intense international collaboration'' on solid breeder materials
for fusion blankets.
   ``It appears obvious that with the intent to shut down FFTF that
you would imply an intent to break the agreement, since no other
U.S. reactor has equivalent capabilities,'' Mori wrote in the Feb.
22 letter.
   The letter was made public today by aides to Rep. Sid Morrison,
R-Wash., whose district includes the 560-square-mile nuclear
reservation.
   FFTF, a 400-megawatt, sodium-cooled reactor, began testing fuels
and materials for new types of reactors in 1982. Scientists

<TEXT>
   Dog owners weary of lugging Bowser into the
bathtub for his Saturday night sudsing are driving to Washington's
new ``dog wash,'' where the customers exit with hair ribbons
instead of a slap on the bumper with a soggy towel.
   At Tri-State K-9 Service, which offers a sort of self-serve car
wash for canines in the southern Maryland suburbs of Washington,
D.C., it's heavy on the shampoo and flea dip and please hold the
wax.
   ``At home, it gets so messy in my bathroom,'' said Jean Burson,
who was grooming her freshly bathed Irish setter, April. ``I was
always drenched, and there was dog hair everywhere, clogging the
drain.
   ``This is not April's favorite thing of the day, but it makes it
a lot easier for me.''
   Tri-State's owner, Craig Jolly, said he opened the dog wash at
his boarding kennel and obedience training school in December for
the convenience of owners who want well-groomed pets without the
fuss of bathing them at home.
   There's no heavy lifting here. Doggie customers climb wooden
ramps that deposit them effortlessly into porcelain bathtubs
equipped with overhead hoses.
   ``I know people who've gotten a bad back from lifting their
150-pound dogs into the bath,'' Jolly says. ``A pregnant woman came
in here recently with a 120-pound Rottweiler, so she sure didn't
want to wash that dog at home.''
   The $9.99 price of the dog wash includes use of shampoos and
dips, brushes, scissors, grooming shears, nail clippers and
shoulder-harness blow dryers for the owners' use, along with
plastic aprons to keep them dry.
   Jolly also supplies spray colognes for pooches with stubborn
body odors, and keeps a glass jar full of brightly colored hair
bows to pin on poodles and other small dogs as they prance out the
door.
   Jolly got the dog wash idea from a trade magazine article about
similar facilities that opened a few years ago in Chicago, then in
California. But when business picks up in the spring, Jolly plans
to add some luxurious touches worthy of a Beverly Hills spaniel spa.
   ``I'm going to get an exercise treadmill,'' he said, ``and a
whirlpool bath for arthritic dogs. And over against that wall, I'll
set up a little dog deli with chewy bones and toys, liver treats,
dog milkshakes and beef rawhides that look like hamburgers and link
sausages.''
   Tri-State's motto is ``Dogs Are Our Only Business,'' but a woman
telephoned recently to inquire whether she could bring in her very
dirty cat for a wash.
   ``I said this is for dogs only and besides, I thought cats
washed themselves,'' said manager Arthur Hamer. ``She said she'd
call me back, and hung up.
   ``Somebody is probably going to bring in a cat or a pet rabbit
someday,'' Jolly said. ``I'll let them use the dog wash if they
want to try.''

<HEAD>Report: Marla Maples to Christen Trump's Taj Mahal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marla Maples, the alleged other woman in Donald
Trump's divorce, will come out of hiding to accompany the
billionaire at the opening of a casino hotel, a gossip columnist
reported today.
   Bringing the actress-model to the gala the first week in April
at Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, N.J., was Trump's idea,
Cindy Adams reported in the New York Post.
   Trump didn't comment to the Post except to respond, ``Use your
own imagination,'' when asked whether the appearance would be a
publicity stunt or Trump's way of presenting his purported
girlfriend to the world. In the past, he has said that he and Ms.
Maples were just good friends.
   Taj Mahal spokeswoman Karen Tuso said today that she did not
know about any plans for Ms. Maples to appear with Trump at the
casino, which is scheduled to open April 2, with a formal
ribbon-cutting three days later after a shakedown period.
   On April 4, the day Adams said the appearance of Trump and
Maples is scheduled, Trump is scheduled to be at a real estate
dinner in New York City, Ms. Tuso said.
   Trump's attorneys say he plans to divorce his wife, Ivana, under
a prenuptial agreement that entitles her to about $25 million. But
her attorneys say Mrs. Trump should receive a much bigger slice of
Trump's reported $1.7 billion fortune.
   Mrs. Trump's lawyer, Michael Kennedy, presented a letter to
Trump's attorney Wednesday claiming a December 1987 update of the
prenuptial agreement contains an important omission.
   It refers to ``separate property,'' which under New York law
means holdings held by the partners before a marriage, and makes no
reference to ``marital property,'' which means assets accumulated
during a marriage, the letter said.
   ``If he insists that Mrs. Trump has waived or released her
rights to marital property, it will be necessary for us to
undertake appropriate action on behalf of Mrs. Trump,'' Kennedy
wrote. In other words, Mrs. Trump's attorneys might try to use the
omission as the basis of a court challenge to the agreement.
   Trump's lawyers, Jay Goldberg and Stanford Lotwin, said in a
statement that the maneuver by Mrs. Trump's side was ``pathetic.''
   The Daily News reported that the 1987 agreement between Trump
and Mrs. Trump gives her the right to stay in the couple's Trump
Tower apartment as long as the marriage is in effect, but offers a
$4 million ``housing allowance'' if she leaves before the divorce
is final.

   Icy winds and heavy snow brought new misery today
to storm-battered Europe where this week's turbulent weather has
claimed 80 victims from Ireland to Greece.
   Britain, France and West Germany suffered the highest casualties
and the worst damage from uprooted trees, downed power lines,
blocked roads and flooded villages.
   Some towns along Denmark's North Sea coast were also flooded.
   The popular Swiss ski resort of Zermatt remained cut off by snow.
   Gale-whipped seas devastated the seaweed harvest off Wales,
denying Welshmen their traditional St. David's Day breakfast
delicacy of Laverbread which is made with the plant.
   Eighteen people were reported killed in Britain, 17 in France,
16 in West Germany, nine in Belgium, seven in Switzerland, six in
Italy, three in East Germany, and one apiece in Austria, Greece,
Ireland and the Netherlands.
   In Denmark, the search for a 32-year-old West German and his
6-year-old son who ventured out on a fishing trip in a small boat
Monday was called off and the two were presumed drowned.
   Winds up to 95 mph hit much of West Germany today, disrupting
rail, streetcar and automobile traffic. In Munich, schools were
closed and stretches of the Autobahn around Frankfurt were blocked
for hours, delaying thousands of people heading to work.
   Four people died, including a 48-year-old Turkish man killed
when his car swerved to avoid a falling tree, and many were
injured, West German police said.
   Prince Charles and Princess Diana interrupted a week-long skiing
holiday in Switzerland and flew to Wales in freezing rain and
driving wind to meet some of the 800 residents evacuated from the
seaside resort of Towyn after its sea wall broke.
   ``Things like this always bring out the best in the British,''
said the 41-year-old heir to the British throne after visiting
nearby Bodelwyddan Castle where 150 people had taken shelter.
   ``I saw a lot of damage and floods. It is very worrying,
particularly for the elderly people who don't want to leave their
homes,'' said the Prince of Wales.
   Snow in northern and eastern England closed roads and caused a
spate of accidents. Strong winds and exceptionally high tides
resulted in suspension of ferry services from Dover to France for
80 minutes.
   In Switzerland, authorities warned of increased avalanche risks
in many parts of the Alps due to high winds.
   French authorities reported four more deaths _ including two
firemen who were killed by an uprooted tree _ during Wednesday's
storms. Another Frenchman died today when he tried to steer his car
around a fallen tree, police said.
   President Francois Mitterrand and other officials visited two
hard-hit coastal towns in Normandy to inspect wind damage.
   In Belgium, police said two children died Wednesday night in a
house fire in Meerbeek near Brussels when firemen, blocked by trees
obstructing the road, could not reach the burning home.
   Traffic was disrupted on at least six railway lines and some
main roads in Belgium and many areas had no power, including half
of the country's largest province, Luxembourg.
   Gale-force winds, peaking at 112 mph, buffeted western and
northern Austria and claimed that country's first victim today, a
26-year-old brewery worker whose car was hit by a falling tree,
police said.

   The Bush administration would go along with
cuts to the two largest recipients of U.S. foreign aid _ Israel and
Egypt _ if it were part of a broader, across-the-board reduction in
aid to other friendly countries, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III told Congress today.
   ``We're willing to stand up and be counted'' on such a cut in
aid if Congress allowed the administration more flexibility to use
the limited money where it is most needed,'' Baker said.
   Responding to a question by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, Baker
said administration support would ``depend on whether we do it in a
non-discriminatory manner.''
   In recent travels in the Middle East, Baker said, he has not
found any significant reduction in the threat to peace. But he
added: ``At the same time, we must find a way to respond to changes
in Eastern Europe, in Panama and in Nicaragua.''
   Baker said he did not want to see a repetition of the current
year's budget crunch, in which some friendly countries that
expected U.S. aid got little or nothing because 90 percent of the
aid budget was already earmarked by Congress for certain other
recipients.
   ``We ought not to be hidebound by what's been done over the past
10 years,'' Baker said.
   His comments marked the first time the administration has
specifically said it could accept cuts to Israel and Egypt, which
get the largest slice of U.S. aid as a result of their
participation in the Camp David Middle East peace accord a decade
ago.
   Israel is receiving a total of $3 billion this year and Egypt
$2.1 billion, out of a roughly $10 billion overall budget for
bilateral aid. The administration has asked Congress for the same
amounts for both countries next year.
   Earlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
proposed cutting 5 percent from the top five aid recipients to
create more money in the budget for emerging democracies and other
needs.
   The administration denied planting the idea with Dole at the
time but expressed agreement with its goal of increased flexibility
in distributing aid money.

   Drivers at Greyhound Lines threatened a strike at
midnight against the only nationwide intercity bus company, a move
that could hurt travelers least able to afford it.
   ``You may not see a lot of three-piece-suiters feeling bad that
one aspect of public transportation has been hurt, but you will see
a whole lot more people care about it, in round numbers, than if
Amtrak closed its doors tomorrow,'' said Steve Sprague, spokesman
for the United Bus Owners of America.
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, which
represents 6,300 drivers and 3,075 office and maintenance workers,
said it would strike at midnight tonight unless talks in
Scottsdale, Ariz., produced a new contract.
   Talks involving subcommittees continued today, but union
spokesman Jeffrey Nelson said, ``We are more are more concerned
than ever that Greyhound management simply is not prepared to
negotiate in good faith, that they are not interested in attaining
a fair and equitable contract.''
   Nelson said that because the full negotiating committees are not
face to face, the talks cannot be characterized as negotiations.
The company said the chief negotiators for both sides are
discussing the main economic issues, and management objected to
characterizations of the talks as ``low-level.''
   The main issues revolve around salary, with the company offering
a first-year raise of 6.9 percent. The company says the union wants
a 33 percent increase in the first year. Nelson called this figure
misleading and false but would not supply the union's estimate.
   Greyhound drivers earned an average of $24,743 last year, the
company said.
   Greyhound said it will use drivers hired in the past two weeks
to operate a limited schedule. It plans to be back at full strength
by the end of the month. The company also said it will turn over
some routes to regional carriers.
   ``There are 500 airports and 500 train stations, but buses serve
just over 10,000 communities in the country,'' Sprague said. ``For
rural communities, it is lots of times the only lifeline
existence.''
   A decline in bus service ``will be felt unfortunately by a class
of people who really don't have alternatives, some because of price
and some because of the destination they go to is not served any
other way,'' he said.
   Greyhound figures show 26 percent of its passengers are 16 to 24
years old and 15.1 percent are over 65. Just under half have a
household income of less than $15,000 a year.
   Dallas-based Greyhound was formed three years ago by Fred G.
Currey, who led an investor group that paid $270 million to
Greyhound Corp. for its operation. Four months later, Currey's
group paid $80 million for faltering Trailways Lines Inc.
   Greyhound had 22 million passengers last year, when the company
says it earned its first profit, about $730,000 on about $1 billion
in revenue.
   Greyhound went through two strikes while a subsidiary of
Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp., the most recent a 1983 walkout that
lasted 48 days.
   In Michigan, rural Suomi College braced for a strike by
chartering two buses to give its 200 students a way home when
spring break begins Friday.
   ``We just decided we wouldn't wait to hear and have a bunch of
students stranded,'' said Debbie Lyttinen, secretary to the dean.

   Florida citrus baron Ben Hill Griffin,
listed in Forbes magazine as one of the 400 richest Americans, died
at his home today after a long illness. He was 79.
   His secretary, Donna Respress, said Griffin died early today.
She had no other details, but said services would be announced
later today.
   Forbes' October 1989 issue put him 261st on the list of wealthy
Americans, and said he was worth $390 million.
   Griffin was a Democratic member of the Florida Legislature for
12 years, serving in both the House and Senate between 1956 and
1968. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1974, losing to the
incumbent, Reubin Askew.
   Griffin studied agriculture at the University of Florida in the
early 1930s and went on to become the school's largest benefactor.
His gifts totaled $14.7 million.
   Griffin started his citrus empire in 1933, when his father gave
him 10 acres of groves as a wedding present. His company, Ben Hill
Griffin Inc., owned more than 10,000 acres of citrus groves and
85,000 acres of ranch and timberland in Central Florida.
   The Griffin family sold its packinghouses and a huge juice
processing plant to Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in 1981, which introduced
its juice under the Citrus Hill brand name.
   Doug Bournique, executive vice president of the Indian River
Citrus League, described Griffin as one who ``personifies the
citrus spirit, the citrus legacy in the state of Florida.''
   Last year, Hill resigned as president but remained as chief
executive of publicly held Alico Inc., which controls more than
175,000 acres of Florida land managed of leased for various uses,
including rock mining, oil and mineral exploration and citrus
production.
   Both companies are now headed by his son, Ben Hill Griffin III.

   Two archbishops representing the Vatican will hold
talks in the Ukraine aimed at reconciling the Catholic and Russian
Orthodox churches in the Soviet Union, Ukrainian church officials
said Thursday.
   They said the talks will begin in Lvov on March 7. Representing
the Vatican will be Archbishop Miroslav Marusyn, a Ukrainian
Catholic who is secretary of the Holy See's Congregation for
Eastern Churches, and Archbishop Stephen Sulyk, of the Ukrainian
Archdiocese of Philadelphia and metropolitan of Ukrainian Catholics
in the United States.
   A top-level Vatican delegation met in January in Moscow with
Orthodox and Catholic leaders.
   Dictator Josef Stalin suppressed the Ukrainian Catholic church,
forcing it to merge with the Russian Orthodox church in 1946. But
the Ukrainians kept the church alive by going underground and have
now been demanding both legal recognition and return of seized
property. The Russian Orthodox church has been resisting the moves.
   The Ukrainian officials in Rome said the talks were aimed at
resolving ``the practical problems connected with the normalization
of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in the Soviet Union.''

   Ethiopia appealed Thursday for 14
cargo planes and nearly 600 trucks to haul food to famine victims
in its northern provinces.
   Yilma Kassaye, the relief and rehabilitation commissioner,
estimated the cost of the airlift and trucking operation at $14
million a month, above the cost of the food.
   The United Nations estimates that 1.1 million tons of food will
be required to feed 4 million drought victims in danger of starving
in the northern provinces of Eritrea, Tigre, Wollo and Gondor in
the next six months.
   The United Nations had planned to ship most of the food through
the Red Sea port of Massawa, but it was closed last month by
renewed fighting between the government and the secessionist
Eritrean People's Liberation Front.
   Kassaye said food could be shipped to Ethiopia's only other port
at Assab, near the border with Djibouti, and trucked and flown to
the affected areas.
   The government and a second rebel group which has controlled
Tigre for nearly a year have agreed to allow church groups to
distribute food there.

   Curator Franklin Kelly is leaving the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, which has been the target of criticism over
cancellation of a controversial photography exhibition, to return
to the National Gallery of Art as research curator of American art.
   Kelly's resignation as the Corcoran's curator of collections and
senior art historian for the past 14 months will be effective March
30. He complained of increasingly heavy administrative duties at
the Corcoran, which he praised as ``a venerable and important
cultural institution.''
   Kelly, a former assistant curator of American art at the
National Gallery, will return there April 2 to focus on the
systematic cataloguing of its permanent collection of American art.
   It was Kelly, speaking on behalf of the Corcoran's staff, who
reportedly urged gallery director Christina Orr-Cahall to resign
last year amid widespread criticism of the Corcoran's cancellation
of an exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, which included
sexually explicit pictures.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall rejected Kelly's suggestion, but later
reconsidered and resigned in December to become director of the
Norton Gallery in Palm Beach, Fla.
   The Corcoran, the oldest private art gallery in Washington, is
still searching for a successor to Ms. Orr-Cahall. Her post is
being filled temporarily by Washington museum specialist David W.
Scott.
   Other high-level staff defections have included Jane Livingston,
the Corcoran's associate director and chief curator, and Bruce
Yenawine, dean of the Corcoran School of Art.

   Czechoslovak-Soviet military
exercises began in the western part of the country Thursday, the
state CTK news agency said.
   The brief dispatch gave no details beyond saying that about
5,000 Czechoslovak and 1,200 Soviet troops _ members of the central
group of Soviet forces in Czechoslovakia _ were participating.
   The exercises began four days after the historic start of a
complete Red Army pullback from Czechoslovakia. The maneuvers were
first made public in Czechoslovakia as the withdrawals began, and
the timing was possibly meant as a signal that the country remains
a dependable political ally despite the pullout and its
non-Communist leadership.
   The last of 73,500 Soviet troops is scheduled to leave in
mid-1991, marking an end to more than two decades of the Red Army's
presence. Soviet soldiers headed a partial Warsaw Pact invasion in
1968, which crushed attempts at political liberalization that
became known as the ``Prague Sping.''

<HEAD>Full Calendar Delays Trip to Japan, Visits by Irish, Egyptian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unexpectedly busy schedule for the Soviet
leadership has forced postponement of Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze's trip to Japan and visits by the leaders of Egypt and
Ireland, an official said Thursday.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, told a
news briefing the delays were due to the ``full schedule'' of
Soviet leaders, including an extraordinary session of the Congress
of People's Deputies, which was ordered this week to convene March
12.
   ``We're guilty,'' Gerasimov quipped to reporters who asked if
the postponements were a sign of shifts in Kremlin relations with
the other countries. He said the only reason for the delays was the
need to focus on domestic affairs.
   The Supreme Soviet, the nation's legislature, is considering a
set of bills designed to give force of law to many of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic and social reforms. In addition,
the Communist Party has moved up its nationwide congress,
originally scheduled for October, to mid-June.
   Shevardnadze, a member of the ruling Communist Party Politburo,
had been expected to visit Tokyo sometime in March. That trip was
designed in part to prepare for the first visit to Japan by
Gorbachev, which would be the first by any Soviet leader.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had been expected to visit
Moscow March 19, according to government sources in Cairo. Charles
Haughey, the Irish prime minister, had expressed the hope of
visiting Moscow while his country holds the revolving chairman of
the 12-nation Common Market. That expires in June.
   Gerasimov said new dates for the visits were being discussed.

<TEXT>
   In the battle over licensing of the
Seabrook nuclear plant, supporters and foes agree on one thing at
least: The decision was put off too long.
   ``I never thought it would take this long,'' said former Gov.
Meldrim Thomson, a Seabrook proponent who served from 1973 to 1979.
``If any human being could dream up anything worse, they would have
to work at it.''
   On the other side, anti-Seabrook protester Dianne Dunfey also
criticized delays in the ruling by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which today licensed the nuclear power plant to begin
producing commercial electricity.
   Barring further court maneuvering, the NRC decision sets the
stage for the 1,150-megawatt reactor to begin operating at full
power within three months. The board's decision was by a 3-0 vote
and ratified recommendations by the commission's staff and several
lower-level boards.
   The NRC is ``one of the most disreputable of all government
agencies,'' said Dunfey, a Seabrook schoolteacher, who was released
from jail last week after serving a five days for refusing to pay a
fine over a Seabrook-related sit-in.
   ``It has ignored public input,'' she said. ``It either discarded
or amended all of its own regulations any time Seabrook couldn't
meet one.''
   Asked why the licensing procedure took as long as it did, NRC
spokesman John Kopeck in Washington, said, ``There was a legal
process that it had to go through _ there were a lot of steps that
had to be taken.''
   When the plant was proposed in 1968 by Public Service Company of
New Hampshire, the cost was estimated at $978 million. That has
swelled to $6.5 billion. The utility filed for bankruptcy
protection in 1988, in part because of the costs of the plant.
   Environmentalists have been battling the utility and NRC over
Seabrook since 1976, when the Clamshell Alliance staged its first
display of civil disobedience shortly before the Aug. 5
groundbreaking. Thousands have since been arrested.
   The final step in the licensing process for the plant 40 miles
north of Boston has done little to calm the emotions that made
Seabrook a symbol of the anti-nuclear movement.
   The main sticking point to licensing has been federally mandated
evacuation plans for communities within 10 miles of the plant,
which is near popular Hampton Beach. Opponents maintain the area is
too densely populated to evacuate quickly.
   ``I think it's a disgrace,'' said Russ Arscott, a Seabrook
resident for 61 years. ``There's no way to evacuate the area. I
just hope the pipes all hold.''
   Ray Colbert moved to Hampton Beach last year knowing little
about the plant, which can be seen from his porch. He said he plans
to move to Florida in May, partly because of the reactor.
   ``I might stay if that thing wasn't so close,'' he said. But
``I've got a 5-month-old daughter. I want to get her the hell out
of here before they fire that thing up.''
   Others look forward to the day the plant finally produces
electricity.
   ``We need it,'' said Thelma Grinnell, a resident of nearby
Salisbury, Mass., for the past 25 years. ``We need something other
than fossil fuels. We're destroying the environment.''
   The evacuation zone has a population of 148,000, which swells to
a summertime peak of 247,000. The plant's operator, New Hampshire
Yankee, estimates it could take up to 10 hours to move people out
of the zone in an emergency.
   On a summer day, according to Deputy Massachusetts Attorney
General Stephen Jonas, there are more people within three miles of
the Seabrook reactor than any other reactor in the country.
   ``Anybody who's been in a traffic jam (near the plant) during
the summer knows that in a panic situation, evacuation would be
impossible,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.
   Seabrook proponents, including former Gov. John Sununu, now
White House chief of staff, say the plans will work.

   ``Eat! Eat! We must survive this war!''
Amin Daher exhorted his nervous family as exploding artillery
shells rocked his apartment in Christian east Beirut.
   His wife, Angele, wearily picked up the fork that kept slipping
from her trembling fingers and rattled against her plate with each
shell blast.
   ``May God enlighten them. May God enlighten them,'' she
murmured, picking at a lunch of lentils and rice, fried cauliflower
and eggplant and cabbage salad.
   The Dahers shared the lunch one day recently with a couple of
neighbors, spread around a table in one of their apartment's
bedrooms that has been turned into a makeshift shelter.
   Their five-story apartment building, like many built before the
civil war began in April 1975, has no basement shelter.
   Everyone flinched as shells fired by fellow Christians exploded
around their building.
   ``We have to keep going despite the grim future that awaits
us,'' Daher said. ``We should never give up.''
   The family used to climb down to share the shelter of a
neighboring building, but that has come to be increasingly
dangerous.
   Besides, Mrs. Daher has a weak heart and her husband suffers
from asthma. So the children fortified the bedroom with stone
blocks.
   The stone protects them from blast and shrapnel, but would not
save them from a direct hit. Still, it's better than nothing.
   When the shelling is heavy, the Dahers and some neighbors crowd
into the 10-foot-by-10-foot room and sleep on the floor. They have
taken the beds out to make room for everyone.
   Beside a flickering candle, a small statue of the Virgin Mary
stands atop the TV set. The set is of no other use: there is no
electricity.
   ``Life has come down to just filling our bellies. What kind of
life is this? What kind of future will my children have?'' lamented
the tall, balding Daher, 64, a retired customs officer.
   The apartment building is in the Ashrafiyeh district, which lies
on the Green Line dividing Beirut.
   The district has been continuously battered since 1975. It was
the scene of heavy fighting in the first two years of the conflict
between Christians and Moslems.
   The Syrians besieged it for 100 days in 1978, pounding it with
artillery fire. Since then, Moslem gunners and snipers routinely
have fired into the buildings, more exposed than most because
Ashrafiyeh sits atop the highest hill in Beirut.
   More than 150,000 people are estimated to have been killed in
the civil war, twice as many wounded, and another 1 million, one
fourth of the prewar population, displaced.
   In the current bloodletting, rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's troops are
battling the Lebanese Forces militia, commanded by onetime medical
student Samir Geagea, for control of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north of Beirut.
   Nearly 700 people have been killed and 2,000 wounded in the
confrontation so far.
   Ashrafiyeh is one of Geagea's two remaining strongholds in east
Beirut, which makes it a target for Aoun's artillery and tanks.
   Aoun holds the districts to the east. The Green Line hems
Ashrafiyeh in to the southeast while the Mediterranean lies to the
north.
   The Dahers live with four of their children, sons Nazih, 32, a
civil defense worker; Nadim, 28, an administrator with the Labor
Ministry; Elie, 25, who works in a boutique; and daughter Nada, 21,
a computer major.
   Their eldest son, Najib, was killed four months after the civil
war started, when he was 19. A married daughter, Maha, 30, lives in
the mountain resort of Bikfaya, which has escaped most of the
fighting.
   Nazih has been missing since the latest fighting began Jan. 30.
He was visiting friends in the port of Jounieh, north of Beirut,
when Aoun moved against Geagea.
   Aoun's troops hold the area between Jounieh and Ashrafiyeh. All
the telephone lines have been cut, so one knows if he's alive or
dead.
   ``We just don't know anything about Nazih,'' his distraught
mother whispered. ``We sent him a message over the radio that we're
all fine. I hope he heard it.''
   Nearly one-fourth of Ashrafiyeh's estimated 150,000 inhabitants
have fled to safer areas. But the Dahers have nowhere to go, no
relatives living in safer zones.
   As if Mrs. Daher, 54, didn't have enough troubles, Elie is
bed-ridden with the flu.
   ``The doctors in our area have all left. We couldn't find
vitamins for him. I hope his condition doesn't deteriorate,'' she
said as she squeezed a few shriveled oranges she found in a nearby
shop to make juice for Elie.
   The Dahers' car was hit by a mortar round the second day of the
fighting. Their kitchen took a direct hit two weeks later, but no
one was hurt.
   ``We shouldn't be sad about material losses. They can be
replaced. But human lives _ '' Mrs. Daher said, her gaze wandered
to a framed photo of her dead son on the wall of the shabby living
room.
   The Dahers, like many other Lebanese families, have learned to
adjust to the seemingly endless violence.
   ``We shave every four days and save water by using the water we
wash our clothes and the dishes with to flush the toilet,'' Elie
said.

<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating whether New York's city
council president and his wife criminally interfered with an
airline flight by throwing tantrums, a newspaper reported today.
   The incident involved a dispute with flight attendants over
whether council President Andrew Stein's wife, Lynn, was entitled
to travel in the first-class section on a flight to Puerto Rico.
   Allegations include that Mrs. Stein pushed an American Airlines
flight attendant, who fell to the floor of the airplane; that
Stein, the 45-year-old son of millionaire law journal publisher
Jerry Finkelstein, called two attendants ``servants''; and that
both Steins used obscenities, the Daily News said, quoting
unidentified sources.
   American Airlines confirmed that there was an investigation
under way but gave no details of the alleged incident.
   The Steins denied all allegations, saying the incident was the
fault of an incompetent crew. In fact, Stein said, the airline
apologized for the Jan. 19 incident and gave them six free
round-trip tickets to San Juan worth more than $3,000.
   Mary O'Neill, spokeswoman for American Airlines in Dallas, said
of the incident, ``We understand it's under investigation and we
simply cannot comment.''
   Asked who was investigating, she replied, ``We undersand it's
the FBI.''
   The News' sources said several attendants and a cockpit crew
member filed reports on the altercation and the airline forwarded
them to the FBI.
   The Steins, their two children and Stein's parents were aboard
Flight 677 en route to San Juan for a vacation. Stein said all
family members had first-class tickets, his wife's ticket having
been upgraded from economy just before boarding.
   But the News sources said Mrs. Stein had only an economy ticket,
and asked a flight attendant shortly after takeoff if she could go
talk with her husband in the first-class section.
   Sources said Mrs. Stein became abusive when an attendant asked
her for her boarding pass. Stein joined in with foul language, both
tossed personal items at attendants and Mrs. Stein pushed an
attendant to the floor, the newspaper's sources said.
   The Steins are being investigated for interference with a
flight, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in jail, and an
assault charge is being weighed against Mrs. Stein, the paper
reported.

<HEAD>King Apologizes For Remarks Against Homosexuals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Luther King III apologized today for
saying ``something may be wrong'' with homosexuals, which sparked
anger among gay rights leaders.
   King, the son of the late civil rights leader, said the legacy
of his father's life was ``the struggle to free this country of
bigotry and discrimination.'' In that light, he said he needed to
examine his own feelings about the problems faced by gays and
lesbians.
   King, a Fulton County commissioner, enraged gays on Tuesday when
he told middle school students in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that
homosexuals have a problem.
   ``Now something may be wrong in the makeup of that individual if
they happen to be that way,'' he said. ``Any man that has a desire
to be with another man has a problem, in my opinion. And that
applies to any woman who has a desire to be with another woman.''
   But today he said the statements were ``uninformed and
insensitive.''
   ``For this I extend my sincere apology to the entire community
and in particular to the gay and lesbian community, certainly which
has been hurt most by this incident,'' King said at the brief news
conference. He took no questions.
   Bill Gripp, one of several gay rights leaders who met privately
with King after the conference, said he was satisfied with the
apology.
   ``I congratulated him on his statement,'' Gripp said. ``I
couldn't have liked it more if I'd written it myself.''
   The New York-based Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
called King's remarks ``strange and upsetting,'' and the Atlanta
Gay Center requested the meeting with King to discuss the remarks.

   A senior police officer investigating an
apparent suicide Thursday discovered that the victim was his son,
authorities said.
   ``That's my son!'' Athos Epiphaniou cried out in anguish on
arriving at the scene, according to other officers.
   Epiphaniou, chief operations officer of Larnaca town police, was
summoned from his office by subordinates after neighbors reported a
man had fallen to his death from atop an eight-story building.
After the discovery, he was led away from the scene by colleagues,
said other police officers, who did not wish to be identified.
   The officer had said his 26-year-old son, Christakis, who had
been studying architecture in the United States, apparently had
been suffering from psychological problems, one of the officers
added.
   Epiphaniou said his son left home early Thursday, saying he
wanted some fresh air as he was not feeling well, the sources said.

<HEAD>CIA Director: Reversal of Radical Changes in Europe Unlikely</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William Webster said Thursday
reversing the radical changes in Eastern Europe is highly unlikely
with little chance of the Soviets regaining their domination and
the Communist Party near ruin.
   ``As these upheavals continue to gain momentum, they will be
progressively more difficult to suppress,'' Webster told the House
Armed Services Committee in an unclassified assessment of the
dramatic push toward democracy in the Eastern bloc.
   The result of these sweeping changes is a diminished Soviet
threat that significantly reduces the likelihood of an attack on
U.S. and Western European forces while increasing the length of
time it would take the Soviets to mobilize, he said.
   The CIA director said a reversal in the reforms could occur in
the Soviet Union if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is ousted but
that the Kremlin leader recently strengthened his hold on power and
his removal is unlikely.
   Hardliners in the Soviet Union face a daunting task with the
call for reforms highly popular and returning the country to the
old policies nearly impossible.
   ``Those demanding an acceleration of reform still have the upper
hand ... and many Soviet citizens are pressing for radical
change,'' Webster said.
   Traditionalists, if they succeeded Gorbachev, would have to
revive the military policies of the past as well as the costly
weapons-buying agenda, or create a new approach, said the CIA chief.
   ``Either course would be disruptive and expensive, and would
result in significantly lower readiness, at least in the short
term,'' Webster said. ``More importantly, rebuilding forces to
traditional levels would be unpopular with a populace weary of
shortages and sacrifices.''
   The Soviets' overriding concern would be solving the widespread
economic problems, not building up the military. Webster predicted
that any successor to Gorbachev would pursue arms controls pacts
with the West.
   ``It would be unlikely ... to seek a broad reversal of the
changes that have occurred in Eastern Europe, or to try to revive
the Warsaw Pact,'' he said.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, described Webster's comments as ``remarkable,'' and
suggested that this assessment puts the United States ``in kind of
a win-win situation.''
   Aspin made the comments before closing the question-and-answer
portion of the hearing to the public and news media.
   In his statement, the CIA director also raised doubts about
hardliners using the Soviet military as a police force that could
put down reform movements among the people.
   ``If faced with large and widespread unrest, they would be
severely tested,'' Webster said. ``There is no way to predict how
military commanders and troops would respond if ordered to fire on
civilians.
   ``But Soviet hardliners would remember that Romanian armed
forces ultimately refused to save the Ceausescu regime from the
wrath of its people and instead joined in toppling him,'' he said.
   Elections in the 15 Soviet republics during the next few months
will strengthen the reform effort and pressure the Kremlin to step
up the pace of change.
   Webster predicted that the Baltic States will likely work out an
amicable separation from the Soviet Union during the next few
years. But ethnic and religious problems in Central Asia and the
Caucasus will continue, and Moscow might choose to use its military
forces as it did in Azerbaijan.
   Webster acknowledged that a crackdown on reform efforts, similar
to the action China took last June in putting down the revolt in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, could occur elsewhere.
   But in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, ``it would be much
more difficult and costly for hardliners to reverse reform than it
has been in China so far.''

<HEAD>More Veterans May Quality for Benefits Under New Court Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Additional veterans may be entitled to cash
benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program for the
low-income aged, blind and disabled, the government said Thursday.
   The Social Security Administration said it was launching a
public information campaign to let veterans know about a federal
court ruling in Montana that could affect their eligibility for SSI
benefits.
   Under the ruling, the government cannot count the extra
veteran's benefits that a person receives for a spouse or children
when it determines the veteran's eligibility for SSI.
   The Supplemental Security Income program provides monthly
benefits to 4.5 million aged, blind and disabled people who have
little or no income and resources. Maximum monthly benefits this
year are $386 for an individual and $579 for a couple.
   The Social Security Administration said it was sending notices
to 28 magazines that serve veterans and has asked the Department of
Veterans Affairs to help notify people about the change.
   Veterans who think they might be eligible for SSI benefits
should contact their nearest Social Security office or call SSA's
toll-free number, 1-800-234-5772. The best times to call are
between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., when
operators are not as busy.
   Veterans who have applied for or received SSI benefits since
November 1981 should call or visit SSA to see if they are eligible
for additional benefits. Individuals who think they might be
affected by the ruling should mention the court ruling, known as
the Anderson case, when they contact Social Security.

<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano roared back to life
with two eruptions inside an hour that sent a gray sooty column
more than seven miles into the sky and dropped ash for the first
time on Anchorage.
   The volcano settled down late Wednesday and remained quiet this
morning, but tremors beneath the mountain led scientists to believe
it may erupt again soon.
   The volcano, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, painted clouds a
dark gray over Alaska's largest city, then dusted the snow-covered
city of 173,000 with abrasive ash. Another snowfall this morning
largely covered the ash.
   An Anchorage hospital handed out several hundred free masks to
people complaining of respiratory problems, and some pedestrians
wore scarves over their faces. Some flights in and out of Anchorage
were disrupted.
   A moderate eruption was registered shortly before 9 a.m. AST,
and a much stronger blast at 9:47 a.m. sent a plume 37,000 feet
into the air about an hour later, said Tom Miller of the Alaska
Volcano Observatory.
   ``It's been quiet since the last explosion,'' said John Ewert,
another spokesman from the observatory.
   He added: ``There has been a lot of earthquake activity over the
last several days. As long as this activity continues, we see an
increased level of concern for explosive activity in the near
future.''
   The 10,197-foot peak sprang back to life in mid-December after
being quiet for more than two decades and has erupted
intermittently since.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone, expressing concern that
jurors wouldn't be able to get home because of limited driving
visibility, recessed the criminal trial of Exxon Valdez skipper
Joseph Hazelwood two hours early.
   At Elmendorf Air Force base, just north of Anchorage, aircraft
were put in hangars. ``A big cloud moved over. Nothing fell out of
it. After it passed, ash started falling,'' said Sgt. Dave
Haulbrook, a base spokesman.
   A number of Delta, United and SAS flights were delayed or
diverted from Anchorage International Airport, which remained open,
said Marsha Sampson, a spokeswoman.
   Anchorage Police were issued masks and air filters for their
patrol cars.
   ``That's just for those whose cars suddenly need a filter
change, and for anyone having to work outside,'' said police
spokesman Walt Monegan.
   The Drift River Oil Terminal was evacuated as a precaution, said
Dave McDowell of the state Division of Emergency Services in nearby
Wasilla.
   Most of the oil was drained after earlier Redoubt eruptions
because of concern that flooding in the adjacent Drift River could
damage the tanks and send oil into the fish-rich Cook Inlet.
   Miller said scientists' ability to predict the mountain's
activity remains limited because of equipment damage from an
eruption last week.
   ``We still don't have our summit station,'' he said.

   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank says he is
optimistic about the future, despite the fact that the post office
is preparing to raise rates as it faces the largest dollar loss in
postal history.
   Frank said he is encouraged because productivity has increased
in recent months, the pending rate increase will improve finances
and more automation is being introduced.
   Plans for a 1991 increase in the price of sending mail,
including a 30-cent stamp for first class letters, are expected to
be announced next week.
   The Postal Service is expected to complete this fiscal year $1.6
billion in the red, Frank told the House Post Office and Civil
Service Committee.
   ``It may seem paradoxical to say so, but I can tell you that I
am more optimistic about the Postal Service now than I've been
since I came here,'' said Frank, who is just completing two years
in office.
   Frank has set a goal of having bar codes _ those rows of little
lines similar to the price codes in grocery stores _ on all mail by
1995 as part of his automation program. With the codes, the
majority of mail handling can be done by machine prior to final
delivery.
   ``We expect more changes in the Postal Service in the next five
years than in the past 200. And that's not an overstatement,''
Frank told the committee.
   Labor negotiations this summer offer a chance to increase union
cooperation in improving postal operations, Frank added.
   ``In the labor negotiations we are going to ask our employees'
representatives to show some constructive restraint,'' said Frank.
   Both wage restraint and more flexibility in scheduling are
needed to take advantage of automation, he said.
   No one working for the postal service need fear for their job,
however, he said. ``We can make all the adjustments we need to stay
competitive through attrition.''
   If first-class rates rise to 30 cents, that would mean they have
gone up more than inflation since the last hike in 1988.
   ``That's totally unacceptable to the people who pay our bills
and it's unacceptable to me,'' said Frank. ``I've set a goal of
getting to the point where our costs will be kept a full 2 percent
below inflation ...''
   The rate case will also include some lower rates for bulk mail
that can be handled by machinery, in an effort to encourage large
mailing firms to prepare the mail in a way machinery can deal with
it, he said.
   Asked about an Office of Management and Budget proposal for a
special, lower rate for government agencies, Frank said the
estimated $220 million cost of that cut would simply have to be
shifted to others who use the mail.
   The post office no longer receives any government subsidy, so it
has to cover its expenses with income and any cut in money coming
in has to be balanced by charging someone else more.
   There probably are $200 million in savings available to
government agencies if they would simply use the bulk rate
discounts available now, Frank said.
   Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., told Frank that he and other
committee members plan to oppose an administration proposal to
shift $1.3 billion in federal retirement costs to the Postal
Service.
   ``This is simoply an arbitrary grab to get some cash,'' said
Ford.

   Gen. Michel Aoun's tanks pierced the
defenses of the rival Christian militia in savage fighting Thursday
in east Beirut as the showdown entered its second month.
   Police said at least 14 people were killed and 50 wounded in
seven assaults by Aoun's American-made M-48 tanks against the urban
lines of Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   By police count, the fight for control of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave has killed 708 people and wounded 1,984 since it
broke out Jan. 30.
   A police spokesman reported minor progress by Aoun's tanks,
which advanced over nine hours across the open terrain to the edge
of the urban area of Nabaa, a pocket held by the Lebanese Forces.
   The advance shattered a 12-day lull that followed a cease-fire
called by a neutral mediation committee.
   ``The tanks are at the entrances to the narrow alleys'' of the
densely populated low-income district, the spokesman said.
   He said it would be ``extremely dangerous'' to push the tanks
into the slum-like district, where they would be easy targets for
Geagea's experienced street fighters using armor-piercing
rocket-propelled grenade launchers.
   The advance stopped at 2 p.m. after the captain commanding the
attack was killed, but the two sides maintained a fierce exchange
of howitzer and mortar shells at the rate of about 40 rounds a
minute, said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said Aoun's tanks had failed to advance along the slopes of
Ashrafiyeh, the militia's second stronghold in east Beirut. The
neighborhood spills over the highest hill in the Lebanese capital.
   A dozen fires blazed out of control in Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa.
Smoke billowed from the districts, and the fire department said its
engines were not able to leave their underground basement centers
to combat the blaze due to the intensity of the clashes.
   Christian radio stations repeatedly interrupted regular
programming to flash reports on fires in Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa and
urge fire fighters to deal with them.
   Aoun's command, in a communique, said Geagea's gunners were
pounding residential districts under the army's control from
multi-barrelled rocket launchers capable of spitting out 40
projectiles a minute.
   The communique said the militia fire also targeted Aoun's
headquarter at the shell-wrecked presidential palace in of Baabda,
east of the capital.
   Aoun's 19,000-strong army controls the southeastern sector of
east Beirut as well as Baabda, nearby Hazmiyeh and Fayadiyeh and
the Metin mountains.
   The Lebanese Forces, which has a hardcore strength of 6,000
fighters and can call up a reserve force of 30,000, controls
two-thirds of the Christian enclave, including the two pockets in
east Beirut.
   The militia's area also covers the Kesrouan hinterland north of
the capital, adjacent Byblos province and part of the Batroun
province which borders Syrian army lines.
   A mediation committee of three independent Christian figures
called a cease-fire for 1:30 p.m., but fierce shelling duels
persisted throughout the day.
   The Lebanese Forces command, in a communique, said Aoun's troops
did not achieve any significant gains.
   The communique, repeatedly broadcast by the pro-Geagea Voice of
Lebanon radio station, said the militia's defenses were ``solid and
the morale of our fighters is very high.''
   The militia has 2,000 fighters in the east Beirut pockets linked
with its main bases in Kesrouan only by maritime supply lines
because Aoun's troops control the road between the areas.
   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Aoun
chose a stormy day to launch his new offensive in an apparent
effort to ``benefit from the rough sea which reflects negatively on
the Lebanese Forces' maritime supply line.''
   The militia had made use of the 12-day lull to stockpile
weapons, ammunition, medicines, food, water and fuel supplies,
according to the police spokesman.
   The military source noted that Aoun deployed 130mm Soviet-made
howitzers in the battle Thursday instead of the army's standard
U.S.-made 155mm guns which reflected ``his bad need for
ammunition.''
   Geagea's militia captured more than 50,000 155mm howitzer shells
when they overran Aoun's depots at the Sarba garrison in Kesrouan
early in February, the source said.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's daughter has been charged
with driving without a valid license, a full day after she was in a
traffic accident, police said today. They said the failure to
ticket her earlier was an oversight and not favoritism.
   State officials said the license of the Albany Law School
graduate had expired six months ago.
   Madeline Cuomo, 25, was ticketed Wednesday night, said Albany
Police Sgt. Robert Wolfgang. She should have been issued the ticket
at the scene of the accident Tuesday night, but the officer hadn't
noticed that Ms. Cuomo's license had expired, Wolfgang said.
   ``In the confusion, it was an oversight that he did not note the
expiration of the license,'' Wolfgang said. ``When it was brought
to his attention ... he investigated further and issued the
ticket.''
   Police learned of the expired license by the New York Post,
which reported the fact in today's editions.
   Ms. Cuomo cut her lip when the car she was driving collided with
another vehicle at about 8:05 p.m. Tuesday. The driver of the other
car, 27-year-old Karen Bellamy of Buffalo, was not injured.
   Ms. Cuomo told police that the other car was backing out of a
driveway when it hit her car, but Ms. Bellamy was not ticketed.
   Driving without a license is punishable by a fine of between $50
and $200, said state Department of Motor Vehicles officials.
   Cuomo aides said the governor had no comment on the incident.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department may shrink by several
hundred thousand employees in the next three or four years as a
result of budget cuts and arms control treaties, Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said Thursday.
   Cheney, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
provided an overview of Defense Department policies in a
wide-ranging session with lawmakers.
   Cheney stood by the Bush administration's plan to cut troop
levels in Europe, allowing 195,000 U.S. troops in the European
central zone and 30,000 troops elsewhere in Europe. The troop plan
was ironed out by Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Ottawa, Canada, last week.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, on Thursday
joined Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., in criticizing the plan for failing to
give the United States enough flexibility. Air Force Secretary
Donald Rice has also questioned the plan.
   But Cheney said that ``195,000 is the administration's policy.''
The White House has also reaffirmed support for the
Baker-Shevardnadze deal.
   Cheney, meantime, said proposed language in the Conventional
Forces in Europe treaty, which the United States and the Soviet
Union hope to conclude this year, calls for a demobilization of
roughly 30,000 to 35,000 U.S. troops.
   ``That's the treaty requirement, yes, but we're probably looking
at much larger reductions on the basis of budget constraints,''
Cheney said.
   While he refused to cite hard figures, Cheney said, ``I would
speculate that over the next several years _ three or four years _
we are looking at reductions in the overalll size of the Defense
Department of several hundred thousand.''
   Cheney said the Soviets want a longer time _ five to seven years
opposed to three to five years _ to demobilize their troops because
Moscow expects difficulty repatriating their forces at home.
   He also said there may be additional U.S. troop reductions in
Korea and Japan.
   Most of the reductions in the Pentagon's 2.1 million workforce
would occur by slowing down the number of people brought into the
system, he said. But he said officials are making long-range plans
to prepare for those leaving the services, including housing and
education.
   Besides discussing manpower, Cheney pleaded with House members
to use their influence so he can channel _ or reprogram _ $852
million from procurement and research programs to the personnel
account.
   Without permission from Congress to make such a change, the
Pentagon will be forced to lay off people, freeze promotions and
take other drastic management steps, Cheney said.
   ``This is a classic example of how Congress can do serious
damage to our military capability _ long-term damage of the kind
none of us wants to see,'' Cheney said.
   The House and Senate Armed Services Committees as well as the
appropriations committees would have to approve reprogramming. Rep.
Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House panel, said he is opposed
to reprogramming.
   The budget crunch occurred because the military was included in
deficit reduction cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman act.
   On other issues, Cheney:
   _Defended the decision to send Egypt some 700 tanks that are to
be declared surplus by U.S. troops in Europe. He said the tanks
will replace aging equipment, and Israel had been consulted about
the deal.
   _Predicted tough negotiations over the future of two U.S. bases
in the Philippines.
   _Engaged in a heated discussion with Rep. Peter Kostmayer,
D-Pa., over the proposed $303 billion Pentagon budget for fiscal
1991.
   ``You're not going to get $303 billion and you don't deserve
it,'' said Kostmayer.
   At one point, Cheney objected to an interruption by Kostmayer.
``You had your chance, congressman, now it's my turn.''

<TEXT>
   Talks have broken down between the
Soviet Union and Hungary on a timetable for the withdrawal of
Soviet troops, the state MTI news agency reported Thursday.
   Hungarian Foreign Ministry State Secretary Ferenc Somogyi said
there were major differences standing in the way of an agreement,
but he did not rule out an accord in the near future.
   The delegations would report back to their governments,
according to MTI.
   In mid-February, Somogyi had said an agreement permitting the
approximately 50,000 Soviet troops to leave Hungary was likely
within a month.
   Unlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia last month reached an agreement
with the Soviet Union on the beginning of a three-stage pullback of
73,500 Soviet troops from its territory that is scheduled for
completion next year.
   Most of the Soviet troops arrived in Czechoslovakia with the
Warsaw Pact suppression of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968;
they entered Hungary to quash the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising.
   Somogyi, who did not detail his country's position, said
Hungarians insisted on the earliest possible date for the
completion of the withdrawal _ by early 1991 at the latest.
   On Tuesday, the Hungarian side had expressed optimism an
agreement would be likely by March 10.
   The was no comment from the Soviet delegation, led by Deputy
Foreign Minister Ivan Aboimov.
   The talks began Feb. 1.

   President Bush today denied reports that any
breakthrough is near on release of Americans held hostage in
Lebanon and said, ``There are no secret talks going on.''
   He told reporters that a spate of recent news reports concerning
movement in the hostage situation are ``ridiculous stories.''
   However, he said, ``I don't spend a day that I don't think about
the hostages ... I will do everything I can,'' to win their freedom.
   Bush said that when he heard the recent reports of secret
U.S.-Iranian talks in Geneva regarding the hostages, which
originated with a London-based Arab newspaper, he asked national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft to check into their veracity.
   Scowcroft reported back, ``There are no talks going on,'' Bush
said.
   His denial was in line with statements earlier this week by
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater and other
administration officials throwing cold water on reports of progress
in efforts to free the hostages.
   Moslem militants with ties to Iran are believed to be holding 18
Western hostages, including eight Americans, in Lebanon. The
longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped of a Beirut street in March
1985.
   Bush said he was open to any talks that could free the American
captives. ``I hope the hostages will be released. If I see an
opportunity for talks in private or in public about this to get
them released, I'll do it,'' he said as he left his hotel to visit
a new Los Angeles County jail.
   He said he had read of a supposed conversation he had with
French President Francois Mitterrand regarding the hostages.
``There never was such a conversation,'' he said.
   As to the most recent reports that the United States secretly
was talking with representatives of the Iranian government in
Geneva, Bush said:
   ``If I thought a talk in Geneva would result in letting people
go free, I would undertake the talks. If I thought the way to
conduct those talks was to do it quietly, I would. If I thought the
best way to get the hostages out was to publicly have talks in
Geneva, I would do that.''
   ``I will do everything I can ... to get them out of there,'' the
president said.
   He also said there were no talks ``under way that I know of''
between the United States and Syrian intermediaries.

<HEAD>Warm January Helps Boost Construction Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending rose 1.8 percent in
January, the biggest increase in more than a year, the government
said Thursday. Analysts said the warmest January on record caused
the improvement.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $424 billion in January. The gain was the largest
since a 2.3 percent advance in December 1988.
   The January increase came after a 0.1 percent decline in
December.
   It was the warmest January since the government began keeping
track of temperatures 96 years ago, while December was the fourth
coldest on record.
   ``If you average January and December, you come up with a number
more in line with what we saw in the previous four months,'' said
David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association.
   ``December was not as bad as it appeared and January is not as
good as it appears,'' he said.
   Berson said lower mortgage interest rates should produce a
slight improvement in the months ahead.
   Spending on residential building was up 2.9 percent to $195.8
billion on an annual rate in January, largely due to a 2.4 percent
gain in single-family homes. Multi-family spending was flat at
$20.4 billion. Residential spending accounts for about 50 percent
of the total.
   Non-residential construction spending was up 5.9 percent to an
annual rate of $100.8 billion, boosted in part by a 15 percent gain
in the industrial category.
   The often-volatile government sector, however, declined 4.2
percent to $490.9 billion after rising 6.8 percent in December.
Government spending represents about 20 percent of construction
spending.
   Leading the fall in that sector was a 13 percent decline in
spending on highways and streets.

   The U.S. government publicly asked the
International Monetary Fund on Thursday to sell about $1.2 billion
worth of its gold to give 11 of the world's poorest countries a
chance to catch up on their debts.
   The countries are Vietnam, Cambodia, Guayana, Honduras, Liberia,
Panama, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan and Zambia.
   All are among the 152 countries in the fund, to which the United
States is the largest contributor. The 11 have fallen behind by
nearly $4 billion in loan repayments to the fund.
   David C. Mulford, head of international affairs at the Treasury
Department, told a House panel the sales would not affect the world
gold market sine because of the arrears, which he said are growing.
   He added that the governments in arrears would have to promise
new eeconomic policies and help pay what they owe, under the fund's
supervision, before getting new help.

   One city struck by a jolting earthquake
estimated damage at $20 million today as safety inspectors across
the region began a street-by-street look at their communities'
older buildings and roads.
   Wednesday's quake measured at 5.5 on the Richter scale and
triggered rock slides, broke windows, crumbled a warehouse wall and
swayed skyscrapers as far away as Las Vegas, nearly 200 miles from
the epicenter.
   Two people suffered broken legs and one woman went into early
labor during the 3:43 p.m. temblor, said Upland Councilman Tom
McGilloway, the city's acting mayor. He did not have details on how
the injuries occurred.
   It was the strongest quake in California since the Oct. 17 one
in the San Francisco Bay area. begin. That quake, measuring 7.1,
killed 67 people and caused $7 billion in damage.
   About 25 people evacuated an apartment building to spend the
night in a Red Cross shelter, he said.
   ``It felt like somebody picked up the building and dropped it a
couple of times,'' said Police Lt. Don Manning in nearby Ontario,
about 40 miles east of Los Angeles. ``It was like we went up a
foot, then down a foot, then up again.''
   Local states of emergency were declared by city officials in
Pomona, Claremont and LaVerne, in order to begin a process that
would help them seek federal rebuilding aid if needed.
   Pomona Mayor Donna Davis made a preliminary damage estimate of
$20 million, said city fire department inspector Ron Gomez. Pomona
City Hall was closed today as workers shoveled out broken glass and
repaired other damage, Gomez said. The city of 113,000, the largest
town in the immediate vicinity of the epicenter near Upland, is
roughly 10 miles south of the epicenter.
   Michael Guerin of the state Office of Emergency Services said he
was awaiting assessments from cities in the area struck by the
quake before making a damage estimate for the whole region.
   Numerous aftershocks, including a shaker measuring 4.8 at 7:24
p.m., kept residents on edge throughout the area. The OES issued an
advisory saying equally strong or more powerful aftershocks could
occur over the next three days.
   Southern California Edison said 6,000 customers temporarily lost
electrical power. The utility said the San Onofre nuclear plant
remained in operation.
   Charlene Kennedy said she and her mother suffered cuts and
bruises when ceiling tiles and boxes of shoes fell on them in a
store in Upland.
   ``We were making our way out the door and I turned and saw a
wall of hysterical people running towards us,'' she said.
   Workers leaped out of windows and dived off a loading dock as a
20-by-70-foot wall collapsed at an auto parts warehouse in nearby
La Verne.
   ``Everything happened so fast trying to get 70 people out of the
warehouse it's amazing nobody got seriously hurt,'' said supervisor
Stan Sokolowski.
   A boulder twice the size of a car blocked a main two-lane road
through the San Gabriel Mountains. Rock slides blocked mountain
roads at several other points north of Upland.
   Cathryn Lethers, manager of a bar at Mount Baldy ski lodge, said
about 25 people were stuck there until rock slides could be cleared.
   ``I had glasses flying all over the place. Everybody just ran
inside. It was pretty scary,'' she said. ``We're all kind of
giggling about it now, thanking God that it wasn't the Big One.''
   The quake, centered five miles below the surface, ruptured a
fault running from the northeast to the southwest, said
seismologist Kate Hutton at the California Institute of Technology.
It followed a 3.6-magnitude quake at 12:37 p.m.
   The quake was felt as a fairly short jolt at the epicenter but
lasted more than 20 seconds in downtown Los Angeles, said Caltech
spokesman Hall Daily.
   The worst recent Southern California quake struck the Whittier
area Oct. 1, 1987. It measured 5.9 and, together with a
5.3-magnitude aftershock Oct. 4, killed eight people, injured more
than 200 and caused $358 million in damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage and
6 severe damage.

   President Bush today praised law enforcement
officials as ``unsung heroes'' as he toured a new 2,064-bed jail
that he said proved ``tough talk is simply not enough'' in fighting
crime.
   Bush was given a tour of the not-yet-opened Los Angeles North
County Correctional Facility by Sheriff Sherman Block, who showed
him the spartan cells in the maximum-security facility.
   The president said after his brief tour: ``I will never forget
it. It was long enough to bring anyone face to face with the
results of what institutions like this represent ... Capacity for
violence, the power of corruption, the ability to turn our back on
right and do wrong.''
   A major part of Bush's own anti-crime package is concentrated on
prison expansion.
   Addressing law-enforcement officers outside the prison, Bush
said, ``All too often you are the unsung heroes in the war on crime
and our assault on drugs.''
   Facilities like the new $131 million new jail show that ``tough
talk is simply not enough. If you're going to be tough on crime,
you've got to be tough on criminals,'' he said.
   Bush then headed to address a luncheon gathering of the
Republican Governors' Association and later was to speak at a
dinner of the California Chamber of Commerce.
   Delving into a complex matter that is the Republican Party's top
1990 political goal, Bush called Wednesday for a fair
reapportionment of congressional districts after the 1990 Census.
   Speaking at a San Francisco fund-raiser for GOP Sen. Pete
Wilson, who is running for governor of California, the president
also praised the moves toward democracy in many countries, saying,
``Many of our prayers seem to be answered; from Moscow to Managua,
change is in the air.''
   ``The world has undergone another upheaval, but this time there
is no war,'' said Bush, who spoke by telephone with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev earlier Wednesday in what was believed to be
only their third telephone conversation.
   ``In the Revolution of '89, an idea overcame armies and tanks,
and that idea is democracy,'' Bush said.
   During his four-day swing through California, Bush also is
focusing on crime and drugs, the environment and economics and
trade.
   Making California's reapportionment fair to the GOP, Bush said,
will require electing Wilson governor so he can block the
Democratic-controlled state Legislature from repeating the district
boundary map it drew in the early 1980s.
   ``This is bigger than party politics,'' Bush said at the Wilson
fund-raiser in San Francisco before he flew to Los Angeles
Wednesday night. ``Gerrymandering violates the spirit of one man,
one vote.''
   The president said that in the 1981 California redistricting,
``lines were drawn _ crazy, twisted lines, that cut across
communities, towns and even streets, without the slightest regard
for the will of the people.''
   Bush promised: ``Republicans do not seek revenge. We don't seek
a gerrymander of our own.''
   The Census could give California about six additional seats in
Congress, based on its population growth.
   Reapportionment is of vital importance to both parties and the
avowed top 1990 election goal of Republican National Committee
Chairman Lee Atwater. But surveys so far show that voters have
little interest in the issue.
   Bush gave an upbeat characterization of his conversation with
Gorbachev, vowing to continue such consultations to discuss
differences.
   ``Reason and calmness have replaced rhetoric,'' he said.
   On Friday, Bush heads to Palm Springs where he will meet with
Japan's Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu, on another matter of keen
interest to Californians _ fair trade.
   Wilson has no primary opponent of note and through 1989 amassed
$8.25 million for his campaign, compared with $4.6 million raised
by state Attorney Gen. John Van de Kamp and $2.29 million by former
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, the two Democrats vying to
run against Wilson.
   Bush called Wilson a champion for crime victims, the
environment, and a sound economy.
   While lauding Wilson's record on protecting wilderness and
wildlife preserves, Bush did not mention the prickly issue of
offshore oil, on which he and Wilson differ. Bush, a onetime Texas
oilman who generally is sympathetic to the industry view, is
withholding judgment and reviewing a study on whetherhe

   Personal income rose 0.8 percent in January
despite a new tax bite from Social Security, the government said
Thursday. The report also showed consumer spending climbed a
narrower 0.6 percent, a pace which analysts attributed to caution
in the face of mounting inflation.
   The Commerce Department said personal income ran at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $4.60 trillion last month, after gaining
0.5 percent in December.
   Several factors affected the January income increase, including
cost-of-living increases in Social Security and other federal
benefits, and a 3.6 percent pay raise for federal workers.
   Those increases were offset by an increase in taxes withheld for
Social Security, as well as a reduction in farm subsidy payments.
   Excluding these special factors, the deparment said, personal
income increased 0.5 percent, the department said.
   Analysts cited the 1.1 percent increase in consumer prices in
January for the slowdown in consumer spending, from a 1 percent
gain in December to 0.6 percent in January, or an annual rate of
$3.60 trillion.
   ``Consumers behaved fairly cautiously in January, probably
because they had to pay so much for energy and food that they
didn't have that much to spend on other items,'' said Michael K.
Evans, head of Evans Economics, Inc.
   The Labor Department said food and energy costs, driven up by
the effects of the fourth coldest December on record, accounted for
60 percent of the jump in the January Consumer Price Index.
   ``Once food and energy prices settle down, consumer spending
will pick up,'' Evans said.
   Personal consumption, which includes everything except interest
payments on debt, totaled $19.9 billion _ down from $36.7 billion
in December.
   But purchases of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to
last more than three years _ rose $24.3 billion. Analysts said this
spending was spurred in part by automobile sales incentives.
   Non-durable purchases were up $2.5 billion while spending on
services fell $6.8 billion.
   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health
because it represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
edged up $16.2 billion in January after gaining $16.8 billion in
December.
   Americans' incomes after taxes rose 0.9 percent, the department
said, up from December's 0.4 percent gain. That category,
incidentally, doesn't count Social Security withholding as a tax _
the department, instead, treats it as a ``contribution,'' just as
it does other retirement program costs.
   The personal savings rate, as measured against disposable
income, advanced 5.9 percent compared to a 5.5 percent rate a month
earlier.

   Fatima Sufarin wept quietly
Thursday as she searched the rubble of what had been her home for
the past 41 years.
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do now,'' said Mrs. Sufarin, a
70-year-old Palestinian who was displaced for the second time in
her life when soldiers blew up her two-story house Wednesday.
   The six-room house was demolished to punish the family for the
alleged crimes of Mrs. Sufarin's 25-year-old son Imad, who is
accused of throwing a firebomb that wounded an Israeli soldier.
Family members say Imad, who is awaiting trial, is innocent.
   According to the army, more than 450 houses have been destroyed
or sealed in thinistas totaled $300,000.
   According to Ramirez, no funds were received from the Mexican
government or the ruling PRI party. The information obtained by
U.S. officials indicated the contributions came from the PRI. The
initial report of the donation appeared in Newsday.
   While expressing irritation over the Mexican contribution, the
officials said it was not clear whether President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari was aware of it.
   The purported donation, which included cash, T-shirts, posters
and other items, was consistent with the support Mexico
historically has provided to the Sandinista government.
   Among hemispheric governments, Mexico was one of the most
vigorously opposed to the Reagan era policy of supporting the
Nicaraguan Contras.
   For years, radicals within Mexico's ruling party have acquiesced
in the its generally conservative domestic policies. But these
forces have played the dominant role in foreign policy and this
produced deep mutual mistrust between Mexico and the United States
during the Reagan administration.
   Relations appear to have improved since Presidents Salinas and
Bush were inaugurated a few weeks apart a little over a year ago.
   Mexico has found Bush's more moderate policies more tolerable
than Reagan's, while the United States, in turn, has given Salinas
high marks for his efforts at curbing drug smuggling and in
restoring the country's economic health.

   Humorist Andy Rooney was reinstated today on
CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' He said he'll be on Sunday's show with a
commentary on the issues involved in his suspension on Feb. 8.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Rooney, whom CBS News president David
Burke had suspended without pay after a gay magazine quoted him as
saying blacks had ``watered down their genes,'' a comment Rooney
denies making. Originally, the suspension was to be for three
months, but the lifting of the suspension had been widely expected
in recent days.
   Rooney said ``I think it was a very difficult thing'' for Burke
to decide to reinstate him early, praising the news division
president. Burke never has specifically said why he suspended the
71-year-old commentator.
   Late last year, Rooney drew fire from gay and lesbian groups for
saying in a Dec. 28 CBS special that ``homosexual unions'' are
among things that cause ``self-induced'' deaths.
   Asked today if he were bitter about his suspension, Rooney was
philosophical.
   ``Well, we all get the bittersweet in our lives,'' he said,
adding that he likes a quotation attributed to ABC News anchor Sam
Donaldson: ``Only the amateurs stay mad.''
   While not directly criticizing Rooney's early reinstatement, the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation complained that he
``has yet to make amends with the gay and lesbian community
regarding the series of homophobic comments he made in the last few
months.''
   The New York-based group had complained to CBS about Rooney's
remark on his December show. Its statement today also alluded to a
letter in which Rooney said he found the idea of male homosexuality
``repugnant.''
   The letter was sent to The Advocate. It appeared along with the
gay magazine's article that had in it the controversial quote
attributed to Rooney.
   In a statement announcing Rooney's reinstatement, Burke did not
say why he had lifted the suspension early. After the two met last
week, there were reports that Rooney would be back perhaps as early
as this Sunday.
   In his statement, Burke alluded to the controversy over his
suspension of Rooney, saying he and Rooney had discussed the events
that led to his suspension ``as well as the debate that has ensued
over the past month.''
   ``Painful though these events have been, we have all learned a
great deal about how sensitive and fragile our society is _ how
thoughts and words can be misunderstood, how deeply people in
groups can be hurt if great care is not taken in public discourse.''
   He said Rooney ``has consistently stated publicly that he is not
a man who holds prejudice in his heart and mind towards any group
in our society. Those of us who know him and work with him know two
things _ first, that is true, and second, it is time that Andy
returned to his proper place on `60 Minutes.'''
   Since his suspension began, CBS has gotten more than 5,000 calls
from viewers, virtually all supporting him.
   During his three weeks away from ``60 Minutes,'' the program,
while still top-rated, has slipped in the ratings, dropping to 18th
last Sunday, when it was beaten by a one-time rerun of ABC's hit
``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   However, research experts at all three networks have discounted
Rooney's absence as a significant factor on the show's ratings drop.
   Don Hewitt, executive producer of ``60 Minutes,'' praised
Burke's decision to put Rooney back to work early, saying it showed
Burke knows the difference ``between what's right and what's
expedient.''
   Rooney's segment on ``60 Minutes'' usually runs about three
minutes. Hewitt, asked how much time he planned to give Rooney this
Sunday, replied, ``Whatever he wants.'' He laughed and added:
   ``What do you say to a 2,000-pound gorilla?''

<HEAD>Senate Leaders and White House Reach Agreement on Clean Air Bill.</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 15-19, Among the, with details on provisions.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Senate leaders and the Bush administration
reached agreement today on a compromise clean air bill providing
tighter controls on emissions from automobiles, electric power
plants and factories.
   Republican and Democratic leaders as well as the White House
promised to work for passage of the agreement when the measure
comes up for debate on the Senate floor next week.
   The agreement, the product of three weeks of closed-door
negotiations, reflects a middle ground between air pollution
controls required by a sweeping bill that cleared a Senate
committee last November and the more cautious and less expensive
approach advocated by the administration.
   One aim of the compromise was to defuse the prospect of a
filibuster which had been threatened by a group of Midwest senators
concerned about the cost of complying with the acid rain provision.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called it a
``sound and comprehensive'' proposal and said he hoped it would
avoid any filibuster.
   Negotiators hoped the compromise would attract enough support so
any filibuster attempt would be defeated.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, said he would work
to advance the compromise legislation, but urged Mitchell ``not to
handcuff anyone'' during the upcoming floor action by rushing to
impose a petition to cut off debate on the matter.
   ``This is a giant step forward,'' Dole said of the compromise.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who has voiced concern about the
effect of stringent acid rain controls on his state's coal miners,
said he would seek additional changes to the bill. But he said,
``I'm not going to engage in any filibuster.''
   One element of the compromise would allow electric utilities in
the Midwest to acquire credits for any pollution reduction. These
credits could be sold to other utilities and in part offset the
cost of pollution controls.
   The breakthrough on the compromise came Wednesday when Senate
leaders and the White House agreed to tighter controls on
automobile emissions to deal with urban smog and on steps aimed at
easing concerns of the Midwest senators over the high costs of
controlling acid rain pollutants.
   President Bush, traveling in California, praised the agreement
as a ``big forward step'' and called on the Senate to move quickly
on it.
   The White House, during three weeks of closed-door negotiations,
had adamantly opposed a second round of automobile tailpipe
controls included in the Senate bill. At the same time, the bill's
key sponsors, including Mitchell, argued that the two-stage
controls were needed to reduce smog in some of nation's most
polluted urban centers.
   Under a compromise agreement worked out Wednesday, the second
round of tailpipe controls, known as Tier 2, would go into effect
only if 11 of 27 cities considered to have ``serious'' air
pollution problems fail to make enough progress in meeting federal
air quality standards by late in this decade.
   Among the provisions of the compromise:
   _ Industrial plants would have to use the best available
technology to curb releases of 192 toxic chemicals, including
carcinogens, and early in the next decade comply with a specific
``health standard'' to limit risks to people closest to industrial
plants.
   _ Under the acid rain provision, electric utility plants will
have to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons.
Some provisons were included to ease Midwest concerns about high
cost of emission controls and concerns from the West that the curbs
might inhibit growth.
   _ Tougher tailpipe emission controls on automobiles would reduce
smog-causing pollutants by 22 to 60 percent, depending on the
pollutant. A second round of emission curbs would go into effect if
at least a dozen of 27 communities with ``serious'' pollution
problems failed to achieve federal air quality standards.
   _ A broad range of industries and businesses would have to
comply with tougher controls on smog-causing emissions. The
compromise, however, would exempt thousands of smaller polluters,
which would have been covered by the original Senate bill.
   ``This agreement is environmentally sound and strong,'' said
White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said the provisions ``will achieve significant and permanent
reductions in pollutants that cause acid rain, will ensure annual
improvements to bring our nation's cities into compliance with
standards relating to urban smog and carbon monoxide, and will
greatly reduce the risk to the public's health from toxic
emissions.''
   ``By incorporating flexibility and innovation in its approach to
achieving pollution reductions, it will allow environmental and
health standards to be met in a way that creates maximum choice for
both states and regulated industries and places fewer burdens on
consumers. It will thus improve the Clean Air Act in a way that
promotes both a healthy environment and a sound economy,''
Fitzwater said.
   The compromise was criticized by environmentalists.
   ``You could have cities with a total of 80 million people not in
(federal air quality) attainment and still not have a Tier 2,''
said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, an environmental group.
   The Senate leaders and the White House agreed to require utility
plants to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons a year
by the end of the decade.
   The talks earlier this week produced tentative agreements on how
to control toxic chemicals from industrial plants and on curbing
smog-causing pollutants from sources from chemical plants to dry
cleaners.
   A different clean air bill remains in a House committee. House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Wednesday he hoped that bill
could come up for floor consideration by April, several months
earlier than he previously indicated.

<TEXT>
   Smokey Robinson and Sheena Easton told heartfelt
tales of their own disadvantaged backgrounds Thursday as the pop
stars helped launch a five-year, $40 million literacy campaign
sponsored by Coors Brewing Co.
   A key feature of the campaign, also sponsored by MCA Music
Entertainment Group and several grassroots literacy organizations,
will be a spring concert tour called ``Pass It On'' that will use
music to promote the cause of literacy.
   Robinson and Easton will be among the artists taking part in the
tour. Cities and dates will be announced later.
   ``Coors has a long history of being involved in issues important
in this country,'' Peter Coors, president of the Golden,
Colo.-based brewery, told a news conference.
   He added that Coors, like other companies, had come to realize
that it was in its self-interest to promote literacy because ``if
trends continue, in the year 2000 we'd be hard-pressed to find
qualified job applicants.''
   The $40 million effort is among the largest corporate
commitments ever in the literacy field.
   It will include $250,000 awards in 1990 to three literacy groups
named as co-sponsors of the ``Pass It On'' campaign: SER-Jobs for
Progress, a Dallas-based organization aimed at the Hispanic
community; the Philadelphia-based Opportunities Industrialization
Centers of America; and the National Volunteer Literacy Campaign.
   Those groups will work together as the ``Coors Literacy Corps,''
committed to training 30,000 adults to read in 1990.
   Much of the rest of the money will be spent on promoting the
concert tour and on a campaign to increase awareness of illiteracy,
Coors said. The campaign will urge non-readers to seek help, and
will have a toll-free literacy referral and information telephone
line (1-800-228-8813).
   Easton recalled her childhood in a blue collar foundry town in
Scotland and how her mother instilled in her a love of reading at
an early age:
   ``When things would get really crazy in the house, my mother
would always pick up a magazine or a book and say, `Just give me
ten minutes.' I learned from my mother that books hold a magic, a
way to escape. I'll always thank her. I didn't want to leave school
and work in a factory. My mother gave me the window to the world:
books.''
   With her mother's encouragement, she went on to college and was
preparing for teaching _ until her career took a decidedly
different turn.
   Robinson, who grew up in a family of 10 in a Detroit housing
project, credited his father, a self-taught reader with only a
fourth-grade education, with instilling in him a love of learning
and an ambition for better things.
   ``In my particular neighborhood,'' Robinson said, ``the odds
against my making something of my life were enormous.''

<TEXT>
   The government halted an investigation of
alleged fraud by Northrop Corp. in the MX missile program when the
company agreed to plead guilty in another case, the corporation
says.
   A memo to employees of the corporation Wednesday said that
prosecutors agreed to halt the probe into alleged falsification of
MX test data, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   Northrop remains the target other probes, including allegations
of political payoffs in South Korea and allegations that it
defrauded the government by more than $20 billion on the B-2
stealth bomber program, the Times said. Northrop had said the FBI
conducted a raid recently at a Northrop B-2 parts factory in
connection with the B-2 case.
   Other investigations of less significant wrongdoing on the B-2
program were dropped as part of the agreement with prosecutors, the
Los Angeles Times reported.
   The memo from Northrop president Kent Kresa, copies of which
were obtained by various newspapers, said the company was barred
from telling reporters which investigations were halted but was
free to inform employees and investors.
   ``Some other legal issues remain open,'' Kresa wrote. ``We
intend to deal with them and to resolve them satisfactorily through
legal channels.''
   Justice Department officials could not be reached late Wednesday
to comment on the memo. Northrop executives declined to comment.
   Northrop pleaded guilty Tuesday to 34 charges of making false
statements to the government and agreed to a $17 million fine. The
company admitted falsifying test data on parts for the cruise
missile and Harrier attack jet.
   In exchange, the government agreed to drop 141 counts.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William F. Fahey called the agreement
``a very significant victory in our efforts to combat defense
contracting fraud and misconduct.''
   But Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce Committee's panel on oversight and investigations,
termed the plea bargain ``stealth justice.''
   ``This leaves the public and the Congress without the vaguest
idea of the rascality Northrop was engaged in or its cost to the
public,'' Dingell said.

<TEXT>
   Joseph Hazelwood's apparent efforts to
pull his grounded tanker off a reef did not do additional damage to
the crippled ship, a former tanker captain testified today.
   But Robert Beevers said that by all normal indications, such a
maneuver would have torn away additional portions of the gashed
underbelly of the 987-foot Exxon Valdez.
   The witness did not explain why the ship suffered no additional
damage, but he said he was certain Hazelwood was trying to
extricate it, not stabilize it on the reef.
   ``I have no reason to think that Captain Hazelwood would lie to
the Coast Guard,'' Beevers said. ``I don't think he would tell them
anything he didn't intend to do.''
   Hazelwood, in his first radio conversation after the ship hit
Bligh Reef, said he was trying to extricate it.
   Under cross-examination by Hazelwood's attorneys, Beevers
continued to maintain that Hazelwood should have remained on the
bridge of the tanker during its final passage into Prince William
Sound.
   Chunks of glacial ice forced two tankers to change course only a
few hours before Hazelwood tried a similar maneuver last March 24.
   Still another ship preceded the Exxon Valdez into Prince William
Sound on March 23 without anyone on board certified to pilot in
that area, Beevers acknowledged.
   On Wednesday, Beevers' testimony was stopped by the eruption of
Redoubt Volcano, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage. Superior Court
Judge Karl Johnstone sent jurors home early to avoid exposure to
falling ash, the first time fallout from the volcano has hit the
state's largest city.
   Hazelwood, 43, was the only skipper whose ship hit Bligh Reef.
The tanker spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska crude,
killing countless birds, fish and other wildlife and tarring
hundreds of miles of rocky shore in the nation's worst oil spill.
   The seaman from Huntington, N.Y., is charged with criminal
mischief, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted, he could
get 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Before court was recessed Wednesday, defense attorney Dick
Madson had been grilling the retired captain, who earlier accused
Hazelwood of reckless actions.
   ``Do you recall the course of the Arco Juneau?'' Madson asked,
referring to a tanker that left Valdez two hours before the Exxon
ship.
   ``Yes,'' said Beevers. ``They went around the ice and cleared
Bligh Reef.''
   Asked how close the ship came to hitting the reef, he referred
to charts and said about five-tenths of a mile.
   Madson then elicited the information that the Arco Juneau was
traveling at full sea speed of 16 knots, or 18.4 mph, while the
Exxon Valdez was on maneuvering speed of 12.4 knots, or 14.3 mph,
in the same area.
   ``I didn't say I approved of what they did,'' Beevers
interjected.
   ``Did you consider that master's actions reckless?'' asked
Madson.
   ``Yes, I would,'' said Beevers.
   ``And do you know if he was prosecuted or not?'' asked the
lawyer.
   ``No, I don't,'' said the witness.
   Outside court, defense attorneys said no charges were filed
against Greg Knowlton, skipper of the Arco Juneau.
   Beevers maintained that Hazelwood erred when he decided to go
around the ice and left the ship's bridge during the maneuver.
   ``My basic criticism is I thought he made his decision too early
without carefully evaluating it'' Beevers said. Other witnesses
have described ice reports from the Arco Juneau as guiding
Hazelwood's decision.
   ``The master should be on the bridge,'' Beevers insisted.
``Traditionally, that is his duty.''
   The witness has said Hazelwood was particularly reckless because
at that point he was the only officer on board licensed to pilot
the ship in Prince William Sound.
   But Beevers acknowledged that another ship, the Brooklyn,
chartered to Texaco, had entered Prince William Sound earlier the
same day with no one aboard holding a pilot's license. He said he
assumed the Coast Guard had waived the requirement. That ship
missed the reef by six-tenths of a mile, he said.
   Beevers also suggested that the Exxon Valdez, with a crew of 19,
may have been understaffed, increasing stress on individual members.
   ``That was certainly the smallest crew on a tanker I'd seen,''
he said. Beevers said the ships he sailed often had a crew of 32,
but by the time he quit in 1987, companies were scaling back to
save money.

<HEAD>Shamir Hardens Stance on Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, under pressure
from Likud Bloc hawks, on Thursday hardened his stance on U.S.
proposals for convening peace talks with a Palestinian delegation.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Shamir ruled out
participation of Arabs from East Jerusalem in the process and said
there was no need for two exiled Palestinians in a proposed
10-member negotiating team.
   ``Who needs them?'' Shamir said of a reported compromise
proposal to include two deported Palestinians to meet PLO
conditions that the team include representatives from the nearly 3
million Palestinians who live outside Israeli-held territory.
   Shamir said Israel's plan to hold Palestinian elections was not
aimed at finding an ultimate solution but an interim self-rule
scheme for the 1.7 million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We are not going to solve the problem of the Palestinian
diaspora. It is not our task,'' he said.
   Shamir stressed that 130,000 East Jerusalem Arabs would be
excluded from the election proposal and from the negotiating team
that is slated to meet in Cairo to plan for the balloting.
   ``It's clear that whoever lives in east Jerusalem will not be
able to participate in these negotiations,'' said Shamir.
   Pro-Shamir Likud sources who demanded anonymity said Shamir had
dropped earlier caution designed to encourage compromise and avoid
friction with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Labor
Party hawks such as Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   They said Shamir had adopted a tougher line because of an
internal revolt against the plan by Likud hawks who could attempt
to oust him.
   The hawks mustered 23 of the party's 40 parliament members to
call for a party meeting before Shamir gave his final answer to
Baker's compromise proposals.
   Shamir said the challenge was ``not very serious'' because he
had support from ``80 percent or more'' of his party.
   ``The great majority of my party supports me without doubt or
hesitation,'' Shamir said, vowing to provide the Israeli Cabinet
with his final position on Baker's proposals ``in a few days or
weeks.''
   Shamir, in a 30-minute interview wedged between meetings with
party officials, lashed out at U.S. officials who said Israel
should not settle Soviet immigrants in the predominantly Arab
sector of Jerusalem, which was captured from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East War.
   ``We are very upset by some statements about the immigration of
Soviet Jewish people saying that they not be permitted to live in
East Jerusalem,'' he said, noting that 100,000 Israelis already
lived in the Arab sector.
   Speaking on army radio, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Shamir's Likud Bloc said U.S. officials told him in
Washington this week that settling Soviet immigrants in East
Jerusalem was improper.
   Netanyahu said such statements raised questions about whether
``a framework exists today to continue the peace process.''
   ``These things raise doubts regarding the basis of understanding
with the Americans,'' he said.
   Shamir and Netanyahu spoke before Baker announced in Washington
that the Bush administration would consider cuts in Israel's $3
billion annual aid if the overall foreign aid program had to be cut
to provide funds for new crisis areas.
   Shamir Spokesman Avi Pazner had no immediate comment, but the
announcement was likely to be viewed here as a form of pressure on
Shamir to accept the U.S. proposals.
   Shamir is also under pressure from the rival Labor Party to make
a decision by March 7 on whether to accept U.S. proposals for
starting talks.
   Party leaders reiterated they expected Shamir to make a final
decision soon on whether to hold a dialogue with Palestinians in
Cairo.
   Yaakov Tzur, Labor's health minister, said on army radio ``the
time has come to make a clear decision. Seven months have passed.
... The Americans and Egyptians have made proposals and we have to
honor them without hestiations and go on,'' he said.
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, said in an earlier
interview he doubted Shamir could accept the Baker proposals and
suggested he might try to form a Labor-led government if Shamir
failed to respond positively.

<TEXT>
   Federal officials aren't getting many
takers for the disaster loans they brought to McCaysville after a
devastating flood, leading one merchant to say with dread, ``This
might be a ghost town.''
   ``Everybody's leaving. Nobody's rebuilding,'' said the merchant,
William Jabaley, whose family has owned the town's only department
store since 1921.
   Government spokesman Guido Pettinelli said merchants are taking
``a poor attitude'' in refusing the low-interest loans. The
merchants, already suffering hard times before the flood, say they
couldn't make the payments.
   Mid-February flooding caused damage estimated at more than $5.5
million in Fannin County, which includes McCaysville, and $5.3
million in Polk County, Tenn., which includes McCaysville's
neighbor, Copperhill.
   The floods came during two weeks of tornadoes and other storms
that prompted President Bush to declare disaster areas in 13
counties in Georgia, 24 in Alabama and two in Tennessee.
   McCaysville and Copperhill especially suffered because they
already had severe economic problems. The two towns have one
industry _ Tennessee Chemical Co., a copper mining company that
once employed more than 2,000 residents but now only 400.
   In McCaysville, a town of about 400 phe month because of differences
in sales-reporting calendars.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., said:
``We remain somewhat cautious'' given continuing high consumer debt
levels and sluggish trends in the financial and real estate markets.
   Retailers could have a tough time this year coping with the
effects of what have been dubbed ``rolling recessions,'' which are
rippling through parts of the manufacturing sector, such as the
automobile industry.
   A widely watched barometer of manufacturing health showed a 10th
straight monthly decline in the sector during February. The
National Association of Purchasing Management's index stood at 48.3
percent in February, up from 45.2 percent in January. A reading
below 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally
declining.
   Monroe Greenstein of Bear Stearns &amp; Co. Inc. said retailers
probably will have a mediocre year in 1990, similar to 1989.
February marks the start of the fiscal year for many retailers.
   Analysts were reluctant to attach too much significance to the
results because February is typically a slow time for business in
the retail trade. January and February are transition months as
winter merchandise is cleared out to make room for fresh spring
lines.
   In contrast to the chains that did well last month, Sears,
Roebuck and Co., the country's biggest retailer, continued to
struggle.
   The giant Chicago-based general merchant, which began a new
merchandising strategy a year ago hoping to reverse years of
market-share losses, had a ho-hum February. Sales were virtually
flat, at $2.127 billion in the four weeks ended Feb. 24, vs. $2.126
billion a year earlier.
   Sales at Sears stores open a year or longer edged up only 1.5
percent.
   Retailers and industry analysts prefer to focus on sales
comparisons for stores operating at least a year, called same-store
or comparable-store results. Newly opened stores typically enjoy a
period of unusually brisk business that isn't sustained over time.
   One standout among the retailers reporting Thursday was Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. The big Bentonville, Ark.-based discount chain said its
February sales surged 33 percent to $1.95 billion from $1.47
billion a year earlier. Sales at Wal-Marts open a year or longer
posted a healthy 17 percent gain.
   By either measure, Wal-Mart consistently has been a star
performer as it expands across the country.
   Currently ranked No. 3, there is widespread speculation in the
industry that Wal-Mart this year could overtake Sears and K mart
Corp. in merchandise sales volume in the United States.
   K mart, based in Troy, Mich., recently stepped up efforts to
respond to the challenge.In a bid to boost sales and profit, K mart
will accelerate its store opening and renovation program, taking a
$422 million after-tax charge to carry out the plan.
   K mart's report on last month's sales will be released March 8.
   Many of the retailers who in recent years have reported their
monthly results on the first Thursday of every month will be
reporting later in March. There is an effort being made within the
industry to reach a compromise on a single monthly reporting date.
   Here are some reports released Thursday:
   Dallas-based department store operator J.C. Penney Co. Inc. said
sales at its stores and through its catalogs rose 8.1 percent in
February to $880 million from $814 million a year earlier. Sales at
stores open for at least a year were up 7.2 percent.
   Melville Corp., the Harrison, N.Y.-based owner of off-price and
other retailers, said February sales rose 11.7 percent to $503.2
million from a year earlier's $450.6 million.
   Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., based in Chicago, reported a 2.5 percent
February sales gain to $299 million from $291.8 million. Last
year's figures were restated to exclude discontinued lines.
   Woolworth Corp., the New York-based parent of numerous specialty
stores including the Foot Locker sports shoe chain, said its
domestic February sales jumped 13.7 percent to $330 million from
$291 million. Same-store sales rose 11.7 percent.
   Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, said:
``February's double-digit percentage gains in total and domestic
sales were the highest for that reporting period in over 10 years.''

   The Internal Revenue Service said Thursday it
has not decided whether to appeal a Tax Court decision that
overturned a $609.5 million IRS ruling against the estate of
publisher Samuel I. Newhouse.
   The court, in a decision published Thursday, sided with the
estate on the only issue in one of the biggest tax disputes in the
nation's history: the value of Newhouse's stock in the family's
publishing and broadcasting operations at the time of his death in
1979.
   The IRS had contended that Newhouse's holdings in Advance
Publications, Inc., and Newhouse Broadcasting Co. were worth a
combined $1.32 billion. The estate, whose executors are his sons,
Samuel I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald E. Newhouse, inisted the value
was $247.1 million.
   After weighing weeks of testimony from both sides, Judge John
Williams Jr. discounted the value of the stock to $235.6 mllion.
``The experts, whose opinions were well-reasoned, disagreed about
almost every issue, and we find that a willing buyer would have
been uncertain about the rights and privileges of ... (Advance)
common stock,'' he wrote.
   That uncertainty, coupled with restrictions in Advance's
corporate charter that barred an outsider from controlling the
company, would depress the stock price, the court reasoned.
   IRS spokesman Steve Pyrek said agency lawyers are reviewing
Williams' 100-page opinion before deciding whether to appeal.
   The IRS wanted to value Newhouse's stock as if the components of
the publishing and broadcasting operations were being sold
separately. The estate argued that was not realistic because of
restrictions in the corporate charters that severely limited
opportunities for breaking up the companies.
   Williams based his decision in part on a report by Goldman Sachs
&amp; Co., an investment banking firm, on the value of Advance.
   ``Goldman Sachs concluded that only another media company would
be interested in acquiring Advance and that none of the major media
companies would have considered buying the common stock (by far the
largest portion of the estate) without first eliminating the claims
of the preferred shareholders,'' Williams wrote.
   He held that Goldman Sachs was correct in devaluing the Advance
stock by 35 percent because of the lack of marketability of the
stock and the prohibitions against outside control.
   Under Advance's charter, owners of Class A voting common stock
have exclusive rights to elect the board of directors; Class A and
B (non-voting) common-stock owners vote on any merger; holders of
preferred stock have the upper hand on any liquidation, and owners
of all three classes of stock participate in dividends.
   At the time he died in 1979, the elder Newhouse owned all the
outstanding shares of Class A and B common stock in Advance. Other
family members owned all the preferred shares.
   Media baron Rupert Murdoch, testifying for the Newhouse estate,
said he would have found Advance an unattractive purchase because
of the difficulty in gaining control of the company and because of
federal limitations on media ownership.
   Douglas McCorkindale, vice chairman of Gannett Corp., said
Gannett would not be interested in Advance common stock unless the
preferred shares also were for sale.
   Even in the absence of restrictions on control, Williams wrote,
the sheer size of Advance meant that ``the sale of all of Advance's
newspaper and magazine properties at one time would have had a
seriously depressing effect on the market for such properties.''
   The IRS earlier had dropped an effort to add a $304.8 million
fraud penalty to the assessment, which would have pushed the total
at issue to more than $914 million.
   Newhouse's media empire was launched in 1922 when he and an
associate bought control of The Staten Island (N.Y.) Advance. At
the time of Newhouse's death, Advance was the nation's fourth
largest newspaper-magazine publisher, with 50 newspapers in 22
markets and the Conde Nast publications, including Vogue, Glamour
and House &amp; Garden.
   Newhouse Broadcasting operates stations, cable systems and
microwave facilities in several states.

<HEAD>Juvenile Justice Nominee Called Lacking in Experience</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats said Thursday that a conservative
nominee to head $70 million in juvenile justice programs lacked
experience and they questioned his ties to the Moral Majority.
Republicans declared he was fully qualified.
   ``I am troubled that an individual apparently without the
requisite credentials would be nominated for this important
position,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``The stakes are
high if we are determined to protect our youth from becoming
involved with drugs and crime.''
   The criticism came as the Senate Judiciary Committee took up the
nomination of Republican education adviser Robert Sweet as
administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Deliquency
Prevention.
   The office distributes millions of dollars in federal grants to
state and local agencies to combat juvenile deliquency.
   Sweet received a cool reception from Democrats who indicated he
could have a tough time winning confirmation.
   The former White House adviser and one-time head of the New
Hampshire Moral Majority has drawn critics ranging from the
National Parent-Teacher Association to People for the American Way,
a liberal Washington group.
   Some of the antagonism appears to be an outgrowth of fierce
political infighting at the Department of Education while Sweet was
an aide there in the early 1980s. Former Education Secretary Terrel
Bell was highly critical of Sweet in his memoirs, ``The Thirteenth
Man.''
   Sweet supporters range from the Boys Clubs of America to Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who has been pointing out that many
opponents are financial beneficiaries of the government's junvenile
justice programs.
   ``It's understandable, may I observe, that the grantees would
like one of their own to be head of this office, but that may not
be such a good idea from the standpoint of prudence,'' Humphrey
told the committee.
   The 52-year-old Sweet, a former high school teacher and textbook
salesman, told the panel that he had devoted his entire career to
helping young people and that his education background should
fulfill a law that requires a juvenile justice administrator with
experience in the juvenile justice field.
   ``I want to be an advocate of helping young people have a better
shot at life than they otherwise would have,'' Sweet said. He said
he has been studying juvenile justice issues and would be able to
quickly grasp details of the job.
   Some Republicans were quick to back the nominee. ``I believe
that Bob Sweet is fully qualified for this position,'' said Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``I know him personally and I support him.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., however, asked the nominee for
written answers to a number of questions about juvenile justice
issues.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., asked Sweet if he had ever joined an
organization such as the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People that would have given him experience with
minority youth. Sweet said he had not and that he was ``not much of
an association person.''

<HEAD>Co-Defendant Wants Trial Moved From Anti-Castro Miami</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case against Manuel Noriega is so closely
linked to Fidel Castro that it should be moved out of militantly
anti-communist south Florida, a co-defendant's attorney said in a
motion filed Thursday.
   Samuel Burstyn, an attorney for former Panamanian army Lt. Col.
Luis del Cid, said the U.S. District Court trial should be moved to
San Francisco, New York or Puerto Rico.
   Such motions are rarely granted, and judges normally attempt to
seat a jury before ruling on a change-of-venue motion.
   Burstyn said Castro was an unindicted co-conspirator in the
February 1988 drug-trafficking indictment against the ousted
Panamanian dictator. He said the Cuban leader mediated a dispute
between Noriega and Colombia's Medellin drug cartel after a raid on
a cocaine laboratory that Noriega was supposedly bribed to protect.
   The U.S. government ``has already made plain ... its intention
to poison the well by emphasizing the role of communist Cuba in the
principal conspiracy charges in this case,'' Burstyn said in the
motion before Judge William Hoeveler.
   Burstyn said that during del Cid's unsuccessful attempt to get
bond, prosecutors released a photo of del Cid, Noriega and Castro
meeting in Cuba.
   ``Even if an entirely `non-Latin' jury was seated, the pressure
on the jury, in effect, to convict Fidel Castro, will be
enormous,'' the motion said.
   Burstyn said south Florida is ``dominated'' by Cubans,
Nicaraguans and exiles from other Central American fleeing
communist dictatorships.
   Del Cid, who was indicted for allegedly handling a drug payoff
for Noriega, is attempting to negotiate a plea bargain in return
for cooperating against Noriega.
   Burstyn said talks with prosecutors were continuing, but no
agreement has been reached.
   The judge has targeted late November for the trial, but says it
would begin by January. Many attorneys, citing the complexity of
handling classified documents before and during the trial, say it
could be mid-1991 before jury selection begins.

   Higher prices and mortgage rates dampened the
ability of the typical American family to buy a house in January, a
real estate trade group said Thursday.
   ``The increase in mortgage rates should be temporary _ we expect
lower rates this spring,'' John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for
the National Association of Realtors, said.
   ``This should improve overall affordability conditions in 1990,
especially in areas where there is an ample supply of moderately
priced homes,'' he added.
   The Realtors said their affordability index fell to 104.2 in
January, meaning that a family earning the national median income
of $33,708 had 104.2 percent of the income needed to qualify for a
median priced home costing $96,200.
   The median means that half of the families earn more and half
less, or that half of the houses sell for more and half for less.
   The median income was up $108 from $33,600 in December, while
the median price rose $3,700 from $92,500 a month earlier. The
income needed to qualify for a loan on the typical home rose $1,298
from $31,066 in December.
   Interest rates, meanwhile, rose from 9.96 percent in December to
9.98 in January. The association uses a composite rate reflecting
both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages.
   The changes meant a $27 increase to $674 in the monthly mortgage
payment, which represents 24 percent of the median family's income.
   The index was down from 108.2 in December, the highest level
since it measured 110.5 in January 1989.
   ``Despite the January decline in overall affordability
conditions, the index is over 100.0, which is considered to be a
good range,'' said Realtors President Norman D. Flynn.
   ``However, with the median home price and the average mortgage
rate increasing, naturally we will see some people squeezed out of
the housing market,'' he added.
   The Realtors said last month that typical first-time buyers
already were unable to enter the starter-home market during the
fourth quarter of 1989.
   The affordability index for them was only 74.4. It was 71 in
both the second and third quarters of 1989.

<HEAD>Foretich Says He'll Abide By Court Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of Hilary Foretich
said Thursday he would abide by a court order not to contact the
child he tracked across two continents during a fierce custody
dispute.
   A court issued the temporary order pending a ruling on whether
Dr. Erich Foretich can see his 7-year-old daughter for the first
time in two years. A date has not been set for the family court
ruling.
   Hilary's mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, went to jail for 25
months rather than reveal the whereabouts of her daughter, whom she
said was sexually abused by Foretich.
   In Washington Thursday, a court ruled that Morgan can have her
passport back so she can go to New Zealand. However, the passport
is in the possession of the city's Court of Appeals and Judge
Herbert Dixon of District of Columbia Superior Court said he could
not order that court to return the document. A decision by the
appeals court was expected later.
   Hilary has spent the last two years with her maternal
grandparents in New Zealand during Foretich's search.
   Foretich, a 45-year-old dentist from Falls Church, Va., said
Thursday he would abide by the temporary family court order not to
contact his child.
   Asked at Christchurch Airport how he tracked his daughter,
Foretich said he did it with ``the help of police departments and
private dectives who were able to do these things.''
   He said he hoped to see his daughter soon and spent the day
consulting with his lawyers.
   William Morgan, Foretich's father-in-law, has vowed to call
police if Foretich approaches the child.
   ``The reason we're staying in Auckland as opposed to here is to
keep some privacy in my daughter's life,'' Foretich said at the
airport. ``That's most important, paramount to me.''
   He also said he was certain the New Zealand judicial system
would rule in his favor.
   Dixon ordered Morgan to jail for contempt of court in August
1986 for refusing to allow Foretich to visit the girl. Morgan was
released three days later by the appeals court, which required her
to surrender the deed to her house as bond and turn over her
passport.
   In February 1987, Dixon sent her to jail again, but she was
released three days later after agreeing to allow Foretich's visits.
   In August 1987, Dixon jailed Morgan for a third time. She
remained imprisoned until September 1989.
   In his order Thursday, Dixon noted Morgan remained in contempt
of court.

<HEAD>Mongolia Hopes to Speed Up Reforms, Premier Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia's Communist government hopes to speed up
political and other reforms by cooperating closely with a newly
formed opposition group, its premier said Thursday.
   ``Looking at their proposals, we want to help speed up reforms
as much as possible,'' Premier Dumaagiyn Sodnom said at a news
conference. ``This is not limited to the economy, as we also must
reform politics. We are studying their proposals very carefully.''
   Long an ally of the Soviet Union, Mongolia has been experiencing
some of the democratic pressures sweeping Eastern Europe. All
statues of the late Soviet dictator Josef Stalin have been torn
down in recent weeks, and last month the Mongolian Democratic Party
was established by the reformist Mongolian Democratic Union. It is
calling for an end to the Communist Party's nearly 70-year monopoly
on power, and a multiparty parliamentary system.
   The union also seeks the resignation of the Communist Party
Central Committee, the Great People's Hural (Parliament) and
Council of Ministers, of which Sodnom is chairman. At its Feb. 18
congress, it promised to increase workers' income.
   ``The new party was formed without a confrontation with the
government,'' Sodnom said at the Japan National Press Club. ``The
Mongolian Democratic Union is made up mostly of young people. They
are among the intellectuals of society, but there are workers too.
They are our children.''
   Sodnom is the highest-level Mongolian official to visit Japan.
He has met with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and other leading
Japanese officials since he arrived Tuesday for a six-day visit.
   Sodnom told Kaifu Mongolia would pursue democratization and
reform its economy, a Foreign Ministry statement said.
   Japan plans to extend trade insurance to Mongolia and send a
delegation to Ulan Bator this month to explore a grant-in-aid,
Kaifu said in his meeting with the Mongolian premier.
   The two met shortly after the two countries' foreign ministers
signed a trade agreement granting Mongolia most favored nation
status. Two-way trade rose from $30.2 million in 1988 to $43
million last year, according to Japanese figures.
   ``A valuable step forward was taken today,'' Sodnom said of the
accord. ``There is a clear feeling on both sides to encourage
cooperation. Many studies are being done now.''
   He said the Japanese trade insurance will make it possible for
Japan to sell Mongolia materials for the construction of a
small-scale steel mill under deferred payment terms.
   Mongolia is working on foreign investment protection laws and
applying for membership in the Asian Developent Bank and other
financial institutions to help develop its economy, Sodnom said.
   ``We have always supported this organization, and so we
joined,'' he said. ``We will continue in this direction.''

   Martin Luther King III apologized Thursday for
saying ``something may be wrong'' with homosexuals, and met with
angered gay rights leaders to learn more about their concerns.
   The son of the slain civil rights leader said the legacy of his
father's life was ``the struggle to free this country of bigotry
and discrimination. This struggle must include a greater commitment
to eradicate homophobic violence and discrimination.''
   King enraged homosexuals Tuesday when he told middle school
students in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that ``something may be wrong in
the makeup of that individual if they happen to be that way.''
   ``Any man that has a desire to be with another man has a
problem, in my opinion,'' he said. ``And that applies to any woman
who has a desire to be with another woman.''
   On Thursday, he told reporters that his remarks were
``uninformed and insensitive.''
   ``For this I extend my sincere apology to the entire community
and in particular to the gay and lesbian community, certainly which
has been hurt most by this incident,'' said King, a Fulton County
commissioner.
   Leaders of local gay rights organizations said they were
satisfied with the apology, and praised King for his candor.
   Gay rights leaders met privately with King for about 25 minutes
after the news conference and said another meeting was scheduled
Friday to lay the groundwork for what King called ``an ongoing
dialogue with leaders of the gay and lesbian community.''
   Bill Gripp, chairman of the board of the Atlanta Gay Center,
said his organization received about 200 calls Wednesday about
King's remarks. He said most callers were either surprised or
angered by the comments.
   ``We've all made statements that we regret at times, and I think
the important thing here is that the commissioner made a very
positive statement, right up front,'' Gripp said.

   Two residents have put up a billboard asking
a million-dollar question _ how much should Ivana Trump get in her
divorce from Donald Trump?
   The sign was put up Tuesday at an intersection in this central
Pennsylvania town. It reads: ``Do you think Ivana Trump should get
more than $25 million?''
   Mrs. Trump's attorneys have rejected a $25 million sum specified
in a prenuptial agreement.
   In arranging for the billboard, residents Lea Isenberg and Jim
Smith had a motivation familiar to real-estate developer Trump _
the profit motive. The billboard gives 900-line phone numbers to
call to vote yes or no, for a charge of $1.
   ``When we first started kicking it around at work, we actually
discussed creating our own game titled, `Trump _ the Divorce,'''
Isenberg said Wednesday. ``But we found out we could actually make
some money through the billboard idea.
   ``In just two days we've been contacted by people from as far
away as San Antonio, Cleveland, Memphis and Detroit,'' she said.
   During that time they received 54 calls, 58 percent in favor of
giving Mrs. Trump more money and 42 percent against it, Isenberg
said.

   He lives in Japan and she lives here. This
weekend they will tie the knot _ with the help of a phone line.
   Leah Townsend plans to marry Randy Conner, based in Okinawa,
Japan, by telephone _ even though the long-distance connection
means they will have different wedding anniversary dates.
   The proxy wedding is set for Saturday at 4 p.m. in Texas, which
is 7 a.m. Sunday in Okinawa. Ms. Townsend's half of the ceremony
will take place at the home of Conner's parents in the Dallas
suburb of Plano.
   Conner is a communication specialist with the U.S. Air Force.
Ms. Townsend is studying education for the deaf at Texas Women's
University in Denton.
   Conner's brother will stand in for him in Texas. State law
allows the groom to send notarized papers to the county clerk's
office giving consent for a proxy to take his place.

   Steve Fisher said he didn't know trouble
was brewing on his beer delivery route when at least 43 12-packs
fell out of the back of his truck.
   ``I thought I had the side door locked down, but I guess it
wasn't locked down all the way,'' Fisher said. ``What with
(Interstate) 40 being as rough as it is, it just jarred everything
loose.''
   He was called by police about 30 minutes after Wednesday's beer
spill to pick up the mess.
   Fisher had left a trail of canned and bottled brew along the
route between two stores. Police said they found 12-packs on at
least three corners, but they said it was possible additional
containers were swiped from other streets.

Thursday on future air pollution controls for automobiles,
factories and electric power plants, enhancing chances that a clean
air bill will pass this year.
   The agreement, after more than three weeks of closed-door
negotiations, was viewed as a middle ground likely to attract
enough support to thwart continuing regional opposition in the
looming Senate debate.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the compromise
a ``sound and comprehensive'' agreement that will substantially
improve air quality over the next decade. He planned to bring the
legislation to the Senate floor up on Monday.
   ``President Bush is extraordinarily pleased with the agreement.
It is a milestone, an enormous step forward,'' said Roger Porter,
the president's chief domestic policy adviser.
   Porter said the administration would attempt to expedite Senate
passage and seek a similar agreement in the House, where clean-air
legislation remains in committee.
   But the compromise is still likely to encounter stiff industry
lobbying, largely because of its estimated $20 billion to $40
billion annual cost to the economy.
   Some senators also have expressed concern that the bargaining
weakened provisions in the original Senate bill that would have
required stronger automobile emission controls to combat urban
smog. Other have voiced continued concern about the impact of acid
rain controls.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, called the
compromise ``a giant step forward'' in revising federal air
pollution laws for the first time in 13 years. But he cautioned
that many senators likely will seek changes when the measure goes
to the Senate floor.
   He urged Mitchell ``not to handcuff anyone'' during the floor
action by rushing to cut off debate.
   The agreement made some accommodations to regional interests,
especially those concerned about the local economic cost of acid
rain controls.
   On that score, the compromise continues to require a 10 million
ton annual reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions, but allows
Midwest utilities to achieve special credits that could be sold to
other utilities to recoup some of the costs. Plants that use new
technology _ instead of switching away from high-sulfur coal to
another fuel _ would receive additional credits for early cuts in
emissions, a provision designed to help West Virginia's coal
industry.
   About a dozen senators from the Midwest had threatened to
filibuster the legislation if some accommodation were not met to
ease their concerns about the high costs of the pollution controls.
   Mitchell said he still could not discount the threat of a
filibuster, but various Senate sources suggested that with the
compromise, Mitchell likely would have enough votes to halt debate.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he would seek additional changes
to the bill. But ``I'm not going to engage in any filibuster,'' he
said.
   The breakthrough on the legislation came Wednesday when leaders
agreed on pollution curbs on automobiles.
   The compromise eliminates an automatic second round of auto
tailpipe controls, although such measures could be put into effect
if more than 11 of 27 cities with ``serious'' ozone pollution
problems fail to meet federal air quality standards at the end of
this decade.
   The White House had strongly opposed the second round of
controls, as had the auto industry. But environmentalists, state
pollution control officials in areas with the dirtiest air, and
some senators argued the second round of controls are needed to
deal with smog in such areas as southern California and the
Northeast.
   In the final days of negotiations, an agreement also came on the
acid rain provision, after senators from the West were assured that
the utility emission controls would allow for future growth in
electric capacity and some accommodation was made to the Midwest
region.
   Earlier tentative agreements were struck on how to curb toxic
and smog-causing emissions from industrial plants.
   Under the compromise, industrial plants will have to use the
best available technology to curb releases of 192 toxic chemicals
including carcinogens, or cancer-causing agents. Early in the next
decade a ``health standard'' that would require plants to reduce
emissions further, if the cancer risk to nearby residents is still
too high.
   A broad range of industries and businesses also would have to
comply with tougher controls on smog-causing emissions. The
compromise, however, would exempt thousands of smaller polluters,
which would have been covered by the original Senate bill.

<HEAD>Thatcher Faces Crisis Over Unpopular New Property Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher faced a crisis
Thursday after the resignation of 18 local councilors over her
property tax reform.
   Aimed at bringing home the costs of socalist-run local
administrations, the ``poll tax'' has backfired in Mrs. Thatcher's
own Conservative Party heartlands, and she is getting the blame.
   In irate exchanges in the House of Commons on Thursday,
socialist Labor Party legislators said Mrs. Thatcher is ``running
out of both friends and excuses.'' She retorted the new tax was ``a
very much fairer system.''
   But rank-and-file legislators acknowledged the party is in deep
trouble over the tax, known officially as the community charge, and
warned it could cost the next election in 1991 or 1992.
   Mrs. Thatcher's embattled Environment Secretary Chris Patten, in
charge of the tax, said authorities were setting an average charge
of around $620 a person _ sharply higher than the $473 government
target.
   Accusing councils of cynically using the new system as an excuse
to build up reserves while blaming the government for the high
charges, Patten said, ``Nothing could justify behavior like this.''
   On Wednesday night, 18 of the 25 Conservative Party councilors
on the West Oxford District Council resigned from the party to
become independents. The Conservatives automatically lost control
of the traditional Tory area near the university city.
   The rebels complained that after years of following Mrs.
Thatcher's strictures on thrift they were forced to set a poll tax
of $700 a person, instead of a planned $430. The tax starts this
fiscal year.
   ``This came as the final straw,'' said council chairman Margaret
Frost. ``We are people who have been on the political scene for
some time _ hard-working, going along with policies, trying to make
them work when they patently aren't working.''
   The new tax replaces a single property tax levied on the owner
of a house or apartment on the basis of the value of the property.
   The ``poll tax'' is payable by each adult and will bear heaviest
on bigger households, while people living alone will be the main
beneficiaries.
   For example, a couple jointly owning a four-bedroomed row house
in the Labor-controlled north London borough of Camden who now pay
$1,336 a year total will pay $1,002 each in poll tax.
   Mrs. Thatcher's aim is to make every voter pay local taxes and,
she hoped, reject high-spending Labor-controlled local authorities.
   But instead, big bills are also rolling in from Tory authorities
in wealthy districts across the country. Mrs. Thatcher is now
threatening to use central government powers to limit the size of
the charges a council can set.
   The last of the 39 county councils in England announced its
charges Wednesday night amid some angry scenes in city halls.
   Hundreds of smaller district councils have to announce their
charges by March 18.
   Protesters chanting, ``Can't pay, won't pay,'' disrupted the
meeting of the Conservative-led Somerset County Council in
southwest England. Somerset set the tax at $626 a person to help
fund a $417.5 million budget _ up 11.3 percent up on last year.
   At Greenwich, an east London borough, demonstrators threw flour
bombs at Conservative councilors, and in Manchester, police were
called to guard the council chamber.
   Local councils get more than half their funds in direct grants
from central government. They are responsible for services ranging
from schools, the fire department and the local police force to
garbage collection.
   Patten said councils had inceased spending by $5 billion this
year, the equivalent of a 35 percent increase in the old property
tax.
   However, local politicians say the higher-than-expected levies
are partly because of reductions in central government grants, and
high wage demands have forced spending increases.
   The ``poll tax'' is named after a 14th century tax imposed
imposed on a voteless populace, which triggered a Peasants' Revolt
in 1380.
   The government is already unpopular, with record interest rates
running at 15 percent while inflation remains high at nearly 8
percent.
   A Harris Poll in London's Sunday Times this week gave Labor 51
percent of the vote, a 17 point lead and the socialists' most
commanding position since Mrs. Thatcher won power in 1979.

   A couple who stopped talking to each
other they broke up in 1988 are splitting an $11.25 million lottery
jackpot they won this week with numbers they had chosen when they
were dating.
   After breaking up, Gregory McNally and Deborah Rzepa stayed true
to what turned out to be their lucky lottery numbers: 2, 4, 10, 25,
29 and 39.
   The two learned Wednesday they would split the fifth-largest
jackpot in Connecticut Lotto history. It's worth about $225,000 a
year to each for the next 20 years.
   McNally, a 27-year-old press operator for the International
Paper Co. in Putnam, said he and Rzepa decided on the numbers while
they were dating. After they broke up, neither knew the other
continued to play that combination, McNally said.
   On Wednesday, McNally went to collect his prize at lottery
headquarters and his mother and mother-in-law asked who the other
winner was.
   ``I said, `Oh jeez _ that's my ex-girlfriend,''' said McNally,
who has since married. ``I couldn't believe it.''
   Rzepa claimed her prize and left lottery headquarters about 10
minutes before McNally arrived, said a lottery spokeswoman.
   Rzepa, 31, told lottery officials she missed watching Tuesday
night's Lotto drawing and did not find out she had won until she
had read the newspaper.
   ``I thought to myself, `They look like my numbers.' Then I
checked my tickets. I didn't know what to do after that,'' said
Rzepa, who is divorced and has two children.
   Her plans include traveling and immediate retirement from her
job as a machine operator at National Patent in Dayville.
   McNally said he plans to quit his job, but might look for
another.

   Vice President Dan Quayle will confer with
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez in La Guaira, Venezuela,
at the outset of a week-long mission to South America, his office
announced Thursday.
   It will be Quayle's second mission to Latin America since the
Dec. 20 invasion of Panama frayed U.S. relations with some Latin
leaders. Venezuela reportedly had discouraged a Quayle visit in
January.
   Quayle had previously announced he would attend presidential
inaugurations in Chile on March 11 and Brazil on March 15. Quayle
will fly to Venezuela on March 9 and also make stops in Barbados,
Paraguay and Argentina during the six-nation trip.
   There are no plans for Quayle to add Nicaragua to his itinerary.
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who upset the Sandinistas' Daniel
Ortega in last Sunday's presidential elections, is due to take
office there April 25.
   Quayle's office said his meetings with Perez and other Latin
leaders ``will mark the conclusion of the consultation mission
assigned the vice president by President Bush in January.''
   On Jan. 5, two days after ex-Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio
Noriega surrendered to U.S. authorities, Bush said he would send
Quayle to Latin America to assure countries there that the United
States wants to remain ``a friendly, supportive and respectful
neighbor.''
   Bush said the Quayle mission would also signal that the United
States will not neglect democracies in this hemisphere even as the
East Bloc countries abandon communism.
   Quayle and Perez will confer on regional issues and recent
developments in Latin America. The vice president will then fly to
Barbados to meet with Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford and other
eastern Caribbean chiefs of government on March 9-10.
   He will spend March 10-12 in Chile, where Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., will join him in the official U.S. delegation to
the March 11 inauguration of President Patricio Aylwin. Aylwin's
election is ending more than 16 years of military dictatorship.
   Quayle will be in Paraguay March 12-13 to meet with President
Andres Rodriquez and members of his government. On March 13-14 he
will visit Argentina for talks with President Carlos Menem. He will
spend March 14-15 in Brazil to attend the March 15 inauguration of
President Fernando Collor de Mello.
   In both Chile and Brazil, Quayle will hold bilateral meetings
with leaders from Latin America and Europe, his office said.
   Quayle is scheduled to arrive back in Washington early on March
16.
   The vice president visited Honduras, Panama and Jamaica last
Jan. 27-29, and attended the funeral of Jose Napoleon Duarte in El
Salvador last weekend.
   Bush himself went to Cartagena, Colombia, on Feb. 15 to confer
with the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru on drugs. He
reportedly is considering a major trip to South America in the fall.

   The former head of Mexico's Interpol office
who is under U.S. indictment in the torture-murder of a U.S. drug
agent was arrested on drug and weapons charges, the attorney
general's office said Thursday.
   Miguel Aldana Ibarra was picked up Wednesday by federal agents
at a restaurant on the south side of the city, said Arturo Antelmo,
a spokesman for the attorney general's office.
   Agents later raided Aldana's house in Cuernavaca, 50 miles
southeast of Mexico City, and confiscated 2.2 pounds of cocaine,
six automatic rifles and several rounds of ammunition, Antelmo said
in an interview.
   He said there were no immediate plans to extradite Aldana to Los
Angeles, where he faces charges in the 1985 slaying of Enrique
Camarena Salazar, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.
   Aldana was one of five people indicted in January by a federal
grand jury on charges of participating in the murder of Camarena
and his Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar. Their bodies were
found in March 1985 on a ranch 65 miles southeast of Guadalajara.
Camarena had been tortured.
   Camarena had led a series of raids on marijuana plantations
allegedly operated by Rafael Caro Quintero, who is serving a
40-year sentence for the murder and 31 more years for drug
trafficking.
   At the time of the murder, Aldana was head of the Mexican branch
of the international law enforcement agency Interpol.
   The same year as the Camarena murder, Mexican prosecutors say
Aldana was involved in a major plot to smuggle marijuana into the
United States from Mexico. Aldana was arrested in connection with
that operation, which also involved Caro Quintero, Antelmo said.
   According to the spokesman, federal agents in 1985 raided Caro
Quintero's Buffalo Ranch in the northern state of Chihuahua and
found 9,000 tons of marijuana, the biggest drug bust in Mexico's
history.
   Aldana was arrested on a warrant for involvement in the 1985
case at the Buffalo Ranch, and also for the cocaine and six AR-15
automatic rifles found at his Cuernavaca home, Antelmo said.
   Aldana, 44, resigned from his Interpol post Jan. 2, 1986, after
the weekly magazine Proceso said a drug defendant had testified
that a shipment of Colombian cocaine seized at the Mexico City
airport was for Aldana.
   The defendant later recanted, claiming his testimony was made
under duress.
   Since then, Aldana has been a practicing lawyer in Mexico City.
The attorney general's office did not explain why it had not
arrested Aldana earlier.
   The Los Angeles indictment charged Aldana participated in the
killing of Camarena to protect a Guadalajara cocaine and marijuana
cartel, according to the U.S. Justice Department.
   A dozen people have been convicted in the murder. Aldana was
among 19 people named in indictments returned since the original.
   Also named were Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, whose extradition
to the United States on separate charges sparked deadly riots in
Honduras in 1988; and Manuel Ibarra Herrera, the former head of the
Mexican Federal Judicial Police, the equivalent of the FBI.
   Ibarra retired from the Judicial Police in 1988 and is a
fugitive.

   The judge in John Poindexter's Iran-Contra
case Thursday released a list of 140 people who could testify or
whose names could come up at the former national security adviser's
trial.
   Former President Reagan _ whose videotaped testimony in the
Poindexter case is likely to be played back in court _ is on the
list of names contained in a questionnaire that prospective jurors
will fill out.
   Poindexter is scheduled to go on trial Monday on charges of
conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene released a 23-page
questionnaire which asks potential jurors whether they ``know or
have any connection ... with'' any of the 140 people.
   Also on the list are former Secretary of State George Shultz,
ex-White House chief of staff Don Regan and 18 U.S. representatives
and senators. Other names include former national security adviser
Robert McFarlane and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Potential jurors who know any of the 140 through their jobs or
socially likely would be excluded from the jury. The panel will
consist of 12 main jurors plus six alternates, chosen from a pool
of residents from the District of Columbia.
   Prospective jurors also will be asked whether they saw, read
about or listened to any part of Poindexter's immunized testimony
to Congress in 1987 which was broadcast live on national television.
   No portion of a criminal prosecution may be derived from a
defendant's immunized testimony.
   Similar questions about Oliver North's immunized testimony were
asked of prospective jurors last year at North's trial. Potential
jurors who said they had been exposed to North's immunized
testimony were automatically eliminated from the jury pool.
   Among the questions prospective jurors will be asked in the
Poindexter case:
   _``Did you see, hear or read about the videotaped testimony of
former President Reagan on February 16-17, 1990?'' Transcripts of
Reagan's testimony have been publicly released while the videotape
was played back in two courtrooms at the U.S. Courthouse.
   _``Would you be prepared to give the same weight to the
testimony of a high official, such as former President Reagan, a
member of Congress, or any other high government or military
official, as to that of any other citizen?''

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Cuban political prisoner who heads the
U.S. delegation to the U.N. Human Rights Commission attacked Cuba
on Thursday as one of the world's worst human rights violators.
   But the delegate, Armando Valladares, also said the United
States was abandoning its bid to have Cuba placed under special
scrutiny by the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   Villadares said the United States has submitted a more moderate
draft resolution on Cuba in place of a strongly worded text that
failed to win support last year from a majority of the 43 nations
represented on the rights commission.
   Valladares, who spent time in Cuban leader Fidel Castro's jails
before coming to the United States, said the new U.S. draft does
not condemn Cuba, even though the Communist government ``is one of
the world's worst offenders'' on human rights.
   Cuba recently has intensified its repressive policies,
Valladares said.
   The new U.S. draft resolution focuses on reports that Cuban
authorities have taken reprisals against Cubans who testified
before representatives of the U.N. rights commission on its
first-ever fact-finding mission to Cuba in 1988.
   The proposed resolution expresses ``great concern'' about these
reports and calls on Cuban authorities to honor their guarantees
not to take action against Cuban witnesses.
   The U.S. draft also urges U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to provide the commission with complete records of his
contacts with Cuban authorities on human rights issues.
   ``Our resolution is not based on any feelings of vengeance,''
Villadares said.
   ``We are not obsessed with Cuba. We would like to have the case
of Cuba be dealt with as that of any other country,'' he added.
   Ambassador Morris B. Abram, the head of the U.S. mission to the
United Nations in Geneva, said the U.S. draft ``had a great deal of
support'' among commission members.
   But sources in Western delegations, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the latest U.S. proposal has little chance of
winning approval from the commission, which is dominated by Third
World members.
   Last year, the commission rejected a U.S. proposal calling for a
new fact-finding mission to Cuba. The 1988 visit resulted in a
lengthy but noncommittal report which listed numerous allegations
of human rights violations as well as denials by the Havana
government.
   In January, Abram indicated that Washington was still seeking
special measures to monitor the human rights situation in Cuba.
   At the time, he said ``evenhandedness requires that Cuba's
well-documented human rights abuses be given the same attention as
that (in) Guatemala, Chile and El Salvador,'' which all have been
examined by special commission-appointed investigators.
   Villadares' remarks indicated the United States was abandoning
that position.
   While the U.S. has offered a more moderate proposal, there still
have been heated exchanges between the U.S. and Cuban delegations
at commission meetings.
   Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Raul Roa Kouri accused U.S.
authorities of ``trampling upon the rights of millions of U.S.
citizens'' and persecuting human rights activists.
   Cuban delegates attacked Valladares as a
``counterrevolutionary'' who was boring the commission with his
statements.

<HEAD>Interim Gov't Takes Steps Toward Privatizing Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany took the first step Thursday
toward privatizing state industries but set conditions that prevent
a wholesale selloff of major assets, apparently to prevent a buyout
by West Germans.
   Also Thursday, the Foreign Ministry called on West Germany to
start talks to coordinate a common German position to present at
the ``two-plus-four'' conference later this year to steer a course
for unification.
   A ministry statement, carried by the East German news agency
ADN, said East Germany recommends that the Germanys' neighbor
states should be invited to take part in the talks, although
without specifying in what capacity.
   As of now, other participants in the talks will be the World War
II allies: the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
   Poland has been asking to participate. It is worried by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's refusal to give unconditional
guarantees that a united Germany would not claim territory ceded to
Poland at the end of World War II.
   In another political development, the parliament said Thursday
that 35 political parties have registered to run candidates in the
March 18 elections, although no candidate lists have been made
public yet.
   According to plans set out Thursday by the interim government of
Communist Premier Hans Modrow, massive factories run by the state
are to be offered to East German investors on March 15, although
land and fixed assets will be prohibited from outright sale to
foreign buyers.
   The Communist-led government repeatedly has expressed its fear
of being bought out by the wealthy West Germans.
   The conversion to a more Western-style of industrial management
is set to begin only three days before the elections, and the
parliament to be seated by that vote could choose to revise the
plans.
   The privatization plan addresses some of the concerns of West
Germans seeking to merge the two economies, although it stops short
of the full-scale conversion to market principles sought by West
German industrialists.
   Economic reform commissioner Wolfgang Krause said the assets to
remain in public ownership would be under control of the
parliament, which could make exceptions to the sales restrictions.
   He said other details of the conversion remained to be settled
by the newly elected government.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the interim step toward
privatization would give industry managers more autonomy while
hindering ``arbitrary sale of assets and property.``
   East Germany's economy has ground to a halt in recent weeks as
the nation awaits the outcome of its first democratic balloting.
   The lack of detail offered on the privatization plan likely
reflects the interim leaders' reluctance to make major changes
without a public mandate.
   Parliament secretariat chief Herbert Kelle told the Communist
Party newspaper Neues Deutschland that 35 parties have registered
for the elections. Hans-Andreas Schoenfeldt, spokesman for the
election commission, said a final list of parties and candidates
would not be released until March 9.
   Three minor parties were rejected because they failed to fulfill
requirements that they present a platform and a list of party
leaders, Neues Deutschland quoted Kelle as saying.
   Schoenfeldt said he thought moves to postpone the vote by the
German Social Union, a member party of the Alliance for Germany,
would be unsuccessful.
   He said East Germany has no institution that could rule on the
party's petition to postpone the vote and allow small parties more
time to prepare their campaigns.
   Meanwhile, West Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper
reported that East German and West German finance officials have
agreed to a currency union by July 1.
   The report, to appear in Friday's edition, said officials in a
joint currency commission decided that East German citizens'
savings would be exchanged over a period of time at a one-to-one
rate.
   Only savings deposited in East German bank accounts before Jan.
1, or possibly before last Nov. 9, when the Berlin wall was thrown
open, would be converted, the newspaper said.
   The paper said cash up to 1,000 marks could probably be
exchanged at parity. Amounts over 1,000 marks would be cashed at a
less favorable rate.
   The East German government declined to comment on the report,
and West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel last week denied
that any decisions have been made.

   Kalila Dinkins Hoggard was born Wednesday at New Britain General
Hospital in New Britain, Conn., said mayoral spokesman Tom Kelly.
``Mother, daughter and grandparents are all doing fine,'' Kelly
said.
   Kalila's parents, Donna Dinkins Hoggard and her husband, Jay,
also have a son, Jamal, 3.
   ``Kalila'' is Arabic for beloved, the mayor's office said. Her
grandfather's first name means ``beloved'' in Hebrew.

   Pesticide companies would be banned from
exporting agricultural chemicals that can't be used in the United
States if legislation introduced Thursday in the House and Senate
becomes law.
   It's the broadest swipe at the pesticide industry by Congress
since use of chemicals in farming became a high profile food safety
concern.
   ``If the EPA says it is too hazardous to be used on U.S. grown
foods, then it is too hazardous to be used on foreign grown
foods,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee.
   He said a loophole in the law allows U.S. chemical companies to
manufacture here and ship overseas pesticides considered probable
carcinogens.
   ``FDA testing has discovered these banned and unregistered
pesticides in foreign food imported to the United States,
completing what many call the `circle of poison,''' said Leahy.
   Leahy and Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., co-sponsored the measure in the
Senate and Reps. Mike Synar, D-Okla., Leon Panetta, D-Calif., and
Dan Glickman, D-Kan., are sponsoring it in the House.
   Gore said that among the chemicals that would have to stop
production in the United States are chlordane and heptachlor, which
are made only in his home state by the Velsicol Chemical Corp. of
Memphis.
   ``These chemicals are killers. We know that,'' said Gore.
``Velsicol has the same responsiblity of every manufacturer to act
in a responsible way and to protect public health.''
   Gore said he is co-sponsoring the bill because one of the
``leading offenders is in my home state'' and he is concerned about
the safety of his constituents who could be eating imported foods
grown with cancer-causing chemicals.
   Donna Jennings, a spokeswoman for Velsicol, said chlordane and
heptachlor are temporarily off the U.S. market because they are
still under review by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   She said the products are used to kill termites and protect
germinating seeds from other pests. While alternative chemicals
exist for use in the United States, there are some regions of the
world, like the tropics, where weather and pest conditions prevent
other products from being effective, she said.
   ``I don't think U.S. regulators should make decisions for other
countries about what they do and do not need,'' said Jennings.
   In addition to health concerns, Glickman offered a pure business
reason why the chemicals should be kept away from foreign countries.
   ``Continued foreign use of EPA-banned pesticides gives foreign
farmers a competitive advantage over American farmers who produce
their crops in a safe and healthful way. These chemicals increase
crop yields,'' said Glickman, who serves on the House Agriculture
Committee.
   National Agricultural Chemicals Association president Jay Vroom,
however, said the bill would hurt business for U.S. chemical
manufacturers.
   ``A unilateral approach to a global issue does no good and only
puts U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage, and may drive importing
countries to suppliers that may supply far less environmental
stewardship with their products,'' he said.

   A leading federal drug agent who resigned this
week says the nation's multibillion-dollar drug war is being
compromised by inexperienced leaders and a politically fueled
demand for quick success.
   Robert Stutman, until Wednesday chief of the New York office of
the Drug Enforcement Administration, maintained in an interview
that efforts to stem drug smuggling _ a focus of the drug war _ are
virtually futile.
   In unusual remarks for a prominent law enforcement official,
Stutman said the Bush administration has overemphasized the role of
law enforcement in fighting drugs. He urged greater attention to
education and treatment.
   ``For too long American policy-makers and others have depended
on people who carry a badge to solve the problem, and it's not
going to happen that way,'' Stutman said. ``The problem is we
continue to try to sell the American public on short-term answers.
And that's what law enforcement is.''
   Stutman, 46, a 25-year DEA veteran, said he believed that
inexperience in the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy,
led by former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, was
contributing to the policy flaws.
   ``I'm not sure the people who are presently setting policy have
the experience level and are dealing enough with what's happened in
the past,'' he said. ``One of the attitudes I saw in Bennett's
office was, `We don't want to even hear what happened in the past,
because that's all been a failure.'''
   The result, he suggested, is repetition of failure. For example,
he said, when Bennett last year proposed a drive to clean up drugs
in Washington, D.C., DEA officials privately derided the project as
``ODALE revisited,'' after a failed 1972 street-level drug-fighting
program, the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement.
   Fred La Sor, a spokesman for Bennett's office, disagreed with
Stutman's suggestion that its leaders had been ignoring the
expertise of others.
   More broadly, he said: ``We have to do what we have to do.
Congress is asking for results. The White House is asking for
results. The American public is asking for results. We're going
after results, and I think we're getting some.''
   La Sor said the year-old drug policy office was focusing, in
part, on interdiction because the U.S. government handles that work
alone, while state, local and private programs share treatment and
education efforts.
   Stutman, however, argued that interdiction is essentially
ineffective. He noted that the seizure of 43 tons of cocaine
between Oct. 1 and Nov. 15 had no impact on the drug's price and
availability. And in the 1970s, when federal agents staunched the
supply of Turkish heroin, Mexican heroin promptly took its place,
he said.
   ``I would have thought we could have learned from that
mistake,'' Stutman said in the interview Tuesday. ``And yet we are
continuing to depend ... on a drug-specific policy that says,
`let's stop cocaine from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.'
   ``My argument is it's almost an impossible situation,'' he said.
``Does it deserve attention? Absolutely. But that isn't where we
should be putting our emphasis, our leadership and our money, which
are clearly much more needed in the prevention area.''
   Stutman, who led the New York DEA office for nearly five years,
quit to join Stutman Tankel Strang and Hayes, a firm that advises
corporations on anti-drug strategies for their work forces. He also
is co-writing a book and is a drug consultant for CBS News.

<TEXT>
   A legislator took his power to the people
with a ``There Ought To Be A Law'' contest and received suggestions
such as banning kissing in cars and requiring people to use common
sense.
   State Rep. Larry Wennlund selected the two winners Thursday and
said he will introduce the ideas this spring during the Illinois
General Assembly session.
   The winner in the under-18-year-old category was Dawn Downing, a
freshman at Joliet West High School, who suggested insurance
stickers be placed on license plates to make it easier for police
to spot uninsured vehicles.
   In the adult category, Deborah McCormick of Joliet won with her
call for mandatory drug and alcohol tests for all drivers involved
in fatal traffic accidents.
   About 600 people in this northeastern Illinois community of
3,500 offered their 2 cents on what should be the law of the land,
Wennlund said.
   ``If the message is to seek more input from your constituents, I
think it's a healthy message,'' he said.
   Here are some of the suggestions that didn't win:
   _ No naked movies on television, no Playboy channel in Illinois,
and no school for 300 years, submitted by a third-grade class at
Lincoln Elementary School in Monmouth.
   _ Pregnant woman be given stickers _ set to expire shortly after
their due dates _ to allow them to use handicapped parking, from
Beverly McNulty of Berkley.
   _ All state residents be required to have and use common sense,
from a 70-year-old constituent whom Wennlund declined to identify.
   _ No drinking in Illinois, no drugs and no kissing in cars, from
a second-grade class at Lincoln School.
   Wennlund said the winners, selected by a panel of five
journalists, would be invited to Springfield this spring to track
the progress of their bills.
   He said he came up with the idea for the contest last year, when
an educator suggested school-bus drivers be tested annually for
drugs and alcohol.
   ``Ninety percent of laws come from one special interest group or
another,'' said Wennlund. ``Those generated from the average
citizen many times make a lot more sense.''

<HEAD>Democrats Press for Hard Line on Japanese Trade, But Delay
Legislation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON _ (AP) _ Democrats on Thursday urged President Bush
to take a hard line against Japanese trade barriers when he meets
with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu this weekend, but they delayed
action on retaliatory legislation.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., told Bush in a
letter he should go into the meeting Saturday in California with
the new prime minister armed with specific proposals for opening
the Japanese market to more U.S. exports.
   ``The time for talking about the problem is coming to an end and
the time to actually produce results is here,'' Gephardt said,
referring to a continuing annual $50 billion U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
   Bush and Kaifu are meeting just a week after trade negotiators
for the two countries made little progress in talks in Tokyo on
removing structural barriers that effectively keep U.S. products
and services out of the Japanese markets.
   U.S. officials had hoped for more progress after the ruling
Liberal Democatic Party's large victory in Japan's parliamentary
election Feb. 18, but the last round of talks remained focused
largely on technical matters.
   ``Our negotiators are now complaining openly about Japanese
intransigence,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee's trade subcommittee.
   Baucus had planned to asked the committee Thursday to approve a
bill directing the administration to retaliate with new U.S.
barriers to Japanese goods if Tokyo doesn't agree by a June 17
deadline to lower its barriers to American wood products.
   The deadline, established by the 1988 Trade Act, also applies to
Japanese barriers to U.S. satellites and semiconductors.
   Baucus, however, agreed to withhold the bill after U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills told him in a letter Thursday the
administration is prepared to retaliate on its own ``should the
negotiations not conclude satisfactorily and on time.''
   ``Hopefully, President Bush and Prime Minister Kaifu can make
progress on these isses this weekend,'' he said.
   Baucus estimated that Japanese tariffs, building codes and other
structural barriers are effectively keeping out between $1 billion
and $2 billion in U.S. forest products at a cost of 10,000 jobs in
this country.

   A $500 million spy satellite glided
from the space shuttle on Thursday and Atlantis' astronauts
streaked toward a Sunday landing, NASA sources said.
   The sources said the 37,300-pound satellite was ejected from the
shuttle's cargo bay early Thursday.
   Atlantis will land at 1:34 p.m. EST Sunday at Edwards Air Force
Base in California, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The shuttle was launched in darkness early Wednesday and
progress of the mission has been cloaked under a Pentagon-imposed
news blackout.
   A brief announcement Thursday by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration said Atlantis' ``expected landing day'' was
Sunday at Edwards, but the agency did not announce a time or
mention the satellite.
   About the shuttle and its five-member, all-military crew, the
statement said: ``The crew is doing well and orbiter Atlantis
continues to perform satisfactorily.''
   The shuttle's solid rocket boosters arrived around midday
Thursday at a NASA hangar at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station
for several days of assessment, said NASA spokesman Bruce
Buckingham. The boosters separated two minutes and eight seconds
after liftoff and fell into the Atlantic 169 miles from Kennedy
Space Center. They were retrieved by two ships and towed back.
   According to sources, the satellite carried by Atlantis is a
powerful space snoop capable of taking high resolution photographs
from orbit and evaesdropping on electronic communications around
the world.
   The satellite, the sources said, was placed into a high
inclination orbit that will fly over much of the Soviet Union,
including portions in the north not previously observed by a
shuttle-launched satellite.
   By covering most of the Soviet Union, the satellite may play a
role in verifying Soviet compliance with arms agreements.
   Atlantis' is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. The
other crew members are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot,
and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Atlantis' flight is the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth
dedicated solely to the military.

   Federal regulators fined Walt
Disney World $1,000 and ordered the installation of high-density
padding, nets or airbags to safeguard performers in its Indiana
Jones stunt show.
   In a citation disclosed Thursday, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration said actors risked falling onto concrete from
heights of 28 feet in recreating adventure scenes from the Indiana
Jones movie series at the Disney-MGM Studios theme park.
   The agency began investigating the show in October after two
performers were injured in falls. The lack of fall-protection
devices constituted a serious violation of federal safety
standards, said the agency's area manager, Larry Falck.
   The show, which has an Egyptian setting, opened last May.
   Falck said the agency could not demand that Disney make certain
changes, such as adding guardrails, without destroying the sense of
danger the show tries to convey.
   ``We're saying, `OK, you don't necessarily have to do that
because it's certain to ruin the show, but at least put in
fall-protection devices such as airbags, high-density pads or nets,
so that if they fall at least they're not going to be hurt,'''
Falck said.
   Disney spokesman John Dreyer said the company would not contest
the fine and would make the necessary changes without ruining the
illusion of danger.
   ``I think it will be the same exciting show as it is,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Luis Alberto Lacalle, a career
politician and scion of one of Uruguay's most prominent families,
was sworn in Thursday to replace Julio Sanguinetti as president of
this South American nation.
   Before the swearing-in at Congress, Lacalle, his wife and three
children attended a Roman Catholic Mass at Metropolitan Cathedral,
the first time those two ceremonies have been linked in this
agnostic country of 3 million since 1894.
   Lacalle, 48, takes over a once-prosperous beef- and
grain-exporting nation that is suffering economic problems and is
still troubled by the after-effects of a military regime that ruled
harshly from 1973 until Sanguinetti was elected president in 1985.
   The military issue dogged Sanguinetti and his Colorado Party
during his entire five-year term but apparently was resolved when
an amnesty of officers accused of human rights abuses during the
military's crackdown on leftist subversion was upheld by referendum
last April.
   The political stability and freedom that marked this nation from
the last century until the military's 12-year rule was upheld when
Lacalle and his National Party won the Nov. 26 elections.
   Lacalle's top priority is reforming Uruguay's economy, which
like neighboring Argentina and Brazil, has been dominated by the
state and the powerful labor movement for decades.
   Lacalle's goals include slashing inflation by more than half to
50 percent his first year, balancing a fiscal deficit and shoring
up the social security system that once was the envy of many
Western nations.
   Lacalle has political backing for his proposed reforms,
including tax hikes and the sale of money-losing state companies.
But the leftist labor confederation Interunion Workers Plenary has
indicated it will resist any plan that cuts jobs or benefits.
   Sanguinetti referred to organized labor as ``the biggest
obstacle to my administration. ... They are completely politicized
and don't understand reason.''
   Those attending the civil ceremony included the presidents of
Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia and Paraguay as well as
President-elect Patricio Aylwin of Chile.
   After the ceremony at Congress, Lacalle and Vice President
Gonzalo Aguirre were driven to Government House in a 1937 Ford
convertible that belonged to the president's grandfather, Luis
Alberto de Herrera, the National Party's dominant figure this
century.

<HEAD>Disagreement On How To Stop Food-Garbage Hauls By Truckers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Truckers, lawmakers and the Bush
administration failed to agree Thursday on how best to stop trucks
from alternating loads of garbage or chemicals in the same vehicles
used for food hauls.
   ``While there has been almost universal agreement on the need to
end these most egregious practices, unfortunately, garbage
backhauling is still legal and is still occurring every day,'' Rep.
Chris Smith, R-N.J., told a Senate Commerce subcommittee on surface
transportation.
   Nearly a year ago, a Pennsylvania newspaper first reported that
refrigerated food-hauling trucks known as ``reefers'' were being
loaded with municipal solid waste at a transfer station.
   In October, truckers told a House panel about the related
practice of hauling chemicals and juice back to back.
   Concern by food companies has helped pressure truckers to avoid
the practice, said J. Terry Turner, executive director of the
Interstate Truckload Carriers Conference.
   ``Since last July, the problem of transporting solid waste by
truck has been addressed by the marketplace,'' Turner said in a
prepared statement. ``Most, if not all of my refrigerated carriers,
have been required by their customers to certify that they do not
transport solid waste in their refrigerated trucks.''
   The practice is called backhauling because it often occurs after
trucks have hauled food loads to the East. Rather than return to
the Midwest empty, they carry garbage. A trucker testified last
August that he liked hauling garbage because it could not be harmed
en route.
   Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., said his office was tipped last
week about a truck that carried beef and was now hauling infectious
medical waste.
   ``And its next load was to be boxed beef,'' Clinger said. ``Of
course, this incident has been reported to the Department of
Agriculture, but there's not much more that can be done so long as
the practice remains legal.''
   Clinger also showed a photo of a methane gas cloud rising from a
garbage-carrying truck that had previously delivered a load of
avocadoes to New York City. He said the refrigerated truck was
photographed following an accident last year on Interstate 80 near
Clearfield, Pa.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee and the
House Energy and Commerce Committee are trying to reconcile
differences between bills they have approved to end backhauling.
   Among the disagreements Thursday was which federal agency should
take the lead.
   Wilson S. Horne of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service told the panel that USDA would not comment on
two pending Senate bills, since both placed enforcement
responsibility with the Department of Transportation.
   But Alan I. Roberts, a hazardous materials specialist with DOT,
said his agency opposed the Senate proposals because lead
responsibility more properly rests with USDA and the Food and Drug
Administration, with help from DOT.
   Turner, the trucking group spokesman, said the answer lies in
requirements to ensure better packaging of solid wastes. ``The
trucking industry did not create this problem and we should not be
viewed as the villains,'' he said.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Kill 31 Moslems in Kashmir as Million March</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SRINAGAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian troops shot and killed 31
demonstrators on Thursday as an estimated 1 million Moslems marched
through the streets of Srinagar chanting ``Independence,''
witnesses and hospital sources said.
   Hospital sources said at least 100 people were admitted to two
hospitals in Srinagar, with 25 or more in serious condition.
   Witnesses said troops fired on two separate processions of
separatists and sympathizers as they strode toward a prayer ground
to join comrades demanding the independence of Moslem-dominated
Kashmir from predominantly Hindu India.
   The sources and witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In New Delhi, a government spokesman confirmed 18 deaths in the
incidents.
   ``The situation is very bad, very tense. Our head count is 18,
but there is confusion,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be
identified under standing briefing regulations.
   Suspected Moslem separatists assassinated a senior Jammu-Kashmir
state government official on Thursday in this center of the
separatist campaign, government officials in Srinagar said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They said Pushker Nath Handoo, assistant director of the state
information department, was shot as he was about to get into his
car outside his home. Handoo was a Hindu, India's religious
majority, but a minority in Kashmir.
   Witnesses said about 1 million people took part in a procession
to the U.N. Military Observers office in Srinagar, chanting: ``What
do we want? Independence!'' and ``We want freedom!''
   It was the latest in daily demonstrations in Srinagar this past
week to push the secessionist demand.
   The army fired on Moslem militants at 2 p.m. in Zakura Nishad
crossing, six miles from Srinagar, the summer capital of
Jammu-Kashmir, killing 23 people, witnesses and doctors at a
hospital said.
   They said three hours later, soldiers fired on Moslems in Bemina
area, three miles from Srinagar, and at least eight people were
killed.
   The deaths brought to 145 the number of people killed in the
latest round of secessionist violence that flared Jan. 20 following
a government crackdown on Moslem militants.
   Ghulam Rasool Mir, among those wounded by army gunfire, said at
Soora Medical Institute in Srinagar the trouble began when
soldiers, passing by the procession in three trucks, snatched a
flag held by march leaders and the crowd retaliated by hurling
stones.
   He said the soldiers first fired in the air, then at the crowd.
   Another victim, Abdul Gani Dar, said the procession had grouped
in neighboring towns and was marching to the Idgah, or main Moslem
prayer ground, in Srinagar to merge with a larger procession.
   In New Delhi, the government spokesman said the army fired after
a mob attacked a vehicle. ``The firing was more in self-defense,
because the mob had become violent,'' he said.
   The movement for an independent Kashmir has mostly been led by
the area's Moslems, who form about 65 percent of Jammu-Kashmir
state's 6 million people.
   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and
Pakistan after the two lands were partitioned following the end of
British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding areas
of the valley became part of Indian-held Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of India's 880 million population and
Hindus comprise 82 percent. Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists make up
the rest.
   Kashmiri militants earlier campaigned for union with Pakistan,
but now demand independence and the status of a neutral nation.
   India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir.

   Production of illegal drugs increased
worldwide in 1989 as drug abuse rose and efforts to curb
international trafficking were undermined by corruption, the State
Department said Thursday.
   But the department's annual report also noted some bright spots:
Cocaine seizures were up in the United States, Latin America and
the Caribbean, and major cocaine traffickers were captured, jailed
and extradicted to the United States.
   ``There were encouraging developments which were counterbalanced
by major problems,'' said Melvyn Levitsky, the assistant secretary
of state for international narcotics matters.
   Levitsky, testifying at a House panel on international narotics
control, was peppered with questions by lawmakers who were
skeptical about the success of the war on drugs and the accuracy of
the report.
   ``It seems to me ... we are slipping badly on this,'' said Rep.
Larry Smith, D-Fla., noting that production of coca leaf increased
in 1989 despite eradication efforts.
   Citing Peru, where eradication efforts have been stymied by
guerrilla activities, Smith asked: ``Why don't they (the Peruvians)
do something?'' Levitsky said Peru was ``resource-starved.''
   Members also asked why a Jan. 5 memo written by one of
Levitsky's subordinates was watered down. The memo, obtained by The
Washington Post, criticized the government of Bolivia for ``a total
lack of commitment to the anti-drug war.''
   The memo said Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora had appointed
a number of corrupt officials to key anti-narcotics roles,
according to the Post account.
   But the annual report cites ``encouraging signs'' of a new
commitment by the Bolivian government.
   The author of the memo, Kirk Kotula, was unavailable for
comment. But Levitsky said he was angered that the newspaper had
obtained the documen, which was one of several used to prepare the
report.
   Under law, countries which do not cooperate in anti-drug efforts
are ineligible for U.S. assistance.
   But in the four years since the law has been in effect, no U.S.
ally has been declared to be uncooperative or, in State Department
language, ``decertified.''
   Two countries _ Laos and Panama _ were certified, reversing
their status from last year. But the United States told those two
countries _ as well as the Bahamas, Bolivia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru
and Thailand _ what U.S. officials think ought to be achieved in
the drug arena in the coming year.
   Afghanistan, Syria, Burma and Iran _ all counties which do not
receive U.S. assistance _ were not certified because there is no
evidence those countries are taking steps to halt drug production
and trafficking, he said.
   Other countries that were certified included Belize, Brazil,
Colombia, Ecuador, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, Malaysia, Morocco,
Nigeria and Pakistan.
   President Bush granted Lebanon a waiver of certificatin based on
national interest grounds.
   In other areas, the report praised the Colombian government for
its ``vigorous attack'' against the cocaine cartels.
   It said international cooperative efforts led to the freezing of
millions of dollars in drug-related assets and that there were
openings for meaningful cooperation in anti-drug efforts with
Panama, Laos and the Soviet Union.
   On the other hand, the report said, opium production doubled in
Burma, partly because of a cessation of law enforcement activities
and the inability of other countries to influence Burmese policy.
   In addition, it said, ``flagging political will and corruption
among officials restricted progress in a number of major
drug-producing and trafficking countries.''

   Miners in the Ukrainian coal-mining capital of
Donetsk went on a six-hour strike Thursday to press demands that
the entire local Communist Party leadership resign, Soviet
television said.
   The afternoon shift at a number of mines stayed off the job,
according to the TV news show ``Vremya.'' But the Soviet news
agency Tass said many miners at a strike committee meeting were
reluctant to go along, saying the walkout would aggravate the grave
economic situation.
   Nikolai Volynko, committee co-chairman, said the group called on
afternoon shift personnel to stay home in a ``warning strike.''
   If the party officials do not quit as a result, Volynko said,
the committee will call on miners throughout the region to walk off
the job Friday.
   He spoke by telephone from the Ukrainian city 500 miles south of
Moscow in the Donentsk Basin, the top Soviet coal-producing area
that was rocked last summer by strikes as miners demanded better
living and working conditions an local autonomy.
   On Feb. 7, a mass rally held in Donetsk forced the resignation
of the local party chief, A. Vinnik. But a week later, another
rally demanded the entire local party bureau quit.
   Eight members of the Donetsk strike committee went on hunger
strike after the bureau resolved not to tender resignations until a
regional party conference, scheduled April 6-7.
   Volynko said information gathered by the strike committee showed
that a general strike Friday would be joined by the ``absolute
majority'' of all mines in the region.
   But Interfax, the news service of Radio Moscow, said its
correspondent reported that in the Donetsk area ``many mines have
failed to support the call for industrial action.''

   A national mayors' organization and two state
attorneys general endorsed legislation Thursday that would reverse
recent Supreme Court decisions on minority hiring in government.
   In testimony before the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, Indianapolis Mayor Richard Hudnut III and New York
Attorney General Robert Abrams called for passage of the proposed
``Civil Rights Act of 1990.''
   Hudnut spoke for the United States Conference of Mayors and
Abrams for himself and Nebraska Attorney General Robert Spire.
   ``It must be understood that there are people in our society who
have been excluded from the mainstream of opportunity for too long,
and that without some kind of proactive government policy they will
continue to be excluded,'' Hudnut said.
   The hearing focused on efforts to counter the effects of the
1989 Wards Cove decision, which critics complain transferred the
burden of proof in certain discrimination cases to plaintiffs.
   Under the decision, plaintiffs must prove an employer wrong who
argues that some employment practice they are complaining about was
based solely on a neutral, non-discriminatory consideration.
   The proposals would reinstate a standard that had been in
existence since 1972 for state and municipal employees. That
required the employer to prove that the employement practice under
attack was not discriminatory.
   Abrams argued that the old Griggs standard, as it was known, has
benefited employers as well as plaintiffs. As attorney general of
New York, Abrams must argue civil rights cases on both sides.
   ``The result has been the development of selection procedures
that better serve to identify those who are truly capable of
performing the job,'' he said.
   The civil rights enforcement activities of the Nixon, Ford and
Carter administrations, Abrams said, ``served to bring about racial
and ethnic diversity in law enforcement.''
   ``Congress and several presidential commissions have found that
such diversity is essential to the reduction of citizen mistrust of
our law enforcement activities,'' he said.

<HEAD>Arts Students Have a Little Fun With Monet's Famed Impressionist
Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hordes of reverent Impressionist painting fans
crowding the Museum of Fine Arts to pay Claude Monet's grainstacks
homage have inspired a few neighborhood art students to produce a
work of their own.
   ``A New Light,'' which the students erected with hay bales
outside the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, casts exactly that
on the famed works featured in ``Monet in the 90s: The Series
Paintings.''
   Playing on the way the French master captured sunlight and
shadows as they shifted throughout the day on a grainstack outside
his back door, the students are offering a similar peek at a
one-story, modern haystack framed by a free-standing, faux-gilt
frame.
   ``It's something we came up with in response to the exhibit
across the street,'' Margaret Tittemore, one of three students who
conceived the project, said Thursday. ``We're all affected when
there's a blockbuster show over there.''
   Among the more than 200 ``series'' paintings Monet did in the
1890s were 30 each of grainstacks and the Rouen Cathedral, 24
paintings of poplars and 18 of the Japanese bridge over his water
lily garden at Giverny.
   The exhibition, which is in Boston through April 29, includes 86
works on loan from cities around the world and is the largest
series ever assembled.
   The students said they like Monet as much as anyone, but the
internationally publicized collection's arrival has also meant a
battle for parking places, crowded sidewalks and limited access to
the museum.
   So they're taking a little harmless revenge by poking fun at the
whole affair.
   ``This is not a great public art statement. It's just a fun look
at Monet for the 1990s,'' said Tittemore, who has been documenting
Boston's shifting light on film the way Monet captured the rural
French atmosphere on canvas.
   The students replaced the artist's 19th century grainstack with
a 20th century haystack, made up of 100 machine-packed bales
brought in from Sunny Rock Farms in Walpole for $2.75 each.
   ``It's a lot like what Monet saw except it's in cold Boston
instead of sunny France,'' said Elizabeth Nordberg, a Boston
University student. ``It catches your eye.''
   Nestled amid snow-laden shrubs on the edge of one of Frederick
Law Olmsted's urban parks, the bulky straw ``sculpture'' is an
incongruous sight.
   Passersby, bundled against the cold, cast an eye and sometimes
stopped briefly to contemplate the midday shadows and bits of sun
that streaked the sculpture early Thursday.
   A French woman and her young charge were out walking when the
haystack caught the child's quizzical eye.
   ``That's a sculpture,'' she said in Monet's native tongue. ``And
it's not very pretty.''
   They didn't stop to ponder the piece.
   ``Not everyone gets it,'' said Cliff Pfeiffer, a guard at the
red-brick art school's front desk. ``A lot of stodgy museum-goers
who are coming to see the exhibit don't seem to get the humor.''
   But the haystack has found a home among the art students, who
are enjoying the tongue-in-cheek humor ... and something more.
   ``It might be a jibe at what's going on next door, but there's
also some art to appreciate,'' said Laila Streiff, a film maker and
former student. ``When you see the frame it signals ``art'' and
encourages you to look at the design and what is going on in the
texture of the hay.''

<HEAD>Bush Administration May Support Cuts to Free Money for New
Democracies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 3rd graf, The secretary, to move up reference to
peace discussions, reflect that Cabinet meeting now set for Sunday</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration could support cutting
U.S. aid to Israel and Egypt if similar cuts were applied to other
nations as a way of freeing money for emerging democracies,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Thursday.
   Baker told a House subcommittee that ``we're willing to stand up
and be counted'' on such a plan because it would result in the
flexibility to put foreign aid money where it is most needed.
   The secretary also told the panel he has done ``pretty much all
we can do'' to bring the Israelis into talks with a Palestinian
delegation aimed at setting up elections in the occupied
territories. An Israeli Cabinet meeting was scheduled for Sunday.
   In answer to a question by Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of
the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, Baker
said administration support for the cuts would ``depend on whether
we do it in a non-discriminatory manner.''
   In his busy Middle East diplomacy, Baker said, he has not found
any significant reduction in tensions. But he added: ``At the same
time, we must find a way to respond to changes in Eastern Europe,
in Panama and in Nicaragua.''
   ``If these leaders are not able to produce for their people, we
will rue the day'' that the United States fell short in providing
aid, he said. ``We are talking about supporting an extraordinary
outbreak of freedom and democracy.''
   Baker also said he did not want to see a repetition of the
current year's budget crunch, in which some friendly countries that
expected U.S. aid got little or nothing because 90 percent of the
aid budget was already earmarked by Congress for specific other
recipients.
   ``We ought not to be hidebound by what's been done over the past
10 years,'' Baker said. He said economic aid to all of Africa
totaled just $14 million this year ``because there's no one up here
lobbying for them.''
   His comments were the clearest indication yet that the
administration would accept cuts to Israel and Egypt, which get the
largest slice of U.S. aid as a result of their participation in the
Camp David Middle East peace accord a decade ago.
   Israel is receiving $3 billion this year and Egypt $2.1 billion,
out of an overall budget of roughly $10 billion for bilateral aid.
The administration has asked Congress for the same amounts for both
countries next year.
   Baker left himself some latitude, saying he could also support a
total elimination of earmarks or the creation of a new
discretionary fund which the administration could use to meet new
needs that develop during the year. He also said he could support
enlargement of the overall foreign aid budget.
   But he acknowledged that those outcomes are unlikely.
   Earmarks have been almost sacred in Congress because of the
political clout of the countries which receive them and because of
lawmakers' view that such spending guidance is their prerogative as
keepers of the federal purse. It is equally difficult to increase
foreign aid spending because of the popular notion that money spent
overseas is wasted.
   Bush has proposed an increase of about $800 million for fiscal
1991, which begins Oct. 1, to an overall level of $15.3 billion.
But potential new aid recipients have been popping up faster than
the budget can accommodate them.
   Already there are demands for new aid to Eastern European
countries emerging from Soviet domination, reparations to a newly
democratic Panama, and support for the new democratic government in
Nicaragua.
   Earlier this year, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
proposed finding the money for such needs by cutting 5 percent from
the top current aid recipients. The administration denied planting
the idea with Dole at the time, but expressed agreement with its
goal of increased flexibility in distributing aid money.
   In his testimony, Baker also said the administration would
support $400 million in loan guarantees for Israel to build housing
for an influx of Soviet Jewish refugees, but only if Israel offers
assurances that it would not put any new settlers in the occupied
territories of the West Bank and Gaza strip.
   The money is expected to be added to an upcoming supplemental
appropriations bill and is likely to win congressional approval
because of Israel's strong support on Capitol Hill.
   Israel has declined to provide such assurances about future
settlement, but has contended that in the past that about 1 percent
of refugees have settled in the territories.
   ``Settlements are not conducive to the peace process'' because
they aggravate tensions with Palestinian residents, Baker said.
``We see them as an obstacle to peace... It is not unreasonable to
ask some assurances these funds will not be used to create new
settlements or expand old settlements in the occupied territories.''
   Baker also said ``we're coming very close to the time when we
will know one way or the other'' whether Israel will accept a
proposal for talks with a Palestinian delegation about elections
among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories.
   Baker has been expressing growing impatience with Israel's
failure to respond to his proposals, aired during his meetings with
the foreign ministers of Egypt and Israel.
   ``We've really done pretty much all we can do, we think, from
our end, and we are waiting for a response from the Israeli
government,'' Baker said.

   The government opened the competition Thursday
for nearly $80 million that savings and loans and other financial
institutions will be able to use to offer cut-rate loans to promote
affordable housing.
   Under the program, included in last year's legislation to bail
out the S&amp;L industry, the $78.7 million will be used to buy down
the interest rates on certain housing loans, making the financing
affordable to those whose incomes otherwise would be insufficient
to make monthly payments.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, who announced
opening of the bids in his capacity as chairman of the Federal
Housing Finance Board, said the loans could add 20,000 units to the
nation's stock of low- and moderate-income housing.
   Other industry officials, speaking privately, said that number
could be significantly lower but that no firm estimate was possible
until proposals for the money are submitted.
   Federal Home Loan Bank officials who participated in the
drafting of the program have said the $78.7 million to be spent on
interest buydowns should generate between $500 million and $1
billion in housing loans, with the amount again depending on the
terms of the accepted proposals.
   ``This new program will be of significant help to us as we work
to meet our national goal of safe, decent and affordable housing
for all Americans,'' Kemp said in a statement.
   Over administration objections, Democrats inserted the
affordable housing program into President Bush's S&amp;L bailout, which
was enacted Aug. 9. In recent weeks, members of Congress and
consumer advocates have complained about administration
foot-dragging in starting the program.
   Savings and loans and other financial institutions affiliated
with the Federal Home Loan Bank system, such as some credit unions
and savings banks, will have to compete for a share of the $78.7
million, under rules to be published Friday in the Federal Register.
   Each of the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks will establish a
fund for the program, as was required by the S&amp;L legislation. The
regional banks are located in Boston, New York, Pittsburgh,
Atlanta, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco,
Seattle, Des Moines, Iowa, and Topeka, Kan.
   Kemp said higher priority will be placed on applications which
detail proposals that meet three or more of the following
priorities:
   Encouraging home ownership; expanding low-income rental stock;
making federal property available for low-income housing; promoting
activities by non-profit and community groups; empowering tenants
through resident management and homesteading; advancing fair
housing compliance; and creating permanent housing for the homeless.
   The application period runs through May 2. During that period,
Kemp said the government also would accept public suggestions for
changes to subsequent offerings under the program.

<HEAD>Kohl Rules Out Drafting Border Treaty Before Unification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursday
rejected a Polish proposal that the two Germanys formulate a treaty
recognizing the border with Poland, which is nervous about possible
land claims by a reunited Germany.
   Kohl said working out such a treaty must be left for a united
Germany.
   However, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France joined Polish
officials and others who are pressing for such an accord.
   Poland wants the agreement as reassurance that a reunited
Germany would not renew claims to land that the Western allies took
from Germany and transferred to Poland at the end of World War II.
   In his comments to reports, Kohl reiterated that ``no one wants
to make a connection between the question of German unity and a
moving of the borders.''
   He has previously said such an assurance should satisfy Poland.
However, he has refused to say unequivocally that no land claims
will be made.
   Such a position might upset some right-wing West Germans whose
vote could help Kohl's Christian Democratic Party in elections set
for December.
   In his comments Thursday, Kohl also raised the prospect again of
both German parliaments simply making a declaration _ not starting
work on a treaty _to respect the postwar borders.
   Such declarations, however, would probably just restate a West
German parliamentary assurance made in November, which left the
final say up to the leadership of a united Germany.
   Kohl has come under sharp criticism abroad and at home for his
position on the lands east of the Oder and Neisse rivers once held
by Germany and now part of Polish territory. About one-third of
Poland was part of Germany before the war.
   His refusal to say a united Germany would never lay claim to
that land is seen as a major stumbling block on the road to German
unification.
   In addition to Poland and France, the United States, Britain and
others have voiced concern about Kohl's stand.
   In his comments Thursday in West Berlin, French Foreign Minister
Dumas said, ``Putting off the (German) response in order to wait
for the constitution of a single parliament isn't reasonable.''
   ``This border is inviolable. ... That should be said to all the
peoples concerned, and first of all to the Poles,'' he said during
his luncheon address at West Berlin's press club.
   He added that Poland should take part in international
discussions leading to German reunification, as it has asked.
   Poland has suggested that the two German governments and Poland
draft a treaty to recognize the present borders, with the document
to be signed after a united German government comes into existence.
   Splitting with Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
indicated support for the idea. Kohl's position puts him at odds
with Genscher's liberal Free Democratic Party, the junior partners
in the Bonn coalition government.
   Kohl has shown increasing irritation in recent weeks with the
prolonged international outcry over his position on the issue.
   During his press conference Thursday, he said, ``In the
international arena, in East and West, currently the Germans are
facing criticism and a prevailing mood that we might disregard all
the interests of our neighbors,'' said Kohl.
   ``I have always said that a united Germany must be a part of the
total European architecture,'' Kohl said.
   The chancellor said the Germans will ``take into consideration
the interests of our neighbors.'' But, he added, ``that doesn't
mean we should neglect our own interests.''

   The government decision Thursday to give
the Seabrook nuclear plant a commercial license begins a
months-long process leading up to the reactor generating
electricity at full power.
   Seabrook operator New Hampshire Yankee cannot just throw a
switch now that it has a Nuclear Regulatory Commission license.
First it must conduct two to three months of tests.
   During the past several weeks, operators brought the reactor
systems from ``cold shutdown,'' 150 degrees, to ``hot standby,''
heating the primary coolant water to 557 degrees at 2,235 pounds
per square inch pressure. The water was heated by rapidly
circulating it through the cooling system.
   The next steps are to slowly withdraw control rods made of
silver, cadmium and indium from the uranium fuel core. Then
operators will gradually dilute the boron concentration in the
cooling water to create fission, or the splitting of atoms.
   Boron absorbs neutrons, which careen into uranium atoms,
splitting them and releasing more neutrons, creating a chain
reaction.
   At 1 percent of full power, there would be 1 billion times 1
billion fissions per second, raising the temperature at the center
of the plant's fuel pellets to 1,700 degrees.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher said the first fission would take place
within a week or two, with the plant operating at a fraction of 1
percent of full power.
   It would be the second fission reaction at the plant since it
was completed in July 1986; the first was in June 1989 during
low-power testing, when the plant operated at up to 3 percent of
capacity.
   Fission in the reactor core would heat the highly pressurized
water circulating through the primary cooling system, a closed loop
of piping, and create steam out of water in a second closed loop.
The steam would drive turbines, which would drive an electrical
generator.
   Seabrook could reach the ability to produce electricity for
customers within a month, at about 10 percent power, Sher said.
When that threshold is crossed is a matter to be decided by
Seabrook's various owners and the government boards that regulate
them, he said.
   When the plant got to about 50 percent of full power, it would
be shut down so NRC inspectors could evaluate performance.

   A man armed with three large kitchen knives was
shot and killed in his home by police Thursday as he allegedly
lunged at them, the Police Department said.
   David Cotto, 20, was the 14th civilian killed by city police
this year.
   Nine of the 11 shots fired by the officers struck Cotto, who was
pronounced dead shortly after 5 a.m. at his parent's apartment in
Brooklyn, said police spokesman Sgt. Norris Hollomon.
   The incident began as Cotto and an upstairs neighbor, Carl
Billeci, 35, were drinking and playing cards in Billeci's
apartment. The two men began arguing and brawling, Hollomon said.
   Cotto returned to his family's apartment on the first floor. His
parents called police because Cotto was acting irrationally,
Hollomon said.
   Sgt. Vincent Guzzo, 41, and Officers Joseph Galli, 44, and
Patrick Balsano, 33, arrived at the apartment and found Cotto armed
with two 12-inch kitchen knives, a 10-inch kitchen knife and a long
barbecue fork, Hollomon said.
   Cotto was threatening to stab himself, the sergeant said.
   Guzzo sprayed Mace on Cotto to try to subdue him, but the young
man became enraged and lunged at the officers, Hollomon said.
   The officers yelled at Cotto to stop, but when he did not
respond, fired their guns.
   The three officers were treated for minor injuries, cuts and
emotional trauma.
   Cotto had an arrest record dating back to 1985. He was convicted
for robbery and resisting arrest in 1987, police said.

   Small cars driven into barriers and poles at 5
mph to test their bumpers sustained damage ranging from $769 to
$3,838, an insurance study said Thursday.
   The most damaged among 16 1990-model cars tested was the
Daihatsu Charade SE; the least was the Honda Civic DX, the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said.
   ``Every bumper we tested this year did a poor job of preventing
damage, and some were downright lousy,'' said Brian O'Neill,
president of the institute.
   The institute, financed by the insurance industry, buys the
cars, runs each one into flat barriers, front and back, into a
front angle barrier and then backwards into a pole, all at 5 mph.
   O'Neill said bumper performance has deteriorated since 1982 when
the Transportation Department rolled back federal requirements that
car bumpers be able to sustain 5 mph crashes without damage to the
vehicle. The new requirement lets cars sustain certain damage in a
2.5-mph test.
   Collision energy rises as the square of speed, so cars in the
new test must handle only about one quarter of the collision energy
in the old test.
   A 1981 Ford Escort sustained no damage in any of the institute's
four tests, O'Neill said, while damage to a 1990 Escort totalled
$1,718.
   Hyundai Excel bumpers were weakened during the 1990 model year,
he said. An Excel tested before the change sustained $561 damage in
the rear-into-pole test, while the same model with the weaker
bumpers cost $721 to repair.
   Eight cars that sustained no damage when run forward into a flat
barriers, sustained damage costing between $200 (for the Honda
Civic) and $718 (for the Mazda 323 Protege SE) when run into an
angled barrier, the institute said. Among seven cars with no damage
in rear barrier tests, damage in the rear-into-pole test ranged
from $479 for the Dodge Shadow to $1,404 for the Ford Escort, the
report said.
   The institute said it found that Toyota Corollas manufactured in
Japan and exported to the United States have more protective
bumpers than Corollas built in California or nearly identical Geo
Prizms which are built in the same plant.
   The Prizm had $267 worth of damage in the front barrier test,
while the the Japan-built Corolla, whose bumper assembly weighs two
pounds less, had none, the institute said.

   Fierce, frigid winds and blizzards battered Europe
on Thursday and added to the suffering brought on by foul weather
this week that killed 82 people. Britain, France and West Germany
were hit hardest.
   Nineteen people were known dead in France, 18 in Britain, 16 in
West Germany, nine in Belgium, seven in Switzerland, six in Italy,
three in East Germany, and one each in Austria, Greece, Ireland and
the Netherlands.
   Gale-force winds, peaking at 112 mph, buffeted western and
northern Austria and claimed that country's first victim Thursday,
a 26-year-old brewery worker whose car was hit by a falling tree,
police said.
   Suffering the worst damage from flooded villages, blocked roads,
downed power lines and uprooted treees were France, Britain and
West Germany.
   Some towns along Denmark's North Sea coast were flooded. The
Danish search for a West German and his 6-year-old son who ventured
out on a fishing trip in a small boat Monday was called off and the
two were presumed drowned.
   Zermatt, the popular Swiss ski resort, remained cut off by snow.
   Winds reached 125 mph on the 11,408-foot Jungfraujoch Wednesday
night and Swiss authorities warned of avalanche risks in many parts
of the Alps.
   Rail, streetcar and automobile traffic were disrupted in much of
West Germany Thursday by winds up to 95 mph. Schools were closed in
Munich. Stretches of the Autobahn around Frankfurt were blocked for
hours, delaying thousands of people trying to get to work.
   West German police reported four new deaths, including a
48-year-old Turk killed when his car swerved to avoid a falling
tree. Many people were injured. Officials said a man was trapped
under a fallen tree for three hours before being rescued with
serious injuries.
   Prince Charles, the 41-year-old heir to the British throne, and
Princess Diana interrupted a weeklong skiing holiday in Switzerland
to fly to Wales in freezing rain and driving wind to meet some of
the 800 residents evacuated from the seaside resort of Towyn after
its sea wall broke.
   ``Things like this always bring out the best in the British,''
Charles said after visiting nearby Bodelwyddan Castle, where 150
people took shelter.
   Charles, the Prince of Wales, wore a Welsh leek in his lapel in
honor of St. David, the principality's patron saint.
   Wind-whipped seas devastated the seaweed harvest off Wales,
denying Welshmen their traditional St. David's Day breakfast
delicacy of laverbread, which is made with the plant.
   New flooding hit Towyn and neighboring Kinmel Bay and Pensarn on
Thursday as the tide crashed over the damaged sea wall, police said.
   Snow fell throughout Scotland and Northern Ireland and closed
roads and caused many accidents in north and eastern England.
   A cedar tree crashed through the roof of 14th-century St.
Margaret's Church at Starston, in Norfolk. Strong winds and high
tides caused an 80-minute suspension of ferry services from Dover
to France.
   In France, storms that began Monday killed at least 19 people,
the Civil Defense Center for Operations and Administration said. It
said more than 82 have died since the end of January.
   The National Forest Office said storms destroyed about 100,000
trees in Normandy alone since Jan. 25.
   French authorities reported four more deaths during Wednesday's
storms. An uprooted tree killed two firemen, a wave swept a man out
to sea, and a piece of his roof hit a man and killed him as he
worked in his garden. A French motorist died Thursday trying to
avoid a fallen tree, police said.
   President Francois Mitterrand visited the hard-hit coastal towns
of Fecamp and Etretat in Normandy.
   Belgian police said two children died Wednesday night in a house
fire in Meerbeek near Brussels after fallen trees blocked
firefighters' vehicles. A couple died when their car hit a tree
blocking a road southeast of Brussels.
   Austria's Voralberg province and the Motorbahn leading from
Vienna to Salzburg were severely affected by the storm.

<TEXT>
   President Guillermo Endara went on a hunger
strike Thursday, apparently to protest plans to drastically cut a
Bush administration request for U.S. aid to rebuild Panama.
   Endara set himself up in the Metropolitan Cathedral, announcing
his strike was ``in solidarity with my fellow citizens in Panama
who suffer malnutrition because of poverty.'' He made no explicit
mention of U.S. aid.
   However, he hinted broadly at the underlying purpose of his fast
when he told the National Assembly in a speech shortly before:
``Let God enlighten those who have the decision to undertake
efforts to provide the necessary financing to solve our people's
most urgent problems.''
   On Wednesday, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
Appropriations subcommittee that deals with foreign aid, vowed he
would cut the $500 million aid proposal sharply because it was too
much to give to Panama.
   ``I guarantee you that's not going to happen,'' Leahy said,
referring to the aid package. ``There will be no half a billion
dollars.''
   ``I wouldn't support that, and I'm not sure many others will,''
he said in an interview.
   Leahy said congressmen would prefer to give some of the money,
if it is available, to emerging new democracies in Eastern Europe.
He also said he would like to see more go to meet humanitarian
needs in Africa.
   In his speech broadcast on Panamanian radio and television,
Endara said he would continue to work in coming days, despite his
fast. He did not say how long the hunger strike would last.
   In Los Angeles, President Bush announced he had lifted the last
sanctions against Panama imposed for its failure to cooperate in
drug-fighting efforts. The move will allow low tariffs and fees on
Panamanian imports.
   Most of the economic sanctions were removed in December, when
U.S. forces invaded, overthrew military leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, and put Endara in office. Noriega awaits trial in Florida
on federal drug-trafficking charges.
   Endara was widely recognized as the winner of last year's
Panamanian elections, which Noriega annulled.
   Panama's economy has been battered by the sanctions and by
fighting during the U.S. invasion.
   A crowd of supporters accompanied Endara on Thursday as he sat
in the cathedral, two blocks from the presidential palace. He was
surrounded by bodyguards, and several doctors were in attendance.
   Talking to reporters, Endara also called his fast part of Lent,
saying it was an appropriate time for him to express ``human
solidarity'' with his people.
   It is the second hunger strike by Endara, a portly politician of
53, in less than a year. Endara went on the first fast on Sept. 19
to protest repression by Noriega's now-disbanded Defense Forces.
That fast lasted a few days.

<HEAD>Companies Fined Millions For Rigging Bids For School Milk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Southland Corp. and Borden Inc. agreed to
plead guilty to conspiring to rig bids for school milk contracts in
Florida and pay fines totaling $3.5 million, the Justice Department
said Thursday.
   Court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Tampa also charged
the two companies with conspiring to rig bids for contracts to
supply milk to federal military bases in Florida and Puerto Rico
and the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base in Georgia.
   Southland, which operates 7-Eleven convenience stores, and
Borden each agreed to plead guilty to felony bid-rigging charges,
the Justice Department said.
   The plea agreements settling the criminal anti-trust charges
were submitted to a federal judge in Tampa for approval.
   According to court papers, the bid-rigging conspiracy in
counties on the Florida peninsula began in the early 1970s and
extended through at least July 1988.
   Under the arrangement described in the court papers, the
conspirators discussed submitting bids and agreed which company
would be the low bidder for specific school districts.
   Borden and Southland's Velda Farms Division participated in a
scheme to rig bids for the 1987-88 school year in Clay, Volusia,
Brevard, Highlands, Hardee, Pasco, Polk, Sarasota and Lee counties,
according to court papers.
   Southland was also charged with rigging bids in Charlotte
County. The company sold its Velda Farms Division in 1988 when it
spun off its dairy-processing holdings in a deal with Dallas-based
Morningstar Foods.
   Borden also admitted to participating in a separate bid-rigging
scheme involving in Leon, Franklin, Bay, Escambia, Walton and Santa
Rosa counties on the Florida panhandle.
   As part of the plea agreement, Borden agreed to pay $1.5 million
to settle the government's civil claims. Southland agreed to settle
civil claims for $2 million.
   So far, the Justice Department's anti-trust division has brought
14 prosecutions in the continuing investigation of bid-rigging
among dairy suppliers in Florida.
   The probe has netted convictions of three companies and nine
individuals.
   The investigation ``should put an end to the cynical bilking of
our nation's armed forces and the outrageous theft of millions of
dollars from Florida's school-milk programs,'' said Judy Whalley,
acting assistant attorney general in charge of the anti-trust
division.
   Southland spokeswoman Cecilia Norwood, said the company has
cooperated with the investigation since 1988. She said there was no
evidence that senior Southland management or 7-Eleven personnel
were aware of the bid-rigging scheme.
   The scheme was ``confined to a few former Velda Farms employees
in Florida who chose to ignore a longstanding clearly stated
company policy,'' she said.
   A Borden spokeswoman at the company's headquarters in Columbus,
Ohio, who was authorized to speak on the case had left for the day,
said a secretary who answered the telephone.

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's leading opposition movement is
unwilling to return to negotiations on the country's future if the
Communists balk at political reform, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Also Thursday, more than 70,000 people attended a
Communist-sponsored rally at a Sofia sports stadium, an apparent
response to a huge opposition protest meeting on Sunday.
   Sunday's demonstration for democracy and political reform drew
at least 150,000 people. Official Bulgarian media put the number
even higher.
   The rally Thursday, which was broadcast live on state television
and organized by the Sofia party organization, was marked by the
old-style waving of Communist banners and speeches and testified to
the strength of the ruling party.
   The Communists in Bulgaria, unlike those in other Soviet bloc
countries, have retained much of their clout in national politics,
and their moves toward democracy have been hesitant and somewhat
half-hearted.
   Addressing the crowd in the stadium, Communist Party chief
Alexander Lilov appealed for calm and patience and warned fellow
Communists ``not to give in to provocations of the opposition.''
   He accused the opposition of being increasingly aggressive, and
cited as a case in point the temporary ``occupation'' of the
downtown Georgi Dimitrov mausoleum during Sunday's demonstration.
   ``We are a strong, one-million (member) party, and we have an
important role to play in the future of this country,'' said Lilov,
cheered by the participants.
   In an interview Thursday, opposition spokesman Georgi Spassov of
the Union of Democratic Forces said the Communists will have to
make further reforms if negotiations are to continue. The talks
were suspended Feb. 12.
   In one major reform, Communist leaders decided last week that a
new law on parties, to be adopted by the Communist-controlled
parliament next week, would ban party cells from factories, offices
and other institutions.
   But the opposition says the Communists are stalling on other
political reforms and have ignored the Union of Democratic Forces
on such decisions as the appointment of a new radio and television
chief. The current chief is said to have been firmly entrenched in
the party apparatus for 20 years.
   Also angering the opposition is the fact that a week after
committees representing all parties in the talks submitted a
document on Bulgaria's political future, the Communists came up
with a new document that was totally different.
   ``In that draft the Communist Party redefined the role of the
round table (talks) as dealing with the economic crisis only, not
with the political system,'' Spassov said. ``But the economic
crisis cannot be overcome without removing the totalitarian
political system.''
   He said the Communists are still reluctant to relinquish power.
   ``If the Communist Party does not sign the political agreement
that was prepared by the (committees) there will be no round table
(talks),'' Spassov said.
   He accused the Communists of planning to railroad through
Parliament key legislation that neither the opposition nor other
groups have had a chance to discuss or amend.
   He singled out the law on political parties, a law on property
and a law on names.
   The law on names is a sensitive issue because it affects
primarily the 1.2 million Turks who had to change their Moslem
names in a violent campaign spearheaded by deposed Communist leader
Todor Zhivkov.
   Zhivkov was ousted in November as political reform swept the
rest of the East bloc.
   Spassov predicted that Bulgaria's deep economic crisis will
eventually ``crush'' the Communists, whose popularity he said is
dwindling daily.

<HEAD>Report: Pan Am Security Was Relaxed Before Flight 103 Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine months before the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103, the airline abandoned a key safety procedure at Frankfurt
Airport requiring all checked baggage to be accompanied by
passengers, a London newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Independent said investigators now believe the relaxation in
security gave terrorists the opportunity to smuggle the bomb onto
the plane in an unaccompanied suitcase without fear of detection.
   The newspaper said its information was based on an internal Pan
Am memorandum. It said the memo was sent on March 28, 1988, to Pan
Am's security staff in London and Frankfurt, West Germany.
   In New York, a Pan Am spokesman confirmed the existence of the
memo and that the procedure concerning unaccompanied luggage had
indeed been changed. But he insisted Pan Am did so with the
approval of the FAA.
   Asked if Pan Am allowed unaccompanied bags on flights, the
spokesman, Jeff Kriendler, said: ``Only if the bag had been
X-rayed, as per the approved FAA procedure.''
   ``We did not abandon or eliminate (a procedure), we changed a
procedure with the verbal approval of the FAA,'' he said.
   Kriendler said approval had been given verbally by Ray Salazar,
FAA's director of civil aviation security, at a March 1988 meeting
with security heads of Pan Am and other airlines.
   In Washington, FAA spokesman Bob Buckhorn said he did not know
whether Salazar gave such approval, ``but X-raying baggage is
certainly a security procedure that's acceptable.'' He said Salazar
was out of town.
   All 259 people on board Flight 103 died when it exploded over
Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988. Fiery, falling wreckage
killed 11 on the ground.
   Flight 103 originated at Frankfurt Airport. During a stopover at
London's Heathrow Airport, baggage and passengers were transferred
to a larger aircraft to make the trans-Atlantic crossing to New
York and Detroit.
   Investigators have reconstructed large portions of the Boeing
747, including the forward cargo hold area where the bomb exploded
and the container in which the bomb was loaded.
   The Independent said the first layer of suitcases in the
container belonged to passengers who boarded in London. Bags above
that layer, where the bomb was located, were from connecting
flights, including Frankfurt, it said.
   Scottish police have said the bomb, made of powerful plastic
explosives, was hidden in a radiocassette player. They believe it
either started or passed through the Frankfurt Airport. West German
police have maintained there is not enough evidence to confirm
where the bomb originated.
   The newspaper said FAA regulations prohibit airlines from
loading unaccompanied baggage onto aircraft, even if it has been
X-rayed.
   ``To avoid the time-consuming process of matching up transit
passengers with their baggage and removing the bags of no-show
passengers, Pan Am decided that unaccompanied baggage from feeder
flights could be loaded into aircraft provided it cleared X-ray
checks,'' The Independent said.
   It quoted Daniel Sonesen, then Pan Am's assistant director of
security, as writing in the memo: ``We fixed the problem by
purchasing X-rays. ... In the event of a no-show interline pax
(passenger) ... his bag is load(ed) into the belly (and) we go!!!''
   It quoted the memo as saying Salazar approved the new procedure.
   The newspaper did not say specifically that the person who
checked in the baggage with the bomb failed to board the flight,
only that ``no check was made that the passenger to whom the bomb
bag belonged had in fact boarded the flight.''
   Scottish investigators said in December that Ahmed Jibril's
radical Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestinian-General Command, was one focus of their investigation,
but not the only one.
   They said they were also interested in Mohammed Abu Talb, a
member of another radical Palestinian Group imprisoned in Sweden on
unrelated bombing charges, and other unidentified groups and
individuals.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Finance Committee balked Thursday
at offending U.S. sugar and shoe producers in continuing but not
expanding special trade benefits to Caribbean and Central American
allies.
   Without dissent, the panel approved making permanent former
President Reagan's 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) that
otherwise would expire in 1995.
   However, it rejected amendments by Sens. Bob Packwood, R-Ore.,
and Bill Bradley, D-N.J., that would have reduced by 50 percent the
current tariffs on rubber-sole, canvas-top tennis shoes and
establish a floor on sugar quotas.
   The committee's chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, urged
rejection of the amendments. ``In some ways I'd like to go beyond
what we've done,'' he said, ``but the key is avoiding crippling
controversies.''
   The initiative was intended to lift the region's depressed
economy through a combination of direct aid and an elimination of
tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers to encourage the
development of its exports.
   Excluded from the duty-free importation, however, were textiles,
clothing, luggage, shoes, dinnerware, leather products and other
``sensitive'' goods that compete directly with U.S.-made products.
Special rules also exist for sugar and beef products.
   Critics contend the initiative has failed to a large degree
because U.S. budget deficits have forced a reduction in direct aid
at the same time falling quotas on sugar imports to protect U.S.
producers have constrained the market for the region's single
biggest export product.
   Quotas on allowable sugar imports from the region as well as
other producers such as Australia and the Philippines have fallen
from a total 3.2 million tons the year the initiative was passed to
1.2 million tons last year.
   ``All the benefits (of the initiative) have been lost to the
decline in sugar imports from the quotas,'' said Bradley, whose
amendment would have raised the quota on U.S. sugar imports from
world exporters to 1.6 million tons. It was defeated on a 9-5 vote.
   Packwood's amendment was defeated on a 10-6 vote after Sen. John
Heinz, R-Pa., complained it could cost the jobs of 300 workers at a
plant in his state which assembles tennis shoes.
   Similar legislation was approved by the House last fall.

<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police used batons Thursday to break
up a protest by about 2,000 striking teachers who marched through
this capital city demanding a pay hike, the national news agency
reported.
   The country, which has been hit by a series of strikes in recent
months, is suffering its worst labor unrest since independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   The teachers, who have been on strike since Feb. 19, marched
past the Ministry of Education on Thursday and chanted ``the
teachers want more money!'' the AIM news agency said.
   No injuries or arrests were reported after baton-carrying police
waded into the crowd, AIM said.
   Before the march, the teachers voted to extend their walkout,
despite threats of disciplinary action if they don't return to work
Monday, the news agency reported.
   The teachers want a wage increase of 10 percent to 45 percent,
AIM said.
   The news agency did not say how much they now make. However,
this southeastern African country is one of the poorest in the
world, with many workers earning no more than $40 a month.
   Mozambique's economy has been devastated by a 13-year-old
guerrilla insurgency against the leftist government.

<HEAD>Bill Would Allow Terminally Ill To Tap Life Insurance Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People with less than a year to live could
have tax-free access to their life insurance benefits under
legislation introduced Thursday by Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., and
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
   Dying patients whose doctors have certified they will live less
than 12 months could decide for themselves how best to use the
money to cover high medical, nursing home or other expenses.
   ``This bill is of enormous importance to the families of the
terminally ill and the terminally ill,'' said Bradley. ``I think
it's our obligation to show compassion for them.''
   Bradley said life insurance benefits paid after death are
non-taxable. The proposed legislation would make them non-taxable
before death. He said the bill would protect the Medicaid
eligibility of insured patients who choose not to cash in their
life insurance policy.
   ``We hope to get this passed this year,'' Bradley said.
``There's very little revenue cost. I find it difficult to imagine
there's going to be much opposition to this.''
   Patients with cancer, AIDS or other debilitating diseases who
are forced to leave their jobs could use the proceeds of their
insurance to avoid financial devastation, Lieberman said.
   Given the failure of catastrophic care legislation in Congress
last year, the lawmakers said the measure offers help to some
Americans facing astronomical health costs.
   According to Lieberman, more than 100 million Americans have
life insurance coverage. However, he and Bradley had no estimate of
how many Americans might take advantage of their benefits while
still living.
   Several American insurance firms have begun offering customers
the option of freeing up their life insurance benefits in their
last months.
   The nation's top life insurer, Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, in January began offering policyholders with $25,000
coverage or more the option to use their death benefits at no extra
cost. Newark, N.J.-based Prudential requires allows them access to
the coverage if a doctor certifies they have only six months or
less to live.
   According to Joe Vecchione, a Prudential spokesman, 26 states
have approved Prudential's living benefits coverage since it went
into effect Jan. 26.
   Connecticut Mutual also has a living benefits policy, Lieberman
said.
   Rep. Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., has introduced similar
legislation in the House.

<HEAD>Serbian Leader in Kosovo Calls for Uprising Against Ethnic
Albanians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential leader of the
minority Serbs in troubled Kosovo province has called for an armed
uprising against the majority ethnic Albanians, newspaper reports
said Thursday.
   The daily Borba said Bogdan Kecman, leader of an organization of
Kosovo Serbs called Bozur, told a rally Wednesday that Serbs should
``arm themselves and get ready for the decisive battle'' against
ethnic Albanians.
   About 3,000 Serbs who attended the rally in the provincial
capital of Pristina ``greeted Kecman's speech with wild applause,''
Borba said.
   Kosovo has been the scene of a decade of open strife between
ethnic Albanians, who represent 90 percent of the region's 1.9
million population, and Serbs, who claim they are being driven out
of their homeland.
   Kecman reportedly said that Yugoslavia's president, Janez
Drnovsek, should resign for what he called a failure to protect
Serb interests in Kosovo.
   Kosovo Serbs ``will no longer tolerate enemies of any sort,''
Kecman was quoted as saying. He is highly popular among Serbs in
the province.
   Tensions remain high in Kosovo, where at east 60 ethnic
Albanians have died in violent clashes with security forces since
March of last year.
   The violence flared when Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic,
changed its constitution a year ago, giving it nearly total control
of Kosovo. The province already had been administratively part of
Serbia.
   Serbian authorities claimed the changes were necessary to
protect Kosovo Serbs from alleged harassment by ethnic Albanians.
   Also Thursday, the first political negotiations between the
ethnic Albanian opposition and Serbian independent groups ended in
the central Yugoslav town of Mostar with an appeal to federal
authorities to start withdrawing troops from the province.
   The appeal also urged Kosovo citizens to refrain from
demonstrations and strikes.
   A spokesman for the organizers in Mostar said Serbian
authorities failed to show up at the meeting despite earlier
pledges that they would come.
   Serbia's leadership and Kosovo Serbs previously have rejected
any talks with ethnic Albanian opposition movements, claiming their
leaders are separatists who want the province to secede from
Yugoslavia and join neighboring Albania.

<HEAD>Macheteros Leader Lauds U.S. Columnist for Opposing Statehood</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nationalist leader said Thursday
that conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan was right in opposing
statehood for Puerto Rico even though it's for ``racist'' reasons.
   Filiberto Ojeda Rios, self-proclaimed leader of the clandestine
Macheteros nationalist movement, said Buchanan was correct in
believing that ``if we become a state, a new Northern Ireland will
spring up here.''
   ``This man is right when he says that if statehood sees the day,
there will be a revolution in Puerto Rico,'' Ojeda Rios said on a
radio talk show.
   The Irish Republican Army is struggling to expel British troops
from Northern Ireland, a British colony.
   In a column published in the Washington Times and other
newspapers this week, Buchanan wrote that he opposed statehood for
the Spanish-speaking U.S. commonwealth, saying it would ``convert
us into a bilingual nation.'' He said it would be impossible to
impose English on Puerto Ricans.
   Buchanan's article appeared in Spanish on Wednesday in the San
Juan daily El Mundo.
   A vote has been set for June 1991 giving Puerto Ricans a choice
among independence, statehood, or more autonomy.
   The United States took control of Puerto Rico at the end of the
Spanish American War in 1898. The Caribbean island's commonwealth
status allows the island largely to govern itself.
   Ojeda Rios said that while Buchanan ``objectively'' described
what would happen if the island became the 51st state, he also said
Buchanan ``is a racist who can't see Puerto Rico as part of the
United States because of his racist and discriminatory mentality.''
   Ojeda Rios is one of 19 people charged in connection with the
1983 robbery of $7 million from a Wells Fargo depot in Hartford,
Conn. He is free on bail awaiting trial in Connecticut.
   The Macheteros claimed responsibility for several bombings and
other attacks on U.S. government installations on the island during
the 1970s and early 1980s.

Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military-style boot camps used in 14 states as
an alternative punishment for lawbreakers are not suitable for the
federal prison system, its top official said Thursday.
   Only about 60 of the more than 54,000 federal prisoners fit the
criteria most states use for placing offenders in boot camp, said
J. Michael Quinlan, director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
   However, Quinlan told a Senate subcommittee the federal system
was developing a prototype Intensive Confinement Program that would
expose selected inmates to a highly structured environment as in
boot camp.
   He also voiced qualified support for the camps on the state
level but only as alternatives to probation, parole and other forms
of punishment that don't involve incarceration.
   They should not replace imprisonment for criminals who should be
behind bars and should not be considered a tool for reducing prison
crowding, he said.
   ``Most offenders sentenced to prison should be there to enhance
public safety,'' Quinlan said. A Justice Department study found
that 95 percent of state prisoners were violent criminals or repeat
offenders, while the rest were either burglars or drug traffickers,
he said.
   The Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government
Management conducted the hearing to explore the feasibility of boot
camp in the federal prison system and of lending federal assistance
to state camps.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the panel's chairman, said the camps
could prove especially useful in preventing youthful offenders from
becoming hardened criminals.
   ``Prisons are too often nothing but graduate schools of crime,
releasing young offenders who are even more violent and anti-social
than when they entered prison,'' he said. ``Boot camps are a chance
to break that cycle.''

<HEAD>Diplomat Debunks Notion That Cuba Will Fall</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba's top diplomat in the United States
dismissed on Thursday suggestions his homeland will undergo an
anti-communist upheaval similar to the one in Eastern Europe.
   Jose Arbesu, head of the Cuban Interests Section, said in a rare
public appearance that unlike Eastern Europe, Cuba's revolution was
home grown and was not ``imposed from abroad.''
   Cuba also differs from Eastern Europe because it faced social,
economic and political problems that were created as a result of
``57 years of governments allied to North American (U.S.)
monopolies,'' he said.
   ``The conditions of poverty, illiteracy and desperation which
were products of the colonial relations meant that the only way to
overturn those conditions was to become the owners of our own
resources,'' Arbesu added.
   He spoke to a gathering on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Center
for Development Policy, a liberal research group.
   Arbesu, a veteran of numerous postings abroad, has headed the
Cuban mission in this country since last spring. The United States
and Cuba have not had full diplomatic relations since 1961 and deal
with each other instead through the so-called interests sections.
   Arbesu said the revolution has raised life expectancy, lowered
infant mortality and has a solid record in the war against
illiteracy and in cultural development, benefits which are
universal and free of charge.
   ``All of this was made possible because our economy has
developed despite a 28-year blockade, and because of the political
will of the Cuban people,'' he said. ``What other countries in the
Third World can exhibit such achievements?''
   Although Cuba is aware that ``very serious'' difficulties could
lie ahead, he said, there has been no change in Cuba's economic and
commercial relations with the Soviet Union.
   According to U.S. estimates, Cuba receives more than $6 billion
in various forms of assistance from the Soviet Union. U.S.
officials also have said that the Soviets no longer provide Cuba
with surplus oil for resale to other importing countries for cash,
a profitable business for Cuba in the mid-1980's.
   Arbesu made no reference to Cuba's criticism of Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program, highlighting instead continued
Soviet-Cuban cooperation.
   As an example, he said the two countries agreed recently to add
$250 million worth of new staples into commercial exchange.
   ``We have had and now maintain fraternal relations with the
Soviet Union based on friendship and cooperation,'' he said. ``Our
exchanges have been just, but they have not developed on the basis
of begging or charity, nor without giving anything in return, nor
conditioned on the political or ideological behavior of the Cuban
revolution, as it has been portrayed here.''
   Under questioning, Arbesu rejected the suggestion that the
defeat of Nicaragua's leftist government _ a close ally of Cuba's
for years _ will have a major impact on the island.
   He said the Cuban revolution survived for almost 20 years before
the Sandinistas came to power in Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
   The prime minister of Benin appealed
to striking workers Thursday to go back to their jobs as he took up
a 10-month mandate to bring democracy and economic stability to his
West African nation.
   Benin state radio, monitored in Abidjan, reported that Prime
Minister Nicephore Soglo promised to pay government workers who
received none of their salaries in January and February. The
workers began strikes and protests that helped force President
Mathieu Kerekou to relinquish power Wednesday.
   Kerekou, a brigadier general who seized power in a 1972 coup,
remains head of state and chief of the armed forces.
   But at a national conference of leaders, he was stripped of his
post as defense minister, and Soglo was named to head a new
transitional government and organize democratic elections in
January 1991. None of Kerekou's aides are allowed to sit on the new
Cabinet.
   Kerekou said he agreed to step aside ``in the national interest
and for the greater interest of the people of Benin.''
   There was no indication Thursday how workers were reacting to
Soglo's appeal for them to return to work on Monday, a day before
he is expected to name his advisers and inaugurate the new
government.
   Cotonou Radio said the interim leader had tried to impress on
strike leaders the need for austerity measures imposed in agreement
with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in return
for loans. Benin's economy has been bankrupted by Marxist-Leninist
economics.
   Benin, a former French colony, is one of the world's poorest
nations with a per capita income of $310 and a foreign debt of
nearly $1 billion.
   Western economists say Kerekou's efforts to impose centralized
controls hampered economic growth. Austerity measures introduced
since Kerekou was forcd to negotiate with the International
Monetary Fund in 1986 have failed to revive the shattered economy.

<TEXT>
   Five members of a ``skinhead'' group were found
guilty Thursday of racially motivated hate crimes against Jews,
blacks and Hispanics, acts the U.S. attorney general called
``simply intolerable in a free society.''
   An all-white federal court jury deliberated for about four hours
before convicting all five men of two counts of conspiring to
violate the civil rights of minorities.
   The five vandalized a Jewish synagogue and harassed blacks and
Hispanics at a Dallas park. Former skinhead members testified that
the group, known as the Confederate Hammerskins, had planned to
pump poison gas into the temple.
   Prosecutors characterized the trial as the government's first
major assault against white supremacist groups. The term
``skinheads'' refers to the short-cropped hair worn by members to
show unity.
   Each of the charges carries up to 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders said the
earliest possible sentencing date would be April 19. All five
remained in custody.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh vowed further prosecutions of
hate crimes, saying ``acts of racial and religious hate, such as
those disclosed by the evidence in Dallas, are simply intolerable
in a free society.''
   ``Let the word go out that the federal government intends to
bring to bear the full force of the law on every such act that
comes to its attention,'' Thornburgh said in a statement.
   The trial drew attention from such groups as the New York-based
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which called the verdict
``a major victory in the continuing battle against hate-inspired
violence by skinheads around the country.''
   ``The average American is fed up with racist ignorance,'' said
Richard Dockery, director of the southwest office of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``We have people tired of being afraid to live in their own
homes,'' Dockery said. ``They have to lock themselves up in their
homes live like animals. They can't walk the streets, they can't
use their parks.''
   The defendants were Jon Lance Jordan, 19, of Garland; Sean
Christian Tarrant, 20, and Daniel Alvis Wood, 20, of Dallas;
Michael Lewis Lawrence, 22, of Tulsa, Okla.; and Christopher Barry
Greer, 25, of Irving.
   A third count of the indictment charged Wood, Lawrence and
Jordan with firearms violations. Lawrence was cleared of the
firearms charge; Wood and Jordan were convicted.
   Wood already has been sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined
$5,000 by a state judge for spraying swastikas and anti-Semitic
slogans on the synagogue, Temple Shalom in north Dallas.
   Rabbi Kenneth Roseman, whose Temple Shalom was vandalized,
praised the jury's verdict, but added, ``Just because five people
have been convicted, doesn't mean there aren't more radicals and
bigots around.''
   On Wednesday, Justice Department prosecutor Barry Kowalski urged
jurors ``to tell these five men they can't conspire and stalk
Dallas like racist spirits in the night.''
   Defense attorneys countered that the men were being tried for
their beliefs and suggested witnesses who testified against them
were doing so only to escape prosecution. They said their clients
had a right to exercise free speech even if their beliefs are
unpopular.
   Another group, the Non-Racist Skinheads of Dallas-Fort Worth,
showed up Thursday to congratulate Kolwalski, the prosecutor. The
group claims to be opposed to the Nazi skinheads.

<HEAD>Senate Leaders, Bush, Compromise on Pollution Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders and President Bush compromised
Thursday on future air pollution controls for automobiles,
factories and electric power plants, enhancing chances that a clean
air bill will pass this year.
   The agreement, after more than three weeks of closed-door
negotiations, was viewed as a middle ground likely to attract
enough support to thwart continuing regional opposition in the
looming Senate debate.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the compromise
a ``sound and comprehensive'' agreement that will substantially
improve air quality over the next decade. He planned to bring the
legislation to the Senate floor on Monday.
   ``President Bush is extraordinarily pleased with the agreement.
It is a milestone, an enormous step forward,'' said Roger Porter,
the president's chief domestic policy adviser.
   Porter said the administration would attempt to expedite Senate
passage and seek a similar agreement in the House, where clean-air
legislation remains in committee.
   But the compromise is still likely to encounter stiff industry
lobbying, largely because of its estimated $20 billion to $40
billion annual cost to the economy.
   Both industrial and environmental groups issued statements
Thursday denouncing the compromise.
   Some senators also have expressed concern that the bargaining
weakened provisions in the original Senate bill that would have
required stronger automobile emission controls to combat urban
smog. Other have voiced continued concern about the impact of acid
rain controls.
   ``The agreement fails to require the controls we need to provide
clean air in the nation and in New Jersey,'' said Sen. Frank
Lautenberg, D-N.J., who participated in some of the private
discussions, but said he would not support the compromise on the
Senate floor.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, called the
compromise ``a giant step forward'' in revising federal air
pollution laws for the first time in 13 years. But he cautioned
that many senators likely will seek changes when the measure goes
to the Senate floor.
   He urged Mitchell ``not to handcuff anyone'' during the floor
action by rushing to cut off debate.
   The agreement made some accommodations to regional interests,
especially those concerned about the local economic cost of acid
rain controls.
   On that score, the compromise continues to require a 10 million
ton annual reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions, but allows
Midwest utilities to achieve extra credits and allowances that
could be sold to other utilities to recoup some of the costs.
Plants that use new technology _ instead of switching away from
high-sulfur coal to another fuel _ could delay compliance for two
years would receive additional credits for early cuts in emissions,
provisions designed to help West Virginia's coal industry.
   About a dozen senators from the Midwest had threatened to
filibuster the legislation if some accommodation were not met to
ease their concerns about the high costs of the pollution controls.
   Mitchell said he still could not discount the threat of a
filibuster, but various Senate sources suggested that with the
compromise, Mitchell likely would have enough votes to halt debate.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he would seek additional changes
to the bill. But ``I'm not going to engage in any filibuster,'' he
said.
   ``We did not have a choice between the good, the bad and the
ugly. We had a choice between ugly, uglier and ugliest,'' said Sen.
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., who during the private talks sought to
work out provisions to ease the plight of Midwest utilities that
rely heavily on high-sulfur coal.
   The breakthrough on the legislation came Wednesday when leaders
agreed on pollution curbs on automobiles.
   The compromise eliminates an automatic second round of auto
tailpipe controls, although such measures could be put into effect
if more than 11 of 27 cities with ``serious'' ozone pollution
problems fail to meet federal air quality standards at the end of
this decade.
   The White House had strongly opposed the second round of
controls, as had the auto industry. But environmentalists, state
pollution control officials in areas with the dirtiest air, and
some senators argued the second round of controls are needed to
deal with smog in such areas as southern California and the
Northeast.
   In the final days of negotiations, an agreement also came on the
acid rain provision, after senators from the West were assured that
the utility emission controls would allow for future growth in
electric capacity and some accommodation was made to the Midwest
region.
   Earlier tentative agreements were struck on how to curb toxic
and smog-causing emissions from industrial plants.
   Under the compromise, industrial plants will have to use the
best available technology to curb releases of 192 toxic chemicals
including carcinogens, or cancer-causing agents. Early in the next
decade a ``health standard'' would require plants to reduce
emissions further, if the cancer risk to nearby residents is still
too high.
   A broad range of industries and businesses also would have to
comply with tougher controls on smog-causing emissions. The
compromise, however, would exempt thousands of smaller polluters,
which would have been covered by the original Senate bill.
   Environmental groups, meanwhile, chastised the negotiations and
said the compromise agreement severely weakened the original Senate
bill.
   ``The back-room dealing has generated bad deals for the American
people,'' complained Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean
Air Coalition.
   But industry did not like the agreement either.
   The Edison Electric Institute called the agreement
``unnecessarily costly'' for the nation's utilities. The Chemical
Manufacturers Association called the tougher controls on toxic
chemicals too stringent and politically motivated and ignoring
scientific facts about health risks.
   The agreement is ``far from what business and industry would
consider acceptable,'' said William Fay, administrator of the Clean
Air Working Group, industry's umbrella lobbying organization on
clean air issues.
   ``There's no question the bill has been improved but there are
still some real problems,'' said Helen Petrauskas, vice president
for environmental engineering at Ford Motor Co.
   Though the bill avoids any requirement that automakers sell a
specific number of cars that burn clean fuels, which favors
industry, the exhaust standards are still tougher than the industry
would like, she said.

   The Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant
won federal permission Thursday to produce commercial electricity
after two decades of protests and legal struggles that made it a
symbol of the national anti-nuclear movement.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 3-0 to grant a license
for Seabrook to operate at full power but delayed issuing it for
two weeks _ to allow an expected appeal in federal court.
   Two of the commission's five members abstained from the vote
because of involvement in Seabrook issues prior to becoming
commissioners.
   Opponents have long maintained that people near the plant would
be trapped in a nuclear emergency, and officials in Massachusetts,
with a border just two miles from Seabrook, said they would indeed
take the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.
   Foes also claimed a broader victory, contending that as a result
of the long fight against Seabrook, no utility would be willing to
risk the monetary and other costs of trying build and open another
nuclear plant.
   The commission's ruling ratified recommendations by its staff
and several lower-level boards that the plant is safe and that
evacuation plans would work.
   ``I would be happy to live within two miles of this plant and I
wouldn't worry about it at all,'' said NRC Chairman Kenneth Carr.
   However, Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon said, ``We
will be in court in the next few days. ... There has never been a
licensing issue which has been so legally vulnerable.''
   Massachusetts officials along with New Hampshire anti-nuclear
groups have coordinated the Seabrook opposition.
   At the white-domed plant overlooking the Atlantic ocean, 75
protesters sang and chanted slogans, and 10 blocked the plant gate
by sitting down in the driveway. When they refused to leave, they
were arrested. Another Seabrook opponent was arrested when he
posted a sign that read ``Shame'' over one posted by plant workers
reading ``License Approved!''
   At the NRC meeting, utility executives hugged each other after
the ruling while Seabrook opponents said that their fight against
Seabrook had helped stall the nuclear power industry.
   ``I feel great, I'm delighted,'' said Ted Feigenbaum, chief
operating officer of New Hampshire Yankee, the company that
operates Seabrook. ``We will be starting the plant up as soon as
the license is received, no later than March 15.'' He said it would
take two to three months for the 1,150 megawatt plant to reach full
power.
   Feigenbaum said opposition to Seabrook contributed to its
current $6.5 billion price tag, which will be felt by ratepayers in
the Northeast.
   ``We're going to have to deal with this long licensing
process,'' Feigenbaum said. ``It took too long and all this
litigation hasn't added one iota to the safety of the plant.''
   In a New Hampshire news conference, New Hampshire Yankee
President Edward Brown said the NRC decision ``marks the end of a
long, convoluted, challenging licensing battle. For us, the
decision represents a triumph of reason, professionalism,
perseverance and common sense.''
   While opponents had expected Thursday's vote, they said the
losing battle over Seabrook should help win a larger war against
nuclear power.
   ``The price paid to finally secure Seabrook's license has been
so great that no utility will ever again be willing to risk the
high economic costs, the bad public relations and the protracted
political fight necessary to bring a nuclear power plant on line,''
said Ken Bossong of Public Citizen, one of several groups opposed
to Seabrook.
   In the mid-1970s during construction of the plant, thousands of
anti-nuclear protesters flocked to Seabrook and hundreds were
arrested in acts of civil disobedience. The protests picked up
again last summer as the plant drew closer to a full-power license.
   The Seabrook construction period was marked by a sharp decline
in public and investor support for nuclear power. According to
Public Citizen _ a private group active on many issues and opposed
to nuclear power _ 111 U.S. reactor orders were canceled and 11
operating plants were retired during Seabrook's construction. NRC
Chairman Carr noted that there are no new applications for nuclear
plants before the commission and an NRC spokesman said the last
request was filed in 1978.
   The licensing decision comes at a time when New England faces
acute energy problems marked recently by the skyrocketing price of
home heating oil and, in the past several summers, a shortage of
electricity during heat waves. Seabrook can produce enough
electricity to power a million New England homes.
   Seabrook has been plagued by financial troubles, a situation
that opponents say could affect plant safety.
   First conceived in 1968, Seabrook was to have been a
twin-reactor power plant costing $1 billion. By 1986, with one
reactor ready to operate, the partially completed second reactor
was mothballed. Since then the cost has continued to climb.
   Northeast Utilities of Berlin, Conn., is awaiting final state
and federal approval of a $2.3 billion buyout of Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, which owns 36 percent of Seabrook, the
largest single share.
   Public Service, which could not collect any of the cost of
Seabrook from customers until it started generating electricity,
sought court protection from creditors under under federal
bankruptcy laws in 1988, the first private utility to do so since
the Great Depression.
   Opponents also have argued that there are, as yet, no long-term
plans on what to do with the nuclear waste Seabrook would produce.
But Carr dismissed that concern.
   ``The disposal of radioactive waste is not a technical
problem,'' Carr said. ``It is a political problem.''

   Soldiers patrolled the north Indian town
of Meham Thursday, the flashpoint of election violence that left 13
people dead in Meham and a total of at least 98 dead nationwide,
police and news reports said.
   Incomplete results showed former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
Congress Party losing heavily in elections Tuesday to eight state
legislatures and the governing National Front coalition and its
electoral ally, the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, making
major gains.
   Besides Wednesday's deaths in Haryana state's Meham
constituency, at least 80 people were killed Tuesday in eastern
Bihar state during voting for state assemblies and by-elections and
others died in Gujarat and Maharashtra states.
   Rival supporters fought pitched battles in Meham on Wednesday
when another vote was ordered in some balloting centers following
allegations of electoral fraud.
   A police spokesman in Chandigarh, the state capital, said three
people died in the fighting and 10 were killed when police fired to
control rioting mobs.
   Voting was suspended and the army was called out to keep the
peace, said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules.
   Newspapers blamed Om Prakash Chauthala, Haryana state's chief
minister, for most of the vote fraud in Meham. He was running for
the Haryana state assembly from the Meham district.
   ``Armed gangs were seen moving from booth to booth in the chief
minister's constituency and getting the ballot papers stamped in
his favor,'' The Hindu newspaper said.
   Voting results indicated the Congress Party was being voted out
of power in at least five of the eight states where elections were
held this week.
   United News of India said the National Front and Bharatiya
Janata Party won most of the seats in Orissa, Madhya Pradesh,
Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan states and were set to form
governments, either in tandem or singly.
   Complete results from Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra
states were not expected until Friday.
   United News said the National Front and Bharatiya Janata won 702
of 996 results announced so far, and Congress 197. Left-wing groups
and independents took the other seats.
   In all, 1,610 seats were at stake and Congress put up candidates
in all but 30 races. The National Front and Bharatiya Janata each
fielded about 1,000 candidates, agreeing to ``friendly contests''
in some constituencies.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Program to Encourage Volunteers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate approved a $125 million program of
grants Thursday to encourage volunteer work ranging from fighting
illiteracy to cleanup drives in the nation's forests, woods and
parks.
   ``The basic idea is to challenge young people and old people
alike to give something back to america for all that its given to
them,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said as the Senate
approved the measure, 78-19.
   The measure would authorize $125 million for volunteer programs
through the end of the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
   It would earmark $25 million for school-based programs,
involving teachers aides, tutoring and the teaching of reading. It
also would provide $35 million for a youth service corps, involving
park and forest cleanup programs for volunteers 16 to 25 years old.
   A program for individuals 17 and older would focus on service in
education, environment, public safety and other fields, and would
be authorized to receive $25 million.
   Also authorized would be a $25 million Points of Light
Foundation sought by Republicans in keeping with President Bush's
campaign remark that the needy in America would be helped through
volunteer efforts from ``a thousand points of light.'' The
foundation would encourage volunteerism.
   States would bid for grants under the plan. The money would be
distributed by a $4 million Commission on National and Community
Service to be established under the bill.
   All the money would have to be appropriated in annual bills, and
the appropriations could be less that the amounts authorized, which
act as ceilings on appropriations.
   The bill was a slimmed-down version of the legislation that
initially went into the hopper.
   It took Kennedy, the bill's floor manager, four days to shoehorn
it through a balky Senate as lawmakers kept attempting to pile on
amendments, some unrelated to volunteerism.
   The longest fight came over a proposed amendment sponsored by
Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., to allow Big Brothers and other
volunteer groups in the District of Columbia to bar homosexuals
from activities involving minors.
   After hours of wrangling, the Senate adopted a Kennedy
substitute which would allow volunteer groups to bar homosexuals if
they had been convicted of a crime or were currently charged with
one.
   ``It's just plain wrong for any arm of government to force
private volunteer groups to unite adult homosexuals with minors as
companions and role models,'' Armstrong said later.
   Lawmakers sought to attach provisions concerning the Nicaraguan
elections and the repression of dissent in China.
   Liberals praised the bill as one that would usher in a new
spirit among Americans. ``What we do in this bill is begin to get
away from the values of Wall Street and go back to the values of
Main Street, of neighbor helping neighbor,'' said Sen. Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md.,
   Some volunteers would receiving living allowances and other
stipends as well as education and housing benefits.
   As the final vote neared, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., took the
floor to condemn the notion of paying volunteers. ``A young person
has got to feel like a chump if he's not paid under this bill.''
   He said benefits paid to some volunteers under the program,
including living allowances and health insurance, were ``not in
keeping with the spirit of volunteerism.''
   He also warned against expansion of the program, citing a danger
that the Senate would ``beget some broad programs, perhaps some
very broad programs, that are going to cost millions, perhaps
billions, each year.''

<HEAD>Expert Agrees Hazelwood Should Not Have Tried to Move Tanker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Hazelwood's efforts to move the
grounded Exxon Valdez off a reef was reckless because the skipper
was not ``dead certain'' of his ship's location, a marine salvage
expert testifed Thursday.
   But William Milwee Jr., of Portland, Ore., acknowledged under
heated cross examination that no matter what Hazelwood had done
after the ship grounded, the Exxon Valdez could not have moved
anywhere.
   ``There is absolutely no question this ship would not have moved
using its engines alone,'' said Milwee.
   ``No matter what Capt. Hazelwood did?'' asked defense attorney
Michael Chalos.
   ``No matter what Capt. Hazelwood did,'' responded the witness,
``but Capt. Hazelwood did nothing to try and determine that.''
   Milwee said Hazelwood should have taken ``soundings'' to
determine exactly how solidly his ship lay aground on Bligh Reef.
But he conceded on cross examination that such ``soundings,'' in
which a lead line is dropped over the side of a vessel, might not
have been accurate because of the amount of oil in the water around
the ship.
   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, spilled nearly 11 million
gallons of Alaska crude oil within the hour after it ran aground in
Prince William Sound. It was the nation's worst oil spill, killing
countless birds, fish and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of
miles of rocky shoreline.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is on trial charged with
criminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors, reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil. He could face 7\ years in prison and fines of
$61,000.
   A key element in the charges against him is recklessness, about
which each of the prosecution expert witnesses was asked. Milwee
was the second witness in a row to say he considered Hazelwood's
actions as meeting the legal criteria for being reckless by
consciously disregarding ``a substantial and unjustifiable risk.''
   There has been dispute at Hazelwood's trial over whether the
skipper, by maneuvering the ship forward, risked capsizing it or
causing further damage to its gashed underbelly. Milwee and another
prosecution expert witness, Robert Beevers, said Hazelwood did the
wrong thing. But Beevers acknowledged before leaving the stand that
no additional damage occurred because of Hazelwood's efforts.
   Milwee, a former Navy salvage expert who now works as a
consultant, insisted that Hazelwood should have tried to secure the
ship on the reef if he was unsure of the extent of the grounding.
   ``If you try to re-float her there is a chance of doing
additional damage,'' he said. He added that Hazelwood's actions
after the grounding were consistent with trying to get the ship off
the rocks.
   ``You shouldn't attempt to move a ship in any way until you have
knowledge of the water that lies around it,'' he said, stressing
that his advice to a captain in such a situation is: ``Find out
what you've got.''
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole asked the witness how
certain a captain should be of a situation before he attempts
refloating.
   ``Dead certain,'' said the witness.
   But on cross examination by Chalos, Milwee was confronted by a
reference book that he himself had used in preparing his opinions.
The book contained 14 points of advice for action by captains of
grounded ships.
   As Chalos read off each of these suggestions, the witness
acknowledged that Hazelwood had done almost all of the recommended
procedures, including alerting the engine room, lowering lifeboats,
sending a distress message and calling for tugs to stand by.
   On each of the points, Chalos asked him: ``Was that a correct
action?''
   ``Correct action,'' answered the witness.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leftist guerrilla group declared a
unilateral truce Thursday to allow peaceful balloting in March
national elections, and a radio report said two other important
rebel groups would soon follow.
   The People's Liberation Army, a Maoist group, said in a
communique it would refrain from any attacks until April 1.
   A spokesman read the communique over a crackling telephone line
during a live radio broadcast by the Caracol network. Caracol did
not say from where the broadcast orginated.
   Caracol, citing informed sources, said two other groups, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation
Army, also would declare unilateral cease-fires in the coming days.
   The total estimated strength of the three groups is 5,000 to
10,000 armed rebels. Estimates by security forces of the total
number of armed insurgents in Colombia vary from 10,000 to 20,000.
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, is the
country's largest guerrilla group with an estimated 5,000 armed
members. It recently declared its willingness to negotiate a truce
if the government changes the constitution to allow more political
participation.
   The National Liberation Army is led by a defrocked priest and
inspired by the teachings of Fidel Castro. Unlike FARC, it has said
it will never negotiate with the government and has carried out a
number of attacks in recent weeks in an effort to disrupt
legislative and municipal elections to be held March 11.
   Meanwhile, army troops killed six leftist guerillas belonging to
FARC in gunbattles late Wednesday near the northeastern towns of
Labranzagrande and Arauca, police said.
   Also Wednesday, National Liberation Army guerrillas attacked the
northern towns of Banco and Tamalamequito in an effort to pressure
residents not to vote, the Magdalena state police said. The
administrator of Banco's airport was killed in the attack.
   In the cocaine capital of Medellin, dynamite attacks Wednesday
against four energy company facilities left 30 percent of the
city's residents without electricity, local officials said.
   A group calling itself the Popular Militiamen telephoned local
radio stations to claim responsibility for the attacks, which they
said were in response to a recent increase in the city's
electricity rates.
   In another sign of escalating political tension, officials of
the Patriotic Union Party said several men wearing military
uniforms painted death threats against party members on walls in
Segovia, a town 265 miles north of Bogota.
   A group calling itself Death to Revolutionaries of the Northeast
left a message in the mayor's office threatening to kill him and
other local party leaders if they did not leave town within three
days, Caracol reported.
   Patriotic Union officials have blamed right-wing death squads
for Monday's assassination of the mayor of the northern town of
Apartado, also a member of the Marxist-oriented party.
   The party leaders also blamed the death squads for the killings
this week of six other party members, a freelance journalist and
three leaders of an agricultural cooperative.
   The party's president, Diego Montana, said 72 members have been
assassinated so far this year.
   Earlier this week, party leaders demanded the dismissal of
Defense Minister Oscar Botero and three army brigade commanders,
accusing them of responsibility for waging an ``extermination
campaign'' against the leftist party.
   President Virgilio Barco said the allegations would be
investigated, but suggested the accusations might be an attempt by
the party to gain sympathy among voters before the elections.

   President Bush and his predecessor Ronald
Reagan disagreed in a social chat Thursday on when the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua should disarm.
   The disparity cropped up when Bush stopped in to visit Reagan at
his Los Angeles office.
   The former president was asked by reporters during a photo
session if the Contras should lay down their arms now that the
Nicaraguans have ousted Sandinista President Daniel Ortega in their
elections.
   Reagan replied, ``Don't you think it might be time enough for us
to wait and make sure that there is a civilian government in place
in Nicaragua, because the Sandinistas had their arms and their
weapons long before any Nicaraguan citizens picked up arms and
became the Contras?''
   Reagan's administration built the Contras from a handful of
stragglers into a force of some 12,000 fighters.
   Both Ortega and the U.S.-backed candidate who beat him, Violeta
Chamorro, have also demanded the Contras lay down arms.
   Bush earlier Thursday said he was confident the Contras would
disarm. Asked if he was directly calling on them to do so, he told
a news agency reporter, ``Yes. Put it on the wire.''
   As Bush sat next to Reagan in the former president's highrise
suite in the Century City offfice neighborhood, reporters asked
Bush if he concurred with Reagan's comment.
   Bush said he had already expressed himself on the subject, and
then fell back on his sometime rule of declining to answer
questions at photo sessions.
   Reporters asked Reagan to elaborate on whether he believes the
Contras should stay together until Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration on
April 25, as the Contras have said they want to do.
   ``Well, I don't know whether to wait that long or not, but
things could take place foreshadowing what the situation would be
earlier than that,'' Reagan replied. He did not explain further
what he meant.
   Bush, as Reagan's vice president for eight years, endorsed the
policy of providing the Contras military assistance.
   Reagan gave videotape testimony last week in the trial of his
natiojnal security adviser, John Poindexter, who is charged with
obstructing congressional inquiries into the Iran-Contra diversion
of profits to the Contras from arms sales to Iran.
   Bush broke last year with his predecessor's military-oriented
policy on Nicaragua, endorsing a diplomatic solution, and the
regional peace process that led to last week's election.
   Contra officials initially said they would not give up until
Mrs. Chamorro takes office, because the Sandinistas still control
the nation's large military and police forces.
   They have since said they will hold talks with Mrs. Chamorro on
their conditions for disarming.
   Bush administration officials have said since the election that
there is no longer any reason for fighting, and the Sandinistas
announced a unilateral cease-fire.
   When Bush refused to answer reporters' questions, Reagan said
his successor was ``doing exactly what is right for him. Just have
a little more freedom now.''
   Bush laughed, leaned over and touched Reagan's arm and said,
``We have a slight difference in policy.''
   Bush's visit with Reagan was purely a social call, said press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The two sat on couches in front of windows looking out on a
skyscraper view of the city.
   A plate of assorted cookies was on the glass coffee table in
front of them.

   A former Justice Department prosecutor told
congressional investigators the FBI instructed him to drop his
investigation of CIA links to failed savings institutions, a House
subcommittee chairman said Thursday.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House Banking
subcommittee on financial institutions, said staff aides, following
up allegations published by The Houston Post, interviewed the
former prosecutor twice.
   The prosecutor ``told the staff that while pursuing a bank
failure investigation, he was told by FBI agents to drop the
investigation of one of the individuals connected with the bank
failure because that individual had `CIA connections,''' Annunzio
said in a letter to Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, chairman of the
House Intelligence Committee.
   ``The prosecutor was also told that the individual involved had
a `get out of jail free' card,'' Annunzio said.
   One of the FBI agents present confirmed the prosecutors'
account, the congressman said.
   Annunzio refused to identify the prosecutor.
   Lloyd Monroe, a Brown University researcher who prosecuted bank
fraud cases while with a Justice Department organized crime task
force, was quoted by the Houston newspaper as saying he believes
the CIA masterminded or condoned some S&amp;L fraud.
   Three weeks ago, Annunzio asked CIA Director William Webster to
appear at a closed session of his panel to respond to the
allegations. Webster declined.
   The CIA labeled the allegations ``scurrilous and
unsubstantiated'' and said it would be inappropriate for Webster to
appear before a Banking subcommittee.
   Annunzio asked Beilenson, whose committee has jurisdiction over
the CIA, to investigate.
   ``I do not think a well-respected former Justice Department
prosecutor and a former FBI agent would make up something so
serious as the CIA charges,'' Annunzio said.
   Daniel Childs, director of the intelligence committee staff,
said the staff would conduct a preliminary investigation to
determine if a full-fledged probe is warranted. He said it was too
eqarly to tell if Webster would be asked to testify.

   President Bush said Thursday there are no
talks under way for the release of American hostages in Lebanon but
said he was willing to undertake private or public discussions if
that would win their freedom.
   ``I will do everything I can, privately, openly _ whatever it
takes _ to get them out of there without trading for hostages,''
Bush said.
   He said a spate of recent news reports suggesting movement in
the hostage situation were ``ridiculous stories.''
   ``We're not in the negotiating process,'' Bush said.
   In a brief exchange with reporters, Bush repeatedly denied that
there were any secret discussions under way in Geneva or elsewhere
about the hostages.
   Despite Bush's comments, the sister of one hostage, just back in
New York from an overseas mission on behalf of her brother, said
she was optimistic that the hostages would be released soon.
   ``I assume they're talking as they always have done through
third parties,'' said Peggy Say, referring to the United States
government.
   She is the sister of Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for the Associated Press and the longest-held of the
eight Americans and 10 others held hostage in Lebabon.
   Anderson was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   ``I was reassured traveling throughout Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, there will be a release without conditions. There will
be no ransom. There will be influence by everyone concerned for a
positive conclusion and building bridges,'' she said.
   ``That isn't to say my optimism means there's going to be a
release today or next week or next month.''
   ``The Syrian commitment is 100 percent,'' she said.
   Saying he hoped there would be some movement, Bush said, ``I'd
love to see them release these hostages.''
   The president repeated his exhortation to Iran, which is
believed to have influence over the hostage-takers, that goodwill
will beget goodwill.
   ``And goodwill means releasing kidnapped prisoners,'' Bush said.
``And so that's where it stands.''
   Bush said, ``I don't spend a day that I don't think about the
hostages, but there are no secret talks going on.
   ``And I have read some of the most ridiculous stories, printed
with anonymous sources, failing t do anything other than repeat
rumors.''
   He said he saw one story saying he had talked with French
President Francois Mitterrand about the hostages, and the story was
denied but then cropped up again.
   ``There's something going on that's crazy,'' Bush said,
referring to the stories.
   Bush said he called in Brent Scowcroft, his national security
adviser, after reading stories that talks had been held in Geneva
on the hostages.
   He said he asked Scowcroft, ``Are there any talks, have there
been any, direct, indirect, in Geneva? And he said, `No.'''
   Bush said, ``Now, let me tell you something. If I thought a talk
in Geneva would result in letting people go free, I would undertake
the talk.
   ``And if I thought the way to conduct that talk was to do it
quietly, I would do it in that manner,''he continued. ``If I
thought the best way to get the hostages out were to publicly have
talks in Geneva, I would do that. But there aren't any.''
   Former President Ronald Reagan also was skeptical of the hostage
stories.
   During a meeting with Bush, Reagan was asked by a reporter if he
had any words of caution for the president regarding the hostages.
``Well, the way most leaks turn out, the caution, I think would be,
wait until somebody could prove it,'' Reagan said.
   It was an attempt to win the hostages' freedom that led Reagan
to sell arms to Iran in secret.

<HEAD>Costa Rica Asks for Extradition of American Linked to Bombing</HEAD>

   The Costa Rican government will ask
the United States to extradite John Hull, who has been linked to
the 1984 bombing of a Nicaraguan rebels' news conference in which
four people were killed, a Foreign Ministry source said Thursday.
   The source, who did not want to be identified by name, said the
Costa Rican Embassy in Washington will present the extradition
request on Monday.
   Hull skipped bond and fled to the United States last July after
living 20 years in Costa Rica. He owned a ranch near the Nicaraguan
border and has been accused of having ties to the Reagan
administration and of supplying weapons to the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels.
   Hull, a native of Princeton, Ind., who acquired Costa Rican
citizenship during his years in the Central American country, was
released from a hospital Thursday in Evansville, Ind., where he had
been treated for heart problems. Attempts to reach him in his home
in Patoka, Ind., have not been successful.
   In January, Costa Rican officials accused Hull of responsibility
for a 1984 bombing that resulted in the deaths of three journalists
and a Nicaraguan rebel along the Costa Rican-Nicaraguan border.
   The target of a May 31, 1984, explosion in a house in Penca,
Nicaragua, is believed to have been Eden Pastora, a Contra rebel
commander at the time who had defected from the Sandinista
government.
   Instead, the victims were Linda Frazier, an American reporter,
two Costa Rican journalists attending Pastora's news conference and
the rebel. Pastora and about a dozen other people were injured.
   Hull has called the charges ``politically motivated'' and has
denied involvement with the Contras, drug trafficking and the
bombing.
   The bomb was hidden in a camera case by a man posing as a
photographer who was traveling with a stolen Dutch passport.
   Maximo Esquivel, a judge in northern Costa Rica, was quoted in
Thursday's editions of The New York Times as saying he signed the
extradition order last month. Esquivel's office said the judge
would not make any statement about the matter when The Associated
Press contacted his office by telephone Thursday in Quesada, about
100 miles north of San Jose.
   Prosecutor Jorge Chavarria said that Hull and Felipe Vidal, a
Cuban, planned the bombing to avenge Pastora's statements linking
Hull to the CIA. The whereabouts of Vidal and the man who placed
the bomb have not been determined.
   Hull was jailed last year in Costa Rica, accused of drug
trafficking to help the rebels and of violating Costa Rica's
neutrality, but was released on $37,000 bond and fled to Indiana.
   Before his legal problems, Hull was a wealthy rancher in Costa
Rica's northern San Carlos province. Judge Esquivel's jurisdiction
is in the same province.
   Hull's attorney in Costa Rica, Juan Sobrado, told The Associated
Press by telephone, ``The charges against my client lack
foundation.''
   The lawyer said, ``It's part of a Sandinista design to liquidate
the Contras.''
   Sobrado said that if there is any proof against Hull that he
should be tried in the United States, ``where it would be easy to
show that the accusations are false.''
   ``Hull did not flee Costa Rican justice, only a change in
jurisdiction,'' the attorney added.

   Seabrook nuclear plant workers cheered and
raised a sign proclaiming victory and protesters blocked gates
outside the complex Thursday after the government allowed it to
begin producing power.
   About 125 protesters demonstrated at the three gates to the
plant. By the time the protest ended around 7:30 p.m., about 6{
hours after it began, police had arrested 72 people, including 25
juveniles who were not charged, said town police dispatcher Tarnya
Janvrin.
   The government announcement flashed in the plant's reception
center shortly before noon, said Edward Brown, president of
Seabrook operator New Hampshire Yankee.
   Maintenance workers Richard Young and Earl Chafe had a sign
ready and hoisted it on a billboard. ``Startup '90: We Have the
Power,'' it read.
   ``It's about time,'' said Young, who has worked at the
long-delayed plant for more than a decade.
   The 3-0 Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing vote gave
opponents a stay of up to two weeks to file legal appeals, which
foes have promised. The plant has been the subject of anti-nuclear
protests since before its 1976 groundbreaking.
   Plant spokesman Dave Scanzoni noted that a flurry of appeals in
mid-1989 delayed low-power testing only briefly. ``We expect the
same situation would happen and we'd be producing electricity very
soon,'' he said.
   When news of the approval reached 50 demonstrators outside the
gate, they began singing ``We Shall Overcome.'' Kurt Ehrenberg, a
veteran protester, became the first to be arrested after he walked
through the main gate and posted on a guard shed a sign that read
``Shame'' over one declaring ``License Approved!''
   As protesters chanted slogans, 10 teen-agers sat down in the
driveway to the gate. They were arrested, as were some 20
demonstrators who walked through the gate later.
   Most of the 47 adults arrested were charged with criminal
trespass; two were charged with disorderly conduct and others with
blocking traffic, Janvrin said, reading from a news release.
   As police took Ehrenberg away to book him on a disorderly
conduct charge, he called out, ``I'm not a criminal; the real
criminals are (Gov.) Judd Gregg and the NRC.''
   Gregg, a Republican, called the NRC vote ``a major step forward
in resolving the issue,'' but said the final word will rest with
the federal appeals court.
   ``Should the court affirm this decision, then the final step
will have been made and the plant should be turned on,'' Gregg said
in a statement.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis denounced the NRC action. The
former Democratic presidential candidate had fought licensing on
grounds that communities near Seabrook, including six in his state,
could not be evacuated safely in event of an accident.
   He promised to keep fighting. ``Besides battling in court we
will also encourage congressional investigations ... to hold the
NRC accountable for its actions,'' he said.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher defended Seabrook's federally mandated
emergency plans, which are expected to be the focus of the court
battle.
   ``We haven't just developed plans that are adequate; we've
developed plans that work,'' Sher said this week.
   State Senate Majority Leader Edward Dupont hailed the watershed
vote.
   ``We need the energy from Seabrook,'' said the Republican
lawmaker, a long-time Seabrook supporter. ``I'm very positive that
today is a good day for New Hampshire.''
   In Washington, D.C., Ralph Nader's Public Citizen organization
called licensing a Pyrrhic victory for the nuclear industry.
   ``The price paid to finally secure Seabrook's license has been
so great that no utility will ever again be willing to risk the
high economic costs, the bad public relations and the protracted
political fight necessary to bring a nuclear power plant on line,''
the group said in a statement.
   But Brown said Seabrook's triumph could inject new life into the
nation's dormant nuclear power industry.
   ``Some have called Seabrook Station a bellwether for the future
of the entire nuclear industry in the United States,'' he said. ``I
can't predict if that will be true or not, but if the licensing of
our plant helps to preserve the option of generating electricity by
nuclear power in our country, then I believe we have made a very
important contribution to America's energy future.''

   Peace in Nicaragua apparently has not spilled
over into the United States Senate, where a bitter debate over past
U.S. policy erupted late Thursday and prompted one senator to ask
plaintively, ``Why can't we just shut up for a change?''
   The extended exchange began when conservative Sen. Malcolm
Wallop, R-Wyo., offered a non-binding resolution congratulating
opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro on her Sunday election
victory and insisting that the current leftist government of Daniel
Ortega turn over all power, including the military, to her.
   Wallop's resolution called ``deplorable'' an Ortega assertion
that his party would continue to ``govern from below'' and said it
was a violation of his commitment to abide by the results of the
election.
   Chamorro ``won it all. She'll be the president of the army, the
police and the people,'' said Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat from the opposite
end of the ideological spectrum, then rose to offer a different
version, one that included mention of Costa Rican President Oscar
Arias' role in starting regional peace negotiations.
   But debate soon ranged far from that topic. Senators got bogged
down in an argument over which was most responsible for Nicaragua's
free elections: former President Reagan's policy of arming the
anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, or Arias' 1987 peace initiative.
   ``To suggest that the Contra aid program would have produced the
events on Sunday is ludicrous on its face,'' Dodd argued.
   Then Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who had been an official
observer in Nicaragua on Sunday, came to the floor shaking his head.
   ``I can't believe my ears. The best conceivable outcome has
taken place in Nicaragua, and we are keeping the battle alive in
the Senate.''
   His voice growing louder, Danforth added: ``Cool it! Cool the
rhetoric! Why can't we just shut up for a change? ... Why do we
have to rub it in with Ortega? Why do we have to reach over there
and tweak his nose?''
   Passions finally cooled when the two sides agreed to withdraw
the resolutions and enter what Wallop called ``some negotiations in
good faith'' to work out a compromise.
   On a voice vote later in the evening, the Senate passed a
resolution commending the Nicaraguan people ``for their recent
successfully held election.''
   The resolution called for ``a spirit of reconciliation by all
parties and for a peaceful transition of power.''

<HEAD>Philippines' Enrile Says Charges Against Him Are Lies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with new complaint filed against
Enrile, other. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile
dismissed as a ``total fabrication'' on Thursday charges that he
aided a failed coup against President Corazon Aquino.
   Officials also filed a new complaint against Enrile, claiming he
misappropriated funds during the administration of the late
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Enrile, 66, was among seven people indicted Tuesday in
connection with the failed coup last December. He is the most
prominent figure charged in any of the six coup attempts against
Mrs. Aquino.
   When he was defense minister in February 1986, Enrile turned
against Marcos and led the military mutiny that drove Marcos into
Hawaiian exile, where he died, and swept Mrs. Aquino into office.
Enrle was fired as defense chief in November 1986 after his
followers tried to overthrow the new government.
   At a news conference Thursday at a suburban police headquarters
where he was in detention, Enrile said the charges of ``rebellion
with murder'' were phony and were meant to harass him for opposing
Mrs. Aquino. He is the country's lone opposition senator.
   ``Do you think that now that I am in detention, the Aquino
government will be stable? I don't think so,'' Enrile said. ``Mrs.
Aquino will find out that her case is based on nothing else but
lies.''
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus defended the arrest. He said it
will not damage the country's image abroad because because it shows
the Aquino government is determined to tackle internal problems.
   Enrile's lawyer, Renato Cayetano, said Thurday he will ask a
lower court handling the charges to defer arraignment pending a
Supreme Court decision on his client's petition for freedom.
Arraignment has been set for Monday.
   The senator's lawyers, who include two former Supreme Court
justices, asked the high court to rule the charges were illegal and
unconstitutional.
   Under the law, rebellion is punishable by up to 12 years, and
murder by a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Also Thursday, Solicitor General Francisco Chavez filed a
complaint alleging that Enrile; businessman Eduardo Cojuangco; Rep.
Clara Lobregat and 16 other people misappropriated at least $4.5
million in government funds while acting as administrators of the
government's investment fund for the coconut industry.
   The complaint, filed with the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, was the fourth against Enrile and the sixth against
Cojuangco and Lobregat in connection with the investments fund.
   The commission will decide whether to seek an indictment.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino denied opposition charges that the
arrest of Enrile, her archenemy, was motivated by vindictiveness.
As Marcos' martial law administrator from 1972 to 1981, Enrile
ordered the imprisonment of thousands, including Mrs. Aquino's
husband, Benigno Aquino Jr., who was later assassinated.
   The opposition has also accused Mrs. Aquino of trying to stifle
dissent with the arrest. Military dissidents say it is a prelude to
martial law.
   Troops have been on maximum alert in the Manila area since
Tuesday to prevent any reprisals from Enrile supporters.
   On Thursday, court proceedings were halted and employees
evacuated Quezon City Hall after a bomb threat, but police found no
explosives. Police defused a homemade bomb Wednesday at a shopping
mall in the Manila financial district.

   Young soldiers have begun to desert
from the Sandinista armed forces as the deadline nears for
President Daniel Ortega to step down from office, draftees and
draftees' relatives said Thursday.
   Ortega was defeated in Sunday's election by Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, who has promised to abolish the draft after she is
inaugurated on April 25. Some deserters are apparently planning to
hide out until that happens.
   Her office announced meanwhile Thursday that the president-elect
will send a special mission to the United States next week to seek
economic aid for Nicaragua, ravaged through the years by economic
mismanagement and U.S.-imposed sanctions.
   It said Francisco Mayorga, 41, who has done postgraduate work at
Yale, will head the mission. Mayorga has often been mentioned as
possible minister of economy after Mrs. Chamorro takes office for a
six-year term.
   ``It will be an exploratory mission to have an initial picture
of what's needed, which we will combine with offers for aid already
arriving from Western Europe and Latin American countries,''
Mayorga told reporters.
   He said his team will visit Washington and New York for talks
with World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank and International
Monetary Fund officials.
   Although the leftist Sandinistas agreed to give up power to Mrs.
Chamorro and her United National Opposition alliance, they have
presented tough demands as transition teams meet to discuss terms.
   The Sandinistas want the economic structure they set up left
alone; UNO wants to decentralize the economy, privatize state
enterprises and free the marketplace.
   The Sandinistas also want the military structure left intact,
especially if the U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas don't disband;
UNO wants to depoliticize the military and reduce its size.
   Both sides want the Contras to disband immediately, but Contra
leaders say not until Mrs. Chamorro is inaugurated.
   Ortega has insisted on keeping the draft, where soldiers get
leftist political indoctrination alongside military training. Mrs.
Chamorro wants ``children to go back to school'' and the government
to stop ``making a soldier of every child.''
   Widespread desertions, as reported on Thursday, could undermine
the Sandinista position and the authority of Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega, Daniel Ortega's brother.
   Juan Carlos Medina, 18, said Thursday that 40 of 60 young men in
his Sandinista air force unit, posted at the main air base at
Managua's international airport, deserted this week.
   He said, ``They took our weapons away on Monday and didn't give
them back. Maybe they didn't trust us.''
   ``They gave me an unsigned weekend pass. I changed into my
(civilian) clothes and just walked off base,'' Medina went on.
``Nobody asked me any questions. But I'm not going back.''
   One military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press that President Ortega had ordered the military
not to stop draftees from leaving.
   Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, the Defense Ministry spokeswoman, denied
there was an Ortega order along those lines. But she said it was
normal to have desertions under the current circumstances.
   She added that it was up to commanding officers to decide how to
react to the desertions. ``We could, by law, go and get them,'' Ms.
Pasos said.
   But, she added, no deserters are being chased down because, ``We
definitely don't want to have people who don't want to be with
us,'' she said. ``And anyway, we're going to reduce the army.''
   Medina said he has 11 months to go before completing the
two-year compulsory military service for all boys age 16.
   ``I left because Dona Violeta is going to do away with the
service. So, why wait?'' he said.
   Maria Antonieta Mendoza said her grandson, 17-year-old Jose
Manuel Nunez Lopez, deserted from his Sandinista People's Army unit
in San Nicolas, near the northern city of Esteli.
   ``He just showed up here last night with nine other boys from
his unit,'' said Mrs. Mendoza. ``They had been hitchiking all day.
I almost died. I told him, what if they come and kill you?''
   Mrs. Mendoza, who said she had raised Nunez since infancy, let
him sleep the night, then early Thursday sent him into hiding with
friends. He has six months to finish his military service and will
turn 18 this month.
   ``They were treating those boys so badly, making them eat only
spaghetti for two weeks and digging tunnels,'' she said.
   She said he told her of other desertions in northern Nicaragua,
a battle area with the Contras.
   Mrs. Mendoza said her grandson told her the officers ``are
hiding all the weapons in tunnels. That they're going to leave only
the old weapons for Dona Violeta.''
   Witnesses in Juigalpa reported seeing army trucks taking 600
boxes of munitions out of an army depot in Construction Ministry
trucks; an army source said they were slated to be hidden at
ministry facilities.
   Medina said air force officers have said they will not turn
their weapons over to the new government.
   ``They'rave our cards ready, that
we would be allowed to leave on March 5. We (draftees ) decided to
wait until the 5th and if they don't let us go, we're leaving.''
   Meanwhile, Ortega gave a speech to journalists at Voice of
Nicaragua, saying he would fight to keep the station from becoming
``a voice of the government,'' even though it has always been the
government radio station.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday lifted the last
sanctions against Panama, imposed for its failure to cooperate in
drug-fighting efforts, and then toured a maximum-security prison,
saying ``tough talk is simply not enough'' in battling crime and
narcotics.
   Bush, in a day-long series of appearances in Los Angeles, also
held a fund-raising luncheon with Republican governors and was to
address the California Chamber of Commerce at dinner.
   In addition, Bush met with former President Ronald Reagan, who
took a more cautious approach than Bush on the question of
disarming the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Bush said he had sent a message though diplomatic channels
urging the Contras to lay down their arms after the defeat of
leftist President Daniel Ortega.
   Reagan, however, in response to a reporter's question, said,
``Don't you think (there) might be time enough for us to wait and
make sure that there is a civilian government in place in
Nicaragua?''
   Bush, asked if he shared Reagan's concern, declined to comment
except to say, ``We have a slight difference in policy.''
   On Friday, Bush will fly to Palm Springs for a two-day summit
with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to try to repair
relations strained by trade tensions.
   ``It's going to be an interesting meeting,'' Bush told Reagan.
``We've got to move forward on some of the tough problems we
have.'' He said Kaifu was ``a very good man.''
   In his dinner speech, Bush told businessmen that he strongly
supports drug testing of prospective employes. ``We need to make it
very clear, to every American, that if you do drugs, you don't get
hired,'' Bush said.
   He also urged them to donate ``some time and expertise to the
emerging businesses now struggling in Eastern Europe. Work with our
neighbors to the south _ in Panama and in Nicaragua as the transfer
of power takes place.''
   Most of the economic sanctions against Panama were removed in
December following the U.S. invasion and the toppling of Manuel
Antonio Noriega, who now awaits trial in Florida on federal drug
traffiking charges.
   The final remaining sanction was a denial of low tariffs and
fees on Panamanian imports. That was imposed in 1988 because of a
finding that Panama, under Noriega, was not cooperating fully with
the United States in battling drugs.
   Bush said the U.S.-backed government of Guillermo Endara was
``taking adequate steps'' to prevent the sale and shipment of drugs
and the illegal laundering of drug profits.
   ``All sanctions have now been removed against Panama,'' said
White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart.
   Interviewed by Cable News Network, Endara called the sanctions
news ``excellent'' and said, ``We in Panama are very, very thankful
for Mr. Bush
   Separately, Bush certified that 20 countries where narcotics are
produced or transported were cooperating with the United States to
fight drugs.
   The certification is necessary for them to be eligible to
receive U.S. foreign assistance. The countries include Panama and
Colombia. Bush said he was including Lebanon on the list as a
matter of U.S. national interest.
   Bush said he had decided not to certify Afghanistan, Burma, Iran
and Syria.
   Bush, on the second day of a four-day trip away from Washington,
spent the morning touring the North Los Angeles County Correctional
Facility, a $134 million, high-tech jail built to house 2,064
inmates. It opens next week.
   The president said a tour like his, although brief, ``does
concentrate the mind. It was long enough to bring anyone face to
face with the reality of what institutions like this represent.''
   He said jails were ``the ultimate proof of the community's
determination to protect itself and serve justice.''
   Noting that no federal money was used to build the jail, Bush
said, `That's a sign that your vibrant community ... knows that in
the fight against crime and drugs, tough talk is simply not
enough.''
   ``And if you're going to be tough on crime, you've got to be
tough on the criminals,'' Bush said. ``Talk to any law enforcement
officer and they'll tell you what that means: No more revolving
door. No more criminals out on the street because there isn't
enough cell space to hold them.''
   He also called for tougher state and federal laws against crime
and for stiffer penalties, including the death penalty for anyone
who murders a law enforcement officer.
   He said the federal government was doing its part, spending $1.5
billion this year to build new prisons to house 24,000 inmates.
   Bush said he is asking Congress to add $374 million more to the
prison-construction budget in 1991.
   At the prison, Bush also told law enforcement personnel not to
be dismayed by the indictments last week of 10 sheriff's deputies
and the wife of one of them on charges of skimming profits from
drug dealers.
   ``Don't let it get you down,'' Bush said, noting that they had
the largest sheriff's department in the world with 11,000 people.
``Keep your heads high. Some bad apple turns up, an officer abuses
your trust or ours by doing wrong _ we must be that much more
dedicated.''

   Conservative leaders, while proclaiming the
global decline of communism cause for celebration, began looking
Thursday for ``new problems and new threats,'' to keep their
movement together.
   At the opening of the 17th annual Conservative Political Action
Conference, David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative
Union, said movement activists, once highly suspicious of George
Bush, have been ``somewhat pleasantly surprised'' by him.
   ``I think most conservatives are relatively pleased with the
direction the administration has taken,'' said Keene.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, considered the top conservative voice
in the administration, said the conservatives should congratulate
themselves for the victories of democratic movements in Central
America and Eastern Europe.
   ``We are the ones who created the environment for the Berlin
Wall to fall,'' Quayle said at the organization's dinner Thursday
night.
   Although delivering his speech just a few feet from where
Nicaraguan Contra leader Adolfo Calero sat, Quayle barely touched
on the future of the U.S.-backed rebels now that a new president
has been elected freely in that country.
   ``Why do you think it is that the people of Nicaragua had a
chance to vote for freedom and democracy and the people of Cuba
have never had the chance to vote for freedom and democracy?'' the
vice president asked. ``The reason is very elementary: In Nicaragua
we supported the democratic resistance; in Cuba we abandoned the
resistance. Let us not make that mistake again.''
   Earlier Thursday, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House
Republican whip, noted that the Democrats have won only one of the
last six presidential elections and said, ``We can beat the left.
The question is, can we govern?''
   He said people would not be asking conservatives, ``What are you
going to do about health care? What are you going to do about drugs
and violent crime? What are you going to do about education?''
   The Georgia congressman said that ``governing is incredibly
harder than opposing.''
   Gingrich reminded the conservatives that many of them were
disappointed in Ronald Reagan, a movement hero, and said ``We will
be disappointed in Bush; we're going to be disappointed in the
president that follows.'' He added that conservatives should
``cheerfully get everything that we can today, and come back in the
morning for more.''
   But, he warned, the movement must learn not to turn its internal
fights into holy wars.
   Keene, who has described anti-communism as ``the glue that holds
the movement together,'' said that the decline of communism as a
threat had forced conservatism into ``a period of reshaping
itself.''
   ``There will be new problems and new threats,'' he said.
   He said developments overseas were forcing ``conservatives and
Republicans to focus on other problems. All in all, I would prefer
to have that problem than an armed and aggressive Soviet Union.''
   He said that while some defense-oriented conservative groups
were having trouble raising money, those with a populist, social
platform were doing well.
   Attendance at C-PAC was about the same as at the 1989
conference, said Keene, who acknowledged that the peak years were
the first few years of the Reagan presidency.

   A train struck an auto on a
grade-crossing outside Belfast Thursday night, killing three people
and injuring 27 others, officials said.
   The accident occurred at Slaught Crossing, 25 miles northwest of
Belfast. Officials said there was no indication it was connected
with Northern Ireland's sectarian and political fighting.
   The train was traveling from Belfast to Londonderry, Northern
Ireland's second-largest city 65 miles northwest of the province's
capital. Two of the train's three cars were derailed in the crash,
and one of them toppled 25 feet down an embankment, police in
Belfast reported in a statement.
   Killed in the accident was a couple riding in the car and a
train passenger, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's
police force, said in a statement. The couple's two teen-age sons,
reported in satisfactory condition at Ballymena's Waveney Hospital,
were among the 27 injured.
   Working under floodlights, firemen used cutting gear to free
those trapped in the wreckage. Five were reported in serious
condition, hospital authorities said.
   Rescue workers told of hearing screams and cries for help from
trapped passengers as they arrived on the scene in darkness and
heavy snow.
   Accident investigators from Northern Ireland Railways, the board
that runs the province's state-run network, began an immediate
investigation.
   How the auto came to be on the crossing as the train approached
was not immediately known but bad weather may have played a part.
Large parts of the British-ruled provinces were blanketed with snow
Thursday.
   Initial reports of the train striking two cars proved false,
police said.
   The mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army fighting British
rule in Northern Ireland has sometimes attacked trains and often
blown up tracks.

   Dozens of aftershocks continued to rattle
Southern California on Thursday, the day after a strong earthquake
jolted the region, causing more than $12.7 million in damages,
officials said.
   Safety inspectors in Los Angeles and neighboring San Bernardino
counties began checking gas and water lines and older, unreinforced
brick and masonry buildings in communities that sprawl beneath the
San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains.
   The estimate of more than $12.7 million in damages to private
and public property, including $10 million in damages to the town
of Pomona, was ``very preliminary,'' cautioned Mike Guerin of the
state Office of Emergency Services. The figure was based on reports
from cities and counties, Guerin said. ``They, and we, acknowledge
the numbers are incomplete.''
   Wednesday's 3:43 p.m. quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale
and was centered three miles northwest of Upland, 40 miles east of
Los Angeles.
   It was the most serious temblor to hit California since
October's magnitude-7.1 quake in the San Francisco Bay area, which
left 67 people dead and sparked fears of the massive earthquake
predicted for the state in coming years.
   Dozens of aftershocks continued to shake Southern California on
Thursday, with the day's strongest, magnitude 3.0, at 12:55 p.m.
   ``We just had a nice little aftershock,'' Claremont Assistant
City Manager Bridget Distelrath said. ``We just get big eyes.
They're very short, they don't last long enough to get under a
table.''
   Immediately after Wednesday's jolt, there was a 5 percent chance
of a larger quake within three days, based on historical
statistics, said seismologist Lucile Jones of the U.S. Geological
Survey in Pasadena. But she said that by Thursday, the probability
had dropped to 2 percent or 3 percent.
   Injuries from the quake appeared to be minor. Cuts, bruises and
a few broken bones were the chief complaints, officials said.
   State Office of Emergency Services officials said it appeared
that Upland, La Verne, Pomona, Ontario and Claremont were most
affected, with Pomona and Claremont each declaring emergencies.
   La Verne City Council members on Thursday afternoon decided to
withdraw an emergency declaration issued the day before. They
learned damage was likely to range only between $500,000 and
$750,000, said Mayor Pro Tem Thomas R. Harvey.
   ``Things are much better than we ever expected,'' Harvey said,
adding 62 buildings in La Verne were reported damaged.
   Pomona Mayor Donna Smith said during the afternoon that her
city's damage estimate was $10 million, down from an earlier figure
of $20 million.
   City officials said they decided after a tour of Pomona that the
damage was not as bad as initially thought, although city
inspectors declared 301 buildings damaged and 17 uninhabitable.
Smith said there was extensive damage to grandstands at the Los
Angeles County Fairgrounds.
   Pomona City Hall was closed as workers shoveled out broken glass
and replaced it. Smith said the building would reopen Friday.
   The city of 113,000 is the largest in the immediate vicinity of
the epicenter.
   Among the damaged structures was the historic Phillips Mansion,
which was built in 1875 and was the home of one of the area's
founding families, said Smith. A chimney on the mansion crumbled
and crashed through the roof.
   Also in Pomona, brick and concrete trimming from a wall of the
chapel of the Trinity United Methodist Church tumbled through a
roof and into an unoccupied Sunday school nursery below. About 40
children in a day care center in the building escaped injury.
   ``It's lucky the Sunday school nursery wasn't being used at the
time. I understand there was a brick in a crib,'' said Helen
Tayles, an office manager for the Pomona Unified School District,
which operates the center.
   The children were moved to another building while inspectors
examined the church and its buildings. Damage was estimated at
$50,000.
   In La Verne, about 40 structures were damaged, including a
20-foot by 70-foot wall at an auto parts warehouse that collapsed,
said Assistant City Manager Jeff Allred. At least 70 workers ran
for their lives, but no one was seriously injured, said supervisor
Stan Sokolowski.
   In Upland, about 25 reports of minor damage were being
investigated, officials said.
   The city library, where books flew off shelves, remained closed
for cleanup, the officials said. City Hall, where a picture window
shattered, was open for business, as were schools.
   Officials in San Bernardino County said it would take several
days before they could attach a dollar amount to the damage, which
appeared to be minimal.
   ``We're pretty much back to a normal mode here. We came through
it pretty much unscathed,'' said Al Langworthy, emergency
preparedness planner for San Bernardino County.
   ``The greatest concern we had was the short failure of our 911
system and the total overload of conventional phone lines,''
Langworthy said.
   Rock slides that blocked mountain and canyon roads were cleared
by the California Highway Patrol.
   The quake, five miles below the surface, ruptured a fault
running from the northeast to the southwest, said seismologist Kate
Hutton at the California Institute of Technology. It followed a
3.6-magnitude quake at 12:37 p.m.
   The worst recent Southern California quake struck the Whittier
area Oct. 1, 1987. It measured 5.9 and, together with a
5.3-magitude aftershock on Oct. 4, killed eight people, injured
more than 200 and caused $358 million in damage.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage and
6 severe damage.

   An early morning house fire so intense it
thwarted all efforts at rescue killed seven people Wednesday,
including three children.
   By the time firefighters were called to quell the blaze in a
one-story frame house in Delta Township outside Lansing at 2:15
a.m., the home was engulfed in flames, and rescuers were kept at
bay.
   ``It was all in flames when I came out,'' said neighbor Larry
Riker. ``The windows were popping out.''
   Delta Township Fire Chief Victor Hilbert identified the dead as
David Forquer and his wife, LeAnne, and their children, Michael, 8,
Christor, 6, Nona, 5, and Louis, 3. Another man who apparently also
was living in the house was killed, said Hilbert, who didn't
release the man's name.
   The roof and floor of the home fell into the basement, hampering
efforts to find bodies, Hilbert said said.
   The stress of sifting through the charred rubble took a heavy
toll on the more than 40 firefighters who were at the scene,
Hilbert said.
   ``We've had a number of people emotionally collapse over this.
Some of them just cried it out,'' he said.
   The tragedy shocked the neighborhood, said resident Gary Moyer.
   ``It's been hard on them. A couple of them went to work this
morning and had to come home. It's bad enough for the parents, let
alone them little kids,'' said one neighbor, Gary Moyer.
   ``The worst part is it just went up so fast there just wasn't
anything anybody could do about it.''

   About 27,000 gallons of heating oil spilled
into a busy waterway Wednesday a few miles from the Statue of
Liberty when it was loaded onto a leaking barge at an Exxon Corp.
terminal, the Coast Guard said.
   Exxon Corp. offered to help the Coast Guard clean up the spill,
but said the barge wasn't an Exxon vessel. The No. 6 heating oil
was being loaded at Exxon's terminal by private contractors when it
spilled into the Kill Van Kull, a waterway that separates New
Jersey from the New York City borough of Staten Island.
   The early-morning spill occurred just a few miles from the
confluence of the Van Kull and Arthur Kill, the scene of the Jan.
1-2 spill that leaked 567,000 gallons of heating oil from a pipe
connecting Exxon Co. USA's terminal with the company's Bayway
refinery in Linden, N.J. The waterway is a busy barge and tanker
route that connects with Upper New York Bay.
   The spill spanned the 3{-mile length of the Kill Van Kull and
the sheen of thin layers of oil was spotted near the Statue of
Liberty on Liberty Island, about five miles to the northeast.
   Environmental officials said eight bands of oil, measuring up to
500 feet wide and three miles long, were sighted in Lower New York
Bay, as close as 50 to 60 yards from the New Jersey shore.
   By nightfall, there were reports of globs of oil washing ashore
on Staten Island, and at Coney Island at the mouth of New York Bay.
   Clean-up crews set booms around the damaged barge and skimmer
boats worked the waterway.
   Experts weren't immediately able to gauge the damage to
wildlife, said Rick Fulton, spokesman for the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection.
   Six oil-soaked birds were spotted floundering near the
waterfront, but they disappeared by the time rescuers arrived, said
Peter Cohen, director of the Hudson County emergency management
office.
   The earlier Exxon spill is still under investigation by the
state and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and by local
agencies.
   The company was indicted on criminal charges Tuesday by a
federal grand jury in Alaska in the Exxon Valdez tanker spill,
which unleashed nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into
Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24. Exxon could face $700
million in penalties for the two felony and three misdemeanor
charges.
   Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Crawley said Wednesday's spill came from a
12-inch by 6-inch hole in the barge, owned by Eklof Marine of
Staten Island. State officials said the hole was caused by a
tugboat attempting to position the barge, but Coast Guard officials
couldn't confirm that.
   A secretary at Eklof's offices said the company had no immediate
comment.
   An Exxon news release said oil bought by Eklof for an
international customer was being loaded onto the barge and said
Exxon wasn't involved in the accident.
   ``Exxon has offered its full cooperation to the Coast Guard and
the barge owner in assistance with the spill response,'' said Exxon
spokesman Jack Holleran.
   Environmentalists expressed concern that tides and wind could
move the slick into areas of New York Harbor that serve as breeding
grounds for migratory waterfowl.

<HEAD>Ex-Wife of Henry Miller Arrested for Illegal Marijuana Possession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Thursday the Japanese ex-wife of writer
Henry Miller has been arrested on charges of illegal possession of
marijuana.
   Hoki Tokuda, 56, was arrested Sunday when police found a package
containing 1 gram of marijuana resin at her Tokyo home, said an
official at Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Ms. Tokuda, born in Tokyo, worked as an actress and a singer
after studying piano and music composition at a college in Canada.
She went to Los Angeles in 1966 to perform as a jazz singer at a
restaurant, and married Miller the following year, according to
police.
   After her divorce from Miller in 1978, Ms. Tokuda returned to
Tokyo and continued her career as an actress. She also manages a
small jazz club in Tokyo.
   Miller is considered one of the most influential American
writers of the 20th century. Among his works are ``Tropic of
Cancer,'' ``Tropic of Capricorn'' and ``Nexus.'' Miller died in
1980.
   Convicted violators of Japan's Narcotics Control law face up to
10 years in prison.

   The strong earthquake in Southern California on Wednesday
recalled the far greater tragedy that struck the San Francisco Bay
area _ and was shared by much of the nation via television _ on
Oct. 17.
   As millions of Americans were tuning in to watch the third game
of the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and cross-bay
rival Oakland Athletics, the picture began to shake.
   Viewers were seeing the first effects of a quake measuring 7.1
on the Richter scale. The temblor, centered far south of San
Francisco, killed 67 people, injured about 3,000 and did $7 billion
in damage.
   Dozens of buildings collapsed in San Francisco's marina
district, and some blocks of apartments were consumed by flames fed
by natural gas leaks. A 50-foot section of the top deck of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge fell in. Damage was widespread in
Santa Cruz and Watsonville, cities nearer the quake's center many
miles south of San Francisco.
   Worst, by far was the collapse of 1{ miles of elevated deck on
the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland.
   Over the next few days, rescuers tunneled into the rubble to
pull out 43 bodies _ and one survivor, Buck Helm. The so-called
``Miracle Man'' died later of injuries.
   The ground at the quake's center, in a wooded area called area
called Loma Prieta in Santa Cruz County, has become a tourist
attraction of sorts.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   Prosecutors are pressing their investigation
of Mayor Marion Barry by issuing a new series of subpoenas for city
records, as Barry prepares for a June trial on charges of cocaine
possession and perjury.
   Barry pleaded innocent Wednesday to five misdemeanor cocaine
charges and three felony perjury counts at a federal court
arraignment. U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
scheduled a June 4 trial.
   ``We will not plea bargain, and the mayor is not considering
resigning,'' Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said after the
nine-minute court proceeding. ``The mayor is confident he will be
vindicated at trial.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens would not comment on the
possibility of a plea bargain, but said the probe was continuing
``with respect to a variety of allegations'' involving Barry and
various city services.

   In a confirmation of time-honored ways, a study
today concludes that the old-fashioned stethoscope is just as good
as electronic monitors _ and maybe even better _ for checking
babies during birth.
   The researchers found signs that cerebral palsy may be more
common among infants whose births are electronically monitored,
possibly because the monitors led doctors to wait longer before
acting to rescue a baby in distress.
   But they cautioned that this finding could be a statistical
fluke. Experts said, moreover, that monitors are likely to remain
in use, in part because they require less manpower in the delivery
room.
   Electronic fetal monitors were introduced in the early 1970s and
now are a fixture of delivery rooms everywhere. Still, doctors have
only recently begun rigorous testing to see if the machines help
produce healthier babies.

   While environmentalists generally praise the
criminal indictment of Exxon Corp. in the massive Alaskan oil
spill, some are bemoaning the fact that no individual corporate
officials were charged.
   ``There are some people hiding behind the corporate cloak,''
Erik Olson, an attorney for the Natural Wildlife Federation, said
Wednesday. ``If you are not punishing the individuals, you are only
punishing some ethereal corporate, artificial entity.''
   But proving criminal legal violations against individuals would
be much more difficult than bringing charges against the
corporation and its subsidiary, Exxon Shipping Co., legal experts
say.
   ``A corporation doesn't act through one person but may act
through a combination of individuals. So no one of them had a
requisite criminal intent,'' said Norman Bernstein, a Washington
environmental lawyer who represents large corporations.

   Bench warfare has broken out in the city's
subways, as the Transit Authority yanks seats from stations to
force the slumbering homeless to find other accommodations.
   Not all stations _ just in those where officials say the
homeless congregate, using benches as places to sleep and worse.
   ``These benches are not used by the general public,'' said
Transit Authority spokesman Bob Slovak. ``These are benches that
have been taken over by the homeless, benches that have been
defecated on, urinated on.''
   The effort started last week, when 10 benches were removed from
three stations. The program drew immediate condemnations from an
unusual coalition of homeless advocates and commuter groups.

   The city's sweeping education reform effort is
getting its first major test as principals learn whether they're
being rehired or fired by parents.
   Although the process is being declared a success at most
schools, teachers and students in the nation's third-largest school
system are protesting some firings, and accusations of backroom
deals and bigotry have surfaced.
   These disruptions have raised doubts about the effectiveness of
the councils that were elected in October as part of a package to
improve Chicago's troubled schools by putting more power in the
hands of local communities.
   Under the 1988 reform law, half the 540 community councils _ one
for each of the 71 high schools and 469 elementary schools _ decide
this year whether to terminate their principals' four-year
contracts. The 270 other councils vote on their principals next
year.

<HEAD>``H.E.L.P.'' _ New ABC Action Drama Needs It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``H.E.L.P.,'' ABC's promising new action drama
about an experimental New York City emergency services unit, has
more than its share of p.r.o.b.l.e.m.s.
   That's too bad, because ``H.E.L.P.,'' which premieres Saturday,
is shot entirely in New York and has a few splendid actors fighting
to breathe life into what is rather formulaic writing.
   The show is about the experimental, and fictional, Harlem
Eastside Lifesaving Program, which combines police, fire and
paramedic services under a single commander, fire Battalion Chief
Pat Meacham.
   The politically beleaguered Meacham is ably played by John
Mahoney, a Tony award winner in John Guare's ``House of Blue
Leaves'' on Broadway.
   Chief Meacham, Mahoney and New York City have their work cut out
for them in the batty pilot episode written by executive producers
Dick Wolf and Christopher Crowe, and directed by Crowe.
   ``H.E.L.P.'' opens on a child floating face down in a bathtub.
Cut to child's hair. Zoom in on horrified reaction of older sister.
Cut to panicked mom. Mom runs past teddy bear. Cut to calm
dispatcher. Panicked mom. Ambulance rolling. Overhead shot of
unconscious child. Cut to haggard, unshaven, chain-smoking
dispatcher telling mom he will coach her in CPR.
   At some point, one becomesaware that the scene has the same
style, texture and ``warmth'' of commercials we get these days from
large multinational corporations. The susceptible viewer will feel
immediately compelled to run out and buy a cellular phone or
something. The sequence is manipulative, shallow and cheap. Check
it against the commercial that immediately follows.
   There's an exciting sequence of a helicopter evacuation from a
burning tugboat in the East River. The operation gets Meacham's
politically touchy program into conflict with his supervisor and
mentor, a plump, smooth district chief wonderfully played by John
Finn.
   There's another wonderful performance from Brad Sullivan,
playing a coarse, demanding older firefighter who plagues the
Sensitive Rookie (Tom Breznahan). The old pro is the most
interesting character in the episode, but there's every indication
this will be a one-time appearance by Sullivan, and that is
genuinely too bad.
   ``H.E.L.P.'' throws in some arson, a barely comic incident in
which a cougar prowls a tenement cellar, official corruption, an
implausibly swift arson investigation and an unbelievably pat
ending.
   In the 44-plus minutes of Ernest Dickerson's swooping
photography, you will become tired of the overhead shot and
atmospheric lighting of smoky offices and unsmoky burning buildings.
   Believability is something this show needs if it is to survive,
for it seems to have been conceived as ``Hill Street Blues'' with
fire engines.
   Responsibility for that must lie with Wolf, who was co-executive
producer of ``Miami Vice'' in its last two years and was executive
script consultant for ``Hill Street Blues.''
   Publicists for ``H.E.L.P.'' promise us ``the same gritty,
ground-breaking style'' that made a hit of ``Hill Street Blues.''
   That gritty ground, though, is pretty much broken, and what
``H.E.L.P'' gives us is pretty much just another
firefighter-cop-paramedic show.
   That's a great pity to this reviewer, for there is something
fundamentally dramatic about a line of work that sometimes requires
human beings to run into burning buildings and crawl around on the
floor in search of their fellow human beings.
   Until ``H.E.L.P.'' can convey that, it is in t.r.o.u.b.l.e.

   Wendy Stanek stiffened instantly.
   She had been slouched on the witness stand, acting more like a
defiant teen-ager than the undercover drug informer that she is.
Then the lawyer asked about threats.
   ``Threats? Yeah, someone has been calling me lately,'' said
Stanek, a mother of seven. ``I'm thinking of moving the kids, yes.''
   Pivoting in her chair, she glared at half a dozen defendants
accused of dealing drugs, each of whom she had helped put in the
Iron County courtroom that day. ``Whoever's calling me, I hope
you're enjoying it,'' she said to them.
   Stanek expected threats when she contacted the police last
summer and volunteered to become an informer in Crystal Falls, a
remote timbering town of 1,965 people near the Wisconsin border in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   Now a caller is promising to do perverted, criminal things to
her children.
   Yes, it's bad, this 35-year-old unemployed, twice-divorced
barmaid said late one night last month, drinking beers and smoking
cigarettes at a downtown tavern. A friend was home watching the
kids.
   The bar owner ordered a beer and sat down beside Stanek. ``I
give her a lot of credit,'' he said, raising his glass in salute.
   The police are doing what they can about the threats, trying to
identify the caller and increasing patrols past her two-story house
in the middle of town, but they say they have no way to protect
Stanek totally from retribution.
   Officers warned Stanek it might be like this. ``All it takes is
one idiot. All it takes is one flake,'' said Lt. Bill Johnson, the
Michigan State Police detective who heads UPSET, the Upper
Peninsula Substance Enforcement Team, a federally funded drug task
force.
   ``Wendy is one who just wouldn't listen,'' Johnson said. ``She
was motivated very strongly because of the death of her son.''
   Stanek's life turned on its edge in June 1987 when her eldest
child, 15-year-old Ryan, died in a car crash after hitching a ride
home with friends who had been at a party.
   His ashes are in a marble box in a glass cabinet in the corner
of the dining room. Ryan's soiled baseball cap sits on top of the
box, next to Stanek's many citations and a photograph of a Crystal
Falls girl who killed herself, one of three local teen suicides
last year _ a reminder to Stanek of the perils faced by the town's
children, and her own.
   Stanek describes the cabinet as ``my little tomb.''
   After an emergency room nurse mistakenly gave Stanek the clothes
of another boy hurt in the accident and she found a hash pipe
tucked in one of the shoes, Stanek took her rage and grief to
Johnson and UPSET. In June, she penetrated the drug world in
Crystal Falls and surrounding small towns, buying more cocaine and
marijuana than the task force could pay for.
   She said she simply picked up the phone and called almost 50
people and asked if they would sell her marijuana or cocaine. All
but one said yes.
   Stanek said it was amazingly easy. It gave her a giddy sense of
justice. ``Anybody could do it. You could do it,'' she told a
reporter.
   She broke her cover and quit her bar job at Christmas when UPSET
went public with 23 arrests in Crystal Falls, Iron River and
neighboring towns.
   The threats started immediately.
   ``Those people are scums anyway,'' Stanek told The Associated
Press after the first calls. ``They said they would hire a hit man
from Chicago. Big deal.''
   Until a Feb. 14 message, the threats were aimed only at Stanek.
But on Valentine's Day, she received an envelope with a magazine
clipping of a mother caressing a naked baby. There was also a
handwritten note.
   ``Less than 15 minutes after this picture was taken, the woman
was stripped completely nude and both she, and the child, were
thrown into a large vat of boiling water! Bye Bye Wendy!''
   The calls threatening to harm Stanek's children, always by the
same male voice, were coming at the rate of one a day until 10 days
ago, when they tapered off. But Stanek is still considering moving
her family out of Michigan.
   Stanek's eldest son, Jamey, 15, wants to stay in Crystal Falls.
   ``I don't want to move,'' he said, wearing a plaid hunting shirt
and fidgeting at the kitchen table, anxious to go snowmobiling.
   ``I won't go,'' Jamey said.
   ``He'll go,'' said Stanek, who went on welfare after quitting
her job and who spends most of her days in court testifying against
the men and women she says sold her drugs.
   Around their disagreement, chaos momentarily held forth.
Thirteen-year-old Rikki, her blonde hair moussed in the latest
gravity-defying fashion, had just baked a cake but was insisting
her mother frost it. Two-year-old Lacy, wearing nothing but one of
her brothers' T-shirts, was racing bare-bottomed across the
linoleum behind a hyperactive terrier mutt named Pee Wee.
   After spending an eight-hour day at the courthouse, Stanek stood
in the kitchen juggling the demands of supper _ a skillet of ground
beef and Hamburger Helper _ along with the cake, the dog, her kids,
a reporter and a photographer, and telephone calls from a
television network news producer.
   This is normal, said Scott Thrasher, Stanek's boyfriend, as he
watched from a perch at the kitchen table.
   The threats have not changed Stanek's life, said Thrasher, who
owns a gas station in nearby Sagola.
   ``Most of it has been good,'' Thrasher said. ``When we go out to
dinner, somebody stops by to congratulate Wendy.''
   But the threats against her children have the otherwise
unshakeable Stanek worried. She turned from the stove, gripping the
skillet of hamburger in one hand and the spatula in the other.
   ``If they touch my kids, I'll kill them.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you think ``the conscience of an investor''
is a contradiction in terms, you haven't reckoned with one
persistent and growing trend in the world of finance.
   By most accounts, the old idea of ethical or socially conscious
investing not only survived, but thrived, through the supposedly
amoral '80s.
   Now some observers think the idea is poised for a new surge to
prominence. One day soon, they postulate, securities like stocks
and mutual funds could come in for the same degree of social
scrutiny now focused on items like fur coats and disposable diapers.
   ``Social investing was once looked upon by investment
professionals as a fringe activity dominated by kooks and cranks,''
says Suzanne Harvey, an analyst who specializes in the subject for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``Today, large and small money-management firms, as well as
individual retail advisers, are all finding that to ignore this
market is to risk losing out on billions of dollars of business.''
   In the mutual fund industry, for example, she says funds with
social or ethical agendas now manage some $7.6 billion in assets,
compared with about $5.5 billion two years ago.
   While that's still only a small slice of a $1 trillion business,
it has already grown bigger than some skeptics thought it ever
would get.
   If there has been one dominant responsibility issue in the
investment world to date, it has been the politics of South Africa.
   ``The money-management business here in the United States will
never be the same as a result of the racial tension in South Africa
and the social investment trend it spawned,'' Ms. Harvey says in a
just-published report on the subject.
   ``Without question, the success of the anti-apartheid
community's efforts to bring pressure on South Africa through the
investment markets in the United States has encouraged phenomenal
growth in activist groups pursuing the same path for their own
special causes.''
   Among the other subjects Pru-Bache has singled out for attention
to date: Northern Ireland, the environment, defense, nuclear power,
tobacco and alcohol, product quality, and treatment of employees
with AIDS. It doesn't take much imagination to think of other
potential candidates for such a list.
   Pru-Bache analysts say the idea of introducing subjective
judgments of value into practical investment calculations still
puzzles, or even infuriates, a significant segment of the financial
world.
   The idea of the markets, the resisters say, is not to honor
ideals or good intentions, but to reward business ventures that
demonstrate their value through the objective measures of
profitability and growth.
   To skew the markets through aesthetic or moral judgments, they
argue, risks damaging the effectiveness of American business in a
cold-blooded world marketplace.
   On top of that, they contend, it is a mistake to think that
hard-headed investors must be hard-hearted as well.
   As the investment advisory service Smart Money has urged,
``Invest your money for maximum gains. Then, if you wish, use some
of your profits to aid causes you consider socially responsible
through contributions and gifts.''
   With that approach, the firm contends, ``your assistance to
causes you consider socially desirable will be direct and more
likely to bring beneficial results.''
   At the moment, however, the debate seems increasingly academic.
If demand keeps growing for socially based investment services,
reinforced by such things as laws covering public pension funds, it
seems certain that someone on Wall Street will hasten to meet it.
   As another Prudential-Bache analyst, Mark Melcher, puts it:
``Like it or not, social investing will be around for a while _
whether you are adamantly against the trend, a reluctant
participant, view the whole thing as a marketing tool, or welcome
it for personal reasons.''

<HEAD>Claire Bloom on Acting: `The Only Thing I Could Have Done'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   She was the Juliet of her generation in
Shakespeare's drama of star-crossed lovers, and at age 19 shared
``Limelight'' with Charlie Chaplin.
   Now, after a 13-year absence, Claire Bloom has returned to the
London stage, affirming her commitment to a profession she calls
``the only thing I could have done.''
   ``I loved the make-believe side of acting; I still do. I like
being somebody else,'' she said. ``It's given me a whole life. I've
traveled, I've met people, a whole world was opened for me. Chaplin
opened it, really, and gave me a different life.''
   In 1951, Bloom was chosen from obscurity to play the limpidly
beautiful, suicidal dancer in Chaplin's ``Limelight.'' It was one
of those rare debut performances that guarantee stardom.
   She is 59 now, and has moved regularly between movies and the
stage, America and her native England. She is on home turf once
again, doing a play by Henrik Ibsen, with whose work she remains
identified.
   Through March 24, she is starring at north London's Almeida
Theater in ``When We Dead Waken,'' Ibsen's heavily symbolic and
rarely performed final play, written in 1899.
   Bloom plays the spectral Irena, an aging beauty who appears
shrouded in white to haunt the sculptor, Rubek, whose masterwork
she inspired ages ago.
   With Rubek, played by Norwegian actor Espen Skjonberg, she
embarks on a lethal erotic gavotte that takes them up a mountain
peak in the last of three acts. There, they meet their shared fate
in an accident that, paradoxically, seems inevitable given the
tragic momentum of the play.
   ``This is the most difficult part I've ever played,'' she says.
``I knew the play, and I'd always thought it rather wonderful, but,
like any play, you know it in a kind of abstract form.''
   Still, one wonders what compels an internationally acclaimed
actress to work in a 303-seat ``fringe'' theater for a scant 165
pounds (about $280) a week.
   ``I just had a picture of an extraordinary play, and an
extraordinary character _ which she is,'' she explains.
   During lunch at an Italian restaurant near her Chelsea house,
Bloom's natural beauty is shadowed by tenseness. The opening
performance two days earlier had been shaky. Other cast members
flubbed lines and she felt the production was insufficiently
rehearsed.
   Reviews were mixed. Jack Tinker in the Daily Mail praised the
actress' ``stirring account of a life sucked dry,'' but John Gross
in the Sunday Telegraph said he could ``never quite believe in her
as an avenging fury.''
   Bloom is not eager to dwell on reviews. ``They're an unbearable
torment to read, an unbearable torment not to read.''
   She last appeared on the London stage opposite Daniel Massey in
a 1977 revival of Ibsen's ``Rosmersholm,'' and she was a notable
Nora in ``A Doll's House'' on both sides of the Atlantic.
   Why the passion for Ibsen?
   She recalls discovering his plays in her teens: ``It didn't take
much brain to know one was seeing a great playwright; they had an
enormously strong effect on me then.''
   Bloom is choosy. She'd rather not act than accept a role she
doesn't like.
   ``I very systematically built a career,'' she reflects. ``I was
extremely careful, guided by my mother. ... `You only do what's
first-class,' she said.''
   Bloom was born in London to a peripatetic family of Jewish
immigrants. She left school at 14, and just three years later was
playing Ophelia to Paul Scofield's Hamlet at Stratford-upon-Avon.
   Her West End debut came alongside John Gielgud and Richard
Burton in ``The Lady's Not for Burning,'' followed by the first of
several Juliets, a role that she recalls acting out of her own
romantic longing.
   She gladly left England. ``You can't imagine what it was like:
gray, emotionally gray, and well-mannered to the point of
suffocation.''
   Her breakthrough came with ``Limelight,'' in which Chaplin
dropped the little-tramp role to play a failed vaudeville clown who
helps a young dancer overcome paralysis.
   In her 1982 autobiography, Bloom described her happiness working
in ``Limelight'':
   ``I had been playing out a girlhood dream inspired by my broken
family _ the dream of the fairy godfather.''
   She went on to act in such movies as ``The Brothers Karamazov,''
``The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,'' ``Charly'' and ``Look Back
in Anger,'' the film of the John Osborne play that unleashed the
angry-young-man phase of British drama.
   In 1974, she starred in an eight-month West End run of ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' which left her, she says, ``an absolute
wreck by the end.''
   She brought her skills as a tragic actor to British TV as the
coolly elegant Lady Marchmain in ``Brideshead Revisited'' and the
cancer-ridden American poet Joy Davidman in ``Shadowlands.'' In
1987, she was the well-heeled suburbanite whose husband contracts
AIDS in ``Intimate Contact.''
   That year, she kept unexpected company as Shashi Kapoor's
sad-eyed lover in Stephen Frears' ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid.''
   ``It was different, very different,'' she said of the film's
controversial look at the underside of Thatcher-era Britain. ``It
certainly showed lots of parts of London I'd never seen before _
and am not terribly keen to see again.''
   She was less pleased with her role as Martin Landau's passive,
withdrawn wife in last year's Woody Allen film ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' which has received three Academy Award nominations.
   ``He could have made her interesting, but he wasn't interested
in her,'' she said. ``I thought it would be interesting to work
with Woody ... (But) I never spoke to him; he doesn't speak.''
   Midway through the interview, Bloom's demeanor changes markedly.
In walks novelist Philip Roth, her long-time companion, and she
becomes warmer and more relaxed. ``Hey,'' she exclaims, excitedly
clapping her hands.
   Roth, preparing a trip to Czechoslovakia, has stopped in for a
mineral water on his way to a travel agent.
   Theirs is an intensely private relationship. Roth won't talk
while the tape recorder is on, and after he leaves, Bloom moves the
conversation to her daughter, Anna, 30, a rising opera singer who
is fresh from an Amsterdam engagement in Mozart's ``Cosi Fan
Tutte.''
   ``I love the fact that she has a totally different career to me
but one that interests me enormously,'' Bloom says. ``I'm known
among her friends as the biggest backstage mother; I make it my
business to see everything she does.''
   Anna was born of Bloom's 10-year marriage to actor Rod Steiger.
Her second marriage, to New York producer Hillard Elkins, was
shorter-lived, and she has lived with Roth for 15 years.
   The main men in her life have all been American, but her heart
resides in London. ``The place I fled from in the '50s doesn't
exist anymore,'' she said.
   ``It's a wonderful place to live now. I never really left.''

<HEAD>Playwright Arthur Kopit Creates a Past for His `Phantom of the
Opera'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NBC miniseries ``Phantom of the Opera''
shouldn't be confused with the hit musical selling out in London,
New York and Los Angeles, though both adaptations first were
conceived as stage musicals.
   Playwright Arthur Kopit, author of the Tony Award-winning
musical ``Nine,'' came up with a play eight years ago about the
mysterious, masked figure who haunts the Paris Opera House. He
wrote it in collaboration with composer-lyricist Mauron Yeston, and
Geoffrey Holder was to direct.
   But Andrew Lloyd Weber was the first to launch his version of
Gaston Leroux's classic novel of horror and passion.
   Kopit's two-part, four-hour ``Phantom of the Opera'' will be
broadcast Sunday and Monday, starring Burt Lancaster as the former
theater manager, Charles Dance as the Phantom, Teri Polo as
Christine, Ian Richardson as the new theater manager, Andrea
Ferreol as the opera prima donna and Adam Storke as the count.
Two-time Oscar winner Tony Richardson directed on location in Paris.
   ``It took me about a year to come up with an approach I liked,''
Kopit said. ``I read the novel and I looked at Lon Chaney's 1925
movie. There were two other versions beside that. I looked at those
to see what they did. Each has a fundamentally different approach
from the one I take.
   ``They all begin with the Phantom involved with Christine, but
you never know how it began. I had to see what attracted him to
her.''
   Kopit is best known as a Tony-nominated playwright whose other
works include ``Wings,'' ``Indians'' and ``Oh, Dad, Poor Dad,
Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feeling So Sad.'' But he also
wrote the miniseries ``Hands of a Stranger'' and several TV movies.
He's even written two sitcom scripts.
   He's working now on an ABC miniseries and a new musical based on
``The Scarlet Pimpernel'' for an April 1991 Broadway opening and is
adapting ``Wings'' for the Hallmark Hall of Fame series.
   After writing ``Hands of a Stranger'' for NBC, the network asked
if there was anything else he wanted to do. He sent them Leroux's
novel and suggested a two-part miniseries. There was some
reluctance after the Weber musical opened, but Kopit overcame it.
   ``There's not a clue in the story as to why the Phantom fell in
love,'' Kopit said. ``I had to see why he puts his own life in
jeopardy for this girl. The old theater manager has a relationship
with him in the book, but I made him his father. I wanted the
Phantom to have always lived in the Opera House. The Phantom falls
in love with Christine because of her voice. ...
   ``This is a `Beauty and the Beast' story. It's also a mixture of
`Cinderella' and `Faust.' It's a story in which the image more so
than the execution has captured the public's imagination. It
reminds us of dreams.''
   Kopit says it's not an accident the story takes place in an
opera house, calling an opera ``dreamland'' compared to the realism
of the dramatic theater.
   ``The Phantom is the serpent who is forbidden and dangerous and
alluring,'' he said. ``The opera represents beauty; the Phantom
represents the beast. When you have perfection you also have a dark
side not far behind. The Phantom is not a villain but the ultimate
outcast with an underlying sexuality.''
   Kopit called it ``a Victorian story.''
   ``I don't think it would work today,'' he said. ``You have to
have women swoon. This figure lurking near Christine is like Cathy
and Heathcliff in `Wuthering Heights.' He sweeps away the girl like
the Phantom and we know he's in trouble. The fun in writing this is
to acknowledge the genre and adhere to its dictates.''
   The miniseries is the first version ever filmed at the Paris
Opera and its vast labyrinthine cellars, believed to have been used
as dungeons during the Franco-Prussian War. Beneath the cellars is
a subterranean lake, and centuries-old legends say the building is
haunted by ghosts.
   ``It was wonderful to wander through the old building and
examine it,'' Kopit said. ``We didn't go down as far as the
catacombs or the lake. You can imagine someone getting lost down
there, which is probably how the legends began.''
   Kopit, who lives in Connecticut, had his first big success with
``Oh, Dad'' when he was 22. He studied engineering at Harvard and
wrote plays on the side.
   ``I have mostly been writing plays, but I hope now to do some
feature films,'' he said.

<HEAD>Analysts: GOP Coalition Intact But Vulnerable</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There may be some cracks in the voter
coalition that has enabled Republicans to win five of the last six
presidential elections, but GOP consultants say they're not worried
yet.
   They don't think the Democrats will be able to take advantage of
a split among GOP factions any time soon.
   At a forum sponsored by the Progressive Policy Institute, six
Republican consultants, analysts and political scientists said
strains within their party, notably on abortion, may send some
voter blocs away mad.
   But they said the Democrats are likely to remain a party of
liberal positions and candidates, reducing the risk of defections
or disinterest among GOP voting blocs.
   David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union, said
``the glue of the movement'' was opposition to communism, and as
the easing Cold War has made that less important, differences on
other points show more clearly.
   Pollster Lance Tarrance said anti-tax, anti-abortion,
anti-communist positions helped the Republicans assemble their
presidential coalition, beginning with white voters in the South in
the 1960s, adding ethnic and Roman Catholic groups in the '70s, and
gaining among youthful voters in the '80s.
   He said the national Democrats treat the changes as though they
were temporary, and continue to cater to liberal blocs in their
nomination campaigns, producing candidates who can't fashion a
majority in general elections.
   But Kevin Phillips, president of the American Political Research
Corp., said, ``I think that there's a lot of vulnerability in the
coalition at this point.''
   Phillips said some of the emotional, symbolic issues that helped
President Bush in 1988, things like the pledge of allegiance and
prison furloughs, are echoes of the old Southern strategy he helped
fashion more than 20 years ago.
   ``These issues are beginning to weaken,'' he said. ``The
Republican coalition is beginning to fragment on cultural issues.''
   Phillips said he thinks it will unravel in the 1990s, which
shouldn't be surprising because the coalition's roots can be traced
back more than 25 years. Historically, that has been about the life
span of dominant coalitions in presidential politics.
   But in the near term, the Republican analysts see a severe
economic downturn as the one issue that could undercut a GOP
ticket. Phillips said the Democrats lost touch with the average
voter on social issues, ``but they have not lost touch with the
average American economically.''
   Economics is the common concern of the theorists and of
practical politicians looking toward President Bush's re-election
campaign in 1992. Bush's men think he will be almost invulnerable
unless there is a major slump in the economy.
   But Republican differences do show on some other problem issues,
notably abortion.
   Paul Weyrich, president of the Free Congress Foundation, said
the Republicans began building their national coalition when they
shed their old image as the party of elites and country clubs. He
said that old style is re-emerging now, because party leaders are
taking positions that offend the religious right.
   Bush is firmly opposed to abortion, but he and other party
leaders have said there is room for Republican differences on the
issue, leeway that angers the hard-line anti-abortion groups who
resist any compromise.
   Doug Bailey, a veteran Republican campaign consultant who now
publishes a daily political newsletter, said abortion could become
a major Republican problem, even in advance of a 1992 platform
fight, should a vacancy occur on the Supreme Court.
   Bush almost certainly would appoint an abortion foe. And the
Democratic Senate, just as surely, would refuse to confirm one. A
nomination battle would focus attention on an issue Republican
leaders would prefer to play down.
   Weyrich said grass roots conservatives also were outraged when
GOP leaders agreed with the Democrats to shelve congressional pay
raises as a 1990 issue. He said that added to the impression that
the elite was back in charge.
   ``Fault lines are definitely there,'' Weyrich said. But he said
the Democrats would have to nominate a centrist for president in
order to take advantage of it, and that's unlikely.
   ``I think it will be very hard for the Republicans to lose
presidential elections in the foreseeable future,'' said Jeane
Kirkpatrick, former United Nations ambassador and former Democrat.
``If there are fault lines in the Republican Party ... you can
hardly shout across the divide in the Democratic Party.''
   The Republican panelists' consensus on the future:
   _The Democrats are bound up in presidential nomination reform
rules that are likely to keep pushing their presidential nominees
to the left in the primary election season, making them vulnerable
in general elections.
   _Neither party is producing a real vision of the American
future, and no powerful new issues loom _ although trade and
protectionism could become one. ``Except for abortion, this is
going to be a pretty boring era for the next few elections,''
Tarrance said.
   _Political cycles notwithstanding, the status quo is likely to
hold, unless there is an economic crisis. ``As long as you don't
have a very clear sense of where you want to go, George Bush is an
excellent president,'' Phillips said.

<HEAD>Increase Seen in Deaths of Drug-Exposed Babies</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   More babies seem to be dying from exposure to crack cocaine in
the womb, alarming health officials who fear they might be losing
the battle against infant mortality in drug-plagued inner cities.
   After decades of progress, infant mortality rates have begun to
creep upward in New York City, Washington, D.C., and some other
spots where the use of crack has skyrocketed.
   Researchers are cautious about blaming crack, but say the
evidence is mounting.
   ``There are lots of conjectures,'' said Dr. Joel Klienman, an
analyst with the National Center for Health Statistics, ``but ...
one likely culprit, especially for the black population, is
cocaine.''
   The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, an
independent panel that has members from both parties in Congress,
warned last Wednesday that crack use was one of several reasons why
infant deaths were likely to rise sharply in the 1990s.
   ``Progress in reducing infant mortality has stalled,'' said Sen.
Lawton Chiles of Florida, the commission's chairman. ``In the 1990s
we may see more infants die per year than the 40,000 we now lose
before their first birthdays.''
   By now, nearly everyone has seen television pictures of
premature infants, some scarcely larger than a doctor's hand,
writhing in what seems to be the agony of drug withdrawal.
   Research suggests these babies of crack addicts are not actually
addicted, says Dr. Ira J. Chasnoff, president of the National
Association for Perinatal Addiction and Research.
   They do, however, suffer from a distressing array of brain
disorders and medical problems that appear to stunt their
development for years, if not permanently. Drug-abuse expert
Douglas Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington
think tank, calls these children the new ``bio-underclass.''
   Sometimes, their ailments are fatal.
   Cocaine constricts the body's blood vessels, including those in
the placenta, the maternal organ that supplies a fetus with its
oxygen and nourishment.
   ``So, when a substance disrupts this vascular system, it sort of
messes up the pipes, to put it in simple terms,'' said Dr. Leah
Ziskind, New Jersey's acting health commissioner. ``It's like you
have a break in the plumbing.''
   That, she said, can cause ``very, very serious'' problems for a
baby's brain development, and also frequently prompts premature
labor. Some women have even been reported to use crack to induce
labor prematurely.
   Now researchers are beginning to discover that crack-exposed
infants also appear to be unusually prone to Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome, which kills babies mysteriously in their first months of
life.
   Chasnoff said other factors besides crack could play a part in
the sudden deaths _ ``the poverty, the lifestyle factors, the
adolescent mothers, the cigarette smoking.'' But crack is
indisputably part of the mix, he said.
   No national statistics document the problem, nor does any state
keep thorough records on the number of cocaine-exposed babies who
die. But the little information that is available is disturbing.
   _In Massachusetts, the state Department of Social Services keeps
a tally of those infant deaths that raise suspicion among hospital
officials. There were 24 such deaths in 1988, at least seven of
which involved cocaine use by the mothers. The number nearly
doubled to 43 in 1989, with at least 17 involving maternal cocaine
use.
   ``It seems to go along with the whole crack cocaine epidemic,''
department spokeswoman Lorraine Carli said. ``It seems to have
become the drug of choice for women.''
   _City officials in Washington, D.C., announced last September
that infant mortality jumped nearly 50 percent in the first half of
1989. They directly blamed crack cocaine. The city's new infant
mortality rate was 32.3 deaths for every 1,000 live births _ triple
the national average and worse than the averages in Chile, Jamaica
and Panama, among many other places.
   _In New York City, which keeps exhaustive records on infant
mortality and drug use, the number of infant deaths began rising in
1985, the year the crack epidemic began in earnest. That year, 5
percent of city birth certificates mentioned cocaine use by the
mother; by 1988, the figure was 21 percent. The mortality rate for
babies of coke-using mothers has been put at 35 per 1,000 _ roughly
triple the citywide average and almost four times the national
average.
   _Infant mortality also has been rising in New Jersey, where 10
cities were targeted in 1985 for special prenatal attention. But
even in these ``Healthy Mother, Healthy Baby'' cities, the infant
mortality rate rose the last two years. ``We suspect very strongly
that our increases in infant mortality in '88 and '89 are due to
the drug-abusing pregnant woman, and especially her preference for
crack,'' Ziskind said.
   Crack-related infant deaths are setting off alarms in other
states, including Ohio, Michigan, New Mexico and Rhode Island, and
some states are beginning to consider changes in birth and death
reports to gauge the extent of the problem more accurately.
   Solutions are as elusive as an end to drug abuse itself, but
health officials increasingly are looking to ``one-stop shopping''
clinics that would combine drug treatment with prenatal and
obstetric care. The idea is to provide an easy alternative for
women who might be reluctant to go to several clinics for pregnancy
care.
   ``I think the most important thing we can do is set up a system
that allows women, as soon as they are pregnant, to come in and be
counseled by health-care professionals,'' Ziskind said. ``I think
we should use this time in a woman's life to let her focus on her
body and her baby.''
   It is, she said, an opportunity to ``capture'' drug-abusing
women and maybe _ just maybe _ get them to change.

   When Joshua arrived at New England Medical Center,
senior nurse Sharon Hill could have held him in her hand. He was
three months premature and weighed two pounds. And because of
cocaine, he was suffering.
   The cocaine addiction was his mother's, but Joshua still pays
for it after three months in the hospital.
   Cocaine pushed him into the world so early and ill-equipped that
he was immediately hooked up to a ventilator and feeding tubes and
had four cardiac monitor electrodes taped to his chest.
   Although babies with breathing tubes can't make any noise when
they cry, Hill says, ``Sometimes you can see an expression that
they are crying.''
   Last year, about 10 percent of the cocaine babies born in
Massachusetts died. Some who survived suffered strokes or
intestinal failure when cocaine constricted their tiny arteries,
but most of their problems result from premature birth.
   Experts now are investigating the possibility that problems
among ``cocaine-exposed'' babies might not show up until years
later.
   Cocaine might damage the infants' central nervous systems, but
it's difficult to study their long-term prospects because
researchers find it hard to separate the effects of cocaine
exposure in the womb from poor parenting, said Barry Zuckerman,
director of development and behavioral pediatrics at Boston City
Hospital.
   ``We don't know what effect it has on the developing brain or
how it may later affect behavior,'' Zuckerman said.
   A study by the National Association for Perinatal Addiction
Research and Education has shown it takes three months before
cocaine babies weigh as much as drug-free infants and two years for
head circumference, a measure of brain development, to match that
of babies not exposed to cocaine.
   ``The most important thing ... is extreme prematurity, 10 weeks,
12 weeks, 15 weeks,'' said Benjamin Sachs, chairman of obstetrics
and gynecology at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital. ``A baby that's 12
weeks premature may remain in hospital three months and cost
$100,000. That's a serious public health problem.''
   Babies born with cocaine in their systems may alternately be
lethargic and overstimulated or given to inconsolable crying, Sachs
said.
   The study showed infants remained irritable for six to eight
weeks, placing a heavy burden on drug-addicted mothers.
   ``We're concerned that the mothers may get turned off by their
babies,'' Zuckerman said.
   The critical question might be ``to whom is this child born and
what kind of mothering is going on in that environment?'' said
Sachs, who argues that it illustrates the need for more treatment
for female addicts.
   ``There are very few places in Massachusetts where women who are
addicted can get help, and there are long waiting lists,'' he said.
   Zuckerman described it as a pay now or pay later situation.
   ``We're impressed by how hard the mothers work to stop taking
drugs and be a good mother,'' he said. ``We don't have enough drug
treatment programs for women. If you pay later, you spend the money
and have a damaged baby.''

   Here are some facts and figures about Lyme Disease:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Cases:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The federal Centers for Disease Control said 4,572 cases were
reported in 1988, and 2,368 were reported in 1987. In 1982, just
492 cases were reported. 1989 figures are not yet available.
   New York accounted for 56 percent of the 1988 cases, and 90
percent of the cases have occurred in the Northeast.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Prevention:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Wear protective clothing, such as long pants, and use insect
repellent to guard against the ticks that carry Lyme disease.
   In areas with a high concentration of the disease, clear yards
of leaves and debris that can harbor ticks or rodents that also
carry the disease. Avoid brush when possible; stay on trails.
   After being outdoors, inspect your body for ticks. If you find
one, remove it with the fingers or tweezers and apply antiseptic.
The sooner a tick is removed the better; they must feed 24 to 48
hours to transmit Lyme disease.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Symptoms:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In two-thirds of cases, the first sign is a red rash _ often in
the shape of a bull's eye _ that develops days or weeks after a
tick bite. Alternatively, early symptoms may be vague aches and a
low-grade fever.
   Next comes arthritis-like pain in the joints or nerve damage
causing pain or numbness.
   Lyme disease also can mimic many other diseases.
   Blood tests for the disease will not show results for four to
six weeks after a bite.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Treatment:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Antibiotics. If not caught early, treatment can be difficult,
requiring even intravenous antibiotics.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>History:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Lyme disease was identified in 1975 by Dr. Allen Steere, then of
Yale University. The first cases were picked up near Old Lyme,
Conn., hence the name. In 1982, researchers discovered the disease
was caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a corkscrew-shaped bacteria
carried by the ticks.

<TEXT>
   You might not lick yours chops at the
sight of ground beef mixed with beaver meat and a dash of powdered
eggs.
   But then again, you're probably not pulling a 90-pound sled and
sleeping on hay. The sled dogs of Montana's 500-mile Race to the
Sky are a different breed when it comes to dinner.
   Mushers differ in the diets they prefer for their dogs, each of
which eat, on average, about six pounds of food a day while racing.
   ``Commercial brands are common, but the supplements aren't,''
says handler Kathy Donars of Ely, Minn., whose husband, Kerry, was
one of the mushers in the week-long race but didn't finish. ``Dogs
become accustomed to getting a certain meal. Some get picky if they
have to try something else, but most eat what we give them.''
   When the dogs come off a long stretch of trail, the Donars
prefer to mix strips of liver with water as a water substitute.
   ``It gives them more nutrients that way,'' Mrs. Donars said.
``Then we'll mix some ground chicken with our commercial dog food
and let them eat.''
   Musher Bruce Graham of Seeley Lake, prefers to feed his dogs red
meat _ beaver.
   ``We brought close to 200 pounds of beaver meat with us,'' said
Rollin Welch, handler for Graham, who also didn't finish the race.
``It's a high-protein meat. They love it. On the trail, Bruce feeds
them fish and chicken patties, a little something we made up. It's
a great snack for the trail.''
   Electrolytes are a staple used by most mushers, and according to
Welch, they most closely resemble the thirst quencher Gatorade.
   Veterans on the trail, including handler Terry Adkins of Sand
Coulee, prefer a base commercial dog food mixed with powdered foods.
   ``Powdered fish, powdered eggs and some good old ground chicken
and beef are excellent dog food supplements,'' Adkins said. ``It's
important to get water into them while they're racing, so we put
the same supplement into their water.''
   Adkins has raced sled dogs since 1972. He first ran the Iditarod
in Alaska in 1974 and will be making his 16th trip this year.
   ``This is the first year we've used this kind of supplement,''
said Adkins, whose 21-year-old son, Christopher, finished sixth in
the Race to the Sky, his first sled dog race. ``I just hope the
dogs continue to look good. They're eating right, that's for sure.''
   Other mushers prefer to feed their dogs right out of the bag.
   ``We open our bag (of commercial dog food), measure out how much
they need, and let them gobble it up,'' said handler Laurie
Beckstrom of Kalispell, whose husband, Jack, came in second.
``We'll feed them every eight hours.
   ``We'll add some melted chicken fat on the food, too. We usually
add a little something into their water. In the cold weather, they
won't drink plain tap water. They enjoy baited water, and ours is a
secret.''
   For others, the secret is already out.
   ``We use high grade commercial feed, plus a lot of other
supplements that are being used by other teams,'' said Ed Borden of
Clam Gulch, Alaska, who was dog handler for Dean Osmar, the
first-place finisher. ``The main thing in race conditions like this
year is liquids. There's meat in our water, and electrolytes keep

<HEAD>Fund-Raising for Chimp Play Area Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ELLENSBURG, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central Washington University's
``talking'' chimpanzees will get a new home next year, and
fund-raising efforts are under way to give them a place to play as
well.
   While the Legislature has authorized a $1.5 million home for the
chimps, lawmakers did not finance an outdoor play and exercise area
for the five chimpanzees _ the first in the world to learn human
sign language.
   Researchers Roger and Debbi Fouts said they need to raise
$650,000 to build a secure outdoor area that will provide the
chimps with sunlight, swinging and climbing apparatus and other
benefits.
   The drive began in Seattle in January with a fund-raiser, with
Gov. Booth Gardner as host. The Fouts also intend to solicit
donations by mail.
   The new home and play area are essential for the chimps, who
have been caged on the third floor of the university's Psychology
Building for years, Fouts said.
   ``Washoe hasn't seen the sun in 10 years,'' Fouts said. Washoe
was the first animal ever to learn a human language.
   The research has been under way at the school since 1980, when
Fouts moved to this small central Washington farm and college town
from the University of Oklahoma.
   Financing has been a constant struggle.
   While Fouts is paid as a faculty member of the university, Ms.
Fouts is a volunteer, and chimp care depends on the help of up to
15 students. The university provides just $1,000 a year for the
chimps' care.
   Financial help comes from 500 subscribers who pay $25 a year for
the Fouts' newsletter. Much of the chimps' food is donated by
grocery stores and farmers, Fouts said.
   Pizza parlors occasionally donate pizzas. ``Washoe doesn't like
pepperoni,'' Ms. Fouts said.
   The new building was needed because the constant cleaning of the
animals' cages was causing water damage to the Psychology Building
and their noise disrupted classes.
   The new building, set for groundbreaking this spring and
completion next year, also will bring better public access to the
chimps, which the Fouts hope will increase donations.
   The chimps weigh up to 150 pounds and have the strength of eight
grown men, so security is important. ``People in Ellensburg
wouldn't want them walking into their houses and looking in the
refrigerator,'' Fouts said.
   The Fouts' research is behavioral, not biomedical, so a good
environment for the chimps is essential to good results.
   ``We're hoping this gives them more things to sign about, and
more interesting things to do,'' Fouts said. The ability to swing
more freely by the arms will also make the chimps happier, he said.
   To the Fouts, the Washoe Project is ``like the moon shot of the
behavioral sciences.''

<HEAD>Bird Watchers on the Lookout for Everglades Kites</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Florida bird watchers are
being asked to report sightings of the endangered Everglades kite.
   The Everglades kite also is known as the snail kite because it
exclusively eats apple snails, a wetlands mollusk whose survival is
threatened by drought.
   ``We want to identify important wetlands where the kites are so
the state can possibly protect the site,'' said wildlife biologist
Mark Maffei of the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, which has
asked for reports of sightings.
   The kite is 15 inches tall with a wingspan of 45 inches. Males
are slate gray and females are dark brown with white mottling. They
also have a white band on the tips of their tails.
   If wetlands dry up and deprive the birds of the snails, the
kites will travel far from their nests in search of food and will
not return.
   ``They just abandon their young,'' said Jim Rodgers, a biologist
for the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission. ``They won't
nest on dry ground.''
   The kite's prime habitat and nesting area are Everglades water
conservation areas in western Palm Beach, Broward and Dade
counties. These sites are parched by a severe drought that has
forced residential water restrictions.
   ``And we're just getting into the dry season,'' said Burkett
Neely, manager of the refuge. ``It was bad last year. It could be
worse this year.''
   A midwinter survey found 464 snail kites foraging in marshes
from Central Florida to the tip of the peninsula in Everglades
National Park. That was 36 fewer than the previous year's count,
Rodgers said.
   The wildlife refuge has become a clearinghouse for reports of
snail kite sightings. The birds have been found along canals,
flooded farm fields or wetland pockets as they scatter out of the
dried-out Everglades.

<HEAD>Europeans To Reproduce Atlas of Palomar's Sky Survey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Southern Observatory, which
has extensive experience making photographic plates of the heavens,
will produce copies of Palomar Observatory's definitive atlas of
the northern sky.
   The 48-inch Oschin Telescope at Palomar, located on a
mountaintop in eastern San Diego County, has been used exclusively
since 1986 for a decade-long effort to take detailed photographs of
all portions of space above the Northern Hemisphere.
   The project, known as the second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey,
will yield 2,682 photographic plates that ``will serve as the basic
astronomical guide to the northern skies for decades to come,''
said Robert Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology, which owns Palomar.
   The plates must be reproduced for sale to major research
observatories, but Caltech hasn't done such work since Palomar's
first northern sky survey was conducted in the 1940s and 1950s.
   The staff of the ESO, headquartered near Munich, West Germany,
recently produced plates of Southern Hemisphere sky surveys made in
the 1970s by its observatory in La Silla, Chile, and by the
Anglo-Australian Observatory in Australia.
   So Caltech officials decided the European Southern Observatory's
staff would be able to make high-quality plates less expensively,
keeping costs as low as possible, Robert J. Brucato, Palomar's
assistant director, said.
   Under an agreement between Caltech and ESO, the European
organization will reproduce Palomar's sky atlas in two forms: glass
plates and film transparencies.
   Brucato said the cost depends on the number of purchasers, but a
set of the glass plates probably would cost several hundred
thousand dollars, while a set of transparencies likely would cost
tens of thousands of dollars.

<HEAD>Skin Cancer Patients Sought for Study on Selenium Link</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MACON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers are looking for former skin cancer
patients in Georgia for a study on the role of selenium in
prevention of the disease.
   The Georgia Dermatology and Skin Cancer Center is taking part in
a program called ``Nutritional Prevention of Skin Cancer,'' said
Mary Reid, project coordinator of the research, sponsored by the
Arizona College of Medicine and the American Cancer Society.
   Selenium, a trace mineral found most often in volcanic soil, is
passed to humans through food, meats and grains, she said. Data
from studies around the world show that cancer is more common in
areas where selenium levels are lower. Selenium is found in only
very low levels in Georgia soil.
   The mineral helps protect cells from structural changes, Ms.
Reid said. There also has been evidence that selenium helps
stimulate the immune system.
   A total of 1,700 patients in the selenium research project come
from clinics in Georgia, Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina and
South Carolina.
   The Macon study group is the largest, with 500 people, Ms. Reid
said. But more participants are needed.
   Participants must have no history of kidney or liver problems,
as very large doses of selenium have been found to cause liver
problems. Selenium, otherwise, has few side effects.
   ``To qualify (for the study), the person must have had basal
cell or squamous cell carcinoma in the past and a recent (bout with
skin cancer) within the last 12 months as well,'' said Billie L.
Jackson, a dermatologist in the Macon center.
   Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin
cancer, affecting 80,000 to 100,000 people a year, with about 2,000
deaths reported, according to the American Cancer Society.
   Excessive sun exposure is the major factor associated with this
type of cancer.

<HEAD>Poling in Ford's Hot Seat Beginning Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-year clock starts ticking today for
Harold Poling as he takes over as head of the nation's
second-largest automaker.
   Poling, who becomes chairman and chief executive officer of Ford
Motor Co., set the timer last November when it was announced he
would replace outgoing Chairman Donald Petersen.
   The 64-year-old Poling, a year older than Petersen, said he
would be serve for only three years before giving way to another.
   ``Ideally, you'd like to have a CEO with a long future out in
front of him,'' said auto analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp;
Co. of New York.
   The transition promises to be a smooth one. Petersen and Poling
worked closely together through the last decade, when Ford moved
from a struggling company that lost $1.5 billion in 1980 to a
leaner automaker that posted an industry record $5.3 billion in
profit in 1988.
   Despite its successes, Ford still must contend with a sluggish
new car market and toughening competition from Japanese makers,
factors that combined to trim the company's profits to $3.84
billion last year. Poling has only three years to face those
challenges, and observers already are speculating on his successor.
   Edward Bowman, deputy dean of the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania, said the decision by Ford directors to
give Poling a limited term ``would imply that they weren't quite
ready in terms of succession planning, that they weren't ready to
name somebody else for a normal term.''
   Speculation for a chief executive to lead the company in the
mid-1990s and beyond centers on Allan Gilmour, a Ford executive
vice president who today adds the title of president of the Ford
Automotive Group.
   ``That seems to be the scuttlebutt right now,'' Brady said. ``I
think that may, in fact, be the plan.''
   Petersen came up through Ford's product development ranks.
   He has been credited with freeing designers and engineers in the
early 1980s to work together in developing the Ford Taurus and
Mercury Sable cars of the mid-1980s, which helped lift Ford from
the financial doldrums.
   ``I really think that Petersen made the necessary adjustments in
the product plan,'' Brady said. ``The key addition he made was to
leave product planning to the product planners.''
   Poling, who rose through the automaker's financial operations,
would be well served to follow that lead, Brady said.
   ``I think he's got to challenge (product planners) with the
charge that this is a very intensely competitive game,'' he said.
``That's all he's got to do in the product area.''
   Bowman agreed.
   ``I think he would be a nut in that three-year period to mess
with any product decisions,'' he said.
   Although Poling will have a limited amount of time as chief
executive, he has his work cut out for him.
   The U.S. auto industry is at or near the bottom of what some
analysts have called a recession that began in October. Companies
would like to wean American consumers from incentives that have
become ingrained in car buying and are eating away at corporate
profits.
   The nation's Big Three automakers, sales-leader General Motors
Corp., Ford and No. 3 Chrysler Corp., also are taking steps to
eliminate costs and streamline operations as they try to hang on to
market share in the face of stiff competition from Japanese models,
both imports and American-made cars.
   That, Brady said, is where Poling can leave his mark.
   ``His real test will be in raising the levels of productivity,''
Brady said. ``If he can follow through with the productivity
increase while the programs continue in the Petersen manner, it
will be one of the best one-two punches of all time.''
   Poling will become the fourth company chairman not a member of
the Ford family. The two Fords now in company management are
cousins William C. Ford Jr., 32, and Edsel Ford II, 41, both
great-grandsons of company founder Henry Ford.

   Media companies hope to stake a claim to a spot
in the doctor's waiting room.
   The media venture that produces the Lifetime cable network
became the latest company to try to get in the door when it
disclosed plans Wednesday to offer commercially-sponsored TV
programs on health care topics.
   The one-hour programs with nine minutes of ads would be offered
for replay throughout the day in the waiting rooms of
pediatricians, obstetricians and family practitioners.
   Officials said the service called Healthlink Television would be
distributed on videocassettes to a projected 3,000 waiting rooms
beginning sometime in the April-to-June quarter.
   A new program would be distributed every month. The venture
expects the number of participating waiting rooms to reach 20,000
by the end of the first year and ultimately reach 50,000 of the
estimated 68,000 multi-doctor offices available in those medical
specialities.
   At least two other media companies have been considering similar
advertiser-supported video projects and several are already in
waiting rooms with magazines designed for young mothers.
   Their creators are touting them as more efficient than the
traditional mass media for reaching captive audiences with pitches
for products ranging from diapers to automobiles.
   Whittle Communications, based in Knoxville, Tenn., is
considering making programs on either health care or entertainment
topics available for use in waiting rooms and recently acquired a
Florida company that was about to launch that type of service.
Whittle already publishes six quarterly magazines called Special
Reports that are in about 19,000 doctors' offices.
   Frederick N. Doner Communications Inc. of New York has been
testing what it calls the Good Health Channel in a handful of
waiting rooms over the past two months. Family Media Inc., also of
New York, recently launched a magazine specifically targeted at
women in doctors' waiting rooms.
   The waiting room ``is now becoming a cluttered scene'' for
advertisers, said Richard Kostrya, media services director at the
advertising agency J. Walter Thompson.
   He said a serious unresolved question was whether people in such
settings are receptive to advertising.
   The Healthlink Television project has the backing of some large
media companies. The venture producing it, Hearst-ABC-Viacom
Entertainment Services, is jointly owned by Hearst Corp., Capital
Cities-ABC Inc. and Viacom Inc.
   The same concern now produces Lifetime Television, a cable
network aimed at women that is available on systems serving 46
million households, and Lifetime Medical Television, which produces
TV programs for the medical community.
   Thomas F. Burchill, president and chief executive of
Hearst-ABC-Viacom Entertainment, declined to specify how much the
creators were prepared to spend on the project, but said they had
``deep pockets'' and would ``invest the necessary funds to make a
success of it.''
   The American Academy of Pediatrics, an organization with 38,000
members, has agreed to collaborate on producing programs, approve
all program content and screen the ads in return for an unspecified
royalty fee. Pitches for tobacco or prescription drugs will not be
accepted.
   Burchill said different programs would be created for each of
the three medical specialties. A typical program would include
short segments on several topics such as childhood nutrition, car
safety or choosing a day care center.
   The venture plans to loan a television set and video player to
participating physicians who are expected to run the show
continuously during the work day.
   David Moore, president of Healthlink Television, said ad rates
would start out at about $500,000 a year for a 30-second commercial
in the pediatricians' waiting rooms while charges on the programs
aimed at patients of the family practitioners and obstetricians
would be about $200,000 to $300,000 a year.
   Burchill said his company's experience in producing medical
programs and the backing of the pediatrics group should help
Healthlink compete with other waiting room services.
   But he said advertisers also will get an incentive the others
cannot offer _free ad time on the Lifetime cable network if the
audience for Healthlink fails to meet expectations.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dart Group Inc. has settled a federal
complaint alleging it had acted as an investment company because
its main assets stemmed from the sale of stocks in a series of
takeover bids for retailing companies.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Dart Group agreed on
Wednesday in effect not to buy and sell securities as its primary
business unless it registers as an investment company.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which as been
investigating the retailer since 1988, accused Dart Group in a
civil complaint in Washington federal court of violating securities
laws by acting as an unregistered investment firm.
   The SEC charged that since 1984, when it sold off the Dart drug
store chain, ``a majority of the total consolidated assets of Dart
Group have been composed of securities.''
   According to the SEC, companies that engage primarily in
trading, investing and reinvesting securities constitute investment
companies that must by law register with the SEC.
   Dart Group, which is controlled by Herbert Haft and his son
Robert, made a string of hostile attempts for retailers including
Safeway Stores Inc., Supermarkets General Corp., Dayton Hudson
Corp. and, most recently, a $4.32 billion bid for Kroger Co. in
September 1988.
   Dart Group never acquired its targets, but the Hafts profited
handsomely from their stock in the companies and earned reputations
as corporate raiders. Observers questioned whether they were
serious about acquiring a retailer.
   Dart Group, based in Landover, Md., said in a statement it had
resolved the SEC matter and added that it ``is not now an
investment company and does not intend to become an investment
company.''
   The company said it had 1989 sales of more than $900 million
from 575 retail stores such as Trak Auto, Crown Books and Shoppers
Food supermarkets. Dart Group said it also has real estate holdings.
   Rudolph Gerlich Jr., a branch chief with the SEC's enforcement
division, said the case was significant because it showed that even
firms with large operating subsidiaries still can be classified as
investment companies if they meet legal requirements.
   Gerlich warned other companies that the SEC will be ``looking at
your assets and your income and if they are primarily securities,
we won't hesitate to more closely scrutinize the company, and where
appropriate, to require registration as an investment company.''
   In October 1988, Dart disclosed that the SEC was investigating
whether the firm should be forced to register as a company that
invests in securities for a pool of small investors.
   Dart Group was never forced to take that step, but the Hafts
have not made a hostile bid since then.

   An investor group with a 7.26 percent stake in
Harley-Davidson Inc. wants the last U.S. motorcyle maker to get rid
of its recreational vehicle subsidiary.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Wednesday, businessman Malcolm I. Glazer said he sent a letter to
Harley's management suggesting it sell or spin off its Holiday
Rambler Corp. division.
   ``Either transaction would allow Harley-Davidson to concentrate
its efforts on what it does best _ manufacturing motorcycles,''
Glazer said in the Feb. 26 letter to the Milwaukee-based company's
president, Richard F. Teerlink.
   The letter suggested a meeting at Teerlink's office on March 5
to discuss the matter.
   Teerlink rebuffed the request for a meeting.
   ``The future growth of Holiday Rambler offers a significant
long-term opportunity for our shareholders,'' he said in a
statement. ``Therefore, we believe that Holiday Rambler should
remain a part of the company.''
   Glazer, an investor and businessman, with offices in Rochester,
N.Y. and Palm Beach, Fla., revealed last October that he and
members of his family had acquired a 6.24 percent stake in Harley,
the nation's only remaining motorcycle manufacturer.
   At that time. Glazer said he might seek to acquire a controlling
interest or sell off all or part of his group's shares.
   Glazer, in 1988, acquired 9.9 percent of the Formica Corp. at
$12 a share and was rebuffed in a $20-a-share buyout offer before
the laminated products company went private.
   In the letter to Teerlink, Glazer disclosed he now holds 7.26
percent or 626,500 shares of Harley's common stock.
   Glazer's letter said he believed Harley's common shares would be
greatly enhanced if ``the Holiday Rambler division is divested and
the proceeds distributed to shareholders as a special dividend'' or
the division is ``spun off as a publicly traded corporation with
the shares of the new entity being distributed to current
Harley-Davidson shareholders.''
   Holiday Rambler employs about 2,200 in northern Indiana and had
sales of $351.9 million.
   In 1983 the Reagan administration imposed five years of stiff
tariffs against imported motorcycles that had been beating Harley's
product. The tariffs were removed in 1987 after the company
announced it no longer needed protection.

   People who live in the shadow of the
Seabrook nuclear power plant say it's hard to believe a decision on
licensing the reactor is at hand.
   Many are against the plant and say they fear what would happen
if an accident occurred.
   ``I think it's a disgrace,'' said Russ Arscott, a Seabrook
resident for 61 years. ``There's no way to evacuate the area. I
just hope the pipes all hold.''
   Ray Colbert moved to Hampton Beach last year knowing little
about the plant, which he can see across Hampton Harbor from his
porch. He said he plans to move to Florida in May, partly because
of the reactor.
   ``I might stay if that thing wasn't so close,'' he said. But
``I've got a five-month-old daughter. I want to get her the hell
out of here before they fire that thing up.''
   Others look forward to the day the plant finally produces
electricity.
   ``We need it,'' said Thelma Grinnell, a resident of nearby
Salisbury, Mass., for the past 25 years. ``We need something other
than fossil fuels. We're destroying the environment.''
   The years-old controversy about licensing centers on federally
mandated evacuation plans for communities within a 10-mile radius
of the plant, including Salisbury and five others in Massachusetts.
   Opponents say the area around the plant, which is located two
miles from popular Hampton Beach and 40 miles north of Boston, is
too densely populated to be evacuated safely in an emergency.
   ``Anybody who's been in a traffic jam (near the plant) during
the summer knows that in a panic situation, evacuation would be
impossible,'' Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said in a telephone
interview Wednesday.
   ``Why should I have to leave everything I worked for and own
just because of a siren blast from a plant I hate?'' asked Herbert
Sanborn, a 79-year-old Seabrook resident.
   Seabrook proponents, including former New Hampshire governor and
now White House chief of staff John Sununu, say the plans will
work. Sununu refused to comment on Seabrook this week, but his
support was vocal as governor.
   ``It may be a surprise ... but we run the analogy of an
(evacuation) experiment at 7:30 each summer day,'' Sununu said
during a 1983 debate. ``At 7:30 that beach is crowded ... and at 11
at night that beach is empty.''
   Although they disagree on licensing, opponents and proponents
agree that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken too long to
make a decision.
   ``I never thought it would take this long,'' said former Gov.
Meldrim Thomson, a Seabrook proponent who served from 1973-79.
   ``If any human being could dream up anything worse, they would
have to work at it,'' Thomson said. ``We've been told over and over
again that we've built the best and safest plant that's ever been
built. It's ridiculous that it hasn't been licensed.''
   Veteran anti-Seabrook protester Dianne Dunfey was equally
critical of the NRC, but from the other side of the issue.
   The NRC is ``one of the most disreputable of all government
agencies,'' said Dunfey, who was released from jail last week after
serving a five-day term for refusing to pay a fine following a
sit-in at Gov. Judd Gregg's office.
   ``It has ignored public input,'' said Dunfey, who teaches school
in Seabrook. ``It either discarded or amended all of its own
regulations anytime Seabrook couldn't meet one.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Firm Cuts 2,000 More Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The struggling house of Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. said it would lay off 2,000 more workers and acknowledged that
the recession on Wall Street could cost still more jobs at the
nation's No. 2 brokerage.
   Wednesday's move follows 800 job cuts late last year, a senior
management overhaul and $1 billion in capital infusions by parent
American Express Co. to prop up the securities company's financial
position.
   Shearson President Howard L. Clark Jr. said the latest
reductions are part of a broad cost-cutting program that would save
the company $400 million a year. He said a review of the investment
bank's operations could lead to the elimination of certain
businesses and the paring down of others.
   Shearson officials said the latest layoffs, which will be
completed by the end of March, would occur in all divisions.
   ``These steps are necessary to position ourselves for long-term
success in the decade ahead,'' said Clark, a former American
Express executive who took over Shearson last month after the
ouster of Peter A. Cohen, who led the firm's bold expansion in the
1980s.
   Clark said the cost cutting and business review would result in
significant one-time charges that would depress first-quarter
earnings.
   As part of the review, he said Shearson would consider shrinking
or closing down businesses, selling entire units, entering
partnerships in some markets with other Wall Street firms or
expanding in some areas.
   One potential union reportedly failed. Wall Street sources said
American Express and Primerica Corp., parent of Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., held talks about merging some areas to improve
operating efficiency but they ended without a deal this week.
   However, The New York Times reported that talks were continuing
about a possible merger of Shearson and Smith Barney, which would
create the nation's largest brokerage.
   Under a proposed stock-for-assets swap, Primerica would receive
a large portion of American Express' stake in Shearson and the two
companies would be partners as parents of the merged brokerages,
the newspaper said, citing unidentified people involved in the
talks.
   Primerica Chairman Sanford I. Weill, the man who built up
Shearson in the 1970s and sold it to American Express in 1981,
would take over as chairman of Shearson, the Times said.
   The new layoffs would reduce Shearson's work force to 33,500
from a peak of 46,000 in January 1988. The cuts come amid a general
industry slowdown since the October 1987 stock market crash that
has cost more than 40,000 jobs.
   ``Shearson like other firms is readjusting to the new market
realities,'' said John Kriz, a securities industry analyst with
Moody's Investors Service Inc.
   Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Services said he expected
Shearson to cut up to 3,000 more jobs this year and reduce its
reliance on businesses such as investment banking and trading in
favor of retail brokerage.
   The latest cuts came two days after American Express said it
would inject $750 million into Shearson to shore up its finances,
following a $250 million infusion in December. In return, American
Express increased its ownership stake in Shearson.
   Analysts said the injection was designed to quell widespread
rumors on Wall Street about Shearson's financial condition
following the recent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   American Express had planned to shore up Shearson's finances and
reduce its stake in the brokerage to about 45 percent from 61
percent under a complex recapitalization plan involving the issue
of $250 million of new Shearson stock. But weak market conditions
forced the company to abandon the offering.
   Long estimated the new infusion would give American Express
about 72 percent of Shearson. But he said if Shearson's financial
position improves, the parent still would need to consider whether
to sell the firm, spin it off to shareholders or assume 100 percent
ownership.

<TEXT>
   Some previously indicted traders in the Japanese
yen pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the soybean pit at
the Chicago Board of Trade have been indicted on additional counts.
   The added charges come as part of a wide-ranging federal
undercover investigation at the exchanges, which has resulted in
the indictments of 48 people, including a clerk.
   On Wednesday, assistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Gillogly filed
superseding indictments against 16 Japanese yen traders and 13
soybean traders who were originally indicted last August.
   Sources told the Chicago Sun-Times and the Chicago Tribune that
prosecutors were able to broaden and refine the original
indictments because of information they received from cooperating
defendants.
   The traders are charged with violating the Commodities Exchange
Act, lying to a federal agency and mail and wire fraud.
   The superseding indictments added eight new counts to charges
against those in the yen pit, bringing the total to 393 counts.
Those charged in the Soybean Pit now face a total of 734 counts.
   Trial for the yen traders is expected to begin May 21 before
U.S. District Judge William Hart. The accused soybean traders are
scheduled to go on trial June 12 before U.S. District Judge George
Marovich.

<HEAD>Exxon Officials `Hiding Behind Corporate Cloak,' Environmentalist
Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs graf 10, To win, to CORRECT ``felony convictions'' to

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While environmentalists generally praise the
criminal indictment of Exxon Corp. in the massive Alaskan oil
spill, some are bemoaning the fact that no individual corporate
officials were charged.
   ``There are some people hiding behind the corporate cloak,''
Erik Olson, an attorney for the Natural Wildlife Federation, said
Wednesday. ``If you are not punishing the individuals, you are only
punishing some ethereal corporate, artificial entity.''
   But proving criminal legal violations against individuals would
be much more difficult than bringing charges against the
corporation and its subsidiary, Exxon Shipping Co., legal experts
say.
   ``A corporation doesn't act through one person but may act
through a combination of individuals. So no one of them had a
requisite criminal intent,'' said Norman Bernstein, a Washington
environmental lawyer who represents large corporations.
   The company's failure ``may be in a sense the failure of the
system, a combination of people's judgments rather than one
individual consciously saying, `I don't really care about the
intentional grounding of this ship,''' Bernstein said.
   A federal grand jury in Alaska handed up a five-count criminal
indictment against Exxon on Tuesday in the 10-million-gallon spill
by the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound on
March 24.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh didn't rule out the possibility
of more charges, telling reporters the investigation was
continuing. His statement Tuesday indicated that prosecutors may be
trying to determine if there is evidence to charge individuals.
   Responsibility often is so fragmented in large corporations that
it is difficult to prove that a series of individuals knowingly
committed crimes, said Judson W. Starr, former head of the Justice
Department's environmental crimes unit.
   But criminal behavior is ``easier to prove against corporations.
They can accumulate bits and pieces of knowledge,'' Starr said.
   To win convictions on the two felony charges it has brought, the
Justice Department must prove that Exxon ``willfully and
knowingly'' failed to ensure the Exxon Valdez was manned by crew
members capable of safely operating the tanker.
   The ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, is on trial in Anchorage
on state charges arising from the spill, including operating a
vessel while intoxicated.
   In the days before Tuesday's indictment, the Justice Department
endured a storm of criticism from Alaskan officials and
environmental groups after reports it was about to reach a
plea-bargain agreement with Exxon.
   Alaskan officials charged the settlement would have compromised
the state's civil suit against the oil company.
   But Assistant Attorney General Richard B. Stewart defended the
government's handling of the negotiations, denying claims that it
might have agreed to a settlement that would have allowed Exxon to
avoid its responsibility for the cleanup.
   In its dealings with Exxon over several months, the department
always insisted on ``a guilty plea to serious charges'' and ``very,
very substantial fines, entirely unprecedented in the environmental
context,'' Stewart said Wednesday.
   The proposal was tailored ``to deal with an unresolved and
developing situation,'' he said. ``It will be many years before we
have a full understanding of the extent of the damage.''
   The government proposed requiring Exxon to pay $150 million ``up
front'' to finance pilot restoration projects and environmental
studies to assess ways of repairing the damage, he said.
   Once that phase was completed, Exxon also would have been
required to pay up to $500 million as demanded by federal trustees
to finish the cleanup, Stewart said.
   If that amount proved insufficient, the government would have
been free after four years to file civil suits to get more money.
   The Justice Department showed the proposal to Alaskan officials
at Exxon's request because the company did not want to be in a
position of paying twice for the same cleanup, Stewart said.
   The government made changes to accommodate concerns raised by
Alaska, he said, adding that the proposal was rejected by both
Alaska and Exxon.

<HEAD>Book: Iacocca Tried Coup While at Ford</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lee Iacocca, while president of Ford Motor Co.,
tried to stage a coup by saying then-Ford Chairman Henry Ford II
was senile and incapable of running the nation's No. 2 automaker, a
new book says.
   The book by former Ford executive Walter Hayes said Iacocca, now
chairman of Chrysler Corp., made the move while Ford was traveling
in China in 1978. Later that year, Iacocca was fired by Ford,
grandson of the company's founder, became Chrysler's president and
rose to chairman in 1979.
   The biography of Ford, who died Sept. 29, 1987, is to be
published in June. Review copies of ``Henry: A Memoir of Henry Ford
II,'' were distributed Wednesday.
   Hayes, who retired as vice chairman of Ford of Europe last year,
said Iacocca met with Ford directors George Bennett and Joseph
Cullman and ``argued that Henry, still not 60 years of age, was
senile and not up to the job and indicated that there were others
in the company who shared his opinion.''
   Ford learned of the meeting, the book said, and ``did not
believe it, but it took little detective work to persuade him that
what he had heard was true. Lee Iacocca wanted to take the company
away from him and, more astonishingly, seemed to think he could do
it.''
   A spokesman for Iacocca said the account was untrue. Iacocca
could not be reached for comment. Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris
did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment today.
   In his accounts of the late 1970s, Iacocca said his efforts to
change Ford were repeatedly rebuffed by Henry Ford.
   ``He (Ford) hated firing people,'' according to Hayes' book.
``That is why he did it so badly.
   ``From the day he made up his mind to replace Lee, it took him
three years and an act of insubordination to stiffen his sinews
sufficiently to do the deed.''

   Personal income, boosted in part by a federal
employee pay raise, rose 0.8 percent in January while consumer
spending increased 0.6 percent, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said incomes totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $4.60 trillion after rising 0.5 percent in
December.
   ``The January increase was boosted by cost-of-living adjustments
to several federal transfer payment programs and by a pay raise for
federal government employees,'' the department said.
   The 3.6 percent federal pay raise added $3.5 billion at an
annual rate to government payrolls.
   The January income boost was offset somewhat by an increase in
personal contributions for social insurance programs and by a
decrease in subsidy payments to farmers.
   Consumer spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
$3.60 trillion following a 0.6 percent gain in December.
   Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of economic
health because it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity.
   The report showed that Americans' incomes after taxes rose 0.9
percent, up from December's 0.4 percent gain.
   Americans' savings rate, savings as a percent of disposable
income, rose 5.9 percent against December's 5.5 percent increase.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
edged up $16.2 billion in January following a $16.8 billion gain in
December.
   Payrolls at manufacturing companies, hit hardest by the Federal
Reserve's high-interest policies, fell $2.1 billion after a $200
million increase in December.
   On the spending side, the $19.9 billion increase in personal
consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on
debt, was down from December's $36.7 billion advance.
   Purchases of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ rose $24.3 billion, while purchases of
non-durable goods edged up $2.5 billion. Spending on services fell
$6.8 billion.

   The roar of Eastern Airlines jets overhead means
Harold Echols is selling yogurt again.
   A year ago, Echols and his concession stands at Atlanta's
Hartsfield international airport were hit hard by the Eastern
strike that prompted a temporary shutdown of the airline and took a
multimillion-dollar bite out of the local economy.
   The strike by Eastern Machinists, pilots and flight attendants,
which began March 4, 1989, emptied all of Concourse C and half of
Concourse B at Hartsfield.
   For Echols, whose Airport International Concessions Inc. runs a
variety of shops, the grounding of Eastern translated into an
immediate 32 percent drop in sales, weekly losses exceeding $40,000
and several layoffs through the early months of the strike.
   ``We couldn't do a thing about it,'' Echols said. ``Just pray
and look for better times.''
   Now that Eastern planes are flying again, Echols and others at
the world's second busiest airport are much happier. Indeed, the
airport itself has recently reclaimed the ``second busiest'' title
(to Chicago's O'Hare International), which it briefly surrendered
in the depths of the strike.
   Miami-based Eastern began rebuilding last fall with Hartsfield
as the center of its operations. The pilots and flight attendants
ended their strike in November. For the time being, Eastern
concourses are busy again with passengers and employees.
   Eastern Machinists continue to picket at Hartsfield, a constant
reminder they're still on strike. But the airport and the city of
Atlanta seem to have withstood the shock.
   ``Initially it was a sizable impact, but it was very
short-lived,'' said Jim Cranford, Hartsfield's business manager.
``They're flying less flights but not that much less than
pre-strike because they've slowly come back.''
   Cranford said in the three years prior to the strike, Eastern
contributed about $25 million annually to the airport's operations,
including payments for such things as terminal rental, security,
landing fees and insurance. Now, that figure is closer to $22
million.
   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines, the No. 1 carrier at Hartsfield
with about 50 percent of the airport's traffic, contributes more
than $30 million annually, Cranford said.
   Eastern currently owes the airport about $1.6 million in
pre-strike bills, but that money is frozen because of the airline's
bankruptcy court proceedings, Cranford said. The airline also owes
about $1.1 million for February, he said, but it has been paying
bills promptly since starting up after the strike.
   The airline says it currently has 270 departures a day out of
Atlanta, compared to 289 daily right before the strike.
   ``The worrisome question is, will they succeed in the long
run?'' said airport spokesman John Braden.
   ``Eastern is so ingrained in Atlanta,'' Braden said. ``They were
born here. Eastern was established here before Delta. We consider
them an Atlanta airline, so we'd hate to see them leave from the
standpoint that they're ours.''
   Donald Ratajczak, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at
Georgia State University's College of Business Administration, said
the local economy has begun to climb back from the jolt caused last
spring by the strike, which took a big payroll bite worth $700
million annually.
   Ratajczak said Atlanta hasn't totally recovered.
   ``The new Eastern doesn't have the same economic clout as
before,'' he said. ``But it's sure better than it was last March.''

Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford
suggested today that Poland is a candidate for reduction of the $10
billion it owes to banks under the plan proposed by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   Mulford told a congressional panel that he and Brady were in
Poland last weekend and that the question of reducing Poland's debt
is under discussion.
   He noted that Mexico has just signed an agreement with creditor
banks, the first negotiated under the Brady strategy.
   Mulford also said that Poland has just made another agreement to
delay payments on the $27 billion that it owes to creditor
governments, including the United States.
   Poland has a total debt of more than $40 billion.
   Mulford was testifying before the subcommittee on international
organizations of the banking committee in the House of
Representatives.

   Prices dipped lower on Wall Street today after
two reports indicated little change in the economy.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 4.28 to 2,2622.97 as
of 11 a.m. EST.
   Advancing issues were slightly ahead of decliners with 590
stocks up, 629 down and 498 unchanged on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Big Board volume came to 52 million shares after the first 90
minutes of trading.
   The government reported today that personal income, boosted in
part by a federal employee pay raise rose 0.8 percent in January
while consumer spending increased 0.6 percent.
   Meanwhile, a survey of the nation's purchasing executives
indicated that the manufacturing economy declined in February for
the 10th consecutive month, but at the lowest rate since last June.
   Analysts said the reports by themselves did not affect stocks
and that Wall Street took its cue from the negative reaction on the
bond market, where the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was off
about $2.50 for each $1,000 in face value.
   The bond's yield, considered an indicator of the direction for
interest rates, rose to 8.56 percent from late Wednesday's 8.53
percent.
   The financial markets believe reports indicating little change
in the economy will not prompt the Federal Reserve to nudge
interest rates lower.
   Traders said the market shrugged off another sharp loss on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
762.41 points, or 2.20 percent, today, closing at 33,829.58, but
there again was no perceivable impact in New York.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Union Carbide,
which fell 1| to 22| after deciding not to undertake a major
restructuring.
   Among othe blue chip stocks, Philip Morris was down \ at 36},
Exxon was unchanged at 47, and American Express fell \ to 28~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks fell 0.09 to
182.98. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was
off 0.03 to 352.87.

   Florida citrus baron Ben Hill Griffin,
listed in Forbes magazine as one of the 400 richest Americans, died
at his home today after a long illness. He was 79.
   His secretary, Donna Respress, said Griffin died early today.
She had no other details, but said services would be announced
later today.
   Forbes' October 1989 issue put him 261st on the list of wealthy
Americans, and said he was worth $390 million.
   Griffin was a Democratic member of the Florida Legislature for
12 years, serving in both the House and Senate between 1956 and
1968. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1974, losing to the
incumbent, Reubin Askew.
   Griffin studied agriculture at the University of Florida in the
early 1930s and went on to become the school's largest benefactor.
His gifts totaled $14.7 million.
   Griffin started his citrus empire in 1933, when his father gave
him 10 acres of groves as a wedding present. His company, Ben Hill
Griffin Inc., owned more than 10,000 acres of citrus groves and
85,000 acres of ranch and timberland in Central Florida.
   The Griffin family sold its packinghouses and a huge juice
processing plant to Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in 1981, which introduced
its juice under the Citrus Hill brand name.
   Doug Bournique, executive vice president of the Indian River
Citrus League, described Griffin as one who ``personifies the
citrus spirit, the citrus legacy in the state of Florida.''
   Last year, Hill resigned as president but remained as chief
executive of publicly held Alico Inc., which controls more than
175,000 acres of Florida land managed of leased for various uses,
including rock mining, oil and mineral exploration and citrus
production.
   Both companies are now headed by his son, Ben Hill Griffin III.

<HEAD>Du Pont Agrees To Build $1 Billion Complex In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont and the Spanish government are to
invest $1 billion over the next 12 years to build a high-tech
industrial complex in the northern region of Asturias under an
agreement signed Thursday.
   Industry Minister Claudio Aranzadi said Spain agreed to put up
$300 million, not counting an undisclosed sum by the Asturian
regional government, to win the complex, which is to employ 1,000
people in the hard-pressed region by 2001.
   Du Pont Chairman Edgar S. Woolard, Jr. said the complex, to be
inaugurated in 1993 with a $200 billion Nomex fiber plant, would
produce a range of chemicals, fibers and polymer products for the
fast-growing European market.
   ``We will bring some of our highest-technology, most specialized
products into this site with the objective of supplying the entire
European market,'' said Woolard, who signed the agreement with
Aranzadi.
   He said the project would further Du Pont's goal of doubling its
annual $5 billion European sales of chemicals, plastics and fibers
over the next decade.
   Both Aranzadi and Woolard said they expected the eventual
investment to exceed the agreed-upon $1 billion and added the
presence of Du Pont would act as a magnet for small- and mid-sized
companies making finished products.
   Even without the additional companies, Du Pont Iberica Chairman
German Lastra said, the complex could be expected to indirectly
create an additional 4,000 to 5,000 jobs in the area.
   The site of the complex is in the Tamon Valley, 6 kilometers
(3.7 miles) from the city of Aviles, which is near the Atlantic
Ocean.
   Woolard said it would be at least six months before the company
would decide on the product to follow Nomex, an aramid fiber used
in aerospace and protective clothing now made exclusively at a Du
Pont plant in Richmond, Virginia.
   But he said the company's commitment to the overall project was
firm.
   ``Du Pont would not be opening this site if there were any
possibility that we were going to build Nomex and stop. It would
not be of interest to us,'' Woolard said.
   Construction on the Nomex plant is to begin in August, with
production expected to start at the start of 1993, Woolard said.
The plant is to employ 300 people.
   Du Pont Iberica now concentrates mostly on marketing in Spain
and Portugal, where it employs 300 people and had sales last year
of $200 million, the company said.
   In Europe, Du Pont employs 20,000 people in 14 countries, and
registered $11 billion in sales last year, company officials said.

<HEAD>Appellate Court Extends Sentence For Immigrant Tycoon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Appellate Court Thursday upheld the
conviction and stiffened the sentence of Refaat El-Sayed for fraud
and insider trading in the biggest white-collar case ever to reach
a S instead
of the five years earlier imposed.
   The court acquitted Gaston Portofaix, the financial manager of
El Sayed's former company Fermenta AB, on four counts of swindling.
   A district court found El-Sayed guilty last July on 14 counts of
swindling investers, perjury, insider trading and fraud.
   He told reporters after Thursday's verdict that he was a
scapegoat for the board of his failed company. ``That, and maybe
the fact that I did not fall on my knees, cry and say I have
wronged, forgive me, may be the reason why I'm convicted in this
way,'' he said.
   El-Sayed, who immigrated in 1964, parlayed his 1981 purchase of
the failing biotechnical company Fermenta into a financial empire.
   His success began to unravel when it was discovered his claim to
gave a doctorate degree was phony. The disclosure led to a closer
look at the company's transactions, and El-Sayed was found to have
put misleading information in annual reports to improve the
company's profits and credibility.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after
rallying in the previous session.
   Soybean traders were looking for direction after a fairly strong
runup Wednesday. Prices were fractionally higher in early trading
but buying interest was limited by reports of increased farmer
selling of soybeans after Wednesday's close and by slack European
demand for soybean meal.
   Corn futures were fractionally higher, boosted by news that
Mexico bought about 188,000 metric tons of U.S. corn overnight.
   The wheat market was down slightly, pressured by a lack of
significant new export business and by forecasts for more
precipitation today in some winter wheat areas.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.90{ a bushel; corn

<HEAD>Beech Aircraft Corp. Destroys Prototype Of Revolutionary Airplane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prototype of a revolutionary Beech
Aircraft Corp. plane has met a controversial death in the
California desert where it emerged.
   Ignoring the pleas of at least one aviation museum and the
airplane's designer, Beech has destroyed the original, experimental
version of its Starship business aircraft.
   Because of its graphite and epoxy all-composite construction and
its futuristic design, the Starship has attracted much attention
since the original model was unveiled in 1983.
   Some observers said Beech's action reflected the acrimony that
exists between top Beech officials and innovative aircraft designer
Burt Rutan, who had a major role in the design of the Starship and
whose company built the experimental model.
   A demolition crew hired by Wichita-based Beech broke up the
85-percent scale ``proof-of-concept'' model of the Starship last
week. It was being stored in hangar at the Mojave, Calif., airport
where it was built and first flown in 1983.
   A Beech official said Tuesday dismemberment was the usual fate
for experimental models.
   ``We were done with it. It had served its purpose,'' said
spokesman Mike Potts.
   The Experimental Aviation Association, which maintains an air
museum in Oshkosh, Wis., had asked Beech to turn the aircraft over
to the museum. The company refused.
   ``We did not believe the airplane was representative of what we
ultimately built and certified,'' Potts said, citing many changes
in design and construction that were made in the Starship before
commercial production began. Potts also said the plane was not in
display condition.
   But EAA President Tom Poberezny said the original Starship model
had historic significance, whatever its condition.
   In addition to having a major role in the original design,
Rutan's company, Scaled Composites, built the experimental model.
   Rutan said the subject of what to do with the experimental model
came up a year ago, when Beech officials indicated they wanted to
destroy it.
   ``We got back to them and told them there was nobody here that
would take a hammer to it,'' Rutan said.
   When he heard the plane was going to be demolished, Rutan said
he talked to Beech President Max Bleck ``who told me it was none of
my business.''
   Last fall, Bleck told one industry trade publication that key
design and construction problems Beech encountered in developing
the Starship for commercial sale were caused largely by inaccurate
data gleaned from Rutan's experimental model.
   Rutan is widely known for his innovative aircraft designs,
including the Voyager aircraft that flew around the world non-stop
without refueling in 1986 and a new all-composite, low cost
military aircraft designed to provide close air support to ground
troops. The latter plane was unveiled Monday.
   At one point, Rutan was an employee of Beech, which bought
Scaled Composites in 1985 and launched several other experimental
aircraft development programs. Then in 1988, the year after Bleck
became president of Beech, the company was sold back to Rutan.
   Wayman-Gordon, a firm headed by former Beech president James
Walsh, now owns Scaled Composites, where Rutan continues work on
experimental aircraft.

<HEAD>From Variety to Specialty, Woolworth Not Just a Nickel and Dime

<TEXT>
   For Woolworth Corp., America's shopping malls
are like hundreds of laboratories, where it tests ideas to create
new national chains that specialize in merchandise ranging from
costume jewelry to running shoes.
   The retailer once known for dowdy dimestores that sell trinkets
and doodads has become the owner of an unusually wide variety of
stores. It isn't just the owner of variety stores.
   Woolworth's powerhouse of more than 40 different specialty
chains is paced by its all-star Foot Locker. Analysts say the
company may have more of what it will take to outrun the
competition than any other big American retailer.
   A record of 29 straight quarterly profit improvements
illustrates the New York-based company's successful retailing
science.
   This past week Woolworth reported record earnings for the fourth
quarter and full year. In 1989, the company earned $329 million, or
$5.11 a share, up 14 percent from $288 million, or $4.47 a share,
in 1988. Revenue rose 9.1 percent to $8.82 billion from $8.09
billion.
   Harold E. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer, said
Woolworth will follow a proven formula in trying to keep the streak
alive.
   ``We feel we know the specialty store business as well if not
better than any other retailer in the world. That's what we're
going to stick to _ what we know best,'' he said in an interview.
   The company constantly examines properties to see if they meet
the rigorous standards necessary to join the fold, maybe taking a
serious look at a couple a month.
   Candidates must have the potential to go nationwide and have
better financial performances than the corporation's overall goals
of a 13 percent return on investment and a 20 percent annual return
on beginning common equity.
   Acquisitions in recent years have been small, of about 100
stores or fewer each. Sells said bigger deals could be forthcoming.
   ``Our balance sheet is very strong today. We have the capability
of doing a major acquisition if the opportunity did present
itself,'' he said.
   But don't look for Woolworth to go after any department stores
currently on the block, such as the upscale Saks or Marshall Fields.
   ``We have no plans at all to become interested in any of the
chains that are on the market today,'' said Sells.
   Areas in which Woolworth does have interest include anything to
do with serving an aging population, health and beauty aids and
deep discount drugs, where it already has a presence with its Rx
Place stores. Woolworth's apparel operations were restructured
recently to accomodate a possible acquisition.
   What Woolworth seems to excel at is devising its own concepts or
spinning strings of small stores by linking existing chains. New
free-standing shops are evolved from individual departments in its
variety stores.
   Afterthoughts, for example, a retailer of costume jewelry,
handbags and accessories, is one of Woolworth's successful
specialty retailers and it sprung from the variety stores.
   Champs Sports, a sporting goods retailer, was the offspring of a
union of two Florida-based chains. Over the past two years
Woolworth has expanded Champs to 199 stores from 90 when the match
was made. Sells said by 2000, there should be 1,000 Champs dotted
throughout almost every major U.S. mall.
   ``Landlords love it because of the size,'' Sells said, noting
that mall owners who want a sporting goods tenant but don't want to
commit huge amounts of space prefer to lease to Champs, which packs
an assortment of athletic merchandise into about 4,500 square feet.
   Sells, an Arkansas native who began his retailing career in 1945
at the Kinney Shoe Corp., which Woolworth acquired in 1963, said
the company tries to cultivate an entrepreneurial spirit.
   ``We encourage our operating people in the divisions to come up
with new ideas _ a new niche of specialty store retailing that we
may not be in today but we feel there's an opportunity,'' said
Sells.
   If Sells and a handful of colleagues approve, the concept gets
tested. In this phase Woolworth opens about five stores, investing
a couple of hundred thousand dollars in each. After a year to two,
Woolworth decides whether it has a winner.
   ``For a million dollars we can do this experiment,'' Sells said.
``We consider that our R and D money.'' A mall, he said, is ``like
our laboratory.''
   Not all experiments work out well. Last year Woolworth gave the
heave-ho to two unprofitable duds: Frame Scene, a retailer of
prints and frames, and Face Fantasies, a bargain-priced cosmetics
outlet.
   Woolworth makes the best of its flops by refilling the retail
space with more promising concepts, said Sells.
   Kurt Barnard, a New York-based retail consultant, said much of
Woolworth's strength lies in its clout with landlords and
streamlined buying ability.
   Having numerous popular stores within the same mall gives
Woolworth an advantage in negotiating leases. Having stores with
overlapping focuses _ for instance Afterthoughts and Woolworth
variety stores _ makes ordering inventory more efficient and
economical.
   If Woolworth has had a weakness it could be the
five-and-ten-cent stores operated by the century-old-plus general
merchandise division. The company has recognized its shortcoming;
about 200 U.S. Woolworths were closed in the second half of the
1980s and many of the rest were renovated and remerchandised.
   A smaller, leaner version of the variety stores _ pared to core
brisk sellers such as budget cosmetics, greeting cards, candies and
seasonal items like Christmas decorations and Halloween masks _
have become familiar mall inhabitants. Woolworth Express shops do
$250 to $300 per square foot in sales and average about 6,000
square feet in size. The regular variety stores, averaging 17,000
square feet, did $110 in sales per square foot in 1988.
   In the future, one real plus for Woolworth is its experience
outside its home turf. It runs stores in Australia, Canada and West
Germany.
   Woolworth has a toehold in Europe that could prove beneficial.
Foot Locker has the muscle to become the dominant sports shoe chain
in Europe, as it is in the United States, analysts say.
   Before World War II Woolworth ran 32 stores in what is now East
Germany and Poland. The stores were taken over by the government.
Sells said the company is awaiting the outcome of March 18
elections in East Germany and if signs are favorable Woolworth will
try to open for business there again.
   ``We have somewhat of an advantage,'' Sells said. ``People
remember the Woolworth name.''

   Woolworth Corp., formed last June as the holding
company for the 111-year-old F.W. Woolworth Co., also is the parent
of dozens of specialty retail chains operating in the United States
and abroad.
   The company, from its headquarters in a historic landmark
building in Manhattan, oversees an empire of mostly small stores.
Many evolved after Woolworth undertook a major corporate
reconfiguration in the early 1980s.
   ``Woolworth restructured before it became a buzzword,'' Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Harold E. Sells says.
   In one stroke, Woolworth closed 372 struggling Woolco discount
department stores in the United States. It shed a 52.5 percent
stake in Woolworth in the United Kingdom. At the same time, ``We
decided to explode our specialty store concept,'' Sells says.
   The Foot Locker chain of athletic shoe stores was launched in
1974 by Woolworth's Kinney Shoe Corp. division. Kinney had joined
the Woolworth fold 11 years earlier.
   Foot Locker became the leading growth vehicle for Woolworth in
the 1980s.
   By the end of last year, more than 1,300 Foot Lockers were
operating worldwide, up from around 200 at the start of the decade.
Sales at Foot Locker reached an estimated $1.2 billion in 1989.
   Its success spawned Lady Foot Locker, designed to attract women
who might have been put off by the male-oriented jock approach of
Foot Locker. The two begat Kids Foot Locker. There are now 511 Lady
Foot Lockers in the United States and Canada and 23 the junior
version.
   The popularity of Foot Locker and its offspring coincided with a
boom in fitness that has shown staying power.
   ``It will continue to be strong in the '90s and into the next
century,'' Sells predicts. He notes that Foot Locker isn't
dependent on sports fanatics for business; an estimated 80 percent
of all shoes sold in a Foot Locker aren't sold for a specific sport.
   Woolworth intends to extend its Foot Locker chain in Europe,
where it already is operating in West Germany. The acquisition, now
in the final stages, of Profoot Nederland BV assets will further
Foot Locker's expansion plans. Profoot, selling sports shoes and
apparel, has 10 stores in the Netherlands and 4 in Belgium.
   Here are brief descriptions of some other chains that are pieces
of the retailing company that got its start when Frank Winfield
Woolworth opened a five-and-ten-cent store in Lancaster, Penn., in
1879:
   _Afterthoughts, made up of 349 boutiques, sells costume jewelry,
handbags and other accessories. It operates under the name Rubins
in West Germany.
   _Champs Sports is a 199-store chain of athletic goods stores.
The company expects to open these shops aggressively in the 1990s
and have around 1,000 of them by 2000.
   _Herald Square Party Shops carry party goods, greeting cards and
stationery at 26 stores.
   _Kids Mart-Little Folk shops are low-priced brand-name infants'
and children's apparel chains of 435 stores.
   _Raglans is a unisex casual apparel 42-store chain in Canada.
   _Richman Brothers and Anderson-Little stores sell men's and
women's apparel and furnishings in 288 stores.
   _Susie's is a chain of 224 women's clothing stores in the United
States.

   Employees rallied in support of their Nordstrom
bosses today and announced a decertification campaign against a
union that has sued the fashion retailer over alleged violations of
wage and hour laws.
   About 250 people attended the rally outside Nordstrom's flagship
store one day after the suit by two United Food &amp; Commercial
Workers locals and five current and former Nordstrom employees.
   The suit was filed in King County Superior Court on behalf of
approximately 50,000 present and former company workers in
Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, Utah and Alaska.
   It was the second class-action suit in as many days. The first
was filed by shareholders who said Nordstrom should have known the
wage and hour problems would hurt the company's earnings.
   The effort to remove UFCW Locals 1001 and 367 as bargaining
agent for about 1,500 Nordstrom workers in the Seattle-Tacoma area
was announced today at the pro-company rally at Westlake Plaza.
   Dozens attending the rally carried signs saying ``Nobody Asked
Me _ I Support Nordstrom'' and chanted, ``One, two, three, four. No
more union any more,'' and ``We love Nordstrom.''
   Marv Treadwell, who works in the men's suits department in
Tacoma, said petitions calling for an election on whether to retain
representation by Local 367 had been signed by 40 percent of the
workers eligible to vote at his store.
   Greg Helean, a women's shoe sales clerk in Bellevue, said
similar petitions would be circulated starting today in Seattle.
   On Tuesday three Nordstrom shareholders filed suit in U.S.
District Court, claiming they and other stockholders suffered
financial losses because of the pay problems and that company
officers failed to disclose those problems.
   Nationally, Nordstrom has 60 stores and employs about 30,000.
   Local 1001 president Joe Peterson said in a telephone interview
that union officials were preparing more complaints accusing the
company of unfair labor practices after getting numerous complaints
of management pressure to sign petitions supporting Nordstrom,
attend the rally and support a decertification campaign.
   Larry McCarger, assistant to the regional director of the
National Labor Relations Board, said the decertification petitions
probably would not be considered until pending unfair labor
practice complaints are resolved _ a process that could take three
months or longer.
   The board also could dismiss the petitions if they are found to
be the result of company violations of labor laws or regulations,
McCarger said.
   Nordstrom has a near-legendary reputation for customer service,
with polite and attentive sales clerks, a no-questions-asked return
policy, and personal notes from employees to good customers.
   But on Feb. 15, the Washington Department of Labor and
Industries ruled Nordstrom had violated state laws by failing to
pay some employees for time worked outside normal working hours.
   The state, acting on a UFCW complaint, said workers had not been
properly compensated for such things as attending meetings,
delivering merchandise to other stores and customers, doing
inventory work or writing thank-you notes.
   In releasing its annual earnings Monday, Nordstrom said it had
made a $15 million provision for expected back pay claims by
employees and adopted a procedure to handle the claims. The charge
against fourth-quarter earnings was cited by the company as one
reason why profits fell 34 percent in the period ending Jan. 31.
   Peterson called the $15 million too little and threatened the
suit if Nordstrom failed to negotiate a back-pay settlement with
the union.
   Nordstrom said claims forms had been sent to sales clerks in
states other than Washington. In Washington the forms must be
reviewed by the state's labor office and by the two union locals.

   Share prices finished lower Thursday after a
dreary session on London's Stock Exchange, pushed down by a poor
performance earlier in Tokyo and an uninspiring start on Wall
Street.
   Trading got off to a rocky start in the wake of the news of
another dramatic drop in Tokyo. This sent the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index below the key 2,250 level from which it
was not able to recover.
   Wall Street's early performance made matters worse, market
watchers said. By the close of the London day, the Dow Jones
industrial average was off 0.67 point at 2,626.58.
   Traders described the market as quiet and featureless.
   ``It's one of the worst days for business in recent memory,''
one London dealer said. ``I've spoken with dealers all over the
city and we're all in the same boat.''
   At the London close, the FT-SE 100-share index was 17 points, or
0.8 percent, lower at 2,238.4, close to its session low of 2,236.0.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 16.5 points to close at
1,764.9. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 9.12 points to
close at 1,215.89.
   Volume came to a light 376.9 million shares, little changed from
365.9 million shares Wednesday.

<HEAD>Perrier to Unveil New Campaign, First Bottles Seen at Soccer Match</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Perrier will unveil plans to relaunch its sparkling
water worldwide next week, the company said Thursday after giving
soccer fans a sneak preview of bottles filled since benzene
contamination prompted a global recall two weeks ago.
   Anne Lamour, a spokeswoman for Source Perrier SA, refused to say
whether new cases of the popular drink would be shipped around the
world simultaneously or sent a few at a time to the 120 countries
affected by the recall.
   No specific date has been set for the announcement of the plan
and details of new production methods.
   The company has increased production at Perrier's spring at
Vergeze in southern France, but Mrs. Lamour declined to say whether
160 million new bottles had been filled to replace recalled stocks.
   Perrier had issued a statement on Monday that its water could
return to stores within two months, once the company implemented
new procedures to prevent a recurrence of the contamination.
   Perrier withdrew 72 million bottles from the United States
markets in early February after traces of benzene were discovered
in Perrier samples from several markets. The recall was expanded
worldwide on Feb. 14 after contamination was found in other
countries.
   The naturally occuring benzene entered Perrier's bottling line
when workers failed to replace a filter carrying carbon dioxide gas
from the underground spring to the bottling plant, executives said.
   About 22,000 soccer fans got the first public glimpse of Perrier
bottled since the recall during a soccer match Wednesday between
France and West Germany.
   Company repesentatives displayed two cases of the pear-shaped,
1-liter bottles with green letters reading ``nouvelle production,''
but the water was not for sale.
   When the recall was announced, Perrier executives said it might
take 2{ months to restock shelves with untainted water.
   Mrs. Lamour said original estimates have proven correct that the
recall would put a $35 million dent in Perrier's profits.
   Perrier sent a telex to domestic distributors last week saying
they would receive new bottles March 1, but Mrs. Lamour said that
date has been pushed back to at least next week.
   The French recall has been voluntary. The company asked
distributors to return the bottles to Vergeze for cleaning and
refilling or to destroy them on site.
   Mrs. Lamour said about 48 million of the 50 million bottles on
French shelves before the recall have been accounted for, with a
quarter of those refilled.

   Prices advanced on Wall Street today as the
stock market shook off dim prospects for a drop in interest rates.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 15.54 to 2,642.79 as of
noon EST.
   Advancing issues were ahead of decliners by a margin of about 5
to 3 with 853 stocks up, 555 down and 477 unchanged on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Big Board volume came to 114.60 million shares in mid-afternoon.
   The government reported that personal income, boosted in part by
a federal employee pay raise, rose 0.8 percent in January while
consumer spending increased 0.6 percent.
   Meanwhile, a survey of the nation's purchasing executives
indicated that the manufacturing economy declined in February for
the 10th consecutive month, but at the lowest rate since last June.
   Financial markets believed the reports would not prompt the
Federal Reserve to nudge interest rates lower.
   The bond market responded negatively, with the Treasury's
bellwether 30-year bond off about $3.75 for each $1,000 in face
value. Wall Street initially took its cue from the reaction among
bond traders, but then began to move ahead on its own.
   Traders said the market also shrugged off another sharp loss on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
762.41 points, or 2.20 percent, today, closing at 33,829.58, but
there again was no perceivable impact in New York.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Union Carbide,
which fell 1~ to 22&rsqb; after the company deciding not to undertake a
major restructuring.
   Philip Morris was down \ at 36}, Exxon was down &lsqb; at 46~, and
American Express fell &lsqb; to 29.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose 1.11 to
184.18. On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was
up 1.02 to 353.92.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it would not pursue a
criminal prosecution in connection with the 1985 takeover of
Harrods' owner House of Fraser PLC by the Al-Fayed brothers.
   The decision by the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of
Public Prosecutions comes after a 20-month investigation.
   It was a major setback for Roland ``Tiny'' Rowland, the Lonrho
PLC chairman who was a rival bidder for Harrods. He has waged a
long, expensive and very public campaign to have the 615
million-pound ($1 billion) takeover reversed.
   At one point during the bitter feud, House of Fraser Chairman
Mohamed Al-Fayed said ``only God'' would take the world-renowned
department store away from him.
   The authorities also said they had dropped their objection to
the publication of a report resulting from a Department of Trade
and Industry investigation into the takeover.
   Trade Secretary Nicholas Ridley said in a written reply to a
question in the House of Commons that he would publish the report
on Wednesday. ``I do not intend to take any further action,'' he
said.
   Lonrho said Thursday that it welcomed what it called the
``overdue'' decision to publish the report. ``When the public and
the City sees the contents of the report, there will be a demand
for action. Lonrho is not permitted to comment on the report until
it is published. Lonrho will then make its views clear.''
   The City is London's financial district.
   Lonrho, which has failed in its repeated attempts to have the
takeover referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, had
pressed for the release of the report, which it says supports its
criticisms of the Al-Fayeds.
   Lonrho repeatedly has alleged that the Al-Fayeds misrepresented
their background and wealth to win Harrods, allegations which they
have denied.
   A year ago, Lonrho published what it said were extracts from the
trade department's report in a special midweek edition of its
Sunday newspaper The Observer. The trade department immediately
blocked its circulation.
   The trade secretary at the time, Lord Young, said he wanted to
publish the report but that he had been asked by the Serious Fraud
Office not to divulge details, to avoid prejudicing any criminal
proceedings.
   Those objections were dropped Thursday.
   In a statement, the public prosecution and serious fraud offices
said their directors were ``now satisfied that all lines of inquiry
have been pursued and that the evidence available is insufficient
to afford a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal
offense relating to any matter of substance raised in the report.''
   House of Fraser issued a statement saying it was heartened that
the episode was behind it and that it could now concentrate of
developing the business. ``It is doubtful that any takeover here or
abroad has been subjected to such exhaustive scrutiny,'' it said.
   Al-Fayed thanked his friends, colleagues and customers ``who
have been so kind and constantly supportive during an unsettling
past five years.''

<TEXT>
   Varian Associates Inc. has named an
outsider, J. Tracy O'Rourke of Rockwell International Corp., as
chairman and chief executive officer to try to turn around the
electronics company's flagging fortunes.
   O'Rourke, 54, who succeeds Thomas D. Sege, was one of three
executive vice presidents and chief operating officers at Rockwell.
   Sege, Varian's chief executive since 1981, was appointed
Wednesday as vice chairman of the board. Varian's board began a
search last summer for a replacement for Sege, 63, who said he
wanted to step out of the CEO's role prior to reaching 65.
   While many industry analysts were unfamiliar with O'Rourke, they
said his track record created hope that the company could begin to
improve its financial performance.
   ``The bottom line is the guy's a heavyweight, very heavyweight,
and I can't be more positive on what this means for Varian going
forward,'' said Stephen J. Balong, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Varian has about 12,000 employees and had 1989 sales of $1.3
billion. It produces systems and components for communications,
defense, scientific, medical and industrial markets worldwide.

<HEAD>Four in 10 Still Jobless After Manufacturing Recession</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About four in 10 workers laid off at steel
mills and manufacturing centers in the depressed Monongahela Valley
since the early 1980s are still out of work, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday.
   In addition, those who are employed bring home paychecks of 40
to 68 percent less than their former wages.
   The survey, which was drafted by steel industry and labor
groups, covered responses of 3,500 workers who lost their jobs
during the steel industry's recession in the early- and mid-1980s.
   Questionnaires were sent to 16,000 of the estimated 40,000
workers laid off in the last decade.
   ``This is not only wrong for the people who are trying to live,
but this is a waste of resources for the area,'' said Mike Stout,
the study's coordinator and a staff member of the Tri-State
Conference on Steel.
   The survey says 18 percent of respondents once used computers,
11 percent operated heavy equipment containing computers, 22
percent monitored quality-control systems and 38 percent read
blueprints.
   Stout said, ``It's a problem that has been forgotten and covered
up for a long time.''
   Stout once worked at USX Corp.'s Homestead works, where the
workforce was cut by 6,000 in the 1980s.
   Other major cutbacks in the 1980s were 7,800 workers at
Westinghouse's Turtle Creek plant, 3,800 workers at USX's
McKeesport plant and 3,500 at LTV's Pittsburgh works.
   In addition to lower or no wages, the workers reported family
breakups, fewer benefits, poorer working conditions and unsafe
workplaces.
   Workers who responded were listed on the rolls of the United
Steelworkers of America, United Electrical Workers and the
Pennsylvania division of the AFL-CIO.
   One-third who are employed said they work part-time and 57
percent said they were discriminated against because of their ages.
The average age of the respondents was 50.
   ``No one wants a 54-year-old ex-steelworker who belonged to a
union,'' wrote one respondent.
   The survey criticizes politicians for relying on jobs in service
industries to try to pump life back into local industries, Stout
said.

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Dive On Slack Demand, Good Crop Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices fell sharply Thursday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting sluggish export demand and
improved growing conditions for the hard red winter wheat crop.
   Corn futures also closed lower while soybeans ended mostly
higher.
   Wheat futures had risen strongly last week and early this week
amid expectations that a small number of delivery notices would be
posted Wednesday, the first day for players to announce their
intentions to deliver grain against the March wheat contract.
   No March wheat delivery notices were posted Wednesday,
validating market expectations, and on Thursday traders focused on
the market's bearish supply-and-demand factors.
   ``Export business remains very lackluster and the hard red
winter wheat has benefited from improved soil moisture,'' said Joel
Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc., a brokers'
advisory service in Chicago.
   A National Weather Service six-to-10-day outlook issued
Wednesday predicted above-average rain for winter-wheat areas,
which prompted further selling, Karlin said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 4\ cents to 5\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.89 a bushel; corn futures
were \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.46\ a bushel; oats
were unchanged to 1{ cents higher with March at $1.43{ a bushel;
soybeans were { cent lower to 3 cents higher with March at $5.67\ a

   An attorney for Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc. said Thursday that the company is not siphoning money from its
brokerage subsidiary, which is liquidating billions of dollars in
securities and other assets.
   Creditors of the collapsed Wall Street firm raised concerns that
money available to satisfy what they said were about $500 million
in claims against the brokerage subsidiary was being reduced.
   The brokerage firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is not subject
to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of its parent. Drexel has
liquidated more than 86 percent of some $47 billion in securities
holdings as well as other assets since the bankruptcy filing Feb.
13.
   Also, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in court
papers that it is Drexel's largest creditor and asked to be placed
on the main committee negotiating in bankruptcy court.
   But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III delayed a
hearing on the motion, which claims that Drexel owes the SEC $150
million for a fund to compensate investors allegedly defrauded by
Drexel securities law violations.
   Barry J. Dichter, an attorney for creditor Banco de Portugal,
said about $500 million in creditors' claims exist at the
subsidiary level. He said he was concerned that money being
generated by Drexel's liquidation would be transferred to the
parent and made subject to claims in the bankruptcy case.
   ``That cash that's being generated ... is creditors' cash, not
the parent's cash,'' Dichter said.
   In the days leading up to the bankruptcy filing, the parent
company took about $300 million from the subsidiary to meet
short-term debt payments after it was unable to borrow money in the
credit markets. It filed for bankruptcy after defaulting on some
debt and failing to obtain bank loans.
   Drexel attorney Alan Miller said in court that Drexel's
subsidiaries were liquidating ``at arm's length'' from the parent
and were not sending money raised by asset sales into the parent.
   Also Thursday, Buschman postponed a hearing on a motion by First
City Bancorp. of Texas seeking a court-appointed examiner to
oversee Drexel's books and one by Drexel asking that three board
members monitor the liquidation. The parties agreed to the delay to
negotiate.
   The judge held a closed hearing with attorneys for the SEC,
California Public Employees' Retirement System and creditors
committee to try to resolve the motions seeking spots on the panel.
   Reporters for The Associated Press, The New York Times and the
Los Angeles Times objected to the closed-door session, which the
judge said constituted a settlement conference and therefore was
permissible.
   Drexel has paid the SEC $200 million for a $350 million fund to
compensate investors. Final installments are due in September and
in September 1992.
   The fund is part of a deal in which Drexel last year pleaded
guilty to six felonies and began paying $650 million in penalties
to resolve charges stemming from a government insider trading
investigation. Both the parent and subsidiary signed the agreement.

   Prices advanced on Wall Street today as the
stock market shrugged off dim prospects for a decline in interest
rates.
   The government reported that personal income, boosted in part by
a federal employee pay raise, rose 0.8 percent in January while
consumer spending increased 0.6 percent.
   Meanwhile, a survey of the nation's purchasing executives
indicated that the manufacturing economy declined in February for
the 10th consecutive month, but at the lowest rate since last June.
   Financial markets believed the reports, which did not indicate a
weakening of the economy, would not prompt the Federal Reserve to
nudge interest rates lower.
   The bond market responded negatively, with the Treasury's
bellwether 30-year bond off about $6.87 for each $1,000 in face
value by late afternoon. Wall Street initially took its cue from
the reaction among bond traders, but then began to move ahead on
its own.
   Analysts said the market's upward momentum, which has propelled
the Dow Jones average 71 points higher this week, enabled investors
to ignore the economic news.
   The market also shrugged off another sharp loss on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 762.41
points, or 2.20 percent, today, closing at 33,829.58, but there was
no perceivable impact in New York.

<TEXT>
   Walter Hasselbring's secrets for
achieving the nation's highest corn yield are a lot of bull.
   The national corn king credits his top-notch crop to generous
applications of the real thing from his cattle and his buffalo
herd, Illinois' largest.
   But he teases unsuspecting visitors with another success secret,
telling them he grew 296 bushels per acre last year by serenading
his corn.
   ``I tell them plants respond to music, so at crucial times I
stroll through my cornfields singing to the plants and you can
almost see them grow,'' chuckled Hasselbring, who has grown the
nation's best-yielding corn crop seven times in the last 15 years.
   The National Corn Growers Association sponsors the contest, and
2,057 farmers entered during the 1989 growing season. There were
seven divisions, depending on the type of tillage, the area of the
country and whether irrigation was used.
   ``Farmers compete not only to see who can grow the most corn but
also to come up with new management ideas that could make all
farmers more efficient,'' said John Campen of the St. Louis-based
association.
   Hasselbring's yield was the highest in the 1989 contest, said
Campen, and established a U.S. record, topping his 1975 mark of
nearly 289 bushels per acre.
   His winning yield was more than twice the 138-bushel-per-acre
average in Iroquois County, where Hasselbring farms 1,800 acres in
east-central Illinois with his two sons.
   ``You can do everything else right, but if you don't get the
rain, you won't win,'' Hasselbring said in an interview Wednesday.
   A high level of fertility also is crucial. Hasselbring uses
about 300 pounds of nitrogen per acre _ roughly twice his normal
rate. He adds manure from his cattle herd and his 105 buffalo.
   Farmers pay $50 to enter the competition. They plant a contest
plot of at least 25 acres. Hasselbring's corn went in May 5, and
the growing season was ideal.
   As the crop matured, Hasselbring walked his contest field.
   ``I could tell things were looking up,'' he said. ``After all
these years farming, you just get an inkling of what's going on.
But, when it was harvested, it was even more than we expected.''
   Judges approved by the National Corn Growers Association
supervise the harvest of at least 1.25 acres from each contest
plot. Hasselbring's was combined Nov. 13-14. Rules require farmers
to harvest at random intervals so they cannot pick the best area of
the field.
   University of Illinois agronomists Fred Welch and Bob Hoeft
agree with Hasselbring that shooting for 300-bushel yields on a
large acreage is a big gamble given high growing costs and the
inability to control weather.
   ``Winning might not mean getting the best dollar-return for your
inputs, and it is profit, not a record yield, that is really
important for commercial farmers,'' Welch said.
   Although the national corn surplus is approaching 2 billion
bushels, the idea that more corn means less profits isn't what
would keep farmers from adopting high-yield techniques, Campen
said. It is the expense of producing such yields.
   ``The economics, at least today, on a broad scale basis wouldn't
warrant it,'' he said.
   Officials at Fred Gutwein &amp; Sons Inc., a family-owned corn and
soybean seed company based in Francesville, Ind., that provided
hybrids to Hasselbring, said his success improved Gutwein name
recognition and sales.
   ``Our hybrid met the challenge,'' said sales manager Eric
Gutwein. ``But, it takes a very special individual like `Duke'
Hasselbring to achieve the pinnacle seven times.''

   Assets of the nation's 499 money market mutual
funds fell $1.90 billion in the latest week to $388.79 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline for the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$3.59 billion rise the previous week to an all time high of $390.69
billion. The Washington-based mutual fund trade group originally
had reported the rise as $3.57 billion to a record $390.68 billion
but revised the figures this week.
   The institute said the subsequent drop reflected an investor
shift out of money market funds into stocks and bonds, which showed
surprising strength relative to other investments.
   It said for the latest week, assets of 245 general purpose funds
fell $151.5 million to $132.4 billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer
funds fell $598.6 million to $164.86 billion, and assets of 153
institutional funds fell $1.15 billion to $91.54 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds in the
week ended Tuesday remained unchanged from the previous week at
7.65 percent, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.65 percent from 7.67 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, unchanged, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.27 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.28 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged at 5.07 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.87
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.94 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.93
percent; 7.96 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.95 percent; and 8
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 7.99 percent.

   Thorn EMI, which has been
expanding its music operations beyond its Capitol Records label,
has offered to buy or distribute Geffen Records, the home of Cher,
Guns N' Roses, Whitesnake and Aerosmith.
   Geffen, one of the last big independent U.S. labels, has had a
close relationship with Time Warner Inc.'s music division, which
manufactures and distributes its records in return for a 50 percent
share of profits.
   Geffen Records' 10-year deal with Warner expires at the end of
the year, but Geffen owner David Geffen said he hopes to reach a
decision on the fate of his company well before then.
   Geffen previously denied seeking a buyer for his West
Hollywood-based label, which is said to be worth as much as $750
million.
   He said he is still talking with Time Warner and that Thorn had
``made me an offer,'' although he added, ``that's hardly a deal.''
   Sharon Christians, director of corporate affairs for Thorn EMI
in London, would not say if an agreement was near but acknowledged
that talks had occurred.
   Thorn EMI has been expanding its music portfolio recently,
responding to consolidation in the music industry and a booming
international market for entertainment.
   It purchased a 50 percent stake in Chrysalis records last year,
and Thorn EMI officials have said they are close to making a deal
to buy a 50 percent stake in Hungary's state recording company,
Hungaroton, for $15 million.
   The conglomerate's pretax profit for the six months ending Sept.
30 was $171 million, up 12 percent from the previous period.

<TEXT>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority said
Thursday it will cut about 1,400 jobs from its nuclear power plants
by Oct. 1.
   TVA nuclear chief Oliver Kingsley Jr. said the reductions, which
will include layoffs, will lower TVA's nuclear force to 6,100
salaried workers. The cuts are the second phase of a job reduction
plan announced last April.
   TVA had projected it would have 6,800 employees at its six
nuclear plants on Oct. 1.
   Kingsley said the cuts reflected TVA's progress in recovering
from safety and management problems that forced it to shut down its
nuclear program from August 1985 until May 1988.
   He said the cuts would ``move TVA a step closer to making its
nuclear power staffing levels comparable to industry averages by
1992.''
   TVA also plans to reduce its nuclear contractors by more than 75
percent this year, from a current level of about 2,700 hourly
workers.
   TVA had 14,380 annual and hourly nuclear employees when it
restarted Sequoyah Nuclear Plant in early 1988 after a 33-month
outage and continued repairs on two other plants.
   More than 4,000 jobs were eliminated over the next year, and in
April 1989 TVA announced plans to cut its total nuclear staff to
9,363 employees by Oct. 1 of that year and to 7,508 _ including
6,800 salaried workers _ by Oct. 1, 1990.

<HEAD>Gasoline Glut Prompts Plunge in Oil Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A virtual glut of gasoline prompted heavy selling of petroleum
futures Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   On other commodity markets, coffee futures surged to new
7{-month highs; precious metals advanced; grain and soybean futures
were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   On the New York Merc, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures
settled 28 cents to 37 cents lower with the contract for delivery
in April at $21.17 a barrel; wholesale home heating oil was 1.13
cents to 1.93 cents lower with April at 54.63 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .80 cent to 2.43 cents lower with April at
55.81 cents a gallon.
   The April gasoline contract led the way down, trading as low as
54.70 cents a gallon amid reports of burdensome gasoline supplies.
   ``We've got so much of it, as a matter of fact, that on the East
Coast they're having some difficulty finding available storage for
all this stuff,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, energy analyst with
PaineWebber Inc.
   He said demand for gasoline was off about 5 percent from a year
ago, possibly reflecting weakness in the economy.
   The price slide runs contrary to the normal seasonal pattern of
rising prices for petroleum products at this time of year as some
oil refiners shut down to retool for greater gasoline production
after concentrating on making heating oil for the winter months.
   Peter Beutel, head of the energy trading group at Elders Futures
Inc., said the so-called turnaround season is already underway but
the markets aren't responding as they usually do.
   ``It just seems at this point, there is too great a supply and
not enough demand,'' he said.
   Coffee futures rose sharply for the second straight day on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, reaffirming a strong upward
trend linked to tight near-term supplies and constructive chart
signals.
   Some support stemmed from reports that Mexican roasters may need
to import up to 400,000 132-pound bags of coffee to meet a domestic
shortfall caused by a Christmastime freeze.
   Analyst Celeste Georkakis of Cargill Investor Services Inc. said
the market was unlikely to encounter much resistance until the May
contract approaches $1 a pound, a price last recorded for that
contract on July 6.
   Coffee futures settled 1.02 cents to 3.94 cents higher with
March at 96.75 cents a pound, the highest settlement of a
near-month coffee future since July 5.
   Gold and silver futures rose modestly on New York's Commodity
Exchange. Silver's rally, the second in as many days, erased the
rest of the losses posted Wednesday.
   Gold futures settled unchanged to 10 cents higher with April at
$409 a troy ounce; silver was 2.5 cents to 3.1 cents higher with
March at $5.154 a troy ounce.
   Wheat futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting slack export demand and improved growing conditions for
the hard red winter wheat crop. Corn futures also closed lower
while soybeans ended mostly higher.
   Wheat settled 4 cents to 5 cents lower with March at $3.89\ a
bushel; corn was \ cent to } cent lower with March at $2.46\ a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 2\ cents higher with March at $1.43{
a bushel; soybeans were { cent lower to 3 cents higher with March
at $5.67\ a bushel.
   Frozen pork-belly futures fell steeply and hog futures also
retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid concerns over
heavy hog slaughter levels and weaker-than-expected cash markets.
   Cattle futures advanced for the third day in a row on
expectations for stronger cash markets.
   Live cattle futures finished .07 cent to .47 cent higher with
April at 75.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .22
cent higher with March at 80.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent to .40 cent lower with April at 49.95 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.23 cents lower with March at 50.12
cents a pound.

   The dollar continued its climb against most
major foreign currencies Thursday, boosted by reports showing
strength in the U.S. economy and by economic uncertainty in Japan.
   Gold prices were slightly higher. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid for gold at $406.70 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EST, up 5 cents from late Wednesday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said the
nation's economy declined in February for the 10th consecutive
month, but at the lowest rate since last June.
   In other economic reports, the Commerce Department said personal
income rose 0.8 percent in January, consumer spending increased 0.6
percent and construction spending rose 1.8 percent for the month.
The construction figure was the biggest increase in more than a
year.
   Craig Sloane, a currency futures analyst with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., said the reports ``seemed to paint the picture
that the economy is doing all right.''
   Traders said the Federal Reserve sold dollars in an attempt to
halt the currency's rise against the yen, but the intervention
appeared to have limited impact.
   The yen was weakened by the slump in the Tokyo stock market,
said Chris Mendell, a vice president at Security Pacific Bank in
Los Angeles. The market's key Nikkei index fell 762.41 points, or
2.20 percent, closing at 33,829.58.
   Sloane said the dollar flirted with the 150-yen level, but never
reached it.
   The West German mark continued to be hurt by concern that a plan
for exchanging East German marks for their West German counterpart
would cause inflation, Ms. Mendell said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 149.78 yen from 148.52 yen
Wednesday. Later, in London, the dollar traded lower at 149.67 yen.
But in New York, the dollar rose to 149.85 from 149.08 late
Wednesday.
   The dollar has not closed that high against the yen in New York
since June 15, when it reached 151.30 yen.
   The dollar also rose against the British pound. In London, one
British pound cost $1.6655 late Thursday, cheaper for buyers than
Wednesday's $1.6895. In New York, the pound closed at $1.6640, down
from $1.6752 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.7194 West German marks, up from 1.7074;
1.5095 Swiss francs, up from 1.5010; 5.8070 French francs, up from
5.7695; 1,267.25 Italian lire, up from 1,260.75; and 1.1910
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1927.
   Late rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's prices,
included: 1.7145 West German marks, up from 1.6955; 1.5060 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4900; 5.7935 French francs, up from 5.7300;
1.9307 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9070; 1,266.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,250.00; and 1.1899 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2072.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose
10 cents a troy ounce to $406.20.
   Earlier, gold closed in London at a bid price of $407.75 a troy
ounce, down from $407.90. In Zurich, it also closed at a bid
$407.75, down from $407.79. In Hong Kong, gold closed at $405.85
bid, down from $409.25.
   Silver traded late in London at $5.16 bid a troy ounce, up from
$5.10. In New York, silver for current delivery rose to $5.154 an
ounce from $5.127 late Wednesday on the Commodity Exchange.

   Prices closed higher on Wall Street Thursday as
the stock market found a silver lining in a downbeat report on the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.34 to 2,635.59.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
843 up, 633 down and 493 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a moderate 157.93
million shares, down from 184.41 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 185.31 million shares.
   The monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing
Management indicated that the manufacturing economy declined in
February for the 10th consecutive month, but at the lowest rate
since last June.
   The financial markets at first believed the report was unlikely
to prompt the Federal Reserve to nudge interest rates lower.
   The bond market responded negatively, with the Treasury's
bellwether 30-year bond off about $6.87 for each $1,000 in face
value by late afternoon. Wall Street initially took its cue from
the reaction among bond traders, but then began to move ahead on
its own.
   Analysts said Wall Street has begun to accept the fact that
interest rates aren't going to come down anytime soon, in part
because U.S. rates must stay high to remain competitive with yields
in West Germany, Japan and other countries. The market also
realizes that higher rates are necessary to control inflation, the
analysts said.
   Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc.,
said the market, instead of focusing on interest rates, was more
concerned about the possibility of recession. Traders interpreted
the purchasing managers report as a signal that the economy,
although slowing, won't tip into a recession, he said.
   But traders lack conviction in the strength of the stock market,
Barbanel said, noting that as the market reached its high _ with
the Dow Jones average crossing 2,655 _ investors began to take
profits.
   The market shrugged off another sharp loss on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 762.41 points, or
2.20 percent, Thursday, closing at 33,829.58, but there was no
perceivable impact in New York.
   The most active issue on the NYSE was Union Carbide, which fell
2 to 22\ after the chemical company decided against a restructuring.
   USAir Group fell 1 to 31. A published report said investor
Marvin Davis had acquired 5 percent of the airline's stock.
   Among blue chip stocks, Philip Morris fell 1 to 36, AT&amp;T was up
&lsqb; to 39~ and Exxon slipped { to 46{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $9.770 billion, or 0.31
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.45 to 183.52.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.00 to 383.02, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index advanced 0.85 to 332.74.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
picked up 1.38 to close at 427.21. At the American Stock Exchange,
the market value index closed at 354.04, up 1.14.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three main measures of the nation's money
supply each rose in the week ended Feb. 19, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
$1.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted $800.6 billion from a revised
$798.9 billion in the previous week.
   The central bank said the measure known as M2 rose $4.1 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $3,256.7 billion from $3,252.6 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $3 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $4,072.2 billion from $4,069.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 6.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.9 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,230.5 billion, a 6.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,050.6 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1
rose 5.0 percent to an average of $795.3 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $136 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$1.659 billion the previous week. The decline refloected the bank's
reclassification of about $1.5 billion of Fed borrowings to the
extended credit category.
   _The Federal Reserve said net borrowed reserves averaged $364
million in the two weeks ended Feb. 21, compared with net free
reserves of $388 million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $300.6 billion in the two-week period ended
Feb. 21, up from $298.5 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>K mart Profits Going To Fight Expansions By Wal-Mart, Others</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With Wal-Mart Stores Inc. gaining like an
Arkansas rabbit on K mart Corp.'s position as the nation's
second-largest retailer, K mart has decided it's time for a
makeover.
   K mart has been revamping old stores, opening new ones and
trying to update its ``blue light special'' image under a
five-year, $2.3 billion chainwide makeover aimed at fending off
expanding competitors.
   Faced with newer stores by such expanding chains as Wal-Mart,
from Bentonville, Ark., and Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp.'s
Target discount chain, K mart has been trying to rouse customers
with a brighter, higher-intensity atmosphere, expanded product
offerings and new services.
   The stores are moving their usual popcorn and tobacco counters
away from front-and-center, shedding dull linoleum and cluttered
aisles and offering such new products as fax machines to attract
customers.
   ``Retail is energy: their saliva glands are going, their credit
cards are hot,'' said Michael Crosson, an outside designer hired to
help shape the chain's future.
   This isn't goodbye to blue-collar customers who have flocked to
decades of K mart ``blue light specials'' and ``midnight madness''
sales. Those will continue, K mart spokesman Orren F. Knauer said.
   But in a departure from its past, K mart has been stocking more
brand-name merchandise to appeal to customers, and those household
names will be better displayed in the new stores, Chairman Joseph
E. Antonini said this week.
   Events of the past week showed the task K mart faces in trying
to perk itself up.
   Antonini said on Monday that K mart would take a $640 million
charge against its 1989 earnings to pay for speeding up its
five-year, $2.3 billion chainwide makeover.
   As a result, K mart is expected to report only minimal or flat
earnings next week. It reported 1988 profits of $802.9 million on
sales of $27.3 billion.
   Meanwhile, smaller but faster-growing 1,400-store Wal-Mart
announced record sales and profits for 1989, with earnings up 28.5
percent to $1.1 billion on sales of $25 billion. Wal-Mart on
Thursday reported its sales February sales were up 33 percent,
while at its stores open a year or longer sales were up 17 percent.
   ``It's not if, it's when Wal-Mart will pass them by at their
present growth rates,'' said Frederick Marx, an independent
retailing consultant based in Bloomfield Hills.
   But Marx predicted a shifting lead, with K mart never far
behind. Wal-Mart, though growing fast in small-town America, won't
be able match K mart's immense array of store sites in metropolitan
areas, he said.
   Fighting back will mean changes at almost all of K mart's more
than 2,300 discount stores, Antonini said. He announced plans to
build 250 new stores, enlarge 620, relocate 280, close 30 and
refurbish about 1,260 in the five-year program.
   Prototypes already are operating in the Detroit suburbs of Royal
Oak and Rochester, Mich., and Virginia Beach, Va.
   Both new and old stores have adopted folksy Wal-Mart style
``people-greeters.'' At K-mart's old-style store in Port Huron, on
Lake Huron 60 miles north of Detroit, a greeter with a rag grinned
recently as he wiped melted snow from carts just in from the
parking lot and pushed them toward incoming shoppers.
   In the new store, instead of a whiff of the popcorn, candy and
tobacco counter of old, shoppers are greeted by gleaming floors,
bright lights and wide-open spaces.
   The popcorn counter was moved to a cafeteria area right of the
entrance. Rest rooms are easy to find, stylish graphics mark the
cosmetics area, videos play among the sporting goods and the stores
have bold signs and bigger stocks of merchandise on the shelves.
   ``Look at the jewelry area,'' Knauer said. ``It's the same
product we sell in the other stores, but the fixturing is more
department-store like. It makes the product look better.''
   Crosson, executive vice president of Jon Greenberg and
Associates Inc. in Berkley, said such perceptions amounted to
reality, in retailing.
   ``It's no longer just a bigger dime store, it's a discount
department store,'' he said of K mart.
   Crosson's firm has designed stores for retail establishments
including Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, and chains owned by New York-based
Mercantile Stores, which include Cincinnati's McAlpin's, Denver's
Joslin's and Florida's Gayfer's department stores.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan Report Progress in Supercomputer Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese negotiators moved closer Thursday
to an agreement on Japanese government purchases of supercomputers,
an area in which the United States contends Japan discriminates
unfairly against foreign sellers, officials said.
   Under U.S. trade law, trade officials must report to Congress by
the end of April on the progress of negotiations aimed at removing
unfair barriers imposed by trading partners. Japan has been cited
for alleged restrictions on satellites, forestry products and
supercomputers.
   ``The talks have reached an interesting phase in that we are
talking about the actual terms of a new arrangement'' for
procedures to be used by the Japanese government in buying
supercomputers, said a U.S. official who participated in the
negotiations.
   The official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity,
said an August 1987 agreement had failed to result in any purchases
of U.S. supercomputers by the Japanese government.
   ``The purpose ... is to achieve open, competitive procurement
procedures, but we don't think we've achieved that yet. We hope by
a new agreement to arrive at a situation in which the market
opportunities for U.S. companies truly increase,'' he said.
   Supercomputers are extremely expensive, complex machines used
for weather forecasting, defense systems and other applications
where a huge number of calculations must be performed quickly.
   The talks followed negotiations late last month on forestry
products and satellites and on economic structures in the two
nations that have prevented a reduction in Japan's trade surplus
with the United States, which last year totaled $49 billion. All
three rounds of talks failed to achieve significant results,
officials said, adding to trade tension between the two nations.
   Under the ``Super 301'' clause of the U.S. trade law, the United
States can impose penalty tariffs of up to 100 percent on countries
that fail to remove their trade barriers in negotiations after they
are cited for unfair practices.
   ``I think there is an intention on both sides to reach an
agreement'' on supercomputers, said the U.S. official.
   Foreign Ministry officials said U.S. negotiators called on
Japanese agencies to consider the actual performance of
supercomputers when evaluating competing bids, rather than the
``catalog,'' or theoretical performance, and to give priority to
computers that surpass, rather than merely meet, bidding standards.
   In the past, the U.S. official said, Cray Research Inc., the
only major U.S. manufacturer of supercomputers, has lost bids
because it offered higher performance at a higher price than
Japanese competitors.
   U.S. officials in the past also have criticized ``academic
discounts'' offered by Japanese computer makers to universities and
government agencies.
   In this week's talks, Japanese negotiators said they were aware
that such practices were unfair and pledged to enforce the
country's Anti-Monopoly Law, the U.S. official said.
   Japan has refused to negotiate trade disputes under the threat
of punitive tariffs, and Noboru Hatakeyama, director general of the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Trade Policy Bureau,
denied that the talks fell under the U.S. trade law.
   ``We are receiving requests for improvement of our system for
purchasing supercomputers,'' he said.
   ``We have asked companies to raise prices to a moderate level
and increased our per-unit budget for supercomputers in the fiscal
1990 draft budget,'' he added. ``We have decided to raise the
budget so American firms can sell their computers without excessive
discounts.''
   Japanese negotiators pledged to fully open up government
procurement of supercomputers, but called on the United States to
do the same, the U.S. official said. The U.S. government has not
bought any foreign supercomputers, although some Japanese machines
now are competitive with U.S. designs in speed.
   ``My position in response has been that as world leaders, they
should not hesitate to do better than we do in the United States,''
he said.

<HEAD>Pan Am Says Creditors Agree To Defer $100 Million in Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially strapped Pan Am Corp. said Thursday
it had reached agreement with two creditors to defer about $106
million in payments.
   The airline company did not identify the creditors beyond saying
they are aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
   About $62.5 million of the payments were deferred earlier, and
were the subject of a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the company said. The deferral of those payments
expired Wednesday, spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
   Pan Am said the first scheduled repayments are due in this
year's fourth quarter and will extend through the fourth quarter of
1991, subject to certain mandatory prepayments under certain,
undisclosed circumstances.
   The company also agreed to pledge additional assets, including
spare parts, as collateral, it said.
   In addition, Pan Am said it reached agreement with a third
creditor that allowed the company to refinance three Boeing 747s
through sale-leaseback agreements. The proceeds to Pan Am from
those agreements, completed Thursday, was $65 million.
   Pan Am has been rumored to be seeking a merger partner for
several months to ease its cash-flow problems. The New York-based
company has lost nearly $2 billion since 1981 and is saddled with
about $840 million in debt.

<HEAD>More Mixed Signals Suggest Economy Stuck in Neutral</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A variety of statistical reports released Thursday by the
government and private business provided more evidence of a
sluggish, but not totally out-of-sorts economy.
   One private report showed a continuing decline in the
manufacturing economy in February, but many of the nation's
retailers reported modest improvement in their fortunes during the
month.
   The government, meanwhile, reported a mix of pluses and minuses.
Construction spending and personal income were up in January, but
so were home prices and mortgage rates.
   The reaction to the mixed signals was generally positive on Wall
Street, where stock prices closed higher on the belief that the
economy had not weakened enough yet to prompt a decline in interest
rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.34 to
2,635.59.
   Below are some of the highlights from the various economic and
business reports:
   _The National Association of Purchasing Management said the U.S.
manufacturing economy slowed for the 10th consecutive month in
February, although the rate of decline was at the lowest since last
June.
   The survey of purchasing executives at over 300 industrial
companies showed some signs of strength in new orders and
production, but the overall index remained weak. The index rose to
48.3 percent from 45.2 percent in January, but a reading below 50
indicates the economy generally is declining.
   _Major chain stores reported some growth in February sales, but
the outlook for the retailing industry remained grim. Industry
analysts gave warm weather the credit for boosting sales in what is
normally a slow month for stores.
   One standout among the retailers was discounter Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., which said its February sales surged 33 percent, while sales
at stores open a year or longer were up 17 percent. In contrast,
Sears, Roebuck and Co., the country's biggest retailer, reported
sales were flat.
   _The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 1.8
percent in January, the biggest increase in more than a year.
Economists credited the warmest January since the government began
keeping track of temperatures 96 years ago.
   Residential, non-residential and government construction
spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $424 billion
in January on the largest gain since a 2.3 percent advance in
December 1988.
   _Housing affordability declined in January, according to the
National Association of Realtors, whose monthly survey showed
evidence of higher prices and mortgage rates. The Realtors'
affordability index fell to 104.2, meaning that a family earning
the national median income of $33,708 had 104.2 percent of the
income needed to qualify for a median priced home costing $96,200.
   The index was down from 108.2 in December, the highest level
since it measured 110.5 in January 1989.
   _Personal income rose 0.8 percent in January despite a new tax
bite from Social Security. The report by the Commerce Department
also showed consumer spending climbed a narrower 0.6 percent, a
pace which analysts attributed to caution in the face of inflation.
   The Commerce Department said personal income ran at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $4.60 trillion last month, after gaining
0.5 percent in December.
   Analysts cited the 1.1 percent increase in consumer prices in
January for the slowdown in consumer spending, from a 1 percent
gain in December.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nautilus Sports-Medical Industries Inc., which
makes the popular Nautilus exercise equipment, has filed for
bankruptcy court protection from creditors.
   In documents filed in federal bankruptcy court in Roanoke, Va.,
the Dallas-based company listed $38.6 million in liabilities and
$27.3 million in assets.
   The company was moved to Dallas in 1987, about a year after it
was purchased by Ward International Corp., a diversified firm owned
by Dallas investor Travis Ward.
   Company attorney Ed Creel said Nautilus has received new
financing from its current lenders, who will continue funding the
company during its attempt to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   He said Nautilus had spoken to several prospective buyers.
   Most of Nautilus' 250 employees work in the company's
manufacturing plant in Independence, Va., Creel said. He said he
did not think the bankruptcy court filing Tuesday would prompt
layoffs.
   ``It is unlikely that our customers will notice any changes in
our operation,'' John Urmston, Nautilus' chief operating officer,
said in a statement.
   Creel said the company faces extensive litigation, but declined
to comment further on what factors drove Nautilus to seek
reorganization.

<HEAD>Union Sues Nordstrom Over Wages, Decertification Campaign
Announced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 employees rallied Thursday in support
of Nordstrom Inc., the fashion retailer whose sterling service
reputation has been sullied by accusations of systematic wage law
violations, and opened a campaign to decertify their union.
   Accusing the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers of threatening
their livelihoods, dozens of workers carried signs saying ``Nobody
Asked Me _ I Support Nordstrom'' and chanted, ``One, two, three,
four. No more union any more,'' and ``We love Nordstrom.''
   Organizers of the rally also solicited funds to help pay for a
full-page advertisement to appear Friday in The Seattle Times.
   ``The truth is that Nordstrom treats us fairer than the union
does,'' Joe Dover, a shoe sales clerk with 11 years of experience
in Bellevue, said at the rally.
   ``It's time to let the consumers hear both sides of the story,''
Dover said. ``I say the consumers support Nordstrom because
Nordstrom has been good to them for so many years.''
   The rally added to the controversy over pay practices, labor
relations and declining profits at Nordstrom, which employs about
30,000 workers at 60 stores in six states.
   Nordstrom built a near-legendary reputation for customer service
from polite and attentive sales clerks. However, in response to
complaints brought by the sales clerks' union, the Washington
Department of Labor and Industries ruled Feb. 15 Nordstrom had
engaged in a pattern of requiring employees to perform
uncompensated work.
   Tasks at issue included having workers attend meetings, deliver
merchandise, check inventory, write thank-you notes and perform
other chores without pay outside normal working hours.
   The state agency ruled Nordstrom must pay two years' worth of
back wages for such tasks, and the company set aside a $15 million
reserve to cover claims from Washington state workers.
   The union has claimed the provision was inadequate and on Monday
filed a class action suit on behalf of 50,000 present and former
company workers in Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, Utah
and Alaska, claiming wage and hour violations.
   UFCW contracts covering about 1,500 clerks in the Seattle-Tacoma
area, Nordstrom's only unionized sales personnel, expired Aug. 1.
   Last week, ruling on a complaint by the union, the National
Labor Relations Board accused Nordstrom of bypassing the union and
bargaining directly with employees over whether they are owed back
wages. Union complaints on other issues remain under review, said
Larry McCargar, assistant to the agency's regional director.
   Local 1001 president Joe Peterson said the company ``has
conducted an illegal campaign to get rid of the union. We're going
to keep on with our campaign to get a fair contract.''
   But Jack McMillan, Nordstrom's president, said Thursday's rally
represented a backlash against the union.
   ``They've pulled out everything they can think of. The press
coverage has been, we think, unfair to us in the extreme. Now the
employees and the customers are coming to our defense,'' he said.
   Dozens at the rally cheered as Marv Treadwell, who works in the
men's suits department in Tacoma, said petitions calling for an
election on whether to retain representation by Local 367 had been
signed by 40 percent of the workers eligible to vote at his store.
   Greg Helean, a women's shoe sales clerk in Bellevue, said
similar petitions were being circulated in the Seattle area.

<HEAD>Turner Broadcasting Reports $111 Million Fourth-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. on Thursday
reported a fourth-quarter loss of $111 million because of a
refinancing last October to retire long-term debt.
   The media conglomerate reported improvement in all divisions _
entertainment, news, professional sports, syndication and real
estate _ for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1989.
   The company attributed the loss to a refinancing of
substantially all its long-term debt and redemption of outstanding
shares of its Cable News Network Inc. subsidiary.
   Turner borrowed $900 million under a bank credit agreement and
issued new debt at lower interest rates. A $123 million charge for
the quarter came from payments associated with retiring old debt.
   The quarterly loss compared with an $18.1 million loss in the
same 1988 quarter. Revenue was $292.8 million, up from $224.3
million in the same period a year ago.
   For the full year, Turner reported a net loss of $70.6 million,
compared with a loss of $94.5 million in 1988. Revenue was $1.06
billion, up from $804 million a year earlier.
   ``Absent the one-time charge resulting from the refinancing, we
would have had our first net profit since 1985,'' Turner chairman
and president Ted Turner said in a statement.
   Turner said the news segment, Cable News Network and Headline
News, continued to grow with revenue up 28 percent and operating
profit up 57 percent for the year.
   Syndication and licensing revenue rose 30 percent, due to
increased video sales, new pricing strategies for classic catalogue

   The only segment to report a loss was professional sports, which
lost $3.89 million. Turner is a majority owner of the Atlanta
Braves baseball team and the Atlanta Hawks of the National
Basketball Association.

   Tobacco should be outlawed but probably never
will be, a House subcommittee chairman said Thursday, as lawmakers
studied ways to keep people from becoming cigarette addicts.
   ``I would love to legislate tobacco out of existence and make it
criminal,'' Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, told lawmakers from North
Carolina, a tobacco-growing state.
   Luken is chairman of a House subcommittee studying legislation
aimed at keeping tobacco companies from directing advertising
campaigns toward women, young people and minorities.
   Under questioning from Reps. Stephen L. Neal, D-N.C., and Howard
Coble, R-N.C., Luken said an outright ban on tobacco wouldn't work,
noting the nation's experience with Prohibition in the 1920s and
the current debate over legalizing drugs.
   Opponents of advertising restrictions argue that supporters
really would like to see smoking outlawed.
   ``Advocates of bans really want to ban smoking, not advertising
for smoking,'' said Rep. Alex McMillan, R-N.C. and a member of the
transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee that Luken
chairs.
   Luken's proposed bill would limit print advertising to text only
_ there could be no pictures and no logos. It would also ban
advertising directed at minors and ban billboard advertising except
in sports facilities.
   In addition, it would ban sports events such as the recent
Virginia Slims tennis tournament in Washington, which critics say
link smoking with athletics and inserts brand names into sporting
news copy.
   Finally, the bill would grant states and local governments
broader authority to regulate advertising ``within the limits of
the Constitution.''
   The tobacco industry argues that it is not trying to recruit new
smokers with targeted campaigns. It denies trying to reach youthful
smokers.
   But Luken and other advocates of restrictions say that because
390,000 smokers die each year, the industry must recruit thousands
of new smokers each day.
   Panelist Jim Slattery, D-Kan., said it was clear that tobacco
companies were targeting youths. He argued that the language,
illustrations and basic promotional gimmick of the tobacco campaign
_ free T-shirts and posters _ clearly indicate a campaign aimed at
hooking new smokers.
   He showed a brochure that was mailed to a 14-year-old from
Connecticut offering free cigarettes after the youth responded to a
free ``Camel'' cigarette T-Shirt offer.
   ``How many T-shirts do you write in for?'' Slattery asked his
colleagues.
   ``I contend that when you give away T-shirts you are targeting
children, not targeting adults,'' he said.
   ``You don't hang around the same places I do,'' countered R.J.
Reynolds spokesman Dan Fishel in a telephone interview from
Winston-Salem, N.C.
   Fishel pointed out that it screens out minors who call in
requests for T-shirts, and pointed out that the promotional
material requires a signed affidavit that the person requesting
material is over 21.
   He said he has received only three calls in 15 months from
parents whose children ordered T-shirts. He had no marketing data
on the age breakdown for people responding to the T-shirt campaign.
   But the mother of the 14-year-old said several of her son's
friends had ordered the T-shirts. The woman, who asked to remain
anonymous to protect her son's identity, said he was 13 when he
called for the shirt and his voice had not begun changing.
   She said she was particularly upset because her father had just
died as a result of emphysema acquired after years of smoking.

<HEAD>New Chemical May Replace Alar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Initial tests by a Washington apple grower have
identified an organic chemical that may serve as a substitute for
Alar, which was banned as a probable carcinogen last year after a
national scare.
   But a scientist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
Thursday it was too early to tell if the grower's initial results
will hold up, and that the chemical would require at least two more
years of study.
   Eric Curry of the USDA in Wenatchee said such testing generally
requires three orchards in three locations around the state for
three years.
   Spray-N-Grow, a Houston-based company, said initial results on
an orchard owned by a Yakima-area grower found trees treated with
the chemical produced apples with a significant increase in
uniformity of color, sweetness, firmness and harvest time over
untreated apples.
   Bill Muskopf, president of Spray-N-Grow, said the chemical
``provides the same benefits (as Alar) while remaining completely
organic and totally non-toxic.''
   Alar was a synthetic chemical growers used for two decades
before a private consumer group issued a report last year saying
consumption of apples treated with the chemical increased cancer
risk in children. The Environmental Protection Agency banned the
chemical later in the year.
   Unlike Alar, Spray-N-Grow is an organic chemical, a
micronutrient that has been proven non-toxic in private tests,
company officials said. It has been used by commercial vegetable
growers and home gardeners for several years, the company said.
   The Alar scare pushed prices for organic apples far above those
for chemically treated apples. Organically grown red apples were
selling for $1.29 at a Seattle market Thursday, compared to 39
cents per pound for other red apples.
   Alar's most significant benefit was retaining the internal
firmness of apples during months of cold storage. That will be
tested with the new chemical this year, Spray-N-Grow said.

<HEAD>Lawsuit: Sizzler Restaurants Trying To Oust Major Franchisee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's largest Sizzler restaurant
franchisees said Thursday the Sizzler company is trying to ruin his
business so it can take over his restaurants and control the
Chicago market.
   Anthony Basile, president of FBN Food Services Inc. and Midwest
Restaurant Concepts Inc., is suing Sizzler Restaurants
International Inc. in federal court for $15 million in real damages
and $10 million in punitive damages, alleging fraud and breach of
covenant of good faith.
   Mark Weisberger, general counsel for Los Angeles-based Sizzler,
declined comment on the lawsuit, citing a company policy.
   Basile said his 21 Sizzler steakhouse restaurants in the Chicago
area and three in southwestern Michigan make him the third-largest
Sizzler franchisee in the country.
   He contends that Sizzler's inconsistent advertising policies
contributed to a decline in his stores' sales and a $3.5 million
loss for him and his partners. Basile said Sizzler has offered to
buy back his restaurants for about half their asset value of $15
million.
   ``They just did not want to see us succeed because they wanted
the market back,'' Basile said in a telephone interview. ``They
want to come back into Chicago because Chicago represents an
excellent opportunity for future growth.''
   Basile, who said he worked as a national food-industry
consultant before buying his first eight Sizzler restaurants from
the company in 1987, contended the Chicago market could support 50
to 60 Sizzler stores.
   Franchisers sometimes buy back stores from franchisees so they
can shrink the contractual territory boundaries of those stores and
put more stores into the same market, said Don Boroian, chairman of
Francorp, a franchising consulting firm outside Chicago.
   Basile said the contract he signed in 1987 required him to
contribute money to a local Sizzler advertising cooperative that
was controlled by another, larger Sizzler franchisee. The
cooperative bought advertising for all Sizzler restaurants in the
area.
   Basile said that in 1988, the other franchisee was in financial
trouble and told him to buy its 12 restaurants or it would withhold
advertising dollars.
   Basile said he subsequently learned from the company that the
other franchisee was not required, as Basile was, to contribute to
the advertising fund. So Basile said he agreed to buy out his
competitor _ giving Basile a monopoly in the Chicago market.
   He said he then sought help from Sizzler in reviving the
troubled stores, only to be refused.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. manufacturing economy slowed in
February for the 10th consecutive month, although the decline was
at the lowest rate since last June, according to a survey of the
nation's purchasing managers released Thursday.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said the
figures showed that although certain manufacturing indicators
reflected further strength, the sustained decline pointed to a
continued underlying economic weakness.
   The trade association said its index rose to 48.3 percent in
February from 45.2 percent in January.
   A reading below 50 indicates the U.S. manufacturing economy
generally is declining; above 50, that it generally is expanding.
   The February reading was the highest since June's 48.8 percent,
the group said from its headquarters in Tempe, Ariz.
   The report, which is closely watched on Wall Street, sent bond
prices lower in early trading. Bonds tend to lose value on
indications that the economy is picking up steam, because that
implies the Federal Reserve may not be inclined to ease interest
rates for fear of triggering inflation.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond dropped } point, or $7.50
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when prices
fall, climbed to 8.60 percent from 8.53 percent late Wednesday.
   Prices were moderately higher on the stock market, which
appeared little affected by the report.
   The new-orders portion of the group's survey showed that segment
expanding for the first time since May, while the production
segment registered overall growth for the first time since last
June. In addition, both new-export orders and imports continued to
show increased growth, the group said.
   The employment portion of the survey declined for the 12th
consecutive month, but the rate of decline was the lowest since
June.
   Supplier deliveries were faster for the 10th consecutive month
and at a significantly greater rate than in January, when many
shortages of delivered goods resulted from severe cold weather, the
group said.
   Prices of goods declined for the ninth consecutive month and at
the greatest rate of decline since December 1982.
   ``Although the first increases registered in production and new
orders since mid-1989 are encouraging, the continued improvement in
supplier deliveries and significant decline in prices suggests a
lack of any underlying strength in the economy,'' said Robert J.
Bretz, chairman of the trade group's survey committee and director
of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.
   The report is based on a monthly survey of purchasing executives
at over 300 industrial companies. The figures are adjusted for
seasonal factors.

   Chrysler Corp. announced it will
extend its guaranteed rebate program through March for most its
cars and trucks, except its popular minivans and LeBaron
convertibles.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker guarantees that if the rebate on a
given vehicle is increased before Sept. 30, the buyer will get the
difference. Current rebates range from $500 to $2,500.
   In its announcement Wednesday, the company didn't comment on how
much the rebate extension will cost. In general automakers don't
report such costs.
   Chrysler took a $664-million fourth-quarter loss in 1989 and is
in the middle of a plan to cut $1.5 billion in annual costs by the
end of this year.

<HEAD>Four Senior Editors Resign in Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four of Pantheon Books' six senior editors have
resigned, citing ``the removal'' of Managing Director Andre
Schiffrin as just the most visible step to date in the publishing
house's decline.
   The resignations were the latest to rock the publishing
industry, which has seen several management shakeups and pressure
on profits in recent months.
   Alberto Vitale, chairman and chief executive of Pantheon parent
Random House Inc., announced Schiffrin's resignation on Tuesday.
Schiffrin had joined Pantheon in 1962, shortly after its
acquisition by Random House.
   ``It's clearly a forced resignation and everybody knows it,''
said Tom Engelhardt, one of the four senior editors who resigned
Wednesday. The Washington Post quoted unidentified sources as
saying Schiffrin was forced out after refusing to cut his staff and
the number of books issued.
   Vitale said Schiffrin's resignation ``was not requested.''
Schiffrin did not return messages left at his office.
   In resigning, the four senior editors cited Pantheon's history
as a voice for the otherwise unheard. And in an accompanying
statement, Engelhardt expressed concern that in a publishing world
increasingly dominated by ``a few men ... and a handful of
relatively faceless media conglomerates,'' independent voices are
being drowned out by the bottom line.
   ``Pantheon was founded in 1942 to protect an imperiled
culture,'' said the statement from the four editors. ``We sought to
continue that tradition by bringing into public view the forgotten
and the iconoclastic, the quirky and the profound, the crises faced
by other cultures, and by our own.''
   Founded by German exiles Helen and Kurt Wolff, Pantheon last
year published more than 100 books. Its authors have included
Simone DeBeauvoir, George Kennan, Ralph Nader, Herbert Gans,
Jean-Paul Sartre and Noam Chomsky.
   Engelhardt and fellow departee Wendy Wolf maintain that Random
House is considering significantly cutting the list of books
Pantheon will publish, Wolf says by more than a third.
   Vitale conceded that Pantheon has incurred ``substantial''
losses over at least the last five years, but said there are no
current plans to cut its list.
   ``It may be necessary. I don't know,'' Vitale said. ``We'll have
to ask Fred Jordan after awhile.''
   Jordan was named Tuesday as Pantheon vice president and
publisher, succeeding Schiffrin. Affirming his own commitment to
preserve Pantheon's character, Jordan said management had not
suggested cutting back on publishing plans.
   Vitale stressed that a solution to Pantheon's problems would be
based first on publishing considerations, not financial.
   But at least some authors sided with the departees.
   Studs Terkel, who wrote seven books for Pantheon, said he would
no longer publish with it.
   ``Pantheon has always been a classy publisher, and Andre was a
symbol of that,'' Terkel told The New York Times. ``His firing is a
barbaric act.''
   In a letter to the Times, Terkel and nine other Pantheon authors
said Schiffrin's termination, like the December departure of Robert
L. Bernstein as chairman and president of Random House, resulted
from their being unable ``to meet the demands of the proprietors''
to put ``short-term return upon investment'' above the ``criteria
of cultural vitality and literary excellence.''
   Random House and Pantheon belong to the publishing empire
controlled by Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. and Donald Edward Newhouse.
   Jordan previously was executive vice president and editor in
chief of the Grove Weidenfeld publishing company, which was put up
for sale Tuesday following recent resignations of top editors and
losses estimated at $15 million last year.
   Schiffrin's and the senior editors' resignations are effective
March 15.
   The other senior editors are James Peck and Sara Bershtel.

   The Baby Boom, the massive generation that
overcrowded schools and colleges and flooded the job market, is
becoming the Midlife Boom.
   The number of Americans aged 35 to 44 increased by 9.5 million
between 1980 and 1988, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.
   ``This is an average annual increase of 3.9 percent _ four times
the pace of growth of the total population,'' reported Frederick W.
Hollmann in a study of the population by age, sex and race.
   The leading edge of that group turned 35 in 1981 and was 40 in
1986, heading into middle age. Middle age has no formal census
definition, although some dictionaries list it as the ages 40 to 60.
   The aging boomers boosted the 35-to-44 age group from 25.9
million in 1980 to 35.3 million in 1988, the report said.
   As the huge generation born between 1946 and 1964 has aged, it
has affected many segments of society from baby food makers to
school builders to the makers of blue jeans and business suits.
   Now the impact may fall back to the baby food market, as the
post-World War II children begin having their own delayed families.
   The population under age 5 is rising again and those in
elementary school, after declining for several years, began
increasing again in 1985.
   In their 20s the Baby Boomers created something of a Baby Bust
by postponing marriage and children while pursuing education and
careers, population experts report.
   Now many are catching up in their 30s, a sort of echo of the
Baby Boom, although birth rates are still nowhere near those
recorded after World War II.
   ``The frequency of childbearing among women has increased
slightly since the early part of the decade, primarily in the later
ages of childbearing,'' reported Hollmann.
   At the same time the elderly population is growing rapidly,
centenarians in particular.
   The larger population aged 100 or more results from several
factors including something of a baby boom back in the 1880s, a
substantial immigration from Europe early in this century and
improvements in health care during this century.
   There were 54,000 centenarians in 1988, up from just 14,000 in
1980.
   Hollmann's report summarizes a wide variety of population trends
including:
   _The population aged 14 to 24 declined by 5.6 million between
1980 and 1988 as the last of the Baby Boom turned 25.
   _The nation's black population was 30.3 million in 1989, up from
26.9 million in 1980. Blacks increased by 1.5 percent in 1988,
nearly twice the white growth of 0.8 percent.
   _Hispanics, who can be of any race, grew from 14.8 million in
1980 to 19.9 million in 1988.
   _The fastest growing segment of the population was Asians and
Pacific Islanders, up 70 percent in the 1980s. They increased from
3.8 million in 1980 to 6.5 million in 1988.
   _American Indians increased from 1.4 million to 1.7 million over
the decade.

<HEAD>Open Cases Against Northrop Include Alleged $20 Billion B-2
Overcharge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serious criminal investigations are
continuing against Northrop Corp., including allegations of $20
billion in B-2 bomber overcharges, despite a plea-bargain that
disposed of scores of criminal charges, sources close to the probes
said Thursday.
   Northrop pleaded guilty Tuesday to 34 charges of lying to the
government and agreed to pay a $17 million fine. Northrop admitted
falsifying test data on parts for the cruise missile and Harrier
attack jet.
   In exchange, the government agreed to drop 139 other counts of
making false statements and two counts of conspiracy. The
government also dropped several probes into allegations of improper
testing of MX missile parts and accusations the company
fraudulently bought MX parts outside normal channels.
   But investigations continue into whether Northrop bribed South
Korean officials, bilked the government while auctioning property
seized by the Customs Service, and overcharged on B-2 parts,
according to congressional investigators and those involved in
civil suits against the company.
   The plea-bargain settlement was sealed, and Northrop officials
said the company was unable to discuss it with reporters under the
deal worked out with federal prosecutors.
   But in a memo to staff left in the company's lobby, Northrop
President Kent Kresa described how the MX probes had ended but
``some other legal issues remain open.''
   Those include a criminal probe of the B-2 program, prompted by a
civil ``whistle-blower'' lawsuit that seeks damages of $20 billion,
the sources said. Northrop has acknowledged that FBI agents raided
its B-2 parts plant in Pico Rivera on Feb. 15 and seized documents
related to the program.
   ``You can hardly raid them one week and let them plead out the
next,'' said an aide to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., whose House
Subcommittee on Investigations has conducted extensive hearings
into allegations of Northrop wrongdoing.
   Dingell released a statement protesting the sealing of the
settlement. ``The criminal justice system is supposed to be
available for review by all our citizens, but this represents
stealth justice,'' he said, a reference to the B-2 stealth bomber's
supposed ability to hide from radar.
   Grand juries in Los Angeles and Honolulu continue probes of
whether Northrop made political payoffs to South Korea, and a Texas
grand jury is looking into the allegations that Northrop cheated
the government in auctioning Customs Service contraband, said the
Dingell aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Herbert Hafif, the lawyer for the Northrop employees who filed
the suit alleging B-2 overcharges, said he had learned the federal
criminal probe into that case was continuing.
   Hafif is the lead attorney on several of the ``whistle-blower''
suits, in which present or former employees can sue on behalf of
the government and share in any damages recovered.
   Northrop's guilty plea in the cruise missile criminal case will
be admissible as evidence in Hafif's mirror civil lawsuit in the
case. In that case, which goes to trial this year, Hafif said he
will seek between $20 million and $30 million in damages from the
aerospace company.
   He also pointed out that while the criminal MX cases have been
dropped, civil lawsuits remain to be tried.
