   Engine failure caused the crash of an
Airbus-320 airliner last month in southern India, killing 92
people, news reports said Monday.
   A total of 146 people were on board the plane when it crashed
Feb. 14 at Bangalore.
   The news agency reports, quoting unidentified sources, said the
plane did not respond to a computer command or direct control of
the pilots when it deviated from the its flight path during descent.
   Press Trust of India and the United News of India said the
commands were given simultaneously after the plane started to go
down.
   ``There was sufficent time for the ill-fated aircraft to pull
up,'' Press Trust quoted one source as saying.
   The news agencies said the commands to bring the plane back
under control were given seven seconds before the crash.
   The news agencies said their sources had access to the readout
of the Digital Flight Recorder and the Cockpit Voice Recorder. The
devices log all changes in altitude, speed and direction, as well
as conversation among cockpit crew.
   The aircraft was purchased by the Indian Airlines three months
before the crash. The plane was manufactured by Airbus Industrie, a
European consortium based in Toulouse, France.

<HEAD>They Came to Spring Break to Build, Not Party</HEAD>

   While hundreds of thousands of college
students on spring break come to Florida to party in the sun, a few
came to build homes for the homeless.
   Seventeen American University students from Washington are
spending their vacation building homes for two needy families in
Brevard County as part of the Habitat for Humanity program.
   ``This group really wants to work,'' said Joy Willard-Williford,
project director for the South Brevard Habitat for Humanity. ``They
came with their hammers and tools and their nail aprons on. They
were all decked out.''
   The eight men and nine women, who arrived from the nation's
capital on Sunday, did want to know _ like most college students _
how far they would be from Daytona Beach, said Ms.
Willard-Williford.
   ``I said, `Ah-hah, that is why they are really here. They just
wanted to go to the beach,''' she said.
   But she discovered the students were uninterested in bikinis and
beer: They wanted to attend an Amnesty International rally.
   They are only taking off on Thursday, when half plan to head for
the beach and the other half to Disney World.
   The Habitat for Humanity chapter at American University has more
than 200 members and about 50 are spending their spring break
building homes in various communities, said Kate Hochberg, 20, a
group leader.
   ``It's very good for the young, idealistic types,'' Ms. Hochberg
said. ``It's something you can actually do to contribute.''

<DATELINE>TIMBUKTU, Mali (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Timbuktu was lucky last year. It rained,
the locusts stayed away and, with some help from the outside,
farmers produced one of the best harvests in half a century.
   Farmers in nearly all the countries that hug the southern Sahara
Desert's harsh border produced similar bumper crops that filled
graneries and children's bellies from Senegal east to Niger.
   The good fortune of 1988 and 1989, welcome as it is, also
illuminates the profound problems facing these poor nations
struggling to feed themselves _ problems that range from a
birthrate that outpaces production to a marketplace that stacks the
deck against even the hardest-working farmer.
   Experts note that, even with the bountiful harvest in most
countries, sub-Saharan Africa imported nearly 9 million tons of
cereal grains in 1988.
   ``Nonetheless, the 500,000-ton grain surplus is spectacular
news,'' said U.S. Ambassador Robert Pringle. ``Now everyone is
wondering how to export what they have grown.''
   Abduleh al Kalifa, hip-deep in a field of emerald-green wheat
rippling in a desert wind near Timbuktu, doesn't worry about
exporting. He just wishes he could sell his surplus 30 miles away,
in Timbuktu.
   ``Five years ago there was no rain, nothing to eat,'' said
Kalifa, 36, already middle-aged in a nation where the average life
expectancy is 49. ``Foreigners gave us everything. These last two
years, the harvests were good. We have hope and two warehouses are
full.
   ``We have more than we can eat, more than we can store and we
can't sell the rest,'' he said. ``How can we get our grain to town
if there are no roads? How can we compete with grain from other
countries? How can we earn enough money to buy food when there is
another drought?''
   Mali's last drought left its mark on the children. Two-year-olds
are solid and round, but children born in the drought of 1984-1985
are spindly, apt to suffer from chronic malnutrition.
   ``If you are malnourished, a few good meals will make you feel
better, but you are still malnourished,'' said Leo DeVos, director
of the United Nations Children's Fund in Mali. ``The whole country
is like these children. It will take more than a couple of good
harvests to put the country back on its feet.
   ``Still, it's nice to see the green,'' he said. ``It is the
color of hope.''
   When UNICEF arrived five years ago with emergency food, the
government was in chaos, people were starving and huge numbers of
refugees arrived in cities each day from the barren countryside.
   Enormous need remained when the crisis ended, so UNICEF and
others stayed on to help.
   The United States, which spends about $30 million a year in
Mali, now helps entrepreneurs and small farmers. West Germany built
warehouses for reserves and a highway that spans a nation as large
as Texas and California combined.
   France, Italy and others fight the advance of the desert, dig
wells, organize cooperatives and help in dozens of other ways.
   UNICEF has concentrated on Timbuktu, a once-mysterious oasis
that still evokes romance and adventure.
   Centuries ago, Timbuktu was a crossroads of caravans, a center
of learning and a garden in the desert, where the river ran deep
and trees hung heavy with fruit.
   Now, the advancing desert has tied a noose of dunes around it
and many donors have written the city off as a lost cause.
   With funds donated by Italian labor unions, UNICEF installed
pumps to make use of Niger River water and drilled wells to tap
ground water for irrigation.
   ``We wanted to set an example, to show what could be done in
even the most precarious situation,'' DeVos said. One result of the
five-year project was the field where Kalifa and his neighbors grew
a 15-ton grain surplus, little of which can be sold.
   The Malian government used to have price controls, which kept
food costs down and made urban voters happy, but discouraged
farmers because of the low return on their labor. Controls were
abolished at the insistence of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund.
   International donors and lenders also demanded that Mali
eliminate protectionist measures and subsidies to farmers. Their
message was simple: No open markets, no aid.
   ``We have a long-term commitment to food aid, in return for
which we ask that the entire cereal market be freed,'' said Dennis
Brennan, director of the U.S. Agency for International Development
in Bamako.
   With the market wide open, rice from Thailand and Louisiana
costs less in the Timbuktu bazaar than grain grown down the road.
   ``The little guy works like crazy to grow something, pulling
grain from soil that is poor, in primitive conditions and in a
climate that is never favorable, even when there is no drought,''
said Giovanni Fiore, director of UNICEF's Timbuktu project and an
Africa veteran.
   Then, when the farmer produces a surplus, there are no buyers.
No one in the villages has any cash and consumers in Timbuktu buy
whatever is cheapest.
   ``It comes from Europe or the United States where farmers
receive subsidies,'' Fiore said. ``How can a Malian compete? He has
no subsidy. All he has is taxes and the high cost of the pump,
gasoline, oil, fertilizer, all of which has to be imported at
double, triple, 10 times the cost to an American.
   ``Meanwhile, the donors tie aid to an open market in which
farmers from developed countries can sell their surplus. So our
farmers eat what they can, store a little, which will last a year
or two, and when there is another extended drought, there will be
famine.''

<HEAD>Inner-City Teen-agers Come to Terms With Death _ and Life _ at The

   The kids go to Chez Vous to roller skate and
gossip, to share sodas and stories. And for a safe haven from the
gunfire of the streets.
   Now they also come to weep at ``The Wall,'' a stark memorial
inscribed with the names of 65 teen-agers who have died in recent
years on Boston's streets.
   ``They come over and see the names of friends and relatives,''
said Dorcas Dunham, who with her husband runs the inner-city roller
skating rink. ``They're starting to see the reality and they're
crying out.''
   They're seeing death in a black-and-white list that grows longer
every day, a list that includes the names of gang members gunned
down by their rivals and innocent kids caught in the crossfire.
   The war has claimed 28 lives in Boston aleady this year. If the
pace continues, The Wall will soon be filled. No one wants to start
another.
   The memorial hangs in a corner at the 50-year-old rink in the
city's Dorchester section. It's housed behind a reinforced door and
around the corner from one of the city's busiest police precincts.
The teen-age skaters are all frisked for weapons and agree to play
by the rules: no gum, no smoking, no fighting, no profanity.
   The Rev. Bruce Wall, a minister and youth counselor, tacked the
names of four more victims to the list Saturday afternoon. When the
kids came in Saturday night, they looked 8 feet up and noticed the
additions.
   ``They come in and go for their skates and start looking for
their friends,'' said Wall, who is also a Juvenile Court clerk
magistrate. ``Then they stop and stare ... and stare.''
   Faces go with these names. ``It's like you can almost see the
kids remembering them, their classmates and friends,'' said John
Dunham, who with his wife keeps tabs on as many as 350 teen-agers
on a busy night at the rink.
   ``They're overwhelmed and then they seem, like, broken with
despair,'' said Dunham. They're tired of seeing friends' faces on
the evening news and hearing ``that another one bit the dust,'' he
said.
   Dunham said he sees it in the way the kids' shoulders slump as
they read the words scrawled across the memorial: ``Dedicated To
Those Youth Who Died Before Their Time.''
   Sometimes he stands back a few feet and just watches the
emotions and tears wash over the teen-agers' faces.
   ``Some of them don't even come to skate anymore. They just come
to look at The Wall,'' Dunham said. ``They're learning about
respecting life ... and that there are no second chances.''
   Audrey Moore knows there are no second chances. Her 11-year-old
sister, Tiffany, is on the list. Tiffany was shot down by a stray
bullet one summer day two years ago as she sat on a mailbox in her
neighborhood.
   ``I talk to the gang members and try to get through,'' she said.
``I know none of them want to see one of their own on The Wall.
Maybe this will make them stop and think.''
   Dunham said he thinks the message is getting through. He watches
the kids leave the rink at night, cutting a wide path around the
groups that hang outside looking for trouble after closing.
   He has seen fights start erupting inside the rink and has seen
them cut short when a kid stands up and points toward The Wall.
   ``They say, `Don't you all see that? Look at all our friends _
dead,' and then things get real quiet,'' he said. ``We're planting
a seed of hope here.''
   That's what it's all about, activists said. The memorial is
about dealing with death and staking a claim to life. It's one
piece of a bigger effort to turn things around in these tired
communities, where people sleep on their floors to stay out of the
line of fire at night.
   The effort includes an anti-drug hotline, crimewatches and
classes on civil rights for the youngers who are stopped and
searched for arms. It includes meetings and marches, one of which
was held on The Wall's inauguration day March 3.
   ``The idea for The Wall has a lot to do with the Vietnam War
Memorial,'' said Dunham, who put up the memorial with his wife and
Rev. Wall. ``That was a battle and so is this, even if a lot of the
kids don't know it.''

<TEXT>
   Two days after Israel's army captured east
Jerusalem in 1967, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan ordered removal of
all barriers dividing the Holy City's Arab and Jewish sectors.
   Dayan's decisive action ended a division that existed since the
Jewish state was founded in 1948.
   He brushed aside fears of some Israeli officials that fighting
would break out between Arabs and Jews, recalling in his biography
that he told them, ``we could deal later with whatever problems may
arise.''
   On Tuesday, 23 years later, the sensitive problem of Jerusalem
was largely to blame for the collapse of Israel's coalition
government in a dispute between Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
Likud bloc and the center-left Labor Party.
   Labor accepted U.S. proposals to include east Jerusalem Arabs in
a Palestinian delegation to peace talks with Israel. Likud was
opposed, fearing Israel's control of all Jerusalem could be called
into question.
   The dispute reached a crisis when Shamir hardened his stance
after a comment by President Bush equating the Jewish suburbs
around Jerusalem with settlements in the occupied West Bank.
   ``I hear the voices coming today from Washington on the issue of
Jerusalem, things that enrage every Jew in Israel, and I have to
react,'' the 74-year-old Shamir angrily declared.
   Bush had said nothing to change American policy, which has never
recognized the annexation of the Arab sector into Israel's
``eternal, undivided capital'' after the land was seized from
Jordan in the 1967 war.
   But the American president reignited an issue that is the most
emotional one of the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Jerusalem
is a city holy to both Jews and Moslems.
   For Jews, it is at the heart of Israel's very existence, the
site of King Solomon's ancient temple, the symbol of God's promise
to return the Jews from exile.
   While many Israelis can accept trading the West Bank and Gaza
Strip for peace, few are willing to give up any part of Jerusalem.
Even those who are not deeply religious think of the city as theirs.
   In the hilltop, fortress-like suburb of Gilo that Israel has
built on captured territory south of the city, laborer Menachem
Ben-Tlulia was asked his views of living on ``occupied'' land.
   ``I don't understand all this politics,'' said Ben-Tlulia, who
immigrated six years ago from Morocco. ``I feel like I live in the
city of Jerusalem, our city, all of it.''
   In East Talpiot, another suburb once in Arab territory, Shlomo
Einstein complained about Bush comparing parts of Jerusalem to the
settlements where Jews live among the 1.7 million Palestinians of
the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``I don't feel like I live in a settlement,'' said the
56-year-old psychologist. ``Areas outside Jerusalem are
settlements.''
   Gilo and East Talpiot are among seven neighborhoods built by
Israel on 18,000 acres of Arab land it annexed.
   On Tuesday, Housing Minister David Levy, a Likud member, laid
the cornerstone for a new development to house 3,500 Israelis.
   The Hebrew daily Haaretz wrote that building of the Jewish
suburbs was ``based on a policy intended to emphasize the constant
Israeli presence in all areas within the boundaries of Jerusalem's
jurisdiction.''
   Now, 120,000 of Jerusalem's 340,000 Jewish residents live in
these suburbs, virtually surrounding the city's 140,000 Palestinian
residents.
   For Palestinians, Jerusalem also is a religious and political
heritage.
   The Dome of the Rock mosque, built in the 7th century, stands on
the spot where Moslems believe Mohammed ascended to heaven. For
Palestinian Christians, the city is a living reminder of Jesus'
crucifixion and resurrection.
   The leading Palestinian families _ the Husseinis, the
Nashashibis, the Nusseibehs _ have lived in Jerusalem for
centuries. The PLO's Parliament-in-exile, founded in east Jerusalem
in 1964, declared two years ago that the city was the capital of
its would-be Palestinian state.
   Sari Nusseibeh, a Palestinian professor of philosphy, echoes
Israeli politicians when he says the question of Jerusalem ``is not
subject to negotiations.''
   ``East Jerusalem is the capital of the occupied Palestinian
state,'' Nusseibeh said. ``The unilateral action of Israel having
annexed it does not change the historical facts and the political
facts.''
   Housing Minister Levy was just as determined when he inaugurated
the new Jewish suburb Tuesday in east Jerusalem. ``Building
determines our future here,'' he said. ``This is our united
capital. Jerusalem is the heart of every Jew, eternally.''
   For most of the past 23 years, the Arab-Israeli dispute over
Jerusalem remained largely beneath the surface. But it burst forth
at the start of the Palestinian uprising 27 months ago.
   East Jerusalem's Palestinians joined those in the occupied lands
in resisting Israeli rule. In the first year of the revolt, police
found 1,229 illegal Palestinian flags flying in Jerusalem. The
slayings of four Israelis and six Palestinians in the city have
been linked to the uprising.

<HEAD>Senate Subcommittee Hears Testimony on Compensation for Uranium
Miners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHIPROCK, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to compensate poisoned uranium
miners brought ``a day of hope'' to long-neglected workers who
provided the raw material for American's burgeoning nuclear
programs, former U.S. Interior Secretary Stewart Udall said Tuesday.
   Udall spoke at a hearing on a bill co-sponsored by Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., to establish a $100 million trust fund for the
workers _ many of them Navajo Indians _ who worked uranium mines in
New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah between 1947 and 1971.
   ``I support compensation for the uranium miners, both Indian and
non-Indian, because of the service they performed for our nation,''
Domenici said. ``In the course of that service, a number of them
suffered from very, very serious diseases. It is time that we
recognize that fact and set to work righting the wrong that began
more than 40 years ago.''
   He said 250 to 350 uranium miners or their beneficiaries would
receive compensation under the bill, which would provide $100,000
awards to miners suffering lung cancer and other diseases.
   For more than 20 years, according to testimony, the miners dug
uranium ore without warnings from their employers or the
government. They breathed radioactive dust, ate their lunches deep
in the mineshafts and even drank contaminated mine water.
   The bill also would compensate with $50,000 each residents of
Nevada and Utah who can prove they were exposed to radiation
fallout from nuclear testing.
   ``The bill in a small way will make up for the mistakes made in
the early days in the uranium mines,'' Domenici said. `We could
never replace the ones that died or those who are ill, but this is
a giant step.''
   Udall, who once sued the government on behalf of injured miners,
said the government's treatment of the Navajos was especially
grievous. ``The government not only didn't warn them, it was
flagrant malpractice to do what they did,'' Udall said.
   He said the hearing of the Senate subcommittee on mineral
resources development and production before 600 people at a high
school gym, brought ``a day of hope'' to the Navajo community.
   Navajo interim Chairman Leonard Haskie said the Public Health
Service conducted a study in 1949 of radiation and knew then the
dangers to the miners. ``In order to proceed with its study, PHS
decided not to tell miners of the hazards for fear that many miners
would quit, which would interrupt the production of uranium,''
Haskie said. ``Families continue to be exposed because many mines
are still open. Children play in them.''
   Susan Dawson, assistant sociology professor at Utah State
University, said miners were never informed of the dangers or their
rights under state worker's compensation laws when they became ill.
   ``One Navajo foreman said mine owners told him not to tell the
workers about the dangers of radiation,'' she said.

   At twilight in a black-top parking
lot, Jeffrey Dryfka fell dead with a .25-caliber bullet through the
back. So ended ``Seven Years of Hell,'' the title of his unfinished
journal.
   Through Dryfka's writings, telephone records and tales from the
back streets of south Florida, police pieced together a bizarre
tale of obsession in which Dryfka was allegedly stalked by a former
homosexual lover. The man had boasted the hunt would end in death,
authorities said.
   ``This guy said he would not rest until Jeff Dryfka was dead,''
said Detective John Donadio. ``If he couldn't have him, no one
could. It's much weirder than the movie `Fatal Attraction' because
it's true.''
   Last week, a grand jury indicted James Charles Barfield, 47, for
first-degree murder in the Feb. 17 slaying. Prosecutors will seek
the death penalty.
   ``The poor victim was hounded,'' said Broward State Attorney
Brian Cavanagh.
   The story of Dryfka, 26, and Barfield, which began with small
talk on a park bench, illuminates a shadowy side of south Florida.
Each night young runaways, prostitutes and junkies _ and those who
prey off their weaknesses _ bargain and barter away under the
bug-encircled street lamps.
   ``This is a good lesson of how someone can get caught up in the
sick side of society without even knowing it at first,'' Donadio
said.
   The beginning of Dryfka's journal describes how at 18 years old
he was sent from the home of his mother and stepfather in San Diego
to his father's apartment in West Palm Beach.
   ``I had the perfect life,'' he wrote of San Diego. ``I had a
pool in the backyard, a skateboard, friends and girlfriends.''
   But in Florida, he was lonely. His father worked at sea for a
salvage company. Dryfka began hanging out at a park where he could
buy marijuana.
   He befriended Barfield, a chain-smoking man with a limp who
lived off welfare and disability checks, and over the strong
objections of his family, soon moved in with him.
   Barfield spent 16 years in prison for convictions including
sodomizing a 13-year-old boy at gunpoint, said Donadio.
   From 1982 to 1989, Dryfka exchanged sex for housing and money,
some of which was spent on cocaine and marijuana. Police say Dryfka
tried for years to leave, but each time Barfield would find him and
persuade him to return.
   On Sept. 18, Dryfka moved out for good. He told Barfield he was
moving back to San Diego, but remained in Florida, dyed his hair
blond, painted his pickup truck black and began dating a woman.
   Barfield took a bus to San Diego and discovered Dryfka was not
there. He then began a string of threatening telephone calls to
Dryfka's family, making at least 150 calls to Dryfka's mother from
September to January, Donadio said. Barfield sometimes demanded
money.
   ``He'd say stuff like, `You want to see your next birthday?'''
said Donadio. ``Then he'd laugh. He has this Charlie Manson-type
laugh. ... This guy is totally wacko.''
   During the hunt, Barfield posed as a police officer, a banker
and other officials, authorities said. Knowing Dryfka's social
security number, credit cards and date of birth helped persuade
others to give out information.
   The break came Feb. 3 when Barfield contacted Palm Beach County
probation officials who were monitoring Dryfka after he violated
probation on cocaine possession charges. They told him Dryfka
turned in an ankle bracelet that's used for tracking violators
ordered confined to their homes.
   Dryfka knew Barfield was getting close. On Feb. 15, the day he
had gotten engaged, a car sped by and the driver shouted at him.
   ``He knew that was Barfield,'' said Donadio. ``His girlfriend _
who was very naive about the whole thing _ was traumatized, to say
the least.''
   The next day, Dryfka told his landlord he wanted his fiancee to
have all his possessions if he was killed.
   Police say Barfield took a cab to an air-conditioning repair
company where Dryfka worked, and let the air out of a tire on
Dryfka's truck. Dryfka drove about a half-block before realizing
the tire was flat. When he got out, he was shot in the back.
   Dryfka's father has since moved to West Virginia. His fiancee
now lives somewhere in the Northeast, police said.
   ``So many lives messed up by this one guy,'' said Donadio. ``I'm
sure this was the farthest thing from Jeffrey's mind that first day
he met Barfield.''
   The subtitle of Dryfka's journal: ``I have my own life, too.''

<TEXT>
   Poland's borders are again an issue in
European politics, as they have been during peace and war for more
than 300 years.
   This time, Poland is wary that a united Germany will want to
change frontiers established after the German defeat in World War
II and reopen the ``Polish Question'' that has vexed European
diplomacy for centuries.
   In 1688, Poland stretched from the Baltic Sea almost to the
Black Sea and its territory encompassed much of what is now the
Ukraine and Byelorussia.
   A century later, a united Poland and Lithuania came under
pressure from Russia, Austria and Prussia and was systematically
dismembered in three stages between 1772 and 1795, when Poland
ceased to exist.
   The country was not established again until 1919.
   The traditional fragility of Poland's borders and the need to
guarantee them was behind Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's
determined campaign to win a place at talks on German reunification.
   In the 20th century, Europe has been reshaped three times around
Poland: after World War I, in the secret 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov
Pact and in 1945 at meetings of the victorious Allies in Yalta and
Potsdam.
   Through it all, Poles have endured borders that were seldom of
their own choosing and have become obsessed with the issue.
   ``People who live on islands, or on half continents of their
own, find difficulty in comprehending the territorial obsessions of
land-locked nations,'' historian Norman Davies wrote of Poland in
``God's Playground, A History of Poland.''
   ``Never having faced the prospect of ceding Kent to Germany or
California to the U.S.S.R., they tend to look with quizzical
unconcern, if not contempt, on those who would lay down their lives
for an inch of ground or for a dotted line on a map.''
   After Russia, Prussia and Austria erased Poland in 1795, Poles
kept alive dreams for their own state. Their chance came in 1919
after the World War I collapse of the three partioning powers. The
separated parts of Poland united to establish their own government.
   President Woodrow Wilson of the United States had made an
``independent and autonomous Poland with free, unrestricted access
to the sea'' one of his Fourteen Points in the postwar settlement.
   Through a combination of negotiations, plebiscites and military
actions that lasted until 1922 and managed to alienate all its
neighbors, Poland carved out a saddle-shaped territory with a
narrow corridor to the Baltic dividing the main body of Germany
from East Prussia.
   The oddly contoured country bordered Romania in the extreme
southeast and included Vilnius, the heavily Polish-populated city
in Lithuania.
   Though shrunken, Poland was roughly similar in outline to the
Poland that existed in 1772.
   The re-establishment of an independent state caused bitterness
in Germany and the Soviet Union.
   The main irritant was the so-called Polish corridor to the
Baltic guaranteed by the victorious World War I powers at
Versailles. It made the German city of Danzig (now Gdansk) at the
mouth of the Vistula River into a ``free city'' under protection of
the League of Nations, with Poland and Germany sharing some
administrative responsibilities.
   The German government of the 1920s and Adolf Hitler's regime of
the 1930s agitated to get Danzig and to recover its ``historic
lands'' in the corridor.
   After incorporating Austria in 1938 and Czechoslovakia in early
1939, Danzig and the Polish corridor became Hitler's target.
   The green light to invade came on Aug. 23, 1939, when Foreign
Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop of Germany and Foreign Minister
Vychaleslav Molotov of the Soviet Union signed a secret pact
splitting Poland between them. Nine days later, Hitler launched the
invasion of Poland that began World War II.
   The Soviets occupied the country's eastern half on Sept. 17.
   The Polish state again vanished and the peaceful border between
Germany and the Soviet Union lasted until June 22, 1941, when
Hitler invaded the Soviet Union.
   At an Allied conferences at Yalta and Potsdam in 1945, Stalin
insisted on keeping most of the territory he had gained in eastern
Poland in 1939. In all, the Soviet Union claimed 46 percent of
prewar Poland, or 71,288 square miles.
   To compensate Poland, the Allies approved the transfer to the
Soviet-dominated Polish government of 40,480 square miles of
formerly German territory.
   Although Poland was technically on the winning side of the war,
it lost about one-fifth of its territory and came under control of
a Soviet-assembled government and the Red Army.
   Communist domination lasted until 1989, when the Solidarity
movement forced partially free elections that brought Mazowiecki to
office.
   Because no formal peace treaty establishing the western frontier
was ever signed, the status of the Polish-German border on the Oder
and Neisse rivers described in the Aug. 2, 1945, Potsdam agreement
has remained somewhat nebulous. The Potsdam agreement itself said
the Oder-Neisse line was to exist only ``pending the final
determination of Poland's western frontiers.''
   Meanwhile, millions of ethnic Germans fled or were expelled,
while Poles from the Soviet-annexed eastern territories flooded in.
Formerly German cities like Stettin and Breslau were renamed
Szczecin and Wroclaw.
   East Germany, under Stalinist control, recognized the Polish
border in 1950. West Germany, in a treaty signed by then-Chancellor
Willi Brandt, recognized it in 1970.
   But Kohl, apparently concerned about political supporters who do
not want to renounce claims to the area, has hestitated to commit a
reunited Germany to the Oder-Neisse line. He has said it is a
matter for a freely elected government that unites East and West
Germany.

   The fall fashion message from London is short,
sporty by day and slinky by night, with flashes of British wit and
individuality.
   The mood among designers, however, is uncertain.
   Top designers Katherine Hamnett and John Galliano skipped London
to show in Paris. Two other big names, Rifat Ozbek and Jaspar
Conran, opted for videos instead of catwalk shows, and fewer buyers
stopped off in London en route from Milan to Paris.
   Nonetheless, there was still some of that old wacky madness that
put London on the fashion map.
   Vivienne Westwood, the mother of punk garb, captivated the
audience with a collection ranging from classic tailored tartan
suits to fake fur-trimmed bloomers worn with Old Master-print
corsets.
   A Lycra-clad dancing troupe dressed as haute couture pigs opened
the show based on barnyard characters of country life. Bodymap did
a vision of drag-queen club life in their sexy sportswear
collection.
   Britain's designers of the year, Workers For Freedom duo Richard
Nott and Graham Fraser, showed a collection Nott described as
``spare feminity,'' which featured bikinis over striped body suits,
one of the key fall looks from London.
   London Fashion Week, which ends Tuesday, has spread out even
further with designers showing all over town and the trade show
featuring about 250 exhibitors at the Olympia 2 exhibition hall.
   At Olympia, accessories from hats to bracelets seemed hotter
than clothes.
   ``I think largely because of high interest rates and the high
cost of living, women can't afford to buy another outfit, so
they're buying accessories,'' said Beverley Mann, 28, one of the
design duo of the costume jewelry firm Flash Harry.
   Melanie Lazlo of Obsession, another costume jewelry firm, said:
``London is kind of a melting pot for a wide range of accessories
ranging from the weird and wonderful to the Channel-type classic.''
   Many fashion designers said the number of buyers was down.
   ``It's much quieter than it was last year,'' said David Sassoon
of Belville Sassoon-Lorcan Mullany, one of London's top eveningwear
designers.
   ``I think stores everywhere are having a hard time,'' he said.
``Where money's tight, they want selling clothes. They don't want
jokes. ... They don't want over the top things they might have
indulged in previously.''
   Benny Ong, another leading designer whose soft, sensual clothes
sell internationally, agreed that the economic situation was
keeping buyers away from London.
   ``That's why it's important at those times when the economic
situation is not so hot to go for color _ to pick yourself up,'' he
said. ``Power-dressing has also changed to something more feminine
and confident.''
   Edina Ronay, bucking the trend with her first catwalk show, said
her business was up and insisted London was ``not going to fall
flat on its face because two people show in Paris,''
   Her collection of suits and parkas in orange, ochre and olive,
fur-trimmed and brocade hooded jackets and skin-tight gold lame and
black tops and body suits won high marks for wearability.
   There were plenty other wearable clothes as well.
   Bruce Oldfield, who designs many of Princess Diana's dresses,
incorporated the sporty spirit in his hooded, printed parkas,
luxurious velvet bodysuits, sequined sweatshirts and a
gold-sequined bomber jacket with pants.
   Caroline Charles did a ``Eurochic'' collection featuring
Romanian peasant embroideries and folksy tapestry and fringing
alongside her snappy city suits and slinky evening dresses.
   Ozbek abandoned his summer white for dazzling colors _ another
fall theme _ in hooded tops, tunics, cropped bomber jackets and
leggings and body suits in dazzling sequins, stretch velvet and
gold lame.
   Conran found his inspiration in ``the off-duty ballerina,'' with
body-hugging catsuits topped by cropped leather jackets and quilted
bronze bomber jackets.
   Helen Story, one of the up-and-coming young designers, had fun
with a soccer-for-women look, again featuring hooded bomber jackets
and soccer shorts with her signature fringing.

<HEAD>Coup Attempt Weakens President Najib, But His Fall Seen Unlikely</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Last week's attempt to topple
President Najib has brought the Soviet-supported leader to his
lowest point since he was installed in 1986.
   But despite his setback and a brush with death when bombs fell
12 feet from his office, Najib seems unlikely to fall.
   In thwarting the coup attempt by Defense Minister Shaw Nawaz
Tanai, Najib once again demonstrated his ability to juggle
allegiances within the party and come out on top. No other leader
has yet emerged _ or been permitted to emerge _ with a following
that rivals Najib's.
   He has also made an effort to expand his predominantly urban
base to the countryside. Najib has made overtures to minorities,
such as various ethnic groups and the Shia Moslems, who make up 18
percent of predominantly Sunni Moslem Afghanistan.
   There is likely to be even more disunity and bloodshed following
the attempt to overthrow him.
   About 1.5 million Afghans already have died in the 12-year-old
civil war, which saw nine years of direct Soviet intervention,
three coups and numerous purges. Efforts to end the war between the
government and U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas are expected to take a
back seat as Najib tries to consolidate his own position.
   Faced with questionable loyalty in the armed forces, Najib is
expected to turn to tribal militia leaders for military support,
foreign diplomats and Afghan officials say.
   In exchange, the tribal leaders will undoubtedly demand more
autonomy from the central government.
   ``We expect the already high level of lawlessness in the
countryside to rise,'' one foreign diplomat said, speaking on
condition he not be identified further.
   Even if the military regains Najib's trust, its firepower and
manpower have been weakened. Diplomats estimate that 10 fighter
jets and numerous other military aircraft were lost during the
mutineers' bombardment of Kabul and the government's retaliation.
   Bagram air base, a major center of the coup plot, was virtually
destroyed, according to most assessments. In addition, hundreds of
high-ranking officers and elite commandos are believed to have been
killed on both sides.
   Sultan Ali Keshtmand, who as chairman of the council of
ministers is the country's de facto prime minister, met the heads
of foreign diplomatic missions in Kabul on Saturday and pleaded for
aid.
   ``We have been severely weakened by the coup,'' a senior Asian
diplomat quoted Keshtmand as saying. Keshtmand requested food,
medicine and greater political support, the diplomat said.
   Najib's position also has been hurt within his own People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which is split between Najib's
Parcham or ``Flag'' faction and the more hawkish Khalq or
``Masses'' faction.
   Tanai, who led the March 6 coup attempt, was a prominent Khalqi
and Najib apparently was forced to make concessions to other
Khalqis in exchange for their support during the coup attempt.
   The diplomats, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said this
was illustrated by the president's subsequent Cabinet reshuffle.
   Najib purged Tanai and at least four other top Khalqis from the
party after the attempted coup, but he promoted two others _ Lt.
Gen. Mohammad Aslam Watanjar and Raz Mohammad Pakteen. Both
Watanjar and Pakteen could ultimately prove troublesome because
they are thought to have little loyalty to Najib.
   Watanjar, the former interior minister, succeeded Tanai as
defense minister. Watanjar persuaded most of the army's 15th
armored division, which he once commanded, to abandon its initial
support for Tanai, Eastern European diplomats and two Afghan
government sources said.
   Pakteen was given Watanjar's old job in the Interior Ministry,
which is responsible for the country's intelligence agencies. He
appears to be largely a figurehead, the diplomats said. Najib,
former head of the dreaded KHAD secret police, actually controls
the ministry, they added.
   The failed coup also exacerbated the already bitter splits among
the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, who have been trying to
oust Najib and his predecessors since shortly after the party
grabbed power in a 1978 coup.
   Extreme fundamentalist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar embraced the coup,
and his people now are trying to strike deals with Tanai, according
diplomatic sources in Kabul and in neighboring Pakistan where the
mujahedeen are based.
   But other mujahedeen groups, including some of the staunchest
fundamentalists, have distanced themselves from the coup, saying
they find no difference between Najib and Tanai.
   An Eastern European diplomat in Kabul said there was a
possibility Tanai might be persuaded to take command of the
stalemated mujahedeen offensive against Khost, his home turf.
   If Tanai, a gifted military tactician, succeeds in taking Khost,
it would give the anti-Najib forces an important staging area for
attacks deeper into Afghanistan and closer to Kabul.
   ``We could see Afghanistan carved up more than it already is,''
the Eastern European diplomat said.
   Still, none of the diplomats and military experts interviewed in
Kabul said he thought the rebels were capable of toppling Najib.
   ``The stalemate will continue,'' one of the military experts
said. ``It will just get bloodier.''

<HEAD>Railroad Crew Shoos Moose Away From Deadly Trains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASILLA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaning out the window of a pickup doing
35 mph, its siren whooping, Jack Burton aimed his shotgun and fired
a blank that exploded near a galloping moose framed in the
headlights 20 yards ahead.
   ``She's moved over,'' Burton yelled. ``Let's get ahead of her.''
   Highballing through the moonlit Susitna Valley in a one-ton
pickup equipped to ride the rails, Burton and Ken Hightower were on
night moose patrol for the Alaska Railroad.
   They were shooing moose from the rails on the
Anchorage-to-Fairbanks run, where 603 of the lumbering animals have
been killed so far this winter _ more than twice the winter
average. The reason: the deepest snow in 25 years.
   The moose are hungry and worn out from staggering for food
through snow deeper than their legs are long. When one of the
animals stumbles across the plowed railroad tracks where the
walking is easy, it tends to remain until the moose patrol scares
it off or a train runs it down.
   ``They can handle any other situation, probably, but they don't
do too well against the iron horse,'' said Bill Collins, a state
wildlife biologist.
   Many of the moose are killed after dark, when they come out to
feed.
   The railroad has been trying for five years to find a way to
stop killing moose. This year the effort has cost $337,000 in
expenses and train delays, spokeswoman Vivian Hamilton said.
   The number of moose killed by the railroad may not seem like
much out of a local population of 15,000, but every animal counts,
Collins said. He expects 90 percent of the calves born last fall to
die before the heavy snows melt.
   State wildlife officials and volunteers have begun putting out
hay for the moose, even though the animals have trouble digesting
it.
   ``By feeding them they are trying to keep them from wandering
back and forth across the highway and the railroad,'' Collins said.
``Once you start feeding them, they tend to stay put.''
   Leaving a shed, Burton and Hightower headed toward Eklutna, then
left the highway and drove over squeaky snow through the Tanaina
Indian village of 50 people with its Russian Orthodox church of
logs and hand-hewn onion domes.
   At milepost 142 they jockeyed the pickup onto the rails and
jacked in the steel dollies that let it run like a train. Burton
loaded a shotgun with ``kracker'' shells _ blanks that explode with
a small flame but have no shot.
   On the citizens band radio, an engineer reported his freight
train had gone by milepost 139.
   ``Roger that, we're at 142 and rolling at 35,'' Burton answered,
matching the speed of the train.
   Several miles later, the eyes of a moose reflected the spotlight
long before its huge brown bulk materialized out of the darkness.
When the moose saw the pickup, it ran, loping along the middle of
the tracks rather than going into the deep snow to let it pass.
   ``Normally they will fight or flee,'' Collins said. ``If they
fight they are in trouble. If they flee they are still in trouble.''
   That's where Burton's version of the squeeze play comes in.
   With Hightower at the wheel and Burton riding shotgun, the
pickup followed the moose. Finally the animal strayed and Hightower
gunned the engine, slowly passing it.
   Ahead was a railroad bridge, where Hightower parked the truck to
block the moose from trying to cross. If it got on the bridge, the
moose would fall between the ties, breaking its legs or pitching
head first into the creek to drown.
   ``We're stopped at the bridge,'' Burton radioed to the freight.
   Minutes later the freight approached and slowed to a stop, the
engine headlight and numbers shining.
   Caught in a squeeze between the train and the truck, the moose
tossed its head and reluctantly walked down a trail cut through the
8-foot-high snow berm by volunteers from a snow-machine club.
   ``Good moose,'' Hightower said.

   Lithuania's declaration of independence from
the Soviet Union poses the most serious threat in 70 years to the
unity of the communist state but leaves the United States able to
offer little but the most muted applause.
   The fear: Too much encouragement to tiny Lithuania could provoke
a Soviet crackdown, do serious damage to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's program of economic and political reform and even
weaken his tenacious grasp on power.
   And since there is little the United States could do to affect
the outcome in Lithuania and in other independence-minded Soviet
republics, there might be real danger in trying.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III set the tone for U.S.
policy in Capitol Hill testimony last week, saying that the United
States ``ought not to gloat too much over our success.''
   ``It is not overly productive to stick a stick in their eye just
for the hell of it,'' Baker said.
   ``The fear is that the unraveling of the Soviet Union is not
necessarily a success for us,'' said Ilya Prizel, professor of
Soviet studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University.
   ``If it ends up in a civil war, how do you deal with a civil war
in a superpower that sits on thousands and thousands of nuclear
weapons?'' Prizel asked.
   The administration's careful litany on Lithuania, as delivered
by the White House and State Department on Monday, goes like this:
   _The United States recognized the independence of Lithuania and
two other Baltic states in 1922 after the victors in World War I
carved them out of the fallen Russian empire.
   _That diplomatic recognition has never been withdrawn.
   _The United States never accepted the secret non-aggression 1940
deal between Germany's Adolf Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin
folding Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet empire.
   _It still regards their transformation into Soviet republics as
illegal.
   _But in the last analysis, Washington is prepared to recognize
Lithuania diplomatically and exchange ambassadors with it only if
negotiations with Moscow give it the attributes of a nation-state.
   ``We would want any recognition to take into account a final
government that was in control of its own destiny, and much of that
has yet to be negotiated with the Soviet Union,'' said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Diplomatic recognition would follow ``once that government is in
effective control of its territory and capable of entering into and
fulfilling international obligations,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``I think it's a prudent and correct policy,'' Prizel said. ``We
cannot jump in ahead of the Soviet Union. We should understand that
we can provoke the Soviets, but we cannot deter them.''
   ``Do you want to encourage the Lithuanians to a point where the
Russians crack down; then what do you do?'' he asked. ``You might
bring a terrible fate down upon them.''
   Prizel's conclusion: ``I think the best thing to do is to lie as
low as we can and let the situation evolve in a way that Moscow
does not find provocative.''
   ``It's one thing for a Soviet leader to get rid of the outer
empire in Eastern Europe,'' he said. ``But it's quite a different
thing to preside over the disintegration of the Soviet Union.''
   But others believe that granting independence to Lithuania and
the other Baltic states is unlikely to lead to such a drastic
result.
   Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., acting chief of the Lithuanian legation
here, which has been maintained with U.S. cooperation for the last
half-century, says he believes Moscow will erect barriers to full
independence but will ultimately agree.
   Rozanne L. Ridgway, former assistant secretary of state for
European affairs, said on public television's ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour'' that she believes the Soviets will eventually see the
wisdom of granting Lithuania independence.
   If Gorbachev does not ``paint himself into a corner by using the
wrong words,'' she said, ``I think in the end you will see an
independent Lithuania.''

   A teen-ager who borrowed two of
his father's guns because a older boy was picking on him was shot
in the face and killed by a friend while fooling around with the
weapons, police said.
   ``This is a very careless, negligent, tragic act, especially
with young kids,'' said police Capt. Thomas Burke. ``Guns should be
stored in a locked place, with ammunition kept in a separate locked
place.''
   Chad MacDonald died Sunday, a day after the shooting at his
home. He would have turned 16 on Monday.
   His 14-year-old friend, who was not identified, was arraigned
Monday on juvenile charges of murder and weapons possession. He was
released to his parents' custody.
   MacDonald's parents said their son had taken his father's 9mm
semiautomatic pistol and a .357-caliber Magnum revolver to his room
without permission because he had been frightened by an older boy.
   Debra MacDonald said she and her husband had filed several
complaints with police because her son had been repeatedly harassed
by the older youth.
   Burke said the 14-year-old, who was sleeping over in preparation
for Chad's birthday party, told authorities he took the
semiautomatic from a dresser and fired at MacDonald after he had
pointed the revolver at him and said ``bang.''
   As an 8-year-old, Chad received a National Heroism Award from
the Boy Scouts for summoning help for his mother when she suffered
collapsed lungs.
   Glenn MacDonald said the family harbored no ill feelings toward
the boy accused of killing his son.
   ``He is destroyed,'' the father said. ``He has to live with this
the rest of his life.''
   Chad was described by his high school principal as ``your
everyday high school student.'' Counselors and nurses helped
distraught students at West Springfield High School cope with the
shooting.
   ``We are trying to help the students and the family get through
this crisis with as little scarring as possible,'' said Principal
George F. Bauman.

<HEAD>360,000 Truckers Could Lose Driving Privileges, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 360,000 truckers could lose their
driving privileges if states don't step up their plans to comply
with a new federal commercial driver's license law, congressional
investigators say.
   The General Accounting Office said Monday that 33 states may not
comply with a federal law that requires truck drivers to take tests
and obtain federally approved commercial driver's licenses by April
1, 1992. The law aims to get unsafe drivers off the road by
requiring them all to meet national standards.
   However, the Federal Highway Administration official overseeing
the program said the states are doing ``a terrific job'' and that
all plan to meet the deadline.
   A quirk in the law gives states until October 1993 to establish
testing and licensing programs, but the shorter deadline for
drivers to have the licenses makes it necessary to set up programs
18 months earlier.
   The commercial driver's license law was prompted by the 4,500
annual highway fatalities involving large trucks. Trucks account
for 4.5 percent of the traffic and 10 percent of the fatalities
nationwide.
   Before Congress passed the law, several states required only
ordinary driver's licenses for truckers and others had inconsistent
requirements, leading some drivers to go shopping for lenient
states.
   The GAO study, which assesses conditions as of October 1989 when
states were surveyed, said 13 states indicated they cannot meet the
April 1992 deadline.
   An additional 20 states plan to test and license between
one-fourth and one-half of their drivers in the final three months
before the deadline, which the study said probably is impossible.
   Jill Hochman, chief of the highway agency's standards review
division, said seven states already are issuing the new commercial
driver's licenses . They are Arizona, California, Maryland, New
Hampshire, Utah, Virginia and Washington. Michigan started but
temporarily suspended its program because of a computer problem,
she said.
   Twenty-seven other states plan to issue licenses before the end
of the year, Ms. Hochman said, and 10 states have not yet passed
commercial driver's license laws.
   Ms. Hochman said a limitation in the GAO report is that
conditions in a state can look different depending on which
official answers the survey.
   ``The states have been making terrific progress,'' she said.
``Nobody said it's going to be easy, but they all plan to meet the
deadline and I'm certainly not going to challenge their plans.''
   Most states plan to test and license all of their drivers over a
two-year period rather than the four years permitted in the
legislation that implemented the law, the GAO study said.
   GAO also said most states are having problems in making changes
in their driver's license computer systems so they can hook into a
national databank of information on all drivers.
   Ms. Hochman said the Federal Highway Administration has been
working with states to help them set up the computer system.
   GAO researcher Ron Wood said the 13 states that indicated they
could not meet the April 1992 deadline for all truckers to be
licensed are Arizona, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Rhode Island, Kentucky,
Wisconsin and Massachusetts.
   Wood said the 20 states that plan to issue an unusually large
share of licenses in the final three months before the deadline
are: California, Oregon, Illinois, Florida, Iowa, Alabama, Alaska,
Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and
Vermont.
   The 10 states that have not yet passed commercial driver's
license laws, according to the highway administration, are Alaska,
Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont and New York. The District of Columbia also
has yet to pass such a law.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Wants to Help `Bring Democracy to Haiti'</HEAD>

   The Bush administration says it stands ready
to help a provisional government ``bring democracy to Haiti'' after
hastening the departure of a deposed ruler for the second time in
four years.
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril flew out of Homestead Air Force Base near
Miami for an undisclosed refuge on Monday, barely seven hours after
a U.S. Air Force C-141 transport plane evacuated Avril and his
family from Port-au-Prince.
   With Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, the army chief of staff, expected
to turn authority over today to a civilian provisional president,
the administration urged ``all Haitians (to) work together in a
spirit of reconciliation'' to achieve free elections and respect
for human rights ``as rapidly as possible.''
   ``The United States shares these goals and is prepared to help
the provisional government bring democracy to Haiti,'' State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   A week of bloodshed that left at least 24 dead in the streets of
Haiti brought an end to Avril's 18-month rule in the Western
Hemisphere's poorest nation.
   Administration officials said Avril's downfall came after he
staged a crackdown in January that led to the arrest of some
opposition leaders and forced others into exile.
   ``This was just a tremendous error on Avril's part. All of
Haitian society ... (became) galvanized against him,'' said an
administration source who asked not to be identified. ``He just
became more and more isolated.''
   The White House said Avril requested U.S. help in leaving Haiti
during a weekend meeting with U.S. Ambassador Alvin P. Adams.
   ``We had discussions with him about the transition. ... (There)
was a feeling of some obligation to help him leave and facilitate a
peaceful transition,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   He said Avril was granted only ``a temporary sanctuary here.''
   An Air Force spokesman said Avril left Homestead by ``personally
arranged transportation'' but provided no other details.
   In February 1986, the United States dispatched another Air Force
jet to carry Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier into exile in
France, ending 29 years of dictatorship under the Duvaliers, father
and son.
   Avril, 52, chief of the Presidential Guard and a former Duvalier
adviser, declared himself president in September 1988. He foiled a
reported coup attempt last April and declared the state of siege
Jan. 20 after the mysterious slaying of an army colonel.
   ``We are hopeful for a smooth transition to democracy in Haiti
and are encouraging that effort,'' Fitzwater said.
   Haitians are scheduled to vote in local elections in April and
in presidential elections in October and November.
   The United States is providing $41.4 million in humanitarian and
development assistance to Haiti through private voluntary and
non-governmental agencies.
   It cut off $78 million in direct aid after the massacre of 34
voters in aborted elections Nov. 29, 1987. The United States did
provide $10 million in emergency food assistance to the
Port-au-Prince government last year.
   Fitzwater said the United States would have to see ``tangible
evidence of progress and a transition to democracy and to respect
for human rights'' before direct aid is resumed.

<HEAD>Rural Community Development Bill Up for House Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Decaying rural communities could look to a new
government office within the Agriculture Department for development
help if a bill up for a House vote this week becomes law.
   The measure would create a rural development administration for
programs currently carried out by the Farmers Home Administration,
such as water and sewer, business and industry, and loan and grant
programs for community facilities.
   Money now placed in three funds for each of those categories
could be pooled for one purpose, based on community needs.
   For example, if the big need were improved water and sewer
facilities, all the money could go for that. If the community had
adequate public works, the funds could be used to lure business and
industry.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who coauthored the bill with Rep.
Tom Coleman, R-Mo., said the idea is to give communities more power
and flexibility with existing federal money.
   The bill is scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. The Senate
passed a significantly different rural development bill last summer.
   Lawmakers believe some kind of development bill is needed to
save communities that are losing jobs and population because of the
decreasing number of farms around the country.
   Under the House bill, rural communities would have to prepare
local or regional economic plans that would be submitted to a state
review panel in order to get development money.
   The bill doesn't say exactly who should prepare the plans, but
it calls for participation by local government, business,
industrial, financial, transportation, utility, labor, agriculture
and educational institutions.
   The state review panel would then rank the applications for
projects, with special priority required for declared health
emergencies.
   Each state would get a grant of up to $100,000 to pay the costs
of the review panel.
   The bill also establishes a technical assistance unit within the
Rural Electrification Administration that would allow borrowers to
defer payment on certain loans for up to 10 years if the loan is
invested in rural development projects.
   Other key provisions include:
   _``Action teams'' to help communities dependent on forestry to
diversify.
   _A rural development information-gathering and dissemination
center to help communities exchange ideas for successful projects.
   _$50 million in each of the fiscal years 1991 through 1993 for
competitive grants to non-profit institutions that establish
centers for rural technology or development.
   _More help from the Agricultural Extension Service for business
development.
   _Grants from the Cooperative State Research Service for research
on non-food uses of agricultural commodities.
   The Bush administration objects to several provisions in the
bill, including the forest community ``action teams,'' the
deferring of REA loans and the establishment of state review
panels, which it says encroaches on the president's authority to
decide how federal development money should be spent.

   Animal rights activists who attack farms and
research labs to set animals free would be breaking federal law if
a bill being considered by the House Agriculture Committee is
enacted.
   ``We're talking about terrorism against farmers,'' Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, said during a recent hearing.
   Stenholm introduced a bill called the Farm Animal and Research
Facilities Protection Act last fall that has wide support in the
House.
   It sets penalties of up to three years in jail and $10,000 in
fines for anyone who damages or disrupts an enterprise involving
animals.
   The Bush administration's Office of Science and Technology
Policy says a federal law is needed because the research involving
use of animals ``is of immense value to the welfare of the citizens
of this country and the federal government must ensure that the
environment in which research is conducted, and the persons
pursuing such research, are free from threats of violence,
intimidation and debilitating distractions.''
   Paul Maloney of the Justice Department, however, said state laws
are sufficient for prosecuting the crimes committed by activists
who break into labs or farms to set animals free.
   In testimony before a House Agriculture subcommittee, local law
enforcement officers said a federal law is needed to make sure the
FBI uses its resources and authority to go after the groups that
operate nationally.

   A witness in the white-on-black slaying of a
teen-ager in the city's Bensonhurst section backed out of a deal
with prosecutors and decided to face murder charges rather than
testify against his friends.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said John Vento, 21,
who was being held in protective custody, changed his mind about
cooperating and was arrested Monday. He was ordered held for
arraignment on a charge of murder.
   Seven other young white men from Bensonhurst have been charged
in the slaying Aug. 23 of Yusuf Hawkins, a black 16-year-old who
was shot after he went with three friends into the mostly white
neighborhood to look at a used car.
   Hynes said he still has a ``trial ready'' case without Vento.
   However, a prosecutor speaking on condition of anonymity
characterized Vento's defection as ``a major blow.''
   ``He was in the middle of the group, and he was going to
testify,'' the prosecutor said.
   Vento, who admitted taking part in the attack, at first agreed
to testify against his friends in exchange for a pledge he would
not be charged.
   He disappeared in December but surrendered to the FBI in Dayton,
Ohio, last week after his absence forced a month's delay in the
start of the first trial. The defendants are being tried in groups.
   After meeting with the district attorney, Vento's lawyer, Gerald
DiChiara, said Monday that Vento ``has reasons I could not argue
against'' and ``is very concerned for everything _ his family,
himself.''
   The first trial is set for April 2.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's defense budget is an
``excessively cautious and inordinately expensive response'' to the
rapidly diminishing Soviet threat, a bipartisan group of U.S.
military experts said today.
   The administration's fiscal 1991 budget calls for full-scale
strategic modernization with procurement of the B-2 stealth bomber,
two land-based nuclear missile systems and the Strategic Defense
Initiative.
   But the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact requires a
restructuring of the U.S. military, starting with a reasonable goal
of a 50 percent reduction in defense spending by the year 2000, the
group said in a 27-page report.
   ``Changes in the world must be reflected in the defense budget,
and U.S. national security can be supported with a steady,
sustained decrease in defense budgets over the next 10 years,'' the
report said.
   The panel, headed by Lawrence J. Korb, a former assistant
secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, recommended
halting production of the B-2 bomber at 15 planes, canceling plans
to move the multiple-warhead MX from fixed silos to railroad cars
and limiting spending on SDI to no more than $3 billion a year.
   In its report, ``Restructuring the U.S. Military: Defense Needs
in the 21st Century,'' the panel also proposed that the United
States seek a ban on multiple-warhead, intercontinental ballistic
missiles, stop the purchase of Trident submarines at 17 and cancel
production of the C-17 cargo plane.
   The panel suggested cutting active forces Army divisions from 18
to 10, reducing the Navy's carrier battle groups from 14 to nine
and halving the Air Force's active tactical air wings from 24 to 12.
   It said the number of troops U.S. stationed in Europe should be
cut from the current 305,000 to about 100,000.
   Bush's $292 billion defense budget for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 calls for a nearly $1 billion increase in spending on SDI,
$5.5 billion for the B-2 bomber and more than $3 billion on the MX
and single-warhead Midgetman missiles.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said no major cuts in spending
or changes in defense strategy should be considered until new
U.S.-Soviet arms control treaties are completed.
   ``A good deal of prudence is in order,'' Cheney told Congress
last month.
   But the panel said the administration's ``proposals for only
slight reductions in defense programs and budgets over the next
five years reflect an excessively cautious and inordinately
excessive response to the changing security environment.''
   It proposed reductions in defense spending averaging 6.7 percent
annually for a 50 percent cut in the next decade. The current
budget is a 2 percent reduction from last year after adjusting for
inflation.
   The Defense Budget Task Force of the Committee for National
Security and the Defense Budget Project produced the report. The
committee and the project are independent, non-profit organizations.
   Members of the panel included former CIA Director William Colby,
retired Rear Adm. Stanley S. Fine, former Navy budget director; and
Paul Warnke, a former director of the Arms Control and Disarmament
Agency.

<HEAD>Soviets Minimize Importance of KGB Defector</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A KGB defector who recently surfaced after a
decade in hiding was a technician with ``no access to serious
secret information,'' a Soviet official says.
   Nevertheless, Sergey B. Chetverikov, minister-counselor at the
Soviet embassy, said Monday that he had lodged a ``strong protest''
about the case of Victor I. Sheymov at a meeting with Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   Chetverikov said the involvement of U.S. intelligence in
smuggling Sheymov, his wife, and his 5-year-old daughter out of the
Soviet Union in 1980 was a ``gross violation of rules of
international law, which is, in fact, an act of state terrorism.''
   The State Department had no immediate comment on the case.
   At a news conference, Chetverikov confirmed that Sheymov, 43,
``did indeed work at some point within the system of the Committee
for State Security,'' the full name of the KGB.
   He said Sheymov graduated from Bauman Technical School in Moscow
as a mechanical engineer and was employed by the KGB as a ``coding
equipment maintenance technician.''
   ``His responsibilities, however, allowed him no access to
serious secret information, including documents,'' the official
added.
   Chetverikov also complained about some of the allegations that
Sheymov made at a news conference March 2.
   Sheymov said he was present in the Warsaw station of the KGB in
1979 when a cable arrived from Moscow ordering what he believed to
be the initial stages of a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II.
   ``Totally untenable and malicious from beginning to end is his
assertion about the Committee for State Security's involvement in
the affair relating to the attempt on Pope John Paul II's life,''
Chetverikov said.
   He said CIA officials knew ``very well that the KGB had not and
could not have anything to do with this heinous crime.''
   Allegations have long circulated about possible Soviet
involvement in a plot to kill the pope after he was wounded by a
Turkish gunman in 1981. No connection with Moscow has ever been
firmly established, however.
   Chetverikov also said ``hints about the KGB's involvement in
organizing the attempt on the late President Zia ul Haq of Pakistan
can also be described as wild fiction.'' Zia was killed when his
plane blew up in 1988.
   Sheymov also said in the late 1970s the Soviet Union had two
sources inside the State Department able to deliver secret
information on U.S. policy and negotiating positions. The
department has refused to comment on that assertion.
   Chetverikov accused U.S. intelligence of promoting Sheymov to
undermine improved relations between the Soviet Union and the
United States.
   Those who brought Sheymov to the United States ``were directly
involved in the attempts to call attention to the Sheymov story
through mass media, in an apparent pursuit of the objectives which
run counter to the dynamic process of normalization of US-Soviet
relations emerging during the years of perestroika
(restructuring),'' he said.
   Sheymov said at his news conference that he was looking for a
publisher for a book he has written.
   Despite the protest, Chetverikov said he doubted Moscow would
retaliate in any way against the United States. ``I guess we are
beyond that stage,'' he said.
   The Soviet official also said he did not know where Sheymov
lived or what charges he would face in the Soviet Union if he ever
returned. Sheymov has become a U.S. citizen since his defection a
decade ago.

<HEAD>FAA Order Would Modify DC-10 Hydraulics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government wants airlines flying the DC-10
to make some changes in the plane's hydraulic system to avoid the
kind of crash that killed 112 people in Iowa last year.
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday tentatively issued
an ``airworthiness directive'' requiring modifications that the
agency said would enable pilots to steer the plane even if
hydraulic lines are severed in the plane's tail section.
   The order, which becomes final after a period for several weeks
for public comment, resulted from the July 19, 1989, crash of a
United Airlines DC-10 at the Sioux City, Iowa, airport where it was
making an emergency landing with 295 people aboard.
   Investigation into the crash continues, but pilots said they
lost hydraulic steering control after the plane's tail engine
exploded.
   The FAA order follows changes recommended in the airliner by its
manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   ``The change would preserve enough hydraulic fluid following
damage to the system to enable the flight crew to safely fly and
land the airplane,'' the FAA said. Airlines would have six months
to make the modifications in the 10-series of DC-10s and a year for
all other DC-10 models.
   Investigators into the Iowa crash have said they believe flying
debris from the explosive tail engine failure severed all three of
the jetliner's independent hydraulic systems that control flight.
   The FAA-ordered modification would require devices in the
hydraulic system to keep fluid from leaking out in the event the
lines in the tail section, where the hydraulic systems come the
closest together, are cut.
   With the change, the pilot would still lose control over the
rudder, which turns the airliner, and the elevators, which control
climb and descent. But other control surfaces, including the
ailerons, which make it possible to keep the wings level, would
remain operable, the FAA said.
   Crew members of the United plane said their only means of
steering the aircraft and controlling descent was to selectively
accelerate the remaining wing engines.
   The FAA earlier ordered an ultrasonic inspection of all DC-10
engine fan disks for a possible microscopic defect in the metal
that investigators said may have caused the engine failure.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
again Tuesday afternoon and registered the eighth-largest
single-day loss in its history, while the dollar was higher against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 747.66 points, or 2.24
percent, ending the day at 32,620.57. Added to Monday's
624.89-point loss, the Nikkei has lost 1,372.55 points in two days.
   The dollar was changing hands at 152.13 yen as of 3:00 p.m. (1
a.m. EST). It opened higher at 152.82 yen, up 0.82 yen from
Monday's close at 152.00 yen, and ranged between 151.95 yen and
152.88 yen during the afternoon session.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond
plunged to 86.15 points, down 0.34 points from Monday's close at
86.49. Its yield rose from the previous day's 7.24 percent to 7.31
percent by 3:00 p.m.
   Analysts blamed plunge in stock prices on the decline in the
Japanese yen and speculation that the Bank of Japan would raise key
interest rates.
   Market players have long expected the central bank to hike its
official discount rate, which now stands at 4.25 percent after
three increases last year.
   They say a hike of as much as 1 percent is likely to take place
as soon as Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno returns from a trip
to Europe Thursday.
   The Nikkei had fallen more than 540 points at midmorning in part
prompted by computer-aided selling by arbitrageurs, said Kazuhiro
Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities.
   Arbitrage is a tactic used to profit from the spread between the
spot and future markets. Large-scale, computer-aided arbitrage
selling has been blamed for the market's recent volatility.
   Last month the Tokyo Stock Exchange asked major securities firms
to refrain from arbitrage when the index is falling, but dealers
said many investors seemed to ignore the request.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of miners employed by the country's
largest copper company walked off the job demanding higher wages
and ignoring a no-strike agreement reached in September, company
and union officials said.
   A spokesman for the U.S.-owned Southern Peru Copper Corp. said
3,000 workers at the Cuajone mine in the southern Andes and the Ilo
refinery on the southern Pacific coast began striking Monday.
   The 2,500 workers at the company's Toquepala mine's continued to
work, said the spokesman, who commented on condition of anomymity.
   Reynaldo Fernandez, secretary general of the union at Ilo said
the Toquepala workers were considering whether to join the strike.
   Southern workers agreed in September not to strike for one year
in exchange for monthly bonuses, which at that time amounted to
about $200 a month.
   However Peru's hyperinflation, which last year reached nearly
3,000 percent, has cut the value of the monthly bonus to about $39
a month.
   The miners are now demanding the agreement be scrapped and for
monthly wages to be increased to $400, Fernandez said.
   Last year, Southern produced about 200,000 tons of copper,
two-thirds of the country's total output.

<TEXT>
   A Grumman Corp. official is the latest in
a series of individuals and defense contractors to plead guilty to
unlawfully obtaining and distributing classified Pentagon documents.
   Harry Kotellos, who pleaded guilty Monday to a felony conspiracy
count, faces a maximum penalty of $250,000 in fines and five years
in prison when he is sentenced May 18 for his actions from 1980
through 1985 as a senior marketing analyst for Grumman.
   The plea agreement submitted to U.S. District Judge Claude
Hilton is contingent on Kotellos' full cooperation in the probe
into the illegal trafficking in classified Defense Department
documents.
   ``Mr. Kotellos was a significant player in the tightly knit
group which acquired and distributed some very sensitive DOD
information,'' said Michael J. Costello, special agent in charge of
the Defense Criminal Investigative Service's Washington field
office. ``... We have attempted to reach the inner core of the
network and neutralize it.''
   The documents involved were those that summarize the resources
the Pentagon is planning to spend in future years, said Richard
Smith, Costello's assistant. The case also involved Air Force
budget documents, according to court papers.
   Kotellos, 53, is a West Point graduate and retired Air Force
lieutenant colonel who has worked for Grumman since 1980, said his
attorney, Plato Cacheris.
   Investigators would not say whether Grumman itself was under
investigation, but company spokesman Larry Hamilton said: ``Grumman
is engaged in discussions with the government as to the
consequences to the company of Mr. Kotellos' plea. Since this
matter continues to be under review, the company cannot comment on
these discussions.''
   The criminal investigative service has been conducting an
investigation _ code-named Operation Uncover_ since the mid-1980s
into illegal transfers of Pentagon documents to defense contractors.
   Four major defense contractors and several individuals have
pleaded guilty to been convicted of charges resulting from
Operation Uncover:
   _Hughes Aircraft Co. pleaded guilty last Friday and agreed to
pay a total of $3.67 million in fines and restitution.
   _GTE Government Systems Division pleaded guilty in 1985 and paid
about $300,000.
   _The Boeing Co. pleaded guilty last November and paid fines and
restitution of $5.2 million, and Boeing employee Richard Lee Fowler
was convicted last December of all counts of a 39-count indictment.
   _RCA Corp. pleaded guilty and was ordered Feb. 5 to pay fines
and restitution of $2.75 million. Former RCA employee Leonard Kampf
and current RCA employee Ronald Stevens each pleaded guilty to one
felony count and face sentencing April 6.
   The conspiracy count against Kotellos said he acquired
classified documents from a government employee who was not
authorized to release them; getting classified documents from
Fowler of Boeing; sharing classified documents with other defense
contractors and obtaining such documents from them; and destroying
some of the documents in his fireplace at home.
   Court papers did not identify the government employee. Smith
declined to reveal the name or to say whether that person was under
investigation.
   A source close to the investigation said he believed prosecutors
``may have a problem with the statute of limitations'' in the case
against the government employee because of a lack of information of
wrongdoing after 1984.
   But Smith said: ``In a continuing conspiracy, the last overt act

   The 1985 actions enabled prosecutors to go after Kotellos, Smith

   Kotellos was placed on administrative leave with pay from his
job Monday morning, Grumman's Hamilton said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is the city that says it knows how,
the one where tourists love to leave their hearts.
   But while most of the physical damage from the Oct. 17
earthquake has been repaired, community leaders are not sure how to
fix the damage done to San Francisco's reputation for warm if
eccentric hospitality.
   From cable cars to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf hotels to
theaters and museums, commercial and cultural business has been
reported way down since the quake.
   That may be changing, thanks to time and fading memories,
promotions, ad campaigns and a realization by the business
community that it must also deal with skyrocketing air fares,
recession fears and increasing competition.
   ``The earthquake is a very good excuse for everything,'' said
John Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors'
Bureau. ``But there are many other factors that are causing the
momentary bump'' in tourism.
   Many tourist-oriented cities across the country are experiencing
similar sluggishness, he said.
   The Visitors' Bureau is spending more on national advertising
this year than ever before. Its budget is $1 million, up $400,000,
Marks said.
   ``We believe that time is our greatest ally, and the more time
that expires after Oct. 17, the less likely the impact of the quake
is going to affect the decision of the traveler,'' said Marks.
   Helping to influence those decisions are discount room rates.
The Mark Hopkins, for example, is offering $205 rooms for $99. At
The Ramada at Fisherman's Wharf, rooms are $59 rather than the
standard $120.
   While San Francisco hotel occupancy rates stood at about 70
percent last year, the break-even point for the average hotel, they
dropped by as much as 10 percent in the first two months of 1990.
   ``I can't decide which is the greatest problem _ concern about
the economy or about another earthquake,'' said Oscar Vahidi,
general manager of the Ramada.
   Adding to the problem of earthquake-queasy tourists, the city
saw a 7 percent growth in hotel rooms last year, and 1,400 more
rooms are scheduled to come on the market around the end of the
year.
   Near the wharf, Kathy Paver, spokeswoman for the Pier 39 complex
of boutiques and restaurants, said business is comparable to that
of the same time last year. Hundreds of hungry and lovesick sea
lions frolicking in the bay, feasting on tourists' handouts, have
generated even bigger crowds, she said.
   But at The Cannery nearby, spokesman Chris Martin said business
is off as much as 20 percent at some shops and restaurants. ``I
don't think they're going to be back to normal until the
double-deck freeways that are out of commission are back on
track,'' he said.
   The California Transportation Department said the quake-damaged
Embarcadero Freeway _ which took an average of 80,000 cars daily
from the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to the Financial
District, Chinatown and the wharf _ could be back in operation by
September.
   ``Part of the problem is people just don't know how to get
around the city,'' Martin said.
   Even the romantic cable car is in a slump. Municipal Railway
spokesman George Newkirk said average daily ridership before
October was 11,000 to 13,000. Today, 8,000 to 10,000 take the $2
rides on the rolling landmarks, he said.
   Businesses are preparing a celebration April 10-22 featuring
dedication of a restored cable car, a parade, an Easter egg hunt at
Fisherman's Wharf, a merchants' fair and an Earth Day extravaganza.
   A campaign by the California Arts Council is raising money for
art organizations hurt by the quake, which killed 67 people,
injured thousands and caused about $10 billion in damage.
   At San Francisco's American Conservatory Theater, the nation's
largest regional theater company with about 200 employees,
spokeswoman Carla Befera said attendance has been down 40 percent
since the company's Geary Street theater was closed for quake
repairs. Plays have been performed at other theaters.
   ``When you're moved out to the center of the Financial District
... it really affects your sales,'' she said.
   ACT, which needs about $14 million overall to handle repairs and
seismic upgrading, hopes to move back to the Geary in the middle of
the 1991-92 season. ``So the rest of this season, we live as
gypsies,'' Befera said.
   San Francisco Museum Society director Harry Parker said
attendance slipped at one point to about half the normal 50,000
visitors per month. He said attendance appears to be picking up.
   But whatever the financial or physical costs, a survey of 300
area residents commissioned by Japanese groups developing
earthquake reaction plans for their nation about a month after the
quake showed only 7 percent considered moving.
   ``It's like this is a fact of life, and the benefits of living
in California outweigh the fear of even more devastating
earthquakes,'' said Polly Smith of Plog Research Inc.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sponsors of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival
say they hope unseasonably warm weather hitting the nation's
capital will not cause the trees to bloom too early for the
celebration.
   ``Even though the weather forecasts are good _ drat it _ and the
cherry blossoms look like they may come out early, we're still
hopeful,'' National Park Service spokesman Al Dale said.
   April 1 is the scheduled start of the 78th annual festival
commemorating the gift of the 3,000 trees to the United States by
the mayor of Tokyo in 1912. Temperatures ranging from the mid 60s
to the upper 80s are expected for the rest of the week.
   The earliest the trees have ever blossomed was March 20, but
forecasters say it could be even earlier this year _ probably March
15. The delicate pink and white blossoms last four to five days
after they peak.
   ``If things go according to our estimates, by April 1, the
program may just be the Japanese Tree Festival, because the
blossoms will have come and gone,'' National Weather Service
meteorologist Jim Belleville said.

<HEAD>FAA Inspectors Not Trained to Stop Drinking Pilots, Congressman</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Says
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some inexperienced Federal Aviation
Administration inspectors don't have the training to prevent
intoxicated crews from flying airliners, says the chairman of the
House aviation subcommittee.
   An FAA inspector in Fargo, N.D., allowed a Northwest Airlines
jet to take off last Thursday despite a tip that the crew had been
drinking for more than six hours.
   ``The system could fail again the same way,'' Rep. Jim Oberstar,
D-Minn., said Monday after meeting with FAA Administrator James
Busey.
   Busey told Oberstar that ``he was going to get their
(inspectors) training upgraded to deal with situations like that,''
said FAA spokeswoman JoAnn Sloane.
   Sloane could not provide any details of how the inspectors
training would be improved.
   ``The FAA is going to act on this quickly or we're going to burn
their behind,'' Oberstar said.
   The three crew members on the flight from Fargo to Minneapolis
were arrested upon landing last Thursday when blood tests showed
excessive alcohol levels. Their licenses were revoked.
   The Fargo inspector didn't detain the crew members because they
didn't smell of alcohol and didn't appear to be impaired, said
Oberstar. The inspector interviewed the men and observed them for
more than an hour while they prepared for departure, Oberstar said.
   The FAA had said that the Fargo inspector did not have the
authority to stop the plane from taking off under North Dakota law
and that the tip didn't constitute evidence of intoxication.
   However, Oberstar said Northwest or any other airline would have
voluntarily grounded the flight had it been warned of the
allegations.

<HEAD>Soviets Got $481 Million in U.S. Wheat Subsidy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. subsidies on wheat sold to the Soviet
Union totaled $481 million over a 29-month period, according to a
General Accounting Office report.
   The subsidies are collected by U.S. exporting companies, which
then ship to the Soviets and other foreign buyers at less than
market prices.
   The object is to help U.S. farm products compete with growers in
other countries whose exports receive government subsidies. The
program is aimed especially at competition from the 12 countries of
the European Economic Community, where France and West Germany are
big exporters of wheat.
   Detailed figures in the report, made available recently, cover
Oct. 1, 1986, through Feb. 28, 1989. During that period, the total
subsidies to all exporters amounted to $2.3 billion. Total sales of
U.S. products helped by the subsidies were $6.8 billion, of which
$5.5 billion was for sales of wheat.
   Five countries were the biggest wheat buyers under the program:
the Soviet Union, China, Algeria, Egypt and Morocco.
   Critics say the subsidized sales discourage those governments
from paying better prices to their own farmers, and that the bread
from the wheat is so cheap that some feed it to animals.

<HEAD>NYNEX Asks FCC To Dismiss Record Fines and Refunds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NYNEX Corp. has asked the Federal
Communications Commission to throw out more than $36 million in
fines and refunds to be paid by two subsidiaries because they did
not pass along to ratepayers the inflated cost of equipment.
   In legal papers filed Monday, NYNEX said telephone ratepayers
were not overcharged as a result of transactions between Materiel
Enterprises Co., an unregulated NYNEX affiliate, and New York
Telephone Co. and New England Telephone and Telegraph Co.
   Last month, the FCC levied fines totaling $1.4 million against
New York Telephone Co. and New England Telephone and Telegraph Co.
and ordered them to refund about $35 million to customers.
   The fines were the largest federal penalty ever imposed on a
telephone company and involved alleged $118.5 million in
overcharges made to the two subsidiaries by Material Enterprises
Co., which was established in 1983 to provide equipment and
services to the two phone companies.

<HEAD>`Red October' Continues to Lead at Box Office; `House Party'
Strong</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Hunt for Red October'' stayed afloat at
No. 1 at the box office, and the new low-budget comedy ``House
Party'' made big money.
   ``Red October,'' the Sean Connery-Alec Baldwin submarine
thriller, sold $14.1 million in tickets at the nation's theaters
over the weekend, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   In second place was the new romantic comedy ``Joe vs. the
Volcano,'' pairing Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in a story of a man on
one last, fiery fling. The film collected $9.3 million in its debut
weekend.
   ``House Party,'' a new comedy released by New Line Cinema,
makers of the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' slasher films, netted
$4.6 million for third, even though it is playing only in limited
release on 520 screens.
   Rob Lowe, returning to Hollywood after several ill-famed
homemade videos, finished in fourth with ``Bad Influence.'' The
drama had ticket sales of $3.8 million.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' director Oliver Stone won the top
prize from the Directors Guild of America on Saturday, but the film
continued to fade at the box office. It finished eighth with a take
of $1.5 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``The Hunt for Red October,'' Paramount, $14.1 million, 1,665
screens, $8,444 per screen, $37.7 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Joe vs. the Volcano,'' Warner Bros., $9.3 million, 1,802
screens, $5,134 per screen, $9.3 million, one week.
   3. ``House Party,'' New Line, $4.6 million, 520 screens, $8,867
per screen, $4.6 million, one week.
   4. ``Bad Influence,'' Epic, $3.8 million, 1,297 screens, $2,946

<HEAD>City to Pay Estates of Children Killed in MOVE Confrontation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city has agreed to pay $500,000 to the
estates of each of five children who died after police bombed the
radical group MOVE's headquarters five years ago.
   The settlement, approved by a federal judge Feb. 28, was
confirmed Monday by Charisse R. Lillie, city solicitor under Mayor
W. Wilson Goode.
   Five children and six adult MOVE members were killed in 1985
during the battle between MOVE and police officers trying to arrest
members of the armed, back-to-nature group. Police dropped a bomb
on MOVE's fortified home, setting off a fire that destroyed 61 row
houses.
   The children, whose bodies were pulled from the rubble, ranged
in age from 9 to 14. One or both parents of each child were
imprisoned for their MOVE activities.
   Jim Beasley, an attorney for the children's estates, said the
city could not have defended its case in court.
   ``There was just no way that anyone was going to come into a
courtroom and explain to a jury that this is something that should
have happened or was anticipated in happening and could be
justified,'' he said.
   The settlement brings to at least $25 million the estimated cost
to the city of the MOVE disaster, including rebuilding of the homes.
   Ten cases stemming from the confrontation are still pending,
including one filed by the family of Michael Ward, a boy who
survived the bombing.

<HEAD>Teams Vote to Keep Football Replay Officials, With Reservations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pro football voted to continue allowing
referees to check disputed calls against the instant replay, but
allowed the judges only two minutes to watch a tape and barred them
from listening to TV sportscasters.
   Twenty-one of the 28 National Football League teams Monday
approved the use of replays for another year.
   The replays began on a trial basis for the 1986-87 season and
have been voted on each year since. The procedure allows referees
to request a review of the videotape on plays where a call from the
field may have been in error.
   Many teams expressed unhappiness over the delays caused by the
replays. According to NFL figures, the delays averaged 1 minute, 55
seconds, although some reviews took four or five minutes.
   Next year, if a play isn't overturned in two minutes, it is
assumed to stand.
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue overcame resistance to renewing
replay by also agreeing to ensure that replay officials won't hear
the opinion of TV commentators while using network tape in
reviewing plays.
   Tagliabue said he didn't become an ardent supporter of replay
until Saturday, when he watched tapes of the 65 plays overturned by
replay last season.
   ``What I saw were 65 errors that were rectified,'' he said.
``Any time you're able to rectify a mistake, I think you should do
it.''
   Voting against replay were Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City,
Phoenix, Chicago, Tampa Bay and the New York Giants.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday fired
Vice Premier Shimon Peres, collapsing the 15-month coalition
government in a dispute over starting peace talks with
Palestinians, Israel army radio said.
   The rest of the Cabinet ministers from Peres' center-left Labor
Party resigned after Shamir, leader of the rival Likud bloc,
dismissed Peres as finance minister.
   On Monday, Peres won the approval of the Labor Party's Central
Committee to bring down the government after accusing Shamir of
leading Israel into ``the desert of indecision'' about peace talks
with Palestinians.
   Shamir spokesman Yossi Achimier said on army radio Tuesday that
the prime minister was now turning his attention to surviving a
no-confidence vote in Parliament on the motion Labor is expected to
file on Thursday.
   If successful, Shamir's conservative Likud bloc would be able to
rule without Labor.
   With the governing coalition broken up, elections are likely.
The last two elections were indecisive and tenuous Likud-Labor
coalitions resulted.
   The government crisis began last month when Labor demanded the
Cabinet approve proposals by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
that had been under consideration since October.
   On Sunday, Shamir refused to allow the decision-making Inner
Cabinet to vote on the plan, which involves arranging preliminary
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo.
   Labor supports the Baker proposals, but Likud says the provision
for including residents of Arab east Jerusalem in the talks could
threaten Israel's declared sovereignty over the area.
   Likud also opposes participation by exiled Palestinians on
grounds that could provide an opening to the talks for the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel views as a
terrorist organization.
   The Israel-Palestinian talks are meant to lead to eventual
elections in the Israeli-occupied territories, with their final
status decided later.
   Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in
the 1967 Middle East war.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wave of arbitrage selling set off the
fourth-largest decline this year in the Tokyo Stock Exchange's
chief index today, while the Japanese yen fell to its lowest level
against the dollar in Tokyo in exactly three years, traders said.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average dropped 747.66 points, or
2.24 percent, ending the day at 32,620.57, its lowest level since
March 28, 1989, when it closed at 32,306.36.
   Following a combined decline of 1,372.55 points today and
Monday, the Nikkei index has lost nearly 6,300 points, or 16.2
percent, since the beginning of this year.
   The dollar closed at 152.67 yen, up 0.67 yen from Monday's
152.00-yen finish. After opening higher at 152.82 yen, it ranged
between 151.95 and 152.88 yen during the day.
   Dealers said the yen's weakness and a plunge in Japanese
government bond prices led to massive arbitrage selling that in
turn contributed to the Nikkei's eighth-largest single-day loss in
history.
   The yen's weakness discouraged bond investors and caused the
price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds to plunge to
86.06 points, down 0.43 points from Monday's close of 86.49,
dealers said. The yield rose from the previous day's 7.24 percent
to 7.324 percent, the highest level in five years.
   ``Share prices kept falling in the afternoon as the dollar
remained above the 152-yen level,'' said Yasumasa Shinagawa, a
dealer with Yamaichi Securities Co. ``Participants discarded issues
while nobody bought them back.''
   Shinagawa said arbitrage trading, in which participants profit
from price gaps between the spot and the futures markets,
accelerated the Nikkei's plunge in afternoon trading.
   Analysts have blamed computer-aided large-scale arbitrage
trading for recent market plunges. They say such trading can
control the market direction, especially when overall volume is low.
   Today only 400 million shares traded hands on the market's first
section, up slightly from Monday's 370 million.
   Other dealers said persistent speculation over a hike in the
official discount rate hike also contributed to the plunge.
   Japanese financial markets have been fluctuating nervously in
recent weeks because a hike in the central bank's key interest rate
that was expected after last month's general election has not
materialized.
   Now investors expect the hike _ of as much as 1 percentage
point, according to local news reports _ to take place as soon as
Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno returns from a trip to Europe
on Thursday, dealers said.
   The official discount rate now stands at 4.25 percent after
three hikes last year.
   Local news reports today said Mieno hinted at the possibility of
an imminent hike in the nation's key lending rate to commercial
banks.
   The dollar opened higher in Tokyo following an overnight upswing
on overseas markets, and then weakened marginally in the morning
after intervention by the Bank of Japan, traders said. But the
dollar rose back in the afternoon session as market players bought
the U.S. currency, said a trader with Mitsui Bank, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the dollar would have risen higher without the Bank of
Japan's intervention.
   It was the dollar's highest finish in Tokyo since March 13,
1987, when it closed at 153.48 yen.
   Traders said the central bank sold at least 1 billion yen ($6.6
million) in an effort to stem the dollar's rise against the yen.

<HEAD>Mongolian Communists Meet To Discuss New Shape Of Leadership</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist leaders met today to
debate the shape of a new government for this longtime Soviet
client state, and a spokesman said reformers were winning over the
few remaining conservative opponents.
   Before resigning Monday, the Politburo of the ruling Communist
Party agreed to abolish the party's constitutional guarantee on
power, hold a special party congress to choose a new leadership and
hold early elections this year for a new legislature to rewrite the
constitution.
   ``It is a crucial moment for the party,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tepbishiin Chimeddorj said today.
   He said today's special meeting of the party's 120-member
Central Committee could produce a new Politburo and even change its
structure and name.
   He said it was too early to give details of the form the new
leadership of the world's second-oldest Communist country would
take. The sparsely populated pastoral country of 2 million people
lies between the Soviet Union and China.
   Chimeddorj said Central Committee members, meeting for a second
day, had been arguing behind closed doors about the reform
proposals and ``practically nobody'' opposed them.
   ``In general, we can say in the Central Committee there are
radicals and conservatives. They are arguing, but the viewpoints of
the conservatives also are changing,'' he said.
   Mongolian officials did not rule out the possibility that the
officials who tendered their resignations Monday might be
re-elected.
   Party General Secretary Jambyn Batmonh and the four other
members of the Politburo resigned Monday, but he remains chairman
of the Parliament and head of state. His government titles were not
affected by Monday's announcement.
   Members of Mongolia's fledgling opposition said the Politburo
moves were only a first step toward democracy. Since the beginning
of the year, opposition demonstrations have pushed Mongolia's
sleepy reform process into high gear.
   ``A political struggle has started, and it is only the first
victory, said Batsukh (single name is cq), an activist in the New
Progressive movement.
   The movement today announced formation of a new wing, the
National Progressive Party, to join two earlier established
opposition parties _ the Democratic Party and the Social Democratic
Party.
   The National Progressive Party's leaders said they differ from
the other two opposition groups mainly in their demand for an
immediate transformation of Mongolia's centralized economy into a
market economy.
   Opposition parties are pressing for legislative elections to be
held in June or July.
   Mongolia in the early 1920s was the original Soviet satellite
and has borrowed heavily from Soviet experience and popular culture.
   Drab Soviet-style apartment buildings dot the capital, people
drive Soviet-built cars past traffic police dressed in Soviet-style
uniforms and, just as in Mongolia's northern neighbor, buyers queue
up to make purchases.
   Until recently, a statue of Stalin stood along one of the
capital's main streets, a monument to the Soviet leader Mongolians
revered for helping them fight Japanese invaders.
   But the reforms Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev unleashed
on Eastern Europe have had an effect in Mongolia, as well. There is
a new emphasis on learning languages other than Russian and the
country gradually has begun opening to the outside world.
   In Washington, the State Department on Monday welcomed the
Mongolian government's opening to opposition demands.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler pointed to the
Mongolian opposition movement that surfaced in recent months and
mounted peaceful rallies for democracy.
   The Central Committee on Monday set a special party congress for
April 10, at which a new Central Committee will be chosen. Batmonh
said the new group should be younger and in favor of reform.
   He called for early legislative elections, but did not specify a
date.
   One of the tasks of the new Parliament will be to approve a new
constitution, and work on the draft has started. One of the goals
of the new constitution will be to separate the roles of party and
government.
   Batmonh also called for renewed efforts to rehabilitate people
wrongly punished in past political purges.

<HEAD>Judge Indicates Ruling Against UPI in Photo Exchange Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge said he was inclined to let
Reuters end its picture exchange agreement with United Press
International.
   A decision was expected today.
   Judge Peter K. Leisure on Monday was weighing a request from UPI
for a preliminary injunction barring Reuters from pulling out of
the agreement.
   Reuters has said the agreement is not meeting its expectations;
UPI maintained that allowing Reuters to pull out would cause UPI
irreparable harm.
   The agreement, reached in 1984, called for UPI to supply Reuters
with pictures from the United States, while Reuters provided UPI
with pictures from other countries. It was to run for 10 years
beginning in 1985.
   After more than two hours of oral arguments Monday, Leisure said
he was prepared to rule against UPI in the dispute between the two
news services.
   But UPI's lawyers asked that Dr. Earl Brian, UPI chairman, be
allowed to testify on the impact of such a ruling.
   After Brian testified, the judge said he would issue his ruling
today.
   Brian said that after Reuters announced Feb. 16 that it was
canceling the contract and interrupted the exchange for four hours,
UPI began negotiations for a photo exchange with the French news
service Agence France-Presse.
   ``We were unable to reach any agreement save the supply of
photographs by AFP for three months,'' Brian said. ``We have not
accepted it.''
   He said a survey of 36 of UPI's major clients revealed that some
newspapers said they would drop the UPI photo service if the
Reuters canceled. Brian said a loss of foreign photos also could
result in clients dropping UPI's news service.
   If the injunction is not granted, Brian said, UPI will go
forward with its negotiations with AFP.
   After Brian's testimony, Leisure extended a temporary
restraining order that bars Reuters from canceling the contract
until next Monday ``to enable UPI lawyers to make whatever
applications are needed'' to an appeals court.
   UPI lawyer Mitchell Karlan said UPI would appeal if Leisure
denied the injunction.

   After 52 years of separation, Joseph and
Elizabeth Pipkin are ready to tie the knot again.
   They originally wed in 1932 in Oklahoma, but the marriage ended
after six years and two children, and they went their separate ways
_ she to Illinois, he to Oregon.
   ``We were just too young,'' said Mrs. Pipkin.
   That won't be a problem this time. Both were 77 when they took
their vows again Saturday, although in Pipkin's view, there's still
plenty of time.
   ``My dad married at 78,'' he said. ``He lived to 105.''
   Their daughter, Evelyn Pipkin, kept in touch with her father
through the years and toiled to bring the couple back together.
   ``He never did get over her,'' Evelyn Pipkin said. ``I always
had the feeling he loved her, even when he married my stepmother.
He never had any more children.''
   When Mrs. Pipkin's third husband died last winter, Evelyn
suggested her parents get together for old times' sake.
   A Christmas card from Mrs. Pipkin led to long letters and phone
calls. On Monday, they were married at the Assembly of God Church
in nearby Meadowbrook.

   A government watchdog group surprised
officials by inviting people who don't normally get the red carpet
treatment to a public reception and dance put on for lawmakers.
   William Hauda, executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin,
said Monday he distributed 2,000 fliers announcing the event to
senior citizen centers, homeless shelters and fraternity houses.
   ``I'm sure our lawmakers will benefit immensely from this
contact with homeless, hungry and needy citizens,'' Hauda said.
   Under state ethics law, lawmakers and state officials are
prohibited from accepting anything of value, including food and
drink, unless the same is offered to the general public. A notice
of the event was published in the classified section of Madison
newspapers.
   ``We felt that the tiny notice ... wasn't sufficient notice,''
Hauda said. ``We thought that we should help get the word out.''
   Superior Mayor Herb Bergson, who is hosting the do, said he was
angry Common Cause did not tell him about the fliers. ``I didn't
find out until late afternoon, so we couldn't get more food,'' he
said.
   But Jeff Wendorf, a university extension employee who helped
plan the event, said the additional guests were welcome.
   ``We come down here to share the hospitality of northern
Wisconsin, and will do just that,'' Wendorf said. ``When the food
runs out, it runs out. It's first come, first served.''

<HEAD>Boston's 10-Year `Big Dig' Gets Under Way</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The digging is under way on the Big Dig, a 10-year
project to cut another tunnel under Boston Harbor and replace the
city's elevated highway with an underground one.
   Groundbreaking was held Monday on the $4.4 billion project,
without which officials say Boston could someday develop 14-hour
gridlock.
   Because of the construction, however, traffic will get much
worse before it gets any better, and the demolition work may
unleash an onslaught of rats.
   Under the plan, a third tunnel will be built under the harbor
and the more than 30-year-old Central Artery, the rusty, six-lane
elevated highway through the city, will be replaced with an 8- to
10-lane underground expressway.
   The project underwent two years of planning, drafting and
approvals. If all goes according to plan, it will be complete in
1998.
   Rodents washed over the city's South End in 1984 during
construction on an expressway. In an effort to avert a similar
assault, the state has undertaken an anti-rat plan, including early
baiting and inspection aimed at controlling the millions of rats
whose habitats will be destroyed by the project.

   Summer-like weather continued throughout much of the eastern
United States today, but in parts of the West snow was a reminder
that it still is March.
   The National Weather Service said temperatures up to 25 degrees
above normal could be expected in much of the East through midweek.
   Temperatures overnight never dipped below the 50s in much of the
northern central United States. On Monday, record highs were set in
nearly 100 cities _ up to 95 in Baltimore, 19 degrees above the
city's century-old record for the date.
   Other record highs broken or tied for the date included Augusta,
Ga., 88; Chicago 81; Detroit 75; Kansas City 77; and Minneapolis 69.
   But the warm air flowing over snow and frozen ground created
dense fog from North Dakota into Michigan.
   Flooding caused by a combination of rain, rapidly melting snow
and frozen ground subsided by early today in Wisconsin and
Minnesota. Flooding also eased in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas,
which were hit by violent storms during the weekend.
   In the West, snow fell this morning in Great Falls, Mont. On
Monday, heavy snow closed Interstate 80 in the Lake Tahoe area of
Nevada because of many accidents.
   Snowfall of up to 2 to 4 inches also was reported Monday in
Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Utah and Arizona.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over east central
California, while rain was scattered over North Dakota and
Minnesota.
   Rain also reached from northeast New York state across the
central coast of New England, while rainshowers and thunderstorms
extended from the upper half of the Texas Gulf Coast across
southeast Texas and southern Louisiana.
   Galveston, Texas, reported one and one-third inches of rain

<HEAD>Allstate Will Sue to Block N.J. Insurance Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MARTELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allstate Insurance Co. threatened a court
challenge moments after Gov. Jim Florio signed a law to lower auto
premiums by 20 percent for New Jersey motorists, who pay the
second-highest rates in the nation.
   ``This will strike a blow for the working people who have been
oppressed by this unfair tax we call auto insurance,'' the governor
said Monday.
   Florio promised that the auto insurance reform package, which
moved through the Legislature and back to his desk within 45 days
of its unveiling by the new governor, will save motorists $222 a
car by next March.
   Florio's bill cuts auto insurance bills by eliminating the Joint
Underwriting Association, a state-operated pool for high-risk
drivers that has piled up a $3.1 billion debt. A $222-per-car
annual fee charged every motorist to keep the pool from bankruptcy
will be dropped.
   The law requires the insurance industry to pay $1.4 billion of
the JUA debt. Florio said that insurance companies, which at one
point had assigned more than half of New Jersey drivers to the JUA,
bilked the poorly operated pool and must now pay the money back.
The law bars insurers from charging higher premiums to make up the
cost of paying off the JUA debt.
   Insurers said, however, they are not to blame for the
state-created pool and promise to block the measure in court within
a month.
   ``We believe the bill is unconstitutional,'' said Allstate Vice
President Edward Young. ``It takes our stockholders' assets to pay
for a deficit we didn't create.''
   At an average of $1,000 per car, insurance rates in New Jersey
are second highest in the nation, behind Massachusetts, according
to a survey by A.M. Best Co., which rates the stability of
insurance companies.
   Young said Allstate will consider pulling out of New Jersey
because of the new law. ITT Hartford Insurance Group, which has a
very small part of the New Jersey market, also said it would stop
selling auto insurance for independent agents and brokers.
   Florio said New Jersey will ``adapt'' if insurers leave.
   ``This is a fair system for all, including the industry,'' he
said. ``For some of the companies to literally say they're going to
pick up their bat and ball and go play somewhere else is by
definition childish.''
   Under the law, the JUA will be replaced by a much smaller
assigned risk plan, motorists will pay higher registration fees and
professions that benefit from auto accidents _ doctors, lawyers and
body shops _ will pay $100 license fees to help pay the JUA debt.
   The insurance industry challenged, with some success, reforms in
California, where voters in 1988 passed an initiative rolling back
auto premiums 20 percent.
   Last week, California's insurance commissioner announced
premiums will be cut more than 20 percent in Los Angeles County,
where a third of Californians live, but will be raised in all but
two other counties.

   A plaster ceiling caved in and dropped two tons
of debris on customers at a croissant shop in the majestic Ansonia
Hotel, killing a woman and injuring 12 other people.
   Passersby and a homeless man who sells books on the sidewalk in
front of the ground floor shop helped pull out the survivors Monday.
   ``They were really good. The men got the women out first,'' said
police Officer Robert Schelhorn.
   ``We thought the building was falling,'' said Elvin Rodriguez, a
clerk at a nearby bookstore. ``First it was like a vibration, then
glass breaking _ and then a big boom.''
   The sidewalk bookseller, Benjamin Montalvo, was ``pulling a lot
of people out. He went in a couple of times,'' Rodriguez said.
   None of the injuries were considered life threatening.
   Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan said the collapsed area
was 250 square feet and weighed about two tons.
   The plaster ceiling in the ornate Beaux-Art building had been
covered with a suspended ceiling and the combined weight apparently
caused the collapse, Mulligan said.
   ``It's an old ceiling _ decorative molding, heavy plaster with
metal leaves holding it all together _ it just gave way,'' said
Buildings Commissioner Charles Smith.
   The Ansonia, a 17-story residential building built in 1904,
occupies a full city block on Broadway.
   In earlier years its residents included Enrico Caruso, Arturo
Toscanini, Lily Pons, Florenz Ziegfeld, Theodore Dreiser, Sol
Hurok, Igor Stravinsky and other celebrities. Arts figures favored
the hotel because its heavy construction made it soundproof.
   More recently the Ansonia has witnessed bitter landlord-tenant
squabbles. In 1988 its owners were fined $400,000 for illegal
removal of asbestos.

<HEAD>Paul McCartney Gives A Quarter Million to Fight Cancer, Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney, who on Wednesday
closes out his first tour of Japan in 24 years, has donated
$250,000 to fight cancer and help clean up the earth.
   Half of the funds will go to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York and the other half to the Japanese chapter of
the environmental group Friends of the Earth, tour publicist Fiona
Hurry said today.
   ``As we all know, cancer causes great suffering, and I have
great respect for all those who try to lessen the pain as best they
can,'' McCartney said in a statement. ``I also have hope that one
day science and medicine will find a way to beat cancer forever.''
   The 47-year-old rock'n'roller has been using his world tour,
which began in Oslo in September, as a platform to promote the
activities of Friends of the Earth.
   ``When I was a boy, I would never have believed it if someone
had told me that one day we'd have a hole in the sky _ in the ozone
layer _ that there would be acid in our rain, that the seas
wouldn't be clean enough to swim in and the air not fit enough to
breathe,'' McCartney said.
   ``All I am trying to do on this world tour is to hopefully make
people think about how we're wrecking this world and ask them to
challenge their politicians to act,'' he said.
   It was the first time McCartney has toured Japan since he
performed with the Beatles in 1966. A planned Japan tour in 1980
was derailed when the singer was arrested at Tokyo's airport for
possession of marijuana and later deported.
   His current band, which includes his wife Linda on keyboards and
percussion, today played the last of six concerts at the Tokyo
Dome, an indoor baseball stadium.
   His show features elaborate light and laser effects, more than a
dozen Beatle hits including ``Hey Jude,'' ``Let it Be'' and ``Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' and several cuts from
McCartney's latest album, ``Flowers in the Dirt.''
   The tour will travel to the United States, Brazil, and back to
Europe, where it is to end in April.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
today morning in thin, cautious European trading. Gold prices were
lower, fueled by the dollar's continued strength, traders said.
   ``The market is fundamentally pro-dollar, but the market is
cautious because of possible central bank intervention,'' said one
trader with a foreign bank in Milan, Italy.
   Dealer said many traders were on the sidelines waiting for the
scheduled release of U.S. retail sales figures later today. If the
figures show the U.S. economy is not slowing as much as economists
believe it is, the dollar could move higher, dealers said.
   Uncertainty about the German mark prior to Sunday's East German
elections, relatively low Japanese interest rates, and worries
about political instability in Japan have made the dollar a safe
haven currency, they said.
   ``There is a fundamental weakening of the yen,'' said Tim
Potter, a senior dealer at Goldman Sachs in London.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.67 yen to a closing 152.67 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 152.75 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.7147 West German marks, up from 1.7110
   _ 1.5270 Swiss francs, up from 1.5235
   _ 5.7965 French francs, up from 5.7800
   _ 1.9275 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9190
   _ 1,266.05 Italian lire, up from 1,263.75
   _ 1.1795 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1787
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound and was
quoted at $1.6012, compared with $1.6100 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $398.50 a troy ounce,
down from $400.65 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $397.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $397.50, down from $401.10 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.94 to close at a bid $399.08.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.05 a troy ounce, from
Monday's $5.13.

<TEXT>
   The state asked the corporate sponsor of
an exhibit on the Holocaust to delete references to homosexuals
from educational materials accompanying the exhibit.
   The materials, including an article on the repression of
homosexuals by Nazis, were prepared by Orem-based Geneva Steel for
teachers planning field trips to the exhibit, ``The World of Ann
Frank 1929-1945,'' to open here March 25.
   Utah school board guidelines state the ``acceptance of or
advocacy of homosexuality as a desirable or acceptable sexual
adjustment or lifestyle'' may not be taught in Utah.
   Geneva Steel removed the article on homosexuals at the urging of
school board officials, said Geneva employee Kathy Bryson.
   ``We were specifically told never to mention the homosexuals,''
she said.
   School Superintendent James Moss on Monday authorized Geneva
Steel to restore the deleted article, saying his intention earlier
had been misunderstood.
   But he said there would be a ``question in a teacher's mind of
sensitivity to state rules and laws ... and that any material
dealing with homosexuality would need to be approached very
carefully by teachers to ensure that they conform to those
guidelines.''
   The deleted article includes two pages detailing the treatment
of homosexuals after Adolf Hitler's rise to power in 1933.
Homosexuals were rounded up and sent to concentration camps where
they were castrated or exterminated.
   A third page shows a pink triangle, the symbol the Nazis forced
homosexuals to wear, surrounded by the words ``Gays Against
Facism.'' It contains a brief history of the adoption of the symbol
by the gay liberation movement in the 1970s.
   Michele Parish-Pixler of the American Civil Liberties Union said
Moss had waffled on the issue, leaving teachers unsure where they
stood.
   One of the problems with ``putting censorship laws on the books
and adopting them into policies'' is such a practice makes everyone
afraid, ``And that's what we're talking about here is fear,'' she
said.
   Religious, human rights and gay rights groups met privately with
Moss on Monday and then announced they would hold a ceremony to
honor homosexual victims of the Holocaust when the exhibit opens.
   When first alerted, Moss said he wondered why the issue was
raised at all.
   ``Homosexuality is not a major feature of the Holocaust,'' he
said during the weekend. ``I think the major focus that certainly
needs to be focused on continuously was the religious and cultural
prejudice.''
   Moss amended his statement Monday, saying he was quoted out of
context.
   ``There has never been any question in our minds about the
importance of including the material about the treatment of
homosexuals in the Holocaust,'' he told reporters Monday.
``Homosexuals were poorly treated in the Holocaust, as were Jews,
as were gypsies, as were artists, as were a variety of groups.''
   Geneva Chairman Joseph A. Cannon, who sits on the national
campaign board of the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, had
said he was unaware that anything was being excluded from the
teaching materials.
   ``My hobby is history. And I don't like fooling around with
history,'' he said. ``I really don't think we ought to do something
that ignores a pretty significant element of the Holocaust.''

<TEXT>
   Covenant House officials thwarted investigations
into the murder of a young man who appeared prominently in the
shelter's publications, New York Newsday reported today.
   Covenant House, the largest shelter organization for runaways,
denied knowing the victim, Sean Russell, 23, when a private
investigator inquired about his murder last year, Newsday said.
   Months later, acting Covenant House president Frank Macchiarola
discovered internal memos discussing a possible cover-up, he told
Newsday. The memos contained allegations Russell was involved with
a drug and prostitution ring operating from shelter facilities, he
said.
   Macchiarola had been named last month to replace the Rev. Bruce
Ritter, Covenant House's founder, who resigned after allegations of
sexual misconduct with young runaways. Covenant House is the
world's largest network of shelters for teen-agers.
   Macchiarola resigned after the trustees of the charity
obstructed his attempts to investigate Russell's death, he told
Newsday.
   Officials of the embattled charity declined to comment Monday,
Newsday said.
   According to an account pieced together by Newsday, Russell had
become romantically involved with a 27-year-old woman. On Oct. 20,
her ex-lover, Donald Holden, 45, tied up and raped the woman,
fatally stabbed Russell and then committed suicide by slashing his
own throat.
   Russell appears on page one of the organization's annual report
for 1989, and is featured in the charity's official calendar, which
is received by thousands of contributors.
   According to Newsday, shelter officials deceived a private
investigator, Michael Lipowski, dispatched to look into Russell's
death.
   Lipowski told Newsday that a lawyer for Covenant House and one
of its counselors, Paul Bates, flatly denied that Russell had any
association with the organization.
   Bates acknowledged Monday that he was Russell's counselor but
refused to discuss the young man's life or death, Newsday said.

   Moslem militants hanged two clergymen and
dumped their bodies in a rice field, accusing them of spying on
Kashmiri separatists for the Indian government.
   Officials said the bodies of the two Moslem priests were found
Monday in Phulwama, about 30 miles southeast of Srinagar, the
center of the four-decade-old separatist campaign.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said one
person was fatally shot by militants who suspected him of being a
police informer. The shooting occurred when curfew was lifted
Monday night.
   Curfew was reimposed today at 9 a.m. after the 14-hour
relaxation to allow night celebration of a Moslem festival.
   At least 180 people have died in the latest round of violence
that flared Jan. 20 following a government crackdown on the
movement for predominantly Moslem Jammu-Kashmir's independence from
mostly Hindu India.
   The Hezbul Mujahedeen, or the Party of the Islamic Holy
Warriors, claimed responsibility for the slayings of the two
clergymen in telephone calls late Monday night to reporters in
Srinagar.
   The party is the second-largest militant group in Kashmir.
   ``We interrogated (the priests) and punished them because they
were agents of the intelligence bureau of India,'' said a man
claiming to be the group's spokesman who did not wish to be
identified.
   He said the two men were hanged Sunday night. A third Moslem
clergyman was burned to death after the ``interrogation,'' he said,
but the claim could not be immediately confirmed.
   The two men who were hanged were kidnapped about a week ago, he
said.
   Gov. Jagmohan of Jammu-Kashmir state confirmed the two deaths
but did not say if the militants were involved.
   Jammu-Kashmir is India's only state with a Moslem majority. The
secession movement has been alternately simmering and flaring since
1947 when the old princely state of Kashmir, then governed by a
Hindu ruler, merged with India.
   Moslem militants had earlier demanded union with neighboring
Pakistan, an Islamic nation, but in the past year have demanded
independence and the status of a neutral country.
   Pakistan also claims the state because of its predominantly
Moslem population and has twice gone to war with India over the
region. Pakistan now controls the western part of the state, while
the larger portion is governed by India.
   About 64 percent of the Indian Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people
are Moslem. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880
million people, while Hindus account for 82 percent.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ In the 1970s, Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot campaigned for equal rights for women when it was
illegal for a married woman to have a bank account or buy property
without her husband's written approval.
   The law has since been changed. Women are no longer ``legal
minors'' in Haiti. And the 46-year-old Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot is no
longer just an author and lawyer.
   After the fall of dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier in
1986, she was appointed to the 12-member Supreme Court, becoming
the first and only woman to sit on the body.
   She was to be inaugurated president today, becoming the first
woman to lead this troubled 186-year-old Caribbean nation.
   Before being appointed to the Supreme Court, she was the first
woman named to the executive committee of the Haiti's Bar
Association and to the Appeals Court. Throughout, she has
maintained a reputation for political independence.
   Francois Latourte, a former justice minister, said he ``highly
recommended'' her to the Supreme Court after studying her record.
   ``She was a distinguished and competent judge, a remarkable
woman,'' said Latourte. ``I did not hesitate to recommend her as
the first woman justice.''
   She is the author of several books about law. Her best-known
work, ``The Judicial Status of Haitian Women in Social
Legislation,'' was written in 1973, two years after graduation from
law school.
   She is a member of the Association of French-Language Writers.
   ``She has had a meteoric career,'' said Ernst Malbranche, former
president of the Haitian Bar Association.
   She is the widow of Ernst Trouillot, a distinguished lawyer who
presided over the Port-au-Prince Bar Association until his death
last year. The couple had one daughter.
   The horror of the harsh Duvalier family rule touched Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot in the late 1960s.
   Her brother, jazz guitarist Alix Pascal, was shot in the back in
Port-au-Prince during a rehearsal. The assailant was a Tonton
Macoute, the feared secret police of Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father and predecessor.
   Left paralyzed, he now lives in New York City.
   When opposition parties nominated Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot on
Monday to become provisional president, she took the news in stride.
   ``She was shocked but she expected it. We had told her,'' said
Jean-Claude Roy, a leading member of the Unity Assembly opposition
coalition.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands Relocated to Control Dissent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burmese military authorities have moved
tens of thousands of people from the cities to outlying areas in an
effort to control political dissent, two Western diplomats said
today.
   ``They are getting rid of potential flash points,'' one diplomat
said. ``Some areas were more active than others during the
demonstrations and the army wants to have people where it can
easily control them.''
   One diplomat, citing reports from the new settlements before the
government recently stopped allowing visits, said ``certainly in
many cases the move was involuntary.''
   ``From the estimates that we have built up we would say that the
total figure would be up to half a million people countrywide,''
the other diplomat said.
   The relocations began early last year, said the diplomats, who
were reached in Rangoon by telephone and spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   They said the action apparently was aimed partly at breaking up
blocs of anti-government sentiment in the cities, where millions of
people took to the streets two years ago to demonstrate against the
authoritarian rule of Gen. Saw Maung.
   The general seized power in a September 1988 coup, and his
troops suppressed the demonstrations, killing hundreds of people.
   The movements also may be an attempt to influence voting
patterns in the scheduled May 27 election, which are to be the
first multiparty polling in three decades, the diplomats said.
   Authorities already have barred Aung San Suu Kyi and other
opposition leaders from running in the election.
   The diplomats said many of the new settlements had no running
water or electricity, and some were malaria-infested. Armed
soldiers often supervised the relocations, herding people into
trucks, they said.
   They said most of the people were moved from the capital,
Rangoon, but others were moved from the northern cities of Mandalay
and Taunggyi to outlying areas.
   ``In Rangoon it is very extensive,'' one diplomat said. ``People
are ordered by the military to dismantle their houses at their own
cost.''
   In Bangkok last week, Burma's minister of health and education,
Pe Thein, said the relocations were for ``sanitary'' reasons.
   ``We want Rangoon to be a good clean city and these are just
squatters,'' he said.
   Citizens have held small-scale demonstrations despite
restrictions, and one diplomat cited reports of protests in
Mandalay at the beginning of March involving up to 200 Buddhist
monks. The protesters had demanded the release of opposition
leaders and other dissidents, he said.

   A man jumped into the sea with
his five children in an apparent suicide attempt, and he and three
of the children died, a news agency reported today.
   The man clutched the children, taking them by surprise, and
jumped off a pier Monday at Port Elizabeth on the southeast coast,
the independent South African Press Association said.
   Two of the children were rescued, but the man and the other
children drowned despite efforts to save them, the report said. The

   President Bush is seeking a quick $300 million
aid infusion to help salvage Nicaragua's war-battered economy and
to solidify the political ground under president-elect Violeta
Chamorro, administration sources say.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said in Asuncion, Paraguay, this
morning that he told outgoing Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
the aid package ``will take the fighters and try to make them
farmers.''
   Bush scheduled a morning news conference to announce the aid
package. He was expected to press Congress to enact the emergency
appropriation by April 25, when Mrs. Chamorro is to be inaugurated
in her country's first peaceful transition to a democratically
elected government.
   Bush also is expected to announce the lifting of U.S. trade
sanctions that have been in place since May 1, 1985, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mrs. Chamorro, leader of the 14-party coalition that upset
President Daniel Ortega of the leftist Sandinista Party on Feb. 25,
will inherit a country whose economy has been devastated by a
decade of mismanagement and war. Bush called Mrs. Chamorro on
Monday to brief her on the package, a source said.
   On Capitol Hill, Bush's aid proposal will fall into place behind
a pending $500 million request for emergency money for Panama,
which has been bogged down in disputes about how the new aid will
be funded and how it will be used.
   ``After 10 years of trying to destroy Nicaragua, we do have a
responsibility to help democracy,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that doles out
foreign aid.
   ``I may well agree with whatever the president's policy is
there. But I don't think it is wise to be raising expectations by
promising money we don't know whether we have,'' Leahy said.
   The $300 million request will be paid for, like the supplemental
money bill for Panama, through commensurate cuts in various
Pentagon accounts in the current fiscal year.
   The request includes about $30 million to help pay costs of
relocating some 10,000 Contra rebels and tens of thousands of
family members from their camps along the Honduran border to homes
inside Nicaragua, administration sources said.
   Supplementing that amount will be roughly $10 million left over
from a humanitarian aid program for the rebels and from an
international oversight panel set up to help the Central American
peace process.
   In addition to the demobilization money for the U.S.-backed
rebels, Bush will ask for emergency agricultural aid to help
Nicaraguan farmers meet May planting deadlines, the sources said.
   Some of the money also could be used to repatriate other
Nicaraguan refugees who fled the country during the Sandinistas'
10-year rule, the sources said.
   The package also will include money to help the country buy oil,
which in the past has been supplied through Cuba. The incoming
government fears that the Sandinistas will have exhausted the
country's stocks of oil by the time they turn over power, officials
said.
   U.S. aid would help Nicaragua buy oil from other sources,
presumably Mexico and Venezuela, said one senior administration
official.
   Money for planting, oil purchases and Contra demobilization,
plus smaller amounts for medical and technical economic assistance,
would make up roughly half of the $300 million package, the sources
said.
   The other $150 million, which has not yet been as clearly
defined, would go to help Nicaragua pay off overdue international
financial obligations and to encourage economic development, they
said.
   Bush also may outline the need for additional money for
Nicaragua, probably somewhat less than $300 million, in the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1, the sources said.
   The money request reflects needs outlined in meetings that
Francisco Mayorga, the leading economic strategist for the new
Chamorro government, held last week with U.S. officials in the
administration and on Capitol Hill.
   The administration hopes the urgency of the Nicaraguan request
will help provide some momentum for its stalled aid request for
Panama. The Panama measure has been delayed by arguments with
Congress over which defense accounts were being cut to fund it, and
over the size of the request.
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, installed after the U.S.
invasion that ousted dictator Manuel Noriega in December, is on a
hunger strike perceived partly as a protest over the slow pace of
U.S. aid to his country.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler noted Monday that
$55 million in aid already was being used in Panama to rebuild
damage from the invasion, create public works jobs and help
establish a police force.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today called Lithuania's
declaration of independence ``illegal and invalid'' but urged
patience, saying Moscow's relations with the Baltic republic would
continue unchanged for now.
   He said a commission was studying how to respond to Lithuania's
action.
   In comments to the Congress of People's Deputies, Gorbachev
indicated that Lithuania's independence drive is likely to
encounter formidable resistance. He said the Kremlin would not
begin negotiations with the three Baltic republics on the
independence they are seeking.
   ``We cannot talk about negotiations,'' he said. ``You carry out
negotiations with a foreign country.''
   But several lawmakers said it was likely Gorbachev would soften
his positon.
   The Soviet leader told the 2,000 deputies that Premier Nikolai
Ryzhkov and a commission were studying the Lithuanian
``situation.'' On Sunday, Lithuania's legislature reclaimed the
sovereignty the nation lost 50 years ago.
   Gorbachev won applause from the Congress when he said the
Kremlin would not give in to demands to negotiate independence with
republics seeking independence, including the other two Baltic
states _ Latvia and Estonia.
   The Lithuanians want recognition as a sovereign state and the
start of talks on secession. On Monday, the Estonians called for
talks with Moscow on independence. All three republics were
forcibly annexed in 1940.
   At one point, calling the Lithuanians ``comrades,'' Gorbachev
paused and then said, ``I think they are comrades.''
   The Soviet leader made a point of welcoming the presence of
Lithuanian deputies at the Congress. But Lithuanian deputy Vaidotas
Antanaitis said they now considered themselves observers.
   Antanaitis read excerpts from the declaration of independence,
together with appeals for recognition of their sovereignty. He said
Lithuania wants good relations with Moscow, and called for
negotiations.
   Gorbachev offered no reaction.
   Another Lithuanian deputy, Algimountas Chekuolis, said he
believed the Soviet leader would soften his position. ``Gorbachev
is a realist,'' he said. ``He'll change his stand.''
   Ingrik Toome, a deputy and premier of Estonia, said Estonians
and Latvians were upset by Gorbachev's statement there would be no
negotiations, but added that the Soviet leader might not yet have
fully explained his position.
   ``So far, many of his political steps have shown that he has to
start these negotiations,'' Toome said.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party chief, Algerdis Brazauskas, told
reporters he met with Gorbachev early today, and ``there were no
reproaches, contacts have not been broken.'' Brazauskas lost the
post of Lithuanian parliament president last weekend.
   On Monday, conservative Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev ruled
out the use of force against the republic of 3.7 million people.
``We will not use force,'' he declared, ``We must resolve this by
political means.''
   In January, Red Army troops stormed the Azerbaijani capital of
Baku to put down unrest fueled by independence demands, killing
dozens. In April 1989, troops killed at least 19 people in Tbilisi,
the capital of Georgia, during an independence demonstration.
   In order to make Sunday's declaration a reality, Lithuania must
resolve a daunting array of questions, including matters of
territory, compensation, the status of thousands of Soviet
soldiers, ownership of factories and land, and control of the
police and KGB.
   ``Hope and joy must dissolve into determination to work for
Lithuania,'' the republic's new president, Vytautas Landsbergis,
told the Lithuanian legislature in its capital of Vilnius on
Monday. ``We must work very hard.''
   The Tass news agency said Lithuanian legislators declared that
their sons no longer need serve in the Soviet Army and appealed to
Gorbachev to ensure the welfare of Lithuanian soldiers until
negotiations start on mustering them out.
   Lithuanians said they expected at least a partial economic
blockade by the Soviet side, which supplies all of the fuel to the
republic.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov asserted Monday
that Lithuania cannot go it alone in the world market.
   ``Lithuania is not self-sufficient, if only because it receives
energy at subsidized prices,'' he said.
   A barrel of oil costs $15.70 on the world market, but the
Lithuanians get a barrel for less than a dollar from the Soviets,
he said.
   A week ago, Gorbachev demanded in talks with Brazauskas that the
republic pay 21 billion rubles in hard currency _ about $34 billion
_ for Soviet investment in factories and infrastructure during the
past half-century.
   The Soviet leader also suggested Lithuania might have to hand
over the Baltic port of Klaipeda, a key city that the independent
republic would need to carry out foreign trade.
   But Algimontas Chekuolis, a leader of the pro-independence
Lithuanian political movement Sajudis, said in an interview at the
Congress that the Kremlin also owes.
   The Kremlin should pay 300 billion rubles to compensate for
300,000 people who were killed, imprisoned or exiled by Stalin and
his successors, and for the economic havoc caused by a half-century
of Soviet mismanagement.
   The Congress of People's Deputies was called into session in
Moscow to consider a strong, new presidency that Gorbachev wants to
establish. Lithuanians rushed their new legislature into session to
declare independence before Gorbachev could be elected to that post.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton and union leaders
resumed talks today in the state's first teachers strike, which has
forced the cancellation of classes for half of the public school
students.
   Caperton spokesman G.C. Morse said no agreement had been reached
in Monday's talks but the two sides were closer to a settlement.
   The strike began last Wednesday in a dispute over wages and
benefits. Teachers stayed away from class Monday despite a warning
from the governor that they could be fired for striking in
violation of state law. No immediate disciplinary action was taken.
   Union leaders have said they won't go back to work until
Caperton calls a special legislative session to consider pay
raises; the governor said he won't consider calling a special
session until the teachers go back to work.
   In West Virginia, pay scales for teachers are set by the
Legislature.
   Caperton met with Kayetta Meadows, president of the
16,000-member West Virginia Education Assocation, and Bob Brown,
head of the 3,000-member West Virginia Federation of Teachers.
   Union officials said they had agreed not to discuss the content
of the talks.
   Caperton was to make a ``major policy address'' on education
tonight, his office said in a statement.
   It didn't say if the speech was strike-related, and his
spokesmen were unavailable late Monday.
   Pickets spread to 46 of the state's 55 counties Monday. Classes
were canceled in 29 counties, leaving nearly 150,000 of the state's
328,000 public school students at home. About 3,000 of the state's
teachers are not unionized.
   Teachers picketed in shorts and T-shirts throughout the state,
which enjoyed a sunny, 80-degree day.
   At Charleston's Capitol High School, only about 400 of the
school's 1,300 students showed up. ``We've been wasting our time,''
said Shawna Adkins, a sophomore. ``All we do is watch movies, and
we can do that at home.''
   Outside Caperton's office, Keith Geiger, president of the
National Education Association, addressed about 1,000 teachers.
   ``This isn't fun, but it is necessary,'' said Geiger, whose
union is the parent of the WVEA. ``You must stick together until a
resolution is there. It is not the time for individual decisions on
how you should operate.''
   West Virginia teachers average about $21,900 per year, less than
in any state except Arkansas and South Dakota, according to the
National Education Association.
   In Ohio County in the northern panhandle, classes were canceled
after it was discovered most of the district's 47 buses had flat
tires, said Superintendent H. Lawrence Jones. He said it was
unclear who was responsible.

<HEAD>Senator's Widow Claims Navy Doctors' Malpractice Led To Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The anger U.S. Sen. John East felt against Navy
doctors when he committed suicide in 1986 was unjustified, a
government attorney said in opening arguments of a wrongful death
lawsuit brought by his widow.
   East was cured of a serious thyroid disorder with synthetic
drugs 11 months before the North Carolina Republican asphyxiated
himself with carbon monoxide, Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Ringler
said Monday.
   Priscilla East, 58, of Greenville, N.C., contends her husband
believed the doctors' failure to diagnose his condition for several
years had caused his mental and physical powers to deteriorate.
   Her $3.5 million claim is believed to be the first wrongful
death lawsuit against the government by the family of a U.S.
senator.
   ``Not every death is someone else's responsibility,'' Ringler
said. ``The evidence in this case will demonstrate that the only
one responsible for John East's death was John East himself.''
   Ringler also disputed the claim that hypothyroidism dulled
East's mental abilities, saying he led an active life until his
death.
   East left a suicide note on June 29, 1986, saying doctors at
Bethesda Naval Medical Center outside Washington, D.C., ``ruined my
health'' by failing for years to diagnose his hypothyroidism.
   The disease occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce the
hormones necessary to maintain the body's metabolism.
   Mrs. East's attorney argued that East suffered from a series of
symptoms, including fatigue and inability to sleep, for two years
while under the care of Rear Adm. Freeman Cary, who was then
attending physician at the U.S. Capitol.
   Mrs. East's attorney said Cary did not diagnose the thyroid
problem.
   Cary is not named in the lawsuit. Survivors cannot sue
individual military doctors but can file claims against the
government.
   It was not until April 1985, when East fell into a near-fatal
coma caused by hypothyroidism, that the correct diagnosis was made,
according to court documents. Until then, Cary had recommended
psychiatric treatment and other medical tests, attorneys on both
sides said.
   Ringler said East saw his own doctor during his first 2{ years
in the Senate, and when he did consult the attending physician's
office, did not describe symptoms that could have led to a proper
diagnosis.
   On the stand, East's widow painted a picture of an intelligent,
vigorous former Marine who fought polio as a young man and
relentlessly pursued his professional and political goals until he
became sick in 1983.
   Her voice broke repeatedly when she described his struggle
against the polio that paralyzed his lower body in 1955. After
undergoing a spinal tap, he told her from a stretcher, ``You know,
Pris, everything will be all right,'' she recalled.
   U.S. District Judge Walter Black Jr. is hearing the case without
a jury. The trial is expected to last several weeks.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said today
he pressed Paraguayan President Andres Rodriguez for progress on
human rights and is convinced Rodriguez ``is dedicated to
democracy.''
   Quayle met with opposition political leaders and planned a
second meeting later in the day with Rodriguez.
   The vice president, fresh from talks with President Daniel
Ortega on a peaceful transfer of power in Nicaragua, said he
pressed for progress on human rights in his first meeting with
Rodriguez, shortly after his arrival Monday night from Santiago,
Chile.
   ``I have already talked to him about human rights and the
advancement of democracy,'' Quayle told reporters when asked about
a State Department report that criticizes Paraguay for continued
human rights problems.
   ``I'm convinced he is dedicated to democracy,'' Quayle said of
Rodriguez. ``He's certainly moving along the road of democracy,''
the vice president said before meeting with opposition leaders
representing various political parties.
   No other U.S. president or vice president has visited Paraguay
since the 1950s, when Richard Nixon stopped there as vice president.
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, were honored Monday night in a
gala dinner at the palace of Rodriguez, who gave the Quayles a pair
of young spotted jaguars. The jaguar is native to Paraguay.
   Rodriguez is the former armed forces general who overthrew
military dictator Gen. Alfred Stroessner in February 1989.
Rodriguez won the election he called in May in a country where
political diversity was squelched in the 34-year Stroessner regime.
   Quayle's message during his brief stay here is to praise the
move toward democracy but also urge continued progress toward
democratization, said the vice president's chief of staff, Bill
Kristol.
   Although the Rodriguez government has taken significant steps to
reverse repression that was prevalent under Stroessner, the Bush
administration wants to see greater strides, according to the 1990
State Department report on human rights in Paraguay.
   The country's armed forces under Rodriguez have been used to
forcibly remove poor squatters from farmland, and government
corruption remains a serious problem, the report said.
   While some human rights violations have been recorded, the State
Department said they do not appear to be systemic or reflective of
government policy.
   About 200 anti-American protesters demonstrated peacefully
against Quayle's visit in the central part of Asuncion, but Quayle
did not see them.
   Earlier Monday, Quayle met for 1{ hours with Nicaragua's Ortega
as both attended a lunch hosted at the presidential palace by
Chile's newly inaugurated president, Patricio Aylwin.
   Quayle said Ortega promised there will be a peaceful transition
of government when he hands over the presidency on April 25 to
Violeta Chamorro, the U.S.-backed candidate who defeated the
leftist Ortega in the Feb. 25 election.

   Mayor Marion Barry, arrested in January on a
charge of possession of cocaine, is returning to the nation's
capital after seven weeks of substance abuse treatment.
   A mayoral spokeswoman, Vera Jackson, ended speculation about the
mayor's whereabouts, saying he would hold a news conference in
Washington later today. Barry has been enrolled in treatment
centers in Florida and South Carolina since his arrest on the
charge of possession of crack cocaine.
   During his absence, Barry's political support has eroded, with
the city's non-voting delegate to Congress, Walter Fauntroy,
entering the mayoral race, and top supporters, including the
co-chairman of Barry's campaign finance committee, joining the
Fauntroy camp.
   The mayor's whereabouts were the subject of much speculation but
no answers Monday as his aides tried to learn whether he had
checked out of the South Carolina substance abuse program to return
to the nation's capital.
   ``I would say he is in South Carolina, but I don't want to put
my foot in my mouth,'' said Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley. ``I
have no reason to believe that he is elsewhere, but he could be in
transit right now. I don't know anything definitive yet, but
there's no reason to believe he is out there in limbo somewhere.''
   Madelyn Andrews, a spokeswoman for City Administrator Carol B.
Thompson, said her office didn't know Barry's whereabouts,
``although we feel confident we could contact him through the
treatment center if we had to.''
   Thompson is handling the day-to-day chores of the running the
government, but she is not authorized to sign legislation or
approve spending bills.
   A Thompson aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
city administrator had been unable to locate Barry on Monday and
was ``incredibly irritated.''
   ``She is trying to run things, but no one can find him,'' the
aide said. ``That is truly frustrating.''
   Top government officials had predicted the mayor, who has been
enrolled in two substance programs since shortly after being
arrested in January on a drug charge, would return to the city last
weekend.
   But Barry did not return to Washington on Saturday or Sunday.
   Rackley said she believed Barry was still at the Fenwick Hall
Hospital outside Charleston, S.C., where he has been enrolled since
Feb. 23.
   Rackley said Barry can always be reached ``because he travels
with security, and the security officers are police, and the police
department can always contact them.''
   ``There would be no reason for anyone to look for him today,
because there are no burning issues,'' she said.
   ``I do not know where he is,'' said Corporation Counsel Herbert
O. Reid Sr., a longtime Barry confidant.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir fired Vice
Premier Shimon Peres today in a dispute over peace talks and all
the Cabinet members of Peres' Labor Party quit, collapsing the
15-month-old coalition government.
   Peres' dismissal and the resignations do not take effect for 48
hours, leaving room for a last-ditch compromise. ``Things could
happen, the situation can change,'' Shamir said on Israel radio.
   But reconciliation seemed remote as Labor leaders ruled out
further contacts with Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc. ``The
compromises... are behind us, not before us,'' Peres said.
   The collapse of the coalition sent party leaders searching for
alliances to form a new government before a planned no-confidence
vote in Parlaiment Thursday. Both Likud and the center-left Labor
Party are seeking alliances with small religious parties, who hold
a swing vote.
   If the no-confidence motion fails, Shamir could remain prime
minister by forming an alliance with the smaller parties. If it
passes, Shamir remains head of a caretaker government until a new
government is formed by either Labor or Likud.
   The dispute is over Labor's support of a U.S. proposal to hold
peace talks in Cairo with a Palestinian delegation. The delegates
would discuss plans for elections in the occupied territories on
self-rule for the Palestinians.
   Likud objects to involving the 140,000 Arabs in east Jerusalem
in the elections.
   In a radio interview, Shamir said he acted to preempt Labor's
efforts to muster a majority for Thursday's Parliament vote. He
said the Jerusalem issue was the main obstacle.
   ``These differences of opinion are not so small...they exist and
firstly about Jerusalem, an issue about which we are very
sensitive, especially these days when we hear voices from the
United States,'' Shamir said.
   The remark was an allusion to recent statements by U.S. leaders,
including President Bush, suggesting Jerusalem could be negotiable
in peace talks and Bush's criticism earlier this month of building
Jewish neighborhoods in east Jerusalem.
   Both Labor and Likud maintain that Jerusalem is not negotiable,
but Labor favors a compromise: allowing Jerusalem Palestinians to
vote elsewhere in the disputed lands.
   Israel radio said today that Shamir also considered submitting
his resignation before Thursday, but the premier denied it.
   After leaving the Cabinet, Peres raised the possibility of
avoiding new elections by forming a Labor-led government with
ultra-Orthodox and left-wing parties.
   The balance of power is held by two ultra-Orthodox religious
parties who have seven of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or
parliament. Labor and its allies control 55 seats, while Likud and
its partners control 58.
   Explaining the prime minister's decision to expel Labor from the
coalition, Shamir spokesman Yossi Achimier said his boss ``wants
only one thing: to prevent a Palestinian state.''
   Labor Communications Minister Gad Yacobi said Shamir's decision
to end the coalition ruined prospects for a Palestinian-Israeli
dialogue: ``The prime minister has closed the door on the peace
process...for this he bears heavy national responsibility.''
   Palestinians described the collapse as a setback for Israel's
plan to hold elections in the occupied territories as a first step
in resolving the Palestinian problem.
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said ``I believe Israel has killed
its own peace plan ... and this will have very dangerous
repercussions throughout the Middle East.''
   Freij alluded to predictions that without an active process
Arab-Israeli tensions would increase and result in violence, both
in the occupied territories and from radical Palestinian groups
abroad.
   Baruch Askarov, an aide to Peres, said today's Cabinet session
began with stormy arguments between the two sides and then Shamir
announced the dismissal of the Labor leader. The other Labor
ministers then submitted resignations prepared in advance, he said.
   Peres' dismissal came after the Labor Party's 1,300-member
Central Committee voted Monday night to give the party's leaders
the power to pull out of the government if progress was not made in
the Middle East Peace process.
   Likud argues that accepting the U.S. peace plan would mean
implicitly recognizing the Palestine Liberation Organization and
bringing into question Israeli control over Arab east Jerusalem,
which was annexed after its seizure with the occupied lands in the
1967 Middle East war.
   More than 660 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in a
27-month-old uprising against occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel, and more than 40
Israelis have died.

   John Doe the amnesia victim: Is he
Melvin Wolf, the Texas repairman who disappeared last year? Is he
Jim J. King, the California insurance man who vanished 12 years
ago? Or some mysterious combination of both?
   The case began in October, when police in Topeka, Kan., found
the man wandering without identification. He said he didn't
remember who he was or how he came to be there.
   He was known only as John Doe until Feb. 10, when relatives who
saw him on television identified him as 53-year-old Melvin Wolf, a
small-appliance repairman who disappeared in August from his
sister's home in Angleton, Texas.
   Wolf's family has taken the man in and, short of fingerprinting,
there seems little doubt that Doe was Wolf _ at least for much of
his life.
   On Feb. 28, a Topeka TV station reported that Wolf maintained
the separate identity of Jim J. King, a successful insurance
salesman from Burbank, Calif., who hasn't been seen since 1978.
   On March 6, a third identity surfaced _ that of Robert J. Hart,
a Denny's restaurant employee in Washington, D.C.
   ``I was just now accepting that I'm Melvin Wolf. Now I don't
know who I am again,'' the man said recently.
   Police haven't had time to run down the Hart story, but Burbank
police spokesman Sgt. Don Goldberg said authorities believe Wolf
and King are the same person.
   Goldberg said investigators were still seeking dental records or
other proof.
   King's wife, Ann, reported him missing March 31, 1978, under
``suspicious circumstances.'' An investigation turned up nothing
but King's car, found abandoned two months later in a Burbank
parking lot, Goldberg said.
   Authorities investigated King's insurance dealings for any
misconduct, Goldberg said, but did not find enough evidence to
charge the man. The investigation is still open.
   Burbank police have been searching for Mrs. King since reports
that King might be Wolf surfaced recently. So far, they haven't
found her.
   The man who could be King is about 6 feet tall with white hair,
a weathered face and a rural accent. Wolf _ or King _ left Topeka
on Feb. 28 to stay with Wolf's relatives in Angleton.
   Wolf's sister, Donna Caskey, said the family had lost track of
him for many years before he turned up in Angleton in 1986. During
much of that lost time, they heard stories that Wolf was living in
California, Caskey said last month.
   The mysterious man and his Angleton relatives have refused to
give interviews since the reports of his multiple identities.
   Rick Selig, a therapist at the Topeka Psychiatric Clinic, said
the man suffered from psychogenic amnesia _ a total memory loss
normally brought on by an extremely stressful event.
   The question, Selig said, is what caused the amnesia. Selig is
trying to find out through hypnotherapy.
   The Pentagon says Wolf joined the Army in 1953 and was stationed
in West Germany from 1957 to 1960. He left the service in 1961.
   Employees of a Prudential Life Insurance Co. office in Los
Angeles said they recognize the man as King, their lost colleague.
They said they had assumed that King was abducted and killed in
1978.
   Prudential employee Eugene Bullington said watching a TV report
``was like seeing someone come back from the dead.''
   Herb Pierce, who hired King in the Prudential office in 1969,
said King and his wife had two children. Burbank police have no
record of the children, Goldberg said.
   WIBW-TV in Topeka, whose reports led to the man's unfolding
identities, reported that employees at a Denny's in the Washington
area called claiming they had worked with someone who resembled
Wolf and went by the initials R.J.
   Denny's personnel files showed that a Robert J. Hart began
working at the restaurant on April 7, 1978 _ a week after King
disappeared from Burbank. Hart moved in September 1979 to Phoenix,
where he worked at another Denny's until May 1980, WIBW reported.
   Although Wolf, King and Hart had different Social Security
numbers, they listed the same birthplace, West Allis, Wis., and the
same high school in Johnson Creek, Wis., WIBW has reported.
   The school says its records show that none of the three men
studied there.
   Wolf's birthday is Sept. 27, 1936; King and Hart each listed
their birthdays as Sept. 26. But the years were different: King
said he was born in 1940 and Hart in 1943.
   Selig said his patient had been making slow progress in
remembering technical information Wolf would have known, such as
appliance electronics. But he said Wolf had no ``big bang'' of
revelations about his life.
   ``It's kind of preposterous to him how he could have done all
this stuff,'' Selig said. ``It's frightening to him. It's
confusing.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that past use of
marijuana should not be used against a political candidate.
   Bush was asked during a news conference about the Texas
gubernatorial primary election today in which questions of drug use
have been raised. Democratic candidate Ann Richards has lost ground
in public opinion polls after refusing to answer questions about
possible past drug use.
   The president said the importance of such an issue ``is a matter
for the voters to decide, but in my view if somebody used marijuana
some time ago and is not into anything of that nature, why no, I
don't think that should be used against them.'' .
   After his statement on marijuana, Bush was asked about past use
of stronger drugs by a political candidate.
   ``You're getting me involved in the Texas primary, something I
don't want to do,'' he responded.
   ``This is election day in Texas,'' Bush said, adding that he had
voted in the Republican primary but declining to say for whom.
   ``I hope everybody understands,'' Bush said.
   Of the general election, he said, ``I'll be involved but I'm not
going to fine tune that.''

   Here is the text of President Bush's news
conference Tuesday:
   President Bush: Well, we began this administration by saying
that the day of the dictator is over, and now restless millions
have spoken and have elected or prepare to elect new governments,
their governments.
   As long as we live, the images of this revolution, the
revolution of '89, will be with us _ the playwright president in
Prague, the tumbling of the Berlin Wall, crumbling of a Romanian
dictatorship. But this revolution leaves us with a new challenge:
how to best support newborn democracies. This challenge is utterly
unlike the task of rebuilding Europe after the Second World War,
for no single great plan will do. We need a flexible approach, one
that will meet the needs of each country we seek to help.
   Today, I want to speak about how we can best help two
democracies in our hemisphere: Panama and Nicaragua. We should take
great pride in the way in which our leadership, Congress and the
administration, helped the democratic spirit take hold in these two
countries.
   But this is no time to bask in self-praise. These nations need
our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by years of strife and
oppression, years of loss and deprivation. And we must act and act
soon to help the peoples of these new democracies in two great and
historic tasks: reconstruction and reconciliation.
   I've taken an important step today. As a demonstration of our
resolve to be part of the process of reconciliation, I just signed
an Executive Order to end the economic embargo against Nicaragua.
Americans are determined to help the people of Nicaragua.
   And next, I'm asking the Congress and the American people to
join me in crafting a bipartisan agreement to help both countries.
After all, bipartisanship did work well last year to put the focus
on free elections and end the fighting in Nicaragua. Bipartisanship
also helped bring an end to the tyranny in Panama. And we need to
work again in that same spirit to put together an assistance
program for both countries.
   I'm proposing the creation of a fund for democracy to assist in
the reconstruction and development of these two countries. And I'm
requesting the Congress to approve by April 5 a package of
assistance of $800 million for these two countries using funds from
the defense budget.
   This package consists of $500 million for Panama, already
requested in that Jan. 25 proposal to Congress, along with $70
million for refugees, and an additional $300 million for Nicaragua.
   I'm asking the secretary of state and the secretary of the
treasury to work together on the economic assistance aspects of
these packages and, of course, to consult with the U.S. Congress.
   In addition, under existing authorities, I'm initiating
immediate action to provide $21 million of previously appropriated
economic aid principally for food and humanitarian assistance.
   I also will be sending to the Congress in the future a budget
amendment for an additional $200 million in fiscal '91 for
Nicaragua, consistent with the approach that we've taken this year.
   Moreover, I've instructed the secretary of defense and Dick
Darman at OMB to begin negotiations immediately with the Congress
on mutually acceptable offsets from the defense budget that can be
used for this democracy fund without having an unacceptable impact
on national security.
   I further propose that in the event that an agreement on offsets
cannot be reached by March 27. The Congress authorized me to select
offsets from the defense budget, and should neither of these
alternatives prove to be workable, I am prepared, because of the
dire need for these funds, to ask for a waiver of the Budget Act to
allow this critical program to proceed on the required timetable.
   I urge the Congress to move quickly and also urge in the
strongest terms that it not add any extraneous requests _ items to
this request.
   It is urgent to advance the prospect for democracy and
reconciliation in Nicaragua and Panama. Damage to both economies
has been great. We must help and we want to help. Our help is
needed swiftly to bring about demilitarization and advance the
whole Central American peace process. If bipartisanship prevails we
will be able to meet this goal and respond to the expectations of
our neighbors.

   A high-pressure system pumping tropical air over the eastern
United States today broke hundreds of heat records, spread deadly
fog over highways and left budding trees vulnerable to the nip of a
late frost.
   ``I played golf yesterday, and I said then I was playing again
today,'' said Gene Novak, a real estate manager in Baltimore, where
the temperature hit 95 on Monday. ``What the heck? My boss is
away.''
   The National Weather Service forecast summery weather again
today in most of the country east of the Mississippi. Temperatures
up to 25 degrees above normal were expected through midweek.
   Grand Rapids, Mich., got an early start on today's summerlike
trend _ its temperature at midnight tied the record high for
today's date at 68.
   Monday's high in Baltimore broke the city's 100-year-old record
by 19 degrees, and from North Dakota to Georgia it was a good day
for sunbathers and fishermen. Record highs were recorded in more
than 100 cities.
   In the nation's capital, the high of 87 was the warmest on
record for any day in March. The warmth threatened to make
Washington's cherry trees bloom too early for the annual Cherry
Blossom Festival, scheduled to begin April 1.
   In South Carolina, peach farmers worried that a late frost could
nip the budding peach blossoms. ``They are not far enough along to
be out of damage,'' said Henry Nunnery of the York County Extension
Office.
   Dense fog caused by the warm air flowing over snow and frozen
ground was reported from North Dakota into Michigan, reducing
visibility to zero in places and delaying planes at airports Monday.
   In Green Bay, where the day's reading of 70 broke the old mark
by 15 degrees, a 100-foot-long ``white wall'' of fog and paper-mill
smoke caused a flaming, 52-vehicle pileup that killed three people
and injured 30.
   A combination of rain, rapidly melting snow and frozen ground
caused flooding elsewhere in Wisconsin and in Minnesota, although
officials said it had subsided by early today, as did floodwaters
in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   Workers in Danville, Ill., near the Indiana line, built a
floodwall late Monday to protect the Inter-State Water Co., whose
pumps were disabled when Lake Vermilion overflowed its banks during
the weekend.
   Surgery at two Danville hospitals was canceled, and schools were
closed until Thursday, when water is expected to be restored, said
Donald Crews, disaster relief coordinator for the Vermilion County
Red Cross.
   Just north of Lake Vermilion, flooding on the North Fork River
destroyed more than a dozen cabins and mobile homes and damaged
others. Water rushing down the river moved some mobile homes like
``floating projectiles,'' Crews said.
   ``I understand we're supposed to get more rain in the next two
to three days. Who knows what that's going to bring,'' said Crews.
   Highs broken or tied for the date included Augusta, Ga., 88;
Cape Hatteras, N.C., 78; Charleston, W.Va. 87; Chicago 81;
Cincinnati 76; Cleveland 75; Columbia, S.C. 88; Detroit 75;

   President Bush said today he is pursuing all
leads in efforts to secure the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon,
even those ``going around in back alleys.''
   ``When the whole story comes out on this, you are going to be
very, very fascinated with the details, very fascinated,'' he told
reporters at a White House news conference.
   Bush's aides confirmed last week that the president fell victim
to a hoax when he accepted a telephone call from a man purporting
to be Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. The conversation took
place several weeks ago, aides said.
   The president took the call after a man identifying himself as
an Iranaian official contacted the White House to say that
Rafsanjani wanted to talk about the American hostages in Lebanon.
The captives are thought to be held by pro-Iranian Moslem Shiites.
   At his news conference, Bush refused to provide details of what
his administration is doing on behalf of the eight Americans held
in Lebanon.
   But he said: ``There are things that go on, going around in back
alleys and trying to find out information, and we've got to do
that. I owe it to the families of those people and to those people
themselves that are held hostage.''
   The Bush administration's official policy on the hostages is
that it will not negotiate with the hostage-holders or their
patrons. At the same time, officials say they are willing to talk
with anyone about the hostages.
   ``Good will begets good will,'' Bush said.
   Eight Americans are among 18 Westerners thought to be hostages
in Lebanon. The longest held American hostage, Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, will mark
his fifth year in captivity on Friday.
   Bush said administration officials had not been trying to reach
Rafsanjani, who has recently made statements indicating he would
like to see the hostages freed soon.
   ``He's got some political problems at home and we understand
that,'' Bush said of Rafsanjani.
   Earlier, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman, said officials did
not know who initiated the call but he did not rule out that it was
perpetrated by a faction inside the Iranian government.
   While administration officials have said they were encouraged by
Rafsanjani's statements, they say they have no reason to believe
the hostages are on the verge of freedom.

   Let me save the details for congressional briefings and give you
the three broad categories of assistance; aid for democracy, for
development, and for demilitarization.
   We want to help democratic institutions take root in each
country, but democracy begins with the rule of law and respect for
human rights. It needs the support of courts that are fair and free
of every influence but the law. It needs the support of police
forces that are upright and honest, and it needs our support.
   Development and demilitarization, they go hand in hand. They
start when we provide textbooks for children, when we create
thousands of new jobs, when the hand that held a gun guides a plow.
   In short, as we demobilize the military we must mobilize the
market. This is a great and historic task but we are inspired by
the courage of our neighbors. We are close, very, very close to a
hemisphere that is completely democratic, a compass of freedom that
spans half the world from Alaska to Argentina. And facing this
enormous challenge, we are not alone. Other nations can and must
help, but only America can take the lead on this one.
   I stand prepared to work with the Congress to do our part for
reconstruction and reconciliation for democracy. And now, I'd be
glad to respond to questions, and Helen, I believe you have the
first one.
   Q: Thank you, Mr. President. Your warm reception of the
Rostenkowski plan, does that mean you're ready to negotiate tax
increases and a freeze on Social Security benefits, things you have
never gone for in the past?
   A: No, it doesn't.
   Q (Off mike.)
   A: The answer is no. Follow up.
   Q: Follow up?
   A: Yeah.
   Q:You are not willing to negotiate, or what is your --
   A: Overall feeling? Look, I think he, without rancor, without a
lot of rhetoric, made a very broad proposal. We've made a proposal
- the administration. We now would like to hear from the budget
process on the Hill, what their proposal is, and then we'll talk.
But I - perhaps, as I told some reporters yesterday, I was being
receptive though not knocking the things in it we don't like - and
there are plenty - I was somewhat colored by the way in which
Chairman Rostenkowski approached this, and with the, I think,
evident good will on his part and determination to try to break the
ice and move the process forward. We --
   Q: You're not saying whether you would go for a tax increase or
--
   A: No, I'm not for a tax - let me - Q: - how about a freeze on
Social Security?
   A: Well, there's a lot of things I'm not for that are in his
proposal, a lot, including taxes. Yeah, Terry?
   Q: Mr. President, the United States has never recognized the
forced incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. Now that
Lithuania has declared its independence, the United States seems to
be moving tentatively toward full recognition. Is that because
we're afraid of offending Mr. Gorbachev or don't want to alienate
him?
   A: It's because we want to see the evolution of the control of
the territory there, and also, we want to see peaceful resolution
to this question.
   Q: Well, do we still regard Lithuania as a captive nation, along
with the other Baltic States?
   A: We might not use that word, but we never have regarded
Lithuania as incorporated into the Soviet Union. That's been our
policy. And we rejoice as people are permitted the free expression
that we take for granted in this country, and clearly, I think
there's a great deal of interest in this concept of working it out
- Lithuanians working it out with the Soviets to achieve what they
want. And so we're not standing in that way, but in terms of
recognition, there is a standard of control of one's territory that
we are - that I've been advised should guide this. Yeah, right here
- go across and then back.
   Q: Mr. President, are you considered about the apparent
reluctance of the contras to disband? And what can you do about it?
   A: Yes, I am concerned about it. I talked to - and I'm also
concerned about certain military action by the Sandinistas. But I
am also encouraged, Brit, and I am encouraged because yesterday I
talked to Dan Quayle and he told me of his visit with Ortega, where
Ortega seemed concerned about -- seemed willing to transfer the
Defense Ministry, seemed willing to transfer the Interior Ministry,
and was open about the discussion of reducing - I want to be
careful here I don't overstate it -- but reducing military action
on both sides. There is a United Nations vehicle that can be
helpful, ONUCA.
   U-N-U-O-C-A? STAFF: O-N.
   A: O-N. ONUCA. O-N-U-C-A, which is - could have a useful role to
play in the separation of forces and in getting done what Violeta
Chamorro wants, which is to both sides start laying down their
weapons. That ONUCA -(chuckles) - has got - has support from other
leaders in this hemisphere. Carlos Andres Perez I believe supports
it. I know Mrs. Chamorro wants us to give more support to this, so
I will be - I've asked the State Department to look into that
immediately. So I'm less concerned than I was about the peaceful
transfer of power, including the military, but I think to the
degree both sides can start laying down weapons and moving towards
the kind of market economies we are talking about, and with less
reliance on military, it's better. So I can't say I'm not
concerned, but I am encouraged the way it's going so far.
   Q: Mr. President, do you regret the other day raising the issue
of settlements in East Jerusalem?
   A: No, I don't regret it. I think - I think all the speculation
and commentary of the last 10 days have blown things way out of
proportion. What I was doing was reiterating United States policy.
But let me say this. Right now in Israel, there's internal
developments taking place in the political scene there, and I do
not want to look.

   Haitian exiles in Florida aren't sure about the
woman chosen interim president of their homeland following the
departure of a military leader, but they will go along with the
majority, a community leader says.
   Haiti's latest ex-leader, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, left Haiti on
Monday aboard an Air Force plane which brought him to Florida,
where he apparently spent only a few hours before leaving for an
undetermined location.
   A U.S. government official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said Avril left Florida.
   About 300 exiles gathered late Monday, according to police
estimates. Many expressed cautious optimism about the latest
government change which they hope will bring democracy to their
Caribbean homeland.
   They were trying to learn more about Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, the
Supreme Court judge designated by an opposition coalition to head a
provisional civilian government in Haiti.
   The Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, a longtime leader in the south
Florida exile community that numbers at least 150,000, claimed Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot had ties to the former regime of dictator
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier.
   But he added, ``If the Haitian people accept her, we will accept
her. We will be very cautious.''
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's brother, jazz guitarist Alix Pascal, was
shot in the back in Port-au-Prince in the late 1960s by a Tonton
Macoute, the feared secret police of Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier, Jean-Claude's father and predecessor. Pascal now lives in
New York City.
   A group of Haitian exiles demonstrated briefly Monday afternoon
outside the U.S. attorney's office, calling for an indictment of
Avril. Dozens more gathered outside the Haitian Refugee Center in
Miami's Little Haiti neighborhood, listening to radio reports and
speakers.
   Most speakers called for Avril's capture, trial in Haiti and
execution for allegedly ordering the slayings of civilians and
opposition leaders.
   The Haitian military has been linked to shipments of South
American cocaine to Florida, but there was no indication that U.S.
authorities might charge Avril.
   ``As far as any charges are concerned, this office will attempt
to bring an indictment if there is sufficient evidence and
information to justify it. We strongly suggest that anyone that has
such information turn it over to the DEA,'' said Diane Cossin,
executive assistant to U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   The overall mood in Little Haiti seemed more anxious than
boisterous after four years of instability and dashed hopes in
their homeland.
   The mood contrasted with near-riotous celebrations that broke
out on Feb. 7, 1986, when Duvalier fled Haiti to end his family's
29-year rule.
   ``Everybody is happy, but we are still watching,'' said Pierre
Joseph, 30, who said he's been in Florida 10 years. ``Nothing
changed yet. Maybe if we have elections, then it will change.''

   John Poindexter's lawyer attempted today to
undermine Oliver North's damaging testimony by confronting him with
previous, conflicting statements he made in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   In cross-examining the former White House aide, Richard Beckler
brought out North's earlier assertions that he was ordered to
conceal his activities from Poindexter and others in 1984 and most
of 1985.
   North testified at a pre-trial hearing three months ago he had
been told to disclose his Contra-related activities only to
then-national security adviser Robert McFarlane and then-CIA
director William Casey.
   On Monday, North testified that ``I can't think of any''
information he kept from Poindexter, who didn't become national
security adviser until the end of 1985.
   On Monday, North also testified that he watched Poindexter
destroy a politically embarrassing presidential document. The
destruction of the presidential paper depicting U.S. involvement in
a straight arms-for-hostages deal with Iran was the most damaging
testimony North gave Monday during his second day on the witness
stand at Poindexter's trial.
   Today, on cross-examination, Beckler brought out that a
succeeding presidential paper contained much the same language
about U.S. hostages.
   The language in a succeeding paper ``indicates that one of the
missions'' in the Iran arms sales ``was to ... further the release
of American hostages,'' Beckler said. North readily agreed.
   On Monday, Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb asked North, ``You
were present when John Poindexter in his office ... ripped (the
paper) into shreds?''
   ``Not the way you describe,'' said North.
   ``You ... saw'' the former national security ``tear up the
original finding?'' Webb asked.
   ``Tear it in two,'' replied North.
   ``He threw it in a waste basket behind his desk or put it in a
burn bag?'' asked Webb.
   ``I think he just put it on his desk,'' replied North.
   The finding approved a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles
to Iran. On the same day that he destroyed the finding, Poindexter
told some House and Senate intelligence committee members he hadn't
found out about the Hawk shipment until January 1986.
   ``Admiral Poindexter was well aware (of the Hawks shipment) ...
he was aware because you kept advising him about it. Wasn't that
right?'' asked Webb.
   ``Yes,'' replied North.
   President Reagan on Nov. 13, 1986, denied that the U.S.
government was swapping arms for hostages, Webb noted, as he told
North: ``This document (the finding) on its face made Ronald Reagan
out to be making a false statement to the American people.''
   ``I guess so,'' North replied.
   On cross-examining North, Poindexter's lawyer Richard Beckler
tried to portray North as a mid-level staffer who was remote from
the national security adviser.
   ``There are many things you did not tell your superiors,''
Beckler suggested while questioning the ex-National Security
Council aide.
   ``I can't think of any right now,'' North replied, and later
added, ``I tried to keep my superiors apprised.''
   Until he was confronted with testimony he gave at his own trial
last year, North maintained he didn't know his superiors were loath
to use the finding as justification for the Hawks shipment.
   ``If I did, I surmised it,'' North said initially.
   Later, he agreed with his earlier testimony, in which he said
``the political people up the line from me, to include Admiral
Poindexter ... did not want that finding to be used as a
justification for what had happened in 1985.''
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene rebuked North several times
for ``quibbles'' with Webb over minor facts and for repeatedly
failing to remember significant ones.
   ``Almost every time a question is asked, he says he can't
recall,'' the judge complained of North, who had been declared a
hostile witness. ``It's like pulling teeth.''
   North also said Poindexter approved his retrieving highly
classified documents from National Security Council files on Nov.
21, 1986, which North then proceeded to alter and destroy with help
from his secretary, Fawn Hall.
   North said former national security adviser Robert McFarlane
directed him to make the changes in memos which North had written
to McFarlane detailing North's military assistance to the Contras.
   ``Did you find'' McFarlane's request ``at all bizarre,
strange?'' Greene asked North.
   ``These were his (McFarlane's) documents,'' replied North.
   ``These were not personal documents ... Mr. McFarlane's house
mortgage,'' said Greene. ``You don't think that is at all strange?''
   ``I think it was futile,'' said North.
   ``I'm not asking futile,'' said Greene. ``Is this what goes on
at the National Security Council all the time?
   ``No, your honor,'' said North.
   Among the documents destroyed was a handwritten note by
Poindexter suggesting that something be done to stop a
Nicaraguan-bound shipload of military equipment.

   Testing of an experimental vaccine on
California AIDS patients will be expanded and extended to
individuals who are infected with the AIDS virus but have not
developed symptoms of the disease.
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted permission
for further testing of the vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk.
   The vaccine, which uses an inactivated virus, is being tested as
a treatment for AIDS rather than as an agent to prevent someone
from acquiring the fatal disease, which destroys the body's ability
to fight infection.
   Researchers are trying to find out whether the inactivated virus
will cause the body to produce specific cells, called T cells, that
destroy other cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV.
   They hope that by stimulating the immune system's response to
HIV, the vaccine might halt or reverse spread of the virus in newly
infected people _ those who have the virus but have not developed
symptoms of AIDS or AIDS-related complex.
   ``This vaccine is for treatment'' of AIDS, said Dr. Janet
Woodcock, director of the FDA's division of biological
investigational new drugs. ``Use of this to prevent acquiring
(AIDS) is a totally different question.''
   But she added: ``Trials like this in the HIV-infected could
yield information that could help design trials for the
uninfected.''
   Work has been accelerating on developing a vaccine to prevent
AIDS, but such a vaccine is at least 10 years away from being
marketed, she added.
   Under the FDA-approved plan, initial testing will involve about
60 people. During a 36-week trial, researchers will test different
doses of the vaccine.
   The California trials, which is testing individuals who have
AIDS, were approved under a state law that allows such testing
strictly within California.
   FDA permission was required for the sponsor, Immune Products
Ltd. of San Diego, to expand the trials to testing centers outside
California.
   Directors of the California study are seeking Roman Catholic
priests and nuns as volunteers to take the vaccine as a control
group because of their celibate lifestyles. If any of those
volunteers developed AIDS, it would be because the vaccine was
flawed.
   In the FDA-approved trials, only people already infected with
the virus will be able to participate in the testing.
   Two other vaccines, both genetically engineered, have been
approved for human testing in HIV-infected individuals. The first,
approved in August 1987, was made from an insect virus and
developed by MicroGeneSys Inc. of West Haven, Conn. The second,
made from the vaccinia virus and developed by Bristol-Myers-Squibb
Co. of New York, was approved for human trials in November 1987.
   A genetically engineered vaccine uses pieces of the virus that
are replicated and do not contain anything that could be infectious.
   Unlike those two, the Salk vaccine uses an inactivated virus
that has been partially stripped of its envelope or surface
proteins. Salk used a similar technique in developing the polio
vaccine.
   Using an inactivated virus in an uninfected person carries the
risk that some traces of the virus may still be live and could
infect the person being vaccinated.

   A tractor-trailer rig rolled over on
Interstate 295 today, spilling hydrochloric acid that forced the
evacuation of nearby homes and school offices while authorities
sealed off the area and began a cleanup.
   By late morning, the leak had been plugged, according to a fire
dispatcher.
   Nearby residents in Portland and Falmouth were evacuated because
of the potential for toxic fumes from the acid, also known as
muriatic acid, but officials had no immediate estimate of how many
people left.
   ``We haven't been keeping count,'' said Portland Police Lt. Jim
Stanhope.
   Authorities also had no estimate of the amount of acid spilled
or how concentrated it was.
   The driver of the truck and a passerby who stopped to help her
were taken to Maine Medical Center, but they were soon released,
said state Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland.
   The truck was owned by Road and Sea Transport Inc., of Hampden,
and was headed for Rhode Island, said a company dispatcher, Steve
Morgan, who said he had no additional information.

   Here are major elements of President Bush's
aid package for Nicaragua and Panama.
   OVERALL FUNDS. Bush coupled a $300 million aid package to help
Nicaragua speed the transition to democracy with a renewed request
for $500 million in aid to Panama. He requested the Panama money
earlier this year, but it got sidetracked in Congress on other
issues.
   The Nicaragua and Panama money would be diverted from
unspecified Pentagon programs. An existing $21 million would be
used for emergency aid to Nicaragua, including food. Some of it
would be used to help re-integrate the Contra rebels.
   TRADE. The president lifted a five-year-old trade embargo
against Nicaragua. He also took steps to allow Nicaragua to resume
shipping sugar to the United States and to make that nation
eligible for duty-free treatment for a variety of other products.
   SUPPLIES. Some $60 million would be earmarked for providing
critical agricultural supplies, petroleum and medical supplies.
   EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS. $10 million would help pay for ``emergency
employment programs,'' including ones designed to help turn
soliders into farmers.
   RESETTLEMENT. Some $45 million would go toward helping speed the
repatriation and resettlement of the U.S.-backed Contra forces and
other refugees, and an additional $1 million would be used for
technical assistance in restructuring the economy.
   INTERNATIONAL FINANCE. Some $50 million would be used to help
Nicaragua pay off debt to the International Monetary Fund and other
international financial institutions. An additional $75 million
would go toward helping to prop up the Nicaraguan currency to help
restructure the economy and aid the country with its
balance-of-payments imbalance.
   PROJECTS. About $60 million would help pay for such projects as
bridge, road and highay repair and refurbishing schools and
hospitals.
   FURTHER AID. Bush said he would later propose an additional $200
million to be used in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, with
details to be announced later

   Three Democrats waged a bare-fisted
struggle for the gubernatorial nomination in today's primary, while
a millionaire oilman making his first run for office was expected
to win the GOP nomination outright.
   The final pre-election poll showed former Gov. Mark White,
Attorney General Jim Mattox and Treasurer Ann Richards in a dead
heat for the Democratic nomination, with Clayton Williams gaining
more than half the Republican vote.
   Turnout was brisk this morning in Dallas and Fort Worth, and
fair in Houston, said officials at polling places. In El Paso,
voting was light in the first hour of balloting, said El Paso
County election clerk Robert Rodriguez.
   The secretary of state's office predicted a turnout of 2.1
million to 2.6 million of the 8.3 million eligible voters, who can
vote in either primary. Each party's choice needs more than 50
percent of the vote to avoid a runoff.
   Williams said if he wins outright and the Democrats are forced
into a runoff April 10, he will relax and ``have some fun watching
each of the Democrats murdering on each other.''
   The winner in November will succeed Republican Gov. Bill
Clements, who is retiring.
   Ms. Richards, known for her caustic keynote speech at the 1988
Democratic National Convention in which she said then-Vice
President Bush was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth,'' held a
slim lead in the latest poll.
   Mudslinging has been the mainstay of the Democratic campaign.
Ms. Richards accused her rivals of profiteering from public
service; they lashed out at her for refusing to say whether she has
used illegal drugs.
   Bush, who maintains a residence in Houston, told reporters in
Washington today that he voted in the Texas primary, and that he
felt a candidate's past drug use should not necessarily be held
against him or her.
   ``I think that's a matter for the voters to decide,'' Bush said.
``But in my view, if somebody used marijuana, some time ago, and is
not into anything of that nature, why, no, I don't think that
should be held against them.''
   In recent days, Ms. Richards questioned how White could afford
to move into a $1.3 million Houston estate after leaving the
governor's mansion in 1987.
   She attacked Mattox for accepting $200,000 in contributions from
Danny Faulkner, whose trial on charges of heading a scheme that
cost lending institutions $500 million ended in a hung jury.
   Mattox, campaigning Monday in the Dallas neighborhood where he
grew up, called Ms. Richards' charges ``scurrilous'' and said her
refusal to answer the drug questions had led her ``into a really
gutter-style campaign.''
   White said he would have challenged Ms. Richards to a fistfight
if she were a man. ``Everything she said is the greatest pack of
lies I've ever heard,'' he said.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has refused in three
debates to answer yes or no when asked if she'd used illegal drugs.
She said if she answered it might discourage people with drug
problems from seeking help.
   A Houston Chronicle-Dallas Morning News poll published Sunday
showed Richards favored by 28 percent of people who said they'd
vote Democrat. The poll gave Mattox 25 percent and White 24
percent. The margin of error was 4.5 points.
   Williams, who describes himself as ``just a country boy,''
warned his supporters against complacency after the final poll
showed him leading No. 2 Republican Kent Hance 55 percent to 13
percent. Two other GOP hopefuls _ Jack Rains of Houston and Dallas
lawyer Tom Luce _ received 8 percent each. The margin of error was
5 points.
   ``I've been talking about those guys getting lost in my dust. I
want to be sure our voters don't get lost in the dust,'' said
Williams. His $8 million, television-savvy campaign included nearly
$6 million from his own pocket.
   Voters were asked to choose nominees for dozens of other offices.
   In the U.S. Senate primary, Republican incumbent Phil Gramm was
unopposed, and state Sen. Hugh Parmer faced Harley Schlanger, a
follower of extremist Lyndon LaRouche, on the Democratic side.
   State GOP Chairman Fred Meyer said his party was focusing on the
Democrat-controlled Legislature, which will control redistricting
after the 1990 census. The census is expected to add three or four
seats to Texas' 27-member congressional delegation.

   Amtrak's northbound 19-car Silver Meteor, which runs from
Florida to New York City, was about to leave with 471 passengers
when it was hit at 1:23 a.m. by the engine pulling 96 freight cars,
said Amtrak spokeswoman Pat Duricka.
   All of the injured were aboard the passenger train, said Lindsay
Leckie, a spokesman for CSX Transporation, operator of the freight
locomotive.
   ``It slammed me into the seat in front of me and then threw me
back in my seat,'' said Mary Lou Henley of Lackawana, N.Y.
   Police Capt. Larry Wells said 31 people were treated at
hospitals and were discharged to continue their journey. ``Most
complaints were of back pain, neck injury and we had a few
nosebleeds,'' Wells said.
   Wells said that by late morning the track had been cleared and
rail service had resumed through the station.
   Three passenger coaches derailed but didn't turn over, Ms.
Duricka said from Amtrak headquarters in Washington.
   The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
   Leckie said he didn't know how fast the locomotive was going,
but one passenger said she had heard it was only mvoing at 3 mph.
   The passengers included college students returning from Florida
vacations and 22 members of a high school French club destined for
Canada from Red Springs.
   The club members from Flora McDonald Academy boarded the train
in Fayetteville, said headmistress Elma Averitte. One student
suffered whiplash but rejoined students on buses to New York, she
said.
   ``We just had a student who was terrified of train rides and we
assured her nothing would happen,'' Ms. Averitte said. ``We've got
another group leaving for London today, but they're flying.''
   ``It really wasn't that bad,'' said a 17-year-old member of the
group, who gave only his first name, Jonathan. ``The girls
freaked.''
   Leckie said there were no injuries to the three-man crew of the
switch train, a locomotive use to move freight cars around yard. He
said the cars were being taken to a siding for cleaning and
probably were empty.
   Most of the passengers boarded chartered buses en route to their
destinations or to Washington, where they could board northbound
trains, said Amtrak supervisor Sam Wilson.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Supreme Court Judge Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot was inaugurated by the army today to head Haiti's
first civilian-led government since the fall of dictator
Jean-Claude Duvalier in 1986.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot becomes the first woman president in the
Caribbean nation's tumultuous 186-year history. She was inaugurated
a day after military leader Lt. Gen. Propsper Avril, pressured by
widespread protests, resigned and left the country.
   The new president will serve with a 19-member advisory council
until after the country's first free elections, which could take
place in three to six months.
   ``I have accepted this heavy task in the name of Haitian
women,'' Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, who was the only woman on the 12-member
Supreme Court, was inaugurated by Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, the
army chief of staff, at the National Palace. The ceorse said.
   ``It's going better than we expected,'' Morse said. ``But we
don't want to unduly raise expectations.''
   The strike began last Wednesday in a dispute over wages and
benefits. Teachers stayed away from class Monday despite a warning
from the governor that they could be fired for striking in
violation of state law. No immediate disciplinary action was taken.
   Union leaders have said they won't go back to work until
Caperton calls a special legislative session to consider pay
raises; the governor said he won't consider calling a special
session until the teachers go back to work.
   In West Virginia, pay scales for teachers are set by the
Legislature.
   Caperton met with Kayetta Meadows, president of the
16,000-member West Virginia Education Assocation, and Bob Brown,
head of the 3,000-member West Virginia Federation of Teachers.
   Union officials said they had agreed not to discuss the content
of the talks.
   Caperton was to make a ``major policy address'' on education
tonight, his office said in a statement, but he postponed it until
Wednesday because of the talks with the teachers.
   Pickets spread to 46 of the state's 55 counties Monday. The
Department of Education said schools were closed today in 25
counties, open in 19 and mixed in 11 others. The number of teachers
and students affected was not immediately available, said education
spokeswoman Carolyn Spangler, but on Monday the strike idled nearly
150,000 of the state's 328,000 public school students. About 3,000
of the state's teachers are not unionized.
   Teachers picketed in shorts and T-shirts throughout the state,
which enjoyed a sunny, 80-degree day.
   At Charleston's Capitol High School, only about 400 of the
school's 1,300 students showed up. ``We've been wasting our time,''
said Shawna Adkins, a sophomore. ``All we do is watch movies, and
we can do that at home.''
   Outside Caperton's office, Keith Geiger, president of the
National Education Association, addressed about 1,000 teachers.
   ``This isn't fun, but it is necessary,'' said Geiger, whose
union is the parent of the WVEA. ``You must stick together until a
resolution is there. It is not the time for individual decisions on
how you should operate.''
   West Virginia teachers average about $21,900 per year, less than
in any state except Arkansas and South Dakota, according to the
National Education Association.
   In Ohio County in the northern panhandle, classes were canceled
after it was discovered most of the district's 47 buses had flat
tires, said Superintendent H. Lawrence Jones. He said it was
unclear who was responsible.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ...that much.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: My Nicaragua question is, you are not proposing to Congress
exactly where to cut in the defense budget, you're basically
leaving that to them. Why don't you tell them where they should cut
specifically?
   A: On offsets?
   Q: Yes.
   A: From the defense budget?
   Q: Why don't you say, ``Here's a B-2, take it and'' _
   A: We are, we are doing that. And what I'm saying to them is _
   Q: Where?
   A: Well, that's in negotiation up there. But what I've also said
here is, ``If you're not willing to do it, give me the authority on
March 27 and it'll be done like that.'' I am willing to do it.
   Q: Where?
   A: We're going to take the hits. We're negotiating with Congress
now.
   Q: Why not tell the American people?
   A: We'll tell them on March 27, if they turn it to me. And right
now, I don't know how much of it's confidential, but I'll let the
Secretary of Defense answer the question. But we're _ there's _ I
don't see any great secrecy in this. What we're trying to do is to
give the Congress the ball and say, ``Here's what we recommend.
Now, you, you know, tell us what you want to do, but don't go
making a lot of add-ons. Do it the way we feel is necessary to keep
the focus on Nicaragua and Panama.''
   I think Congress has a very legitimate role here. But if they're
not willing to fulfill it _ Lesley, we have no problem giving you a
list that would take care of it just like that, but I think it's
the Congress's role now to work with our people.
   Q: Why does Gephardt get under your skin so much? You've got an
_ I don't know _ 80 percent approval rating. He makes a speech
attacking you, and _
   A: Well, what have I said? Now what would make you think _
(laughter) _ that he gets under my skin?
   Q: Well, he says you're not a strong leader _
   A: Oh, I know _
   Q: _ and all the people around you at the White House _
   A: I know, that's so discouraging, but what _ (laughter) _ but
what _ (with a laugh) _ but why do you think it gets under my skin?
   Q: (Off mike.)
   A: The honest answer is _ I know you won't believe this _ it
doesn't. It doesn't. I think we're going in the right direction.
We're talking substance and policy. I think the _ many in the
Congress think that we are being responsive. But look, I expect
that, I expect that kind of political criticism. But I think if you
want to talk about the substance of his ideas, do I think it's a
good idea to loan money to the Soviet Union today? No. We have no
request for food aid to the Soviet Union _ do you just want to put
it on a ship and send it over there? No, I don't think that's a
particularly brilliant idea. But I don't want to knock the man,
maybe he'll come upon a good idea one of these days. Yeah?
(Laughter.)
   Q: The Nicaraguans and the Panamanians are expecting aid very
soon. They are in urgent need of the aid _
   A: Exactly.
   Q: _ and the Panamanians say that they cannot wait any longer.
What can you do besides Congress? When can they expect something?
   A: I'm going to have this question replayed on Capitol Hill,
because you're absolutely right, there is a sense of urgency. And I
would like to take the opportunity here to encourage the movement
in the Congress. We sent a proposal up on Panama. Now let's get
going on it. Now we are coupling it with Nicaragua. Now let's going
on it. The _ there is an urgency in Nicaragua, too. But Panama?
Very urgent. And so we are going to _ we're going to keep _ keep
pushing. But I think you are right on target with that hypothesis.
Yes?

   A ``white wall'' of fog and paper-mill
smoke was blamed for a flaming, 52-vehicle pileup that killed three
people and injured 30.
   ``It was just horrible, terrible. To hear the brakes squeal, the
gas tanks explode, to hear the people screaming,'' said Harry
Suppanz, 35, of Sturgeon Bay, a passenger in a truck that crashed
and burned Monday morning.
   The chain-reaction collision took place on the Tower Drive
Bridge, which carries Interstate 43 over the Fox River.
   Police Lt. Bob Boncher said an unprecedented combination of fog
and smoke from three paper mills created a 100-foot-long ``white
wall'' that reduced visibility to less than 10 feet.
   ``It was just like driving into a milk bottle,'' said fire Capt.
Rolland Becker.
   Boncher said the crash started at 6:48 a.m. when two cars and a
truck apparently slowed down because the drivers could not see once
they hit the cloud. Crashes continued for 3 to 5 minutes before the
smoke and fog lifted.
   ``Five minutes after I got there, you could see plain as day,''
Boncher said.
   Investigators said the combination of fog and smoke has never
before occurred on the bridge, which opened in 1980.
   The line of smashed cars stretched about 450 feet.
   ``There were tires exploding and occasionally a gas tank was
blowing,'' Becker said.
   Deputy Traffic Chief Robert Kreuser said more cars than normal
would have been on the bridge because one of the city's four other
spans over the Fox River was closed for repairs. He said the closed
bridge normally carries 20,000 vehicles a day.
   The victims were killed in separate cars and were in the middle
of the pileup, said Brown County Coroner Genie Williams
   ``I couldn't believe it when I saw only three did die,'' she
said. ``It was amazing that many people got out.''
   Police Capt. Larry Gille today said the victims had been
identified as Jennie M. Strnad, 20, of Green Bay; Susan M. Chriske,
40, of Green Bay; and Terrance I. Mellberg, 40, of Manitowoc.

   A blind man who handed a threatening note
to a bank teller and collected $105 was arrested after he asked her
to help him leave the building, police said.
   She refused. And 27-year-old Jeffery Lee Flournoy was taken into
custody Monday by police who waited outside the busy downtown Bank
of America branch in this northern California city.
   He was booked on suspicion of robbery.
   ``The first thing he asked is, `Are you the police?''' Lt.
Reginald Garcia said.
   The branch manager called police while Flournoy, wearing dark
glasses and using a cane, was in the bank. Garcia said the note to
the teller read, ``I have a bomb so give me your money or the bomb
goes off.''
   There was no bomb. Flournoy made no attempt to flee when
confronted by police.
   ``I think it really was his intention to get caught. As he was
being led away, he said he had done it to publicize the plight of
the homeless and handicapped,'' Garcia said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The servant of a socialite who helps raise funds
to benefit AIDS patients says he was fired after contracting the
disease, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   For seven years, Tony Deleu worked as a cook, butler and maid
for Frances Scaife in her 19-room co-op apartment on Manhattan's
East Side, the New York Post reported.
   In a lawsuit filed last week in Manhattan Criminal Court, Deleu,
47, charged that Scaife sacked him once she found out he had been
diagnosed with AIDS.
   Deleu charged that Scaife never paid into his health or
unemployment insurance fund, leaving him destitute. He is seeking
$1.5 million in damages and expenses.
   Mrs. Scaife's attorney, Jay Cohen, denied Deleu's charges.
   ``The claim she fired him over AIDS is baseless,'' Cohen said.
``She didn't know he had AIDS. She let him go because he couldn't
perform his duties.''
   Mrs. Scaife, 55, is the estranged wife of Richard Mellon Scaife,
an heir to the Mellon family fortune.
   She is listed in the Social Register, is a friend of first lady
Barbara Bush, and serves on a committee of the Pittsburgh AIDS
Taskforce, the newspaper said.

according to a plan presented Tuesday to Premier Michel Rocard.
   Chartres Deputy Mayor Georges Lemoine said after meeting with
Rocard that the museum would feature exhibits dealing with

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, last week, we learned that you were so
concerned about the hostages that you were willing to take a
questionable call, and it might have been from the Iranian
president, and then, of course, you found out it wasn't. In
response, Rafsanjani made a statement saying that you have been
trying to get a hold of him for a month. Did you actually then try
to place a call t the real person, or could you clarify _
   A: I don't know where he got that. I saw that statement, and it
was _ it was _ there were no truth in it. Our trying to contact him
for a month _ it'd be very easy to do. I responded to an incoming
call. I think the bottom-line is, you have to say, would you do it
again based on the information you had? And I'd say, yeah, I
probably would. It may be difficult for somebody to get through
again, but _ (laughter) _ but what's wrong with reaching out and
touching someone when the hostages are at stake? The hostages are
at stake here, and what's wrong with trying? And I _ look, I feel
this all the time. I've talked about this, that I will go the extra
mile. And when the whole story comes out on this, you all are going
to be very, very fascinated with the details, very fascinated.
   Q: Tell us!
   Q: What is _
   A: But I'm just telling you that it is important _ it is very
important to run down every avenue in terms of these hostages, and
I would be remiss if I didn't. And there are things that go on,
going around in back alleys and trying to find out information, and
we've got to do that. I owe it to the families of those people and
to those people themselves that are held hostage.
   Q: Can I follow up, Mr. President?
   A: Yeah.
   Q: If you didn't try to reach him for a month, can you say
whether you or anyone acting on your behalf did try to reach him at
all?
   A: Have we been trying to reach Rafsanjani?
   Q: Have you tried, yes?
   A: No, other than this one _ one phone call that turns out to be
a hoax.
   Q: So, as far as you can tell, what he was saying just didn't
make any sense?
   A: Yeah, it's very much like the rhetoric that they use from
time to time. He's got some political problems at home, and we
understand that. The main thing is can we move forward and get the
hostages out. And I will repeat, good will begets good will. And I
think that _ I think that I am satisfied that even in this instance
the officials there know that nobody is trying to set them up or
anything of that nature. I am interested in saving American lives.
   Q: Mr. President, I understand that TASS is reporting this
morning this morning that the Soviet Parliament has granted
President Gorbachev the expanded powers he wants and has been
requesting. I am interested, sir, if you side with those within the
Soviet Union who fear that there are not sufficient checks and
balances on this new presidential system, that it could result in a
more totalitarian Soviet Union? How do you feel this might affect
your dealings with Gorbachev and whether you envision extending
this fund for democracy, perhaps one day, to the Soviet Union
itself?
   A: I speak _ I answer that by saying I stay out of the internal
affairs and deliberations of the Soviet Union. And they are going
through a process of reform, which we support in broad terms,
perestroika. They are going through a process of glasnost, which is
openness, which we support. And it would be very inappropriate for
the President of the United States to start passing judgment as
that process of perestroika, democratization, if you will, moves
forward. And so, yes, the Soviets have created a new post of
president, I hear, but that's their business. And we will work with
the _ in this instance, President Gorbachev. As you know, I think
we have a reasonably good relationship there, respectful one, and
I'm going to continue to work with him.
   Q: Can you say, sir, whether you think that as you continue to
work with him, that will be affected in any way by these changes
that have taken place or is it going to be as it has been between
you and Mr. Gorbachev, and would you see involving the Soviet Union
in this Fund For Democracy?
   A: Involving, you mean asking them to give money to _
   Q: No, no, no, no, no. Including them, making them _ if not
currently, as Gephardt has suggested _ perhaps one day a
beneficiary of this Fund For Democracy.

   A: I think the answer is to help in a technical way as best we
can for moving _ helping the Soviets move towards market economies
and free markets and those kinds of consideration. I think that's
the next step we ought to take. And I _ you know, there's
discussion of an Eastern Development Bank. The question is out
there whether the Soviets should be members of that bank or not,
and as a matter of fact, we have some deliberations going on as to
what the U.S. position should be right now. I'm not prepared to
state it, but I've been spending some time on this question.
   But it's _ that's an idea that was surfaced by Francois
Mitterrand, I believe. So there are all kinds of ways in which down
the road we could work with the Soviet Union. But I think what they
need now from us is know-how and technical knowledge, that kind of
thing. Yeah, Dave?
   Q: Mr. President, after your meeting in Palm Springs with Prime
Minister Kaifu, he took a real beating in the Japanese Diet, and I
wonder if in retrospect, were there any misunderstandings in your
conversations? He was accused in Japan by his critics of having
made some concessions or reached a level of detail in your
discussions that some in Japan were unhappy with. Could you _ is
there any clarification needed about what came out of Palm Springs?
   A: You know what? I think those reports just highlight the
sensitivity of the situation in Japan and I think as far as I'm
concerned the talks were very good. We followed up, incidentally,
with close to an hour with Mr. Takeshita yesterday and covered the
same broad agenda. I didn't go into every specific, but I'm
convinced that both Mr. Kaifu left Palm Springs and Takeshita will
leave Washington with a far better understanding of the problems
that we face. And hopefully, I have a better understanding of
theirs. So I think I'm aware of the criticism against him at home,
but I think that I would just go back to the statements he made
when he left Palm Springs, which I viewed as very constructive.
   Q: Just one followup. You said in a speech the day after you got
back to the Electronics Association that you had discussed
telecommunications with him, and that apparently came as a surprise
to some people in Japan. Was that a brief discussion, a lengthy one?
   A: A broad discussion of several categories and the only _ I
don't know in terms of the amount of time, but all these were _ we
left the details of all of these categories that are so well-known
as differences between the US and Japan to the experts. In fact, I
think Bob Mosbacher will be going there soon, if he's not already
on his way. And so it was more broad in general but categories
mentioned, yes.
   Q: Do you still expect the summit with Mr. Gorbachev will take
place in Washington the last two weeks of June?
   A: We've got to get that set soon in terms of pin down the dates
and the place. But in terms of expectation, yes. Ellen?
   Q: Mr. President, the announcement no one wants to hear, the
delay of baseball's opening day is imminent. Is there anything that
you as the ``First Fan'' can do _ (laughter) _ to bring the sides
closer together to prevent a tragic delay of the baseball season?
   A: You know, I made a comment on that yesterday and I misspoke,
because I said, ``strike,'' and we, understandably, got some calls
from some of the ballplayers saying, ``Hey. That's not technically
what the situation is, please.'' Yes, I'm a ball fan and I want to
go to the opening game someplace. Last year I went to the American
League. This year I would like to the National League, if possible.
I don't know whether it's going to work, maybe going to end up in
Baltimore.
   But I want to see _ I don't want to intervene _ we've already
taken a battle on that up there on another labor matter _ have the
federal government intervene. But I would simply appeal to both
sides to get the matter resolved so the American people can hear
that cry, ``Play ball again.'' Yeah, Ellen?

   Anatoli Karpov and Jan Timman
adjourned their fourth game Tuesday in the World Chess Championship
Candidates Final match after 61 moves.
   The two players will resume play Thursday with Timman to move.
   Grandmasters analyzing the game were divided in their assessment
of the position. Ian Rogers of Australia believed Timman, playing
black, was in a better position, but Im Ligterink and Grandmaster
Oleg Romanishin said it was unclear.
   Karpov's second believed Timman had a slight advantage after 30
moves. The position was so complex that Karpov was in serious time
trouble after 51 moves.
   The players had to make 40 moves each in the first two hours and
another 20 moves in an hour. Although they managed to meet the two
time controls, experts believe the players missed the best possible
continuations.
   In the opening, the two grandmasters followed the Gruenfeld
Defense, which they played in the second game.
   Karpov varied on move 9 by castling, instead of moving Bg5. This
was seen as an improvement from the second game and Timman had to
defend a very difficult position.
   But the Dutch grandmaster managed to equalize on move 25 when he
put his pawn on e5, offering a pawn on the d-file. Karpov declined,
apparently thinking it too dangerous to accept the sacrifice.
   The winner of this match will move on to meet Garri Kasparov for
the world title in Lyons, France in October.
   Karpov leads the series 2-1, having won the first game and drawn
games 2 and 3. Karpov and Timman are to play a 12-game match. The
winner will be the first player to reach a score of 6{ points.
   For Wednesday's game 5, Timman will play white.

<TEXT>
   Q: I have a follow-up here, sir. I'm reminded by one of the
senior correspondents back here _
   A: Uh-huh.
   Q: _ (laughter) _ that Lyndon Johnson used to lock up both sides
and say, ``Don't come out until you've got a settlement.'' Is that
a prospect here?
   A: Not on this particular issue, but on some issues that could
well prove to be a prospect. Yeah, Kathy?
   Q: Mr. President, have you been in contact with President Endara
about his fast? And do you view that as a useful means of
expressing the plight of the Panamanian people as they wait _
   A: Well, I have not talked to him since the fast began, and I
did note with interest some very supportive statements out of him
after the fast began, supportive of our administration and what
we're trying to do. But that's a matter for him to determine. Yeah?
   Q: How can you _ (off mike) _
   Q: Mr. President, in your opening statement, you _ in your
opening statement, you appealed to Congress to pass your aid
program, but you did not appeal to the American people. And one of
the problems a lot of congressmen say they're having is that
foreign aid at this time is not a high priority for a lot of
people. What do you _ do you think an appeal, first of all, to
ordinary Americans is necessary? And what do you say to people who
think that perhaps what may be seen as the first part of a peace
dividend is going overseas?
   A: I think you put your finger on a good point. However, I
believe that both Nicaragua and Panama have strong support from the
American people. In fact, there's new information on that. But I
think they raise a good point. I mean, there's a lot of domestic
problems. But we're sorting this out now, and I am convinced that
when the American people understand what we're talking about about
offsetting proposals in defense _ in other words, not going in
there and costing them more or taking it away from some other
program, that it will have strong support. But I'm not _ I'm not
unsympathetic to that argument, but where I would differ is I think
the American people would strongly support what we're saying here.
I think they see a lot at stake for us in a totally democratic
hemisphere and the success of democracy in Nicaragua.
   Q: Do you feel we particularly owe it to the people of those two
countries, given our military activities in both Nicaragua and
Panama?
   A: Do we owe _ do we owe support?
   Q: Do we owe money?
   A: I don't think _ I think we're _ well, we've lifted the
embargos and we've released the funds; so to the degree there's
anything owed, we're trying to comply with that. But what I'm
proposing here is an investment in democracy. I don't think anybody
would say _ you know, argue _ have the American people try to
believe that we owe it. But it's the right thing to do. And we want
to see Violeta Chamorro supported and we want to see the Panamanian
democracy succeed. So, that's the way I'd phrase it.
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Let me ask you about one _
   Q: Mr. President _
   A: I have a meeting with the Congress at 10:45, and I don't want
to get _ I mean 9:45. 9:45. Sorry, accept the correction, please.
   Q: It's primary day in Texas, Mr. President. Can you tell us two
questions? One _
   A: Now we're talking. (Laughter.)
   Q: _ for whom you voted in the Republican primary. And, number
two, do you think it should be held against a candidate if perhaps
at some point in the past they used drugs, but no longer? You've
talked on that issue before. Can you go back over it for us?
   A: This is election day in Texas. I did vote in the Texas
Republican primary. I will not tell you who I voted for. I hope
everybody understands. Otherwise, we'd have a quiz around here of
who we voted for earlier on. It's not a proper question to _ to

   Q: But on the drugs issue, which is an issue in the primary and
certainly may be in the general election, do you think it should be
held against a candidate that at some point in the past they have
used drugs?
   A: I think that's a matter for the voters to decide, but in

not into anything of that nature, why, no, I don't think that

treaty in a number of instances in East Germany. Do you think that
that could throw a monkey wrench into the CFE and START talks?
   A: To the degree that there are differences on verification on
INF, we've got to work those out. And we've got our experts working
the problem and trying to eliminate any differences.
   Q: What about the differences reported between Secretary Cheney
and CIA Director Webster over the threat assessment if _
   A: Just a minute.
   Q: _ in the event that Gorbachev is thrown from power?
   A: Just one minute on that one. As I have said before _
(laughter and the president laughs) _ I don't see any real
disagreement here. (Laughter.) No _ (laughs) _ I tried to answer
that yesterday and I expect I didn't _ didn't lay it to rest. But I
don't think anybody believes, including Cheney, that the Soviet
system is going to go back to where it was in _ you know, before
1980 and the middle of the '80s.
   But there are differences when you go to try to predict with
accuracy, based on intentions. And so, I've talked to them now and
I feel that they are pretty close together. And I _ it's difficult
when you have a fast changing world and yet you take a position
like I do: We must retain a credible defense. Then, you get into a
big debate, well what is ``credible,'' and I think that's what you
are seeing here.
   So, I can tell you, having talked to these gentlemen, I don't
think that there is this enormous defense difference between the
intelligence community _ and I say ``community,'' or _ and the
Secretary. I think we have come up with a prudent, well thought out
defense plan. And there will be changes, I am sure, after our
cooperation with and consultation with Congress. But, believe me,
these are not diametrically different views that you are reading
about.
   Q: Mr. President?
   A: Shall we end with this one? I really do have a 9:45.
   Q: Mr. President, here is a question that I please wish you
would decide and I think only you can. You're going to have to deal
with billions and billions of surplus weapons. What are you going
to do with those? There has been some indication that you have
already given 1,000 tanks from Europe, out of that surplus, to
Egypt. If you keep on giving these _ and selling them on credit,
these arms that we have, you're going to keep on creating wars in
the Third World and other nations.
   A: One of the _
   Q: Mr. President, would you do this at the microphone?
   A: Right here? This is a depart _ (laughter). One of the things
that is part of the negotiations on CFE is destruction of weapons,
and so that is _ and we're talking about significant numbers. And I
had a meeting yesterday with Jim Woolsey, our CFE negotiator, and
he was spelling out for me just the mechanical difficulties of
doing this. But, nevertheless, we are determined that that will be
the approach that's taken with these massive numbers of weapons. We
still have security needs that we feel are enhanced by transfer of
military equipment, sales of military equipment to friendly
countries. But, we're _ so the policy will remain as it is, but we
will go forward with the destruction where that is a part of the
policy.
   Thank you all very much. Thank you.

   The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies today
approved Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan for a stronger presidency, a
post the Soviet leader says is essential to hold the country
together as his reforms go forward.
   The Congress, the country's top legislative body, also scrapped
the clauses of the constitution that guarantee the Communist
Party's leading role in society, which would create a multiparty
system. It also legalized private ownership of factories.
   ``We are standing before the greatest, most meaningful step in
the history of our government,'' Gorbachev told the parliament.
   ``This is the first step toward a Western political system,''
said deputy Fyodor Burlatsky.
   Later today, the deputies were expected to nominate Gorbachev to
a four-year term as president, then decide whether the Congress or
the public would elect the new president.
   It is expected that after the initial four years, the term would
become five years and the president would be popularly elected.
   The lawmakers approved the measure on the presidency by a vote
of 1,817 to 133, with 61 abstentions, the official Tass news agency
said. A two-thirds majority of the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies was required for the motion to pass.
   Deputies broke into applause when the bill passed.
   The measures on the presidency had earlier been approved by the
Supreme Soviet, the smaller parliament that handles day-to-day
business, after making significant alterations.
   The vote on scrapping the party's leading role passed in the
Congress by a vote of 1,771 to 164, with 74 abstentions.
   Gorbachev has argued the more powerful presidency is needed to
keep the Soviet Union intact as he presses ahead with his reforms
while facing a crumbling economy and growing independence movements.
   Lithuanians had been so dismayed by the proposal on the more
powerful presidency that they rushed to declare independence before
it passed on Sunday. Estonia, Latvia and Georgia have all taken
moves in that direction.
   His victory on the proposal came despite a boycott by a group of
progressive deputies worried about placing too much power in the
hands of one person in a country with a history of dictatorship.
   The vote on the presidency bill also was boycotted by
representatives of several independence-minded republics, who said
the president would be too strong for the loose federation of
independent nations they see as the future Soviet Union.
   Abstaining had the same effect as voting no, because Gorbachev
was struggling to put together the two-thirds majority needed for
constitutional amendments.
   To succeed today, Gorbachev backed off some demands that had
disturbed legislators from some republics, who felt he would have
too much power. Those demands included the president's right to
declare on his own a state of emergency and to suspend the
parliaments of the republics.
   The presidency bill creates a chief executive who can propose
legislation, veto laws passed by the Supreme Soviet legislature,
declare war or martial law, and overrule cabinet members. Vice
President Anatoly Lukyanov said Monday it also clearly separates
executive and legislative powers for the first time.
   The historic change in Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution
drops language defining the Communist Party as the ``leading and
guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political
system, of all state organizations and public organizations.''
   The new article reads, ``The Communist Party of the Soviet
Union, other party, trade union and youth organizations, other
social organizations and mass movements, shall participate, through
their representatives elected to the Soviets of People's Deputies
as well as in other ways, in shaping the policies of the Soviet
state and in running the state and social affairs.''
   An effort to drop the words ``Communist Party'' from the article
entirely received 1,067 votes in favor to 906 against but fell
short of the necessary two-thirds majority.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev said a legislative commission was
studying the Lithuanian independence declaration and that he would
consider the status quo not to have changed ``until the entire
situation is cleared up.''
   ``We welcome the fact that deputies from all the republics,
including Lithuania, are in attendance,'' he said.
   On Monday, another member of the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo, Yegor K. Ligachev, said Moscow would not use force in
Lithuania.
   Soviet Vice President Anatoly Lukyanov introduced the latest
draft of the presidency proposal Monday by promising, ``There is no
reason to believe that the institution of the presidency would lead
to alleged authoritarian power.''
   Lukyanov said the bill creates checks and balances between the
executive and legislative branches of power. He said it allows
Congress to recall the president for breaking the law and restricts
the passage of legislation to the Congress and the Supreme Soviet,
the standing legislature.
   The current constitution allows the leadership of the Supreme
Soviet _ which Gorbachev heads _ to issue decrees.
   Throughout Monday, deputies huddled with Gorbachev and each
other seeking compromises.
   Several of the independence-oriented republics have adopted
constitutional amendments allowing them to suspend Soviet laws on
their territory.
   Gorbachev supporter Sergei Alexeyev argued that the Soviet Union
is ``in a paralysis of power,'' and ``the presidency is the only
way to transfer the real power from the (Communist) party to the
government.''
   If the presidency issue is resolved positively, ``we can get
down to drafting a new constitution immediately which will confirm
human rights, democracy and conversion to a market economy,''
Alexeyev said.
   But Yuri Afanasyev, a leader of a group of progressive deputies,
urged that the presidency be adopted only in conjunction with a new
constitution, direct election of the president, real opposition
parties and freedom of the press.

   A predawn fire that drove back would-be
rescuers killed five young children on the second floor of their
apartment while horrified neighbors in their housing project
watched helplessly.
   ``That little boy was standing in the window. He was burning and
he was yelling, `Help me, Help me,' said neighbor Angela Briggs.
``He was beating on the window.''
   The Somerset Circle apartments fire was reported at 2:34 a.m. by
a passing Town of Madison police officer who attempted to enter the
unit but was driven back by smoke, heat and fire, said Police Chief
Wayne Romeis.
   Residents of the rent-subsidized complex also tried to enter the
apartment.
   ``There were a couple the officers had to physically restrain
from going in,'' Romeis said.
   Firefighters entered the burning townhouse and carried out the
children but could not revive them, officials said.
   Lysundra Alawiye said the children lived with their 28-year-old
mother, Cheryl Robinson. ``They were very nice kids,'' she said.
   The victims, all brothers and sisters, included Derek Robinson,
9; Kenneth Jones, 5; Ebony Robinson, about 3; Mark Robinson, an
infant; and an unidentified girl, age 20 months.
   Police did not know whether any adults were in the apartment
before the fire broke out. Romeis said the mother refused to give
officers a statement.
   Town of Madison Fire Chief Keith Tveit said the fire apparently
began in a kitchen at the rear of the apartment and engulfed the
first floor. Firefighters brought the fire under control in about
90 minutes, Tveit said.
   The fire destroyed the end apartment of the building's six
two-story units. Tveit, who estimated damage at $75,000, said a
fire wall prevented the blaze from spreading, but there was smoke
and water damage to the adjacent unit.
   Romeis said local authorities and the state fire marshal were
investigating the cause of the fire.
   Max Uttech, director of public works for the town of Madison,
said the building had been inspected in recent weeks by his
department and by the Dane County housing authority, and no
violations were reported.
   Tveit said town records showed smoke alarms in the complex were
working when they were inspected by Dane County officials Feb. 8.
He said fire officials did not immediately know if they worked
today.

<TEXT>
   The Central Committee of Mongolia's
Communist Party met late into the night on Tuesday as a record
number of members vied to make speeches on proposed sweeping
political changes.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tepbishiin Chimeddorj said most of
the Central Commmitee's more than 120 members had lined up to make
speeches, forcing its special plenary session into overtime.
   The meeting, which began Monday, was expected to continue
through Wednesday and possibly even Thursday.
   The committee is expected to ratify the ruling Politburo's
decisions Monday to abolish the party's constitutional guarantee on
power, replace the Politburo and party General Secretary Jambyn
Batmonh, hold early legislative elections and write a new
constitution.
   Chimeddorj said reformists and conservatives in the leadership
were debating the dramatic moves, and those in favor far exceeded
opponents.
   Mongolia's fledgling opposition groups, whose demonstrations
since January accelerated this pastoral country's retreat from
Stalinist-style communism, held separate meetings Tuesday to plan
strategies and improve their organization in preparation for the
expected legislaltive elections.
   ``We have a lot of work to do,'' said Nandad Orkmon, a member of
the executive committee of thte Social Democrat movement. ``I am
studying right now the American system. I have some English books
and I am also studying the systems of other Western countries.
Still, we don't understand exactly how they work.''
   The Social Democrats, along with Mongolia's two other opposition
parties _ the Mongolian Democratic Party and the National
Progressive Party that was formed only Tuesday _ said it was too
early to name candiates for the legislature or presidency.
   Another Social Democrat leader, R. Gonchigdorz, said it was
impossible to analyze what was going in inside the closed Central
Committee meeting of the ruling party.
   Some opposition party members suggested it was only the aging
members of the ruling Communist Party who were dragging their feet
on reform. However, none was able to identify these members by name.
   The internal workings of the party have been secret for so many
decades that nobody is sure how the factions are lined up, they
said.
   Chimeddorj has said it too soon to give details on what form the
new national leadership would take.
   Chimeddorj said Central Committee members had been arguing
behind closed doors about the reform proposals and ``practically
nobody'' opposed them.
   ``In general, we can say in the Central Committee there are
radicals and conservatives. They are arguing, but the viewpoints of
the conservatives also are changing.''
   The Social Democrats and other opposition parties are pressing
for legislative elections to be held in June or July.
   Chimeddorj said the Central Committee was considering whether to
ask the legislature, the Great People's Hural, to hold a vote of
confidence on Batmonh, who also is president, and Premier Dumaagiyn
Sodnom.
   Both the New Progressives and Social Democrats expressed support
for Batmonh continuing as president during what they referred to as
a transition period, during which democratic institutions are to be
established.
   A small group of members of the official Communist Party's youth
league held a small demonstration Tuesday outside the league's
headquarters. Speakers said they opposed the youth league's close
ties with the party.
   About 200 people listened to the hour-long rally, but there was
little applause.
   One demonstrator, a student who identified himself only as
Batbold, said, ``all the young students and workers want radical
reform in the youth league, but the league's Central Committee
wants only to change the name.''
   He said he and many other youth league members planned to turn
in their membership cards and form an alternative youth
organization.

   President Bush today lifted a five-year trade
embargo against Nicaragua and asked Congress to provide $300
million quickly to help speed the transition to democracy. He said
the funds should come from the Pentagon budget.
   Bush also renewed his call for $500 million in assistance to
Panama, where an American invasion force installed a new government
last December. He said both Central American nations ``need our
help to heal deep wounds'' after years of political and economic
struggle.
   Bush's 45-minute news conference coincided with a vote by the
Soviet Congress granting Mikhail Gorbachev stronger powers as
president. Bush said it would be ``very inappropriate'' for him to
pass judgment on the process of reform in the Soviet Union.
   It was the first time in 10 days that Bush had met with
reporters, and in fielding numerous questions, he said:
   _He remains opposed to higher taxes and Social Security
limitations to eliminate the budget deficit. But he said he was
``prepared to negotiate'' with congressional Democrats over a
deficit-cutting plan.
   _``Every president'' wants to see interest rates lower, but he
denied the existence of a ``bubbling war'' with Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve.
   _He was disappointed that the Communist government in China has
not made progress toward democratic reforms but said ``I have no
regrets'' about the administration's China policy.
   _Appealed to major league owners and ball players to settle
their labor dispute ``so the American people can hear that cry
`play ball' again.''
   _Said a long-ago use of marijuana shouldn't disqualify a
political candidate. The question arose in the context of a
political flap in Texas where Ann Richards, who is seeking the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, has refused to say whether she
ever used illegal drugs.
   Bush also showed his zest for political combat when he said of
House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt, a frequent critic, ``I
don't want to knock the man. Maybe he'll come up with a good idea
one of these days.''
   Bush was asked about the telephone call he held several days go
with the man who he thought _ incorrectly _ was Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani. The president admitted it was a ``hoax,'' but
said, ``What's wrong with reaching out and touching someone.''
   ``The hostages are at stake,'' he said.
   Bush said things are going on in ``back alleys'' involving the
fate of the eight American hostages. He stressed his determination
to do all he could to free them. The longest held hostage,
Associated Press reporter Terry Anderson, will mark his fifth
anniversary in captivity on Friday.
   The president opened his news conference by announcing that he
had lifted the five-year trade embargo that former President Reagan
had imposed against the Sandinista government of Daniel Ortega.
   Ortega was defeated in last month's elections by opposition
candidate Violetta Chamorro. Ortega told Vice President Dan Quayle
in Chile on Monday that he would abide by the results of the
elections and permit an orderly transition to democracy.
   Bush called for creation of a ``Fund for Democracy'' to assist
Nicaragua and Panama.
   He also said he will seek an additional $200 million in economic
assistance for Nicaragua in fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
The $300 million would be for immediate use.
   Bush afterwards briefed Republican congressional leaders on his
aid package. Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., chairman of the House
GOP Research Committee, said the president expressed concern on
getting the U.S. aid to those who need it the most.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said $81 million of
the money for Nicaragua would come from deferral of construction at
bases being considered for closing, $83 million from a freeze of
civilian personnel of the department, $11 million from cancellation
of repair work on the turret of the USS Iowa, $69 million from
savings due to improvements in the engines of KC-135 airplanes, $30
million from delay in submitting an anti-submarine warfare package,
$18 million from not going ahead immediately with a proposed mobile
armored reconaissance vehicle, and $9 million from an abandoned
plan for replacement of NATO frigates.
   The president never mentioned the Contras, the rebels who
received millions of dollars from the United States during the
Reagan administration. But his aid request includes about $45
million to help pay costs of relocating some 10,000 Contra rebels
and tens of thousands of family members from camps along the
Honduran border to homes inside Nicaragua.
   Bush urged Congress to speed the aid on its way by April 5 and
to assist the administration in identifying Pentagon programs that
could absorb the needed reductions ``without having an unacceptable
impact on national security.''
   At another point, however, he said he was prepared to submit a
list of suggested Pentagon cuts on his own. ``It will be done like
that,'' he said, snapping his fingers for emphasis.
   Bush's plan for aid to Panama has been bogged down in Congress
over the issue of which programs would lose money to finance the
assistance.
   Bush called Mrs. Chamorro on Monday to brief her about the aid
package, a source said.
   The president paid tribute to the extraordinary worldwide move
toward democracy in 1989, and said the drive for freedom ``leaves
us with a new challenge, how best to support newborn democracies.''
   ``These nations need our help to heal deep wounds,'' he said.
   On other topics, Bush responded with a blunt ``no'' when asked
whether he would freeze Social Security benefits or raise taxes to
reduce the federal deficit. A senior House Democrat made such
proposals last weekend as part of a comprehensive deficit-cutting
plan.
   Bush said his administration had an encouraging response to the
plan by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., because it showed ``evident
goodwill.'' He said that despite his distaste for some specifics,
he was ``prepared to negotiate'' with Congress to reduce the
deficit.
   ``There's a lot of things that I'm not for that are in his
proposal. A lot including taxes,'' the president said.
   Asked if the administration would recognize a drive for
independence by the Soviet Republic of Lithuania, Bush said, ``We
want to see the evolution of the control of the territory there.''
   Bush said the Soviet Union had not requested direct U.S. aid and
he criticized Gephardt for proposing such assistance.
   Responding to Gephardt's criticism that he was running an
administration guided by public opinion polls, Bush said, ``I don't
want to knock the man. Maybe he'll come up with a good idea one of
these days.''
   On a sensitive economic issue, Bush also declined to be drawn
into speculation about whether he would reappoint Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, whose term expires next year. Some
members of the administration have said Federal Reserve concerns
about inflation have kept interest rates relatively high.
   ``Look, every president would like to see interest rates lower,
there's no question,'' Bush said. ``There's no bubbling war with
Alan Greenspan.'' He said such disputes over economic policy are
common in every administration.
   Asked about the major league baseball dispute, Bush said, ``Yes
I'm a ball fan and I want to go to the opening game some place,''
he said. But he quickly added he didn't want to have the federal
government intervene'' in the decision by owners to lock players
out of spring training camps.
   Even before Bush formally unveiled the Nicaragua aid package,
there was support in Congress for the assistance.
   ``After 10 years of trying to destroy Nicaragua, we do have a
responsibility to help democracy,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that doles out
foreign aid. critical agriculture, petroleum and medical supplies;
$10 million for emergency employment programs; $50 million to help
Nicaragua pay off debts to the International Monetary Fund and
other financial institutions; $75 million to help support
Nicaragua's currency as part of economic restructuring; $60 million
for infrastructure projects including major bridgem highway, school
and hospital repairs, as well as the $45 million for the
repatriation and resettlement of the Contras.
   The White House said $21 million left over from programs to
assist the Contras and monitor the Nicaraguan elections would be
used for emergency aid to Nicaragua while the larger package goes
through Congress.

<TEXT>
   The space shuttle Atlantis' journey
back to Kennedy Space Center in Florida resumed today despite poor
weather along the flight route, NASA officials said.
   A modified Boeing 747 with Atlantis bolted atop took off from
Biggs Army Airfield in far western Texas en route to a refueling
stop at Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi, said NASA spokesman
Bruce Buckingham.
   A military transport plane took off 45 minutes ahead of the
shuttle transport to check on the weather, Buckingham said.
   Forecasters reported rain, poor visibility and low clouds along
much of the route, Buckingham said.
   Rain is a threat to the shuttle's exterior heat-insulating tiles.
   Based on weather observations during the three-hour refueling
stop at Columbus, a decision was to be made whether to continue on
to Cape Canaveral, Fla., a two-hour flight, Buckingham said.
   The shuttle and its transport landed at Biggs on Sunday for
refueling after leaving Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., where
Atlantis landed March 4 following a 4{-day military mission.
   Buckingham said the delays would not affect Atlantis' next
flight scheduled in July, another secret Pentagon mission.

   Three-time winner Susan Butcher pushed into
the lead of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race again today during the
treacherous crossing of ice-covered Norton Sound on the Bering Sea.
   And after a short rest she and her team took off on the final
171 miles of the 11,058-mile race from Anchorage to Nome.
   Race observers expect the winner to reach Nome on Wednesday
evening. Of the 70 teams that began the race in Anchorage on March
3, seven have scratched and another was disqualified because of
sick dogs.
   Butcher left the Shaktoolik checkpoint late Monday eight minutes
behind defending champion Joe Runyan, but had passed him by the end
of the nighttime 30-mile ice crossing today and had built a
55-minute lead.
   The mushers head out onto the ice of Norton Sound trying to save
time and miles, but it is one of the most dangerous segments of the
race. Open water leads in the ice can force time-consuming detours,
or swallow an unwary team.
   ``Once they get onto the (Bering Sea) ice, they can expect
sudden storms and an ample supply of wind,'' Gail Somerville, an
Iditarod spokeswoman in Anchorage, said Monday night.
   Named for an abandoned gold-mining town along the trail, the
Iditarod was started in 1973 to commemorate the 1925 emergency
delivery of life-saving diphtheria serum from Anchorage to Nome by
sled dog teams.
   The winner will get $50,000 and the rest of a $200,000 purse
will be split among the next 19 finishers.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, there was a report last week that you are so
angry and upset at the Fed's failure to lower interest rates that
you wouldn't reappoint Chairman Greenspan next year when his term
ends. Can you comment on whether there is any thought you've given
yet to the question of reappointing Mr. Greenspan, and the level of
frustration you do feel about interest rates?
   A: No, there is no discussion of that nature at all. I didn't _
I _ sure, I saw the report. I saw some speculation someplace. Maybe
it was on a _ on the TV. But I have no _ that's never been
discussed with me. Now, if the question is am I happy with interest
rates? Look, every president would like to see interest rates
lower. There's no question. I don't _ I don't knock the concern
that some have on inflation.
   A president has to be concerned about inflation, too. But there
is no bubbling war with Alan Greenspan, and that's what I got from
what commentary I heard that there was _ but, you know, going back
a few years here, it's ever been thus, hasn't it? When there's a _
when there are some differences it's always built into a conflict
between the president and the chairman of the Fed, and I don't want
to get into that game because I don't _ I don't feel that way.
   Q: But is there a particular feeling at this point that the Fed
is dragging its feet somewhat in getting interest rates down?
   A: I think some feel that way, and I think some probably agree
with the concerns of the inflationary concerns that have been
expressed. So _ but I'm not in a mode _ a Fed-bashing mode. I also
think it's very sensitive in terms of markets and everything else
for _ to even go as far as I have done trying to say very little _
(scattered laughter) _ and succeeding only moderately. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, you've been at near historical public approval
ratings now for well into your first term, 80 percent or more. And
my question is whether you believe in spending some of this
popularity on something controversial like, say, what specifically
do you like about Rostenkowski's proposal, or just hoarding it? You
know, what's the goal?
   A: I don't believe it, is one thing. I don't believe in polls
that much.
   Q: Well, I guess the question is, you know, are you saying _
   A: Talk to Nicaragua's man _ talk to Ortega's man. Probably
gainfully unemployed right now for missing it by a jillion points.
But, these things come and go, seriously. And I learned this _ do
you know where I learned it? Back in _ back in Illinois in 1980. I
don't remember why, but I remember Vic Gold lecturing me on hanging
your hat on polls. That's not what _ what I _ that's not the way I
try to call the shots on the policy.
   You just raised the questions about China. If I had my finger in
the wind, I might have done that one differently. I might have done
differently about going to Cartagena if I had put my finger in the
wind in terms of polls. But, that's not the way I run this
administration. And so, I _ I know some think so, but that's not _
that's not the point. And so, I am not going to dwell on them
because tomorrow it may be very different, and then I'll have to
constantly say, ``Hey, wait a minute.''
   Q: (Inaudible) _ along for one more question? Does it become a
possibility though that when you're at like 80 percent, that that
almost becomes an end in itself at some point, I mean, at such an
extraordinary level?
   A: You mean, pull the rip cord and get out?
   Q: Well, I mean _ (Laughter.)
   A: What do you mean? (Laughter.)
   Q: Well, when you're 80 percent it would be tempting, I would
think, just to simply protect that lead, sort of fall on the ball.
   A: No. I don't _ that _ please believe me, that doesn't _
doesn't guide the decisions we take, and I have given you a couple
of examples, and I'm trying to do the best I can for the country
and to work with the Congress. And I _ there's a lot of areas where
I have not succeeded near as well as I would like to. But, I don't
live by the polls. Yeah _ Maureen?

<HEAD>Afghanistan Says Rebels Attack Strategic City of Khost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S.-backed rebels attacked the
strategic southern city of Khost, killing at least two soldiers,
and government troops responded with Soviet-made Scud rockets, a
government spokesman said Tuesday.
   It was not clear whether the attack was related to last week's
failed coup attempt by former Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai,
who is from Khost, located near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan.
He is popular in the region.
   East European diplomats said they were concerned Tanai, who fled
to Pakistan after his coup failed, would unite with the U.S.-backed
guerrillas to take the city, giving the rebels a foothold in
Afghanistan. Unconfirmed reports from Pakistan said Tanai began
negotiations with the government commander for the Khost region.
   Government spokesman Naqib Sameer said soldiers had been
``courageously defending'' three positions around Khost for three
days. He also acknowledged the government suffered at least two
casualties. There was no word on guerrilla casualties.
   Sameer said rebel forces were attacking security posts from all
directions and were shelling the city, an indication the guerrillas
might be closing in on Khost.
   Witnesses said about six Soviet-made surface-to-surface missiles
were fired south from Kabul over the last day. Sameer said some of
the 45-foot-long missiles were aimed at Khost.
   The government also reported increased fighting near Jalalabad,
the scene of an unsuccessful guerrilla assault last spring after
the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
   Again it was unclear whether the fighting near Jalalabad was
related to Tanai's coup attempt. In a statement apparently released
by Tanai in Pakistan, the former defense minister said he was
planning to unite with the guerrillas to topple President Najib,
who was installed in 1986.
   Tanai is known as a shrewd commander and generally is considered
responsible for Afghanistan's successful defense of Jalalabad
against guerrilla attacks.
   Soviet troops were stationed in Afghanistan for about a decade
and installed the current Communist-led government. The last Red
Army troops were withdrawn in February 1989.
   Soviet aid has increased following the coup attempt. More than
30 transport planes, each loaded with 25 tons of weapons and
medicine, land daily at Kabul's airport, Eastern European diplomats
said.
   The government also said 4,200 tons of goods from the Soviet
Union have reached Kabul by land in the last three days.

<HEAD>Lithuania's U.N. Membership Not Likely Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania, which has declared its
independence from the Soviet Union, won't be eligible to join the
United Nations for a long time, U.N. officials and diplomats said.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Monday that he
was ``monitoring the situation'' in the Baltic republic and had no
comment on the possibility of U.N. membership.
   The new Lithuanian government has not made any moves to join the
United Nations and faces lengthy negotiations with the Soviet Union
on secession. Lithuania still does not control its territory, nor
can it enter into international obligations until it is free from
Moscow.
   Both territorial control and the ability to carry out
international treaties are considered by many observers to be
qualifications for genuine statehood and U.N. membership.
   The Soviet Union does not recognize Lithuania's declaration of
independence and seeks more than $32 billion in compensation from
it.
   The world body has 159 members. Namibia, which becomes
independent on March 21, is expected to become the 160th state.
   U.N. membership is open to all peace-loving states which accept
the U.N. Charter and are considered by the general membership to be
willing and able to carry out its obligations.
   A state shall be admitted to the United Nations with a
two-thirds vote of the General Assembly and the recommendation of
the 15-member Security Council. The Soviet Union is one of five
permanent members of the council with veto power and could block
membership. The other four are the United States, Britain, China
and France.
   Margers Pinnis, spokesman for the Baltic Appeal to the United
Nations, said Tuesday that U.N. membership was unlikely until
Lithuania settled more pressing security and economic issues. But
he said his organization would help convey information between
Lithuania and the world body.
   ``I remind members of the United Nations,'' he said, ``that the
nations of Africa and the world in general were and are
instrumental in establishing Namibia as an independent state and in
making many U.N. members viable and independent.''
   ``I see no reason why the Baltic states should not be recipients
of similar political and moral support, since there are many
precedents in previous U.N. actions,'' he said in an interview.

   Thieves using explosives and an assault
rifle robbed a security company's armored car Tuesday, killing two
guards and wounding a third, police said.
   The armored vehicle had just left a depot of the company,
Securiposte, carrying an undisclosed amount of money, when a car
drove across its path and forced it to halt, according to police in
the Mediterranean port city.
   One of the thieves placed an explosive device at the rear of the
armored vehicle. The blast killed one of the guards, and a second
was killed and a third seriously injured in an exchange of gunfire
with the hooded attackers, police said.
   The thieves fled in two cars with several sacks of money, at one
point firing at the driver of a car pursuing them, police said.
   A police official, Marcel Morin, described the holdup as ``an
act of terrorism.''
   A similar attack took place in Marseille in 1984, with robbers
using explosives so powerful that the armored car's cargo was
destroyed and three people were killed.
   There have been 10 successful holdups of armored cars in France
since 1985, including one on March 1 near the eastern city of
Mulhouse in which $6.9 million was stolen.

<TEXT>
   A leader of the Romanian revolution predicts
that for the next decade Eastern Europe will be a ``semi-colony''
of Western Europe.
   Silviu Brucan, a leading member of the Romanian National
Salvation Front, also says the U.S. government is ``impotent'' to
influence developments in the region.
   In a speech Monday night, Brucan described as ``peanuts'' the
economic assistance the United States has given to Poland, and said
Western European nations were becoming much more involved in the
region. He drew a sharp distinction between the role being played
by the U.S. government and American corporations. Some American
enterprises have announced major investments in the area.
   Brucan also said ``Japan is the natural partner of the Soviet
Union'' and could greatly contribute to its development if those
countries normalize relations.
   He said the Soviet Union should return the northern Kurile
Islands to Japan to pave the way for a peace treaty formally ending
World War II between the two countries. The Soviets occupied the
Kuriles in the last days of the war, and this has strained
relations between the two countries.
   Brucan said improved relations with Japan would alter Moscow's
balance of power with Washington and enable the Soviet Union to
strengthen its bargaining position with the United States by
``playing the Japanese card.''
   He stressed the potential of Japanese technical and economic
assistance. ``What Japan could do in Siberia nobody else could
do,'' he said.
   Speaking at a small private dinner with American businessmen and
journalists, Brucan said the former one-party Communist countries
of Eastern Europe had fallen behind technologically and ``for the
next 10 years are doomed to be a semi-colony of Western Europe.''
   He said this semi-colonial status could be reduced or eliminated
if the Social Democratic Party wins the next election in West
Germany and the Labor Party wins the next elections in Britain. He
said both would be more sympathetic to Eastern European economic
development than their conservative opponents.
   Brucan, a former Romanian ambassador to the United States and
the United Nations, became one of the leaders of the provisional
government that took over after the fall of dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu last December. He resigned from the Front's formal
leadership in January but remains one of its leading figures.
   Brucan said Romania and other Eastern European countries should
look at Sweden and Austria for economic models. He said they should
adopt a system in which ``the market sets productions, but the
state watches over the distribution of income to prevent vast
disparities between the rich and the poor.''
   Brucan, a founding member of the Romanian Communist Party, said
the dissolution of Communist parties in Eastern Euriope and
elsewhere is inevitable. He attributed this to the
``scientific-technical revolution'' that changed the class
structures on which communism is based and reduced the role of
manual workers in industry and society.

   Mayor Marion Barry today publicly acknowledged
a ``chemical dependency'' to alcohol and two prescription drugs,
but said he won't resign while fighting federal cocaine and perjury
charges.
   ``I'm back. I feel good about myself,'' the mayor said in his
first extended public appearance since he was arrested and left the
city for substance abuse treatment in Florida and South Carolina.
   Barry read a lengthy statement that made no mention of cocaine.
Nor did he say directly whether he intends to seek a fourth term as
mayor. He said his campaign manager would make an announcement soon
about this fall's campaign.
   ``My political organization is still intact, notwithstanding
some defections,'' Barry said. Several top Barry campaign officials
have switched their support in the mayoral race to Walter Fauntroy,
the city's non-voting delegate on Capitol Hill.
   Barry did not answer reporters' questions.
   The mayor said he was diagnosed at a Florida treatment center as
being dependent on alcohol, Valium and Xanax. Valium and Xanax are
both commonly prescribed to treat anxiety.
   He said he would attend treatment sessions once or twice a day,
as well as therapy sessions with others who are addicted. He
implored the news media to ``respect my privacy and the privacy of
other recovering people.''
   As for his trial, Barry said, ``I'm going to turn the outcome of
this over to God, my attorney'' and the judge and jurors in the
case. ``The truth will come out in the trial,'' he said.
   He said, ``I want to continue to serve this community.''
   Barry was flanked by top city officials and attorney R. Kenneth
Mundy. His wife, Effi, whom he thanked for her support, was not on
stage as Barry spoke.
   The mayor was charged in January with one misdemeanor count of
cocaine possession after a widely publicized arrest in an FBI
``sting'' operation at a downtown Washington hotel.
   He was indicted last month on three felony counts of perjury for
allegedly lying to a grand jury about cocaine use and five
misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession. He is scheduled to stand
trial on June 4.
   Barry's news conference was his first public appearance since
his somewhat mysterious return to the capital city after seven
weeks of treatment at rehabilitation facilities in Florida and
South Carolina.
   Before Barry began speaking, supporters passed out buttons
saying ``I'm with Barry in the 90s.'' As he began to speak, some in
the audience, which included a large number of city workers,
chanted ``Barry, Barry,'' and ``Four More Years.''
   Barry's political situation has deteriorated since his arrest.
The most visible evidence came when Fauntroy announced March 3 that
he would run for mayor in the Democratic primary.
   There are four other Democrats in the race, as well as former
police chief Maurice Turner, running as a Republican.
   Barry spoke directly several times to the city's news media,
urging them to avoid the temptation of covering his every public
move.
   ``Let me urge you not to treat this lightly. You wouldn't treat
cancer, heart disease or diabetes lightly, would you?''

<HEAD>Editorial Says Party Needs to Regain Faith of the Masses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's leading newspaper on Tuesday called on
Communist Party members to regain the faith of the masses,
indicating the party fears it has lost touch with a populace
unhappy with the political and economic climate.
   The People's Daily editorial followed Monday's announcement of a
party Central Committee communique that indicated the same fear
with its call for the party to strengthen ties with the masses.
   The first point in the lengthy document was a call for ``party
organizations at all levels to pay special attention to the
solution of those problems which the masses are most concerned
with.''
   ``This has to be done as a practical move to (bring) close the
ties between the party and the masses,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency quoted the communique as saying.
   The communique was the only document released by the Central
Committee at the end of its semi-annual four-day meeting Monday.
   The unsigned editorial in the party newspaper said, ``Every
communist, especially leading cadres, must read this document (the
communique) and carry out a Marxist mass outlook.''
   ``The party mass line is the party's lifeline,'' the paper said.
   The mass line was first outlined by revolutionary leader Mao
Tse-tung in 1943 in the principle of ``from the masses, to the
masses.''
   Party leaders are supposed to mingle with the masses and gain an
understanding of their thoughts and concerns, to use that
understanding in establishing policy, and to take those policies
back to the masses, explaining and popularizing the ideas until the
masses embrace them as their own.
   In the past decade, the importance of the mass line gave way to
senior leader Deng Xiaoping's economic reform policies, but it has
been resurrected since last spring's massive movement for democracy
and other political changes.
   ``Anytime the party mass line is carried out well, the relation
between the party and the masses will become more intimate and our
undertakings will develop smoothly,'' the editorial said, implying
that failure to follow the mass line was the cause of the
pro-democracy demonstrations that occurred in more than 80 cities
across China.
   In addition to calls for democracy and freedom, demonstrators
criticized Chinese leaders and officials who enjoy lives of special
privileges and use their positions for personal financial gains.
   The party lost even more respect among the masses after the
bloody military attack on June 3-4 that left hundreds and perhaps
thousands dead in Beijing and marked the beginning of a nationwide
crackdown on dissent.
   The party is trying polish its tarnished image. During the
Chinese New Year holiday, China's top leaders traveled the country,
rubbing shoulders with coal miners and factory workers, trading
jokes and kissing babies.
   Party officials at all levels have been bombarded with calls
``to go down to the grassroots level'' to implement the mass line.
   Cases of corruption among officials have been uncovered with
renewed fervor, and in recent days, the official media have
reported the arrests of several officials, including a vice
minister, for various economic crimes.
   ``History has proven that as long as the party and the people
stick together, all obstacles will be surmounted,'' Monday's
editorial said.
   China's economy, which less than two years ago was afflicted
with runaway inflation, has added to the dissatisfaction with the
party.
   After battling skyrocketing prices, Chinese now are told to
tighten their belts as the nation begins a three-year austerity
program that has resulted in the closures of thousands of
enterprises and the layoff of millions of workers.
   ``Socialist economic construction cannot be carried out without
the masses,'' the editorial said.

<HEAD>Retail Sales Take Steep Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retail sales in February took their steepest
fall in four months, the government reported Tuesday, but analysts
said the decline was due almost entirely to sagging automobiles
sales.
   ``The 0.9 percent decline is very deceptive,'' said Sandra
Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group here. ``It's all cars,
virtually. Consumer spending (elsewhere) is holding up pretty
well.''
   ``True, automobiles sales fell, but almost all other sectors
experienced nice increases,'' agreed William K. MacReynolds,
forecasting director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The Commerce Department said retail sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted $146.5 billion. The decline was the biggest since a 1.3
percent drop in October and followed a strong 2.8 percent gain in
January. The January number originally had been reported at 1.6
percent.
   Automobile sales plummeted 6 percent in February after jumping
9.9 percent in January, when sales incentives were restored. It was
the biggest drop since auto sales fell 26.5 percent in January 1987.
   But excluding automobiles, retail sales actually rose 0.5
percent.
   John Silvia, an economist with Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago, said the non-auto spending combined with the substantial
upward January revision suggests that consumer spending is going to
be fairly strong in the first quarter.
   Silvia said the level of spending is consistent with other
recent consumer economic reports, including employment growth and
personal income.
   ``When you put it all together, you have a package that says
that there's no economic recession,'' he said.
   Retail sales represent about one-third of the nation's economic
activity.
   It also suggests, Silvia added, that the Federal Reserve will
not act soon to lower interest rates further to stimulate the
economy.
   The construction and much of the manufacturing sector of the
economy have been battered by high rates as the central bank sought
to slow inflation, prompting some economists and government
officials to urge the Fed to ease its grip on credit.
   Sales of durable goods _ big-ticket, interest-sensitive items
expected to last more than three years _ fell 3 percent in February
after gaining 6.7 percent a month earlier.
   Except for autos, however, the durable categories rose _
building materials, up 3 percent, and furniture and other home
furnishings, up 0.5 percent.
   Silvia contended the volatility in auto sales is a ``pricing
problem.''
   ``What seems to be happening is that in those months when we
don't have incentives, we seem to have stronger than normal
non-auto sales,'' he said. ``And when we have the incentives put
on, then auto retail sales come up and non-auto retail sales come
down.''
   Most non-durable goods categories also posted gains. Department
store sales were up 2 percent; apparel, 1.6 percent; restaurants
and bars, 1.4 percent; and grocery stores, 0.5 percent.
   Declines were registered in drug store and gasoline station
sales, but the latter reflected price declines, not volume,
analysts said. Both were down 0.8 percent.
   For the three months from December through February, overall
retail sales were up 1.2 percent.

<HEAD>Paris Opera Architect Garnier Honored at Musee d'Orsay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The splendor of the Paris Opera house and the story
of its troubled construction spanning half a century are the focus
of an exhibition at the Musee d'Orsay saluting the architectural
genius of Charles Garnier.
   With dozens of paintings, architectural drawings, blueprints,
photographs, the show is likely to delight both opera lovers and
history buffs.
   With its ornate facade, sumptuous marble staircase, intricate
and gilded mouldings and painted ceilings, the Paris Opera is
considered the most successful monument of the Second Empire.
   The exhibition, which runs through June 10, spotlights another
Garnier design: the Opera de Monte-Carlo in the Casino overlooking
the Mediterranean.
   On display are opera memorabilia including costumes, posters and
miniature sets of the house's most remarkable productions.
   Garnier, basking in the glory of the popular Paris Opera, took
on the Monte-Carlo project in 1878, completing it nine months later.
   Opera is no longer performed at Garnier's theater in Paris, as
the new, high-tech Opera-Bastille opened in July. Nonetheless, it
remains the home of the Paris Opera Ballet Company _ as well as a
popular tourist attraction.
   The idea for a Paris opera house was conceived in 1820, but it
took 40 years to organize an architectural competition. There were
171 contestants, including the heavily favored Eugene
Viollet-le-Duc.
   The French music world went into shock when the winner was
announced _ a 35-year-old virtual unknown named Charles Garnier.
   Garnier was born in 1825, the son of a craftsman. A frail,
nervous youngster, he excelled in drawing and mathematics and
entered the Ecole des Beaux Arts.
   ``There is no choice among the arts,'' he once said. ``You have
to be either the good Lord or an architect.''
   His project ran into trouble from the start. Baron Georges
Eugene Haussmann, Napoleon III's urban planner who gave Paris its
broad, sweeping boulevards, chose the site for the new building _
over a network of underground springs.
   Construction was halted several times, the project nearly
canceled by changing regimes and political intrigue. The Opera
finally opened on Jan. 5, 1875.
   Garnier dreamed of creating a Napoleon III style, much as Kings
Louis XIII, XIV, XV and XVI had elaborate designs named for them.
   But the style was too grandiose _ the emperor had his own
entrance ramp wide enough for him to ride straight to the royal box
in his horse-drawn carriage _ and never caught on as a school of
its own.

   The efforts of Lithuania and its Baltic
neighbors to regain their freedom are ``fully and uniquely
justified,'' the State Department said Tuesday.
   The statement by Margaret Tutwiler, the department's
spokeswoman, was the strongest U.S. endorsement to date of the
declaration of independence voted unanimously on Sunday by
Nicaragua's new parliament.
   President Bush said ``we rejoice as people are permitted the
free expression that we take for granted in this country.'' But he
said the United States was not immediately offering full diplomatic
recognition to Lithuania ``because we want to see the evolution of
the control of the territory there and ... a peaceful resolution to
this question.''
   If the Lithuanian situation causes the Soviet Union concern, Ms.
Tutwiler said, those worries should be dealt with through
``constructive negotiations with the Lithuanian people.''
   The U.S. remarks followed strong criticism of the Lithuanian
move toward independence by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
as he addressed the Congress of Peoples Deputies in Moscow.
   Gorbachev, who on Monday called the prospect of Lithuanian
independence ``alarming,'' told the Congress that the declaration
of Lithuanian independence was ``illegal and invalid.''
   But Gorbachev also urged patience, saying Moscow's relations
with the Baltic republic would continue unchanged for now and that
a Soviet commission was studying how to respond to Lithuania's
action.
   Gorbachev made clear that Lithuania's independence drive is
likely to encounter strong resistance.
   ``We cannot talk about negotiations,'' he said. ``You carry out
negotiations with a foreign country.''
   Although several Soviet lawmakers said it was likely Gorbachev
would soften his position, he won applause when he said the Kremlin
would not give in to demands to negotiate independence with
republics seeking independence, including the other two Baltic
states _ Latvia and Estonia.
   Ms. Tutwiler noted that the United States has never recognized
the forcible incorporation of Lithuania and the other two Baltic
states into the Soviet Union in 1940 following a secret deal
between Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler.
   ``That incorporation in our view was taken in violation of
international law,'' she said and added:
   ``We believe that the efforts of these three states _ Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia _ to regain their freedom are fully and uniquely
justified by any standard and the wishes of their peoples should be
respected.''
   ``We urge the Soviet Union to address its concerns through
constructive negotiations with the Lithuanian people,'' she said.
   Earlier, President Bush told a news conference at the White
House that ``clearly, I think there's a great deal of interest in
this concept of ... Lithuanians working it out with the Soviets to
achieve what they want.''
   But as for final diplomatic recognition of Lithuania as a
sovereign state, Bush said that must follow negotiations to give
Lithuania full control of its territory and full authority over all
functions of government.

   Disabled demonstrators in wheelchairs were
arrested in the U.S. Capitol today after confronting House leaders
with demands for quick passage of legislation guaranteeing them
civil rights protections.
   A crowd of more than 100 demonstrators threatened civil
disobedience and interrupted House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and
House Republican Leader Bob Michel as the congressional leaders
tried to speak over the din in the cavernous Capitol Rotunda.
   After the congressmen left, about 70 of the people with
disabilities assembled in the center of the Rotunda and began
chanting in a planned attempt to provoke arrest. Capitol police,
standing nearby, encircled the protesters and began taking them
into custody.
   Outside the Capitol, a line of government-owned vans were lined
up, and police began placing the protesters _ most in wheelchairs _
into the vehicles.
   Some of the protesters chained their wheelchairs together.
Police used large snipping tools to break the chains.
   The demonstrators were being charged with unlawful entry and
demonstrating within the Capitol, said a spokesman for the Capitol
Police, Officer G.T. Nevitt. The first charge carries a maximum
sentence of six months in jail and $100 fine, and the second, six
months in jail and a $500 fine.
   ``It is a priority for passage in this session of the
Congress,'' Foley shouted over catcalls from some of the estimated
150 people arrayed before him in their wheelchairs. ``I am
absolutely satisfied it will reach the floor, we will have a
conference with the Senate and it will become law.''
   ``Will it be on the floor in 24 hours? No,'' Foley added, in a
statement greeted with a chorus of boos.
   The speaker said, ``I am not going to set an artificial deadline
that prevents the committees from sending a bill to the floor that
they can defend.''
   It was the second day of lobbying by the disabled. On Monday,
dozens of people crawled out of their wheelchairs and up the steps
of the Capitol to dramatize their demands.
   ``I'll take all night if I have to,'' said the youngest,
8-year-old Jennifer Keelan of Denver, as she pulled her small body
up the steps.
   ``Come on, Jenny, you're almost there,'' said Michael Winter of
Berkeley, Calif., who was making his own difficult journey up the
83 stone steps of the Capitol's West Front.
   They were among 60 or so people who put on the demonstration
Monday following a rally at the base of the Capitol steps by about
1,000 people supporting legislation to ensure rights to people with
disabilities.
   The focus of the protest was the Americans with Disabilities
Act, which passed the Senate last year but has bogged down in the
House, despite widespread predictions of its ultimate passage.
   The measure would outlaw discrimination based on physical or
mental disability in employment, access to buildings, use of the
telephone system, use of public and private transportation and in
other uses. The Capitol building has ramps for wheelchair access to
two of its entrances and ramps and elevators inside to enable
people confined to wheelchairs to get around.
   ``We're not asking for any favors,'' said I. King Jordan,
president of Gallaudet University and the first deaf person to hold
that position at the school for people with impaired hearing.
``We're simply asking the same rights and equality any other
American has.''
   ``What we did for civil rights in the '60s, we forgot to do for
people with disabilities,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   During the midday faceoff in the Rotunda, Foley sought to assure
the disabled that House leaders ``want to see that this bill has
the greatest possible support and will reach the president's desk
in a way that he can sign it.''
   Michel told the crowd he had broached the issue earlier today in
a meeting with President Bush at the White House. Of the 24-hour
deadline presented House members by the disabled, he said, ``That's
unreasonable.''
   He acknowledged that ``the (disabled) community is getting a
little bit impatient because the wheels of Congress are not moving
fast enough.''
   Although the bill is supported by the Bush administration and
congressional leaders, some have begun questioning the
administration's commitment in recent weeks. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater denied its support was slipping and said the
administration was negotiating with key members of Congress.
   ``We do support the legislation,'' Fitzwater said. ``We're very
supportive of their rights and their cause. President Bush has
spoken out on that in the past.''

   A helicopter carrying 13 people
crashed in the harbor while on a flight from the international
airport, and a navy spokesman said Tuesday that only two people
survived.
   The helicopter went down 2{ miles from Lungi International
Airport on Monday night. Rescuers had pulled five bodies from the
water before the search was halted for the day Tuesday.
   The survivors were the co-pilot, a Spanish national whose name
was not immediately available, and a passenger of Lebanese
nationality.
   Others on the Spanish-manufactured helicopter included the
pilot, a Spaniard, four Sierra Leoneans and six Lebanese.
   The helicopter was carrying people who had gone to the airport,
seven miles across the harbor from a tourist hotel on Lumley Beach,
to say goodbye to departing relatives, the navy spokesman said.

   James A. Michener, whose panoramic
novels reflect a lifetime of globetrotting, is thinking of settling
down each winter in Florida, his editor says.
   The 83-year-old author has no plans for another epic that would
require years of geographical reasearch, so he's hunting for a
winter retirement home, coordinating editor James Kings said
Monday. Michener will spend his summers at a condominium he bought
in Brunswick, Maine, Kings said.
   For years, Michener has set up quarters in whatever part of the
world he happens to be writing about. He spent three years in Miami
while writing ``Caribbean,'' his latest best-seller.
   Last month, Michener visited a group of retired professionals at
Eckerd College in St. Petersburg.
   ``He said they were very interesting people down there, and he
was more interested in that than he was in the sun,'' Kings said.
   ``Eckerd College is the most recent place he's visited and may
well be the most promising,'' Kings said. ``Michener wants an
academic setting and a living arrangement that includes medical
facilities for when you really get sick.''
   The college's Academy of Senior Professionals has more than 200
retired professionals and their spouses who attend classes and
study groups and counsel students.
   Michener is a professor emeritus at the University of Texas at
Austin, where he lives with his 69-year-old wife, Mari.

   Paul McCartney, who is touring Japan for the first
time since the Beatles performed there in 1966, has donated
$250,000 to fight cancer and help clean up the Earth.
   Half of the funds will go to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York and the rest to the Japanese chapter of the
environmental group Friends of the Earth, tour publicist Fiona
Hurry said Tuesday.
   ``As we all know, cancer causes great suffering, and I have
great respect for all those who try to lessen the pain as best they
can,'' McCartney said. ``I also have hope that one day science and
medicine will find a way to beat cancer forever.''
   The 47-year-old rock 'n' roller has been using his world tour,
which began in Oslo in September, to promote Friends of the Earth.
   ``All I am trying to do on this world tour is to hopefully make
people think about how we're wrecking this world and ask them to
challenge their politicians to act,'' he said.
   A planned Japan tour in 1980 was derailed when the singer was
arrested at Tokyo's airport for possession of marijuana and later
deported.
   His current band, which includes wife Linda on keyboards and
percussion, played the last of six concerts Tuesday at the Tokyo
Dome, an indoor baseball stadium.
   His show features elaborate light and laser effects, more than a
dozen Beatle hits including ``Hey Jude,'' ``Let it Be'' and ``Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' and several cuts from
McCartney's latest album, ``Flowers in the Dirt.''
   The tour will travel to the United States, Brazil, and back to
Europe, where it is to end in April.

   Actress Valerie Bertinelli says she is
struggling to save her nine-year marriage to rock star Eddie Van
Halen while he works to overcome alcoholism.
   ``He doesn't abuse me; he hurts himself,'' Bertinelli, 30, is
quoted as saying in April's Redbook magazine. ``He's got a problem
I'm not happy with, but I bring stability to his life.
   ``And besides, I love him. It's my weakness. Some people are
addicted to food. I'm addicted to my husband,'' she said.
   ``I can't say that we're really great friends _ we don't have a
helluva lot in common _ but we'll always be connected like brother
and sister. That helps when the romance comes and goes.''
   Van Halen, 33, checked into a drug and alcohol treatment program
in Burbank, Calif., on Jan. 1. Bertinelli says she gets support
from the families of other substance abusers at Al-Anon meetings.
   ``I'm proud of him. I'll support him in every way I can,'' she
said. ``I feel more sorry for Ed than I do for myself. If worse
comes to worst, I can always pick up and leave, but he's still
stuck with his problem.''

   Hotel queen Leona Helmsley says her 81-year-old
husband is ``all right'' after tumbling down a flight of stairs and
hitting his head, a published report says.
   Real estate magnate Harry Helmsley fell after exercising with a
physical therapist Monday in his Park Lane Hotel apartment.
   Columnist Cindy Adams wrote in Tuesday's New York Post that Mrs.
Helmsley had issued standing orders that someone always precede her
husband down the stairs. But no one was in front of Helmsley when
he lost his footing, Adams wrote.
   ``I was waiting for Harry to join me for lunch,'' Mrs. Helmsley
was quoted as saying. ``Instead, an ambulance became my lunch.''
   She said her husband suffered bruises on his head and face.
   ``His faculties are fine. He knows everything that's
happening,'' Mrs. Helmsley said. ``I'm so scared, but they tell me
he's going to be all right. Maybe God is really on my side after
all.''
   Mrs. Helmsley was convicted on charges of conspiracy, tax
evasion and fraud, ordered to pay $7.5 million in fines and to
serve four years in prison. She is free pending an appeal.
   Helmsley was deemed incompetent to stand trial in federal court
on charges of income tax evasion.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev rejected
Lithuania's declaration of independence and ruled out talks with
the rebellious republic Tuesday, but lawmakers from the region said
they were sure he'd soften his stance.
   Gorbachev told the Congress of People's Deputies he considers
the Lithuanian move ``illegal and invalid'' and said the Kremlin
would not begin wholesale negotiations with republics seeking
independence.
   ``We cannot talk about negotiations,'' he said. ``You carry out
negotiations with a foreign country.''
   Gorbachev, however, also urged patience and said Moscow's
relations with the Baltic republic would continue unchanged for now
in the wake of Sunday's vote by Lithuanian lawmakers to break away
from the Soviet Union.
   Despite the Soviet leader's tough line, several deputies from
the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said they had
strong reason to believe Moscow would nonetheless enter
negotiations on independence for the three states, which were
annexed to the Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``Gorbachev is a realist,'' said Lithuanian deputy Algimantas
Chekuolis. ``He'll change his stand.''
   Estonian lawmaker Endel Lippmaa said Estonia had already formed
its delegation for independence negotiations, and Lithuanian deputy
Nikolai Medvedev said he had been told talks might begin as early
as Saturday.
   In its attempt to turn Sunday's declaration into reality,
Lithuania must work out with Moscow a daunting array of questions,
including matters of territory, compensation, the status of
thousands of Soviet soldiers, ownership of factories and land, and
control of the police and KGB.
   The Tass news agency said Lithuanian legislators declared Monday
that their sons no longer need serve in the Soviet army. They
appealed to Gorbachev to ensure the welfare of Lithuanian soldiers
until negotiations start on mustering them out.
   Lithuanian activist Arunya Contautaite said Tuesday that 5,000
young Lithuanian men out of about 15,000 conscripts had refused to
enter the army during this spring's draft.
   With so many issues to decide, Sajudis, the Lithuanian
pro-independence movement that now dominates the republic's
government, wants to start talks right away, but Lithuanian
Communist Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas, who sounded out
Gorbachev last week, said he did not believe Moscow would agree.
   ``I don't think Moscow will go for that,'' he said in an
interview Monday on the plane from the Lithuanian capital of
Vilnius to Moscow.
   Gorbachev opened the second-day session of the Congress of
People's Deputies on Tuesday by giving the 2,000 lawmakers an
update on the government's reaction to the Lithuanian vote.
   ``I think it is illegal and invalid,'' he said. He won applause
from the Congress when he said the Kremlin would not negotiate with
republics seeking independence.
   But he also added that a ``political and judicial evaluation''
was needed, and said Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and a commission had
begun studying the matter. He also proposed charging the Supreme
Soviet, the Congress' working legislature, with beginning
discussion of the push for independence in Estonia and Lithuania
within the next two days.
   Gorbachev did not appear overly angry at the Lithuanians, and
even addressed a light joke in their direction. At one point, he
referred to Lithuanians as ``comrades,'' then paused and said: ``I
think they are comrades.''
   Lithuanian delegates who said they came as mere observers to the
Congress asked Tuesday for recognition of their declaration of
statehood and for the start of talks on their secession. On Tuesday
night, Lithuanian president Vytautas Landsbergis appealed on
national TV for understanding of the republic's aims and assured
viewers it would use only peacefl means and respect all minority
groups within its borders.
   Among backlash Lithuanians say they expect from Moscow is a
partial economic blockade, including of crucial fuel supplies for
which Lithuania is dependent on the Soviet Union.
   Brazauskas said Monday night Moscow officials had told him they
would undoubtedly start charging Lithuania normal world prices for
fuel, instead of the subsidized price.
   Brazauskas said he also expected many Soviet factories to use
Lithuania's self-proclaimed independence as an excuse to stop
supplying it with goods, or to provide them only for hard currency.
   Gorbachev demanded in talks with Brazauskas a week ago that the
republic pay 21 billion rubles _ about $34 billion _ in hard
currency for Soviet investment in factories and infrastructure in
the past half-century.
   He also suggested Lithuania might have to hand over the Baltic
port of Klaipeda, a key city the independent republic would need to
carry out foreign trade.
   But Chekuolis, a Sajudis leader, said the Kremlin should pay 300
billion rubles _ about $500 billion _ to compensate for 300,000
people killed, imprisoned or exiled by Stalin and his successors,
and for economic havoc caused by a half-century of Soviet
mismanagement.
   Lithuania would not insist on convertible currency because the
money spent on them was the Soviet Union's non-convertible
currency, he said.
   Chekuolis said the figure takes into account a calculation of
what the republic's GNP would now be if it had continued to grow at
the pace it had prior its absorption into the Soviet Union. The
republic had a 10 percent annual growth rate during independence,
and if independent would have an economy as strong as Finland, he
said.
   In Paris, the Bank of France said Tuesday it will return the
prewar gold in its vaults to Lithuania if the French government
recognizes the new regime. The gold is worth about $28 million at
its current value.

   Explosions caused by a leaking liquid
propane pipeline destroyed 10 homes today and injured six people,
officials said. ``It looks like somebody dropped a bomb,'' a
utility spokesman said.
   The explosions shattered windows in the rural town of Blenheim,
about 40 miles southwest of Albany, and knocked out telephone
service and electricity. Trees were burned and farmland was singed.
   The Schoharie County Sheriff's department said no one was killed
in the explosions shortly before 8 a.m.
   ``When it first happened, we thought an airplane had crashed
into the side of the hill,'' said resident Liz Mace. After a second
explosion, she looked out the window ``and the hill behind my home
was on fire.''
   The leak in the 8-inch underground pipeline apparently caused
propane to seep into a small valley where 10 homes are located,
said State Police spokesman Ed Dwyer.
   Firefighters put out the fires in three hours, but the pipeline
was still reported leaking at midday.
   ``There was a big explosion,'' said Jim Gately, whose home was
destroyed. ``Glass flying all over, it landed on the floor. My
clothes was afire. I jumped in the shower.''
   ``It's quite a scene,'' said Chris Becker of the Middleburgh
Telephone Co. Just unbelievable ... The houses in that area are
completely devastated. It looks like somebody dropped a bomb.'' ''
   Two people were taken to Albany Medical Center where they were
in critical condition with burns on their face and hands, said
hospital spokesman Andrew Foster. Four other people were being
treated at other hospitals.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, trying his hand at African
peacemaking, called today for early negotiations to end
Mozambique's 10-year civil war.
   Bush issued the plea after talks with Joaquim Chissano, the
president of the former Marxist state.
   At a departure ceremony after talks in the Oval Office and over
lunch, Bush said Chissano's government has taken ``significant
steps to heal divisions which threaten your nation. And we urge all
parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as to avoid further
suffering.''
   He praised Chissano for strengthing ties with the United States
and adopting reforms on voting, property rights and religious
freedoms, but said more needs to be done.
   ``We look forward to even further reforms,'' the president said.
``So we talked today of common concerns like refugee issues and
Mozambique's humanitarian concerns _ the crisis in humanitarian
concerns, I might add.''
   Chissano said he assured Bush that his government was ready to
enter into direct talks with rebel forces as soon as possible. He
also said he expressed appreciation ``for the stand the United
States has taken on the war in Mozambique and for the positive role
it has been playing in the peace process.''
   Chissano appeared taken aback by the crush of television cameras
on hand to witness the start of his Oval Office visit.
   As the crews pushed their long boom microphones toward his face,
Chissano asked, ``What do you do with all these photos? It's too
many.''
   The media people were ushered out as Bush and Chissano, seated
in wingback chairs by the fireplace, began their talks in private.
   A U.S. official who briefed reporters about today's visit said
the government of Mozambique and the RENAMO rebels were nearing
agreement on starting peace talks.
   ``I believe they're in a pre-negotiating stage right now to
determine the framework for their talks. And we're hoping that they
will take the final step to get together,'' said the official, who
spoke Monday on condition of anonymity.
   RENAMO, an organization vilified by human rights groups for its
brutality in the civil war, has been demanding that the Mozambique
government abandon Marxism-Leninism and establish a multiparty
system.
   Mozambique, which gained independence from Portugal in 1975, has
dropped its Marxist ideology and turned to private enterprise and a
free-market economy in recent years. As a reward, Bush recently
struck the country from the U.S. list of Marxist states, opening
the way for lending and trade concessions.
   ``It is our belief that because so many of RENAMO's demands have
been met already, it should not be too difficult to enter into a
negotiated settlement in the near future,'' said the official.
   Attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last
year, with the presidents of Zimbabwe and Kenya mediating.
Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen and other U.S. officials
also have been trying to help.
   The United States reportedly has a seven-point plan that would
meet both sides' preconditions for talks.
   ``We have been acting as a facilitator. And we will be wanting
to consult with President Chissano at this time to see what more we
can do to help the start of direct negotiations,'' said the
official.
   The war has been a costly one. An estimated 3.2 million
Mozambicans have been driven from their homes, either to internal
or external exile. The international community has had to give
Mozambique $300 million to buy food every year.
   Created originally by the white South African government to
counter the Mozambican government's support for the African
National Congress, RENAMO has in recent months lost much of its
ideological and financial support.
   When President F.W. de Klerk came to power in South Africa last
year, he stopped assistance to RENAMO. He since has dropped the ban
on ANC and has made overtures to its leadership designed to lead to
talks about the future of the apartheid racial discrimination
system.
   RENAMO still gets money from sympathizers in Portugal and Brazil.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles on
Tuesday defended his appeal to older nuns and priests to test an
experimental AIDS vaccine, saying that ``the common good''
sometimes requires taking risks.
   Archbishop Roger Mahony also said he had been questioned about
his appeal by Vatican officials but that they were not concerned
after learning details of the plan.
   Critics say the prototype vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk,
father of the polio vaccine, could accidentally infect the
volunteers with the deadly AIDS virus.
   Acting on a request from a scientist at the Norris Cancer
Institute at the University of Southern California, Mahony sent a
letter last month to 1,400 priests and 2,400 nuns in his diocese,
asking them to consider volunteering to test the vaccine, he said.
   ``If we wait to try something when every single risk or negative
effect has been eliminated or reduced, we would be immobilized as a
human society,'' he declared Tuesday.
   Mahony spoke at a news conference called to discuss the appeal,
which has generated controversy. The archbishop was on a visit to
Rome on separate Vatican business.
   He said his request to the clergy was ``reasonable'' and part of
the church's ``heroic tradition of outreach'' to the sick. He said,
however, that the move seemed unprecedented, at least in the United
States.
   ``I thought this was a special opportunity for the church ... to
make a contribution _ even though a small one _ in this battle
against this terrible dreaded disease,'' he said.
   He added that the experimental vaccine seemed to be ``the only
window of opportunity'' in fighting AIDS.
   Mahony said the appeal did not imply a change in the church's
teaching that homosexual behavior was wrong. AIDS is most commonly
transmitted through sexual activity or the sharing of hypodermic
needles by drug abusers, and many victims are homosexuals.
   The archbishop rejected any suggestion that the church was using
the experiment to improve its image on the AIDS' issue, declaring
the church would not ``play games with people's lives.''
   Archbishop Fiorenzo Angelini, the head of the Vatican's Pastoral
Council for Health Workers, contacted Mahony to ask about the level
of risk of the experiment, Mahony said.
   ``There had been some fears this was a highly risky venture,''
Mahony said. He added that experiments with animals had had
positive results and the vaccine was ``as safe as one can get.''
   Angelini later said that Mahony's appeal was ``a concrete
example of solidarity and charity'' and a ``positive initiative.''
   California authorities have not yet granted permission for the
study involving the prototype AIDS vaccine. A key researcher on the
project, Dr. Alexandra Levine, said Mahony acted too quickly in
sending the letters to the clergy, and that he should have waited
until the project was approved.
   The archbishop said he had been asked to make the appeal by Dr.
Brian Henderson, another leader of the experiment, and had followed
``his request and timetable.''
   Mahony, 54, also said he would consider testing the vaccine
himself, except that he was too young for the study.
   The experiment is aimed at testing the Salk prototype vaccine on
10 uninfected individuals over age 65 with long, complete medical
records. The scientists asked the clergy since the project involved
risk, Mahony said.
   At least six nuns and one or two priests have contacted
Henderson expressing interest in volunteering, the archbishop said.
   So far, Salk's prototype vaccine, called HIV-immunogen, has been
tested only on people with the human immunodeficiency or HIV virus
that causes AIDS. The Salk vaccine uses an inactivated virus, which
the scientist also used in developing the polio vaccine.
   Tests on non-infected people are controversial because, critics
say, live strains of the virus could contaminate the vaccine, and
accidentally infect volunteers.
   Such a thing happened with early tests of the Salk polio vaccine
and many Americans were infected. The vaccine eventually saved
thousands from the crippling disease.
   Levine said the tests would hopefully stimulate the immune
systems of the healthy volunteers to produce large quantities of
antibodies against the AIDS virus.
   Those antibodies would be removed from the volunteers, purified
and injected into the AIDS patients, whose immune systems cannot
produce antibodies.
   The tests could also lay the foundation for use of HIV-immunogen
as a vaccine to prevent AIDS virus infection.

   East Germany on Tuesday donated a major
collection of Nazi-era artifacts and documents to the Holocaust
museum being built here, as a museum official warned of a
disturbing increase in anti-Semitic incidents in East and West
Germany.
   East German Ambassador Gerhard Herder turned over about 500
objects related to Nazi Germany's slaughter of 6 million Jews
during World War II, saying he hoped the gift would remind ``all of
us to ensure these kind of events will never happen again.''
   The artifacts include medical instruments used for lethal
experiments at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, Judaic
textiles recovered from a Berlin synagogue during the fiery
``Kristallnacht'' pogrom of 1938, and German V-2 rocket parts
produced in underground tunnels where more than 10,000 slave
laborers died.
   The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is scheduled to open
in the spring of 1993.
   Miles Lerman, the museum's chief negotiator for Holocaust
memorabilia from foreign countries, said negotiations with East
European countries for artifacts began about three years ago, long
before Communist governments were ousted, and the agreements are
being ratified by their democratic successors.
   ``We deal with history and not with politics,'' Lerman said,
``so it doesn't matter whether we negotiate with one individual or
another. The thought of preserving these artifacts transcends
politics.''
   Lerman congratulated the East Germans for the courage to ``face
up to the past and acknowledge the crimes committed by the
generation that preceded them.'' He said the world was jubilant
over democratic changes sweeping the Eastern bloc.
   ``Jubilant,'' he said, ``but also concerned with the increasing
outbreaks of anti-Semitic acts, with signs of more prevalently
expressed wishes to turn the page and implement a historic
amnesia.''
   Lerman said there had been sporadic incidents of anti-Jewish
graffiti, desecration of tombstones and incendiary remarks by
neo-Nazis in both East and West Germany. He called the incidents
``highly disturbing'' and especially alarming to the tiny community
of 250 Jews living in East Germany.
   He said the small but vocal resurgence of anti-Semitic
sentiment, though denounced by both German governments, threatens
to undermine the democratic society the two countries are trying to
build as they prepare for reunification.
   One of the prized acquisitions donated Tuesday by East Germany
is an IBM Hollerith machine for sorting and tabulating punch cards.
A mechanical forerunner of the modern computer, the machine was
used during national censuses of the 1930s to target Jews, gypsies
and others for deportation to Nazi death camps.
   The machine was contributed by the Museum of Technology in
Dresden, one of more than two dozen East German institutions and
individuals that donated objects. A formal agreement for transfer
of the collection was signed in Potsdam in August by museum and
East German officials.
   Museum curators have received more than 10,000 gifts and 6,000
loans of artifacts and documents from Holocaust survivors or the
families of victims, and from several European governments.
   After three years of negotiations, museum officials have signed
agreements with Poland, the Soviet Union, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary to obtain Holocaust materials for
display. Talks with Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are nearing completion,
they said.
   The $147 million complex will be the largest Holocaust museum in
the world, surpassing the Yad Vashemn national Holocaust center in
Jerusalem.
   Built with private funds, the five-story museum will stand on a
1.9-acre site donated by the U.S. government near the National
Mall, within view of the Washington Monument and the Jefferson
Memorial. The museum was chartered by Congress in 1980.

   Renegade Gen. Michel Aoun said Tuesday he
was prepared to negotiate with a rival Christian warlord, and the
nation's Catholic patriarch called for government intervention to
stop the bloodshed.
   Rival Shiite Moslem militiamen fought street battles in west
Beirut, wounding 10 civilians and trapping passengers at Beirut's
airport and students in their schools, police said.
   The battles between the mainstream, Syrian-backed Amal militia
and the pro-Iranian extremist Hezbollah, or Party of God, shut the
main highway linking Beirut with south Lebanon, trapping hundreds
of people at the airport.
   Police said hundreds of students were forced to take cover in
school corridors as the militias dueled with rocket-propelled
grenades and machine guns in the dusty alleys of Beirut's southern
suburbs.
   Police also said South Yemen's ambassador was almost killed when
four rocket-propelled grenades smashed into his embassy. Police had
no other details and repeated telephone calls to the embassy went
unanswered.
   Fighting eased after Syrian troops intervened to separate the
two sides.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting for the past two years for
dominance among Lebanon's largest sect, the 1.2 million-member
Shiite community.
   More than 1,030 people have been killed and 3,046 wounded in the
clashes.
   In a newspaper interview, Aoun appealed to his Christian rival,
the leader of the Lebanese Forces militia, Samir Geagea, to end
their monthlong conflict. ``Let us sit and negotiate without
preconditions,'' Aoun said to the conservative daily Ad-Diyar
newspaper.
   Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir and the
Christian-run Voice of Lebanon radio station, meanwhile, appealed
to President Elias Hrawi's Syrian-backed government to prevent
further clashes for control of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave.
   ``The legitimate government should spread its authority over the
whole nation. It should not wait for an invitation from anyone to
do so,'' Sfeir told the leftist As-Safir newspaper.
   Geagea has demanded that Aoun step down as commander of the army
and recognize Hrawi's government.
   ``Recognizing President Hrawi is Aoun's only way to political
life,'' As-Safir quoted Geagea as saying.
   Aoun has refused to recognize Hrawi and is holding out in the
battered presidential palace in east Beirut.
   Hrawi's government controls 70 percent of Lebanon's territory
and is backed by 40,000 Syrian troops. It has no influence in the
Christian enclave.
   Syria has pledged to place its armed forces at Hrawi's disposal.
   Geagea, Aoun and Hrawi are members of the Christian Maronite
sect that has dominated Lebanon's politics since independence from
France in 1943.
   The appeals were made as Aoun's army troops and Lebanese Forces
militiamen skirmished throughout the Christian enclave, threatening
to shatter a wobbly, 10-day cease-fire.
   Police said three people were wounded by sniper fire in areas
controlled by Geagea's militia, raising the overall toll to 756
killed and 2,104 wounded since the clashes broke out Jan. 30.
   A security committee that brokered the March 3 cease-fire has
been unable to work out a political settlement to the conflict, the
bloodiest confrontation among Christians in Lebanon's 15-year-old
civil war.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronites, the Catholic community
that has enjoyed the upper hand in Lebanon's politics since
independence from France in 1943.

   Puzzled investigators probing the death of a man
who ran into the landing gear of a Boeing 727 jetliner while it
accelerated for takeoff say they may never known what brought him
onto the runway.
   Richard Lee Brown, 40, of Phoenix, died Sunday at Sky Harbor
International Airport after he confronted Alaska Airlines' Flight
608 as it was taking off for Tucson with 33 passengers and a crew
of seven.
   ``He was waving his arms around like he wanted to stop the
plane,'' police spokesman Leo Speliopoulos.
   The jetliner was moving about 100 mph and might have gone out of
control had pilot Michael Townsend tried to take evasive action,
airline spokesman Lou Cancelmi said.
   Although the plane had used up 2,000 feet of runway, Townsend
was able to abort the takeoff and stop the plane before it reached
barriers at the end of the asphalt, Cancelmi said.
   ``The captain said it was either the plane or him,'' said a
passenger, the Rev. Richard Pollard of Anchorage, Alaska.
   After the airliner returned to the terminal, Brown's body was
found tangled in the landing gear.
   Cancelmi said the crew was shaken by the incident. ``This is a
tragedy _ one we're inexperienced with,'' he said.
   Cancelmi, based in the airline's Seattle office, said crew
members spent Sunday night in Phoenix talking to police and Federal
Aviation Administration officials and flew back to Seattle on
Monday afternoon.
   And nobody knows what Brown was doing on the runway.
   ``We could postulate it was a suicide, but it could also have
been a poor guy taking a shortcut,'' said airport spokesman Steve
Bigg. ``We simply don't know.''

   They hit the ceiling at the Internal
Revenue Service when somebody smelled a rat. But the stink turned
out to be a big, dead snake in the overhead and figuring how it got
there is taxing the IRS.
   Maintenance workers found the decaying body of a 4-foot-long
snake in the ceiling Monday, after IRS workers on the sixth floor
of the federal building called for help.
   James Carmody, IRS district director, said the workers first
thought the smell was natural gas, then a dead rat. IRS agent Donna
Lodholz, who climbed a ladder to investigate, found the snake's
body and help was summoned.
   The multicolored snake appeared to be a boa constrictor, and
Carmody said a sinister motive for its presence had been ruled out.
   The snake apparently was disposed of by the maintenance crew
before it could be positively identified.
   John Groves, curator of reptiles for the Philadelphia Zoo, said
the snake could have been a species found in Pennsylvania that got
inside to hibernate for the winter. ``They don't make much noise,''
he said.
   Groves said it is possible for a snake to survive in the
building if it could find food and water.
   ``I've never noticed any rats or mice around the building, so
maybe that's the reason,'' Carmody said.

   Peavey expects more than 1,000 guests from all 50 states and
several foreign countries to attend the 25th anniversary party for
his Meridian-based company, Peavy Electronics, famed for its rock

   Company spokesman Jerry Hess said Peavey already has booked half
of Meridian's 1,400 hotel rooms for the June 12-14 event, and may
need more. The Lauderdale County Tourism Commission estimates the
party will put $420,000 into the local encomomy.
   Most guests will be dealers and distributors of Peavy products,
which the privately owned company exports to 102 countries. Peavey
also has a plant in Britain and distribution centers in Canada and
the Netherlands.
   For a grand finale, Peavey will throw an outdoor concert
featuring two single performers and two groups. Some famous people?

   Hundreds of thousands of spring breakers
are descending on Florida for beer and bikinis, but 17 American
University students are spending the week helping to build houses
for the needy.
   The eight men and nine women who arrived Sunday from Washington,
D.C., are putting in eight-hour work days, eating at churches and
spending the night in sleeping bags on the floor of the Holy
Trinity Episcopal Church.
   ``This group really wants to work,'' said Joy Willard-Williford,
project director for the South Brevard Habitat for Humanity. ``They
came with their hammers and tools and their nail aprons on. They
were all decked out.''
   The university's Habitat chapter has more than 200 members and
about 50 are spending spring break building homes in various
communities, said Kate Hochberg, 20, a group leader.
   The students plan on taking a day off Thursday. Half will head
for the beach and the others to Disney World.
   Ms. Willard-Williford said she initially suspected the students'
motives when they they asked how far they would be from Daytona
Beach, the spring break's hot spot for beery blowouts.
   As it turned out, she said, they wanted to attend an Amnesty
International rally.

   Florida Supreme Court Justice Leander
Shaw was promoted to chief justice Tuesday, becoming the first
black to hold that role in the state and the first to head any of
its three branches of government.
   ``Needless to say, it is professionally gratifying to be
elevated to serve as chief justice of our fourth largest state,''
Shaw said. ``While I welcome the challenge, I am also aware of the
awesome responsibility that accompanies such a promotion.''
   Shaw, who will be 60 in September, assumes his new
responsibilities July 1. He has served on the Supreme Court since
January 1983, when he was appointed by former Gov. Bob Graham.
   Shaw, who sided with the court's majority last year in striking
down the state's parental-consent law on abortions, has been
targeted for defeat by abortion opponents.
   He faces a merit retention fight _ a yes-no question on whether
a judge should retain office _ on the November ballot.
   Shaw's appointment to a two-year term by the rest of the high
court comes almost exactly 40 years after the state appointed its
first black judge.

   Record high temperatures in the 70s and 80s made Tuesday feel
like a day in June across much of the East, drawing winter-weary
people outside to sidewalk cafes and lunch-time strolls and
boosting sales of outdoor toys.
   ``That's the end of winter,'' said Danko Orbanich, sitting on
the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.
   Not necessarily. A storm hit Colorado and Wyoming with enough
snow Tuesday to snarl traffic and cut air traffic in half.
   More in keeping in warmer seasons, thunderstorms broke out
across Illinois and the southern Plains and generated tornadoes
that caused minor damage in Kansas.
   ``This is just a preview of spring,'' David Koehler, a National
Weather Service meteorologist in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``There's still a
possibility we can get some snow before the end of winter, but if
we do, it won't stay around long.''
   Most record high temperatures are reported in the heat of the
afternoon, but Grand Rapids, Mich., started out the day with a
record-tying 68 degrees at midnight.
   Some other early records were 85 degrees at New York City, where
temperatures a week ago were in the low 30s; Philadelphia and
Atlantic City, N.J.; 86 at Newark, N.J.; and Chicago tied its
record of 70.
   New York's reading was 38 degrees above normal, 14 degrees above
the record for the date set in 1929. It also was the city's warmest
day since Sept. 11, when the high was 91, and the earliest that the
temperature has reached 80 degrees in Central Park since record
keeping started in 1869.
   ``It's wonderful, it's great. Only problem is that if it gets
cold again everything that's blooming now is going to die,'' said
mounted Baltimore policeman David Eastman, 44.
   The unseasonable heat wave was great for anyone whose business
had anything to do with the outdoors, like Eddie Morrocco, whose
Morrocco's Italian Restaurant in downtown Washington, D.C., opened
up its outdoor tables.
   On Sunday, Morrocco said, they had no business outside.
   ``I've been doing outside business for at least 30 years and
we've never been able to open (outside) in March. Never,'' Morrocco
said.
   Merchants in South Carolina reported increased sales of
Frisbees, volleyball sets, tennis supplies and baseball and
softball equipment.
   ``The way the weather has been lately we've been selling more
walking shoes than anything else,'' said Kirk Hackett, assistant
manager of a shoe store in Fort Mill.
   The warm weather had people calling for service on their air
conditioning or to get replacement air conditioners in North
Carolina.
   ``We're swamped,'' said Ben Crabtree, in charge of the service
department at a heating and air conditioning company in Knightdale,
outside Raleigh.
   But it wasn't good business weather for everybody.
   ``The heating oil business is a dead soldier. It's deader than
George Washington,'' said Dick Jones, warehouse manager at an oil
company in Raleigh.
   And some outdoor activities also suffered.
   Lenny and Robin Wayne, tourists from Los Angeles visiting New
York City, took a few spins around the Rockefeller Center ice
skating rink, but left early. ``It's too hot to ice skate,'' Wayne
said.
   The hot air spawned thunderstorms that rained golfball-size hail
on northwestern Illinois and posed threats of new flooding in soggy
Vermilion County, where 55,000 residents remained without water
service because flooding put water pumps out of action.
   Some of the 200 people forced from their homes because of
flooding along the North Fork River north of Danville returned home
to check damage. An estimated 19 mobile homes and cabins along the
river were destroyed.
   In the West, 5 inches of wet snow had fallen by midday at
Cheyenne, Wyo., just a week after a storm shut down much of
southeastern Wyoming.
   Denver's Stapleton International Airport had 3 inches by morning
and 13 inches had fallen at Wolf Creek Pass in southwestern
Colorado. Rush-hour traffic was slowed to a crawl, and Stapleton
cut its departures by more than half because of winds and poor
visibility.
   On the Plains, thunderstorms battered parts of Kansas, Oklahoma
and Texas with rain and wind.
   Kansas also had tornadoes that damaged some homes and buildings
but caused no severe injuries, authorities said. At least 10 homes
were damaged near Topeka and power lines were down in other parts
of Shawnee and Jefferson counties.
   ``There were at least two homes that were a total loss and a
number with varying degrees of damage, such as roof damage and
glass breakage,'' said Ken Burgett, director of emergency
preparedness in Shawnee County, Kan.

   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Tuesday dissolved a
political alliance with the center-left Labor Party in a crisis
brought to a head by President Bush's comments on the status of
Jerusalem.
   Shamir fired Vice Premier Shimon Peres, the Labor leader, and
the 10 other Labor ministers submitted their resignations after an
impasse was reached on whether to accept U.S. proposals for talks
in Cairo with a Palestinian delegation.
   The two major parties immediately sought allies from among the
small ultra-Orthodox religious factions that control the balance of
power in advance of a no-confidence vote scheduled Thursday in the
Parliament.
   Labor and the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement appealed to the
Supreme Court to change the parliament vote to Wednesday. The
appeals were to be considered Wednesday morning.
   Labor's departure from the government won't take effect for 48
hours, leaving the door open for a compromise to preserve the
coalition which has ruled Israel through two stalemated elections
since 1984.
   Shamir, asked if he still wanted to save the coalition, said on
Israel Television: ``If I could I would. The whole world knows that
the idea of a national unity government is precious for me. But
this does not depend on me.''
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said that ``as long as there is
life there is hope, but I really am not very optimistic about a
compromise.''
   Peres, who also held out little hope for patching up
differences, raised the possibility of avoiding new elections by
forming a Labor-led government with ultra-Orthodox and left-wing
parties.
   ``We do hope to continue the peace process. We think there is a
chance, but I cannot say this is certain, to form a coalition to
continue the peace process,'' Peres said.
   The balance of power was held by two ultra-Orthodox religious
parties who held seven of the 120 seats in the Knesset, or
parliament. Labor and its allies control 55 seats, while Likud and
its partners control 58.
   One of the parties, Agudat Israel, announced that it would back
Labor in the no-confidence vote. The other, Torah Flag, was
undecided.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Labor, who has favored trying
to preserve the National Unity government, blamed the crisis on
Shamir's refusal to accept a last-minute compromise to join Labor
in accepting the proposals put forth by U.S. Secretary of State
James A. Baker.
   `I am very sorry about it,'' Rabin said. ``I believe we were
close and ... we could have finished a resolution that included a
positive answer to U.S. Secretary Baker if the Likud was ready to
do so.''
   In an interview on Israel radio, Shamir said Jerusalem was the
sticking point with Labor and bristled at Bush's equating of Jewish
neighborhoods in Arab east Jerusalem with West Bank settlements.
   ``The Likud stands steadfast that Jerusalem isn't part of Judea
and Samaria (the West Bank),'' said Shamir, adding he would not
agree to the 140,000 Jerusalem Arabs being involved in elections or
a proposed self-rule plan for the occupied territories.
   Jerusalem, he said, is an issue ``about which we are very
sensitive, especially these days when we hear voices from the
United States.''
   Baker proposed Palestinians from east Jerusalem take part in a
Palestinian negotiating team and subsequent elections.
   Shamir opposed the involvement, saying it would prejudge
Israel's claim to east Jerusalem, which was captured from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East War.
   Aides said Shamir was not adamant on the issue until March 4,
when Bush said U.S. aid to Israel would be influenced by whether
Israel continued to build ``new settlements'' in the West Bank or
east Jerusalem.
   Pazner, a top Shamir aide, said differences between Labor and
Likud over east Jerusalem were brought to a head.
   ``Suddenly, with President Bush's statement Jerusalem became the
central and main issue of the whole peace process. From there
things started to snowball,'' Pazner said. ``It's a pity that
President Bush raised this issue at this very delicate time.''
   Mark Heller, an independent political analyst at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said U.S.
officials had mishandled the Jerusalem issue, giving Shamir backing
for a hard line on an issue in which Israelis were united.
   ``In terms of tactics and timing, Bush and Baker were badly
advised,'' Heller said.
   Defying U.S. policy, Likud Housing Minister David Levy laid the
cornerstone Tuesday for a new 3,500-unit apartment complex in the
new Jerusalem suburb of East Pisgat Zeev, which is being built on
war-won land.
   ``They are preaching to us about Jerusalem, casting doubt on our
desire that in our capital another wall will not be erected that
divides east and west,'' Levy said.
   Asked at a news conference in Washington whether he regretted
his statements, Bush said, ``No, I don't regret it,'' but said he
would not elaborate because the issue was ``so sensitive, and it's
so emotional.''
   Palestinians, who also adopt a hard line in demanding east
Jerusalem as the capital of a proposed Palestinian state, described
the Israeli government collapse as a setback for peace.
   In Cairo, PLO representative Saeed Kamal accused Shamir of
``futile actions aimed only a wasting time.''
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said ``I believe Israel has killed
its own peace plan ... and this will have very dangerous
repercussions throughout the Middle East.''
   Freij alluded to predictions that without an active diplomatic
process, Arab-Israeli tensions would increase and result in
violence, both in the occupied territories and from radical
Palestinian groups abroad.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Sank to Five-Year Low in 1989, Government Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Tuesday that the deficit
in the broadest measure of U.S. trade sank to a five-year low last
year, but the $105.9 billion imbalance still pushed the country
deeper into the hole as the world's largest debtor nation.
   America's current account balance narrowed by 16 percent over a
$126.6 billion deficit in 1988, reflecting growth in exports,
higher overseas earnings of American businesses and increased
spending by visiting foreign tourists, according to the Commerce
Department.
   The year ended on a positive note as the October-December trade
deficit declined to $20.57 billion, down 10.2 percent from its
third quarter level. It was the smallest quarterly imbalance in
almost six years.
   But private economists were unimpressed, contending that even
with the improvement the current account deficit remained above
$100 billion for the sixth consecutive year as the United States
plunged further into hock to the rest of the world.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most closely watched trade statistic because it measures not
only trade in merchandise but also trade in services and
investments. It reflects the amount of money the United States must
borrow annually from foreigners.
   America began the 1980s as the world's largest creditor nation.
It ran surpluses in its current account as the earnings on overseas
investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise
trade.
   But as Americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners
to pay for imported cars and television sets, the investment
cushion eroded and disappeared altogether in 1985, when the United
States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   The government calculates that the total debt stood at $532.5
billion at the end of 1988. Tuesday's report indicates that it
increased to close to $640 billion by the end of 1989, although the
official accounting will not be made until June.
   America's total debt is expected to top $1 trillion in the next
few years as the current account deficit remains stuck around the
$100 billion level.
   Foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than Americans own
overseas, a development that has triggered debate over whether the
United States is losing control of its economic destiny.
   President Bush, like Ronald Reagan, has insisted that the growth
of foreign investment in the United States is a sign of strength,
showing that America remains an attractive place for investments.
   Many private economists fear, however, that Americans' living
standards will be lowered in future years as more and more dollars
flow into foreign hands to meet interest and dividend payments on
the growing debt.
   ``The United States is the world's biggest debtor and that is a
big problem for the country,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of
the Boston Co. ``Increasingly, the ravages of debt are showing up
in this country.''
   Sinai said that the need for the Federal Reserve to keep
interest rates high enough to attract foreign capital had already
translated into slower growth in the United States.
   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted that
the current account would actually worsen in 1990, after two years
of improvement, reflecting slower growth in exports and a higher
U.S. oil bill.
   ``Most of the improvement in trade occurred in early 1988 and
since then things have essentially stalled out and we expect them
to stay stalled,'' he said.
   The 1989 current account deficit was the smallest since a $104.2
bilion deficit in 1984. It was down from an all-time high of $143.7
billion in 1987.
   The merchandise trade deficit narrowed 11 percent to $113.25
billion as a 13.4 percent jump in exports offset a 6.4 percent rise
in imports.
   The surplus in the services and investment category jumped by
41.3 percent to $21.65 billion, reflecting increased foreign travel
in America and higher earnings by U.S. companies operating abroad.
   The third segment of the current account, U.S. foreign aid and
pension payments to Americans living abroad, added $14.28 billion
to the deficit last year.
   In the fourth quarter, the $20.57 billion deficit was the
smallest since the first quarter of 1984 and compared to a $22.91
billion deficit in the third quarter.
   Analysts said much of the improvement in the final three months
of the year came from a decline in the value of the dollar, which
increases the earnings of U.S. companies operating abroad when the
foreign currency earnings are translated back into dollars.
   In a second report Tuesday, the Commerce Department said that
retail sales dropped 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted $146.5
billion in February.
   While the decline was the steepest in four months, analysts said
the weakness was confined to auto sales. Other retail
establishments reported healthy gains.

   The record-holding Guinness world record-holder
muscled his way through another peculiar pastime Tuesday, cranking
out 1,551 squat-thrusts in a single hour. Then he was ready for
some exercise.
   ``I feel fantastic,'' said Ashrita Furman, 35, who lost two
pounds and almost fainted while performing before awestruck
observers in a Manhattan gym. ``I want to go out running, to kind
of loosen up.''
   Furman has walked, hopped, run, rowed, pogosticked,
somersaulted, bent, balanced and yodeled his way to a dozen entries
in the U.S. edition of the Guinness Book of World Records.
Squat-thrusts, once certified, will make it 13.
   ``The guy is amazing,'' said Robert Fuchs, owner of the Natural
Physique Centre, who kept count and checked Furman's form as the
stuntman sweated out his routine. ``I don't think he's human. It
was incredible.''
   ``He's phenomenal,'' said David Boehm, U.S. editor of the record
book. ``He's only one of a number of what you might call nuts
setting these records. But he wanted to have more records than
anybody else, and he does.''
   Squat-thrusts are produced by squatting with hands on the floor,
thrusting the legs out and back, drawing them in, then standing
erect. Furman did more than one every two seconds, resting after
each 40 squats.
   ``It looked like every muscle in the guy's body was about to
collapse,'' said Fuchs, a 26-year veteran of the bodybuilding
business. ``He was lying over the counter on his rests, or hanging
on the door to get fresh air. You think he's going to pass out and
then, bingo, he starts out fresh.''
   ``It was very intense,'' allowed Furman, a health food store
manager. ``I almost fainted around 600. ... I have some bloody
blisters on my hands. ... It was such an intense thing I didn't
feel the blisters until it was over.''
   Sound like fun? Consider Furman's earlier feats, which include
underwater pogosticking in the Amazon River, somersaulting 12.5
miles, running 50 miles while juggling three balls, yodeling for 27
hours, doing 2,550 deep knee bends in an hour and walking 32.9
miles while balancing an open pint bottle of milk on his forehead.
   ``When you edit this book, you're never astounded at anything
these people do,'' sighed Boehm. ``If you met Ashrita not knowing
about the records, you'd say he was quite sane.''
   There is a method, in fact, to Furman's peculiar pastimes.
``Sure, some of these things are totally stupid,'' he said. ``But
it's the principle of the thing. There's a lot of determination and
concentration involved.''
   A former couch potato who now boasts 15-inch biceps, Furman
credits his prowess to meditation, which he gently urges that
others try. ``I'm trying to show people they have much more
capacity than they think they have,'' he said.
   There's personal satisfaction, as well: ``It's such a fulfilling
thing. I love the intensity of it,'' he said. ``It's like one of
the most pure forms of experience you can have. Sort of like being
out on the battlefield.''
   There are other wars to come: Furman plans this June to
pogostick up the 1,760 stairs of the CN Tower in Toronto. And he's
aiming to recapture the Guinness running-while-skipping-rope record
he recently lost.
   Furman also held and then lost the squat-thrust record he claims
to have regained Tuesday, and he has no illusions about 1,551
squats _ 51 better than the old record _ standing for long.
   ``I'm sure this is going to be broken, That's the point of
this,'' he said. ``That's the point of humanity. Records were made
to be broken.''

   Black groups fought with
police and each other throughout South Africa, and 22 people were
killed, more than 100 wounded and 500 arrested, police said Tuesday.
   Police listed more than 60 incidents on Monday and Tuesday, the
largest number on the daily report since violence erupted last
month in black areas across the country. More than 200 blacks have
been killed since early February, most of them in factional
fighting.
   In the southeastern province of Natal, the site of four years of
fighting between rival groups, police said eight black men were
stabbed, shot or burned to death in three separate attacks.
   Elsewhere, four black men were killed in separate incidents when
police fired birdshot to disperse stone-throwers in the Cape and
Orange Free State provinces, the report added.
   Also, seven blacks were killed in a series of attacks in
townships around Johannesburg and the bodies of three blacks who
had been fatally shot were found in the Orange Free State, police
said.
   Most of the injuries occurred in Natal and the Witbank township
east of Johannesburg. Those arrested were picked up at
demonstrations in and around Cape Town and in the Orange Free State.
   The unrest report also listed instances of arson and attacks
against black policemen and their homes. Militant activists
consider black police collaborators with the white-run government
and often target them for attack.
   Apart from Natal, where about 3,000 blacks have been killed
since 1986, there was relatively little unrest prior to last month,
when President F.W. de Klerk legalized more than 60 black
opposition groups and released black leader Nelson Mandela.
   ``Instead of bringing responsibility, this freedom is being
misused,'' Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok told Parliament in
Cape Town.
   Vlok compared the recent unrest to the nationwide violence of
the mid-1980s, which led the government to declare a state of
emergency in June 1986.
   De Klerk has said he wants to lift the emergency, but won't do
so unless the violence subsides.
   Some of the battles involve bitter political rivalries, but
elsewhere the conflict is between taxi groups battling for control
of routes, young gangs with no political affiliations, and ordinary
criminals taking advantage of chaotic circumstances.
   The government has said the violence jeopardizes efforts to open
negotiations on a new constitution that will include black-white
power sharing.
   Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen on Tuesday
urged black leaders to ``fulfill their responsibilities at the
negotiation table.''
   ``We are waiting for you,'' Viljoen told the legislative
assembly in the black homeland of KwaZulu.
   Viljoen praised homeland leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi for his
``consistent contribution to the facilitation of the negotiation
process.''
   The relatively conservative Buthelezi, whose supporters have
been fighting more militant black groups in Natal Province, says he
is ready to begin negotiations with the government.
   The African National Congress guerrilla movement, the country's
leading black opposition group, said last month it would send a
delegation ``as soon as possible'' from its exile headquarters in
Zambia to hold preliminary talks with the South African government.
The ANC still has not set a date for the arrival of its delegation.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday saluted Mozambique's
march toward democracy and economic reform, urging President
Joaquim Chissano to begin talks ``at the earliest opportunity'' to
end the 10-year-old civil war.
   Chissano assured Bush that his government was already taking
steps ``to enter into a direct dialogue'' with the RENAMO rebels as
soon as possible.
   Chissano, whose African country has abandoned Marxism and
shifted its sights toward the West, congratulated Bush on U.S.
efforts ``to promote peace and democracy in southern Africa,''
especially Namibia and South Africa.
   Bush, at a departure ceremony after talks in the Oval Office and
over lunch, offered a strong endorsement of Mozambique's reforms,
which he said had also ``buoyed the Mozambique peace process.''
   ``For that, Mr. President, I salute you. Yet we look forward to
even further reforms,'' said Bush, who expressed concern about the
millions of Mozambicans suffering from both the war and drought.
   ``We urge all parties to talk at the earliest opportunity so as
to avoid further suffering,'' he said.
   Chissano, who became president in 1986 after Samora Machel died
in a plane crash, said his government had put forward a draft
constitution that would provide for universal sufferage, including
direct election of the president and the People's Assembly.
   Chissano called his reception at the White House ``another giant
step forward'' for Mozambique. It came five years after a
path-breaking visit by Machel to Washington during the Reagan
administration.
   Chissano, speaking English, said he told Bush ``of the decision
of my government to enter into a direct dialogue with RENAMO as
soon as possible, and about the measures already taken to bring
this decision into effect.''
   Chissano expressed appreciation ``for the stand the United
States has taken on the war in Mozambique and for the positive role
it has been playing in the peace process.''
   RENAMO, an organization vilified by human rights groups for its
brutality in the civil war, has been demanding that the Mozambique
government abandon Marxism-Leninism and establish a multiparty
system.
   Mozambique, which gained independence from Portugal in 1975,
formally abandoned Marxism last summer. As a reward for embracing
private enterprise and a free-market economy, Bush recently struck
the country from the U.S. list of Marxist states, opening the way
for lending and trade concessions.
   Attempts at getting the two sides to stop their war began last
year, with the presidents of Zimbabwe and Kenya mediating.
   Chissano expressed the hope the United States would ``spare no
effort until peace, stability and economic prosperity are achieved
in the region of southern Africa.''
   An estimated 3.2 million Mozambicans have been driven from their
homes, either to internal or external exile during the civil war.
The international community has had to give Mozambique $300 million
to buy food every year.
   Mozambique, on the southeast coast of Africa, has a population
of 15 million.
   RENAMO was created originally by the white South African
government to counter the Mozambican government's support for the
African National Congress. However, South Africa's new president,
President F.W. de Klerk, has cut off assistance to RENAMO and
recognized the ANC.

   President Bush, declaring that he has gone the
extra mile to free American hostages, said Tuesday people will be
``very, very fascinated'' when the whole story comes out about his
hoax telephone call from a purported Iranian leader.
   Bush refused to provide any details about efforts to free the
hostages, but said his administration has sought information from
everywhere, even ``going around back alleys'' to learn about the
captives' plight.
   He told reporters at a White House news conference that his
decision to accept a telephone call from an impostor claiming to be
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani was an example of his
willingness to pursue all leads.
   ``I think the bottom line is, you have to say, would you do it
again based on the information you had? And I'd say, yeah, I
probably would. ... I will go the extra mile.
   ``And when the whole story comes out on this, you all are going
to be very, very fascinated with the details. Very fascinated.''
   The president took the call several weeks ago after a man
identifying himself as an Iranaian official contacted the White
House to say that Rafsanjani wanted to talk about the American
hostages in Lebanon. The captives are thought to be held by
pro-Iranian Moslem Shiites.
   At the State Department, meanwhile, an official with knowledge
of the hostage issue said he knew of no recent developments that
could signal freedom soon for the eight Americans and 10 others in
Lebanon.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, ``We
have been told numerous times from the highest levels that there is
nothing.''
   Asked what he knew about Bush's telephone call, the official
said, ``It came from Tehran and it came from a government building
but nobody knows who it was.''
   Bush's aides have not ruled out the call was instigated by a
faction within the Iranian government.
   Peggy Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held
American hostage, said she ``wouldn't be surprised'' to see new
developments about the hostages.
   Mrs. Say, who recently went to the Middle East on a mission to
gain Anderson's release, said she believes Iran has started on a
course that will eventually lead to freedom for the captives.
   Iran, she said, is under growing international pressure to do
something about the hostages before it receives aid from the West
to rebuild its country, devastated economically by an eight-year
war with Iraq.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, will mark his fifth year in captivity on Friday.
   Bush denied rumors spawned in Tehran that he or his aides had
tried for a month to get in touch with Rafsanjani.
   ``He's got some political problems at home and we understand
that,'' the president said.
   The Bush administration's official policy on the hostages is
that it will not negotiate with the hostage-holders or their
patrons. At the same time, officials say they are willing to talk
with anyone about the hostages.
   Last week, Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman, said the
administration was encouraged by Rafsanjani's reported statement
that he would like to see the hostages freed soon.

Murder</HEAD>

   Hikers have found the skeleton of a 70-year-old
man who was sought in the September slaying of his wife, a case
featured on the television show ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' authorities
said.
   Joe Frisino of the King County medical examiner's office
identified the man Monday as Joe Lynn Owens. The cause of death
remained undetermined pending an autopsy.
   ``It's a sad ending to a sad case,'' said homicide Sgt. Joe
Ritter. ``I wish he would have at least left something to tell us
why he did it.''
   Owens disappeared Sept. 7, the day after police questioned him
about the disappearance of his 78-year-old wife, Gladys. Her body
was found Sept. 14 under a false floor below a compost pile at the
couple's west Seattle home after police acted on tips. She died of
a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
   King County police Maj. Jackson Beard said investigators were
called to a trail about 30 miles east of Seattle on Sunday after
two hikers found a human back bone.
   Police searched the area Monday and found more bones, clothing,
Owens' hearing aid, glasses and a gun.
   When questioned about Mrs. Owens' disappearance, Owens told
relatives his wife was going to school in Canada and told neighbors
she had gone to Kansas to visit relatives.
   He was questioned Sept. 6 after a neighbor told police of the
conflicting accounts. Detectives then learned Owens had told his
wife's nephew she had taken an overdose of pills and he had buried
her on family property.
   When detectives returned to question him Sept. 7, he was gone.
Police got a search warrant and found Mrs. Owens' body a week later.
   Owens was charged in absentia with first-degree murder.

   Voters went to the polls Tuesday to decide
whether to recall the mayor who led last month's unsuccessful drive
to ban fur sales and three other city councilmen criticized as rude
and hostile to growth.
   The election came exactly one month after a record turnout of
voters defeated by a 2-1 margin a proposal to make this Rockies
resort the nation's first furrier-free town.
   Deputy city clerk Jan Carney predicted a turnout of about 60
percent of the city's 3,850 registered voters. The Feb. 13 election
drew 71 percent of voters.
   Morning turnout appeared to be lighter than in February but was
difficult to gauge because there were more polling places this
time, she said. A heavy snowfall would not deter many voters, she
said.
   ``This is Aspen,'' Carney said. ``They should be celebrating
that we have snow. It's not cold or nasty, just a little sloppy.''
   The highly publicized anti-fur campaign by four-term Mayor Bill
Stirling and three city councilmen attracted animal rights
activists from as far away as Sweden and England to the chic
mountain town.
   The targeted councilmen were Steve Crockett, Frank Peters and
Michael Gassman.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Those hoping to oust a majority of the five-member council
accused the recall targets of being rude and unresponsive to
constituents' concerns.
   But the election involved more than personalities.
   Some longtime residents believe Aspen has lost its soul in
becoming a playground for the rich and famous. But recall
supporters said efforts to save Aspen by limiting growth have
become exclusionary and nasty.
   Aspen's population is said to peak at about 20,000 in the
winter. Many property owners do not live here full time, and real
estate prices have skyrocketed during the past decade.
   Residents voted last month for growth, defeating by 1,561 to
1,051 a measure to reduce the size of a luxury hotel by 25 percent,
and approving measures to widen the highway leading into town and a
bond measure to build affordable housing for employees.
   The winners hailed the results as a victory for free enterprise.
Losers said the mood in the town, home of ``gonzo'' journalist
Hunter S. Thompson and other eccentrics, had taken a lurch beyond
the bourgeois.
   Aspen was the first U.S. community to pass a tough anti-smoking
ordinance and the first to declare itself a nuclear-free zone.

   President Bush on Tuesday dismissed the idea
that his statements on Jerusalem had contributed to the shattering
of Israel's governing coalition, while the administration postponed
promoting Mideast talks until Israel forms a government ``capable
of making these decisions.''
   Bush and others in the administration declined to offer
judgments on the Israeli situation. But the president held firm to
his statements describing East Jerusalem as occupied territory.
   ``I don't regret it,'' Bush said of his statement that also
declared the predominantly Arab section of the city off-limits to
Jewish ``settlers.''
   ``I was reiterating U.S. policy,'' the president said.
   He told a news conference his statement had been blown out of
proportion by speculation and commentaries.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, asked by young Jewish leaders
about the U.S. policy on Jerusalem, said the United States believes
Jerusalem should remain a united city but that the question of who
controls it should be tackled as the last step of Arab-Israeli
peace negotiations.
   Citing the dissolution a few hours earlier of the Israeli
government's political coalition, Bush said: ``I will answer no
more. ... It is so sensitive, so emotional, any further speculation
on this question would not be useful given what has happened in the
last few hours.''
   The collapse of the Israeli Cabinet followed acrimonious debate
about the U.S. formula for talks with Palestinian Arabs and Bush's
March 3 statement in Palm Springs, Calif.
   ``I don't want to look in any way (like) we are trying to mingle
in the internal affairs of Israel as they are going through this
difficult period,'' Bush said Tuesday.
   On Sunday, amid acrimonious debate, Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir declined to put the U.S. plan for Israeli talks with
Palestinian Arabs in Cairo to a vote by the 12-member inner Cabinet.
   With the collapse of the government on Tuesday, the State
Department acknowledged the U.S. plan, which included roles in the
talks for a Palestinian with a home in East Jerusalem and another
deported by Israel from the West Bank, could not move ahead.
   ``Obviously, there is a political crisis in Israel, and until
that is sorted out, Israel won't be in a position to make a
decision,'' spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said. ``The government
of Israel is now working through its own political process and will
sort out its own situation. We obviously will be watching this
process closely, and I am not going to make any other comments on
internal political developments in Israel.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who worked on the plan
for eight months, is committed to promoting negotiations, the
spokeswoman said.
   But, she added, ``it is not our place to make decisions for
Israel, and our ability to support and move forward on peace
depends upon an Israeli government capable of making these
decisions.''
   Bush's earlier statement was taken both by the Likud coalition
and the Labor party as a challenge to Israel's retention of East
Jerusalem, held by Jordan for 19 years until it was won by Israel
in the 1967 Mideast war.
   Asked if the statement contributed to the political crisis in
Israel, spokeswoman Tutwiler replied: ``Absolutely not.''
   She said Baker would not abandon his effort, and she invited
anyone who has a better plan to implement Shamir's proposal for
elections on the West Bank and in Gaza to make it known.

<HEAD>Jail Officials Stop Dangerous Practice</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Orange County jail officials have ended a
practice of hog-tying violent inmates and sandwiching them between
mattresses since the death of a prisoner who was restrained for
more than three hours.
   Jail Director Tom Allison said a jail committee had recommended
halting the ``mattress sandwich technique'' in August, but that he
ignored the advice until inmate Ricky Richardson, 31, died Dec. 30.
   ``Obviously, with the death of Richardson, we have reconsidered
that,'' Allison said Monday. ``We are not using that system right
now and probably will not use it in the future.''
   His family alleged in a federal court suit against Orange County
and the jail that Richardson's death was caused by ``inhumane,
unjustifiable ... and grossly disproportionate'' treatment.
   Jail officials said they acted appropriately in hog-tying and
sandwiching Richardson for 3{ hours because he had bitten,
scratched and kicked guards during two violent outbursts. He was
found unconscious by jail guards and died less than an hour later.
   An initial autopsy suggests Richardson was not suffocated or
beaten to death and did not die from an AIDS-related condition, but
was running a potentially fatal 108-degree fever when he died, said
Medical Examiner Thomas Hegert.
   In August, the jail's Planning, Accountability and Control
Committee recommended that an alternative method be used to
restrain violent inmates.
   Allison said he did not follow the committee's recommendation at
the time because ``we really didn't see enough reason to
discontinue the mattresses.''
   The alternative method, which involves strapping an inmate's
wrists, ankles, midriff and head to a specially designed bunk, is
effective only for a short time because the straps can chafe or
work loose, he said.
   Allison said the best way to restrain violent inmates is to
sedate them, but only hospitals are permitted to do that. He said
he will ask state officials to let jailers forcibly sedate such
prisoners.

   Mayor Marion Barry's statement Tuesday that he
is chemically dependent on two tranquilizers _ Valium and Xanax _
would make him a member of a rather large group of Americans who
have abused the drugs, experts say.
   ``It's quite common,'' said Dr. Rudolf Hoehn-Saric, an associate
professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University. ``Both are
quite addictive drugs.''
   Valium and Xanax have a variety of legitimate uses and are
prescribed to relieve stress, anxiety, panic attacks and enhance
sleep and relax muscles.
   Barry, who commented after returning Washington after treatment
for chemical dependency, did not say if the pills had been
prescribed. Aides have said Barry's major problem was alcholism.
   The mayor, who left Washington seven weeks ago to begin
treatment, faces five misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession and
three felony charges of perjury before a grand jury.
   Gene Haislip, deputy assistant administrator for the Drug
Enforcement Administration's office of diversion control, says the
two drugs are among the pharmaceuticals most frequently diverted
from the legitimate market.
   A total of 9.5 million Americans surveyed in 1988 for the
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse said they had used
tranquilizers _ including but not limited to Valium and Xanax _
non-medically at least once in their lives, according to Mona Brown
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
   In addition, 1.2 million Americans said they had used such drugs
non-medically in the 30 days before the survey was conducted, Brown
said.
   In 1988, use of Valium was mentioned in 6,082 emergency room
cases and Xanax was reported 3,846 times, according to NIDA.
   One prominent case occurred in February 1987, when former
presidential adviser Robert C. McFarlane, under investigation in
the Iran-Contra scandal, attempted suicide with an overdose of
Valium.
   Valium and Xanax are rarely fatal when taken alone, ``but if you
mix them with alcohol, they can be deadly,'' Hoehn-Saric said,
adding that Valium is the more addictive.
   ``It gives you a quick high,'' he said. ``People who are
addicted are looking for that high.''
   Xanax, meanwhile, is ``like a drink here and there to help
relieve stress,'' he said. ``But if it's used frequently _ like
morning, noon and night _ it becomes addictive.''
   Hoehn-Saric said Valium withdrawal can mean sleeplessness and
anxiety. If the person has been taking high doses, he said, ``it
could cause seizures if you withdraw too fast.''
   Dr. Brian Doyle, a clinical professor of psychiatry at
Georgetown University Hospital, said it takes six to 12 weeks to
get off the drugs for people who have been taking it under medical
supervision in appropriate doses. Recreational users taking higher
doses need longer, he said.
   In recent years, physicians have reduced their prescriptions of
Valium as they became aware of the addiction potential, Hoehn-Saric
said.
   The use of the tranquilizers were so widespread during the 1970s
that it became part of the popular culture and a subject for humor.
   In a memorable scene from the 1977 movie, ``An Unmarried
Woman,'' starring Jill Clayburgh and Alan Bates, a department store
crowd is asked if anyone has a Valium. Everyone in sight
immediately reaches for his or her personal supply.

   The Communist Party leadership in this tiny
hilltop republic voted Tuesday evening to change the party name and
its hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   The vote by the party chiefs in this Appenine Mountain country
of 22,500 residents marked the latest defeat for communism
following the 1989-90 revolutions that coursed through Eastern
Europe.
   The Central Committee voted 13-12 to rename the party the
Democratic Progressive Party and replace its symbol with a dove
portrayed against the towers on the three main mountains of the
world's oldest republic. The 12 dissenters Tuesday night wanted a
different name: Democratic Party of Work.
   The party rank-and-file will vote on the new name and symbol at
a congress April 26-28.
   The Communist Party claims about 1,300 members in this
23-square-mile republic, which is surrounded by Italy near the
Adriatic.
   Although the Communists fared well in the last general elections
in 1988, increasing from 24 percent to 29 percent of the vote, the
Central Committee was unanimous on changing the name.
   The Communists are the country's second-biggest party after the
Christian Democrats. They have ruled together in coalitions in the
past.
   San Marino, founded in the year 301, depends on tourism, postage
stamps and financial services as chief sources of income.

   The first of 25 police officers
charged in the bloody crackdown on dissent that began
Czechoslovakia's November revolution against Communist rule went on
trial Tuesday.
   First Lt. Jaroslav Oudran pleaded guilty before a military court
in Terezin, 40 miles north of Prague, on charges of ``abusing power
of a public official.'' Oudran faces a prison term of up to ten
years.
   Riot police on Nov. 17 brutally dispersed tens of thousands of
protesters peacefully commemorating the 50th anniversary of the
death of Jan Opletal, who protested the Nazi occupation of
Czechoslovakia in 1939.
   As the protest drew to a close, about 2,000 people were blocked
and beaten by police. The repression triggered the uprising that
eventually toppled the hard-line Communist regime of Milos Jakes.
Former dissident Vaclav Havel was later elected president.
   Prosecutors said Oudran beat onlooker Katerina Vavrova _ hitting
her in the face, grabbing her by the hair and pounding her head
against the stone pillar of an arcade at least four times. When she
fell to the ground, he allegedly kicked her in the hip.
   Vavrova, 29, could not work for three months, the prosecution
said.
   ``I cannot tell you exactly what kind of a sentence he will get
until all the evidence is heard,'' prosecutor Miroslav Janzura said.
   The prosecution said a verdict was expected Wednesday.
   During the crackdown, about 590 people were injured, including
dozens of foreign journalists, according to Josef Stank, head of a
security commission investigating the police action. He was quoted
by the daily, Lidova Demokracie.
   The Prague Communist Party boss during the crackdown, Miroslav
Stepan, was arrested Dec. 23. Stepan, who faces charges of ``giving
orders ... to abuse power of a public official,'' is expected to be
tried in March.
   Stepan is the only civilian in custody in connection with the
Nov. 17 events, and Oudran is the first of the 25 police officers
to be tried.

<TEXT>
   Opposition parties Tuesday appealed
for a postponement of Romania's first free postwar elections,
saying the country is still crippled by oppression and unprepared
for democratic balloting.
   ``Please tell us who is ready to take power today. Take it and
go ahead,'' interim President Ion Iliescu responded to opposition
delegates at a parliament session to pass an election law for the
scheduled May 20 vote.
   Minutes earlier during a break in the session, Iliescu had been
handed a letter asking for the election delay. The letter was
signed by 23 opposition parties, including the National Peasants
Party and the National Liberal Party, the two largest.
   Most of the parliament's work Tuesday focused on taking steps to
try to prevent a future president from becoming a dictator,
including barring candidates who committed abuses under Nicolae
Ceausescu's hard-line Communist government.
   The letter was the boldest move yet by the opposition campaign
to postpone the elections, which would be the first free vote in
Romania since 1937.
   Iliescu had told delegates earlier Tuesday that authority to
change the election day rested with the government led by interim
Premier Petre Roman, not with him.
   The letter did not propose a new date but Ion Radu Zilisteanu of
the National Democratic Party suggested a three-month delay.
   The opposition has claimed a fair vote was not possible so
quickly after the December revolution that toppled Ceausescu,
especially with the continuing political dominance of the National
Salvation Front.
   The Front seized power in the chaos of the revolution and formed
a provisional government with Iliescu as interim president. It
relinquished part of its power last month to the interim
parliament, known as the Council of National Unity, after the Front
decided to become a full-fledged political party and run in the
elections.
   ``The electorate is not prepared for free and democratic
elections because of the climate of insecurity and oppression that
is maintained in the country, fueled by ill-meaning elements,'' the
letter said. It did not identify those elements or give examples of
oppression.
   ``The process of socially and politically cleansing society from
the active elements of the previous dictatorship is at an
impasse,'' the letter said.
   It also said opposition parties had not had access to media to
promote their proposals to solve the nation's social, economic and
political problems.
   However, the opposition parties also stressed support for the
government's efforts during the transition period to elections.
   Earlier Tuesday, parliamentary delegates voted to bar certain
people in Ceausescu's regime from running for president. They
include anyone who committed abuses in political, judicial or
administrative functions, violated human rights, or took part in
repression by the police or the Securitate, Ceausescu's hated
secret police.
   The draft electoral law provides for candidates to be challenged
in court on their record under the former dictator.
   Another prime concern of the 258-member Council was preventing a
future president from becoming a dictator.
   ``The president does not have the right to become eternal,''
said Mircea Dinescu, president of the Writer's Union and one of the
first to announce Ceausescu's overthrow on Dec. 22 after 24 years
of repressive rule.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed on Christmas Day
following a secret military trial.
   The first role of the parliament that will be seated following
elections will be to write a new constitution. Within a year from
then, Iliescu said, the parliament should pass a permanent election
law ``to avoid any suspicion that ... somebody could take power for
25 years.''
   The Council delegates _ representing the 51 political parties
created since the revolution as well as ethnic groups _
overwhelmingly approved the provision.

<TEXT>
   The House Government Operations Committee
approved a bill Tuesday that would elevate the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet level with creation of a Department of
the Environment.
   Similar legislation earlier had been approved by a Senate
committee and now heads for floor action in both the House and
Senate.
   President Bush wants Congress to pass the legislation in the
coming weeks so that an announcement on creating a Cabinet-level
department for environmental issues can be made in time for the
celebration of Earth Day on April 22.
   The legislation, which passed the committee on a voice vote
Tuesday, has widespread bipartisan support in both the House and
Senate.
   Supporters of the House and Senate bills argue that creating a
Department of the Environment will put the EPA on equal standing
with other agencies and departments in government and give the
president's chief environmental adviser more prestige when dealing
with other countries.
   The bills in both houses also would create a center for
environmental statistics, which would consolidate and improve the
collection of environmental data.
   Congressional staffers said the legislation otherwise would not
envision any sizeable increases in the size of the EPA if it gains
department status.

   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' led the news
ratings for the ninth consecutive week, according to A.C. Nielsen
Co. estimates released Tuesday.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' and the ``CBS Evening News'' tied for
second place.
   An ABC spokesman said the margin of victory for ``World News
Tonight'' was the highest in the program's history. Of the three
newscasts, only ABC's program, anchored by Peter Jennings,
increased its audience.
   For the week that ended March 9, it averaged an 11.5 rating, up
0.4 point from the previous week. NBC's broadcast and CBS's, which
has been slumping in the ratings, each averaged 9.7.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   Compared to ratings for the same week a year ago, last week's
ratings showed a 16 percent drop for CBS' newscast, according to
ABC estimates.
   Anchored by Dan Rather, the once-dominant ``CBS Evening News''
was third in each of the three weeks preceding the latest Nielsen
estimates.

<HEAD>U.N. Representative Says Contras Can be Disbanded by April 25</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY CHENAULT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. monitor for Nicaragua said Tuesday
he believes the Contra rebels can be disbanded by April 25, when
Violeta Barrios Chamorro takes over as president.
   Elliot Richardson, an observer of Nicaragua's election process
for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said a U.N.
plan to disarm and resettle the U.S.-backed rebels will guarantee
their safety.
   ``I think that practical safeguards for their demobilization can
be provided,'' he said at a news conference.
   The Contras have said they will remain armed to make sure the
leftist Sandinista government of President Daniel Ortega, which
they fought, hands over control of the military and police as well
as the presidency.
   But Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general, said he believes
``the prospects are good'' the Contras will be disbanded before the
formal transfer of power.
   He said the incoming and outgoing governments, as well as the
United States, are willing to work together to ensure the Contras
``can safely demobilize and re-enter the society of Nicaragua, or
for that matter if they choose to, stay outside of Nicaragua.''
   Richardson said he could not provide specifics on the plan
because ``it would be inappropriate to try to fill in details on a
matter that is in fact actively being pursued now.''
   Perez de Cuellar plans to report this week to the U.N. Security
Council on proposals to expand the mandate of the U.N. Observer
Group in Central America to include overseeing efforts to disarm
and possibly repatriate the Contras.
   In November, the Security Council formed the observer group to
verify the cutoff of outside aid to rebel movements in the region.
It was also created to patrol international borders to prevent
guerrillas attacks.
   The original mandate called for a 625-member force, but U.N.
officials say the broader role involving the Contras would require
a substantial increase in personnel. There have been estimates a
force of 1,000 would be needed.
   Last week, Ortega threatened to keep control of the military and
the security police unless the Contras disbanded before the
swearing-in ceremony on April 25. The Sandinistas lost control of
the government in Feb. 25 elections.
   However, Ortega told Vice President Dan Quayle at a Monday
meeting in Chile that he would not block the smooth transfer of
power.
   President Bush announced Tuesday in Washington he had lifted a
five-year trade embargo against Nicaragua and asked Congress to
provide $300 million quickly to help speed the transition to
democracy.
   The president never mentioned the Contras, who received millions
of dollars from the United States during the Reagan administration.
But his aid request includes about $45 million to help pay costs of
relocating about 10,000 Contra rebels and tens of thousands of
relatives from camps along the Honduran border to Nicaragua.

   The Congress of People's Deputies on Tuesday
approved Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proposals for a multiparty
political system, headed by a powerful president, to replace
decades of absolute Communist Party domination.
   But opposition deputies charged that the Soviet leader seriously
violated parliamentary rules in ramming the proposals through a
procedural muddle, and demanded that the issues be brought up for
one more vote.
   Failing that, they said the Congress likely would balk later
this week at naming Gorbachev the new president, forcing him
instead to face voters in the country's first nationwide
presidential election.
   Tuesday's vote, if upheld, will mark the definitive movement of
the Soviet Union from more than 70 years of party leadership toward
a more representative government system closer to that of many
Western nations. It came five years after Gorbachev took over power
in the Soviet Union _ a tenure marked by growing economic
difficulties and sometimes-violent ethnic unrest, but also improved
relations with the West.
   ``I congratulate the Congress,'' Gorbachev said simply after
applause greeted the vote of 1,817-133 members of the nation's
highest parliamentary body for establishing the new post of
president. Moments later, the 2,250-member Congress voted 1,771-164
to approve a wide-ranging bill striking the Communist Party's
leading role from the Constitution, legalizing some forms of
private property and setting the presidential powers.
   Gorbachev has said the strong presidency is essential to hold
the country together as it goes through economic troubles and
ethnic disputes.
   He picked up votes for his proposals during the day by offering
a compromise on some of the most controversial presidential powers.
He gave up the right to appeal a veto override and promised that
any bid to impose a state of emergency would be preceded by an
official warning and prior approval of local authorities.
   Deputy Fyodor Burlatsky, a top political commentator, said
Gorbachev probably picked up 50 to 100 votes with the compromise.
   Each piece of legislation required 1,501 votes _ a two-thirds
majority of all the members of the Congress, present or not.
Gorbachev had been threatened by a boycott from some Baltic
legislators who consider their republics independent, and
opposition from radical reformers who considered the post of
president too powerful and demanded a direct election.
   The bill gives the president the power to propose legislation,
negotiate treaties, veto legislation and decisions of the Council
of Ministers, appoint a Cabinet, declare war if the country is
attacked and impose presidential rule.
   ``We are standing before the greatest, most meaningful step in
the history of our government,'' he told deputies shortly before
they voted. ``This is a major step in favor of democracy and the
protection of democracy.''
   Gorbachev opened Tuesday's session in a relaxed manner, even
joking about Lithuania's declaration of independence on Sunday.
   During the afternoon session, however, he was strongly in
control. He tapped a glass with his pencil and stabbed at the air
to move the debate toward a vote.He cut off debate at several
points with a a curt ``That's enough,'' or ``Just a minute,'' and
several times resorted to a voice vote on whether the Congress
wanted to continue a particular debate.
   At one point after the vote was taken on both the presidency and
the constitutional amendments, Deputy Arkady Murashev, a leader of
the opposition Inter-regional Group of legislators, took the
microphone and said deputies were confused by the procedure.
   Gorbachev responded that each deputy spoke for himself in the
Congress and then asked: ``You're talking about yourself, you?''
   The Soviet leader then added it was too late to be confused
about a vote already taken. ``When a question arises, clarify it,''
he told Murashev in a belittling tone.
   One reform-minded deputy who is considered an expert on
parliamentary procedure told reporters at the close of Tuesday's
session that Gorbachev had ``absolutely distorted'' parliamentary
procedure, and that reformers would demand the issue come up again
for a final ballot.
   ``I'm not sure our leadership is ready to accept this demand
about voting procedure,'' said Moscow deputy Sergei Stankevich.
   But the official Tass news agency said that while the Congress
endorsed the post of president and ended the party's leading role,
one more vote would be needed after all amendments are considered.
   The Congress began considering amendments to the two bills only
after it approved them. Since presidential rule and a multiparty
system already had been approved as amendments to the Constitution,
the new amendments required a two-thirds vote instead of a simple
majority.
   That meant that two amendments presented by radicals were
defeated even though they received a majority of votes. Deputies
voted 1,067-906 for an amendment that would have struck all
references to the Communist Party from the Constitution instead of
adding a reference to other parties.
   They voted by a wider margin, 1,303-607, to make Gorbachev
choose between the post of president and a leading role in the
Communist Party. But both amendments, like those approved earlier,
would have required 1,501 votes to pass.
   Stankevich said he did not know whether Gorbachev maneuvered the
Congress into a tight spot on purpose, but that two of his top
aides, Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov and Yevgeny M. Primakov,
chairman of the parliament's Soviet of the Union, ``understand very
well the situation.''
   If Gorbachev grants a repeat vote, he is likely to lose support
because of frustration over how he handled the procedure,
Stankevich said. If he fails to, he may fail to win approval to
have the Congress elect the first president this week.
   Asked for a prediction on Gorbachev's bid to conduct an
immediate presidential election in the Congress, Stankevich said:
``I think it will be rejected.''
   Gorbachev has said he will run for the post, and he faces no
serious opposition in the Congress. However the outcome of a
nationwide vote is less certain.
   Many Soviets are increasingly frustrated with Gorbachev's
inability to improve the economy and have expressed their
disappointment by turning out top leaders in other competitive
elections.

   Former White House aide Oliver L. North on
Tuesday undercut a defense attempt to show that John M. Poindexter
was unaware of a 1985 missile shipment to Iran, saying he kept his
boss apprised of the operation.
   Poindexter's lawyer, Richard Beckler, took North through a
half-hour series of questions about how the former National
Security Council staff officer helped obtain a CIA aircraft to ship
18 Hawk missiles owned by Israel to Iran.
   At each stage, Beckler asked if Poindexter participated with
North in any of the discussions with Israeli or CIA officials that
preceded the November 1985 shipment.
   North testified that Poindexter, then President Reagan's
national security adviser, was not a participant in those
discussions.
   Beckler was trying to show that Poindexter wasn't lying when he
told Congress that he learned about the shipment more than a month
after it occurred.
   But his point was undermined when he asked North: ``Adm.
Poindexter was not assisting you in carrying out this mission, he
was not working with you side by side, was he?''
   ``I do not recall the admiral being on the phone with me, as you
just asked, but I did keep admiral apprised of what I was doing,''
North said.
   North, meanwhile, disclosed that he urged a trip by a U.S.
official, perhaps Vice President Bush, to visit Iran in 1986 as
part of the effort to free American hostages.
   There was no indication from the testimony that the proposal was
seriously considered and North testified that Poindexter opposed
the idea.
   Beckler also produced a handwritten note by Poindexter that
stated that he had briefed Reagan about a shipment of Hawk missile
spare parts that cost the Iranians $15 million.
   The document is the first indication that Reagan may have been
informed at the time of the Iran initiative of the actual prices
the Iranians were paying for the weapons.
   The prices were exorbitant and at least $3.8 million from the
Iran arms sales was diverted to the Nicaraguan Contras, according
to a report compiled by Congress.
   Reagan maintains he didn't know there was any extra money being
generated from the Iran arms sales. He most recently made that
assertion last month in a videotaped deposition for Poindexter's
trial.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing congressional inquiries
into the Iran-Contra affair by making false statements and
destroying documents.
   Among other things, Poindexter is accused of lying by telling
Congress he was not aware of the Hawk missile shipment until more
than a month after it occurred. He is also accused of concealing
the covert assistance to the Nicaraguan Contras and diverting
U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the rebels.
   North said he discussed the proposal for a trip by American
officials to Iran in a Feb. 27, 1986, memo to former national
security adviser Robert C. McFarlane, then working as a White House
consultant.
   The proposal was for ``an advance trip to Iran to arrange for a
high-level trip later on by a senior U.S. official, possibly even
the vice president, to meet with the leadership of Iran,'' North
testified.
   North said Poindexter was not ``very enthusiastic'' about the
idea, so he had written McFarlane to ask him to ``importune the
admiral so this trip could be undertaken.''
   ``I thought the advance trip was worth the risk and the admiral
didn't,'' North said.
   In May 1986, North and McFarlane traveled to Iran in an
unsuccessful attempt to secure the release of American hostages in
the Middle East.
   Beckler produced North's message to McFarlane to try to show
that North sometimes went behind Poindexter's back. The memo said:
``Have not told JWP that this note is being sent.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene voiced concern about the
note, saying it undercut North's prior assertions that he always
kept Poindexter abreast of what he was doing.
   ``You are the one who keeps telling us and other tribunals and
other juries that all you were doing was following orders. Here you
are communicating with an outsider and you say your immediate boss
would not be told about this.
   ``Was this consistent with your general method of operation?''
the judge said.
   North insisted that he was not trying to hide anything from
Poindexter, merely trying to get McFarlane to change Poindexter's
mind about undertaking the mission to Iran.
   Even though McFarlane had left government, he ``still stayed
engaged'' in assignments for Reagan, North said.
   ``You decided when to call him or did somebody tell you?''
Greene asked.
   ``I don't know who decided,'' North said. ``I believe it was the
president.''
   ``Were you the one to decide when to send'' the message to
McFarlane? Greene asked.
   ``I don't recall anybody telling me not to,'' North replied.
``Nobody told me I shouldn't talk to him about this.''

<HEAD>Ireland Refuses Extradition of IRA Prisoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ireland's Supreme Court on Tuesday
refused to extradite two escaped prisoners to Northern Ireland
saying there was a risk they would be assaulted by prison staff in
the British-ruled province.
   The two men were freed after the hearing.
   Dermot Finucane and James Pius Clarke escaped from Belfast's
Maze Prison in a mass Irish Republican Army breakout in 1983.
   Both were serving 18-year terms when they escaped; Finucane, 30,
for firearms offenses and Clarke, 34, for the attempted murder of a
member of the Ulster Defense Regiment, a mainly Protestant,
part-time regiment of the British Army.
   Ireland's Chief Justice Thomas Finlay said Finucane risked being
``assaulted or injured by illegal action by prison staff at the
Maze'' if he were returned.
   ``I am satisfied that this court has to protect his
constitutional rights,'' he said.
   The chief justice's ruling was unanimously supported by a panel
of five judges of the Supreme Court, Ireland's final legal
authority.
   After the decision was read Finucane was ordered released. He
was immediately ushered out of the court by supporters and sped
away on a waiting motorcycle.
   Clarke was later released, following a separate court action,
but on similar grounds. He walked out of the court calling the
ruling ``brilliant.''
   Finucane had claimed in earlier hearings that other prisoners
involved in the mass IRA breakout from the Maze Prison were later
subjected to harsh treatment by prison officers.
   Kenneth Maginnis, spokesman for the Official Unionists, the main
Protestant party in Northern Ireland, said the suggestion that the
men risked assault in prison was ``absolute nonsense.''
   He said the Supreme Court decision ``spells the death knell''
for the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the 1985 accord which gives Dublin a
say in the running of Northern Ireland.
   ``Irrespective of how the two governments try to give it the
kiss of life, it is probably dead on its feet,'' he said.
   A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Office, a branch of the
British government, said: ``We are obviously disappointed that
Finucane and Clarke will not be returned to Northern Ireland to
complete their sentences.''
   The two men were arrested in Ireland in 1987 and have been
battling extradition since.
   Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the IRA, welcomed the
court ruling, calling it ``a victory for all those who have fought
so valiantly against the extradition of political dissidents to
Britain.''
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule of Northern Ireland and
to unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly
Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   Japanese investment in U.S. real estate, which
had been posting huge annual gains, edged down 10.7 percent in
1989, reflecting a higher Japanese interest in Europe, a study said
Tuesday.
   Japanese real estate investment totaled $14.77 billion last
year, compared with a record high of $16.54 billion in 1988,
according to figures compiled by Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., an
accounting firm that specializes in real estate.
   ``The Japanese have started to devote more attention to Western
Europe both in terms of real estate as well as other investments,''
the report said.
   The study attributed the switch to an effort by the Japanese to
take advantage of the 1992 target date for the removal of trade
barriers inside the 12-nation European Community.
   Hotels and resorts were the most popular real estate purchase
for the Japanese, accounting for 28 percent of the total. Office
buildings, which had been No. 1 with 50 percent of the total in
1988, fell to second place, accounting for 23 percent of spending
last year.
   Three states _ California, Hawaii and New York _ accounted for
81 percent of total investment, up from 62 percent in 1988.
   For the second year in a row, California ranked No. 1, with 36
percent of real estate investment last year, about two-fifths of
which was concentrated in Los Angeles. Hawaii accounted for 30
percent of total investment, followed by New York with 16 percent.
   Nevada jumped into fourth place with $482 million in investment
last year, reflecting primarily purchases of hotels and resorts in
Las Vegas.
   The focus of Japanese interest remained in metropolitan areas.
   By city, Los Angeles accounted for $2.51 billion in investment
in 1989, 17 percent of the total, followed by New York with $2.3
billion, 16 percent of the total.
   Other cities and their percentages of 1989 investment were: San
Diego and Honolulu, both at 7 percent; Anaheim, Calif., and Las
Vegas, both 4 percent; San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Houston,
and Phoenix, Ariz., all at 2 percent.
   In a separate report Tuesday, the Association for International
Investment said that total direct investment put the Japanese in
the No. 2 spot at the end of 1989 behind the British. They had
begun the decade in fifth place.
   The association, which represents foreign companies with
subsidiaries in the United States and U.S. businesses with foreign
operations, said 35 percent of the Japanese investment was in
businesses engaged in wholesale trade while 23 percent was in
manufacturing and 19 percent in real estate.

   Martin Marietta Corp. officials say
``all systems are go'' for Wednesday's launch of a commercial Titan
rocket that will send an uninsured $140 million communications
satellite into orbit.
   ``We are delighted with the weather. So far, everything looks
very good,'' Edward M. Browne, president of Martin Marietta
Commercial Titan Inc., told reporters Tuesday.
   ``We intend to push the button at 6:49 a.m. in one millisecond
and get that sucker off the ground.''
   It will be Martin Marietta's second commercial launch and only
the third by an American company.
   Martin Marietta entered the commercial launch business Dec. 31
by thrusting into orbit British and Japanese communications
satellites with the big Titan 3 rocket, the type scheduled for
liftoff Wednesday. The rocket went up on its 10th attempt following
delays due to winds and a technical problem.
   This time, the Titan will be carrying a 5-ton Intelsat VI
communications satellite that will replace two satellites over the
Atlantic Ocean. The Intelsat VI satellite, nearly four stories tall
with its antennas and solar panels deployed, will transmit up to
120,000 telephone calls and three television channels for more than
13 years.
   The cost of the satellite and launch is estimated at more than
$270 million.
   Barring problems, the rocket was scheduled to blast off between
6:49 a.m. and 7:04 a.m. from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
There was a second launch opportunity an hour later lasting 29
minutes.
   Martin Marietta spokeswoman Judy Stowell said Tuesday there was
more than a 95 percent chance of favorable weather.
   Once the satellite reaches final geosynchronous orbit 22,300
miles above Earth on Sunday, the satellite will be near the first
Intelsat VI, which was launched in October by the European Space
Agency's Ariane rocket. That satellite is undergoing in-orbit tests
before being placed in service April 7.
   The second Intelsat VI is scheduled to start service in late May.
   Frederick Ormsby, spacecraft mission director for the
International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, or
Intelsat, said last month's explosion of an Ariane rocket should
not affect plans to launch two more Intelsat VI satellites on
Ariane boosters next year.
   The unmanned Ariane rocket, which was carrying two Japanese
communications satellites, blew apart over the Atlantic shortly
after taking off from Kourou, French Guiana. The accident prompted
Arianespace, which runs the program, to suspend all Ariane launches
pending an investigation.
   The third in the series of five Intelsat VI satellites is
scheduled to be launched aboard a Titan 3 by Martin Marietta in
June.
   Ormsby said Intelsat had not insured the satellite being
launched Wednesday. Insuring such spacecraft is prohibitively high,
especially since the Ariane explosion.
   The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the
most powerful U.S. commercial rocket and the second big American
rocket to enter the commercial market. McDonnell Douglas was the
first, with its Delta rocket hoisting a communications satellite
for British Satellite Broadcasting last August.
   General Dynamics plans to enter the competition in June with its
Atlas rocket.
   Intelsat, a Washington, D.C.-based, not-for-profit commercial
cooperative of 118 member nations, owns and operates a global
communications satellite system used by more than 170 countries.
Wednesday's launch will be its 44th. The first Intelsat
communications satellite was launched 25 years ago next month.

<HEAD>Bush Says Voters Shouldn't Hold Past Marijuana Use Against
Candidate</HEAD>

   President Bush said Tuesday he does not think
past use of marijuana should be held against someone running for
political office.
   He declined further comment concerning other drugs or the Texas
governor's race in which questions of drug use have been a major
issue.
   The question arose at Bush's news conference when a reporter
asked the president's views on Tuesday's gubernatorial primary in
his adopted home state of Texas.
   Democratic candidate Ann Richards, the state treasurer, said she
was a recovering alcoholic and her ``addiction was alcohol'' but
lost ground in public opinion polls after repeatedly refusing to
say whether she had ever used illegal drugs.
   Asked if he felt past drug use should be held against a
candidate, Bush said, ``That's a matter for the voters to decide.''
   But the president added, ``In my view, (if) somebody used
marijuana sometime ago and is not into anything of that nature,
why, no, I don't think that should be held against them.''
   He refused to elaborate when asked if he felt that way about
harder drugs, too.
   ``You're getting me involved in the Texas primary, something I
don't want to do,'' he responded.
   Bush voted by absentee ballot in the Republican primary.
   ``I will not tell you who I voted for and I hope everybody
understands,'' he told reporters. ``Otherwise, we'll have a quiz
around here of who we voted for earlier on. It's not a proper
question to reveal.''
   He promised to be less reticent come the general campaign.
   ``I'll be involved, but I'm not going to fine-tune that,'' said
Bush, whose son, George Walker Bush, once considered seeking the
GOP nomination to succeed Gov. Bill Clements.
   In 1987, during the Reagan administration, Douglas Ginsburg
withdrew as a nominee to the Supreme Court after admitting he had
smoked marijuana while a law professor. William Bennett, then the
education secretary and now Bush's drug policy director, played a
role in persuading Ginsburg to withdraw.
   Ms. Richards gained national prominence as the keynote speaker
at the 1988 Democratic National Convention with a speech taking
humorous jabs at Republican presidential candidate Bush.
   In one of the most quoted, she said he had been born ``with a
silver foot in his mouth.''

   Police arrested disabled demonstrators who
chanted slogans and chained their wheelchairs together in the
Capitol on Tuesday in a protest demanding quick passage of a bill
guaranteeing their civil rights.
   The arrests came after deliberate acts of civil disobedience by
the demonstrators and a confrontation in the Capitol's cavernous
Rotunda with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Minority Leader
Robert H. Michel.
   Police said 104 people were arrested.
   Removing the demonstrators and loading them into vans took
police about two hours. Those who could walk were handcuffed, and
some in wheelchairs were strapped into their seats by police, many
of whom wore surgical gloves.
   Those arrested were charged with two misdemeanors, unlawful
entry and demonstrating within the Capitol, said police spokesman
G.T. Nevitt. Both carry maximum sentences of six months in jail.
   In addition, those convicted could be fined $100 for unlawful
entry and $500 for demonstrating in the Capitol.
   The arrests marked the second day of dramatic lobbying by people
with disabilities, who are seeking passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act. On Monday, some 60 people crawled out of their
wheelchairs and up the West steps of the Capitol to underline their
demands.
   The Senate passed the bill last year but the measure has bogged
down in the House despite widespread predictions of ultimate
approval.
   While the demonstration was in progress, the House Energy and
Commerce Committee approved the bill 40-3 at a meeting in another
building. But the measure still must go to two other committees
before reaching the full House.
   Demonstrators gathered in the center of the Rotunda and began to
chant slogans, including some from the civil rights movement of the
1960s. They also chanted ``ADA Now'' and ``Access Now,'' referring
to their demand for access to transportation and other
accomodations.
   ``Access is a civil right,'' the last protester, who identified
herself only as Gail Love, shouted as she was taken out.
   Police used large snipping tools to break chains that some of
the demonstrators had used to bind their wheelchairs together.
   Before the arrests, Foley assured demonstrators that he and
other congressional leaders were pushing the bill. His words were
met with skepticism.
   ``It is a priority for passage in this session of the
Congress,'' the Washington Democrat shouted over catcalls. ``I am
absolutely satisfied it will reach the floor, we will have a
conference with the Senate and it will become law.''
   ``Will it be on the floor in 24 hours? No,'' Foley added. A
chorus of boos greeted the remark.
   A sponsor of the bill, Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., also spoke to
the group and urged them to be patient. ``Sixty days is not too
long'' to wait, he said. He was met by shouts of, ``We've waited
too long already.''
   The bill would outlaw discrimination based on physical or mental
disability in employment, access to buildings, use of the telephone
system, use of public and private transportation and in other uses.
It would require ramps or other means of access in all new
buildings used by the general public, including private businesses
and offices.
   The Capitol building has ramps for wheelchair access to two of
its entrances and ramps and elevators inside.
   During the midday confrontation in the Rotunda, Foley sought to
assure the disabled that House leaders ``want to see that this bill
has the greatest possible support and will reach the president's
desk in a way that he can sign it.''
   Michel, an Illinois Republican, told the crowd he had broached
the issue earlier today in a meeting with President Bush at the
White House. He called ``unreasonable'' the demand by some of the
protesters for passage in 24 hours. Some other protesters said they
were seeking passage by May 1.

<TEXT>
   A quick infusion of U.S. aid and the
end of a five-year economic embargo will give Nicaragua the
confidence to rebuild its war-battered economy, authorities said
Tuesday.
   ``This opens a lot of doors,'' said Ramiro Gurdian, leader of
the most important private business organization in Nicaragua, the
Superior Council of Private Enterprise.
   ``Investors will begin thinking about putting money into
Nicaragua because it now has access to the biggest consumer market
in the world: the United States.''
   President Bush on Tuesday lifted trade sanctions on Nicaragua
and asked Congress to quickly approve $300 million in aid.
   Gurdian said those steps should encourage private banks and
international lending institutions to begin looking favorably on
Nicaragua.
   ``It's like putting money in the pipeline and waiting for the
faucet to open,'' he said.
   Danilo Lacayo, a spokesman for the U.S.-backed United National
Opposition alliance, said the U.S. assistance also could persuade
other countries to increase their aid.
   While UNO looks to the United States to help it fulfill its
campaign promises, the leftist Sandinistas blame Washington for
their resounding defeat in the Feb. 25 elections.
   The UNO candidate, President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
is to take office April 25.
   The trade embargo imposed against the Sandinista government,
their war with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and poor management
have turned Nicaragua into one of the poorest countries in Latin
America.
   About one-third of the work force is jobless and the economy has
shrunk steadily the past six years.
   Vice President Sergio Ramirez told a news conference lifting the
embargo is a long overdue ``act of justice.''
   The Nicaraguan aid package appears to give the conservative,
U.S.-backed UNO almost everything its chief financial adviser,
Francisco Mayorga, asked for during his recent trip to Washington.
   Mayorga, a Yale-educated economist, said he would press for
quick aid to help get crops in the ground before the May rains
begin.
   Agriculture is the base of Nicaragua's economy, and Gurdian said
the end of the trade embargo means Nicaragua will be able to get
tractors, fertilizer, seed and other agricultural products cheaper
by buying directly from the United States.
   It will also be able to sell products like meat or sugar at
better prices offered by the American market, he said.
   Bush also took steps to let Nicaragua resume shipping sugar, a
major export crop, to the United States and to make Nicaragua
eligible for duty-free treatment for a variety of other products.
   Nicaragua has 30,000 sugar workers who would be affected by the
opening of the U.S. sugar market, said labor leader Alvin Guthrie.
   ``If we should get preferential prices, it would be easier to
attack certain problems like low wages,'' he said recently.
   Lacayo said the aid package should improve the climate for a
peaceful transition of power from the Sandinistas to UNO.
   The Sandinistas, who are insisting on the demobilization of the
Contra rebels before Mrs. Chamorro takes office, have been sharply
critical of the United States for not doing more to disarm the
10,000-man guerrilla army.
   Bush's aid package includes $45 million to help repatriate or
resettle the Contras, most of whom are in base camps in Honduras
near the border.

   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said
Tuesday he welcomed the White House proposal to lift economic
sanctions and supply $300 million in aid to his country, but he
called it little compared with the damage done.
   ``I celebrate this as a victory of the Nicaraguan people, who
have suffered so much. They deserve this and more,'' he said.
   ``Although it's little, considering Nicaragua's economic
circumstances, it shows a willingness to help.''
   He said he hoped the $300 million would be followed up by more
aid.
   Ortega spoke in an address to officials of the Santiago-based
U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America.
   He said U.S. aggression against his leftist Sandinista
government cost billions of dollars in economic damage.
   Ortega conversed Monday with U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle. He
said Quayle told him Bush would be making an announcement Tuesday
about the economic sanctions against his government.
   He also told reporters before his speech his talks with Quayle
had been ``very positive. It gave us an opportunity to arrive at
points of agreement about issues that have been difficult to
resolve, such as the issue of the Contras.''
   In his address, Ortega said he wanted to see the United States
apply pressure so the Contra rebels are disarmed and disbanded by
April 25.
   Aides to Quayle had said Ortega promised to peacefully and
unconditionally hand over power as scheduled on April 25 to Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, who last month beat Ortega in elections.
   ``It is time for the United States to begin changing its policy
toward Nicaragua, toward the Nicaraguan revolutionary process that
still stands and is being strengthened by democracy,'' Ortega said.
   Ortega arrived in Chile on Sunday to attend the inauguration
that day of President Patricio Aylwin, who succeeded Gen. Augusto
Pinochet. Quayle also came for the inauguration.

<HEAD>Committee Votes to Seek Immunity for Gilliam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House committee voted unanimously Tuesday to
seek a court order granting immunity from prosecution to compel
testimony from a former top official at the scandal-plagued
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   Dubois Gilliam, now serving an 18-month prison sentence for a
HUD-related conviction, is expected to testify in late April or
early May before the House panel that has spent more than a year
investigating scandals under the Reagan administration's HUD
secretary, Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   The House Government Operations Committee voted 35-0 to approve
a motion to compel the testimony, after its investigations
subcommittee voted 8-0 to seek the order from a federal court.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, said
Gilliam was being offered no reduction in his current sentence as
an inducement or deal for his testimony.
   Gilliam, formerly deputy assistant secretary and a top aide to
Pierce, has been cooperating with the committee and was ``a key
player'' in awarding grants under several HUD programs, according
to Lantos.
   A special prosecutor, Arlin Adams, is looking into allegations
of fraud and influence peddling in one of the department's programs.
   If a judge approves immunity, Gilliam could not be prosecuted
based on his testimony before Congress or information derived from
that testimony.
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, meanwhile,
defended his department's $23.7 billion budget and proposed housing
bill under critical questioning from Democrats in an appearance
before the House Banking Committee.
   Kemp said the proposal is ``serious and responsible.'' But he
acknowledged it does not provide financing for construction of new
subsidized housing.
   Kemp has labeled his housing proposal ``HOPE,'' for home
ownership and opportunity for people everywhere, and the bill was
introduced with bipartisan sponsorship Monday.
   As its centerpiece is Kemp's plan for encouraging home ownership
among low and moderate-income families.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called the proposal ``more hype
than hope'' and ``long on words and short on action.''
   ``It's a nice idea, but it's not going to create new roofs over
people's heads,'' Schumer said.
   Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., said the Bush administration's
housing budget is ``woefully inadequate'' and by failing to provide
new housing would ``allow and condone homelessness.''

   The unseasonably warm weather being enjoyed
in the upper Midwest forced part of Bruce Willis' ``Die Hard II''
production crew out of town and north to Kinross on Michigan's
Upper Peninsula.
   Twentieth Century Fox sent Willis and most of the production
crew back to Los Angeles over the weekend when the warm weather
melted snow in Alpena needed for the winter action movie.
   The temperature rose from 5 below zero March 6 into the 60s
within four days.
   Alpena itself was a substitute location for Moses Lake, Wash.,
where warm weather last month plagued producers. In January, a heat
wave interfered with planned filming at Denver's Stapleton
International Airport.
   Location manager Greg Lazzaro said producers shot only about
half of the planned winter blizzard scenes at the Alpena County
Regional Airport before snow stopped falling.
   ``We could not film in the rain, and if it continued, we would
be sitting around,'' Lazzaro said Monday.
   Beginning Wednesday, ``Die Hard II'' stunt doubles and a
secondary crew will work out of the old Kincheloe Air Force Base at
Kinross. There's still at least a foot of snow at the one-runway
airport, said Joyce DeWitt, who works for a charter service there.
   ``It's gonna take a lot of rain to wash all this snow away,''
DeWitt said Tuesday.
   A few ``Die Hard II'' crew members remained in Alpena, about 230
miles north of Detroit, on Tuesday but the prospect of snow and
cold returning anytime soon were not good. Even so, producers told
Karen Pettalia of the Alpena Chamber of Commerce that they would be
back sometime next week to finish shooting there.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials told Congress on Tuesday that
increased corruption in Thailand is the main reason for greater
shipments of heroin to the United States.
   Melvyn Levitsky, assistant secretary of state for international
narcotics matters, said he had raised the matter in private talks
in Washington with Thai representatives over the past six to eight
months.
   He said the increased corruption was centered on the border with
Burma, now called Myanmar, and that it was connected with Thai
logging operations on the Burmese side.
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., who heads a task force on narcotics
set up by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was chairman of the
hearing.
   Smith said half the heroin reaching the United States comes from
the ``Golden Triangle,'' which includes parts of Thailand, Burma
and Laos. Thailand has not been able to stop shipments from Burma,
he said.
   Levitsky called Burma the key problem, saying it had doubled its
production of opium and heroin to become the world's largest
producer.
   The State Department's annual report on narcotics, issued
earlier this month, said the members of the military who took over
Burma in 1988 have given minimum priority to fighting narcotics. It
estimated Burma's production of opium, from which heroin is
derived, at 2,625 metric tons last year, up from 770 to 1,100 tons
in 1986.
   Levitsky praised the Thai government's cooperation with the
United States, but noted that President Bush's listing of Thailand
among the countries certified as cooperating was accompanied this
year by a special note.
   ``We need to be honest,'' he said.
   Afghanistan, Syria, Burma and Iran have been removed from the
list.

   East Germany's prime minister believes the
fears of Nazi-era survivors about a resurgence of right-wing
extremism in a reunited Germany are justified, the dean of the
world's leading Holocaust research center said Tuesday.
   But West Germany's leader says penal laws should allay such
worries, said Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center for
Holocaust Studies.
   Hier wrote Prime Minister Hans Modrow of East Germany and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany to ask how they would
preserve the memory of Nazi crimes.
   Modrow agreed that Hier's concerns were ``definitely
justified,'' saying there is some basis for fears about a
resurgence of nationalism, racism and anti-Semitism in East Germany
as the countries move toward reunification.
   The right-wing Republican Party in West Germany, led by former
Waffen SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber, ``is trying to gain a foothold
here,'' Modrow said in a letter signed by his adviser, Karl Heinz
Arnold.
   But Kohl dismissed the rabbi's fears, saying in a Feb. 28 letter
that West Germans had been ``informed without any taboo of the
causes and consequences of the National Socialist tyranny.''
   ``It has probably also escaped your notice that in our Penal
Code precisely these `crimes of hatred' whose combating you
recommend to me are punishable with fines or prison sentences,''
Kohl wrote.
   ``To my mind, there is no doubt that these provisions will also
apply in a united Germany. This certainly does not require any
special demand,'' the chancellor added.
   Modrow's letter also tried to assure that ``students have a
remarkable knowledge of the events of the Nazi period which can be
conceptualized with the Holocaust.''
   But Hier said Jews around the world simply cannot trust such
assurances.
   ``My point is that after Auschwitz the Holocaust should be
institutionalized, from cradle to grave,'' he said. ``For the last
40 years it has been forbidden to talk about it. It was completely
ignored.
   ``They may have a remarkable knowledge about the Nazis, but they
may not have a remarkable knowledge about the Jews,'' he said.
``There is hardly a word of the Jew as victim.''
   Hier said the West must guard against the resurgence of
right-wing groups in a united Germany and insist that the memory of
Nazi crimes be preserved as a warning to the future.
   ``We should ask, `What will you do to institutionalize the
memory of the Holocaust? Not a single Western leader, not even
President Bush, has brought that up to the Germans,'' said Hier.
   ``The victims of Nazi Germany have a right to ask.''
   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, named for the famed Nazi hunter, is
the world's leading research institute on the extermination of 6
million Jews by the Nazis during World War II.
   Hier also condemned the ``two-plus-four'' reunification formula
worked out in Ottawa last month. The plan addresses economic and
political aspects, then discusses security issues with the United
States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
   ``I cannot understand the policy of the leaders of the West who
came up with two-plus-four,'' Hier said. ``We are afraid of
economic dominance and we are worried about military adventurism.
Yet, not a single leader has said to the Germans what they intend
to do about the memory of the Holocaust.
   ``I think we should force this issue on the public agenda. We
should ask, `What is the blueprint for the memory of the
Holocaust?'''

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
hold separate meetings next week with South African President F.W.
de Klerk and black activist Nelson Mandela, U.S. officials said
Tuesday.
   The location of the talks is not set, the officials told The
Associated Press.
   Baker is going to Namibia on Sunday to attend ceremonies marking
that country's independence from South Africa. He will use the trip
as a springboard for a round of active U.S. diplomacy.
   The officials, who demanded anonymity, said an announcement
about the talks would be made Wednesday.
   Baker also may go to Zaire to meet with President Sese Seko
Mobutu, and is trying to arrange talks with Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimba, the leader of a U.S.-backed
insurgent movement in Angola.
   De Klerk freed the 71-year-old Mandela last month after the
black leader had spent 27 years in prison. The African National
Congress, a prominent anti-apartheid organization, was legalized.
   Baker's session with Mandela is an opportunity to compare
strategies to end racial segregation in South Africa and to seek
the release of nearly 300 political prisoners. Meanwhile, a 3{-year
state of emergency in South Africa remains in place.
   Baker's meeting with de Klerk is a chance to convey the Bush
administration's terms for lifting economic sanctions against South
Africa.
   The administration has cautiously praised de Klerk for the steps
he has taken while holding out the prospect of an invitation to the
White House if he keeps on track.
   On another African problem, Baker has approached the Soviet
Union to join the United States in an appeal for a cease-fire to
allow food to reach millions of Ethiopians who face starvation.
   Baker, with President Bush's approval, wrote Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze recently ``to see what we can do
together,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said
Tuesday.
   A group of prominent black Americans urged Baker on Monday to
work with the Soviet Union and others on a cease-fire and a
suspension of arms shipments to the Marxist government and to
guerrillas locked in a civil war.
   There was no immediate word on whether Moscow had replied.
   The black group, headed by Randall Robinson, executive director
of TransAfrica, also asked Baker for up to $25 million in U.S. aid
for a leading anti-apartheid group in South Africa to help the
African National Congress begin planning a new political structure
for the country.
   Baker gave the group no commitment, Ms. Tutwiler said. However,
she praised the ANC, headed by Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela.
   ``We share many of its political objectives, such as ending
apartheid and establishing a non-racial South Africa,'' she said.
   To that end, she said, the Bush administration is prepared to
assist South African refugees as they return to the country. Also,
Ms. Tutwiler said, the United States is contributing $31.6 million
this year to prepare South Africans for leadership in a
post-apartheid democracy.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the program is administered through private
organizations.

   The military government Tuesday delayed by
one month political conventions to be held ahead of elections to
return Nigeria to civilian rule.
   A government statement said it was postponing the conventions by
one month, to July 7. No reason for the action was given.
   The ruling Armed Forces Council has created two parties to
choose candidates to run in national elections, and the winners are
to take over the government by October 1992.
   The military president, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, has said the
military will make sure former politicians will not lead the new
parties. Babangida also has said members of his government,
including soldiers, will be barred from leading parties or running
for office.

   Two suspected Basque terrorists shot
a prison worker in the head in this northern city Tuesday hours
after the Basque separatist group ETA said it may agree to halt
attacks, officials said.
   Angel Mota Iglesias underwent surgery in the Red Cross Hospital,
200 yards from where he was ambushed as he got into his car, a
government official in this Basque provincial capital said. No
immediate word came on his condition.
   No group claimed responsibility, but police found a spent
cartridge of the type normally used by ETA, the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Mota worked at a provincial prison in San Sebastian which holds
some ETA members.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has killed more than 600 people since 1968 in its
campaign for independence for the three-province Spanish Basque
region.
   In a statement published Tuesday in the Basque daily Egin, ETA
said it would halt attacks if the government agreed to honor
commitments allegedly made during talks in Algeria nearly a year
ago.
   Interior Ministry Jose Luis Corcuera said the government stood
by its anti-terrorist policy, which calls for ETA to stop attacks
before further talks.

   Space shuttle Atlantis, traveling
atop a modified Boeing 747, arrived back at Kennedy Space Center on
Tuesday, ending a cross-country journey delayed several days by bad
weather.
   The jet touched down at 5:51 p.m. EST about five miles from
where it took off 13 days earlier on a secret military mission to
send a $500 million spy satellite into orbit.
   ``After several delays, it's good to have the bird back in the
nest again,'' said National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   Both Atlantis' launch and its trip back from Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., to Kennedy were plagued by uncooperative weather.
   The shuttle blasted off Feb. 28 on its sixth attempt, one short
of tying a record for launch postponements. All but one of
Atlantis' delays was attributed to weather.
   Buckingham said the delays would not affect Atlantis' next
flight in July, another secret Pentagon mission. The shuttle was
expected to undergo several days of post-flight deservicing,
beginning Wednesday, after being removed from the jet.
   Earlier Tuesday, forecasters reported rain, poor visibility and
low clouds along much of the route. Rain is a threat to the
shuttle's exterior heat-insulating tiles.
   The weather apparently cleared, enabling the Boeing 747 to leave
Columbus Air Force Base, Miss., at 3:56 p.m. EST after a two-hour
refueling stop.
   The shuttle and jet had arrived at Columbus almost three hours
after leaving Biggs Army Airfield in western Texas, where they had
been grounded since Sunday because of bad weather. A military cargo
plane took off about a half-hour ahead of the shuttle transport to
check weather along the route.
   The military plane also took off from Columbus ahead of the
shuttle transport to ensure a safe last leg, Buckingham said.
   Atlantis and its transport had landed at Biggs on Sunday for
refueling after leaving Edwards. The shuttle and its five-member
crew landed at Edwards on March 4, concluding its 4{-day mission.
   Atlantis' astronauts successfully deployed the spy satellite on
the second day of the mission. The satellite's orbit is taking it
over parts of the Soviet Union never before photographed by a
shuttle-launched spy satellite.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle on
Tuesday asked Argentine President Carlos Menem to press Cuba for a
halt in arms shipments to leftist rebels in El Salvador, a Quayle
aide said.
   Menem told the vice president that he and other latin presidents
would encourage Cuban President Fidel Castro to ``find a democratic
way out'' of the island nation's Marxist system, said the official
traveling with Quayle on his weeklong trip to South America.
   Quayle told reporters earlier Tuesday that with the Democratic
elections last month in Nicaragua, Castro ``will get a very clear
message.''
   ``It will show the extreme isolation he's in ...'' Quayle said.
``He is the lone holdout in this hemisphere.''
   ``Castro is all by himself. He is a very intelligent individual
and I'm sure recent events will not be lost on him, but we see no
indication he's going to change,'' Quayle said.
   Menem indicated he would speak to Castro at Thursday's
presidential inauguration in Brazil, which Quayle also will attend.
   During their one-hour meeting at the Government House, Quayle
and Menem also discussed Argentina's economic problems. Menem
renewed his vow to take the hard austerity measures needed to get
his country's skyrocketing inflation under control, said the Quayle
aide who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Quayle repeated U.S. asssurances of support for Menem and
encouraged such austerity measures. There were no indications the
United States would come up with an aid package to help Argentina.
   A slide in Argentina's currency against the dollar, drastic
price markups in stores and strikes by public workers have
disrupted the country's banks, federal courtrooms and oil fields.
   The country has been beset by demonstrations and strikes in
protest over inflation, which has soared more than 8,100 percent in
the last year.
   Quayle met earlier Tuesday with Paraguayan President Andres
Rodriguez and they pledged greater cooperation between their
governments in the fight against illegal drug trafficking.
   Quayle said he also spoke to Rodriguez about human rights, labor
and U.S. trade sanctions against the country.
   Rodriguez and Quayle held their talks while sailing on the
Paraguay River in a small yacht when the vice president made a
brief stop in Asuncion en route to Buenos Aires.
   Rodriguez said at a news conference with Quayle that his
government was pledged to cooperate with the United States against
drug trafficking. Paraguay is a major transfer point for cocaine
smuggling from Bolivia.
   Rodriguez told Quayle he would increase interdiction efforts in
the nation's Chaco region, where traffickers have dozens of private
airstrips, said the official traveling with Quayle.
   Rodriguez, the official said, also promised to work closely with
the Drug Enforcement Agency and asked for training and technical
assistance that might help Paraguay's newly reorganized anti-drug
agency become more effective.
   Quayle said Paraguay would send a delegation to Washington in
June to discuss the U.S. economic sanctions imposed because of
labor rights suppression under the 34-year regime of military
dictator Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
   Quayle aides said the vice president raised concerns about labor
rights protection and that Rodriguez said such criticism by the
AFL-CIO was unjustified.
   Asked if he pressed Rodriguez on human rights issues, Quayle
told reporters:
   ``We got into a number of areas. They know what requirements are
necessary. ... There is a good appreciation of what needs to be
done.''
   In 1987, the United States excluded Paraguay from the
Generalized System of Preferences trading because the Stroessner
reigme did not comply with GSP worker rights' standards.
   Rodriguez, a military general, overthrew Stroessner in a violent
coup in February 1989. Rodriguez won the presidential election in
May.
   While he has made reforms in human rights, problems still
remain, according to the 1990 State Department report on human
rights in Paraguay. The report cited police violence against
demonstrators and detainment of leaders, slow movement on
investigating former police torturers and failure to protect
collective bargaining rights.
   Quayle said he was ``deeply impressed with President Rodriguez's
commitment to democracy.''

   A switch engine towing a line of empty
freight cars banged the rear of a halted Amtrak train early
Tuesday, setting off a chain reaction that left 31 passengers
injured and three cars derailed.
   ``It was just so unexpected; there was no warning,'' said Amtrak
employee Paul Jones, who was treated for whiplash at Nash General
Hospital. ``The car just jolted and things went flying around.''
   None of the injuries was serious.
   Three cars of the 19-car Silver Meteor from Tampa to New York
were bumped off the rails.
   Several of the 471 passengers said they were sleeping when the
collision threw them from their seats.
   ``I had just started to wake up when it hit,'' said Mary Lou
Henley of Lackawana, N.Y. ``It slammed me into the seat in front of
me and then threw me back in my seat. eople were screaming and
hollering and laying in the aisle.''
   ``I had just dropped off to sleep, then there was this awful
boom,'' said Viola Smiley of Syracuse, N.Y. ``I remember screaming
and then my neck and back were hurting. The man told us the freight
train was only going 3 miles an hour. If he'd have been going any
faster we would have all been killed. We were blessed by God, is
the best way that I can say it. Blessed, blessed, blessed.''
   CSX Transportation spokesman Linday Leckie, whose company owns
the tracks, said 31 injuries were reported. The three-man freight
train crew was unhurt.
   Nursing supervisor June Williams at Nash General said 21
patients were treated, most of them for sprains, strains and
bruises. None was admitted.
   The passengers included college students returning from Florida
vacations and a high school French club headed for Canada.
   ``We just had a student who was terrified of train rides and we
assured her nothing would happen,'' said Elma Averitte,
headmistress of the Flora McDonald Academy in Fayetteville. ``We've
got another group leaving for London today, but they're flying.''
   The passengers were put on chartered buses. The tracks were
expected to be cleared by Tuesday night.

<TEXT>
   The United States is ready to give
Australia total control of a spy base in the Australian Outback
that is used to communicate with U.S. submarines in the Indian
Ocean, Foreign Ministry officials said Tuesday.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said late Monday he discussed handing
over North West Cape base in the far reaches of Western Australia
state with U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Officials, who demanded anonymity, said Tuesday it was ``pretty
well agreed'' that Australia regain control of the base, which
began operating 27 years ago. They gave no details.
   Hawke said the base, one of three operated jointly by Australian
and U.S. personnel, was increasingly important to Australia's
defense security.
   Military analysts said the base was of less importance now to
the U.S. because the Pentagon uses longer-range missiles that do
not need to be deployed from the Indian Ocean, which washes the
North West Cape.
   Hawke made the announcement toward the end of campaigning for a
record fourth consecutive term for his Labor government. Elections
are March 24.
   His opponents said the change amounted to a political ploy.
   ``The government knew the U.S. was planmning to pull out last
year,'' said Bill Smith, whose Trade and Labor Council represents
the 200 Australian workers at the base.
   Australia Defense Association chairman Bill Harding said the
United States no longer needed North West Cape because it had
satellite-based submarine communications systems. He said Australia
had no choice in taking over the base _ at an annual cost of $30
million _ and that the announcement was timed as a political
gimmick to attract more environmentalist votes.

<TEXT>
   Six former police officers and five
accomplices have been arrested in the killings of eight people who
tried to stop drug running to the United States, authorities said
Tuesday.
   The attorney general's office said in a statement that Miguel
Angel Felix Gallardo, known as the godfather of the drug trade in
Mexico, ordered the killings, which occurred between November 1988
and March 5.
   Felix Gallardo was arrested in April 1989 and is in jail in
Mexico City, awaiting trial on cocaine trafficking and other
charges.
   The eleven people Felix Gallardo allegedly contracted with for
the killings are residents of the northwestern state of Sinaloa.
   Authorities said band members were arrested this week after a
shootout in a Culiacan suburb and are accused of murder, drug
trafficking and possession of illegal arms. he day of the arrests
was not given.
   Authorities said the band killed a narcotics trafficker known as
``El Lobito'' and another person identified only as Felipe in
November 1988.
   A former state commander of the Federal Judicial Police, Armando
Barraza, is wanted on suspicion of participating in those killings,
authorities said.
   The slayings were carried out in the Sinaloa town of El Naranjo,
according to testimony the attorney general's office took from
former judicial police agent Jose Guadalupe Graciano Aguilar. He
has been arrested, authorities said.
   One week after the El Naranjo deaths, the band killed a judicial
policeman from Sinaloa on the highway between the Pacific resort of
Mazatlan and the state capital Sinaloa, the attorney general's
office said.
   It said band members also killed two narcotics traffickers in
January this year on a Culiacan ranch.
   Graciano Aguilar testified the band killed a city policeman and
his brother on March 3 and another man on March 5, authorities said.
   In a related case, the attorney general's office announced on
Monday that three Venezuelan men and one Mexican attorney were
kidnapped Feb. 22, then tortured, killed and buried in Culiacan by
10 people in an act of revenge against Felix Gallardo.
   Union representatives at Culiacan University, where the
Venezuelans were studying and working, on Tuesday protested the
recent violence in the state, the independent news service
Excelsior reported.

   The guerrillas opened fire to calls to surrender and at least 14
insurgents were killed in the shootout, Anatolia said.

   Rebels operating in the region are linked with the Kurdish Labor

<HEAD>Widow: Doctors Said Sen. East's Problems Were Psychological</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   John East's widow testified in her lawsuit
Tuesday that the U.S. senator's health gradually worsened while
Navy doctors who were unaware he had a serious thyroid disorder
insisted his problem was psychological.
   The North Carolina Republican committed suicide in 1986, 11
months after being cured of the disorder.
   Priscilla East, 58, of Greenville, N.C., contends her husband
believed the doctors' failure to diagnose his condition for several
years had caused his mental and physical powers to deteriorate. He
left a suicide note blaming the doctors.
   In 1984, East regularly saw a psychiatrist recommended by Rear
Adm. Freeman Cary, the U.S. Capitol's attending physician at the
time, Mrs. East said.
   East ``told me, `I kept telling the admiral my problem is
physical,' and he kept telling John it was a mental problem,'' she
testified.
   Her $3.5 million claim is believed to be the first wrongful
death claim against the government by the family of a U.S. senator.
   The government contends that Mrs. East lacks medical proof that
East's decision to end his life resulted from the late diagnosis of
hypothyroidism. East killed himself in June 1986 by filling his
garage with carbon monixide.
   Doctors told East that his thyroid problem should have been
detected sooner and that they had never seen such an advanced case
as his, Mrs. East testified.
   In hypothyroidism, the thyroid gland does not produce hormones
necessary to keep the body's metabolism working properly.
   East, suffering insomnia and slowness of speech, became upset
when newspapers in North Carolina began to raise questions about
his capabilities.
   ``He was hopeful that he would snap out of this in time to run
for re-election,'' Mrs. East said. ``But there began to be articles
... (saying) that North Carolina needed two senators. I remember
one of them said, `Is he dead? Is he gone? Where is Sen. East?'
Those hit below the belt.''
   East was hospitalized at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in
April 1985, after collapsing at the couple's home. He was put under
a suicide watch on the psychiatric ward, but when blood tests
detected hypothyroidism, he was transferred to an internal medicine
ward, with no watch.
   A few days later, he tried to kill himself by jamming a chair
leg down his throat, Mrs. East testified. She said no one at the
hospital could explain to her why East had been left unguarded.
   He was hospitalized several more times in succeeding months for
other health ailments, and became deeply depressed, she said. He
had always been vigorous and athletic despite being confined to a
wheelchair by polio, she said. East was particularly unhappy about
his lack of ability to concentrate and to understand written and
spoken words.
   ``He said, `You remember the old John East?' I said sure. He
said, `I'm not the old John East I used to be. I'm just a shell of
my former self,''' she testified.
   Her attorney, James Hourihan, showed U.S. District Court Judge
Walter Black Jr. videotapes of East's appearances on news shows in
1981, 1983 and 1984. In the 1981 clip, East seemed articulate and
self-possessed. The later interviews showed him speaking more
slowly and with less animation.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Susan Ringler said in opening arguments
Monday that the anger East felt against Navy doctors before he
committed suicide was unjustified. Ringler also disputed the claim
that hypothyroidism dulled East's mental abilities, saying he led
an active life until his death.

<HEAD>Mandela Says White South Africa Has Elected Last Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela told Swedish lawmakers
Tuesday that South African whites have elected their last apartheid
government.
   The black leader, on an international crusade for his
anti-apartheid organization, also appealed for ``massive amounts''
of foreign aid to bolster his group.
   Asked earlier if he thought the next South African president
would be black, Mandela said: ``That is a possibility, but we must
leave that to the future.''
   Speaking to the Swedish parliament, Mandela said there is not a
climate yet in South Africa for black-white power sharing, but a
negotiated settlement to the conflict is not far off.
   ``The road we still have to traverse will not be long,'' Mandela
said. ``It may not be smooth and easy, but clearly the racist
tyranny is on its way out.''
   ``White South Africa has elected its last racial parliament and
its last apartheid president,'' said Mandela, deputy president of
the African National Congress. He was freed last month after more
than 27 years in South African jails.
   Mandela was in Sweden to visit African National Congress
president Oliver Tambo, who is being treated for a stroke he
suffered late last year. He arrived Monday and was expected to stay
five days.
   Mandela told the Swedish legislators that the possibility of a
negotiated settlement in South Africa depends on the government of
President F.W. de Klerk.
   ``As yet, it has not even completed the process of creating a
climate conducive to negotiations,'' he said. ``We shall be meeting
President F.W. de Klerk and his colleagues to address this issue as
soon as the necessary arrangements have been completed.''
   Mandela's ANC has demanded the government free all political
prisoners, remove soldiers from black townships and lift the state
of emergency before talks begin.
   ``We have a vision of South Africa as a united, democratic,
non-sexist, non-racial country,'' Mandela said. ``We see ourselves
as not aligned to any military blocs.''
   Mandela said the international community should provide more aid
to the ANC and tighten sanctions against South Africa.
   He stopped short of a direct rebuke to British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, whose Conservative government became the first
to ease economic sanctions following conciliatory steps by de
Klerk. Mandela said it was up to ANC leaders to decide whether he
should meet Mrs. Thatcher, who has invited him to visit Britain.
   ``We expect all countries to intensify sanctions against South
Africa,'' Mandela said.
   He said countries should also cut diplomatic ties with South
Africa.
   Mandela is scheduled to meet in Stockholm on Thursday with Neil
Kinnock, leader of the British opposition Labor Party, which
supports anti-apartheid sanctions.
   In a two-hour meeting with Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson on Tuesday, Mandela said he reported on the need for
``massive amounts of assistance'' from Sweden and the international
community.
   Carlsson said Swedish aid to the ANC would continue. Sweden has
allocated $45 million to the ANC this year.
   Since being freed from jail, Mandela has kept an exhausting
schedule. His current trip has also taken him to Tanzania, Zambia,
Zimbabwe and Ethiopia for public rallies and conferences with
government and African leaders.

Drunk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An expert defense witness testified
Tuesday that a delay in a blood-alcohol test made it virtually
impossible to determine whether Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph
Hazelwood was drunk when his tanker ran aground.
   The test wasn't performed until 10{ hours after the 987-foot
tanker ran aground March 24 in Prince William Sound, spilling
nearly 11 million gallons in the nation's worst oil spill.
   The prosecution contends that Hazelwood was drunk.
   Michael Hlastala, a physiology professor at the University of
Washington in Seattle, rebutted a prosecution expert's claim that
he could tell Hazelwood was drunk when his ship ran aground by
doing calculations based on the blood test.
   ``Once you are beyond a few hours, it's impossible to make any
sense of an extrapolation,'' Hlastala testified in Hazelwood's
Superior Court trial.
   The professor said he was familiar with the technique of
retrograde extrapolation, which seeks to establish blood alcohol
levels at a time distant from when blood tests are taken.
   He said there would be numerous variables in Hazelwood's case,
such as the rate at which the body absorbs and eliminates alcohol
and the times the captain started and stopped drinking. Testimony
hasn't established conclusive numbers for any of the variables.
   Hlastala showed jurors a graph in which he calculated a wide
range of possible blood-alcohol levels that could be deduced from
the test. They ranged from .10, the Alaska standard for drunken
driving, to .50, where the expert said a person would be near death.
   He said the calculations are further complicated because, to
reach these levels, a person would have to consume 7.7 standard
drinks, which he defined as one-ounce shots of 80-proof liquor. No
one has alleged Hazelwood drank that much.
   Hlastala said his calculations proved only one thing: ``It's
virtually impossible to go back and get meaningful information
about blood-alcohol levels.''
   Earlier, Judge Karl Johnston cleared the way for the prosecution
to suggest Hazelwood was a heavy drinker and was able to hide the
effects of alcohol, despite objections from the defense.
   Johnstone said he felt the prosecution had the right ``to
explore all the possibilities of blood alcohol and its effect on
the defendant.''
   In remarks to Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole, Johnstone
warned, ``It's thin line that you're walking here,'' and added that
he wasn't yet giving permission for Cole to present such a theory
in final arguments.
   Under cross-examination by Cole, defense expert Thomas Burr said
experienced drinkers were better able to hide the effects of
alcohol, but added the person would have to be used to drinking
routinely to become adept at it.
   ``Some people do it better than others?'' asked Cole.
   ``Yes,'' said the witness, an alcohol and drug testing
consultant from Minneapolis.
   Cole asked whether an intoxicated person who didn't want others
to observe his drunken state might go somewhere nobody could see
him.
   ``I guess so,'' the witness said with a laugh.
   ``Like go below?'' Cole asked, referring to the captain's
quarters on the Exxon Valdez.
   The answer was blocked by a defense objection.
   According to earlier testimony, Hazelwood left the bridge in
command of his third mate and went to his cabin before the tanker
ran aground.
   Burr also disputed the validity of calculating the amount of
blood in Hazelwood's system by calculating backwards.
   ``If there was any alcohol consumption during this period of
time, there's absolutely no validity ... no validity whatsoever,''
Burr said.
   There have been suggestions during the lengthy trial that
Hazelwood drank some low-alcohol beer in his cabin after the
grounding.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., was the only crew member of
the Exxon Valdez charged criminally in the accident. He is accused
of criminal mischief, reckless endangerment, operating a vessel
while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil. If convicted, he
faces a maximum penalty of 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   On questioning by defense attorney Dick Madson, Burr said a
person showing no visible signs of intoxication was unlikely to
have a blood-alcohol reading as high as the one calculated for
Hazelwood by the prosecution expert.
   Burr added he never has seen anyone with a blood alcohol level
of 0.15 who did not show some signs of intoxication.
   Burr's expertise in the field was challenged by Cole, who noted
the witness had no advanced degrees and is not a toxicologist.
   Burr said his 22 years in the St. Paul, Minn., police crime
laboratory gave him ample knowledge.

<HEAD>Memo From DOE Inadvertently Disclosed: Lists Rash of Reactor
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDAN RILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy on Tuesday
defended an inadvertently leaked memo about nuclear contamination
problems at weapons plants nationwide as proof it is keeping on top
of operations.
   ``It indicates we're taking the trouble to find out what's going
on and fixing it,'' said DOE press secretary Mary Joy Jameson.
   The memo, a briefing paper for DOE Secretary James Watkins, was
mistakenly sent by fax machine to governors around the country on
Monday. The Associated Press obtained a copy.
   Three hours after the briefing paper was sent out, a note
addressed to ``all state governors'' urged them to disregard and
destroy the document. It wasn't known how many governors' offices
had received it.
   The two-page summary described various problems at the
government's nuclear complex, including ``widespread low-level
contamination'' at a tank farm at the Savannah River Site in South
Carolina; the discovery of three live wires at Savannah River that
posed ``imminent danger'' and an effort to halt the activities of
anti-nuclear protesters.
   The document originally said the low-level contamination leak
was at a tank farm in Hanford, Wash., but the DOE corrected it
Tuesday to Savannah River.
   Ms. Jameson said she knew of no actual danger to workers or
other people as a result of any of the incidents. ``If there was
any danger, we would have issued a press release,'' she said.
   Tom Clements, southeast nuclear campaigner for Greenpeace, said
he was ``shocked but not surprised'' by the memo. ``This just
reflects that the Department of Energy has a lot more to hide than
has been revealed, and I would call on them to release information
about all the problems and all the contamination that they have not
released to this date,'' Clements said.
   Among other things, the document said a radiation survey in the
control room of a reactor at Oak Ridge, Tenn., found that four
chairs and a stool were contaminated with cobalt-60. Two chairs
were disposed of and the other furniture was decontaminated.
   Another item in the document said a cleanup of last week's
``widespread low-level contamination'' in the tank farm at Savannah
River was continuing. The efforts included cleaning all paved roads
and a radioactivity survey.
   Ms. Jameson said there was a recent spill of contaminated water
in the tank farm but ``it wasn't hazardous to the health of anyone.
It could have been if it had not been detected and cleaned up.''
   At Hanford, the memo said a fire in a weapons cleaning trailer
Friday had destroyed the trailer, but no injuries were reported.
   Other reports in the briefing paper:
   _ Sandia National Laboratories management and the DOE's
Albuquerque, N.M., office agreed to suspend operation Friday of a
particle beam fusion accelerator after ``numerous safety concerns''
were identified.
   _ An annual safeguards and security survey at Sandia showed a
shortage of classified parts at a microelectronics operation. The
memo said the problem had been reported in January and that a
complete inventory would be conducted.
   _ A Sandia subcontractor being escorted into the laboratory was
denied access when guards using sniffer dogs found six live rounds
of handgun ammunition and traces of marijuana in the person's
vehicle. The subcontractor's badge was pulled and the employer
notified.
   _ The DOE's Savannah River operations office said the
Westinghouse Savannah River Co. had discovered that seismic support
U-bolts were missing from some supplementary safety system
injection lines on a reactor.
   _ Also at Savannah River, DOE and OSHA inspectors found three
live, bare wires in a reactor building. The wires were fixed and an
investigation is being conducted into what was described as an
``imminent danger,'' Watkins was advised. The memo contained no
other details.
   _ A DOE truck convoy was followed and photographed in Texas and
Oklahoma on Thursday by anti-nuclear protesters in two cars. The
note indicates that authorities looked into the police records of
the cars' owners but found no outstanding warrants.
   _ A security inspector at the DOE's Rocky Flats, Colo., weapons
plant was arrested Sunday in Aurora, Colo., on suspicion of
burglary, assault and rape. The employee was suspended.
   The memo was signed by Stephen Ronshaugen in the office of the
DOE undersecretary.
   Sandia spokesman Nigel Hey said the Sandia problems cited in the
document were housekeeping matters and had nothing to do with
scientific or engineering aspects of the accelerator.
   Officials with both the Savannah River Site near Aiken, S.C.,
and the plant's operator, Westinghouse Savannah River Co., referred
questions about the memo to the DOE in Washington.

<HEAD>Six-Month British Ambulance Dispute Is Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A six-month pay dispute that crippled British
ambulance services ended Tuesday when the 22,500-member workforce
accepted a new government offer.
   The dispute began Sept. 7, when ambulance crews started refusing
to work overtime. It worsened within a month when they stopped
using their radios and many crews walked out on strike.
   Army and police vehicles, taxis and Red Cross volunteers were
organized to take emergency cases to hospitals.
   The five unions involved said Tuesday their members favored the
offer by a vote of 81 percent to 19 percent.
   The government proposal increases the annual pay of a qualified
ambulance worker by 17.6 percent, from $16,148 to $18,992. The
government runs the National Health Service.
   Roger Poole, the unions' chief negotiator, said service would be
back to normal by Friday.
   ``Our members have won a substantial improvement on the
government's 6.5 percent original offer, and this success
vindicates their industrial campaign,'' he said.
   The health department stressed that it had not given in to the
unions' demand for a formula guaranteeing future raises.
   ``The public owe a great debt of gratitude to the voluntary
services, police and armed forces who helped to maintain accident
and emergency services in many parts of the country,'' said Health
Secretary Kenneth Clarke.
   During the dispute, ambulance crews refusing to work normally
were suspended without pay. But the crews are popular and widely
recognized as low paid, and the public rallied behind them by
contributing money and signatures to a petition signed by four
million people.

   Bruno Bettelheim, a psychologist and prolific
author who studied under Sigmund Freud and gained fame for his work
with emotionally disturbed children, killed himself Tuesday in a
Maryland nursing home, a medical examiner said. He was 86.
   Maryland's chief medical examiner, Dr. John E. Smialek, said
Tuesday night that one of his deputies who examined Bettelheim had
determined the cause of death was suicidal asphyxiation.
   Smialek declined to give details.
   Bettelman lived at The Charter House nursing home in Silver
Spring, Md. A secretary who did not give her name referred calls
Tuesday night to Bettelheim's family, but declined to provide a
telephone number.
   Bettelheim, who was also known for his Freudian interpretations
of fairy tales, ran The Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School for
disturbed children at the University of Chicago from 1944 to 1973,
and was a professor of psychology and psychiatry at the university.
   ``He was like such men, great men, a whole combination of
things. He could be extraordinarly charming, but very authoritarian
so that one could easily tremble at the sight of him,'' said
Jacquelyn Sanders, who took over the school in 1973. ``He also was
fascinating, very cultured.''
   Perhaps his most famous book, ``Love is Not Enough,'' related
the ideas he practiced at the school. He advocated giving disturbed
children round-the-clock attention from professionals instead of
leaving them to a caretaker staff after a few hours of therapy,
said Benjamin Wright, a professor of education and psychology at
the university.
   Bettelheim was at the school from early morning to after
midnight nearly every day, said Wright, who worked at the school
from 1950 to 1957.
   ``It was a miracle of devotion to the cause of providing a
better life for these childen. He was superhumanly devoted to it,''
Wright said. ``I think that his greatest moment were those years at
the school.''
   Dr. Raymond Fowler, chief executive officer of the American
Psychological Association in Washington, said ``Love is Not
Enough'' influenced his decision to become a psychologist.
   ``He was an incredibly articulate person,'' Fowler said. ``Much
of his impact was simply because of his writings because he wrote
so brilliantly.''
   Bettelheim was born Aug. 28, 1903, in Vienna, Austria. He was
educated in Vienna, where he studied under Freud, the famous
psychoanalyst.
   In 1938, the Nazis arrested Bettelheim, a Jew, and sent him to
the Dachau and Buchenwald concentration camps. He was released in
1939 and came to the United States. He gained early fame for his
study of death camp prisoners.
   He took over the Orthogenic School in 1944, and brought it to
world prominence.
   ``To me his most significant work was at the Orthogenic School,
where he created a kind of environment for kids, for very complete
failures,'' Sanders said.
   Wright said the school's success stories included several
college professors, two successful authors and a stockbroker.
   Many schools have been formed on the principles Bettelheim used
at the Orthogenic School, but none have duplicated his success
because no one has been willing to put in the time he did, Wright
said.
   Bettelheim became professor emeritus at the University of
Chicago in 1975, but continued to write.
   Rudolf Ekstein, a longtime colleague and friend, spent weekends
with Bettelheim after he moved to California during his retirement
years.
   ``In a way it was my good luck that he spent the last couple of
years herem, so we would come together on weekends to discuss not
only treatment of children but the way the world turns, you know
Russia and Eastern Europe, because we were both refugees,'' Ekstein
said in a telephone interview.
   In addition to ``Love is Not Enough,'' which was published in
1950, Bettelheim's workds included ``Dynamics of Prejudice''
(1950), ``Truants from Life'' (1955), ``The Informed Heart''
(1960), ``The Children of the Dream'' (1969) and ``The Uses of
Enchantment (1976), with Karen Zelan.

   Millionaire oilman-rancher Clayton Williams
jumped to a wide lead in early returns from the Republican
gubernatorial primary Tuesday. State Treasurer Ann Richards led in
a battle among three mud-slinging Democrats that appeared likely to
end in a runoff.
   With 1 percent of precincts counted, Williams, a political
newcomer who spend $8 million on the race, led a seven-way GOP
field with 57,511 votes or 63 percent. Railroad Commissioner Kent
Hance, a former Democratic congressman, was a distant second with
12,363 votes or 14 percent, followed by Tom Luce, a lawyer for
billionaire H. Ross Perot, with 10,151 votes or 11 percent. Former
Secretary of State Jack Rains of Houston was fourth with 9,214
votes or 10 percent.
   On the Democratic side, Richards led with 42,615 votes or 42
percent, followed by Attorney General Jim Mattox, with 31,097 votes
or 31 percent, and former Gov. Mark White, with 24,358 votes or 24
percent. Four other candidates divided the remaining vote.
   Richards, who dodged repeated questions during the campaign
about whether she had ever used illegal drugs, accused Mattox and
White of profiteering from public service. She was bidding for a
chance to become the state's first woman governor since Miriam
``Ma'' Ferguson left the office in 1935.
   White and Mattox called Ms. Richards a liar, and the bitterness
appeared likely to continue until April 10. If none of the three
polled more than 50 percent of the vote, the top two would meet
then in a runoff.
   Williams, who calls himself ``just a country boy'' and admits to
occasional fistfights, spent $6 million from his own pockets in the
campaign.
   A confident Williams, wearing cowboy boots, voted at Saddle Club
South Clubhouse near his Midland home. ``There's a good chance we
can win without a runoff,'' Williams said.
   He said earlier that if that happened and the opposition was
forced into a runoff, he would relax and ``have some fun watching
each of the Democrats murdering on each other.''
   Election officials reported brisk turnout throughout the day
around the state. The secretary of state's office predicted a
turnout of 2.1 million to 2.6 million of the 8.3 million eligible
voters, who can vote for either party.
   Absentee balloting was expected to account for up to 25 percent
of the vote. It was the first gubernatorial race in Texas since the
state allowed people to vote absentee without stating a reason.
   Also on the GOP ballot were Ed Cude of Houston; W.N. Otwell, a
Fort Worth preacher, and Royce X. Owens, an elementary school
custodian from Merkel.
   Other Democrats running were: Stanley Adams of Austin, a former
executive with a failed savings and loan; Theresa Hearn-Haynes of
Spring, who described her occupation as doctor of law; Hawkins
retiree Earl Holmes, and Ray Rachal of Stafford.
   Texans also voted on the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican
Phil Gramm, who has no GOP opponent in his bid for a second term.
State Sen. Hugh Parmer, a 50-year-old Fort Worth lawyer, sought the
Democratic nomination and was piling up a better than 3-1 margin
against his only opponent, Harley Schlanger, a Houston follower of
extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   Jim Hightower, the state agriculture commissioner who raised
controversy at every turn, was pulling in 69 percent of the vote in
early returns as he defended himself against six Democratic
opponents supported by the Texas Farm Bureau.
   Hightower bills himself a friend of the small, independent
farmer, but brought the wrath of some ranchers with his support of
hormone-free beef. Republicans last year failed in their bid to
have the Legislature abolish Hightower's job.
   Three Republicans also were competing for it in the primary.

   Spending in the gubernatorial races topped $25 million, a state
record.
   Ms. Richards won prominence as the keynote speaker at the 1988
Democratic National Convention, where she said President Bush was
born ``with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   She saw an early lead in polls slip amid charges of racism and
for her refusal to say ``yes or no'' when asked during three
televised debates whether she'd ever abused drugs. A recovering
alcoholic, she said her ``addiction was alcohol'' and she didn't
want to discourage others from seeking treatment.
   Her opponents said they never used illegal substances and called
on Ms. Richards to answer. Mattox warned that the Republicans would
``bust our party'' if she wouldn't answer as the Democratic nominee.
   Ms. Richards, in turn, asked how White could ``move from a
government salary to a $1.3 million mansion in Houston right after
leaving the governor's office?'' Mattox, she charged, took campaign
contributions from people doing business with the state.
   White called her charges ``a pack of lies.'' Mattox said her
attacks had ``become rather scurrilous.''
   Williams attracted some criticism early in the campaign when
opponents said he'd been in two fistfights during the past eight
years. But he said both fights were justified, and turned the
criticism to his advantage by saying Texans would prefer a governor
who fights for what's right.
   Republicans are especially determined to hold onto the
governorship this year because of reapportionment, in which Texas
is expected to gain three or four Congressional seats based on the
1990 census.
   The Legislature _ almost certain to remain in Democratic control
_ will draw the new lines, but a GOP governor could veto the plan.
   The current governor, Republican Bill Clements, is retiring.

   President Bush lifted trade sanctions against
Nicaragua on Tuesday and asked Congress to swiftly approve a $300
million down payment for rebuilding the nation's ravaged economy
and speeding a transition to democracy. He said the money would
come from the Pentagon.
   Rushing to shore up the incoming government of President-elect
Violeta Chamorro, Bush also pledged to seek an additional $200
million in fiscal 1991 which begins Oct. 1.
   Bush coupled the request for Nicaragua with a challenge to
Congress to approve a stalled aid package of $500 million for
Panama, where the United States installed a new government after
deposing Manuel Antonio Noriega last December. Bush also is seeking
$70 million in refugee assistance in Panama.
   The president urged Congress to complete work by April 5 on
money for both countries. All the funds would be diverted from the
Pentagon's budget, perhaps the first real ``peace dividend'' from
the receding Cold War.
   ``These nations need our help to heal deep wounds inflicted by
years of strife and oppression, years of loss and deprivation,''
Bush said. ``And we must act and act soon.'''
   Congress appeared receptive.
   Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., a member of the House leadership and
among the foremost foes of past U.S. policy in Nicaragua, predicted
Congress would approve the aid before recessing next month for
Easter.
   ``For years we've been hearing speeches about what America could
do if only Noriega and Ortega were gone,'' said Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., referring to the former Panamanian ruler
and to Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega who lost the election to
Mrs. Chamorro last month.
   ``Well, Ortega and Noriega are history. It's time for Congress
to deliver,'' Dole said.
   Senate Appropriations Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., promised
quick consideration of Bush's request but pointed out that Congress
is still in dispute over the president's ability to channel
Pentagon funds into the package.
   Byrd, in a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
noted that the General Accounting Office has contested the
administration's authority to delay spending $2.2 billion in
defense funds that had been approved by Congress.
   Bush announced his requests in a 41-minute news conference,
during which he also fielded questions on topics ranging from the
budget and foreign policy to baseball's labor dispute that
threatens to delay the season's opener.
   He made these points:
   _He does not support a tax increase or a freeze in Social
Security benefits as proposed in a deficit-reduction package
offered by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. Nevertheless, Bush said he
did not want to appear inflexible and was willing to negotiate with
the Democrats.
   _He is ``not happy with the status quo'' in China, where a
crackdown remains in force against advocates of democracy. Even so,
Bush said he had no regrets about U.S. policy toward Beijing.
   _It would be ``very inappropriate'' for him to comment on the
Soviet parliament's approval of a new powers for President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev. ``I think we have a reasonably good relationship
there, a respectful one and I'm going to continue to work with
him,'' he said.
   _There is ``no bubbling war'' with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan despite differences over interest rates. ``Look, every
president would like to see interest rates lower,'' Bush said.
   _He did not regret getting involved in a telephone call with a
person he believed to be Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani but
who turned out to be an impostor. ``What's wrong with reaching out
and touching someone when the hostages are at stake?'' he said.
   He said a long-ago use of marijuana shouldn't disqualify a
political candidate. The question arose in the context of a
political flap in Texas where Ann Richards, who is seeking the
Democratic gubernatorial nomination, has refused to say whether she
ever used illegal drugs.
   Opening his news conference, Bush announced he had lifted the
five-year-old economic embargo against Nicaragua, one of the tools
used by the United States to undermine the leftist government of
Ortega.
   The president also took steps to allow Nicaragua to resume
shipping sugar to the United States and to make that nation
eligible for duty-free treatment for a variety of other products.
   While acknowledging some concern about the reluctance of the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels to demobilize in Nicaragua, Bush said,
``I'm less concerned than I was about the peaceful transfer of
power, including the military.''
   Money for Panama and Nicaragua will be drawn from money allotted
to the Pentagon, requiring a decision on which defense programs
will be cut. Bush said that if Congress can't make up its mind
about cutbacks by March 27, it should let him do the job himself.
   Of the money for Nicaragua, $75 million would be earmarked for
economic restructuring, $60 million for critical agricultural
supplies, petroleum and medical supplies, another $60 million for
development projects and $50 million to help with foreign debts.
   Some $10 million would help pay for ``emergency employment
programs,'' including ones designed to help turn soldiers into
farmers. In addition, $45 million would go toward helping speed the
repatriation and resettlement of the U.S.-backed Contra forces and
other refugees.
   The Nicaraguan Embassy issued a statement in the name of Mrs.
Lenor A. Huper, charge d'affaires, saying ``we express our support
for both' the end of sanctions and the aid package, and inviting
U.S. experts to inspect Nicaragua's economic situation at first
hand.
   On another subject at his news conference, Bush was asked about
the baseball dispute and the decision by owners to lock players out
of spring training camps.
   He said he didn't want to have the federal government intervene
but instead ``would simply appeal to both sides to get the matter
resolved so the American people can hear that cry, `Play ball,'
again.''
   He refused to retract his description of East Jerusalem as
occupied territory _ a statement that has caused a political uproar
in Israel.
   ``I don't regret it,'' Bush said, adding that he was merely
reiterating U.S. policy. He said his statement had been blown out
of proportion and said that further comment would not be helpful.
   Asked if the administration would recognize a drive for
independence by the Soviet Republic of Lithuania, Bush said, ``We
want to see the evolution of the control of the territory there.''
He said the U.S. government might not use the words ``captive
nations'' to describe Lithuania and other Baltic states, as it has
in the past.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
pledged at her inauguration Tuesday ``to clean the face of Haiti''
with a provisional civilian government that will lead this country
to its first free elections.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillo, who took a leave of absence as Supreme
Court justice, is the first female president in the 186-year
history of this impoverished Caribbean island nation.
   She was sworn in a day after military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril fled following a week of violent demonstrations against his
18-month regime that left at least 24 dead in Haiti. Late Tuesday,
radio stations reported the deaths of six people in a coastal
village following a land dispute.
   ``I have accepted this heavy task in the name of Haitian
women,'' she told hundreds of political and civic leaders,
diplomats and army officers at the National Palace ceremony. ``My
government will be what you want it to be.''
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, 46, will govern along with a 19-member
advisory council until elections are held, possibly in three to six
months.
   ``In the short time I have, I will work to clean the face of
Haiti,'' she promised.
   She spoke in both French and Creole, the island patois.
   ``Mrs. President of the Republic, the armed forces of Haiti are
at your command,'' said Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, who led a
caretaker government for 72 hours after Avril resigned Saturday.
``The army is returning and staying in the barracks.''
   The audience wildly cheered Abraham's words.
   After the ceremony, thousands of Haitians outside the domed,
white-stone palace filled Champ de Mars Plaza and cheered when she
came outside.
   A strike and fear had left this capital of 1 million people
deserted for days.
   Businesses reopened Tuesday and Port-au-Prince was calm, except
for northern Delmas sector, where gunfire sent hundreds fleeing
indoors in the early morning. It was not clear who did the shooting.
   An hour after the ceremony, mobs stormed the two-story suburban
home of a prominent land owner. They stole furniture, destroyed
belongings and shattered windows.
   ``There were hundreds of them, they came and destroyed
everything,'' said Candelon Lucas, who was a deputy in the National
Assembly from 1957-80, through most of the 29-year Duvalier dynasty
dictatorship.
   Six people meanwhile were killed in Deluge, a village 37 miles
north of Port-au-Prince, according to Roman Catholic Radio Soleil
and Haiti-Inter, a private TV station. They said the deaths
occurred when sheriffs tried to evict peasants squatting on the
property of an absentee landowner.
   The reports said four peasants, a sheriff and his deputy were
killed. In addition, 400 huts were reportedly burned, leaving 2,000
people homeless.
   After Avril flew into exile Monday on a U.S. Air Force jet, the
Bush administration urged ``all Haitians (to) work together in a
spirit of reconciliation'' to achieve free elections and respect
for human rights ``as rapidly as possible.''
   Unity Assembly, an opposition coalition comprising 11 political
parties and one civic organization, chose Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot as
interim president on Monday.
   The coalition was instrumental in leading nationwide protests
against Avril, who came to power in a soldiers' coup in September
1988.
   Since a slaves' revolt ended French rule here in 1804,
establishing Haiti as the first independent republic in Latin
America, most of Haiti's 38 presidents have been military.
   The new president will lead the first government controlled by
civilians since Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier fled to exile in
France in February 1986. His departure ended the 29-year
dictatorship begun by his father, the late Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier.
   Haiti's last civilian president, Leslie Manigat, came to power
in January 1988 in elections widely regarded as fraudulent. But the
army controlled his administration, and he was eventually toppled
by Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in June 1988. Namphy was ousted three
months later in the coup that brought Avril to power.
   ``This government is the product of the unanimous will of all
political parties and social sectors,'' Rene Theodore, leader of
the Communist Party and a major player in the military transition
of power, said of the new government.
   Abraham, the major general, agreed Monday to accept Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot as provisional president. The opposition refused
the army choice of Supreme Court President Gilbert Austin, an Avril
appointee.
   The State Council that will help Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot govern is
comprised of civic, church, labor and rights groups, as well as one
army member appointed by the opposition until elections are held.
The council will approve the president's Cabinet and reportedly
will have veto power over her decisions.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said she would ``hold the reins during the
electoral period until the installment of a definitive government
that the people will choose in complete freedom.''
   Members of the State Council include Dr. Louis Roy, main author
of the 1987 constitution, who returned Monday from exile in
Montreal. Avril sent him there in a harsh crackdown against the
opposition in January.
   ``Even if the Haitian people haven't decided exactly where they
want to go, they have clearly said what they no longer want:
dictatorship,'' Roy said.
   Coalition co-leader Victor Benoit said the group chose Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot because other justices declined. He said the Army
High Command ``has promised us that the Presidential Guard will be
kept under control.''
   ``But there are still Duvalierist death squads who oppose
change. They're armed, and we know they're very angry about this
change,'' he said.
   Avril commanded the loyalty of much of the 1,100 Presidential
Guard throughout last week's unrest.

   The United States is considering sale of a new
air defense missile to Israel, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said
Tuesday.
   Answering questions after a speech at a youth conference of the
United Jewish Appeal, Cheney said sale of the Patriot missile
system was ``under discussion.''
   The Patriot is a 17-foot long missile used by the U.S. Army to
defend ground units. It has been deployed with troops in Europe.
   The missile, made by Raytheon Corp., is designed to replace an
earlier air defense missile, the Hawk. Hawks have been supplied to
Israel for years.
   Cheney gave no details of the discussion, such as how many
missiles might be supplied or how they would be paid for.

agreeing to allow Poland to participate in unification talks, EDITS

<TEXT>
   West Germany said Tuesday that it will
allow Poland to participate in international talks on German
unification so that it can argue the issue of maintaining its
current border with East Germany.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said meanwhile that East Germans with
moderate savings will be able to exchange their money for West
German marks on a one-to-one basis, according to media reports.
   A Foreign Ministry statement issued in Bonn indicated France and
West Germany had settled their differences over giving Poland a
place in unification discussions. The talks begin Wednesday between
the two German states and the World War II victors _ the United
States, Soviet Union, France and Britain.
   The Foreign Ministry statement said France and West Germany
agreed that Poland should participate ``when the question of
Poland's western border is discussed.''
   France backed Poland's demand to be included. West Germany had
said the concerns of all interested nations would be addressed, but
had resisted widening the so-called ``two-plus-four'' six-nation
talks.
   It was not clear, however, whether Poland would actually have a
seat at the discussions or be consulted in some other way when the
border question arises.
   Poland has demanded a role to protect its border with East
Germany formed by the Oder and Neisse rivers. About one-third of
present-day western Poland belonged to Germany before World War II.
   French President Francois Mitterrand declared after meeting
Polish leaders Friday that unification could not go forward unless
both Germany signed binding accords recognizing the border and its
inviolability.
   It was a rebuke of Kohl, who had stopped short of making a firm
recognition of the border, stating that only a unified Germany
could do so.
   Mitterrand termed ``insufficient'' a declaration passed by the
West German parliament Thursday that promised to respect the border
but failed to mention the Oder-Neisse line.
   The leader of Kohl's Conservative Party acknowledged Tuesday
that international concerns are slowing German unification, and
said the process could take three years to complete.
   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union, said unification cannot be completed ``as long as the
external questions ... are not settled.''
   He was referring to how German unification will affect the
European balance of power and other nations' security.
   Kohl has come under intense international scrutiny for trying to
push unification at a pace that has worried the Soviets, as well as
some of West Germany's friends and neighbors.
   But Kohl's handling of unification has worried European nations
that their security interests could be overlooked during the
process, and the Soviets have made it clear they think Kohl is
being too hasty.
   One of the most complex unification issues facing the German
states is how to protect the estimated $10 billion in East German
savings once the German economies are joined.
   ``Federal Chancellor Kohl said this evening at a campaign
gathering in Cottbus that moderate savers in East Germany will get
a one-to-one exchange rate,'' the ZDF television network said,
without elaborating.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann made similar
comments at an international trade fair in Leipzig.
   The report came as a German commission met in East Berlin to
hammer out recommendations for forming a monetary union. Horst
Koehler, a state secretary in West Germany's Finance Ministry, and
finance expert Walter Romberg, a minister in the caretaker
government of Communist Premier Hans Modrow, led the meeting.
   The two sides have met twice before, in Bonn and East Berlin, to
discuss forming a monetary union. But no decisions on unification
are expected until after the East German elections on Sunday.
   A statement issued after the monetary talks gave no indication
of whether the commission reached agreement. ``An economic union
can be completed quickly with the corresponding will of the
partners,'' the statement said.
   The current official exchange rate is three East marks for one
West mark for tourists and visitors, but one-to-one for commercial
transactions.
   The East German State Bank has called for a parity exchange
rate. There are concerns, however, that if West Germany were to buy
up savings at a one-to-one rate, the huge increase in money supply
would increase inflation.
   In Frankfurt, the West German central bank said that starting
Wednesday, East Germans could freely deposit and withdraw deposits
in West German marks from their bank accounts in both East and West.
   East Germans had been limited to withdrawing not more than 5,000
West German marks at a time in the West, and 300 West German marks
per month in East Germany, said East Germany's official ADN news
agency.

   The government on Tuesday fired Boyan
Traikov from his longtime job as director general of the state news
agency BTA and also dismissed his deputy, Nencho Hranov.
   It named Georgi Todorov, 56, a veteran foreign correspondent and
editor-in-chief of BTA's international news department, to succeed
Traikov.
   Traikov was a trusted ally of Todor Zhivkov, ousted as Communist
Party chief last November, and up to last year was also a member of
the party's policy-making Central Committee.
   The official announcement said Traikov was relieved ``due to
another appointment.''
   However, knowledgeable sources in Sofia _ speaking on the
condition of anonymity _ had long predicted his departure and said
BTA editors had grown angry and restless over government failure to
replace Traikov and Hranov.
   Zhivkov left during a wave of popular protest that led to
pledges of reform from the Communist leadership.

   Here are major elements of President Bush's
aid package for Nicaragua and Panama.
   OVERALL FUNDS: Bush coupled a $300 million aid package to help
Nicaragua speed the transition to democracy with a renewed request
for $500 million in aid to Panama. He requested the Panama money
earlier this year, but it got sidetracked in Congress on other
issues.
   The Nicaragua and Panama money would be diverted from
unspecified Pentagon programs. An existing $21 million would be
used for emergency aid to Nicaragua, including food. Some of it
would be used to help re-integrate the Contra rebels.

   TRADE: The president lifted a five-year-old trade embargo

   SUPPLIES: Some $60 million would be earmarked for providing
critical agricultural supplies, petroleum and medical supplies.
   EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS: $10 million would help pay for ``emergency
employment programs,'' including ones designed to help turn
soldiers into farmers.
   RESETTLEMENT: Some $45 million would go toward helping speed the
repatriation and resettlement of the U.S.-backed Contra forces and
other refugees, and an additional $1 million would be used for
technical assistance in restructuring the economy.
   INTERNATIONAL FINANCE: Some $50 million would be used to help
Nicaragua pay off debt to the International Monetary Fund and other
international financial institutions. An additional $75 million
would go toward helping to prop up the Nicaraguan currency to help
restructure the economy and aid the country with its
balance-of-payments imbalance.
   PROJECTS: About $60 million would help pay for such projects as
bridge, road and highway repair and refurbishing schools and
hospitals.
   FURTHER AID: Bush said he would later propose an additional $200
million to be used in the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, with
details to be announced later.

<HEAD>Indian Troops Withdraw from Trincomalee Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indian troops pulled out of an eastern
town Tuesday under a withdrawal that is scheduled to be completed
by the end of this month, officials said.
   ``The troops have moved out of Trincomalee town to China Bay,''
5{ miles away, an Indian High Commission, or embassy, official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not say
how many troops were stationed in Trincomalee, 150 miles northeast
of Colombo, before the withdrawal and gave no other details.
   China Bay, a Sri Lankan naval base with a deep-water port, is
one of the three points being used by Indian troops to leave Sri
Lanka.
   Sri Lankan military officials in Colombo said Trincomalee had
been taken over by guerrillas of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, the largest rebel group that fought the Indian troops for
more than two years.
   Indian troops were stationed in Sri Lanka's northern and eastern
districts to enforce a July 1987 accord that aimed to end a Tamil
separatist campaign by giving the ethnic minority limited autonomy.
The soldiers were supposed to supervise an arms surrender by the
dozens of Tamil militant groups.
   But the Tamil Tigers, after an initial acceptance, resumed the
guerrilla war and the accord collapsed. India sent more soldiers to
put down the rebellion and at one point more than 70,000 troops
were deployed in the northeast.
   The Tamil Tigers started their own peace talks with the Sri
Lankan government in May 1989, and a month later President
Ranasinghe Premadasa asked India to withdraw all troops by July 27,
1989, the second anniversary of the India-Sri Lanka accord.
   After bitter disagreements and a prolonged diplomatic deadlock,
the two countries agreed in January on the latest pullout deadline
of March 31.
   The withdrawal had sparked fears of fighting between the Tamil
Tigers and a former rebel group, the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front, which gave up arms in 1987 to join mainstream
politics. The front was elected to head the Northeastern Provincial
Council in November 1988.
   A prominent Tiger leader, Stanley Dominic, said Tuesday there
will be no factional fighting.
   ``The Indians have taken their boot-lickers, the EPRLF, with
them. So we do not have to fight them,'' Dominic, commander of the
northern Jaffna area, said in an interview in the town.
   There have been reports that EPRLF members were fleeing to India
fearing reprisal killings by the Tamil Tigers.
   Vartharajah Perumal, the Northeastern Provincial Council chief
minister, also was reported to have fled to India on Sunday.
Trincomalee residents said Perumal and his family left aboard an
Indian air force plane.
   Residents in Jaffna said Indian troops were leaving every day.
   Indian officials have refused to say how many troops remain in
Sri Lanka.
   Tamil militants began fighting for a separate homeland in 1983,
alleging discrimination by the majority Sinhalese in jobs,
education and the use of Sinhala language.
   About 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people are Tamils,
most of whom live in the northern and eastern regions. Sinhalese
make up 75 percent of the population.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the Tamil rebellion.
   Also, at least 6,000 more people have been killed in a left-wing
Sinhalese extremist campaign. The movement, which centered in the
southern and central districts, was launched in 1987 to protest the
peace accord and the presence of Indian troops in Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
   A sniper opened fire Tuesday on a moving Greyhound bus in
Chicago, marking the seventh bus-shooting incident nationwide since
drivers went on strike, officials said. Neither the 13 passengers
nor the driver were injured.
   In Fresno, Calif., a Greyhound-owned Trailways bus parked in a
storage yard was set on fire, police said.
   Someone entered the unlocked bus Monday night and used a road
flare to torch the interior. No injuries were reported, and
authorities did not know if the fire was strike related.
   In another development, Dallas-based Greyhound Lines Inc. said
it would resume taks with union leaders on Saturday in Phoenix at
the request of federal mediators.
   ``There's no point in our speculating what may happen,'' said
Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said. ``We are going back to the
bargaining table and that speaks for itself.''
   Gravley said he did not know if the Phoenix-based union had a
new proposal and was unsure if the company would modify its stance.
   ``We are delighted that the company is returning to the table,''
said union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson. ``We sincerely hope that they
will negotiate in good faith.''
   Greyhound's executive vice president and chief labor negotiator,
P. Anthony Lannie, will still meet in Washington on Wednesday with
Bernard DeLury, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, Gravley said. DeLury met with union officials Monday.
   The strike began March 2 when 6,300 drivers and about 3,000
office and maintenance workers walked off the job in a dispute over
wages and job security.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste's office said Greyhound had agreed to
equip company buses traveling through his state with citizens-band
radios and provide route lists to the State Highway Patrol to help
ensure public safety. Celeste recommended both actions last week.
   In the Chicago shooting, two bullets hit the bus's front end,
one hit the door and one went through a window and ``just missed a
fellow's head by a couple inches,'' said Master Sgt. John Meduga of
the Illinois State Police.
   ``When a shot came through the glass, everybody started to
scream,'' Meduga said.
   Passengers were transferred to another bus bound for Memphis,
Tenn., after the 1:15 a.m. CST shooting, officials said.
   A company official indicated the shooting could be
strike-related, but a union leader said he would never believe one
of his members could be involved.
   Gravley said the shooting was the seventh since the drivers'
strike began. He said he had no evidence to connect the latest
shooting to the strike, but added, ``We don't have buses shot at
when we're not negotiating a contract.''
   William Pearsall, vice president of the Amalgamated Transit
Union's Local 1303, which represents the Chicago area, said he did
not believe the union was involved.
   ``I will never believe any union member that's on strike is
doing this,'' Pearsall said. ``I would turn in anybody I knew who
was shooting those buses. My argument with Greyhound is not with
the public, it's the working conditions.''
   The strike has been marked by scattered violence, including a
striker crushed to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver
in Redding, Calif.
   Gravley said the shooting was the third in Chicago since the
walkout began. Two occurred on the first day of the strike, with a
bus and a terminal the targets. Since then, there have also been
shootings in Ohio, Arizona, Florida and Connecticut.
   Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Hale said a $25,000 reward remained in
effect for information on a sniper who shot a bus in Jacksonville,
Fla., injuring eight passengers with shrapnel and other debris.
   Greyhound, which serves 9,600 U.S. communities, is operating
with replacement drivers and breakaway union members.
   Greyhound has said it cannot afford more than the $63 million,
three-year pact already turned down by more than 90 percent of
union members. But in previous negotiations, the company says it
agreed to drop incentive pay and to ban subcontracting or
franchising of routes.
   It valued the union's last offer at $207 million, although the
union says it would cost much less.

   The White House limousine pulled up to a
gleaming service station Tuesday and out popped President Bush to
pump a little methanol fuel and pitch his clean air program.
   Bush, surrounded by auto and oil executives, helped inaugurate
the new methanol fuel pump at Dave's Sunoco.
   Dave's boasts it is the first commercial gasoline station
outside California to sell the cleaner-burning fuel, a mix of 85
percent methanol and 15 percent unleaded gasoline.
   Bush, as part of his plan to clean America's air, originally
proposed requiring use of alternative fuels in 1 million vehicles
by 1997 in the nine cities with the worst pollution.
   In a compromise with Senate leaders, he recently backed away
from that requirement, opting instead for allowing cars to use a
variety of fuels, not specifically non-gasoline type fuels.
   Environmentalists charge that compromise weakened the clean air
package; the White House disagrees.
   While Bush spoke, demonstrators a block away carried placards
spelling out ``CLEAN AIR HYPOCRISY.''
   Bush defended his compromise, saying, ``Nobody ever does it
exactly the way I want it done. But what we have is a sound, strong
environmentally secure compromise.''
   ``We're never going to placate those on the extreme side of the
equation that want to do nothing or want to just shut down this
country and throw every American who's got a job out of work,''
said Bush.
   Only specially equipped cars can burn the methanol fuel. The
White House had one at the ready in the form of a commodious Ford
Crown Victoria normally used to chauffeur W. Henson Moore to work
as deputy secretary of the Energy Department.
   Bush, after pumping the fuel into Henson's car with an assist
from station owner David Robinson, turned the key in the ignition,
then listened to the Sun Oil Co. Chairman Robert McClements and
Ford Motor Co. Chairman Harold Poling explain how the alternative
fuel worked.
   A chart indicated that the methanol mix cuts smog-causing
hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides in half.
   Poling said ``flexible fuel vehicles'' such as the Crown
Victoria can burn methanol, ethanol, gasoline or any mix.
   The president's picture-taking session at the gas station
coincided with an announcement by Ford and a Sun Oil subsidiary of
a joint testing program to study use of methanol fuel outside the
mild climate of California.
   Ford will provide a fleet of 30 mid- and full-size cars and
full-size vans to be powered by a mixture of 85 percent methanol
and 15 percent gasoline, called M85, provided by Sun Refining and
Marketing Co.
   Bush said cleaner-burning fuels ``can help to reduce urban smog
and toxic air emissions'' and still ``reduce the regulatory
burden'' on small businesses.
   ``The availability of methanol in a metropolitan area like
Washington is an important step toward the widespread use of clean
fuels,'' he said.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William Reilly
said the compromise ``is a better deal for the environment''
because it will lead to less overall auto pollution in the nine
cities.
   Robinson, 56, said he is ``very high'' on his new offering,
which will sell for $1.07 a gallon at Dave's Sunoco, a penny less
than regular and two cents more than his cheapest fuel.
   Methanol contains less energy per gallon than gasoline, and the
$1.07 price works out to about the equivalent of $1.88 for the same
energy contained in a gallon of gasoline.
   Its advantage?
   ``Clean air, very clean air,'' the station owner said.

   You can tell the dancers in ``August Pace''
because there's a scorecard in the program and each dancer has a
number on the back of his or her running suit.
   The local premiere of ``August Pace,'' which consists mainly of
duets, opened the March 13 through 25 season of the Merce
Cunningham Dance Company at the City Center on Tuesday night.
   Cunningham used new collaborators on ``August Pace.'' The music,
titled ``Peace Talks,'' is by Michael Pugliese, who has been a
musician with the company since 1985. He often performs at
contemporary music festivals. He and four musicians made pops,
bongo drum and Oriental stringed instrument sounds, heard from
speakers at the back of the City Center. Sometimes, when music was
the fastest and most excitable, Cunningham slowed down the dancers
and played against the music's mood.
   Afrika, a 24-year-old Soviet painter, did decor and costumes.
   ``August Pace'' isn't striving for thrills; its organization
pushes the boundaries of ways bodies can stretch while dancing.
It's a hypnotic dance, partly because of the non-melodic music, but
there are definite changes of mood.
   In the first duet, Victoria Finlayson lifts one leg and bends as
far to her side and back as she can while Robert Swinston, at a
distance from her, moves in unrelated patterns. Carol Teitelbaum
stretches in fascinatingly athletic, angular ways. Kimberly
Bartosik and Chris Komar dart quickly. Several make big jumps
around the stage.
   Helen Barrow and Robert Wood exhibit solemn and serious body
language as they reach and stretch. Patricia Lent trustingly falls
forward and Alan Good catches her.
   All dancers looked inspired.
   The work was commissioned by Cal Performances-University of
California at Berkeley and the Cunningham Dance Foundation. Its
first performance was last September in Berkeley.
   Also danced during the evening were ``Fabrications,'' which had
its premiere in Minneapolis in 1987, and ``Cargo X,'' first danced
in Austin, Texas, in 1989. Cunningham danced in ``Fabrications.''
   There will be two more premieres here. After the season, the
company will perform April 14 to 16 in Amsterdam and from April 19
through May 2 in Italy, in Cremona, Modena, Bari, Reggio Emilia and
Ferrara. In June, the company will dance in Bobigny, France; the
Canary Islands; Florence, Italy, and Seville, Spain.

   An apartment fire killed five children
Tuesday, and neighbors accused police of stopping civilians from
attempting to rescue them even though one youngster was seen
screaming at an upstairs window.
   ``The whole neighborhood is upset,'' said Christine Lashore, a
resident of the Sommerset Circle low-income housing complex. ``The
police should've let them try. I would've tried. I would've died if
I had to, to save my kids.''
   Police Chief Wayne Romeis defended his officers' actions.
   ``People don't have any idea how intense it gets. I think the
response time was appropriate and the actions were appropriate,''
he said. ``If those people would have gone in there, there probably
would have been more victims.''
   Romeis said at a news conference that authorities received no
reports of screaming children from the first officers and
firefighters on the scene.
   ``I would bet you those kids were dead before we even got
there,'' Romeis said.
   The five brothers and sisters, ranging in age from 5 months to 9
years, were alone in the townhouse and were found in two
second-story bedrooms, officials said.
   The blaze started in the first-floor kitchen, Fire Chief Keith
Tveit said.
   The fire was in an end apartment of six two-story units in the
government-subsidized housing complex, which police said was often
a hang-out for people who didn't live in the complex. The fire
didn't spread to other apartments.
   Witnesses who gathered on the front lawn while firefighters
attempted to rescue the children said they could see the oldest boy
pounding on a bedroom window.
   ``That little boy was standing in the window. He was burning and
he was yelling, `Help me, help me,''' said neighbor Angela Briggs.
   Children also screamed from the top of a stairway, said Dessie
Cloak, who lives in an adjacent apartment.
   ``They were all at the top of the stairs hollering, `Here I am
Mommy, here I am, Mommy,''' she said.
   The victims' mother, Cheryl Robinson, told reporters she put the
children to bed about 9:30 p.m. Monday, went to sleep on a couch
and awoke to flames in the kitchen.
   She said the last time she saw her oldest son, he was standing
at the top of the staircase yelling for help.
   A police officer who spotted the fire when he drove past the
building about 2:30 a.m. and at least two other men tried to rescue
the children but were stopped by flames and heavy smoke,
authorities said.
   ``There were a couple the officers had to physically restrain
from going in,'' said Romeis. ``I believe one resident had already
tried and he was driven back.''
   Town records showed smoke alarms in the complex were working
during a Feb. 8 inspection. But fire department Lt. Fred Erickson
said reports from firefighters at the scene indicated the smoke
detectors weren't sounding during the blaze.
   Ms. Robinson said she had a smoke alarm, but it did not go off
until after she left the burning apartment.
   Lysundra Alawiye, a friend of the family, said the victims were
children of Cheryl Robinson, 28. Romeis said Ms. Robinson refused
to talk to officers Tuesday.
   Tveit identified the victims as Derek Robinson, 9; Kenneth
Jones, 5; Ebony Jones, 2; Cynthia Jones, 1; and Mark Robinson, 5
months.

   Record high temperatures in the 70s and 80s made Tuesday feel
like a day in June across much of the East, drawing winter-weary
people outside to sidewalk cafes and lunch-time strolls and
boosting sales of outdoor toys.
   ``That's the end of winter,'' said Danko Orbanich, sitting on
the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.
   Not necessarily. A storm hit Colorado and Wyoming with enough
snow Tuesday to snarl traffic and cut air traffic in half.
   The heat generated tornadoes in Kansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma
that killed a 6-year-old boy, injured 15 other people, damaged
scores of homes and derailed a 24-car freight train in Nebraska.
   Thunderstorms broke out across Illinois and the southern Plains
   ``This is just a preview of spring,'' David Koehler, a National
Weather Service meteorologist in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``There's still a
possibility we can get some snow before the end of winter, but if
we do, it won't stay around long.''
   Temperatures hit record or record-tying highs in Connecticut,
Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North
Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and the District of
Columbia.
   Most record high temperatures are reported in the heat of the
afternoon, but Grand Rapids, Mich., started out the day with a
record-tying 68 degrees at midnight. It later reached 72.
   Record reports from the weather service included 63 degrees at
Rochester, Minn.; 72 at Chicago and Cleveland; 78 at Pittsburgh; 88
at Raleigh; 84 at Philadelphia; 85 at New York City; 86 at Newark,
N.J.; 86 at Washington, D.C., and 69 at Concord, N.H.
   New York's reading was 38 degrees above normal, 14 degrees above
the record for the date set in 1929. It also was the city's warmest
day since Sept. 11, when the high was 91, and the earliest that the
temperature has reached 80 degrees in Central Park since record
keeping started in 1869. Just a week ago, the city had temperatures
in the low 30s.
   ``It's wonderful, it's great. Only problem is that if it gets
cold again everything that's blooming now is going to die,'' said
mounted Baltimore policeman David Eastman, 44.
   The unseasonable heat wave was great for anyone whose business
had anything to do with the outdoors, like Eddie Morrocco, whose
Morrocco's Italian Restaurant in downtown Washington, D.C., opened
up its outdoor tables.
   On Sunday, Morrocco said, they had no business outside.
   ``I've been doing outside business for at least 30 years and
we've never been able to open (outside) in March. Never,'' Morrocco
said.
   Merchants in South Carolina reported increased sales of
Frisbees, volleyball sets, tennis supplies and baseball and
softball equipment.
   ``The way the weather has been lately we've been selling more
walking shoes than anything else,'' said Kirk Hackett, assistant
manager of a shoe store in Fort Mill.
   The warm weather had people calling for service on their air
conditioning or to get replacement air conditioners in North
Carolina.
   ``We're swamped,'' said Ben Crabtree, in charge of the service
department at a heating and air conditioning company in Knightdale,
outside Raleigh.
   But it wasn't good business weather for everybody.
   ``The heating oil business is a dead soldier. It's deader than
George Washington,'' said Dick Jones, warehouse manager at an oil
company in Raleigh.
   And some outdoor activities also suffered.
   Lenny and Robin Wayne, tourists from Los Angeles visiting New
York City, took a few spins around the Rockefeller Center ice
skating rink, but left early. ``It's too hot to ice skate,'' Wayne
said.
   At least six tornadoes veered through Kansas and one made a
direct hit on Hesston, Kan., a town of 3,000 people. The tornado
killed a boy, wrecked nearly half the town and sent 13 people to
the hospital, said Newton Medical Center spokeswoman Chris
McKellip. Most had scratches, cuts and bruises.
   At least 10 homes were damaged near Topeka, Kan., and power
lines were down in other parts of Shawnee and Jefferson counties.
   ``There were at least two homes that were a total loss and a
number with varying degrees of damage, such as roof damage and
glass breakage,'' said Ken Burgett, director of emergency
preparedness in Shawnee County, Kan.
   One-third of Lawrence, Neb., a village of 350 people was damaged
by a twister. There were two minor injuries, the weather service
reported.
   The hot air spawned thunderstorms that rained golfball-size hail
on northwestern Illinois, generated winds that blew down power
lines and a barn at Malta, and posed threats of new flooding in
soggy Vermilion County, where 55,000 residents remained without
water service because flooding put water pumps out of action.
   Some of the 200 people forced from their homes because of
flooding along the North Fork River north of Danville returned home
to check damage. An estimated 19 mobile homes and cabins along the
river were destroyed.
   In the West, 5 inches of wet snow had fallen by midday at
Cheyenne, Wyo., just a week after a storm shut down much of
southeastern Wyoming.
   Denver's Stapleton International Airport had 3 inches by morning
and 13 inches had fallen at Wolf Creek Pass in southwestern
Colorado. Rush-hour traffic was slowed to a crawl, and Stapleton
cut its departures by more than half because of winds and poor
visibility.
   On the Plains, thunderstorms battered parts of Kansas, Oklahoma
and Texas with rain and wind.

   A television cameraman photographing
severe weather was shot and critically wounded Tuesday night in
apparently random violence, authorities said. Four people were
arrested.
   Bill Merickel, a photographer for Oklahoma station KWTV-TV, was
in critical condition at Lindsay Hospital following the 7:05 p.m.
shooting, said hospital administrator Rhonda Smith.
   KWTV spokesman Rich Buchanan said Merickel and reporter Dave
Balute had apparently stumbled on a drug deal, but McClain County
Sherff Dwayne Anderson later said that wasn't the case.
   ``There is no reason for the shooting that I can think of,''
said Anderson. ``A random shooting is what it looks like to me.''
   Anderson said the shooting occurred as Merickel and Balute were
out filming stormy weather.
   They had stopped at a highway intersection when a car pulled up
across from them, and two shots were fired from the vehicle, the
sheriff said.
   One shot penetrated the journalists' van and hit Merickel, who
was driving, in the chest, Anderson said. Balute was not hurt.
   The suspects' car left the scene, and was pursued by a second
KWTV car, which contacted police by radio, the sheriff said.
   The four suspects were arrested after a short chase by Lindsay
police, and were taken to the McClain County Jail, Anderson said.
Their identities were not immediately available.
   Lindsay is about 30 miles south of Oklahoma City.

   A briefing paper for Energy Secretary
James Watkins was inadvertently leaked and lists various problems
involving radiation contamination and reactor safety at weapons
plants around the nation.
   The daily briefing for Monday's operations was obtained by The
Associated Press after it was sent by mistake to governors' offices
by fax machine.
   The two-page summary contains reports by Department of Energy
operations to Watkins that were assembled by his office and were
being sent back to the DOE offices.
   The problems at the government's nuclear complex included
``widespread low-level contamination'' at a tank farm at Hanford,
Wash.; the discovery of three live wires at a Savannah River
reactor building that posed ``imminent danger,'' and an effort to
halt the activities of anti-nuclear protesters.

   Testing of an experimental vaccine on
California AIDS patients will be expanded and extended to
individuals who are infected with the AIDS virus but have not
developed symptoms of the disease.
   The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted permission
for further testing of the vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk.
   The vaccine, which uses an inactivated virus, is being tested as
a treatment for AIDS rather than as an agent to prevent someone
from acquiring the fatal disease, which destroys the body's ability
to fight infection.
   Researchers are trying to find out whether the inactivated virus
will cause the body to produce specific cells, called T cells, that
destroy other cells infected with the human immunodeficiency virus,
or HIV.

   Three Democrats waged a bare-fisted
struggle for the gubernatorial nomination in today's primary, while
a millionaire oilman making his first run for office was expected
to win the GOP nomination outright.
   The final pre-election poll showed former Gov. Mark White,
Attorney General Jim Mattox and Treasurer Ann Richards in a dead
heat for the Democratic nomination, with Clayton Williams gaining
more than half the Republican vote.
   The secretary of state's office predicted a turnout of 2.1
million to 2.6 million of the 8.3 million eligible voters, who can
vote in either primary. Each party's choice needs more than 50
percent of the vote to avoid a runoff.
   Williams said if he wins outright and the Democrats are forced
into a runoff April 10, he will relax and ``have some fun watching
each of the Democrats murdering on each other.''

   This is the city that says it knows how,
the one where tourists love to leave their hearts.
   But while most of the physical damage from the Oct. 17
earthquake has been repaired, community leaders are not sure how to
fix the damage done to San Francisco's reputation for warm if
eccentric hospitality.
   From cable cars to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf hotels to
theaters and museums, commercial and cultural business has been
reported way down since the quake.
   That may be changing, thanks to time and fading memories,
promotions, ad campaigns and a realization by the business
community that it must also deal with skyrocketing air fares,
recession fears and increasing competition.
   ``The earthquake is a very good excuse for everything,'' said
John Marks, president of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors'
Bureau. ``But there are many other factors that are causing the
momentary bump'' in tourism. Many tourist-oriented cities across
the country are experiencing similar sluggishness, he said.

   President Bush lifted trade sanctions against
Nicaragua on Tuesday and asked Congress to swiftly approve a $300
million down payment for rebuilding the nation's ravaged economy
and speeding a transition to democracy. He said the money would
come from the Pentagon.
   Rushing to shore up the incoming government of President-elect
Violeta Chamorro, Bush also pledged to seek an additional $200
million in fiscal 1991 which begins Oct. 1.
   Bush coupled the request for Nicaragua with a challenge to
Congress to approve a stalled aid package of $500 million for
Panama, where the United States installed a new government after
deposing Manuel Antonio Noriega last December. Bush also is seeking
$70 million in refugee assistance in Panama.
   The president urged Congress to complete work by April 5 on
money for both countries. All the funds would be diverted from the
Pentagon's budget, perhaps the first real ``peace dividend'' from
the receding Cold War.

   CARE, the relief group renowned for parachuting
food to the starving, is now packaging a more complex type of Third
World aid: seed money to start businesses and debt-for-equity
securities swaps.
   The New York-based non-profit organization has formed a
subsidiary to assist debt-ridden developing countries in devising
innovative ways to reduce dependence on foreign loans. It also
seeks to help creditors recover some of the money they thought
they'd never see again.
   CARE's Small Business Assistance Corp. invests in small and
medium-size businesses, from fruit canners in Honduras to shrimp
farmers in the Philippines, when invited to do so by the host
country. It also is exploring business ventures in countries
undergoing profound political change, including Poland and
Nicaragua.
   Philanthropy experts said the organization is the first
investment banking venture formed by an international relief group
to help developing countries become more self-reliant.

   The government said Tuesday that the deficit
in the broadest measure of U.S. trade sank to a five-year low last
year, but the $105.9 billion imbalance still pushed the country
deeper into the hole as the world's largest debtor nation.
   America's current account balance narrowed by 16 percent over a
$126.6 billion deficit in 1988, reflecting growth in exports,
higher overseas earnings of American businesses and increased
spending by visiting foreign tourists, according to the Commerce
Department.
   The year ended on a positive note as the October-December trade
deficit declined to $20.57 billion, down 10.2 percent from its
third quarter level. It was the smallest quarterly imbalance in
almost six years.
   But private economists were unimpressed, contending that even
with the improvement the current account deficit remained above
$100 billion for the sixth consecutive year as the United States
plunged further into hock to the rest of the world.

   Barry, who appeared relaxed and fit, said he was addicted to
alcohol and two prescription drugs, Valium and Xanax. He didn't

   He reacted with a broad smile to supporters' chants of ``Four

   Lyrics from the notorious 2 Live Crew album ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be'' tell the story:
   ``When they say 2 Live
   ``your mama gets worried.
   ``When they speak of us
   ``the negatives get mentioned.''
   Negatives abound with the popular rap group, whose sexually
explicit and misogynist songs have inflamed parents, church groups
and legislators.
   Some stores refuse to stock the album, or carry only a sanitized
version _ ``As Clean As They Wanna Be.'' It contains eight fewer
songs than the other album, and only one of them is a version of a
song from the unexpurgated LP _ the hit ``Me So Horny.''
   And a committee in the Florida state legislature is considering
a bill that would require retailers to label records deemed to have
so-called offensive material, and restrict sale to those over 18.
About a dozen other states are considering similar measures.
   Luther Campbell, a member of 2 Live Crew as well as the group's
producer and owner and president of its record label, Luke
Skyywalker Records, resents what he sees as attempts to censor his
work by keeping it out of the record stores.
   ``You don't have to buy it,'' he said. ``You just walk right on
by. It's sad to see walls coming down, letting people out of jail
in South Africa, and we're starting to tell people what they can
listen to and look at. If they stop that, I mean, what's next? This
is America.''
   However, Campbell, who calls himself Luke Skyywalker in the rap
group, said the company would offer retailers a sticker to warn
about language and offer parental discretion.
   There are 18 dirty, sassy tunes on ``As Nasty As They Wanna
Be.'' As lewd and disrespectful of women as many of the lyrics are,
production values are equally high. The sound is crisp and clear,
the sampling and scratching expert.
   ``We made our own style up,'' Campbell said. ``It is raunchy,
but it's really funny. ... It's no different than what Andrew
`Dice' Clay does, no different from Redd Foxx, Eddie Murphy.'' The
three stand-up comics are known for their off-color and sometimes
offensive material.
   In 1988, Tommy Hammond, a record store owner in Alexander City,
Ala., was convicted of violating the city's obscenity ordinance for
selling an earlier 2 Live Crew effort, ``Move Somethin'.'' The
conviction was overturned on appeal Feb. 22.
   Three days later, a Broward County judge ruled ``As Nasty As
They Wanna Be'' is probably obscene, but would have to consider a
specific case involving the LP to determine if it is obscene
according to state laws.
   The platinum double-album ``Nasty'' attracted the attention of a
judge in Lee County, Fla., who found probable cause to consider the
lyrics obscene. The album was pulled from store shelves.
   Dade State Attorney Janet Reno also is checking to see if minors
are being allowed to buy the album. She was the subject of a record
by female rappers Anquette _ also on the Miami-based Luke
Skyywalker label _ praising her office's efficiency in obtaining
child support payments from reluctant fathers.
   ``They don't recognize us for the clean stuff that we do,'' said
Campbell, who doesn't smoke or drink.
   Though the Crew has a well-deserved reputation for raunch, the
group is not without concern for its fans. Since 1988, they have
endorsed Homeboy brand condoms _ an arrangement they initiated,
according to Skyywalker spokeswoman Debbie Bennett.
   ``They figured since they were talking about sex so much they
should talk about safe sex,'' she said.
   While some are up in arms about the possible effect 2 Live
Crew's work may have on the young, Campbell is proud of his efforts
as an entrepreneur and the example he sets for black youngsters.
   ``A lot of black kids know of me and a lot of them want to be
like me,'' he said. ``They see some light down the tunnel. Very
seldom do they see the business blacks because those people aren't
widely known.''
   The Miami-born Campbell, 29, went from spinning records at high
school dances as a youngster to a corner office with a view of
Biscayne Bay, and a staff of 25. He established Luke Skyywalker
Records in 1985 after not getting paid for an earlier record.
   Several rappers record for Skyywalker, including Professor Griff
of Public Enemy. Campbell also owns the Skyyline label, which
records a few rhythm and blues artists.
   ``It's 50-50,'' he said of his dual life as record company
executive and rap star. ``I work at night as an artist and in the
day time I'm a businessman.''
   Today, he still seems a bit awed by his own success.
   ``Knowing the business as I know it now and seeing as many
people fail _ but I guess that's how I do a lot of things,'' he
said.
   ``I just decide to do them.''

<HEAD>CBS' ``Peanuts'' Special on Leukemia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Are you going to die?'' asks Charlie Brown
when Janice, his little friend in the hospital bed, says she has
leukemia.
   ``Good grief, Charlie Brown!'' cries Linus. ``What kind of
question is that?''
   A blunt one, asked in a different kind of ``Peanuts'' special
that CBS is showing Friday night. Rest assured, though, that the
ending is upbeat, in keeping with medical fact and the nature of
Charles M. Schulz.
   Schulz, who has drawn the wise and whimsical characters of his
``Peanuts'' cartoon strip since 1950 and did his first TV special
in 1965, hadn't thought of making his next one about a child who
develops leukemia.
   What became Friday's ``Why, Charlie Brown, Why?'' began, he
says, with an idea from Sylvia Cook, a nurse in California who
works with young cancer patients at Stanford Children's Hospital.
   She proposed a five-minute film for them in which cancer and its
treatment were explained by the ``Peanuts'' gang. He recalls that
he pointed out a few problems, including that animation is
expensive.
   That didn't stop Cook, Schulz says.
   ``Gradually, her idea changed, and she finally decided that it'd
be more important if we could do a film that would show the people
around the person who was ill just what is going on,'' he says.
   Wth the aid of the American Cancer Society, that's ultimately
what happened. It helped that Schulz came to believe the film would
make a good ``Peanuts'' special for TV and shouldn't be limited to
hospital showings.
   The gentle lessons of Friday's show include the early symptoms
of leukemia and what can be expected in treatment of the disease.
   A key part of the program _ the survival rate of children
stricken with leukemia _ is only obliquely noted, mainly because a
mass of statistics would be as out of place in a ``Peanuts''
special as a visit from The Simpsons.
   Little Janice, in chemotherapy treatment that she notes will
cause her temporary hair loss, quotes her doctors as saying she
should get well.
   The survival rate for children is high, according to ACS
spokesman David Lehmann. He says the society estimates 2,500
children will be stricken with leukemia this year, 1,900 of them
with its acute form.
   However, thanks to advances in treatment, 71 percent are
expected to survive, he says.
   Schulz, who worked with the society in preparing Friday's
special, downplays his role in it.
   ``I didn't go into making this thing because I wanted to teach
the world all about this,'' he says. ``This was the idea of the
cancer people. It was their project. My only job was to make it
palatable, to give it some kind of story and try to tell the things
they wanted told, yet make it so that people wouldn't turn it off.''
   Schulz, 67, who lives in Santa Rosa, Calif., about an hour's
drive north of San Francisco, estimates Friday's is his 25th TV
special since ``A Charlie Brown Christmas.''
   He still draws the seven-day-a-week ``Peanuts'' strip that by
CBS' estimate appears in more than 2,200 newspapers worldwide. He
reckons he's drawn 15,000 of the strips since he began them 40
years ago.
   More than a few cartoonist have groused that the constant
pressure of a daily strip at times has put them up against the
wall, if not under it. No such gripes are heard from Schulz.
   ``No, quality is the only thing that worries me,'' he says. ``I
don't worry about getting them done. I'm always worrying that I'll
just end up doing the same things over and over.
   ``Just to try to keep the thing alive, and be trying new things,
that's the hard part. Just getting it done is nothing. I think
cartoonists who say it's hard to keep up the schedule are just
lazy, that's all.''

   IT`S NOT EASY BEING GREEN: Cable TV's Nick at Nite has a special
St. Patrick's Day treat afoot Saturday night. It will show four
episodes of ``My Three Sons'' _ with each episode tinted green. The
idea is to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, a day on which many lads in
New York, to the disgust of the real Irish, drink themselves into a
terrible state, punch each other in the beak and also turn green.

   Years of plummeting land values, low grain
prices and a scorching drought made tractor dealer Dick Rupiper
uneasy about his chances for survival after 10 years in
farm-machinery sales.
   But Rupiper gambled last year and moved his business. Now he is
planning to expand his staff to handle steadily increasing demand.
   ``The drought of '88 set everybody back,'' Rupiper said. ``In
1989, we had decent crops. Farmers had a decent year and it was the
first year in a long time they felt comfortable spending money.
   ``I think 1990 will be even better. I expect things to pick up a
little more.''
   Rupiper's experience parallels that of the tractor and
farm-machinery industry, which is earning solid profits and hopes
to increase sales this year.
   Last year, Rupiper was struggling to keep afloat. In Illinois,
1,500 tractor dealers have gone out of business since 1949, leaving
about 400, according to figures compiled by the Illinois Retail
Farm Equipment Association.
   ``There's just too many dealers in this area and I was worried
about our survival,'' Rupiper said.
   So he liquidated his inventory _ which included equipment from
four smaller manufacturers _ closed the farm dealership he owned in
Henry and bought a Deere &amp; Co. dealership across the Illinois River
in this town of 2,100, about 25 miles north of Peoria.
   Business prospects are looking up.
   ``We're thinking about hiring a couple people to help out in the
shop,'' Rupiper said. ``I expect things to continue to improve.''
   He also expects farmers to show increasing concern about soil
conservation and environmental protection. But the process of
changing to meet those concerns will be slow and expensive.
   No-till farming, for example, a soil-conservation method that
involves shallow plowing and leaves more crop residue in fields _
requires an investment in costly new tilling, planting and mulching
equipment.
   Farmers must be convinced they'll still get maximum yields and
will be able to pass along the higher equipment costs to consumers
before they'll invest, Rupiper said.
   Moline-based Deere, the nation's leading producer of tractors
and farm machinery, is promoting a line of minimum-tillage
equipment.
   But the traditional moldboard plow is far from obsolete, and
implements designed for no-till farming remain a small part of
Deere's product line.
   ``Conservation in farming is here to stay,'' says Deere
spokesman Robert Combs. ``But we're not even close to replacing the
tractor or combine.''
   The evolution to more conservation-minded, ecologically aware
farming is not expected to hurt sales of farming equipment in 1990.
   The U.S. Department of Commerce says higher crop prices,
improved land values and reduced farm debt will combine with the
need to replace aging equipment for a 6 percent increase in sales
this year.
   A 7 percent sales increase was predicted by both the Farm and
Industrial Equipment Institute in Chicago, an industry-supported
think tank, and Stark's Off-Highway Ledger, a Chicago-based
newsletter that analyzes the industry.
   Combs said Deere projects solid sales increases, noting
production schedules are 5 percent higher than last year.
   Deere recorded $380 million in profits in 1989, its second
consecutive record-breaking year.
   Steve Koep, marketing director for Case IH of Racine, Wis., said
his company's 1989 rebound should continue into the '90s.
   Koep said Case reported earnings of $288 million in 1989, its
first profit since 1981, when the company earned $70 million.
   Factors pointing to higher sales include pent-up demand among
farmers who kept old equipment during the farm crisis of the 1980s
rather than risk going deeper in debt to buy tractors, which
average $60,000, or combines, which average $110,000.
   ``We see a generally improving economic picture for farmers
across the board,'' said Emmett Barker, president of the Farm and
Industrial Equipment Institute.

   Composer John Corigliano planned to use his
Chicago Symphony Orchestra commission to write a virtuoso piece
showcasing its musicians. But when his best friend was diagnosed
with AIDS, he found new inspiration.
   Corigliano's tragic First Symphony, incorporating remembrances
of musicians who have died from disease brought on by AIDS, will
have its world premiere Thursday at the Chicago Symphony, with
Daniel Barenboim conducting.
   ``The difference between the Concerto for Orchestra I was going
to write and the symphony I did write is largely a question of
emotional depth and content,'' Corigliano said in a recent
telephone interview from his home in Carmel, N.Y. ``The deaths of
friends _ the loss, the frustration and anger _ inspired me to
write it
   ``I just turned 52, and my mother lives in a retirement
community. ... To me, it's a major upset in the natural order that
my friends should be dying off faster than hers.
   ``It took me two years to put the symphony together, and I wrote
the end of it first,'' he said. ``I had to find where I was going _
find peace, perhaps _ before I could describe the journey.''
   Barenboim, who is succeeding Sir Georg Solti as music director
of the Chicago Symphony, praised Corigliano's work.
   ``I'm very pleased to be doing the world premiere of a
substantial American piece so early in my time in Chicago,''
Barenboim said. ``It is wonderful that composers such as John
Corigliano write music that is not disassociated from our society
but reflects our everyday life and the problems we face as human
beings.''
   Chicago composer William Russo, whose jazz- and rock-influenced
works often touch on social themes, cited it as probably the first
AIDS symphony.
   ``Many other people have written works inspired by the epidemic,
but no one of John's scope, musically, has done anything like
this,'' he said.
   Central to the symphony is the image of the AIDS Quilt, which
Corigliano first saw in Washington several years ago.
   ``I was overwhelmed,'' he said. ``It managed to combine vastness
with extreme intimacy. Each of the thousands of squares was crafted
individually by the loved ones of the victim.''
   To create his own patchwork effect for the third movement,
Corigliano gave the names of acquaintances who had died to William
H. Hoffman, librettist of Corigliano's opera, ``The Ghosts of
Versailles.'' Hoffman wrote ``brief poetic epitaphs'' for the
symphony.
   ``I took the epitaphs, composed melodic fragments for each of
them, discarded the words and wove the melodies together,'' the
composer explained. ``They are played against one of the main
themes of the movement.''
   Corigliano, composer-in-residence at the Chicago Symphony since
1987, fit his main themes to several close friends from the New
York musical world who died from AIDS-related diseases.
   ``I knew each of them for more than 25 years,'' he said.
   Although the music refers to real people, their full names are
never given.
   ``Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to AIDS,''
Corigliano said. ``Even when people die of its complications, the
obituaries often give the cause of death as something else. There's
a bitter irony that that still has to be the case.''
   The first movement, ``Of Rage and Remembrance,'' reflects
Corigliano's distress over the death of a concet pianist friend and
begins in a manner he describes as ``ferocious.''
   Midway through, though, an off-stage piano plays a
turn-of-the-century tango that was a favorite of the dead musician.
   ``The rest of the movement alternates between the tension of
anger and the bittersweet nostalgia of remembering,'' Corigliano
said.
   The second movement, ``Tarantella,'' recalls a gifted amateur
musician who became an executive in the music industry, and is
based on ``a jaunty little piece'' Corigliano wrote for him in 1970.
   ``There's savage irony and nightmare in it,'' said the composer.
   ``My friend was a brilliant, witty man, but he concealed the
fact that he had AIDS until dementia set in just before his death.
You would sit at lunch with him and realize that he was slipping
off into insanity.
   ``In Italian folklore, the tarantella is a dance that is
supposed to cure the insanity caused by the bite of the tarantula _
but in this case, it's a dance that descends into madness,'' said
Corigliano, who earlier used nightmare material in his score for
the 1985 movie ``Altered States.''
   The third movement, ``Giulio's Song,'' takes one of its main
themes from an improvised melody used by ``Giulio,'' an amateur
cellist, while playing with Corigliano in 1962.
   The ``Giulio'' theme eventually leads to memories of his cello
teacher, another AIDS victim, and then into the ``Quilt'' material
for other departed friends.
   Eventually, the underlying rhythm is revealed as that of a
funeral march.
   The symphony ends peacefully, Corigliano said, with repeating
waves of chords from a brass choir that partly encircles the
orchestra.
   ``To me, the sound of ocean waves conveys an image of
timelessness,'' he said.

   Sir David Lean can only laugh at how calmly
Hollywood is taking this year's ``foreign invasion'' of the Academy
Awards:
   ``My Left Foot'' from Ireland, five nominations including best
picture; Camille Claudel'' from France, two nominations including
best foreign film; ``Henry V'' from England, three nominations
including best director.
   Yet, it's business as usual at the Oscars. There are, of course,
the usual arguments over who made it and who didn't, but nothing
like the press conference called by Samuel Goldwyn in 1946, when
Lean's ``Brief Encounter'' and Laurence Olivier's ``Henry V'' were
among several foreign films enjoying critical and commercial
success.
   ``Hollywood is facing a challenge,'' said Goldwyn, producer of
such films as ``Wuthering Heights'' and ``The Little Foxes.''
   ``Today it is by the British, tomorrow it may be the French or
the Italians or the Russians. To maintain it's place, Hollywood
must set aside the old formulas. It must find honest stories,
stories with something important to say, stories that reflect these
disturbing times in which we live.''
   Lean was amazed by Goldwyn's warning because he was sure ``Brief
Encounter'' would flop. After all, the film had closed down after
three days in one Italian city because, the British filmmaker had
heard, leading man Trevor Howard was too ugly.
   So when ``Brief Encounter'' was previewed at a tiny screening
room in Manhattan, Lean did his best to slip in and out unnoticed.
It didn't work.
   ``I waited until the lights went out and snuck in the back
because I just wanted to see what sort of print would be there,''
Lean said in a recent phone interview from Los Angeles, where he
received the American Film Institute's annual Life Achievement
Award.
   ``When the lights went up, I sneaked out. I got a few steps down
the passage, and a voice said, `Hi, excuse me.' It was the critic
from Time. `He said, `Tell me, did you direct that?' And I said,
`You're right, I did,' thinking he was going to say God knows what.
He said, `Let me shake your hand, that was marvelous.'
   ``And that was the first time I knew I was going to get a break
in America.''
   ``Brief Encounter'' received three nominations (but won no
Oscars) and Lean eventually felt right at home at the Academy
Awards, totaling 56 nominations and 27 awards for such films as
``Great Expectations,'' ``A Passage to India,'' ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   Since 1932 when Charles Laughton won best actor for the title
role in a British production of ``The Private Life of Henry VIII,''
Oscar has had an ambivalent relationship with foreign movies.
Hollywood preferred American products to win, but constantly
recognized worthy foreign efforts.
   Foreign films, especially British, have won various prizes from
cinematography (``Black Narcissus'') to best picture (``Hamlet''),
from screenwriting (``The Search'') to costume design (``La Dolce
Vita'').
   In 1956, foreign language film became a separate category.
Italy's ``La Strada'' won that year. But that didn't stop the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from nominating foreign
films and filmmakers in other categories. In 1966, the French film
``A Man and a Woman'' won a screenplay Oscar and was also named
best foreign film. In 1973, Sven Nykvist won the cinematography
award for Sweden's ``Cries and Whispers.''
   The British have dominated the Oscars on several occasions,
including ``Lawrence of Arabia'' in 1962, ``Tom Jones'' in 1963,
``Chariots of Fire'' in 1981 and ``A Room With a View'' in 1986.
   ``The Academy Awards in some ways is the absolute tops for a
moviemaker; you can't do better,'' Lean said. ``It's terrific to
get and I never thought I would get one.''
   Lean's favorite of his own films is ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
which was released in 1962 and earned seven Academy Awards,
including best picture and director.
   An ``adventure of a lifetime'' is how Lean remembered the 19
months of location work for the film. ``Anybody who can go out and
live in the desert for a year is a lucky man,'' he said of the
title character.
   For the starring role, he wanted Albert Finney, one of Britain's
hottest young actors at the time, but after four days of testing,
Finney turned him down. Lean took a chance and cast a then unknown
Peter O'Toole.
   ``I was desperate because I didn't have a leading man,'' Lean
said. ``I went to a theater in the West End and I saw a film called
`The Day They Robbed the Bank of England,' and in it was Peter
playing a small part. I had never seen him before. As he came on
the screen, I thought, `Wait a minute, that's a star.'''
   But it's not as much fun anymore, insists Lean, who has made
just two films in the past 20 years: ``Ryan's Daughter'' and ``A
Passage to India.'' There's too much talk about money, and ever
since ``Easy Rider'' in 1969, producers have been looking for hit
films that cost little to make.
   The director even longs for the return of bosses such as
Goldwyn, tirades and all.
   ``Hollywood was something special,'' Lean said. ``Those chaps
like Goldwyn, they were uneducated, but all of them, however tough,
whatever they were, they just loved movies and sought quality. Now,
it's, `How much?'''
   Lean spoke of a recent dinner with Billy Wilder, another
Oscar-winning director and AFI honoree who has struggled to find
work. They talked about the problems of being part of Hollywood
history in a business that's always looking ahead.
   ``When you get over 80 the pressures are worse than they ever
were,'' said Lean, who turns 81 on March 25, the day before the
Academy Awards presentation.
   ``Billy's bright as a button, really entertaining and really
quick. You would think by the way he's treated, he's just
beginning. Anybody who makes `The Apartment' and `Some Like It Hot'
should be up in the highest position.''
   Fortunately, Lean said, he likes the young directors who greeted
him so warmly on his recent trip. He is especially enthusiastic
about Oliver Stone and predicts that Stone and other directors will
eventually take control of Hollywood from the agents and lawyers.
   Stone recently won the Directors Guild award for his ``Born on
the Fourth of July,'' which has received eight Oscar nominations
including best picture.
   ``The filmmakers in Hollywood I think are very special. They're
really keen and they're all bright and intelligent and they've got
a sense of humor. They are full of enthusiasm that doesn't seem to
be at all envious of others,'' Lean said.
   ``They just give it to you on a plate. It's very nice for an old
bird to get that.''

<HEAD>Syrians Soldiers Watch for Attempts To Move Hostages Out of Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian soldiers guard gateways of two
Shiite Moslem slum districts in south Beirut in case kidnappers try
to smuggle out Terry Anderson or other Western hostages, police say.
   ``I am sure they are all alive,'' Sheik Mohammed Mehdi
Shamseddin, spiritual head of Lebanon's Shiite community, said
recently. ``That much I can safely ascertain.''
   Other senior Shiite sources who claimed to know also said that
the captives were alive and that most were in south Beirut. All
agreed to talk about the situation only if granted anonymity.
   Police said Syrian troops had tightened control around the
Hajjaj and Hay Madi districts. Syria has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon
under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976, the year
after the sectarian civil war began.
   ``They are searching everything coming out from both
neighborhoods, where most of the hostages are thought to be
imprisoned _ even funeral processions and caskets,'' said a police
spokesman, whose name cannot be used under standing regulations.
   Syrian soldiers have not tried to storm any suspected hideouts
of kidnappers, apparently for fear of killing hostages.
   Seventeen Westerners are missing in Lebanon and believed to be
hostages, including eight Americans.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, has been held longest. He was abducted five years ago, on
March 16, 1985.
   The captives have been moved often, in car trunks or coffins,
either to escape fighting among Shiite factions or to avoid
detection.
   French journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, freed in 1988, said he
nearly suffocated in a box that was slung beneath a truck.
   Anderson, 42, was said to have been chained to a basement wall
of a ruined Beirut hotel during his early days as a captive.
   Freed hostages have said they, too, were held in basements, or
sometimes in upper-floor apartments with no access to windows.
   All said they heard jet planes landing and taking off, which
supports the belief that most hostages are in the southern slums
near Beirut's airport.
   Shiites claiming to be close to the kidnappers often have
approached news agencies in Beirut offering to help free Anderson
or Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, in return for as much as $1
million for each hostage. None of the offers was believed to be
legitimate.
   Waite, 50, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotel in
Moslem west Beirut to negotiate for the freedom of Anderson and
other Americans.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran has asked pro-Iranian
factions in Lebanon grouped under the umbrella of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, to free the hostages. But the Shiite sources in
Beirut believe Rafsanjani has little influence with the militant
Hezbollah wing that controls the hostage-holders.
   Hezbollah militants are loyal to Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the
hard-line former interior minister of Iran, who helped found
Hezbollah while he was Iran's ambassador to Syria in the early
1980s. Anderson is held by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad, or
Islamic Holy War.
   ``Rafsanjani's hostage behests are a cry without an echo,'' said
a senior Shiite source. ``Rafsanjani wants a deal with the United
States to unblock Tehran's frozen assests to cope with Iran's
economic crisis, which is generating anti-government public
sentiment.
   ``Mohtashemi and other hard-line opposition leaders have a stake
in maintaining the crisis so they can agitate against Rafsanjani,
so no hostages are likely to be released in the near future.''
   The United States holds billions of dollars in Iranian assets
that were frozen after the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
in 1979. Fifty-two Americans were held 444 days.
   Rafsanjani and other Iranian leaders have said Iran would help
get the hostages in Lebanon released if the United States freed the
assets.
   This week, Mohtashemi said some of the captives were spies and
argued against freeing any of the ``mercenary U.S. hostages.''
   Support for the hard-liners came March 6 when a group holding
American hostages Joseph Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy broke a
seven-month silence to say no captives were about to be freed.
   ``There is no intention to release hostages,'' said the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, which also threatened suicide
attacks on U.S. interests.
   Shiite sources said the next hostage release might come from
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds American
college teachers Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner.
   Hussein Mousawi, a pro-Syrian activist based in the Bekaa Valley
of east Lebanon, now controls the group. The sources said
Mohtashemi loyalists recently removed Mousawi from the Hezbollah
leadership.

<HEAD>One Year Later, Nation's Worst Oil Spill Is Hidden But Not Gone</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PERRY ISLAND, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From a helicopter, the wave-washed
beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never
touched it.
   Silvery sticks of driftwood poke through a deep blanket of snow,
and smooth gray pebbles roll in the surf under the gaze of a bald
eagle perched in a shoreside spruce.
   But the view doesn't impress Joe Bridgman of the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation. Dashing out as the
chopper lands, he digs into the cobble beach and quickly finds what
he knew he would.
   ``Oil,'' he says. ``Smell it?''
   The pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole
turns black with crude oil, an oozing remnant of the 10.8 million
gallons spilled into Prince William Sound last March 24 by the
tanker Exxon Valdez.
   Bridgman scoops up a shovelful of gravel, lugs it to the water's
edge and dumps it in. A rainbow sheen of oil spreads across the
water.
   ``Hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach,''
he says. ``And this isn't isolated. There are hundreds of beaches
all over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly
bleeding out.
   ``The beaches can look beautiful at the surface, but you can dig
down, in this case just a few inches below the surface, and find
lots of oil. Now, is that a threat or isn't it?''
   A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the question clings
like the oil under this Perry Island beach. Certainly, the worst is
over; thousands of dead birds no longer wash up on shorelines as
they did last summer.
   But assessing the continuing damage wrought by the nation's most
extensive _ and expensive _ oil spill has just begun. As a growing
slick of lawyers haggles over who is to blame, Exxon Corp. and
government agencies debate how to clean up what's left and
scientists track wildlife populations' first steps on the long road
to recovery.
   Any hope of a quick solution faded last summer as oil from the
Exxon Valdez spread across 1,100 miles of Alaska's wild southern
coast.
   A cleanup army of 12,000 workers polished rocks by hand, blasted
beaches with hot water and sprayed fertilizer to promote the growth
of oil-eating microbes.
   But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in
mid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the
oil spilled, state officials estimate. About 20 percent to 40
percent is believed to have evaporated. That leaves 50 percent to
75 percent of the oil in the water, on the ocean bottom or on
beaches.
   Some was soaked up by unwilling sponges: the seabirds, eagles
and sea otters whose carcasses now lie frozen in five vans in an
Anchorage storage yard, awaiting their day as physical evidence in
court.
   Workers found more than 1,000 dead otters, a sizable chunk of
the spill area's total population of 15,000 to 22,000.
   Many of Prince William Sound's 3,000 bald eagles also suffered;
at least 151 died, most poisoned by scavenging the oily remains of
some of the 34,400 dead seabirds recovered.
   Those numbers alone make the Valdez spill the most lethal ever,
but scientists say the actual death count is much higher,
estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank
from sight or drifted out to sea.
   Exxon notes the spill did not wipe out any species and says
surviving animals and birds will rebuild populations. But that may
take up to 70 years for some hard-hit seabird colonies, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service researchers say.
   ``We never claimed that the spill put any animal on the
endangered species list, but that's missing the point,'' said Fish
and Wildlife spokesman Bruce Batten. ``It's still the greatest
human-caused wildlife disaster that this agency knows about.''
   Oily carcasses were an obvious measure of the spill's impact,
but victims also included less visible members of the ecosystem,
such as young salmon and tiny intertidal creatures.
   Assessment studies for these populations are not finished, and
even preliminary findings are hard to come by _ researchers have
been told by lawyers to save their findings for court, where it
seems nearly everyone involved in the spill is headed.
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, skipper of the Exxon Valdez, is on trial
this month in Anchorage on charges including criminal mischief and
drunken driving of his vessel, and a federal grand jury recently
issued criminal indictments against Exxon, starting a case that
could take years to finish.
   Exxon already faces more than 150 civil lawsuits.
   Fishermen sued because of lost seasons. Tour-boat operators sued
because fewer people wanted to cruise an oiled sound. The state
sued, claiming the company was negligent in responding to the
spill, only to be countersued by Exxon, which claimed state
officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have
broken up large quantities of oil early on.
   Information about the spill is filtered through this litigious
atmosphere, making much of it suspect. Exxon distributes
before-and-after pictures of cleaned beaches; Bridgman and other
state officials, accusing Exxon of ``myth-making,'' eagerly make
room for journalists on flights to oiled beaches.
   State officials cite an October survey that showed 117 miles of
shoreline remained moderately or heavily oiled, with oil more than
two feet deep in some spots. They say observers flying over the
sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily.
   Exxon officials, meanwhile, say their winter monitoring of 64
sites shows wind and waves have scoured away, on average, more than
half the surface oil left in September, and up to 80 percent of the
buried oil.
   ``From a layman's point of view, what's left out there is really
insignificant,'' said Exxon scientist Andy Teal.

   Both the state and Exxon figures may be accurate, but even the
best studies of the spill's effects are mere snapshots of a rugged,
sparsely populated region the size of New Jersey, Maryland and
Delaware combined.
   The Coast Guard has declared some sort of cleanup must resume
May 1, but nobody has committed to how much or what kind. Decisions
will be made after another survey of beach conditions next month.
   In general, exposed beaches eroded by winter storms appear to
have fared the best, but surface oil remains thick in many
sheltered coves and estuaries.
   Areas with oil hidden beneath the surface, such as the Perry
Island beach Bridgman visited, may prove the most troublesome.
State officials believe many of those beaches would benefit from
intensive work, such as digging up gravel, tumbling it in
rock-washing machines and replacing it.
   While that would kill nearly all living organisms, it would
provide a clean slate for populations to rebuild, said Steve
Provant, the Department of Environmental Conservation's spill
coordinator.
   But Exxon officials say such intrusive techniques could do more
harm than good.
   Some federal authorities are inclined to agree, recalling last
summer's heavy-handed invasion of the Alaska wilderness.
   Frightened animals had to flee repeatedly from buzzing
helicopters, and cleanup crews left behind tons of plastic boom
material, absorbent pompons and other litter on previously pristine
beaches. Even scientists made their mark, painting rocks with
flourescent paint and tying orange plastic flagging to trees.
   ``You can see these things a mile away, and they're in areas
where people otherwise would be having a quality wilderness
experience,'' said Nancy Lethcoe, a sailboat-tour operator in
Valdez.
   Lethcoe remembers a Prince William Sound where you could stand
on a lonely beach and feel you were the first human ever there. It
was a place where the world still felt big. Now the world seems
suddenly smaller, civilization's reach extended by the greasy
fingers of an oil spill.
   Lethcoe said she'll leave the blaming to the lawyers. When she
goes out on the sound these days, she focuses on nature's
recuperative powers. It works until she discovers that oil has
found another of her favorite hideaways.
   ``When I know an area is oiled, I can brace myself,'' she said.
``But when I find an area that wasn't supposed to be oiled, it
brings back the whole trauma of the spill. It brings back the
pain.''

<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guns, drugs, ethnic violence and
fractious politics have infected the largest city in Pakistan. Some
fear the new democracy will not survive.
   Political parties fight pitched battles in the cramped
alleyways; 60 people were killed and hundreds wounded Feb. 7.
Paramilitary forces still patrol Karachi and a curfew continues in
some districts.
   The universities are closed and gangs of student extremists have
turned them into armed camps. Kidnappings and torture are
commonplace.
   Unemployment is rampant. Government officials say they have no
way to count the people looking for work.
   A gram of heroin costs less than $2. A decade ago the drug was
hardly found in Pakistan. Now Karachi has 300,000 addicts,
one-third of the nation's total.
   Automatic weapons used to be rare in Karachi; today you can rent
a Kalashnikov assault rifle for $5 a day. Bands of robbers roam the
countryside and car thieves operate throughout the city.
   Many residents say the police are either corrupt or incompetent.
Police say they are outnumbered and outgunned wih one officer to
458 citizens, one of the lowest ratios in South Asia.
   ``Karachi, once a city of peace, tranquility and affluence, has
turned almost into Beirut,'' Mahmood Ali Malik, a noted
psychologist, wrote in The Pakistan Times.
   ``The army is certainly waiting in the wings,'' said Ahmed Ali
Khan, editor of the Dawn, the largest English-language newspaper.
``Increased chaos could threaten our democracy.''
   Eleven years of martial law ended two years ago after Gen.
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the president, was killed in a plane crash.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, elected in November 1988, presides
over a shaky government.
   Any problem Pakistan has, Karachi appears to have in greater
measure. Because of its size and importance, Karachi's problems
have national scope.
   Eight million people live in the city, which sprawls on the
sun-baked coast of the Arabian Sea. It is Pakistan's economic
center and the only major port.
   Three layers of interwoven troubles weigh on the city and the
rest of Sind province, which surrounds Karachi: ethnic strife,
social breakdown and a newer phenonmenon called ``the heroin and
Kalashnikov culture.''
   Guns have been plentiful in Pakistan ever since Soviet military
forces entered Afghanistan in December 1978 and the U.S.-supported
Afghan rebels moved their bases to Pakistan.
   Millions of dollars in U.S. aid to the rebels helped finance a
huge arms trade in northern Pakistan. Simultaneously, the making of
heroin became an important source of income for Afghan refugees and
indigenous tribes in the area.
   Weapons accompanied the narcotics south to Karachi, a main
conduit for heroin to Western Europe and the United States. About
6,000 pounds of heroin were seized in Karachi in the last half of
1989, more than double the total for 1986 and 10 times the amounts
of earlier years.
   Shootings of law enforcement officers are frequent. A ranking
customs agent was shot six times in the face and leg as he left his
home last June on what was to be a secret raid. He survived.
   Drugs and guns in the city combine with increasing crime in the
surrounding countryside. Disputes formerly resolved by a village
headman now are settled with guns, historian Hamida Khoura said.
   ``We face an institutional breakdown throughout the province,''
said Fakhruddin Ibrahim, governor of Sind province. ``Chaos is
ruling,'' and police can do little to stop it.
   ``The police in Pakistan have always been a political tool,'' he
said in an interview. ``Years of martial law taught them that. I
don't see it changing.''
   Add ethnic strife and the situation becomes increasingly
volatile.
   Ever since the subcontinent was divided into India and Pakistan
in 1947, at the end of British colonial rule, Karachi has been
Pakistan's closest thing to a melting pot.
   Pathans and Punjabis moved south to make a fast rupee in the
port city. Sindhis came from the countryside to sell their produce.
Immigrants called Mohajirs, flooded into Moslem Pakistan from
predominantly Hindu India.
   Nothing melted in the pot, however, and trouble between rival
ethnic groups began in the 1950s.
   Ethnic strife acquired political overtones in 1985 with
formation of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, which sought to represent
the interests of immigrants from India.
   Mohajirs say they are discriminated against by the provincial
government, which Sindhis dominate. They want more jobs and
official recognition of their ethnic group.
   Their movement has become an important political force because
Mohajirs are more numerous than any other group in the cities of
Sind province, including Karachi.
   Altaf Hussain leads the movement. The former pharmacy student,
known for strirring speeches, ever-present sunglasses and opulently
ringed fingers, has adopted ``Sell your TV and buy a gun!'' as his
battle cry.
   ``We are a new phenonmenon, a party of destiny,'' Hussain said
in an interview. ``We are the first party to represent the
oppressed and suppressed masses. I am the chosen leader.''
   Karachi politics went national when Hussain united with the
national opposition in an attempt to bring down the Bhutto
government.
   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, based in Sind, had an
alliance with Hussain during the campaign but tended to ignore
Mohajir interests after winning the election.
   In November, she barely defeated a no-confidence vote in the
National Assembly when the 14 members from the Mohajir movement
voted against her.
   On Feb. 7, Hussain called for a general strike in Karachi to
protest what he described as persecution by her party. Scores of
people were killed in clashes between police and gunmen of both
parties.
   More than 200 kidnappings were reported. Victims were tortured
with electric drills, castration and multiple cigarette burns.
   On March 2, talks began between Hussain's group and the Bhutto
party.
   ``We all realize that things have gotten as bad as they can
get,'' said Nafees Siddiqi, a top official of the Pakistan People's
Party in Sind. ``If things get worse, the army could roll back in.''
   Structural problems stand in the way of political peace.
   Pakistan has been under martial law for 20 of the last 30 years
and now has an extremely centralized system. Many observers say
violent politics will continue until some authority devolves to
cities and provinces.
   ``Now everybody can be an extremist because none of them has
real authority,'' said Ibrahim, the provincial governor. ``Give
them a budget and they'll become moderates.''
   Ansar Burney, who fights for prisoner rights and against drug
abuse in Karachi, says few residents have the national interest at
heart.
   ``No one in Karachi thinks about the public good,'' he said.
``They're just obsessed with power and guns.''

   An angry college dropout has formed a
strong political movement in the streets of Pakistan's biggest city
and taken as his battle cry: ``Sell your TV and buy a gun!''
   Altaf Hussain, a 36-year-old former student of pharmacy, has
maneuvered into a key position in Pakistan's politics, tapping
ethnic anger and alienation among the lower and middle classes of
Karachi.
   ``We are the new phenonmenon,' Hussain said in an interview at
his headquarters. ``We are the new revolution.''
   The ``great leader,'' as he is known, is a charismatic man famed
in the cities of Sind province as a stirring speaker. Hussain also
is known for the sunglasses he always wears, opulently ringed
fingers and volcanic temper.
   His main weapon is the ability to shut down Karachi, which has
more than 8 million people and is Pakistan's economic center.
   He ordered a citywide strike Feb. 7. Scores of people were
killed and hundreds injured in street battles between his
supporters, rival political group and police.
   ``We represent the oppressed and suppressed masses,'' he said.
``We work only for their interests.''
   Hussain leads the Mohajir Quaim Movement. Mohajirs immigrated
from predominantly Hindu India to Moslem Pakistan after 1947, when
the British turned the subcontinent into two nations and granted
them independence.
   The Mohajir movement claims its people are discriminated against
by Sindhis, the majority in Sind province. Sindhis dominate the
provincial assembly and hold most of the top government jobs.
   Mohajirs generally are better educated than the Sindhis, and
many feel they have been denied opportunities to advance.
   ``I give expression to my people's feelings,'' Hussain said. ``I
know what they want.''
   A Clint Eastwood classic, ``The Outlaw Josie Wales,'' played on
a videocassette recorder behind him. Hussian fingered a huge yellow
sapphire on his middle finger.
   Like many leaders of ethnic political movements, Hussain does
not follow a strict ideology.
   ``We are not socialists or capitalists,'' he said. ``We believe
in practicalism and realism.'' He did not elaborate.
   His well-armed men are known as ``the black shirts of Karachi,''
testimony to the strict discipline imposed by his lieutenants.
Western diplomats estimate Hussain has about 8,000 men under arms
in Karachi and 4,000 more in Hyderabad, Sind's second largest city.
   The movement's headquarters dominates the Azizabad section of
Karachi, a lower middle class area of cement block houses and
serpentine alleys. Hussain's bodyguards, armed with automatic
rifles, stand at the huge steel gates.
   Hussain is the son of a laborer and dropped out of college in
the early 1980s to be a full-time political organizer.
   He allied himself with the Pakistan Peoples Party of Benazir
Bhutto duirng the November 1988 election campaign, supplying the
future prime minister with important votes, but Ms. Bhutto's party
generally ignored Mohajir interests after winning.
   Late last year, Hussain joined the opposition. In November, Ms.
Bhutto barely defeated a no-confidence motion in the National
Assembly, because the Mohajir movement's 14 members voted against
her.

   Charmaine Neville isn't bitter, but she
admits she hasn't forgotten those bad old days before her father
and uncles were famous, when her family was broken up and she was
fighting for survival in one foster home after another.
   ``Being a Neville is great now. But it was a hard trip getting
here for the Neville Brothers, the Neville nieces and nephews and
especially this Neville. I think one reason our music is so
important to all of us is because we had such a hard, hard time
hanging on to it,'' she said.
   Long before the Neville Brothers became Grammy winners, long
before Aaron Neville teamed up with Linda Ronstadt, long before
Charmaine began working clubs and making movies and commercials,
the family was poor and scattered.
   Neville, 34, doesn't remember meeting her father, Charles
Neville of the Neville Brothers, until she was about 5 years old.
From the time she was 2 until she was 12, she spent her life in a
series of foster homes.
   ``I was abused just about every way you can be during that time
_ sexually, mentally, physically,'' she said. ``I was bitter for a
long time. A very long time. I'm not anymore. I know now my parents
couldn't help it. They were young, they didn't have any money or
any way to take care of us.''
   In those days the Neville Brothers were scratching for gigs and
singing for next to nothing.
   ``They were young and inexperienced. Getting known outside of
New Orleans wasn't easy then. It's still not, but it's easier now
than it was them,'' she said.
   Little by little, the Neville family came back together. She met
one of her four sisters in school, another when they took the same
bus to her aunt's house and arrived together. Her four brothers
turned up over the years. As a teen-ager she also got to know her
father and uncles.
   ``I adore my father. Always did. I love my family, including my
last set of foster parents and all 52 of my foster sisters and 48
of my foster brothers. Now that we're back together it's OK,''
Neville said.
   Through it all, music was a part of her life and her family, she
said.
   ``I'd always sung in the church choir. My family always made
music together. I didn't really get serious about it until I was
about 17, though,'' Neville said.
   ``My dad hurt my feelings. We had been playing in New York when
he said, `Call me when you get serious about your music _ because
music is very serious to me and you're not being serious about it.'
''
   That's when she went to work, learning to read music, learning
to control her voice, learning to put her own mark on a song, she
said.
   ``Up until then I just opened my mouth and sang,'' Neville said.
   Now she jumps on stage in a swirl of motion and music. Hands
clap, hips sway, long, slim fingers pop, the mass of thin braids
whip back and forth.
   ``I don't like to classify my singing,'' Neville said. ``If I
say I'm a jazz singer then people ask why I do pop, or rock or
country and western, and I do all of those. I prefer to think of
each song as a little one-act play. I think of myself as an
entertainer and not just a singer.''
   Like the Neville Brothers, Neville's musical blend of New
Orleans rhythms mixes in jazz, Cajun, rock and old time blues.
Particularly popular with audiences is her impersonation of Louis
Armstrong.
   ``It's really not that hard,'' she said of the gravel-voiced
``Satchmo'' she does for several numbers. ``It's just like singing
falsetto, really. It started as a joke; someone asked me if I could
do Louis Armstrong and now people request it all the time.''
   Her music is different from that of the Neville Brothers but it
is a product of their teaching, she said.
   From Aaron she learned voice control.
   ``He's just phenomenal _ his range, the things he can do. He
really showed me how to use my voice and get more from it,'' she
said.
   From Cyril she learned her stage presence.
   ``He's the wild Neville Brother. He taught me to not just stand
there but to open up and have fun with the audience,'' she said.
   From Art she learned music.
   ``He showed me the parts of music that you can use when you know
what you're doing. How to take it apart and put it together
again,'' she said.
   And from Charles she learned to work.
   ``Dad's the coolest of the Neville Brothers. He's the one who
just stands there on stage. But he's also the one who showed me how
much work you have to do to be that cool.''
   Neville works about 360 days a year, mostly in clubs, although
she is a regular at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival and
has made numerous commercials and appeared in several movies and at
least one television pilot.
   In June she will perform in Moscow, in July she'll be in Paris,
in the fall she hopes to return to Milan, Italy.
   She doesn't often work with her famous family these days, she
said.
   ``We've all gotten too busy now. It seems like we are always
passing each other in airports. When we do get together it's a
trip. I was in a club called Delta 88 in New York and Dad and Uncle
Aaron and Uncle Arty came in. We really tore up the club. It was
great,'' she said.
   With her own career building, and the sudden interest in New
Orleans artists such as her uncles, Harry Connick Jr. and Dr. John,
Neville said things look great now.
   ``I just hope this isn't a fad like blackened redfish,'' she
said. ``I mean, why now? The music has been here forever. People in
the rest of the world may not know about New Orleans music but
they're about to get lessons. I just want to be one of the
teachers.''

   Stephanie Vaughn would like to point out that
her short stories are fiction: She made up the good parts.
   Her real father would have never walked on a frozen pond in the
middle of the night. Her grandmother is much nicer than the one
depicted in ``Able, Baker, Charlie, Dog.'' The stories about winter
were written during heat waves; the summer stories came in cold
weather.
   But she really did grow up in a military family. As a teen-ager
the author actually mistook puberty for a fatal disease. And she
was encouraged to speak carefully as a child and be precise, a
style she eventually mastered in written form.
   ``I don't think it's natural for anybody to write,'' insists
Vaughn, whose first collection of stories is called ``Sweet Talk''
(Random House, $16.95).
   ``I think it's natural to speak, and everybody's a storyteller.
You go through your life telling stories. It's hard to write.
Sometimes things come out funny when you don't want them to at that
moment. You're always in danger of destroying your story and
turning it into a joke.''
   The laughter comes in different shades. ``I grew up in the
Army,'' Vaughn writes at the start of ``Kid MacArthur.''
   ``About the only kind of dove I ever saw was a dead dove resting
small-boned upon a dinner plate.'' The theory of the universe
shares space with a local car crash. Premature death is just a few
pages from a sales pitch for the Triple Gripper Vegetable Ripper.
   Having lived around the world as a child, Vaughn is an authority
on the unexpected. She knows writing is as predictable as driving
on an icy road, that a straight line is not the quickest path
between two points.
   ``Dog Heaven'' begins on a New York City sidewalk, a women
dreaming of her dog's death 25 years ago, and ends with the
narrator remembering her childhood at Fort Niagara, saying the
following incantation: ``It was a good day. It was a good day. It
was a good day.''
   ``Yeah, I didn't know it was coming,'' Vaughn said. ``I knew
what was going to happen to the dog but I didn't know how I was
going to get out of the story. You often don't know how you're
going to get out of the story until you get there. I think if
you're not surprised by your writing, you should probably get out
of it.''
   Vaughn was born in Millersburg, Ohio, but also lived in New
York, Oklahoma, Texas, the Philippines and Italy. Writing first
interested her in Australia in the 1970s and she eventually
attended the University of Iowa.
   ``I liked living near cornfields. The town itself (Iowa City)
was just full of writers, full of painters, full of filmmakers.
It's a good place because there are so many other people doing art
and you talk about everything all the time with those people.''
   Vaughn notes that ``Sweet Talk'' is crammed with advice that
isn't always useful. Theories on love, language and disease are all
offered, but only sometimes accepted. In ``Kid MacArthur,'' a boy's
father imposes his own code of honor, advice for a world that only
some experience.
   ``The father is trying to give his son masculine skills,'' the
author said. ``He values language and gossip and he also values
guns. He wants him to be a good marksman and not show his
vulnerabilities when he's out shooting.
   ``I suppose being a good marksman is useful if you're on your
way to Vietnam, but it's not necessarily useful at home.''
   From other writers, Vaughn learned the importance of revision,
sentence rhythms, to sacrifice favorite lines if they don't fit the
story. And the words have to flow, as relaxed as conversation, but
as formally structured as a high school term paper.
   ``You have to invent,'' she said. ``You have to discover, on the
page, a voice. It's very difficult to define what a voice is, but
you know it when it's speaking back to you from the page. You just
hit something that sounds comfortable.''
   Vaughn is now working on a novel, but firmly declines to discuss
it, presenting a theory she wouldn't dare offer to any writer but
herself: Don't discuss a story until it's finished. The surest way
to lose your literary voice is to talk about it.
   ``If you talk about something that's not finished, than you're
giving it a spoken form and therefore there's no reason to give it
a written form. Since I never talk about them, they come out
better. Now, with these short stories, it's almost as if someone
else has written them.''

   Mark Miller of the pop-country band
Sawyer Brown feels reassured when he looks out at concert crowds
and sees people holding up signs with numbers like ``70'' and
``52.''
   The figures represent the number of Sawyer Brown concerts the
fan has attended.
   ``I've seen some in the hundreds, but no 200s yet,'' Miller
said. ``A lot of them are over 50.''
   Miller said the signs are a tradition started soon after the
band began touring. Fans who were proud of the number of concerts
they had attended would hold up a sign.
   Sawyer Brown, which has five members, has developed a legion of
loyal fans since the group won on the syndicated TV show ``Star
Search'' in 1983.
   The fans keep returning to the concerts, as evidenced by the
signs, even though the band has weathered a monumental problem:
little radio air play.
   The group, named after a Nashville street, is too pop for
country music stations and too country for rock 'n' roll stations.
So the five have relied on their frenzied, pulsating, unpredictable
stage shows to maintain their popularity. They ignite audiences by
dancing, jumping and whirling across the stage with supercharged
energy.
   They play upbeat, ``good-time'' music with a driving rhythm and
tight vocals _ all set off by brightly colored clothing.
   After winning ``Star Search'' and splitting the $100,000 prize
money five ways, the group began recording for Capitol Records a
year later. Shortly after that, they were the opening act at Kenny
Rogers' concerts for 1{ years, performing live for millions.
   The Nashville-based band has had hit records along the way,
including ``Step That Step,'' ``The Race Is On,'' ``Shakin''' and
``Leona.'' They have released six albums, including the current
``The Boys Are Back.''
   Miller, reflecting on the band's career, said winning ``Star
Search'' was their breakthrough but the aftermath posed a
formidable challenge.
   ``When you hit that big that quick, people start asking whether
you are a flash in the pan. It was like when the Beach Boys first
came out, some people thought they were a fad. In our case, some
people felt we would be, too, so there were some serious storms we
had to weather.
   ``I think everybody wants you to succeed until you succeed, and
then they start gunning for you. And the guns came out real quick
on us,'' he said.
   ``We are a legitimate act that drew people month after month and
year after year regardless of whether we had a hit record out.
People knew they would see a show as entertainment value.
Basically, we sold our records going door to door, doing 250 dates
a year.''
   He described their concerts as ``intense, very intense. A friend
of mine said it's like being part of an event, like a huge party.
That's what we try to make it.''
   Before winning ``Star Search,'' the group polished its act for
two years as a ``bar band'' at various nightclubs throughout the
country. On good nights they played five sets and on bad nights
they did seven. They often had a ``rowdy table'' contest where the
most uproarious table won a pitcher of beer.
   For Miller, it was a new experience and a valuable one.
   ``I had never been in a bar until I played one,'' he recalled.
   ``You learn that you can be a jukebox or you can demand their
attention by entertaining them.''
   Exposure on a much wider basis came when they joined Rogers on
his concert tours.
   ``When we first got the call, I was so excited,'' Miller said.
``It was a dream come true. I was also scared to death.
   ``I remember the crowd going crazy and on the second night Kenny
came out to see what all the commotion was about. He came in the
dressing room and said we had a job as long as we wanted one.''
   Sawyer Brown is one of the few bands that sign autographs after
every show.
   ``We do them as long as it takes,'' Miller said. ``We feel like
we owe it to the fans as the least we can do. People remember
things like that.''

   In his first motion picture project for
Walt Disney Studios, Bill Murray will star in Touchstone Pictures'
``What About Bob?''
   The new comedy is written by Tom Schulman, who has been
nominated for an Academy Award for ``Dead Poets Society.''
   The movie is scheduled to begin production this summer.
   Murray plays Bob, an excessively neurotic man who resorts to
desperate measures when his psychiatrist takes off on an extended
family vacation.
   ``Bill is a gifted actor and Tom Schulman's script is
tailor-made for his unique comedic talents,'' said David Hoberman,
president of Touchstone Pictures.
   Murray recently made his directorial debut (with co-director
Howard Franklin) on the Warner Bros. caper comedy ``Quick Change,''
co-starring Geena Davis, Jason Robards and Randy Quaid. ``Quick
Change'' is to be released this summer.

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Love At Large'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ever since John Huston, with more than a little help from
Dashiell Hammett, invented the private eye movie with ``The Maltese
Falcon'' in 1941, the genre has thrived in many manifestations.
Raymond Chandler added a cynical note with his Philip Marlowe, best
portrayed by Dick Powell in ``Murder My Sweet.''
   Comic gumshoes have rarely succeeded, though Steve Martin tried
in ``Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid'' and Peter Falk in ``The Cheap
Detective.'' Now comes ``Love at Large,'' which proves that a
private eye satire can be funny and involving at the same time.
   The feat was accomplished by the most improbable of filmmakers,
Alan Rudolph. A disciple of Robert Altman, Rudolph has made films
(``Welcome to L.A.,'' ``Made in Heaven,'' ``The Moderns'') that
seemed quirky, remote and humorless. In making ``Love at Large,''
he seems to be saying, ``OK, I'll make a movie that'll grab 'em.''
   Rudolph's hero Harry Dobbs (Tom Berenger) is a dense Philip
Marlowe with a Columbo voice. Harry can't seem to get anything
right. He agrees to an investigation for a sultry lady of mystery
(Anne Archer), then follows the wrong man.
   Dobbs uncovers an interesting though irrelevant case: a
successful man with two families, one in the city and one on a
ranch. He is followed on his quest by another private eye
(Elizabeth Perkins), hired by his jealous girlfriend (Ann Magnuson).
   The wayward detective finally gets back on track, and the film
reaches a violent though unexpected finale. The plot is rambling
and inconclusive, but the enjoyment comes from the characters, most
of them cast against type.
   Berenger, the demonic sergeant of ``Platoon,'' is a comic
delight with his sandpaper voice and well meaning klutziness.
   Anne Archer, the wronged wife in ``Fatal Attraction,'' plays a
humanoid Jessica Rabbit, a gorgeous parody of a 1940s femme fatale.
Elizabeth Perkins, the sharp executive of ``Big,'' is sympathetic
as Dobbs' fallible partner.
   The strong cast also included Annette O'Toole, Ruby Dee, Neil
Young and Kate Capshaw. Rudolph gives all his actors a chance to
shine.
   Inflation note: Harry Dobbs charges $500 a week retainer plus
expenses. Wouldn't Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe be envious?
   The Orion Picture was produced by David Blocker and is rated R
for language, violence and sexual byplay. Running time: 110 minutes.

   ``Chocolat'' (Orion. VHS-Beta, $79.98. Rated PG-13)
   
   France and Protee have a special relationship. They communicate
spiritually, silently; their imaginations intertwine.
   But they are adrift in a political and social stew: It is the
ebbing days of French rule in Cameroon. France is white. Protee is
her family's black houseboy.
   Their world is shattered when a group of white travelers with
plane problems arrive and become house guests. There is betrayal
and a painful coming of age.
   Isaach de Bankole is excellent as Protee, bringing just the
right reserve to the role. Mireille Perrier is haunting.
   The French movie is directed by Claire Denis. Though her pacing
is sometimes slow, she moves her story with feeling.

   ``An Innocent Man'' (Touchstone. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   What's the story every convict tells? I'm innocent.
   Only this time, it's true. Tom Selleck stars as Jimmie Rainwood,
an ordinary guy who services aircraft, whose ordinary life becomes
a horror show when two corrupt cops frame him for drug dealing in
order to cover up their mistake.
   He, of course, pleads not guilty at his trial, is convicted and
shipped off to the big house where he meets the usual herd of
prison animals. There's the usual prison challenges and violence
seen in just about all jail movies. Only this time, an innocent man
must prove himself in order to survive. He does this by murdering
another prisoner.
   When he's released, he seeks his vengeance.
   ``An Innocent Man,'' directed by Peter Yates who did so well
years ago with ``Bullitt,'' is a good idea and plays just fine as
far as it goes. But it's missing a toughness, an edge _ the drama
and tension that could make it a far more compelling movie.
   The problem, unfortunately, might be Selleck. Although he gives
a fine performance as the wronged citizen, he's simply too nice a
guy. The two cops are predictably sleazy and telegraph their moves.
   But what the movie lacks in excitement, is made up for in its
realistic prison scenes and prison lingo. F. Murray Abraham is a
delight as the prison's respected lifer.
   The video is worth a look.

   ``The Cactus Album'' (Columbia-Def Jam) _ 3rd Bass
   
   Yeeoww! Rap for the new generation.
   On 3rd Bass' ``The Cactus Album,'' there are beats more
effective than Mike Tyson's uppercut, and rapping more fresh than a
daisy.
   But hold on now. 3rd Bass is white. And they leave the Beastie
Boys in the dust. The Beasties come off as a bunch of middle-class
white brats trying to pull one over on the record-buying public.
   However, 3rd Bass' MC Serch (22-year-old Michael Berrin) and
Prime Minister Pete Nice (22-year-old Peter Nash) grew up in the
New York borough of Queens and hung out in all-black housing
projects and city parks, getting bashed around but learning to rap
hard.
   Their debut album is a slammin' mix of vocals, quirky recordings
and sampled music that, like De la Soul's ``3 Feet High and
Rising,'' will have you playing Name That Tune. They take bits from
Pink Floyd's ``Time,'' the '70s hit ``Dream Weaver'' and mutate the
melody from Blood, Sweat and Tears' ``Spinning Wheel.''
   While some rap music is just tedious thump-thumping with
shout-talking vocals, ``The Cactus Album'' shows rap's power to
create post-rock, post-pop, hybrid music.
   This record is a stew cooked in the melting pot of New York,
with a load of ingredients as large as the Empire State Building.
   Words. They got words. Lots of them. And yeah, some of those
words aren't too nice.
   But MC Serch and Pete Nice also have ``wordz of wizdom'' like
``Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black, must've been a white
guy who started all that,'' on ``The Gas Face.''
   On ``Product of the Environment,'' they comment, ``Pushin' a
drug, I can't understand, destroying a life with a buck in the
hand.''
   These boys have fun, too. The album opens with a bit of ``The
Little Rascals'' theme, and closes with Abbott and Costello doing a
scratchin' version of their ``Who's on First?'' routine _ only
they're asking who's on 3rd.
   3rd Bass punches a knockout, dense form of rap that goes way
beyond their peers.

   ``Jim Croce Live: The Final Tour'' (Saja) _ Jim Croce
   
   Nostalgia for the 1970s appears inevitable, so we might as well
learn to deal with it. One simple way would be to avoid ripoffs,
such as the new disc ``Jim Croce Live: The Final Tour.''
   Singer-songwriter Croce died in a plane crash in 1973. This new
live recording doesn't serve his memory at all well, despite Ingrid
Croce's role as executive producer.
   For one thing, the package is cheap. There's one picture of
Croce and no liner notes. There's a whole generation of music
buyers out there who weren't born when Croce died; they should be
told a little about his life and music.
   Basic facts are ignored. Who played with Croce? Where was the
performance recorded? When? Was this an entire show or just a
portion?
   The 16-cut disc includes an appalling 18 minutes of Croce
talking to the audience. He's mildly amusing, though occasionally
dated: When was the last time you heard jokes about the Maharishi?
   One stretch is remarkably ghoulish. Croce _ apparently months,
weeks or days from dying in a burning plane _ talks about trips on
Allegheny Airlines, which later became USAir. He jokes about a
``white-knuckle flight.''
   The worst thing about the dialogue, of course, is it's much
better to hear Croce sing than talk. Unfortunately, you won't hear
him sing some of his best-known songs, including ``Bad, Bad Leroy
Brown,'' ``Time in a Bottle'' or ``I Got a Name.'' Couldn't a few
minutes of talking be sacrificed?
   A couple of songs could be sacrificed, too. One potential victim
is the dated ``Roller Derby Queen,'' with the 5:28 minutes of
``Roller Derby Queen Dialogue'' preceding it. The lewd limerick
``Ball of Kerrymuir'' is tasteless.
   ``Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)'' and the poignant
``These Dreams,'' which bookend the disc, are Croce's best musical
moments. Elsewhere, a lack of balance in the recording _ the voices
too loud and guitars too soft _ is an annoyance.
   With so many well-researched and well-documented reissues coming
out these days, it's disheartening to see such a shabby package.
Vinyl buyers can take heart, though: ``Jim Croce Live: The Final
Tour'' is available only on cassette and compact disc.

<TEXT>
   In the late 1950s, George Stevens decided to
make a movie version of the Tony award-winning play ``The Diary of
Anne Frank,'' based on the stirring journal of a teen-ager's loss
of innocence and the destruction and horror wrought by the
Holocaust.
   Only one actress, he thought, could breath life into young Anne
Frank's words of hope and self-knowledge: Audrey Hepburn.
   She was a fresh face for American audiences and had captured the
best actress Academy Award for her 1953 Hollywood debut in William
Wyler's ``Roman Holiday.'' She was fragile, yet strong; innocent,
yet worldly; elfin, childlike, sensual and quietly elegant. She was
the indestructible waif.
   Like Anne, she had lived in the Netherlands during the Nazi
occupation. Hepburn had first read the diary in 1946 when she was
16. ``I was deeply affected by it when I first read it,'' she
recalled in a recent interview. ``It paralleled so much what I had
experienced.
   ``Anne Frank and I were the same age, and she recorded
everything she had heard about, which I had experienced on the
outside, plus her own deep feelings, the development of her
adolescence and her relationship with her parents and her feelings
about life, all of which were very typical of a sensitive girl of
that age.''
   Hepburn reread the diary when Stevens made his offer. It brought
back a flood of memories, and she turned him down. The part went to
Millie Perkins.
   ``I was so destroyed by it again that I said I couldn't deal
with it,'' Hepburn said. ``I suppose, it's very hard to explain.
It's a little bit as if this had happened to my sister. I couldn't
play my sister's life. It's too close, and in a way, she was a
sister soul perhaps. I could not exploit for what I considered
entertainment, the suffering and experience she had gone through.''
   Anne Frank died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945
after contracting typhoid fever. Today, she would be 60 _ like
Audrey Hepburn.
   And today, Hepburn is finally ready to read Anne's words. She
will do so on Sunday at the world premiere performance of Michael
Tilson Thomas' musical based on ``The Diary of Anne Frank.'' The
concert is a special benefit for UNICEF, for which Hepburn is the
goodwill ambassador.
   ``Now I'm very happy to read her words,'' Hepburn said from her
home in Switzerland. ``I'm thrilled to do so because I think it's
something very important. ... They're very deep and they're pure
becuase she was a child and she wrote them from her heart, and I
think it's a lovely opportunity to relay her thoughts once again,
her spirit.
   ``Anne Frank's words _ she herself a child _ will be used to
bring solace to children, it would have made her very happy.''
   Since leaving the film business about two decades ago to
concentrate on being a mother to her two sons, Sean, now 29, and
Luca, 20, Hepburn has spent some of her time working with UNICEF.
   The international organization didn't suddenly float into
Hepburn's life because she needed some sort of social cause. As for
politics, she describes herself as ``totally unpolitical.''
   ``I've never known anything about politics,'' she said. ``I just
care terribly because I saw so much as a child about suffering and
the suffering of children.''
   Rather, she first encountered the organization that would grow
into UNICEF shortly after the Germans surrendered, when she and
others who had survived the harsh winter months of 1944-45 with
little food and inadequate clothing received relief.
   ``I somehow feel I've been connected with UNICEF all my life,''
she said. ``They were there right after liberation, so I benefitted
from their help, like millions of other children. Then over the
years, I've been constantly in contact for some reason or another.''
   Hepburn was born in Belgium. Her parents divorced when she was 6
and she went to live with her mother, the baroness Ella van
Heemstra, in Holland. As a youngster, she studied ballet. She later
went to London to pursue dance and eventually found herself in
British films (``Lavender Hill Mob,'' ``Young Wives' Tales'').
   She first got the attention of Broadway and Hollywood while
filming ``Monte Carlo Baby'' at the Hotel de Paris in Monaco. She
was spotted by the French writer Colette who thought she would make
an excellent ``Gigi'' for the play based on her novel. Hepburn, an
unknown, opened as the lead at the Fulton Theater in November 1951.
   She jumped from Broadway to star in ``Roman Holiday'' with
Gregory Peck.
   Hepburn quietly glided out of film work in the late '60s after
``Wait Until Dark'' and ``Two for the Road.'' She reappeared with
Sean Connery as the aging Robin Hood and his maiden in ``Robin and
Marian'' in 1976 and shocked fans with her graying hair and hint of
wrinkles. She appeared in the thriller ``Bloodline'' with its
all-star cast in 1979 and made a TV movie with Robert Wagner in
1987. Then, late last year, she popped up on the screen in Steven
Spielberg's ``Always'' as an angel guide.
   ```Always' was such a surprise,'' she said. ``I got a divine
phone call from Steven Spielberg, and I was just thrilled to death.
It took me one second to decide. It was such wonderful fun and
therapy and Montana was so beautiful. ... It was a marvelous
experience.''
   And yes, she would definitely do another movie _ if it's Steven
Spielberg.
   Holly Golightly meets E.T.?
   Holly in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was one of Hepburn's most
memorable roles. She was endearing, extreme and elegant. All of
Hepburn's characters mirrored the actress herself: There was always
a humanity and quiet grace, and bursts of elfin charm.
   In ``Sabrina'' with Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, she was
charming as the chauffeur's daughter who falls in love with the
wealthy playboy. In ``The Nun's Story,'' she demonstrated her
talent for drama. And she matched Albert Finney line for line as
the young lovers who become a troubled married couple in ``Two for
the Road.''
   But Hepburn never thought of herself as a star or a talented
artist.
   ``I never had this huge talent or a great technique,'' she said.
``But somehow I may have had something that contributed ... this
extraordinary run of fortune.
   ``I don't know, it's something about personality ... an enormous
joy perhaps that I had in doing what I was doing and being able to
convey that, and a sort of affection for what I was doing, and for
the people around me, and the story I was doing, and the parts I
was playing and the people who would be watching me.
   ``It was all sort of a big love affair.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Venezuelan Art Boom</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>

   Venezuelan artists once labored in
obscurity, gaining recognition only after their deaths.
   Today, however, such artists as Reveron, an eccentric who lived
in a shack he built along the Venezuelan coast, Francisco Narvaez,
whose monumental sculptures grace many public parks and plazas, the
kineticist Jesus Soto and abstract sculptor Marisol are attracting
investors from around the world.
   Venezuelan and Latin American art is hotter now than it has ever
been. Last November, world records were set in auctions of Latin
American art at the two largest art auction houses in New York.
Christie's sold 262 works for an unprecedented total of $9.5
million, while sales at Sotheby's netted $5.5 million.
   ``I can definitely say there is a boom in Venezuelan art,'' said
Axel Stein, Sotheby House representative in Venezuela and Colombia.
   ``Before 1975, people only talked about Latin American art. We
thought a painting by Reveron, for example, `Mujer con Mantilla,'
would fetch about $100,000, and it sold for $300,000 in November.
There is a growing interest on the part of informed collectors.''
   Artists in Venezuela have usually been relegated to a second
tier on the international scale, with only a few breaking into the
ranks of the greats.
   But all that is changing, as differences in world culture
rapidly shrink and art work becomes a commodity, a calculated
gamble on its future financial worth.
   One person who has done her share in promoting world art within
Venezuela and Venezuelan art abroad is Sofia Imber, founder of the
Caracas Museum of Contemporary Art.
   The museum, which opened in 1974, has an international
reputation for the quality of its expositions and permanent
collection that includes such artists as Picasso, Braque, Moore,
Herbin, Chagall and Calder.
   ``Nothing is easy. Sometimes I'm amazed when I look back and see
where we've come from,'' Imber said in an interview in her offices
below the museum.
   Besides her museum work, Imber is host of a popular TV talk show
and writes regularly about cultural affairs in Venezuelan
newspapers. She was also married to Carlos Rangel, the conservative
intellectual and writer who died three years ago.
   Imber's interest in art came as an adolescent. She recalled
seeing one of Armando Reveron's paintings on display when she was
about 11 or 12 years old.
   ``In those days he was an unknown. I sat and cried in front of
the painting. I don't remember which one now. It was then I
discovered my vocation _ to work for art,'' she said.
   Imber sees no essential differences between Latin American and
European art. ``The best horses run with the herd of the great
ones. I don't believe in regionalism,'' she said.
   However, one of the problems confronting Latin American artists
is a lack of regional unity, not only in art, but in culture
generally. Just as Latin American economies must integrate in order
to survive in the modern marketplace, Latin American artists must
strive to know each other's work better, she said.
   ``We know less of what happens in Bogota (Colombia) than what
happens in Paris or New York,'' Imber said.
   But contemporary artists are doing much to polish Venezuela's
international art reputation.
   ``It's a good moment for the younger generation, people like
Jesus Soto, Jacobo Borges and Arturo Cruz-Diez,'' she said.
   But contemporary artists still suffer from slow acceptance on
the part of European and North American art lovers.
   ``Sure, there is some chauvinism,'' said Stein. ``But it's just
as difficult for a North American contemporary artist to be
accepted here. There's too much competition. There are many people
trying to break the barriers, but it's hard.''
   Stein said it was important that private foundations, artists
and collectors get together in order to promote contemporary Latin
American art.
   ``The Colombians did an outstanding job promoting their younger
artists in the '70s,'' he said. ``There were many Colombian artists
in New York and Paris. With the help of the government, the
Colombian embassies, businesses and foundations, they tried to
identify artists and move them along. With oil-rich Venezuela, on
the other hand, the tendency was to be satisfied with the internal
market.''
   But local collectors, of which there are a select few in
Venezuela, can also be important in sustaining and promoting local
art, Stein said.
   ``In the '60s and '70s, you could buy young artists' work for
10,000 bolivars (about $2,325 at the exchange rate then). You
couldn't get anything today for less than 200,000 bolivars (about
$4,000 at current exchange rates), but it still might be a good
investment,'' he said.
   One young Venezuelan sculptor, Carlos Mendoza, shares his
contemporaries' enthusiasm.
   ``I think the local market is a good one and it will keep
growing, despite the economic crisis we are living through, but I
want to break through internationally as soon as I can. It doesn't
happen overnight, but people are buying more art, not just because
of their taste, but because they see it as an investment,'' said
Mendoza, who is installing a piece of sculpture outside a Caracas
Metro station.

   A Greyhound bus in Connecticut was hit by sniper fire and the
chairman of the strike-crippled bus line offered a $25,000 reward
for information about a weekend shooting in Florida that injured
eight passengers.
   No one was injured in the Connecticut shooting Monday, which
occurred as a New York-to-Boston Greyhound bus headed into Hartford
with 19 passengers. Passengers reported hearing a small pop that
some thought was a blown tire.
   The union, which represents 6,300 drivers and more than 3,000
office and maintenance workers, went on strike March 2. There have
been scattered violent incidents since then.

   The stock market meandered to a modestly higher close Monday in
the slowest session of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average,
which drifted in a narrow range throughout the session, eked out a
gain of 3.38 points to end at 2,686.71.
   The dollar rose against most major currencies. Bond prices were
mixed in light trading. Futures prices for frozen pork bellies rose
sharply; grains were mixed, precious metals and energy products
slid lower.

<HEAD>Acquisition of Textile Giant Proves Troublesome for Bill Farley</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   William Farley is seeing his share of troubles as
he puts the finishing stitches on his $3 billion acquisition of
West Point-Pepperell.
   It's been a little more than a year since the Pepperell board
agreed to his $58-a-share offer for the Georgia-based maker of such
popular products as Martex and Lady Pepperell sheets and towels.
   But Farley has faced multiple obstacles to acquiring the last 5
percent of the textile giant and unloading some of Pepperell's
assets to reduce the debt he incurred in the takeover.
   Because of Farley's failure so far to complete the financing,
two major credit rating agencies have downgraded the debt of Farley
Inc. and Pepperell.
   And there is speculation that Farley may be forced to sell Fruit
of the Loom, one of the crown jewels of his corporate empire, to
cut debt further.
   Farley's troubles have come amid _ and some say have reflected _
the waning of the junk bond and debt-financed takeover era in which
he and others prospered during the 1980s.
   ``With the retrospective of 12 months, it is clear he paid too
much for West Point,'' said Kay C. Norwood, a textile industry
analyst with Interstate-Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C.
``Certainly, he paid way too much.''
   Ms. Norwood, however, isn't ruling out the chance that Farley, a
former encyclopedia salesman who has talked about running for
president, will come out on top. And she is not alone in that view.
   Things looked better for Farley last year when he outlasted
then-Chairman Joseph L. Lanier Jr. in a four-month battle for
control of Pepperell.
   Despite an undercurrent of anxiety over possible mass layoffs at
local mills, West Point, Ga., and the surrounding communities near
the Alabama line welcomed the man who during the takeover battle
had been derided as a carpetbagger out to get a company that for
generations was locally run.
   ``Welcome to a New Beginning. Farley Town, USA,'' read a banner
hung at the entrance of a West Point bank at the time.
   Farley paid $1.6 billion in April 1989 for 95 percent of
Pepperell, assuming more than $1 billion in debt in the process.
   His problems with debt magnified his problems financing the
buyout, said Joseph E. McCann, an associate professor at Emory
University's Business School in Atlanta.
   ``So you've got a situation where you don't have just one deal.
You've got to make a lot of deals to consummate (the original)
one,'' McCann added. ``The more complex the deals, the easier it is
to fall apart.
   ``He needed to do a `one-stop-shopping' financial transaction,
and he did not.''
   Contributing to Farley's problems was his association with
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which raised $905 million for the
acquisition through the sale of junk bonds. Since Drexel's recent
bankruptcy court filing, Farley has hired new investment bankers to
restructure the Pepperell financing.
   Farley also has a $1.03 billion bridge loan, which has been
extended through the end of this month.
   The proposed sale of three of Pepperell's Cluett Peabody &amp; Co.
divisions to Bidermann Industries USA, a subsidiary of a French
company, was considered crucial to cutting Farley's takeover debt.
But the deal, announced in October, has not been closed and the
sale price reportedly has dropped to $430 million from the original
$600 million.
   Farley officials did not return telephone calls.
   Ms. Norwood said she thinks Farley will complete the Pepperell
deal, but he may not like the results.
   ``Some divisions are going to be sold at prices he doesn't
like,'' she said. ``The banks are going to want the sales very
quickly. ... The banks don't want to end up owning a textile
company.''
   Despite his predicament with the buyout, Farley has gotten high
marks for some of the things he's done as Pepperell chairman.
   Many of Lanier's executive allies left with the former chairman.
Farley has hired the respected Charles A. Lieppe, a veteran
executive with Procter &amp; Gamble Co., as Pepperell's new president
and chief operating officer.
   Also, Pepperell has pruned the executive suites and added 800
people at five plants in the past year. More than $80 million has
been invested in plant improvements.

<TEXT>
   NL Industries Inc. Chairman Harold Simmons,
waging a proxy battle for control of the Lockheed Corp. board,
contends he can increase the firm's returns by concentrating on its
core defense and aerospace businesses.
   Simmons, the company's largest stockholder with a 19 percent
stake, told securities analysts Monday that if he wins control of
the Lockheed board at the firm's annual meeting March 29, he also
would force the company's smaller divisions to turn an acceptable
level of profits.
   The Dallas-based investor shrugged off reminders that many proxy
fights by prominent takeover specialists have ended in failure,
calling himself a manager, not a corporate raider. Simmons also has
a $1.1 billion takeover bid outstanding for Georgia Gulf Corp.
   Simmons pointed to his successes with NL and other companies as
proof he is qualified to run _ and improve _ Lockheed. However, he
had no answers about how he would go about redeploying Lockheed's
assets and reducing its overhead, and said he would not know until
after he had control of the board.
   ``You don't snap your fingers overnight,'' he said.
   Simmons and NL President J. Landis Martin criticized Lockheed
management for placing more than $2 billion in assets in its
technology services and electronic systems divisions that produce
little profit.
   They portrayed Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep as unable to
get a handle on the firm's problems and use its assets properly.
   Tellep, hearing a description of the analysts' meeting,
responded that the assessment ``reflects a lack of understanding of
Lockheed'' and said Simmons and Martin were stating Lockheed's
record ``in a way to make their case.''
   Martin criticized Tellep for calling Lockheed's 1989 performance
_ when the company's earnings fell to $2 million from $624 million
in 1988 _ the results of a transitional year as the company took a
number of large write-downs.
   Even without the writedowns, which included $300 million for
unexpected design changes on a Navy plane, Lockheed's earnings were
down except for its missile and aerospace business, Martin said.
   Martin also disputed a statement by Tellep that Lockheed's stock
price, which closed Monday at $35.50 a share on the New York Stock
Exchange, reflected an industry-wide malaise.
   During the session with analysts, Martin said Lockheed sales
growth was running behind other defense contractors and that the
firm's stock price, which is down from a high of $54.75 over the
past year, was running behind the Standard &amp; Poor's index of
defense and aerospace firms.
   Analysts showed some skepticism of NL's arguments. One analyst,
noting that the Standard &amp; Poor's index includes the atypical
performance of Boeing Co., said Lockheed is running on a par with
other defense contractors, including Northrop Corp.
   Others pressed Simmons and Martin for more specifics on how they
would accomplish their goals if they won their fight.
   Martin called the company's 1988 restructuring plan a failure,
saying Lockheed has been unable to complete the planned sale of
four of its non-core businesses, has not disposed of the real
estate it wanted to sell and suspended its stock buyback plan.
   Tellep responded in a telephone interview that after selling
three divisions, Lockheed withdrew its Calcomp unit when it did not
receive fair offers. Now, however, the division ``has more value at
present time retained as part of Lockheed'' and is returning to
profitablity, Tellep said.
   The real estate sales have not been completed because of
environmental concerns, and Lockheed suspended its stock buyback in
response to Simmons' stock purchases, Tellep said.

<HEAD>Bank Of New England's New Chairman Plans For Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new chairman of Bank of New England Corp. says
he will cut the work force, sell off more assets and consider
selling subsidiaries as part of his rescue plan for the troubled
bank.
   But Lawrence K. Fish offered few specifics Monday about his
blueprint for change, except to say the bank, now valued at $25
billion, would be significantly smaller when he gets through with
it.
   ``In time, I hope we'll be thought of by how good we are, not
how big we are,'' Fish said. ``But that will take time. Larry Fish
can't make all of this happen in weeks or months.''
   On Friday, Fish, a former Bank of Boston executive, was named
chairman and chief executive officer of the bank holding company
and its Boston-based subsidiary. He replaces Walter J. Connolly
Jr., who was ousted this year after the bank suffered massive
losses, mostly in real estate lending.
   Analysts have largely approved of Fish's appointment, citing his
aggressive image and his management experience, which includes 15
years with the Bank of Boston. He spent last year as president and
chief operating officer at Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   But Fish begins his new job hampered by the troubles at Bank of
New England, which last year was the region's second-largest bank.
Federal consent orders have restricted how the bank can do
business, and the bank has struggled under huge debt and a flood of
outgoing depositors.
   Fish said his priority is to complete the planned sale of $6
billion in assets.
   He said the bank was in the process of selling its home equity
lines for over $1 billion. The bank also is selling its lease
assets and other commercial lending assets.
   The sale of the bank's affiliates in Maine and Rhode Island is
also being considered. There are no immediate plans to sell the
Connecticut Bank and Trust Co., which Fish called a ``part of the
core franchise.''
   Fish said personnel cutbacks were inevitable, although he said
he did not know how many layoffs would be necessary.
   Last month, the Bank of New England announced its 1989 losses
were $1.11 billion. Non-performing assets are estimated at more
than $2 billion. The bank has also lost some $5 billion in deposits
in recent months, but Fish said the bank still retained about 98
percent of its depositors.
   The losses in deposits have forced the bank to borrow an
estimated $1 billion-plus from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
   Many of the bank's troubles stem from real estate loans were
made during the region's construction boom in the 1980s and turned
sour when the market softened.
   The federal consent orders, which cover the bank holding company
and its Boston-based affiliate, require the bank to tighten lending
practices as well as get federal approval to declare stock
dividends and conduct financial transactions with its subsidiaries.
   Fixing the bank may not be wholly under Fish's control, however,
said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc.
   ``It depends on how many loans go bad,'' Cassidy said. ``Each
step down the economic ladder we go down as a region, more and more
loans go bad, and Bank of New England does not have the room or the
flexibility to withstand continued decline in their loan
portfolio.''

<HEAD>NYNEX Asks FCC To Dismiss Record Fines and Refunds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NYNEX Corp. has asked the Federal
Communications Commission to throw out more than $36 million in
fines and refunds to be paid by two subsidiaries because they did
not pass along to ratepayers the inflated cost of equipment.
   In legal papers filed Monday, NYNEX said telephone ratepayers
were not overcharged as a result of transactions between Materiel
Enterprises Co., an unregulated NYNEX affiliate, and New York
Telephone Co. and New England Telephone and Telegraph Co.
   Last month, the FCC levied fines totaling $1.4 million against
New York Telephone and New England Telephone and Telegraph and
ordered them to refund about $35 million to customers.
   The fines were the largest federal penalty ever imposed on a
telephone company and involved $118.5 million in alleged
overcharges made to the two subsidiaries by Material Enterprises,
which was established in 1983 to provide equipment and services to
the two phone companies.
   But NYNEX said the prices paid to Materiel were generally lower
than the phone companies would have paid in the open market.
   Plus, the telephone companies were not required to buy from
Materiel, and spent less than half their purchasing dollars with
it, NYNEX said.
   NYNEX also said it followed FCC accounting practices regarding
how telephone companies recorded purchases from affiliates.
   ``Prior to 1988, the only requirement was that carriers be able
to demonstrate, if requested to do so in a ratemaking proceeding,
that affiliate transaction charges were reasonable,'' NYNEX wrote
in its response to the FCC. ``The NYNEX telephone companies have
always been prepared to do this.''
   The FCC had no immediate reaction, said spokeswoman Maureen
Peratino.
   The commission will review NYNEX's response and issue a further
order, which could uphold, reduce or do away with the fines, she
said. NYNEX, if it is still dissatisfided, may seek court review,
she added.
   The FCC said the three companies engaged in a series of
transactions from 1984 to 1988 designed to increase the overall
profits of NYNEX at customer expense.
   The commission conducted an audit which found that New York
Telephone and New England Telephone purchased supplies and
equipment from Materiel at prices that were inflated by $118.5
million. Approximately $35 million of these extra costs were passed
along to interstate customers, the FCC said.
   But on Monday, NYNEX said its subsidiaries earned some $350
million less than they were authorized under applicable federal
tariffs.
   ``Thus interstate ratepayers have suffered no overcharges as a
result of the (Materiel) transactions,'' NYNEX said.
   Thus, the refunds can only be viewed as further penalties, said
Morrison DeS. Webb, NYNEX's vice president for government affairs.

   Walt Disney Co. hopes to use its talent
for enchantment by turning 4,000 acres of swampland and cow
pastures in Central Florida into the planned community of adult
dreams.
   The giant entertainment and theme park company unveiled plans
Monday to build a massive upscale shopping mall, office complexes
and thousands of single-family homes and apartments as part of a
development project that could take the next 25 years to complete.
   Outlining the company's plans at an annual public meeting,
Disney Attractions President Dick Nunis said the project would be
as ``new and innovative as the opening of Disneyland and Walt
Disney World,'' adding that construction could be under way within
five years.
   The development, which would be Disney's first on property it
owns in Osceola County, is located about halfway between downtown
Orlando and Tampa and is surrounded by 6,000 acres of greenbelt,
Nunis said.
   Details, however, were sketchy. The mall, expected to be Central
Florida's largest at about 1.5 million square feet, would house
exclusive department and specialty stores.
   But the number of housing units and the amount of commercial
office space to be developed were not disclosed.
   County officials said last week that Disney told them it plans
to build up to 6,000 middle-income and executive-type houses with a
starting price of $90,000.
   But Nunis said, ``I don't have a crystal ball that those other
guys do.'' He also declined to comment on reports of office space
totaling 7 million square feet _ the equivalent of ten 35-story
buildings.
   In addition to that space, local officials said they were told
the plans include more than a million square feet of
light-industrial office and manufacturing space, one or two golf
courses and recreation areas.
   The property would be de-annexed from Disney's 27,400-acre
resort in Central Florida and turned over to Osceola County, which
would be a partner in its development, Nunis told an audience of
government officials, businessmen and local residents.
   That way Disney would pay _ for the first time _ county impact
fees for water, sewers, roads and other services. So far all Disney
development has been controlled by the company's own Reedy Creek
Improvement District, a special district created by the 1969
Florida Legislature that gives the company much autonomy over its
acreage.
   Disney has been criticized by local government officials, who
contend the company's property taxes are not enough to pay for the
impact it is having on mushrooming growth surrounding its theme
parks, hotels and resort sites.
   Nunis figures a regional impact review would take about a year
and a half. After that, ``We will make an announcement on
groundbreaking and proceed from there.''
   Most county officials were enthusiastic when they first heard of
the plans last week.
   ``This allows us to plan for development now, instead of 20
years from now ... And to be sure that we can pay for the services
that are going to be needed,'' said County Commissioner Jim Swan.
   Nunis also said the project would have plenty of room for ``a
multi-modal transportation station, that can include a high-speed
train planned by the state, and other forms of transportation.''
   He said Disney was a strong supporter of higher gas taxes and
tolls to pay for Florida roads and said he did not believe that
this would hurt tourism.

   Japan's most powerful business group on Tuesday
echoed Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's call for sweeping Japanese
economic reforms, as U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher
arrived in Tokyo for trade talks.
   Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry reported Japan's overall trade
surplus fell to $5 billion in February, down from $7.23 billion a
year ago _ the 10th straight monthly decline.
   Japan's surplus with the United States fell to $2.97 billion
from $4.15 billion a year earlier, it said.
   The Federation of Economic Organizations, which represents
Japan's largest corporations in a wide range of industries, said it
suported Kaifu's efforts to meet U.S. demands for economic reforms
aimed at reducing the $49 billion overall U.S. trade deficit with
Japan.
   ``It is necessary to tackle (these reforms) to the extent that
they constructively aid the sound development of the economies in
both countries,'' the group, known as Keidanren, said in a
statement.
   Keidanren officials said the annoucement reflected the opinion
of the group's entire membership.
   As Mosbacher arrived with other top Commerce Department
officials for talks on trade disputes, a consensus of support for
structural reforms aimed at reducing the trade imbalance appeared
to be building.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and Minister of International Trade and Industry Kabun
Muto said the changes being discussed in trade talks called the
Structural Impediments Initiative were Japan's most important
political task.
   ``We should realize that this issue amounts to crisis management
in Japan-U.S. ties. Discontent within the U.S. Congress is surging
and is on the verge of explosion,'' Nakayama said.
   Both U.S. and Japanese officials agree that the trade imbalance
is gradually falling, but Washington faces election-year pressures
from Congress and is seeking faster progress in reducing its
deficit with Japan.
   Mosbacher, who traveled to Tokyo at the request of President
Bush, was to meet with Kaifu, other government officials, and
industry leaders to discuss specific trade issues and promote U.S.
exports and investment in Japan before returning to Washington
Friday.
   Kaifu is struggling to show substantive progress in promised
economic reforms before early April.

<TEXT>
   Oil Minister Mana Saeed
al-Otaiba called Tuesday for maintaining OPEC's current
$18-a-barrel reference price.
   ``Current oil prices are now fluctuating between $18 and $20 and
that is the ideal level I myself like to see,'' the United Arab
Emirates minister told an oil seminar in Abu Dhabi.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which the
U.A.E. is a member, has been adjusting production ceilings for its
13 member states to stabilize prices around $18 a 42-gallon barrel.
   Some OPEC member states, led by Iraq, favor an increase of the
reference price to $20. But Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi
also said in a recent interview that the issue was unlikely to come
up at the March 16 OPEC market monitoring committee meeting in
Vienna.
   Otaiba said that fixing price levels at current rates, along
with respecting OPEC's production quota, would give the market the
chance to consolidate and allow OPEC after 1991 to raise prices to
``a very reasonable level,'' Otaiba said.
   The U.A.E., however, is the only country that rejected its daily
quota of 1.095 million barrels for the first half of 1990, and has
pledged to produce at the rate of 2 million barrels per day.
   The cartel's production level of about 23.5 million barrels per
day is above the OPEC target.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC, the British food and
drinks group, confirmed Tuesday that it was selling most of its
breweries to Elders IXL Ltd. and that the two companies would
jointly operate about 5,000 pubs.
   The deal will make Australia-based Elders Britain's second
largest brewer after Bass PLC.
   Elders, the world's fourth largest brewer and best known for its
Fosters beer brand, disclosed Friday that it had reached an
``understanding'' with Grand Met and that an announcement was due
shortly.
   The company also had announced it was selling or spinning off
its agribusiness, finance, natural resources and other interests to
focus on its brewing business.
   Elders, through its British unit Courage Holdings PLC, is to pay
$586 million for four Grand Met breweries.
   Elders is also due to obtain Grand Met's local brewing and
distribution rights to several non-British brands, including
Carlsberg and Budweiser.
   At the same time, the two companies plan to merge their pub
businesses into a single company, to be called Inntrepreneur
Estates.
   The new company, to be owned equally, will combine Elders' 4,940
pubs and Grand Met's 3,570.
   But Inntrepreneur plans to sell 1,500 Elders pubs to raise $480
million. Another 2,000 pubs will be released from their obligations
to buy beer supplied by the parent companies over the next two
years.
   These moves will drop the number of pubs under Inntrepreneur's
control to 5,000, a level in line with the recently modified
British brewing industry regulations.
   The regulations were changed last year to encourage the
country's biggest brewing groups to focus on one side of the
industry or the other.
   Grand Met has said it wanted to sell its brewing business to
concentrate on beer retailing.
   The company, which owns Pillsbury Co. of the United States, said
its strengths lie in the sale of branded food, drinks and retail
goods internationally.

<TEXT>
   Retail sales fell 0.9 percent in February, the
sharpest decline since last October, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
$146.5 billion after rising a revised 2.8 percent in January. Sales
dropped off 1.3 percent last October, rose 0.7 percent in November
and then slipped 0.3 percent in December.
   Much of January's strength, which originally was reported to be
a 1.6 percent gain, came from a 9.9 percent jump in automobile
sales after cash rebates and low-interest financing were restored
to attract prospective buyers to dealer showrooms.
   The incentives remained in effect in February, but nevertheless
sales fell 6.0 percent. It was the biggest drop since auto sales
fell 26.5 percent in January 1987. Automobiles represent about 20
percent of retail sales.
   Excluding autos, retail sales rose 0.5 percent in February.
   Retail sales, representing about one-third of the nation's

   Sales of non-durable goods such as food and clothing rose 0.4
percent, down slightly from a 0.5 percent increase in January.
   Gains were posted by department stores, up 2.0 percent; apparel
stores, up 1.6 percent; restaurants and bars, up 1.4 percent, and
grocery stores, up 0.5 percent.
   Declines included gasoline stations and drug stores, both down

   President Bush declared today he is ``prepared
to negotiate'' with congressional Democrats for a comprehensive
package to cut the federal deficit, but insisted he won't abandon
his opposition to tax increases.
   Bush praised Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., for making a ``very
broad proposal'' in coming out with a far-reaching package that
would include both higher taxes and a freeze on Social Security.
   The administration surprised some Democratic lawmakers Monday by
being unexpectedly receptive to the proposal by the Democratic
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
   ``I was, in being receptive, somewhat colored by the way in
which chairman Rostenkowski approached this, the evident good will
on his part to break the ice and move the process forward,'' Bush
said today.
   Congressional Democrats had welcomed the White House's
conciliatory words about Rostenkowski's dramatic deficit reduction
plan while claiming outright administration support is what is
really needed _ something they didn't get from Bush.
   The president told a news conference in the White House briefing
room he would not embrace Rostenkowski's plan for new taxes. ``I'm
not for a tax increase,'' he said, adding that there were many
other parts of the Rostenkowski package he also did not support.
   Asked if he could assure the American people that taxes would
not be raised as part of a deficit-reduction scheme, Bush said:
``I'm only one player. But you know my position. I have no
intention of changing that position.''
   When pressed and asked under what circumstances he might support
a tax increase, the president retorted: ``Too hypothetical. Nice
try.''
   ``I don't want to appear inflexible, but I'm not about to stand
here and give him, Dan, or the Congress, the idea that I'm going to
accept everything in their approach,'' Bush said. Still, he added,
``We're prepared to negotiate.''
   Summing up action on the deficit, Bush noted that Rostenkowski
had proposed his plan, ``we've thrown our idea out'' with the
fiscal 1991 budget, and now ``we'd like the budget leaders on the
Hill to throw theirs out.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater on Monday said, ``We want
to consider this plan.''
   Richard Darman, President Bush's budget director, called the
package ``a courageous initiative, a serious initiative.''
   Speaking on public television's ``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour''
Monday night, Darman said, ``At least there's a whole package here
to start a serious debate with.''
   The White House reaction to the Illinois Democrat's proposal
produced the first glimmer of hope that real progress could be made
this year in shrinking the budget deficit. The Congressional Budget
Office projects the shortfall in fiscal 1991 _ which begins Oct. 1
_ will be $161 billion.
   The administration's words left a hopeful but wary feeling among
Democrats, who have been sensitized to the dangers of leading the
way in advocating tax increases by three consecutive presidential
election defeats.
   Citing Bush's ability to veto Rostenkowski's package and
embarrass Democrats who backed it, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., said, ``Without assurances it will be signed, it will be
difficult to pass.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said two components of Rostenkowski's proposal _ tax
increases and a one-year freeze on cost-of-living increases in
Social Security benefits _ would be ``very huge political
barriers'' to overcome.
   ``Those are very sensitive political issues that would be very
difficult to accomplish within Congress unless there's a clear
recognition that the president will join hands with them on the
issue,'' Panetta said.
   Nonetheless, lawmakers of both parties said they hoped this
could eventually lead to serious efforts to reduce the federal
deficit.
   ``Dan Rostenkowski has correctly challenged Congress, the
administration and the American people to face up to public enemy
No. 1: the federal deficit,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan.
   ``In testimony ... this year, the president's representatives
have suggested that there may be room to negotiate on deficit
reduction,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. ``If that's right, now's the
time for them to come forward.''
   On Sunday, Rostenkowski _ whose committee oversees taxes, Social
Security and other federal benefit programs _ suggested a package
he said would reduce next year's deficit to $106 billion and lead
to a $2 billion surplus by fiscal 1994.
   Over the five years ending in 1995, he said, the plan would save
$512 billion from currently projected deficits.
   ``There are some political mine fields here, there's no question
about it,'' acknowledged Rostenkowski, who appeared on the same
program as Darman.
   Rostenkowski would shrink the defense budget by 3 percent
annually, about 1 percent more than current administration plans.
   He would freeze domestic spending for one year, including
cost-of-living increases for the 39 million recipients of Social
Security, but exempt many benefit programs for the poor.
   The 33 percent income tax rate would be extended to the nation's
600,000 wealthiest taxpayers, who now pay a 28 percent rate.
Federal taxes on cigarettes, beer, wine and gasoline tax would
increase, among other steps.
   Darman conceded that the administration differed with elements
of Rostenkowski's plan, especially its tax increases and Social
Security reductions.
   But he added, ``This plan has only been out here 24 hours now,
and I don't think it's constructive on our part to sit around and
pick at parts.''
   Others weren't reluctant to be negative.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, chided the administration for its ``unserious'' $1.24
trillion budget released in January.
   ``This newfound desire on the part of the White House to
negotiate on the basis of a lone Democrat's call for tax increases
and domestic spending cuts should be taken for what it is:
political opportunism,'' Sasser said.
   Sen. William V. Roth Jr., R-Del., a member of the Finance
Committee, called Rostenkowski's plan ``dead on arrival,'' adding,
``It's just more or less a warmed-over version of what's been
proposed in the past.''

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade declined to $105.89 billion last year, the smallest in five
years, aided by higher merchandise exports and increased foreign
travel, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said that the current account deficit
shrank 16.3 percent from a $126.55 billion imbalance in 1988.
   However, even with the improvement, the current account deficit
remained above $100 billion for the sixth consecutive year. The
1989 total was the lowest since a $104.19 billion deficit in 1984.
   The year ended on a positive note as the October-December
deficit declined to $20.57 billion, down 10.2 percent from the
third quarter, and the smallest quarterly imbalance in almost six
years.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only the
flow of merchandise across borders but also trade in services and
investments.
   The United States ended the 1980s in a far different position
than it began the decade. In 1980, there was a small surplus in the
nation's current account. America was the world's largest creditor
country and its earnings on overseas investments were enough to
offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade.
   However, as Americans transferred billions of dollars into
foreign hands to pay for merchandise imports, the investment
cushion shrank rapidly and disappeared altogether in 1985, when the
United States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   America's debtor position stood at $532.5 billion at the end of
1988 and today's report indicates that it grew to around $630
billion last year. The exact accounting of this figure will not be
released until later in the year.
   The growing foreign ownership in America has triggered a heated
debate over whether America is losing control of its economic
destiny to foreigners.
   Some economists predict that the current account deficit could
actually begin rising again this year, reflecting a higher
dependence on foreign oil and more sluggish sales of U.S. exports.
   That development would spell bad news for the Bush
administration, which is counting on further improvements in trade
to bolster America's flagging industrial sector and add to domestic
economic growth this year.
   For 1989, the merchandise trade portion of the current account
shrank by 11 percent to $113.25 billion as growth in U.S. exports
outpaced a continued rise in imports.
   The surplus in the services and investment category jumped by
41.3 percent to $21.65 billion, up from $15.32 billion, reflecting
increased foreign travel in the United States and higher earnings
by U.S. companies operating abroad.
   The third segment of the current account,U.S. foreign aid and
pension payments to Americans living aboard, added $14.28 billion
to the deficit last year.
   In the fourth quarter, the $20.57 billion deficit compared to a
$22.91 billion deficit in the third quarter.
   The 10.2 percent improvement reflected a slight improvement in
merchandise trade, where the deficit narrowed by 0.9 percent to
$28.81 billion. There was a big 39.2 percent increase in the
surplus in the services and investment category, which climbed to
$12.71 billion.
   This increased reflected in large part a drop in the value of
the dollar during the quarter, which boosted the foreign earnings
of American companies operating abroad when that income was
translated back into dollars. Foreign aid and pension payments were
up 28 percent in the quarter to $4.48 billion.
   Despite the improvement last year and in the fourth quarter in
particular, many economists believe that the U.S. net debtor
position will climb above $1 trillion sometime in the 1990s.
   Analysts fear that this will cause a decline in U.S. living
standards as financing the growing foreign debt burden will make
less money available in this country for productive investment.

<TEXT>
   Saatchi and Saatchi Co. PLC today announced 30
percent salary cuts for founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi and
several other steps designed to help turn around the troubled
British advertising agency.
   Maurice Saatchi, who is chairman of Saatchi's board of
directors, and, Charles Saatchi, a director, will see their annual
salaries cut to about $699,000 from $1 million.
   Other board members are to take a 10 percent cut to help raise
cost-consciousness at the company, Saatchi said at its annual
shareholders meeting.
   Saatchi also announced the appointment of two Americans to its
board of directors, Harvard University business professor Theodore
Levitt and Tom Russell, chairman of Applied Bioscience
International Inc. of New Jersey.
   Saatchi also said it was close to completing the sale of its
major consulting businesses, and announced it agreed to sell the
U.S. agency McCaffrey and McCall to its management for an
undisclosed price.
   Madison Avenue has been speculating about the McCaffrey and
McCall sale for the past several months.
   Saatchi also confirmed its strategy of focusing on its
communications business and disposing of those consulting
businesses, which it has been trying to do for about a year. So
far, its has sold four small firms for $38 million.
   Saatchi said dismantling the communications group, with the
exception of the McCaffrey and McCall sale, would not be in the
interest of shareholders.
   There has been speculation in the British press that Saatchi
might reluctantly sell off chunks, perhaps its U.S. ad agency
Backer and Spielvogel, which it bought in 1986 for $56 million.
   Maurice Saatchi told shareholders, ``This is a difficult time.
In any difficult situation one has a choice: fight or flight. We
are determined to win.''
   Saatchi lost $94 million in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, and
its share price has fallen sharply in recent months.
   Saatchi shares were trading at around $2.30 on London's Stock
Exchange by late Tuesday, down sharply from its 12-month high of
$6.74.
   Analysts blame the company's problems on its expensive
diversification into consulting during the mid-1980s, weak
financial controls and a period of slow growth in the advertising
industry.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat and soybean futures were little changed after initially
following the corn market down amid forecasts for warm, rainy
weather in the Midwest and Great Plains.
   Unseasonably mild weather in the nation's agricultural
midsection is expected to continue into next week, according to the
latest six-to-10-day National Weather Service forecast.
   The weather conditions are considered bearish for the grain
markets but ``overall, the market isn't acting badly,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to \ cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.83} a bushel;
corn futures were unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at $3.82{
a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with March at $2.46 a

<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus fell 30 percent in February
to $5 billion from $7.23 billion a year earlier, the Ministry of
Finance reported Tuesday.
   It was the 10th consecutive month of year-on-year declines in
Japan's trade surplus, but was substantially higher than January's
revised surplus of $338 million.
   Japan's surplus with the United States shrank 28.5 percent to
$2.96 billion in February from $4.14 billion a year earlier, the
ministry said.
   In recent months, higher international oil prices and strong
domestic demand have boosted the value of imports while growing
overseas production by Japanese manufacturers has helped hold back
export growth.
   In February, exports fell 1.9 percent from a year earlier to
$21.9 billion for the fifth consecutive decline, the ministry said.
Imports rose 11.9 percent to $16.9 billion, it said.
   Officials of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
attributed the rise in imports largely to increased purchases of
food products, raw materials and industrial products.
   The decline in Japan's trade surplus with the United States
resulted from a 5.9 percent drop in exports to the United States,
to $7.12 billion, and a 21.4 percent rise in imports, to $4.15
billion, the ministry said.
   Japan's surplus with the European Community edged down to $1.88
billion from $1.89 billion a year earlier.
   Japan measures its trade balance on a customs-clearance basis,
in which freight and insurance costs are included in import figures
but not in exports.

   Prices were narrowly mixed on Wall Street today
as traders again bought blue chip stocks and shied away from the

   The chairman of strike-crippled Greyhound visited hospitalized
passengers, offered a $25,000 reward for information on a sniper
and rode a bus to prove it safe, but early today more bullets hit a
Greyhound bus in Chicago.
   No injuries were reported in today's shooting on Interstate 57
on Chicago's far South Side. A company spokesman said it was the
seventh such incident since a drivers' strike began March 2.
   Greyhound executive Fred G. Currey crisscrossed Florida on
Monday, seeking to calm fears about bus travel after a sniper's
bullet Sunday hit a Greyhound bus operated by a replacement driver
in Jacksonville, Fla., injuring eight passengers.
   President Bush, while answering a question about baseball's
labor dispute, said today that he was reluctant to have the federal
government intervene in collective bargaining matters. He said that
approach was not proper for the baseball talks but ``on some issues
that could well serve to be a prospect.''
   A Labor Department official, however, said there were no plans
for direct government intervention in the Greyhound talks.
   In Chicago, four shots hit the bus and one bullet, believed to
be from a 9mm handgun, was recovered, said Trooper Brian Williams.
The 13 passengers aboard continued their journey on another
Memphis, Tenn.-bound bus.
   Company spokesman George Gravley said it was the third shooting
incident in Chicago since the first day of the strike, when shots
were fired at a bus and a terminal. Other shootings occurred in
Ohio, Arizona, Florida and Connecticut.
   Gravley said there was nothing to connect the the shooting to
the strike, ``but we don't have buses shot at when we're not
negotiating a contract.''
   Gravley said the union has rejected a call from Greyhound
officials ``to join with us in a joint effort to deplore the
violence and restore peace.''
   A union official today said he didn't think strikers were to
blame.
   ``I have told (striking workers) thousands of times that we do
not, will not, and never will condone this kind of violence,'' said
William Pearsall, vice president of the Amalgamated Transit Union's
Local 1303, which represents the Chicago area.
   Currey rode a Greyhound bus from Jacksonville to Orlando, Fla.,
then took a plane to Miami, where he said he was pessimistic about
the chances of a settlement any time soon. The union, representing
6,300 drivers and more than 3,000 office and maintenance workers,
went on strike over pay and job security.
   ``We will not bend or move because of intimidation and
violence,'' said the chairman of America's only nationwide bus
service.
   The strike has been marked by scattered violence, including a
striker crushed to death by a bus operated by a replacement driver
in Redding, Calif. A Greyhound bus heading into Hartford, Conn.,
with 19 passengers was hit by sniper fire Monday. No one was hurt.
   In Jacksonville, passsengers were hit by shrapnel and other
debris. Greyhound officials quickly responded to prevent a public
relations fiasco.
   Currey, Greyhound chairman and chief executive officer, and
Frank Schmeider, its president, flew to Jacksonville early Monday
from Dallas, visiting the three passengers still hospitalized. They
also visited bus riders who were put up by the company in a
Jacksonville hotel overnight.
   One hospitalized passenger, Michael Rogers of Atlanta, was
critical of the company.
   ``I don't think they should run their lines while they're having
a situation like this going on,'' he said. ``Or at least warn the
general public that a situation like that might occur.''
   In Orlando, Currey criticized union leaders for not speaking out
against intimidation. ``Their silence is deafening,'' he said.
   Asked why he rode the bus, he said: ``I took the trip because I
thought it was important for Greyhound people not to be
intimidated.''
   In Washington federal mediators met for three hours Monday for
``an exploratory, informal meeting'' with union officials.
   Jim Power, a spokesman for the Federal Mediation Service, said
the union ``agreed to the possibility of additional meetings with
the mediation service and management to start the collective
bargaining process again.''
   Greyhound, which serves 9,600 U.S. communities, is operating
with replacement drivers and breakaway union members. It said its
number of passengers Sunday amounted to nearly 36 percent of the
same day last year.

   Stock prices finished slightly higher Tuesday on

   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 1.7
points at 2,224.5, above its session low of 2,213.4 and just below
its best level of 2,224.8.
   Volume totaled 317.6 million shares, up from 297.7 million
shares Monday.
   Dealers said volume likely will remain light until after next
Tuesday's release of Britain's next fiscal budget.
   ``Investors are sitting tight and waiting to see what next week
brings,'' said Mike Young, director of European investment strategy
at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
   Recent indicators and industry surveys have painted a mixed
picture of the British economy. Political concerns and their
implications for the pound also have pushed investors to the
sidelines, dealers said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives from small manufacturing companies
expect a sales decline and flat profits this year, according to a
trade group survey released Tuesday.
   The executives, who head firms with 500 or fewer employees, also
anticipate tighter credit and expect to reduce their investment
spending, the National Association of Manufacturers said.
   ``For most members, it appears that sales are starting to move
downward,'' said J. Walter Kisling, chairman of the group's Small
Manufacturer's Forum. Kisling heads Multiplex Company Inc., a
manufacturer of drink dispensing equipment in Ballwin, Mo.
   The survey of 2,531 executives showed that 40 percent expected
flat or declining sales, up from 25 percent who were pessimistic a
year ago. Sixty-two percent anticipated steady or falling profits,
up from 47 percent.
   Sixty percent looked ahead to investing the same or less to
improve their business, up from 44 percent. Fourteen percent said
it was more difficult to obtain financing, up from 8 percent a year
earlier.
   The association also said 72 percent of the executives reported
that less than 5 percent of their companies' revenues came from
exports, a modest improvement from 78 percent last year.
   ``It is clear that small manufacturers aren't entering the
global economy as fast as they ought to be, or as fast as they
can,'' Kisling said.
   Jerry Jasinowski, president of the trade group, called on the
federal government to do more to help small firms export.
   Federal spending on export assistance is ``so modest ... it's
almost off the chart,'' he said.

   India's Supreme Court on Tuesday
approved a government plan to pay interim compensation of $12 per

1984 Bhopal gas disaster.
   The Supreme Court also ruled that the government must pay $44

   The government decided March 5 to pay interim compensation to

   Seeking to get the word out about its latest
promotion _ soft drink cans stuffed with prizes _ Coca-Cola Co.
this week sent 200 reporters the real thing: samples containing $5
bills.
   Newsrooms are frequent recipients of promotional items sent from
companies trying to get a little publicity. But cash from a major
corporation is unusual.
   The ``Magic Summer'' campaign to promote Coca-Cola Classic will
include 750,000 randomly distributed cans, which appear to be
regular cans of Coke but when opened reveal a mechanism holding up
to $200 in cash or a certificate for a variety of other prizes.
   Bob Bertini, a spokesman for Coca-Cola USA, said the company on
Monday sent the reporters cans with $5 bills _ the smallest
denomination in the campaign _ merely to demonstrate the promotion.
   ``We sent it to a very small group of national writers. The
reporters can't write about it without seeing it,'' Bertini said.
   Many news organizations have policies against reporters
receiving gifts of value from news sources.
   Bertini said the company is urging reporters who received the
money to donate it to charity.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid selling prompted by
rainy weather, increased selling of corn by farmers and indications
of adequate soybean oil supplies.
   Mild, stormy weather in the Great Plains and Midwest depressed
prices because the increase in soil moisture should benefit all
crops grown in those regions, analysts said.
   Unseasonably mild weather in the nation's agricultural
midsection is expected to continue into next week, according to a
six-to-10-day forecast issued Monday by the National Weather
Service.
   Farmer selling of corn increased over the weekend, putting
further pressure on futures prices.
   In the soybean complex, a large number of delivery notices were
posted overnight against the expiring March soybean oil contract,
an indication that near-term supplies are adequate to meet demand.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.82 a bushel; corn futures
were 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with March at $2.43} a bushel; oats

<TEXT>
   Asarco Inc. has filed a suit challenging the
proposed sale of Freeport-McMoran Gold Co. to South
African-controlled Minorco SA for $705 million, or $17 a share.
   In its suit filed in New York Supreme Court, Asarco said its
interest in a joint venture with Freeport-McMoran could be violated
by the sale. New York-based Asarco said it is asking the judge to
halt completion of the sale until Asarco's interests have been
fully protected.
   Minorco's tender offer for Freeport-McMoran expires March 23.
   Asarco and Freeport-McMoran each have a 50 percent interest in
the Santa Cruz copper mining research project near Casa Grande,
Ariz. The federal government is funding 75 percent of the project,
which is designed to test a method of extracting copper from a deep
underground formation.
   Freeport-McMoran said Asarco's suit is without merit and will be
vigorously contested.
   On Feb. 20, Freeport-McMoran announced the sale of
Freeport-McMoran Gold Co. to Minorco, which is controlled by De
Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. of South Africa and the associated
Anglo American Corp. Proceeds from the sale would be used to
develop a sulfur discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, the company said.
   Minorco failed last year in a hostile takeover bid for
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a British mining company.
   The proposed sale of Freeport-McMoran Gold is part of a
far-reaching asset sale by its parent, New Orleans-based
Freeport-McMoran. The parent is ridding itself of operations
purchased in the 1980s to pay off debt and to focus the company on
phosphate fertilizers, metals and Gulf of Mexico oil and natural
gas.

<TEXT>
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC took steps Tuesday to
reassure its shareholders that it was working to overcome its
recent financial problems, announcing 30 percent salary cuts for
its founders, naming two Americans to its board and saying it was
close to selling its consulting businesses.
   Maurice Saatchi, who founded the company with his brother
Charles and serves as its chairman, told some 400 shareholders at
their annual meeting, ``This is a difficult time. In any difficult
situation one has a choice: fight or flight. We are determined to
win.''
   Analysts' reaction to the strategy was mixed, with some saying
the company was weak and others saying it was taking proper steps.
   The company has been battered by an expensive diversification
into consulting during the mid-1980s, weak financial controls and a
period of slow growth in the advertising industry. For its fiscal
year ended Sept. 30, Saatchi suffered an after-tax loss of 58.5
million pounds, or $94 million.
   Saatchi already has taken measures to turn itself around,
including naming a new chief executive and finance director and
slashing hundreds of jobs.
   Founders Maurice and Charles Saatchi, who serves as a director,
will see their salaries cut to about 437,000 pounds, or $699,000,
from 625,000 pounds, or $1 million, a year.
   Other members of the boards of directors also are to take 10
percent salary cuts as part of the effort to raise
cost-consciousness at the company, Saatchi said.
   The two Americans appointed to the board are Harvard University
business professor Theodore Levitt and Tom Russell, chairman of
Applied Bioscience International Inc. of East Millstone, N.J.
   Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who replaced Maurice Saatchi as chief
executive at the beginning of the year, said Saatchi's attempts to
sell the Hay Group, its largest consulting division, and CPC
Corporate Planners and Coordinators Inc. were ``well on the way to
completion.''
   Saatchi also is ``in serious negotiations on all of the
consulting companies,'' he said.
   Total proceeds from the sales are expected to be about 80
million pounds to 100 million pounds _ $128 million to $160 million
_ this year, he said.
   Saatchi confirmed its strategy of focusing on its communications
business and disposing of its consulting businesses, which it has
been trying to do for about a year. So far its has sold four small
firms for $38 million.
   Saatchi also said it has reached an agreement to sell the U.S.
ad agency McCaffrey and McCall to the agency's management for an
undisclosed price at an undetermined time. The sale has been
rumored for months.
   In New York, Robert Cherins, McCaffrey's chairman and chief
executive, said ``some issues'' remain to be resolved before the
sale can be completed. He declined to elaborate.
   The agency, based in New York, handles about $300 million a year
in ad billings and employs more than 300 people. It was acquired by
Saatchi in 1983 and its clients include Mercedez-Benz automobiles,
Air Canada, Tiffany jewelry, Bacardi rums and the consumer products
division of Burroughs Wellcome Co.
   Saatchi said dismantling the communications group would not be
in the interest of shareholders, except for the McCaffrey and
McCall deal.
   There has been speculation in the British media that Saatchi
might sell other parts of its ad empire.
   The new chief executive also said: ``I want to stress that we
are not looking for an injection of new equity from a friendly
outside party.''
   Southeastern Asset Management Inc., a Memphis, Tenn.-based
investment company, has built up an 11.2 percent stake in Saatchi.

   Prices closed broadly lower on Wall Street
today, depressed by a new round of interest rate concerns.
   The stock market opened lower and then tried to shake off a
decline in the bond market, which skidded following a Commerce
Department report that retail sales fell 0.9 percent in February.
But when the credit market's slide steepened, stock prices followed

while its yield shot up to 8.71 percent from 8.61 percent late
Monday.
   The retail sales drop was the steepest in four months, but
analysts said the decline was due almost entirely to sagging
automobiles sales and that other segments experienced healthy
increases.
   The report was seen as a sign of economic health, and as such a
signal that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to move interest rates
lower anytime soon.
   Stock traders were also uneasy about the rise in credit market
yields, which affect other interest rates.

<HEAD>Trump Shuttle Offering Guarantees of On-Time Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trump Shuttle announced Tuesday it is offering
an ``unconditional'' guarantee that its hourly flights will arrive
promptly, or customers will be compensated.
   Trump Shuttle, the northeast airline service named after the
real estate tycoon who bought it last spring, said the guarantee
will be available starting Wednesday through March 31.
   If a flight arrives more than 15 minutes later than scheduled
arrival, passengers will have a choice of three premiums: 5,000
bonus frequent-flier miles for their next Trump Shuttle flight, a
free companion ticket for their next weekend shuttle flight or a
$20 American Express restaurant certificate.
   The guarantee also covers late arrivals due to weather
conditions or other factors beyond the airline's control.
   ``We are able to make this unusual offer to our customers
because we have an outstanding on-time arrival record,'' Trump
Shuttle President Bruce Nobles said in a statement.
   He said the airline's flights, which link New York with Boston
and Washington, arrive within 15 minutes of schedule more than 90
percent of the time, despite difficult weather and crowded airports.
   Billionaire developer Donald Trump bought the shuttle service
from Eastern Airlines for $365 million last June.
   Pan Am Corp., which operates a rival shuttle service, doesn't
plan to match the guarantee offer, said spokeswoman Elizabeth
Manners.
   ``We feel that passengers expect that Pan Am flights will arrive
on time,'' she said.
   So far this month, 95 percent of Pan Am's shuttle flights have
arrived within 15 minutes of schedule, Ms. Manners said.
   Both shuttle services, which are geared mainly to business
travelers, raised their one-way weekday fares by 20 percent, from
$99 to $119, on Jan. 3.

   Roberts, 50, left GM in August 1988after an 11-year career in
which he earned a reputation as a dynamic leader with respect for
human values and a position as the highest-ranking black executive
at the industrial giant.
   At Navistar, Roberts was the No. 3 executive of the Fortune 500
manufacturer, in charge of a truck division that was the North
American leader.
   But he couldn't bypass the opportunity presented at GM.
   ``My business roots are at GM,'' Roberts said. ``When I was
there, I spent most of my time in operations, that's where most of
my abilities are concentrated.
   ``When this job came open, I realized it was where I wanted to
be,'' he said Monday from Navistar headquarters in Chicago. Roberts
did not return a telephone message left for him Tuesday at Navistar
headquarters.
   GM reportedly is considering consolidating all manufacturing of
its luxury cars at its plant in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck.
All Cadillacs now are assembled there except the Brougham, which is
made in Arlington, Texas, and the De Ville and Fleetwood sedan,
which are made near Pontiac, Mich.
   As director of manufacturing, Roberts would be centrally
involved in any move of Cadillac production to one location.
   ``All my life I've wanted to make sure I was doing a job that
had challenges,'' Roberts said. ``You look at the luxury car
business and it's getting to be one of the most competitive turfs
in this country, and we want to take that on.''
   Roberts joined GM in 1977 as a salaried employee in training at
the former Diesel Equipment Division in Grand Rapids, Mich. In
1981, he was promoted to plant manager in Grand Rapids and two
years later, was transferred to Rochester, N.Y., as Rochester
Products Division's eastern operations manager.
   He rose through plant management ranks to take charge of GM's
North Tarrytown, N.Y., assembly plant in December 1985. He has been
credited with saving that plant and about 4,000 jobs by convincing
upper-level management to build GM's new plastic-body minivans
there.
   On April 1, 1987 he was named vice president for personnel
administration, at a time the company was in the process of laying
off 40,000 white-collar workers. That promotion, largely at the
urging of GM Executive Vice President Elmer Johnson, jumped him
across half a dozen management levels and made him the
highest-ranking black at GM.
   Roberts became vice president for truck operations at Navistar
in August 1988, a few months after Johnson quit GM to go into
private law practice.
   GM spokeswoman Patricia Malloy said Tuesday that as general
manager of Cadillac manufacturing, Roberts will be among the
highest-ranking blacks in the company, but will not be an officer
of the corporation as he was while one of more than three dozen GM
vice presidents.
   ``It doesn't make any difference,'' Roberts said. ``What I care
about is the challenge and the opportunity. The title has nothing
to do with it.''
   Roberts was one of 10 children born to a family in Magnolia,
Ark. His mother died when he was 2 and his father moved the family
to Michigan, where Roberts began his career on the factory floor at
Grand Rapids auto parts supplier Lear Siegler Inc. in 1959.
   Roberts worked nights so he could go to school and earn a
business administration degree while also supporting a family.

   President Bush said Tuesday that an ambitious
deficit-cutting plan by Democratic Rep. Dan Rostenkowski could help
``break the ice'' toward reaching a long-range budget pact with
Congress.
   Neither Bush nor Budget Director Richard Darman offered much
encouragement that the administration would support the plan's two
most controversial elements _ a Social Security freeze and a tax
increase. But Darman appeared to open the door a crack to a
possible compromise that might include some form of higher excise
taxes.
   Rostenkowski proposed an increase in taxes on the highest-paid
Americans, along with a boost in excise taxes on gasoline, tobacco
and alcohol.
   ``We are willing to discuss any proposals on the merits,'' even
tax increases, Darman told reporters.
   Darman said the administration still believes deficit-reduction
``can be achieved without having to go to income tax increases.''
But, he added, ``you can't go into a negotiation and say it's
absolutely, totally, completely, forever inconceivable that your
view of the merits wouldn't change.''
   At a White House news conference, Bush asked: ``Are we prepared
to negotiate?'' He then answered his own question: ``Absolutely.''
   On another economic policy matter, Bush denied he was
considering replacing Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board in a dispute over interest-rate policy.
   ``There's no bubbling war with Alan Greenspan,'' Bush said.
``I'm not in a Fed-bashing mode.''
   He said he and Greenspan have had differences over how high
interest rates should be, adding: ``Every president would like to
see interest rates lower.''
   The Los Angeles Times reported last week that Bush was so
unhappy with Greenspan's tight-credit policies that he likely would
replace him when his term as chairman expires in 1991.
   ``There is no discussion of that nature at all,'' Bush said.
   Both Bush and Darman seemed to go out of their way to praise the
deficit-reduction plan put forward several days ago by
Rostenkowski, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   ``It is the first serious proposal that has been put in the
public domain by Democrats,'' Darman said.
   The administration, Darman said, has ``serious disagreements''
with parts of the plan, including the Social Security freeze and
call for higher taxes. But he generally praised its proposal for a
freeze on other programs, for using defense savings to trim the
deficit and for restraining Medicaid payments.
   He denied the administration was trying to short-circuit the
congressional process by reacting to Rostenkowski's plan before the
House and Senate budget committees come up with their own proposal.
   The committees, he said, are ``just not close to being able to
put together a budget resolution and it's important that there be
something there to negotiate with.''
   Darman said that, while the administration remains steadfast in
its opposition to higher income taxes, it does not categorically
reject higher excise taxes _ so long as the increase can be
justified as a ``user fee'' in which the person paying the higher
tax benefits from the spending.
   However, he said Rostenkowski's suggestion of a gasoline tax of
20 or 25 cents a gallon was too high to merit administration
support.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he thought some of
the administration's kind reaction toward Rostenkowski's proposal
was because of their personal friendship.
   ``That doesn't speak of any substantive change on the part of
the president to consider new taxes,'' he said.
   Foley declined to endorse Rostenkowski's plan, although he
repeated his assertion that any serious deficit reduction program
would have to include both spending restraint and new taxes.
   Rostenkowski's plan, which would replace the Gramm-Rudman Act
for chopping the deficit in stages, would raise taxes on the
highest-income wage earners from 28 percent to 33 percent and
increase taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and tobacco. It would also
freeze most federal programs, including Social Security, at present
levels for one year.
   That would deny some 39 million Americans a Social Security
cost-of-living increase scheduled for next January.
   The Illinois Democrat's plan would also rechannel some of the
``peace dividend,'' defense money saved because of reduced
East-West tensions, into further reducing the deficit.
   While making it clear he was not embracing the package in its
present form, Bush praised Rostenkowski for putting forward the
bold initiative with ``evident goodwill and determination to try to
break the ice and move the process forward.''
   Asked if he was for a tax increase at this time, Bush said:
``No, I'm not for a tax (increase).'' But he stopped short of
making the same pledge on Social Security.
   When asked if he would oppose a freeze on Social Security
benefits, Bush said: ``Well, there are a lot of things I'm not for
in his proposal _ a lot _ including taxes.''
   Bush, who in the past has threatened to have his veto pen ready
for any proposed tax increase passed by Congress, on Tuesday
offered a much milder response when asked if he could assure
Americans that there would be no new taxes this year.
   ``I'm only one player, but you know my position, and I have no
intention of changing that position,'' Bush said.
   When a reporter pressed further and asked Bush under what
circumstances he might support a tax increase, he shot back: ``Too
hypothetical. Nice try.''
   Summing up action on the deficit, Bush noted that Rostenkowski
had proposed his plan, ``we've thrown our idea out'' with the
fiscal 1991 budget, and now ``we'd like the budget leaders on the
Hill to throw theirs out ... and then perhaps we can talk.''
   The Congressional Budget Office projects the budget shortfall in
fiscal 1991 _ which begins Oct. 1 _ will be $161 billion; the White
House Office of Management and Budget says it will be $100.5
billion if existing programs are left unchanged.
   Rostenkowski _ whose committee oversees taxes, Social Security
and other federal benefit programs _ says his package would reduce
next year's deficit to $106 billion and lead to a $2 billion
surplus by fiscal 1994.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, has said that Rostenkowski's proposal for tax increases
and a one-year freeze on Social Security increases would be ``very
huge political barriers'' to overcome.

<TEXT>
   Rorer Group Inc. announced Tuesday
it will work jointly with the consumer products giant Procter &amp;
Gamble to develop and market prescription and over-the-counter
pharmaceutical products.
   The move comes one day after the suburban Philadelphia-based
company announced a $1.7 billion agreement to merge with the
pharmaceuticals operations of Rhone-Poulenc SA of Paris.
   The alliance between Rorer and Cincinatti-based Procter &amp; Gamble
gives Rorer a major worldwide distribution system for its main
product, the antacid Maalox. In addition to Maalox, Procter &amp;
Gamble obtains exclusive U.S. marketing and distribution rights to
Rorer's line of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, which include
Ascriptin and Perdiem.
   Rorer, which will continue to manufacture the drugs, will gain
rights to develop and market De-Nol, an anti-ulcer drug, and other
prescription gastrointestinal compounds that Procter &amp; Gamble has
been developing.
   Procter &amp; Gamble is still negotiating for international rights
to market and distribute some of Rorer's over-the-counter
pharmaceuticals.
   Rorer will retain ownership of its brands, while Procter &amp;
Gamble will receive royalty payments for the prescription products.
Both companies will share in the growth of the business.
   ``P&amp;G gains entry into a core over-the-counter category with a
leading antacid brand with no major upfront capital investment,''
Procter &amp; Gamble Chairman Edwin L. Artzt said in a statement.
   Rorer Chairman Robert E. Cawthorn said the alliance ``further
promotes Rorer's strategic objective of becoming a world-class
pharmaceutical company through research, internal growth and
business alliances.''
   ``This agreement maximizes the potential of Maalox,'' he said.
``Maalox and our other over-the-counter products will gain wider
distribution by utilizing Procter &amp; Gamble's extensive distribution
system.''
   Samuel D. Isaly, of Mehta &amp; Isaly pharmaceutical specialists,
said the deal ``is a lovely transaction'' for both companies.
   ``In the hands of Rorer, Maalox had a pretty bad future,'' he
said.
   New Brunswick, N.J.-based Johnson &amp; Johnson has heavily
advertised a competing antacid, Mylanta, he said, and the
government is considering allowing a variety of prescription ulcer
drugs to be sold over the counter.
   With Procter &amp; Gamble's better distribution system, Maalox will
be more competitive, he said.
   As for Procter &amp; Gamble, ``this gives them an extra brand name
they can promote,'' said Isaly, who noted the company already
distributes Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol.
   Under Tuesday's agreement, Procter &amp; Gamble also has received
the rights to purchase Rorer's over-the-counter pharmaceutical
company if Rorer decides to sell it.
   ``That's pretty important,'' said Ron Nordmann of PaineWebber
Group Inc. ``It is perhaps an indication that the newly-formed
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer might want to focus more on prescription drugs
and research.''
   Igor Landau, president of Rhone-Poulenc's health sector, said
the agreement with Procter &amp; Gamble is consistent with the newly
combined Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s strategy of developing and
strengthening its U.S. market.
   Access to U.S. markets was considered a major reason for the
merger with Rorer. Although Rhone-Poulenc is in the top 10 in the
European pharmaceutical market, it had no direct marketing in the
United States or Japan.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, with sales of $21.4 billion last year,
manufactures and markets health care products as well as a wide
range of laundry and cleaning products, personal care products,
food and beverage products.
   Rorer Group Inc. had $1.2 billion in 1989 sales.
   Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. is expected to have annual sales
exceeding $3 billion.
   That merger will progress in stages, with Rhone-Poulenc
eventually obtaining 68 percent of Rorer by June 1990. In exchange,
Rorer will take on $265 million of Rhone-Poulenc debt and acquire
the French group's existing U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary for $20
million.

   Crude oil futures prices were down slightly
Tuesday after a late round of selling.
   Analysts said crude had rallied higher after five straight days
of declines, helped by a surge in gasoline futures prices, but
traders sold off after crude hit $20.50 a barrel.
   The contract for April delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
key grade of U.S. crude oil, ended 2 cents lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at $20.22 a 42-gallon barrel after a 19-cent
drop Monday. Subsequent contract months ranged from down 1 cent to
up 3 cents a barrel.
   ``It seems to have been primarily technical in nature because
there was no fresh fundamental news that I caught,'' Peter Beutel,
analyst with Elders Futures Inc., said of the trading activity.
   Trading also was cautious in advance of the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly report, which was released after the close
Tuesday.
   It showed crude oil inventories increased about 7 million
barrels in the week ending last Friday compared to the previous
week, a negative sign for futures prices. Gasoline stocks fell 2.5
million barrels, supporting that market. Distillate fuels were down
3 million barrels, the API report said.
   Unseasonably warm temperatures continued to depress heating oil
prices. The contract for April delivery of home heating oil fell
0.02 cent to 53.51 cents a gallon on the New York Merc, after
falling 0.33 cent on Monday. Subsequent contract months also
declined Tuesday.
   The April contract for unleaded regular gasoline jumped 0.54
cent to 54.87 cents a gallon after a 0.66 cent loss on Monday. The
May contract declined by 0.08 cent while later contract months were
higher.

<HEAD>Strong Dollar Holds Gold Futures Down Near $400</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures dropped again Tuesday and analysts said the price
could fall $385 an ounce before enough buyers surface to offset the
negative effects of the strengthening dollar.
   On other commodity markets, silver futures rose; copper plunged;
coffee and cocoa futures surged; grains and soybeans slumped;
cattle futures gained; pork futures retreated; and energy futures
were mixed.
   Gold futures settled 40 cents lower to 50 cents higher on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in April
down 40 cents at $400.70 a troy ounce.
   Silver futures finished 1.5 to 1.7 cents higher with March at
$5.059 a troy ounce.
   April gold traded as low as $396.70, a four-month low, during
the session but bounced back shortly before the close as the stock
market and the dollar weakened.
   Analysts said the dollar's strength has become the dominant
factor in the declining gold market, which traded near $430 for
April delivery as recently as Feb. 7.
   The dollar recently has risen to its highest levels in nearly
three years against the Japanese yen and has been gaining against
the West German mark, largely due to market worries about the
economic prospects for those two countries.
   ``The market is paying virtually no attention to anything but
the dollar at the moment and that is likely to continue as long as
the dollar continues to strengthen,'' said William O'Neill,
commodity research director for Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Analysts said significant buying of gold could appear in the
range of $385 to $390 an ounce.
   Copper futures plunged on the Comex late in the session as the
stock market retreated. The copper market had been quiet for most
of the day amid uneasiness about a strike that began Monday at the
Southern Peru Copper Corp.
   Copper futures settled 1.5 cents to 2.3 cents lower with March
at $1.19 a pound.
   Coffee and cocoa futures rose sharply on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange amid fears of supply disruptions due to
political unrest in the Ivory Coast, a major exporter of both
commodities.
   The coffee market also was supported by the return of hot, dry
weather to Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, where poor
growing conditions have already prompted government agencies to
lower their yield predictions for the new coffee crop.
   Coffee settled 2.17 cents to 3 cents higher with March at 96.25
cents a pound; cocoa futures finished $31 to $38 higher with March
at $1,113 per ton.
   Grain and soybean futures fell on the Chicago Board of Trade due
to rainy weather, increased farmer selling of corn and indications
of adequate soybean oil supplies.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower with March at
$3.81 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with March at
$2.43} a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 2} cents lower with March at
$1.45{ a bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents to 6} cents lower with
March at $5.78{ a bushel.
   Stronger cash markets supported cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork futures fell sharply late in the
session amid expectations for a large weekly increase in supplies
of frozen pork bellies.
   The exchange's weekly storage report, issued after the close,
showed a net increase of 2.18 million pounds of bellies in cold
storage, a figure that was even larger than expected.
   Cattle futures settled .10 cent to .62 cent higher with April at
78.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent to .72 cent higher
with March at 83.15 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .60
cent lower with April at 52.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .50 cent to 1.37 cents lower with March at 52.45 cents a pound.
   Petroleum futures ended mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly
inventory report, which showed greater-than-expected U.S. supplies
of crude oil and larger-than-expected declines in supplies of both
gasoline and distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures finished 2 cents lower
to 3 cents higher with April at $20.22 a barrel; heating oil was
.02 cent to .22 cent lower with April at 53.51 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .08 cent lower to .54 cent higher with April
at 54.87 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Macy Reports $39 Million Loss After Disppointing Christmas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. on Tuesday reported a $39
million loss in its most crucial quarter following a disappointing
Christmas shopping season, increasing the financial pressures on
the debt-burdened retailing chain.
   Macy, which went private in a leveraged buyout in 1986, said
markdowns the company was forced to take to compete with price
cutting at Campeau Corp.'s department stores took a heavy toll on
its balance sheet.
   The second-quarter loss, which translated to $27.67 per share,
compared with the $72.6 million, or $39.85 per share, Macy earned
in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales during the quarter ended Jan. 27 totaled $2.44 billion, up
from $2.28 billion a year earlier.
   Pamela Stubing, a retail industry analyst with Moody's Investors
Service Inc., said many of Macy's stores in the Northeast had stiff
competition from Campeau's Federated Department Stores and Allied
Stores units. Macy, choosing to defend market share rather than
profit margins, cut prices to keep its customers, she said.
   Federated and Allied, which were on the brink of a Chapter 11
bankruptcy court filing, slashed their prices during the holiday
season to bring in cash.
   The loss could not have come at a worse time. Macy's second
quarter _ the fourth quarter for most other major retailers _ is
when the company hopes to earn half its annual profits.
   The company also is dependent on its cash flow to pay down the
remaining debt from its leveraged buyout. Macy's earnings statement
reported nearly $4.54 billion in long-term debt as of Jan. 27, and
$189 million in interest charges during the second quarter.
   Walter Loeb, a retail consultant and analyst, said Macy also was
hurt by overstocking its private label merchandise. To reduce
inventory, the company again was forced to cut its prices, he said.
   But the company succeeded in cushioning the shock about the
dismal quarter, having signaled to investors and its suppliers some
time ago that it expected to report a sharp loss, Loeb said.
   Loeb said Macy's will continue to have problems in the near
term, but he said there were signs the retailer would fare better
during the spring because of warmer weather and because the company
is going into the season with a leaner inventory.
   In a letter to its investors dated Monday, Macy said it was
prepared for the economy to remain flat during the spring and fall
seasons, indicating the retailer does not expect a burst of
consumer spending.
   Ms. Stubing predicted the retail environment would be less
promotional _ meaning fewer markdowns to draw customers _ during
Macy's second half, although the company still faces tough
competition.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year, Macy lost $72.2
million, or $51.58 per share, compared to earnings of $53.6
million, or $24.75 per share, in the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the first half rose to $4.15 billion from $3.9 billion.
   Loeb said the financial and retail industries have confidence in
Macy Chairman Edward Finkelstein, who shaped the company's buyout
and its retailing strategy.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, the company owns I. Magnin and Bullock's stores in
California and the West. It also owns specialty stores including
Charter Club and Aeropostale, which are stocked with Macy's private
label apparel brands.

<HEAD>Experts: Politics Will Guide Future of Nicaraguan Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed Nicaraguan aid package and the lifting
of a U.S. trade embargo will help awaken the nation's decimated
manufacturing and agricultural economies, but political stability
is the key to a full recovery, business leaders and economists said
Tuesday.
   The $300 million aid request announced by President Bush may
give Nicaraguans needed hard currency to upgrade factories and
purchase parts for machinery and farm equipment, which have fallen
into disrepair during the five-year trade embargo.
   But experts predict foreign investors will not likely return
until the Sandinistas prove they will not violently oppose the
government of president-elect Violeta Chamorro, winner of last
month's elections.
   ``The aid is the first critical step to bring Nicaragua back
from near bankruptcy,'' said Manuel Lasaga, a senior economist at
Southeast Bank in Miami. ``The long-term prospects for the country
depend heavily on the political situation. There will be no big
investment until Nicaragua proves it's a place where business can
be done.''
   The embargo, established by President Reagan against the
Sandinista government, cut off Nicaragua from lucrative U.S.
markets for products such as sugar, coffee and bananas. It also
effectively blocked the nation from receiving loans from aid
organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank.
   Lack of money and investment _ coupled by high inflation and the
costs of fighting the U.S.-backed Contras _ caused the economy to
founder. Nicaraguan exports, which reached $650 million in the
1970s, are presently less than $200 million. Meanwhile, the
nation's foreign debt has grown four-fold to $8 billion since 1980.
   Bush said Tuesday he will ask Congress to appropriate $300
million immediately for Nicaragua, and said he will also seek an
additional $200 million in economic assistance in fiscal year 1991,
which begins Oct. 1.
   In Miami, home to 50,000 to 100,000 Nicaraguan exiles, there is
optimism among business leaders that commerce with Nicaragua will
resume soon.
   Carlos Perez, a former U.S. House candidate and well-known GOP
supporter, said he may re-establish his banana import business.
   ``We have to take advantage of this to show that there is an
atmosphere in in Nicaragua where business can thrive,'' said Perez,
who was cited by Reagan as an immigrant success story. ``It will be
a slow process, but at least it's beginning.''
   Ties with Miami-based Nicaraguans should also help integrate
Nicaragua into the global marketplace, said Roberto Arguello,
founder of the Miami-based Nicaraguan Banker's and Businessman's
Association.
   Arguello, however, does not foresee many Nicaraguans returning
permanently to open businesses.
   ``I see a strong link between Miami and Managua,'' said
Arguello. ``There are a lot of people here who have made money in
America and know how the system works. We can be an invaluable
assistance to those starting up in Nicaragua.''
   But several major obstacles stand in the way of Nicaragua's full
economic rebound, several experts say.
   The embargo destroyed the North American distribution network
for most Nicaraguan products, particuarly highly perishable crops.
Also, Nicaragua is not part of the Caribbean Basin Initiative,
which provides member nations with duty-free entry into the U.S.
market for most products.
   ``It's obvious that Nicaragua could not compete unless it's a
member of CBI,'' said Gordon Studebaker, director of the U.S.
Department of Commerce office responsible for Caribbean business
development. ``But I think it's in everyone's best interest to work
quickly to bring Nicaragua into the program.''
   Panama will officially return to the 7-year-old CBI next week,
bringing the total to 23 nations.
   ``The decision to offer direct loans to Nicaragua has a
psychological effect on private lenders and international
businessmen,'' said Dario Moreno, an assistant professor at Florida
International University who specializes in U.S.-Nicaragua affairs.
``It shows the Bush administration is giving its approval to the
new regime and says, `This is a regime we can trust.' Business
people watch this closely. Private money tends to follow public
money.''
   A more cautious tone is sounded by Ambler Moss, a former U.S.
ambassador to Panama and dean of the University of Miami Graduate
School of International Studies.
   ``You have to look behind all the `happy talk' and see what
really is going to happen with the aid and how quickly the
sanctions will be lifted,'' he said. ``Nicaragua still has a long
way to go.''

   The dollar finished slightly lower in moderate
trading Tuesday amid confusion about a plan for German monetary
unification, reversing earlier gains in overseas markets, traders
said.
   Gold prices also slipped. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid of $398.70 a troy ounce, down 55 cents from late
Monday. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
settled at $399 a troy ounce, down 80 cents.
   Traders said the dollar opened higher in New York, boosted by
its rise overseas. It advanced to its high for the day against the
West German mark on a midday report that West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said East Germans would be able to convert their
savings to the West German currency at a rate of one East German
mark for one West German mark, traders said.
   Economists say converting the currency at that rate could cause
inflation in West Germany, which would devalue the West German mark.
   However, the market later learned that the one-for-one currency
swap under consideration would apply only to small savings
accounts, traders said. The news sparked a sharp selloff in dollar.
   ``I've never seen anything like it and I've been in the market
11 years,'' said Abigail Cook, a dealer with Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corp.
   She said the dollar drop lasted a few minutes before the
currency stabilized at a lower level.
   The dollar closed in New York at 1.7120 West German marks, down
from its high of the day of 1.7218 and from Monday's late figure of
1.7135 marks. Earlier, in Europe, the dollar closed at 1.7165 West
German marks, up from 1.7110 Monday.
   The market had little reaction to government reports showing the
deficit in the broadest measure of U.S. trade sank to a five-year
low last year, and that retail sales in February took their
steepest fall in four months.
   The figures were about what the market expected, said Robert
Hatcher, a dealer with Barclays Bank PLC.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 152.67 Japanese yen _ the
lowest level for the yen against the dollar in exactly three years
_ from 152.00 yen Monday. Later, in London, it fell to 152.52 yen.
In New York, the dollar fell to 152.20 yen from 152.63 yen late
Monday.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6005 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6100 late Monday. Later,
in New York, it closed at $1.6097, down from $1.6115 late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.5215 Swiss francs, down from 1.5258; 5.7850 French
francs, down from 5.7915; 1,264.50 Italian lire, down from
1,265.50; and 1.1761 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1787.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.5275 Swiss francs, up from 1.5235; 5.7915 French francs, up from
5.7800; 1.9312 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9190; 1,267.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,263.75; and 1.1775 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1787.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $396.55 a troy ounce from
$400.65 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of
$396 an ounce from $401.10 Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.94 to close at a bid $399.08
an ounce.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.05 a troy

   AT&amp;T and Tandem Computers Inc.
announced Tuesday they are joining forces under a cooperative
research and marketing accord, a deal that analysts said provides a
major endorsement of Tandem's computer technology.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. is acquiring worldwide rights
to market Tandem's ``fault-tolerant'' computers, which have
built-in redundancies to prevent accidental crashes or shutdowns.
The computers use a modified version of the Unix operating system
software developed by AT&amp;T.
   The alliance provides for joint development aimed at speeding up
the availability and acceptance of fault-tolerant hardware and
software based on Unix, the companies said.
   ``This agreement combines AT&amp;T's strength in open systems and
networking with Tandem's leadership in fault-tolerant platforms,''
said Richard A. McGinn, president of AT&amp;T Computer Systems, based
in Morristown, N.J.
   Industry analysts praised the pact.
   ``It's obviously good for Tandem,'' said Peter Rogers, an
analyst with the Robertson &amp; Stevens brokerage in San Francisco.
``It's a major endorsement for their architecture and a strong
endorsement for their Unix offerings.''
   ``It gives Tandem another source of pretty powerful marketing,''
said Robert Kidd, an analyst with Dataquest Inc., a San Jose-based
market research firm. ``AT&amp;T and the federal government fit
together like yin and yang. This certainly serves to strengthen
Tandem's ties to the government market.''
   AT&amp;T strongly denied suggestions by some industry observers that
it might be phasing out its own line of minicomputers and instead
rely on remarketing those made by other firms, such as Tandem.
   ``Hogwash! It's not true, absolutely not true,'' said James
Clark, an AT&amp;T Computer Systems vice president. The deal with
Tandem ``simply expands the range of systems we have,'' he said.

   Burger King Corp. announced Tuesday that C. Ronald
Petty, president and chief operating officer of Burger King USA, is
leaving the worldwide fast-food chain after 12 years.
   Petty, who returned from Burger King's international division to
run the domestic side of the corporation just before Burger King
was taken over by Grand Metropolitan in January 1989, decided only
recently to leave the firm, said Barry J. Gibbons, chief executive
officer of Burger King Corp.
   ``We both decided we would get right down to the urgent tasks at
hand (after the acquisition) and take a year or so to decide
whether we wanted to work together long term,'' Gibbons said in a
statement Tuesday.
   ``We have had that review and decided to change. I would like to
pay open tribute to Ron for his contribution to Burger King over
the years, and in particular to our progress over the last 12
months,'' he said.
   Gibbons will assume the responsibilities of chief operating
officer for the U.S. division pending a further announcement, said
Cori Zywotow, a spokeswoman at Burger King's Miami headquarters.
   Petty's departure was unrelated to a lawsuit announced Thursday
by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole accusing Burger King of violating
child labor laws by assigning workers under 16 to late-night shifts
and too many hours, she said.
   ``It was not related. Their shared decision was made prior to
the Dole announcement,'' Ms. Zywotow said.
   Burger King and its franchisees operate more than 6,000
restaurants in 34 countries worldwide. In fiscal year 1989, the
company had systemwide sales of $5.7 billion.
   Grand Metropolitan is one of the United Kingdom's largest
international companies and a world leader in the food, drinks and
retailing businesses.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. and a subsidiary of Sun
Oil Co. on Tuesday announced a joint research program to study use
of a methanol-based automotive fuel outside California.
   Most street testing of alternative fuels by the nation's Big
Three automakers has taken place in California, which has the
strictest air pollution laws in the United States.
   Ford will provide a fleet of 30 mid- and full-size cars and
full-size vans to be powered by a mixture of 85 percent methanol
and 15 percent gasoline. The mixture, called M85, will be provided
by Sun Refining and Marketing Co.
   The vehicles will be driven mostly by Ford employees and the
fuel will be supplied beginning next week by a Sunoco service
station in Dearborn, near Detroit.
   Automakers have been looking into powering automobiles and
trucks with fuels other than gasoline as they try to reduce
tailpipe emissions in anticipation of stricter government
regulations.
   Last December, Ford delivered a fleet of 210 vehicles powered by
M85 to California and currently operates a 30-vehicle fleet
elsewhere.
   ``All of our previous retail station experience has been in the
mild climate of California,'' said Donald Buist, director of
automotive emissions and fuel economy for Ford.
   ``This program with Sun will allow us to learn even more about
methanol storage, delivery and use as a real-world fuel before we
move to any widescale efforts to put such vehicles into our
customers' hands,'' he said.

<HEAD>Multimedia Sells Its Two Florida Papers to Kansas City Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Multimedia Inc. announced Tuesday it
will sell its two newspapers in Florida to Stauffer Communications
Inc. for an undisclosed price.
   The sale of The News Chief of Winter Haven, a daily, and The
Auburndale Star, a weekly, is mutually beneficial to Multimedia and
Stauffer, said Walter E. Bartlett, chairman of the board of
Multimedia.
   ``Stauffer has made a significant investment in print media in
Polk County and the Winter Haven area,'' he said. ``This
acquisition would add substantially to their presence there.''
   The purchase price of the two papers was not disclosed, and the
sale was contingent upon completing the purchase agreement, which
was expected by April 1, officials said.
   Multimedia Inc., which is based in Greenville, publishes 14
daily and 50 non-daily newspapers, owns and operates four
television and seven radio stations, and operates more than 100
cable television franchises in four states. The company also
produces and syndicates television programming, including the Phil
Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael shows.
   Stauffer, which is based in Topeka, Kansas, owns 22 daily and
eight weekly newspapers, and six television and five radio stations
in 15 states. The company also publishes two periodicals, Grit and
Cappers, and operates the Kansas City Royals radio network.
   The News Chief, an afternoon paper with a circulation of about
20,000 ``will be Stauffer Communications' flagship Florida
newspaper,'' chairman of the board Stanley H. Stauffer said.
``Moreover, the Winter Haven and Auburndale publications will
greatly enhance our other Florida operations.''
   Donald R. Hatley, publisher of The News Chief, will remain with
Multimedia Newspaper Co. in a corporate role. Hatley will continue
to manage the paper until the transaction is completed.
   Kenneth C. Bronson, vice president of newspapers for Stauffer,
said when his company takes over operations of the two papers, he
will announce a new publisher for each. No other personnel changes
are planned, he said.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
announced Tuesday the breakup of its financing unit into a group of

   The reorganization puts the former AT&amp;T Credit Corp. into a
family of holdings that will provide financing and equipment
leasing services at different levels for the AT&amp;T parent and other
companies.
   Growth at AT&amp;T Credit into different areas prompted the
restructuring, said AT&amp;T spokesman Charlie Wade. The unit in 1989
accounted for $442 million of the company's $36.11 billion in
revenue, he said.
   AT&amp;T Capital will preside over five companies, including AT&amp;T
Credit.
   The new units will finance equipment purchases by AT&amp;T customers
and lease equipment for internal AT&amp;T uses and to outside customers.
   The reorganization is expected to be completed by the end of the
month.

   Prices slumped on Wall Street Tuesday as the
stock market, taking another cue from the bond market, succumbed to
concerns about rising interest rates.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.16 to 2,674.55.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 7 to
4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 557 up, 913 down and 498 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.44 million
shares, up from 114.79 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 172.68 million shares.
   The stock market began the day on the down side after bond
prices fell in response to the Commerce Department's report of a
0.9 percent drop in retail sales in February.
   The sales drop was the steepest in four months, but analysts
said it was due almost entirely to sagging automobiles sales. Other
segments of consumer spending experienced healthy increases, they
said.
   The report was seen as a sign of economic health, and as such a
signal that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to move interest rates
lower anytime soon.
   Wall Street tried to shake off the news and the bond market's
decline, but when Treasury prices fell further, stocks joined the
sell-off.
   Stock traders were also uneasy about the rise in credit market
yields, which affect other interest rates.
   By the end of trading on Wall Street, the yield on the
Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond had shot up to 8.71 percent from
8.61 late Monday. The bond's price was down $11.25 for each $1,000
in face amount.
   Concerns about interest rates have dominated Wall Street since
the beginning of the year and forced stock traders to pay close
attention to the credit markets.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Unisys, up { to
15|.
   Among blue chip stocks, which had led the brief recovery, IBM
was off 1{ to 106\, Exxon was down ~ to 45|, and Philip Morris was
off &rsqb; to 37|.
   Selective airline stocks outperformed the market. AMR was up 1&rsqb;
to 64~, Delta picked up 1| to 71} and UAL rose 3&rsqb; to 139~.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $20.525 billion, or 0.63
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.26 to 185.25.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 3.10 to 388.15, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was off 2.67 at 336.00.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slipped 1.98 to 434.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 360.79, down 1.98.

   A House committee approved Tuesday an overhaul
of the nation's hazardous materials transportation law, including
controls on using the same vehicle to ship both wastes and food.
   The measure won approval from the Energy and Commerce Committee
on a voice vote. A key provision would place controls on
``backhauling'' _ carrying food, drugs or cosmetics in vehicles
used to ship wastes or hazardous materials.
   Lawmakers introduced the backhauling provision after learning
that shippers with food products from the Midwest were picking up
garbage on the return trip from the East, where landfill space is
scarce.
   The same vehicles would then ship food again without proper
cleaning.
   The panel approved the backhauling measure as a separate bill
and also attached it to its broader hazardous materials legislation
before voting that out of committee.
   It would require federal officials to set standards for which
materials could be shipped in the same vehicle.
   A backhauling bill applying only to highway vehicles and not
railroads has been passed by the Public Works and Transportation
Committee. The Energy and Commerce version embraces the key
provisions of that bill and extends its coverage to railroads.
   The Energy and Commerce version, sponsored by Rep. Thomas A.
Luken, D-Ohio, also gives standard-setting authority to three
government agencies: Transportation Department, Department of
Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The overall hazardous materials bill approved by the committee
seeks to tighten controls over an estimated 4 billion tons shipped
annually.
   The bill calls for:
   _ New regulations governing the marking and registration of
hazardous shipments, with ready availability of emergency
information.
   _ New regulations on training requirements and response
procedures for fire department crews and others who deal with
hazardous materials.
   _ Detailed registration statements by those involved in shipping
hazardous materials.
   _ New standards for determining permissible routes and an
updated list of those routes.
   _ Higher penalties for violations.
   _ Requiring air-brake equipment supports on older rail tank cars.
   _ A state-by-state study of emergency response capability.
   _ A Transportation Department study of railroad tank car safety.

   The U.S. dollar eased slightly in early trading
against the Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange fell.
   The dollar opened at 151.90 yen, down from Tuesday's close of
152.67 yen, which was the Japanese currency's lowest level against
the dollar in three years.
   ``It seems that the dollar is in a stage of adjustment''
following its sharp rise the previous day, said a dealer with the
Bank of Tokyo.
   Market sentiment toward the dollar remains firm because of a
demand for the American currency by Japanese investors planning to
invest in the United States, he noted.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues,
which lost 747.66 points Tuesday, shed another 91.94 points, or
0.28 percent, moving to 32,528.63 shortly after the market opened.
   Investors were discouraged by an overnight decline on Wall
Street, securities dealers said. The stock market in Tokyo is
normally not active in March, when many Japanese companies settle
their accounts.

<TEXT>
   Dallas investor Harold Simmons said Tuesday he
would put an employee representative on the Lockheed Corp. board of
directors if he wins his proxy fight for the defense contractor.
   Simmons, Lockheed's largest stockholder with 19 percent, has
proposed replacing the company's entire 14-member board with his
own nominees, including former Sen. John Tower and former Chief of
Naval Operations Adm. Elmo Zumwalt.
   In a statement, Simmons said if he succeeds at Lockheed's March
29 stockholder meeting, he will move to create an additional board
seat for a representative of the employee stock ownership plan,
created last year after Simmons first began accumulating shares in
the Calabasas, Calif.-based company.
   ``We believe the employees in the Lockheed ESOP deserve board
representation,'' Simmons said. ``If we are successful, it would be
our plan to meet with ESOP participants to get their input and
recommend a director who fairly reflects the ESOP employees' vision
of Lockheed's future.''
   The ESOP controls about 1 million shares, Simmons said.
   Simmons began the proxy fight after Lockheed officials refused
to grant him seats on the board.
   Meeting with analysts in New York Monday, Simmons said he would
increase Lockheed's returns by concentrating on its core defense
and aerospace businesses.

also announced the cruzado, the national currency, would be
devalued 10.7 percent effective Monday, when the banks re-open.
   The three-day bank holiday was decreed by Zelia Cardoso de
Mello, the nation's new economic minister, who is to take office
Thursday with the new president.
   She said in a brief statement, ``The bank holiday was declared
to preserve the stability of markets until the whole package of
measures is announced. In the past few days, there has been a great
deal of speculative activity and we wanted to calm the market
down.''
   Ms. Cardoso de Mello, no relation to the president-elect,
offered no further information about the new economic proposals,
which are expected to be announced when the president-elect
addresses Congress Friday morning.
   The move took many locals and economists by surprise because
only a day earlier Ms. Cardoso de Mello had said, ``A bank holiday
is absolutely not necessary.''
   Analysts said the bank holiday was in response to large-scale
withdrawals from the $60 billion that rolls over every day on the
``overnight'' _ short-term deposits paying interest rates of up to
100 percent that the government uses to finance its burdensome $31
billion public deficit.
   Its public deficit contributes a large portion to Brazil's $114
billion foreign debt, which is the developing world's largest,
followed by Mexico and Argentina. Most of its debt is to U.S. and
European banks.
   Investors, uneasy about Collor de Mello's economic plans, have
used withdrawals from the ``overnight'' to speculate in gold and
the illegal but widely tolerated black market for dollars, causing
wild swings in their values in recent weeks.
   Collor de Mello, Brazil's first directly elected president in
almost 30 years, has promised free-market economic reforms to try
to bring down the debilitating inflation rate _ 2,700 percent the
past 12 months. February's inflation was 73 percent.
   Collor de Mello is to replace Jose Sarney, who took office in
1985 but by law could not run for re-election.
   The new economic package is rumored to include privatizations of
inefficient state companies, layoffs of thousands of public
employees and widescale spending cuts.
   Business leaders have expressed concern about a possible
wage-and-price freeze, the basis of four failed anti-inflationary
plans by the Sarney administration.
   Bank holidays are not common in Brazil. The last was Jan. 15,
1989, when Sarney decreed his fourth austerity package, popularly
known as the ``Summer Plan,'' which froze wages and prices on basic
goods.
   Both the president-elect and Ms. Cardoso de Mello have denied
they will implement a freeze.
   By Tuesday evening, lines stretched for blocks at automatic bank
machines in major cities with people trying to get cash for the
next several days. Withdrawals were limited to $47 per person per
day.
   ``The population can remain calm. There will be enough money for
the entire weekend,'' said Getulio Mota, manager of a Bradesco bank
branch in Rio de Janeiro, quashing rumors of cash shortages.
   Privately owned Jornal do Brasil radio in Rio reported the new
administration was planning to create a new currency but Central
Bank spokesman Petro Kleinberg said he knew nothing of such a plan.
   The devaluation was much larger than normal. Officials have been
devaluing the cruzado about 2 percent daily to keep up with
inflation.
   Brazil, with about 150 million residents, has been wracked for
years by persistently high inflation and an active labor movement
that wages debilitating strikes for higher salaries and benefits.
   The unions in particular are strong.
   Of Brazil's 60-million-member work force, the leftist Central
Workers Union and the more moderate General Workers Center claim to
represent close to 35 million workers.
   Waves of strikes _ from schools to hospitals _ have rocked the
economy in recent months, including February when 60,000 Petrobras
oil workers staged an eight-day strike, paralyzing oil production
and refineries.
   Brazil's per capita income in 1986, the latest figures
available, was about $1,740 but real wages have declined for
several years due to raging inflation.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Against UPI in Photo Exchange Lawsuit</HEAD>

   A federal judge on Tuesday refused to order
Reuters to continue a picture exchange agreement with United Press
International.
   The judge said UPI had not shown it would be irreparably harmed
if the arrangement were discontinued.
   U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure made the finding in denying
UPI a preliminary injunction that would have barred Reuters from
carrying out its plan to pull out of the contract between the two
news services.
   The judge extended until Monday an earlier order that bars
Reuters from canceling the contract, so UPI can appeal his decision.
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed we didn't get the preliminary
injunction,'' said Milt Capps, UPI's senior vice president of
corporate affairs. ``However, we do take some encouragement from
the fact that the judge feels UPI will not be irreparably harmed,
and we are going to do everything possible to prove him right.''
   Lawyers for UPI said at a hearing Monday that they would appeal
if Leisure denied the injunction.
   ``The simple loss of customers ... is not sufficient to justify
the action sought,'' Leisure said in a written opinion. ``While
there may be some injury to UPI's business due to the loss of
Reuters' service, the court finds that such a loss could be
compensable in monetary terms.''
   The request for the injunction stemmed from a counterclaim by
UPI to a Reuters federal lawsuit that seeks to void the picture
exchange. Reuters said the agreement was not living up to
expectations.
   The contract was entered into in 1984 and called for UPI to
supply Reuters with pictures from the United States while Reuters
provided UPI with pictures from other countries. The international
pictures were to come from a global service that UPI had set up and
sold to Reuters. The agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in
1985.
   In legal papers filed Tuesday, UPI asked the court to return the
international photo service to UPI, Capps said.
   Leisure cited testimony Monday by the UPI chairman, Dr. Earl
Brian, who said some newspapers indicated they would drop the UPI
photo service if the Reuters contract is canceled.
   Brian also said UPI had been negotiating a photo exchange with
the French news service, Agence France-Presse, but that AFP only
agreed to give UPI a supply of photos for three months.
   ``While the court does find it likely that some UPI customers
may not be content with the replacement of Reuters by AFP, and may
choose to disconnect UPI, the loss of these individual customers is
simply not sufficient for the drastic relief sought by UPI,''
Leisure said.
