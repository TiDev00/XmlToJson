   Police units Saturday prevented Contra
rebel leaders from leaving two hotels where they came to negotiate
their disarmament with the government. One Contra leader said they
were being held ``hostage.''
   Later in the day, members of a government investigative team
announced they found no proof of Contra claims that the army
massacred 14 rebels who had laid down their weapons.
   Contra leaders broke off the disarmament talks with the
government on Friday demanding an investigation of the purported
army massacre of the rebel fighters and 100 civilians May 18 near
Waslala in Matagalpa province, 150 miles northeast of Managua.
   Contra commander Oscar Sovalbarro was named to the commission
created Friday, but he remained in Managua on Saturday in a hotel
where he said he and 18 other Contras were being held ``hostage''
by police.
   Sovalbarro said 10 other Contra leaders were prevented from
leaving another Managua hotel. He said the rebels were considering
a hunger strike in protest.
   The police who surrounded the Managua hotels did not appear to
be threatening the rebels, but Contra leaders said they were told
they could not leave the hotel grounds.
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo and Interior Minister
Carlos Hurtado told The Associated Press that police had been
placed at the hotel for the Contras' own protection.
   The leftist Sandinistas, who turned over power to President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro last month after losing February
elections, still control the military and police.
   Sovalbarro, also known as Commander Ruben, said Saturday's
police action showed the Contras ``have a good reason not to trust
the government.''
   He spoke from the garden of the Hotel Mercedes, where about two
dozen police from the elite black beret unit were seen patrolling.
   The investigative commission, named by Mrs. Chamorro, traveled
Saturday by helicopter to the area of the purported massacre and
interviewed army and rebel leaders, said Santiago Murray,
representative of the U.N. International Support and Verification
Commission, at a news conference later in the day.
   ``We haven't been able to confirm the existence of any dead
alleged by the Nicaraguan Resistance,'' he said.
   He said the commission members found no information about ``any
dead or other serious incident.''
   People interviewed near Waslala in the community of Zinica,
where rebels alleged the incident occurred, seemed surprised by
news of a massacre and said they had heard about it from a Managua
radio station.
   The investigating commission consisted of government delegates,
U.N. officials, Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo and a
Contra representative.
   A May 4 agreement between the Contras and the Chamorro
government set a June 10 deadline for more than 11,000 rebels to
surrender their weapons.
   But on May 19, the Contra high command suspended the
disarmament, claiming authorities were not providing enough food,
housing, jobs and security measures for fighters who lay down their
arms.
   Only 1,404 of the rebel fighters have been demobilized, the
government said.
   The U.S.-backed Contras fought the Sandinista government in a
10-year war that left 30,000 dead.
   The rebel fighters said they would give up their arms after Mrs.
Chamorro, also backed by the United States, took over the
presidency from Sandinista President Daniel Ortega on April 25.
   The Contras say their chief concern is that the army is
controlled mostly by Sandinistas.

<TEXT>
   Burmese voted Sunday in the country's
first multiparty election in 30 years, but the military regime has
kept some opponents out of the campaign and other groups were
boycotting the balloting.
   Pro-democracy forces hope the elections for a national assembly
will pave the way for an end to military rule. But some analysts
question whether the military intends to yield any real power to
liberal forces.
   In Rangoon, the capital, thousands of Burmese lined up outside
schools and government buildings before the polls opened at 6 a.m.
There were no immediate reports of any disturbances, and troops
kept largely out of sight.
   Gen. Saw Maung, the head of the ruling military council, said he
was ready to step aside for a civilian government.
   ``I have already abided by my promise and am going back to the
barracks,'' Maung told reporters after casting his ballot in
downtown Rangoon.
   ``I will transfer power according to the law.''
   He said the timetable for a transfer to civilian rule would
depend on the political parties in the national assembly. The
military has promised to step down from power when the parliament
puts together a new constitution, a process that could take several
years.
   An official at the headquarters of the National League for
Democracy, the main opposition group, said the voting appeared to
be proceeding well.
   ``The election is going smoothly right now,'' said the official,
who requested anonymity, in a telephone interview. ``There is no
problem right now.''
   The country's three most popular opposition leaders were barred
from a role in the campaign, and Western diplomats, human rights
groups and others have expressed concern over widespread arrests,
intimidation of party workers and martial law restrictions.
   A welter of ethnic minority groups and student dissidents are
boycotting the election.
   But on Saturday, rebel sources in Bangkok, Thailand, said they
had called off earlier plans to sabotage polling, even though they
regard the election as fraudulent.
   The ruling military council has pledged that voting will be fair
and free. In recent days, it eased restrictions on campaigning.
   Two years ago, huge street demonstrations in Rangoon were
brutally crushed by military force.
   In public, there were few of the trappings of a Western-style
election campaign. Political posters were banned except at party
headquarters. Government signs urged people to obey the law to
ensure a fair election.
   The Rangoon government closed off the country to tourists and
rejected requests from several human rights and legal organizations
to monitor the election.
   However, last week it granted visas to about 60 journalists from
the United States, Western Europe and elsewhere in Asia.
Journalists were told their coverage would not be restricted,
except for a ban on entering polling stations.
   Results from Rangoon are expected to be released by Monday
morning. But a final tally will not be available for up to three
weeks due to difficulties in obtaining results from remote, rural
areas.
   Predictions about the outcome range from a substantial victory
for the democratic parties to a fractured vote that could lead to
continued military domination.
   Pro-democracy parties hope to return to a liberal multiparty
government, abolished by the military in 1962. The conservative
National Unity Party stands for the status quo.
   Parties have been vague on specific political and economic
issues. Criticism of the military was forbidden during campaigning
and discussion of other topics was restricted as well.
   About 21 million people are eligible to vote in the elections,
choosing 492 parliamentarians from among 2,297 candidates. Voting
has been postponed in seven constituencies due to security and
communications problems.
   Burma's three best-known opposition figures were sidelined
during the campaign.
   Aung San Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero Aung San, was
placed under house arrest last July. Retired Gen. Tin Oo is serving
a three-year jail term. Former Prime Minister Nu, who presided over
chaotic experiment in democracy during the 1950s, is under house
arrest.
   Ms. Suu Kyi and Tin Oo headed the National League for Democracy,
the country's most popular party. It faces off against the
conservative National Unity Party, successor to the pro-military
Burma Socialist Program Party which wielded power for a quarter
century.
   Although 93 parties have entered the contest, only some half
dozen are expected to make any substantial showing.
   These include the League for Democracy and Peace, backed by Nu;
the Union Nationals Democracy Party of Aung Gyi; Thu Wai's
Democracy Party, and the Democratic Front for National
Reconstruction headed by onetime leftist leader Chit Maung.
   The National Unity Party has an efficient and well-financed
machine but is handicapped by the ruinous record of its predecessor
and popular resentment of the military following the bloody events
of 1988.
   The National League for Democracy has been weakened by internal
feuding, the loss of its top leadership and arrests of its
supporters and candidates. Suu Kyi's downfall came when she
publicly criticized Ne Win, Burma's strongman between 1962 and 1988.
   Burma, a nation of 41 million, has suffered from political
turmoil and civil war since its independence from Great Britain in
1948, when many regarded it as a future Asian dynamo.
   A period of flawed democracy, but relative economic prosperity,
was followed by a 1962 coup led by Ne Win and a failed experiment
in mixing military control, socialist economics and international
isolationism.
   The resource-rich country is now among the world's poorest. A
major drain on the economy has been a decades-long war between the
central government and a dozen ethnic minority groups demanding
greater autonomy.

   Columbia will be making the first
shuttle flight in five years devoted entirely to scientific
research when it lifts off this week on a mission to study the
stars, a comet and other celestial matter.
   Launch is set for 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday, two weeks later than
planned because NASA had to replace a bad cooling valve in
Columbia's payload bay.
   ``It looks very good. There have been ups and downs a lot, so
everybody's very excited about the prospects of getting this
mission off,'' mission manager Jack Jones said Friday.
   The countdown for launch began on schedule at 1 a.m. Sunday, a
NASA spokesman said.
   Columbia's payload, a $150 million observatory called Astro,
will provide a much more thorough study of ultraviolet light than
the Hubble Space Telescope, placed in orbit a month ago during the
last shuttle flight. Astro also will probe X-rays, invisible to
Hubble.
   ``We selected Astro to fill in the holes, so to speak,''
explained Ed Weiler, a program scientist for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   It will be the first mission since 1985 to use Spacelab, a
scientific research facility carried in the shuttle's payload bay.
It also will be the first of five Spacelab missions dedicated to a
single subject _ astrophysics.
   The four astronomers on board will operate Astro from the rear
flight deck using Spacelab computers; a pressurized laboratory
module in which astronauts conduct experiments will not be used.
Other Spacelab components will support the 27,450-pound observatory
in the open payload bay.
   It will be the first of 36 shuttle missions to offer ``Lessons
from Space.'' More than 40 middle-school students at two NASA
centers will question the astronauts through a two-way audio and
video link.
   And it will be the first time direct radio communication is made
between a U.S. and Soviet spacecraft. Columbia's astronauts plan to
talk by ham radio to two cosmonauts aboard the Soviet space station
Mir.
   During the nine- to 10-day mission 218 miles above Earth,
Astro's four telescopes will make nearly 1,000 observations of up
to 230 sources of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation, short,
high-energy wavelengths absorbed by the atmosphere.
   At least four observations are planned of Comet Austin, making
what's believed to be its first journey through the solar system.
Halley's Comet would have been studied if Astro had gone up as
planned in March 1986; the Challenger accident two months earlier
postponed the mission.
   Astronaut Samuel Durrance, a research scientist at Johns Hopkins
University, said it's hard to predict what Astro might uncover on
its first outing. But, he added, ``every time we point the
telescopes, it could change the way astronomers think.''
   Unlike Hubble, a $1.5 billion observatory astronomers hope will
explain how and when the universe was created, Astro won't be
focusing on any ``mind-boggling question,'' said astronaut Ronald
Parise, a scientist at Computer Sciences Corp. in Silver Spring, Md.
   The Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, developed by Johns Hopkins
University, will examine ultraviolet wavelengths, some of which
have never been studied in detail. It will observe the hottest
stars and seek traces of helium.
   The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope, developed by NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., will provide wide-angle
photographs of the sky. Images will be recorded on film, which will
be developed following the mission.
   Much of what is seen eventually will be examined in greater
detail by Hubble's telephoto eye.
   ``UIT sees the forest. Hubble studies the trees,'' Weiler said.
   The Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment _ WUPPE
for short, pronounced whoopee _ will measure the brightness and
orientation, or polarization, of ultraviolet light from stars.
   ``Polarization measurements in the ultraviolet have not yet been
done,'' said Arthur Code, the telescope's principal investigator.
``I think we're going to have a lot of interesting data to really
say `Whoopee!'''
   Because of their complexity, the ultraviolet instruments will be
operated by Durrance and Parise _ the first payload specialists
since Challenger exploded _ and mission specialists Robert Parker
and Jeffrey Hoffman. The men will split 12-hour shifts.
   Astro's fourth scientific instrument is the Broad Band X-Ray
Telescope, a Goddard project operated by computer commands sent
from there. It will probe the elusive spectrum of X-rays and track
remnants of exploding stars, or supernovas.
   So as not to disturb the telescopes' pointing systems, Columbia
commander Vance Brand and pilot Guy Gardner will do their treadmill
exercises _ one of several medical experiments _ when no
observations are being made and none of the crew is sleeping.

   Rebel troops advanced to within 30
miles of this capital city Saturday, the closest they have reached
since launching their invasion five months ago, Western diplomatic
sources said.
   In Monrovia, about 500 members of the two tribes that have
largely supported the rebels crowded into the local U.N.
headquarters pleading for protection from attacks by government
forces.
   In another development, Western diplomatic sources and shipping
sources disputed a government claim that its forces had retaken the
strategic port of Buchanan. The sources said rebel forces still
hold the port.
   The government claimed Thursday to have retaken the port, 88
miles southeast of Monrovia, four days after rebels seized it.
   A rebel spokesman said there has been no fighting in Buchanan
since a force of more than 1,000 National Patriotic Front rebels
easily captured the city after most of the government garrison had
fled.
   ``Someone in Monrovia is tooting his horn and continues to lie,
to keep up the charade I suppose,'' said the spokesman, Tom
Woewiyu, in a telephone interview late Saturday from his home in
East Orange, N.J.
   Woewiyu, who spoke with The Associated Press upon returning from
talks with State Department officials in Washington, said the
United States is trying to get rebel and government officials to
negotiate an end to the fighting.
   But the rebels will not open talks unless President Samuel Doe
resigns and surrenders to the rebels to stand trial for ``murder,
genocide, human rights abuses'' and other alleged crimes, Woewiyu
said.
   On Saturday, rebel forces captured a roadblock from government
forces outside the town of Kakata, 30 miles northeast of Monrovia,
and briefly moved into the town before being driven out by
government troops, the diplomatic sources said. They spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The sources also said rebels were seen near the international
airport, 30 miles southeast of the capital of this West African
nation.
   These advances are the closest the rebels have moved toward the
capital since they began their attack on Dec. 24 from the Ivory
Coast in a bid to overthrow Doe.
   The refugees gathered at the U.N. office Saturday were members
of the Gio and Mano tribes that the government considers the main
backers of the rebels. The refugees said many of their friends and
relatives have been killed or detained.
   The government has denied persecuting any groups.
   Last week, the headless bodies of 10 men from the Gio and Mano
tribes were found in Monrovia. Some of the wives of the victims
blamed the government for the killings.
   The United States and other Western governments appealed to
Liberians to end the ethnic violence and called on Doe to make sure
those responsible for the killings were prosecuted.
   International organizations and the U.S. Congress earlier
condemned government forces, saying they had killed hundreds of
civilians in their efforts to defeat the rebels.
   At the U.N. office, Kortoe Dolo stood sobbing.
   ``They killed my brother. They killed him,'' he said. The body
of his brother, Joseph, a delivery man for an electronics company,
was found Friday in a Monrovia creek, Kortoe Dolo said.
   Joseph Dolo's wife, Kema, said two groups of armed soldiers came
to their house Monday night, looted the home, raped her and
abducted Joseph.
   One man at the U.N. headquarters, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he had seen between 300 and 500 young men from the
Gio and Mano tribes being held at the Barclay army training center
in central Monrovia.
   Michael Heyn, chief U.N. representative in Monrovia, said about
500 people from the Gio and Mano tribes were gathered in the U.N.
compound looking for protection. He said talks were under way with
the government to assure their safety.
   About 300 people had asked for help from the U.S. Embassy on
Friday but were turned away.
   The rebels, led by former Doe aide Charles Taylor, say they want
to bring an end to Doe's 10-year rule, which they claim is corrupt.
   However, Taylor has made it clear elections will not be held
immediately if he takes power.
   The rebels have taken control of Nimba County, next to to the
Ivorian and Guinean borders, and have moved south to the Atlantic
Coast.

   The Coast Guard seized a 90-foot
fishing vessel Saturday, searched it for drugs and arrested 12
people after a group was spotted throwing something off a nearby
bridge, authorities said.
   No illegal drugs were found on the trawler, but the Coast Guard
said in a statement it seized the vessel and towed it 50 miles
north to San Francisco Bay for a more extensive search.
   Twelve men, seven on shore and five on the boat, were arrested,
the statement said. All 12 carried identification as Colombians,
but their nationalities had not been confirmed by early Sunday,
Coast Guard Lt. Jim Wierzbicki said.
   About five pounds of marijuana was seized on shore after
investigators combed a 20-mile stretch of coastline for drugs they
suspect were dumped from the boat, the Coast Guard said.
   Three of the 12 people arrested were held for investigation of
drug charges. The others were held for investigation of immigration
violations, the San Mateo County Sheriff's Department said.
   Sheriff's deputies alerted the Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs
Service after spotting several people on California Highway 1
throwing something over a bridge, authorities said.
   The deputies arrested seven people on or near the bridge and
confiscated a bundle containing about five pounds of marijuana. An
inflatable boat was found nearby.
   The Coast Guard initially identified the boat as 50 feet long.

<TEXT>
   Snipers opened fire simultaneously in
different neighborhoods of this port city Sunday, killing nine
people and wounding 25 in the latest outbreak of ethnic-related
violence, police said.
   In the city of Hyderabad, about 150 miles to the north,
thousands of security forces conducted house-to-house searches
after a fierce gunbattle Saturday in the city's poorest
neighborhood left at least 18 people dead and more than 200 wounded.
   Karachi and Hyderabad are the two main cities in Sindh Provice,
where a militant faction of the Mohajir Qami Movement has been
clashing with supporters of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   In Karachi, the province's largest city, gunmen fired at
pedestrians and motor vehicles for about half an hour in different
neighborhoods, police said.
   Authorities refused to say who might be responsible for the
attacks, which began around 6 a.m.
   ``This could only be a well-organized plan,'' said one senior
police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Hyderabad, police and doctors at a local hospital said they
expected the death toll to rise as ambulances picked up bodies that
lined the narrow streets of the old walled city, a winding
congested maze of mud brick houses and shanties.
   The battle, which lasted for more than two hours, forced
authorities to cancel a two-hour curfew break, they said.
   As security troops cordoned off the area and prepared to conduct
house-to-house searches, the fighting spread to other parts of
Hyderabad, the second-largest city in southern Sindh Province.
   According to official count, at least 75 people have been killed
and hundreds more wounded since May 15 in ethnic-related violence
and indiscriminate shootings in this city of 3 million people.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the bloodshed. Police
blame a militant faction of the Mohajir Qami Movement, a small
political party representing descendants of Moslem Indians who
immigrated to Pakistan during the 1947 partition of the
subcontinent.
   The movement is demanding recognition as Pakistan's fifth
nationality, along with the Punjabis, Pathans, Sindhis and Baluch.
   Witnesses said Saturday's gun battle erupted as security forces
moved into the old city, home to about 100,000 people, searching
for weapons.
   The residents, most of them Mohajirs, apparently thought rival
Sindhi nationalists planned to attack and opened fire with
automatic weapons, killing two officers and wounding seven others
before security forces returned fire, witnesses said.
   About 2,000 combat-ready paramilitary units, riot police and
rangers have patrolled the city to try to contain the violence.
Army-supervised curfews have become a way of life.
   Thousands of security force members swept through Hyderabad and
across Sindh on Thursday and Friday and arrested more than 800
suspects. Police said they included members of the Mohajir Qami
Movement and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's
Party.
   In recent years the province has been the site of constant
kidnappings and assassinations. More than 2,000 people have been
killed.
   The worst carnage occurred on Sept. 30 in Hyderabad, when at
least 300 people were killed in a massacre that lasted only 23
minutes. Those suspected of organizing the killings have not been
arrested, fueling fears that the problem is beyond the government's
control.
   In Karachi, the provincial capital, ethnic strife and political
rivalries have turned Pakistan's largest city into a battleground.
The main combatants are Ms. Bhutto's supporters and members of the
Mohajir Qami Movement.
   Opposition politicians have accused Ms. Bhutto's 17-month-old
government of failing to curb the violence in her home province.
   She has said the provincial government has not done enough to
curb the escalating violence and lawlessness. But she accused
neighboring India of stirring up trouble in Sindh and in the
eastern province of Punjab.
   New Delhi blames Pakistan for violent separatist movements in
Indian Punjab and Jammu-Kashmir, India's only state that has a
Moslem majority.

<HEAD>Israeli Supreme Court Rejects Appeal In Nuclear Spy Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court Sunday rejected former
nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu's appeal of his conviction for
treason and espionage resulting from his leaks about Israel's
nuclear weapons program to a London newspaper.
   The three-judge panel announced their decision, but it was read
behind closed doors in keeping with the secrecy surrounding
Vanunu's case since he was arrested in 1986 after disappearing in
London.
   The judges did not make public their reasons for rejecting the
appeal.
   The case received international attention because Vanunu claimed
he had been drugged and kidnapped by Israeli agents just before
publication of articles in The Sunday Times of London based on his
disclosures.
   The newspaper reported that Israel had stockpiled 100 nuclear
weapons and had the ability to make atomic, neutron and hydrogen
bombs. It said this arsenal made Israel the world's sixth largest
nuclear power.
   Israel has never responded directly to allegations about its
nuclear capacity, but has said it will not be the first country to
introduce atomic weapons into the Middle East.
   Israeli officials refused to disclose how Vanunu was brought to
Israel but said no British laws were broken.
   Vanunu's brother, Meir, said Vanunu was lured from London to
Rome by an American woman who promised him sex. In Rome, he was
abducted by Israeli agents and spirited home, Meir said.
   Vanunu, 36, a former technician at Israel's nuclear facility in
Dimona, was convicted in March 1988 and sentenced to 18 years in
prison.
   In his appeal, Vanunu maintained that speaking to a newspaper
does not constitute espionage or treason.
   During his trial, Vanunu testified he made his revelations to
the newspaper to alert the Middle East and the world to the dangers
of nuclear weapons, not for personal gain or out of a desire to
harm his country.
   The maximum punishment for the treason and espionage charges is
life, but the judges took into account Vanunu's indications that he
regretted his actions.
   Vanunu was brought to the Supreme Court Sunday in a white van
with the windows covered so he could not be seen by photographers
or reporters.
   The Supreme Court said it would hear arguments within 30 days on
whether to make public its full decision on Vanunu's appeal.
   Vanunu also has 30 days to appeal the decision to a larger
Supreme Court panel or ask for a reduction in his sentence.
   He has 14 years left to serve since his time in jail before his
conviction was counted as time served. He is jailed in the Ashkelon
Prison in a private cell.
   The three judges who rejected the appeal were Meir Shamgar, Dov
Levin and Eliezer Goldberg.

   Gunmen opened fire on a Soviet military patrol at
Yerevan's main train station early Sunday, and the soldiers
returned fire, killing six of the attackers, the official Tass news
agency said.
   Ten soldiers and a bystander were wounded in the exchange of
fire in the capital of the Caucasus republic Armenia, Tass said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but it was
probably carried out by militants involved in the bitter struggle
between Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan for control of the
Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   In more than two years, several hundred people have been killed
in the violence, and hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee
their homes.
   Soviet soldiers have been sent into both of the republics in an
effort to quell the violence.
   Satenik Haramazyan, a spokeswoman for the Armenian National
Movement political organization, confirmed in a telephone interview
from Yerevan that the shootout had taken place, but she said no
details were available. She said the movement did not know who
attacked the soldiers.
   The movement held a rally on Opera Square in downtown Yerevan on
Sunday afternoon to tell citizens what it knew about the attack,
she said.
   The soldiers were returning early Sunday morning from escorting
a train to Kafan, a city 120 miles southeast of Yerevan in the
corner of the Caucasus republic, when the shooting broke out, Tass
said.
   The soldiers were attacked by a group of up to 15 armed men, it
said.
   Soldiers, ``using their right to use weapons to rebuff an
attack, returned fire. As a result of the exchange of fire, five of
the attackers were killed and two were wounded,'' the news report
said. ``One of the wounded died soon.''
   Tass said three of the 10 soldiers were seriously injured. One
bystander who received bullet wounds in the shootout also was taken
to the hospital, it said, but the report did not say how seriously
he was wounded.
   It also did not say where in the train station the shooting
occurred, and officials at the station could not immediately be
reached for more details.
   The shootout came three days after militants fired on soldiers
at military checkpoints and on patrol in Nagorno-Karabakh, killing
one soldier and wounding four. Tass said one attacker was killed
and six were wounded by soldiers.
   Both Armenian and Azerbaijani militants obtained large supplies
of weapons during fighting between the two sides that occurred in
early January and have rebuffed efforts by officials to take back
many of the guns.
   The dispute between the neighboring republics is over
Nagorno-Karabkh, an enclave located in Azerbaijan but that is
mostly Armenian. In an effort to stop the violence, Moscow took
over administrative control of Nagorno-Karabakh in January 1989,
and Armenians now demand Moscow's relinquish control.
   Armenia is predominantly Christian, while Azerbaijan is mostly
Moslem.

<HEAD>Jews Anguish Over Desecrations, Welcome Shows of Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May has been a month of horror for Europe's Jews,
but also a month of hope and healing.
   A wave of anti-Semitic threats, desecrations and vandalism
across the continent, including the gruesome mutilation of a corpse
at a Jewish cemetery in France, provoked revulsion and reawakened
old fears.
   Yet the same incidents inspired unprecedented displays of
solidarity and reconciliation, suggesting to some Jews that much of
Europe had learned the lessons of the Holocaust.
   Francois Mitterrand, marching with a throng of Parisians
protesting the desecration at Carpentras, became the first
president of postwar France to join a public demonstration.
   King Baudouin became the first Belgian monarch to invite rabbis
to the royal palace, where they heard his words of sympathy and
concern.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East Germany broke with the
ousted Communists, who had denied any role in the Nazi
extermination of 6 million Jews, and pledged to seek reconciliation
with the international Jewish community.
   In Oberammergau, West Germany, the centuries-old Passion Play
about the suffering of Jesus was performed in a rewritten version,
shorn of anti-Semitic passages.
   For some Jews, such gestures were not enough. The American
Jewish Congress took a full-page advertisement Tuesday in the
International Herald Tribune asking Europe's political and
religious leaders to ``speak out, clearly and forthrightly''
against ``the ugly cadences of anti-Semitic slogans and threats.''
   Much of Europe has been plagued with relatively minor
anti-Semitic incidents, notably Nazi-oriented graffiti, but Jews
had not anticipated the shock of Carpentras, home of France's
oldest synagogue.
   Relatives arriving at the cemetery May 10 found 34 tombs
vandalized and the recently buried body of Felix Germon, 81, dug up
and impaled on an umbrella handle.
   Since then, Jewish cemeteries and synagogues have been
desecrated in several other towns in France and in Hungary, East
Berlin, London and Naples, Italy.
   In Romania over the past two weeks, vandals desecrated about 70
graves in three cities and nearly half belonged to Jews. In the
Transylvanian town of Tirgu Mures, 28 Jewish graves were vandalized.
   The Carpentras case has not been solved, despite the efforts of
more than 60 police investigators. Most of those arrested in
connection with other recent desecrations in France have been
``skinheads'' _ youths with close-cropped hair and vaguely fascist
ideologies.
   There has been no proof of involvement by France's extreme-right
National Front, whose brash leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, has been
accused of inciting racist and anti-Semitic feelings.
   Analysts in several European countries suggest the outbreak of
anti-Semitic activity is tied to a broader resentment of immigrants
and fear of economic turmoil.
   ``Historically, Western Europe was a white continent,'' said
Tullia Zevi, a Jewish leader in Italy. ``Now it is becoming
multi-ethnic, like the United States.
   ``This is creating feelings of great insecurity and uneasiness.
There is a resumption of ancient prejudices against Jews, combined
with a new form of racism projected against the new immigrant
minority.''
   Even though most Jewish families in France go back generations,
they suffer their compatriots' worries, said Bob Goldman, European
director for the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League.
   ``The handiest target are the Jews,'' Goldman said in a
telephone interview. ``A lot of people traditionally see them as
foreign and different.''
   In parts of Eastern Europe, growing nationalism has stirred
fears of resurgent anti-Semitism.
   Soccer fans in the Soviet republic of Uzbekistan were said to
have targeted Jewish homes during a rampage May 2. An extreme
nationalist Russian group called Pamyat _ or Memory _ has spread
propaganda blaming Jews for social ills and urging a new ``final
solution.''
   ``The Russian people is not really more anti-Semitic than any
other, but with the constant irritation of shortages and life
getting worse, it's becoming meaner and more irritable,'' said
Jewish activist Natasha Stonov. ``Everything is covered with
gasoline, and all it takes is a match.''
   About 1.5 million Jews live in the Soviet Union and the number
is dropping steadily because of emigration. The rest of Europe has
only that many in all, a fraction of the total before World War II.
   A survey by the Foundation for Combating Anti-Semitism of
Rotterdam, published this week, indicated surprisingly little
evidence of anti-Semitism in Hungary, Romania and even in Poland,
despite the controversy about a Roman Catholic convent at the site
of the Auschwitz death camp.
   Richard Stein, foundation chairman, said the conditions were
worst in France and Italy, where there is extensive anti-Semitism
beneath the surface.
   After Carpentras, many French people invoked images of Nazism's
rise before World War II, but prominent sociologist Pierre-Andre
Taguieff said comparisons with the 1930s ``are catastrophic and
wrong.''
   ``Today, anti-Semites are marginal,'' he wrote in an essay.
``They feel persecuted. They refuse to admit what they are.''
   The mass march by Mitterrand and up to 200,000 compatriots, many
of them non-Jews wearing yellow Stars of David, ``would be
unthinkable'' in the 1930s, he said.
   France's chief rabbi, Joseph Sitruk, sounded a similar note at
Carpentras, when he led more than 10,000 people of all faiths in a
service at the cemetery the weekend after the desecration.
   ``France is not anti-Semitic,'' the rabbi preached. ``What a
beautiful lesson is given here this morning. I dare to say it _
what happiness. What happiness to see France identifying with our
suffering.''

   Jean-Marie Le Pen has been accused of
anti-Semitism and xenophobia in his crusade to keep France French.
The press calls him a ``devil,'' but Le Pen doesn't care.
   ``If I told you it gives me pleasure, would you be surprised?''
he says with a grin.
   After 30 years of battle in the public arena, Le Pen refuses to
yield now.
   ``I'm a man with a mission,'' he said. Alluding to death
threats, he added: ``If I fall, I will have accomplished it.''
   Le Pen and his National Front fear ``colonization'' by
foreigners. They want to expel immigrants and enact new
anti-immigration laws.
   To the accusations of racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia, Le
Pen replies that he is simply a patriot who says in public what
other people think in private.
   After the discovery May 10 of the desecration of the Jewish
cemetery in Carpentras and mutilation of a corpse, Interior
Minister Pierre Joxe accused Le Pen of fostering hate. Le Pen was
present only in effigy at a huge protest march in Paris that
attracted all the main political parties.
   ``I am Carpentras'' read a sign on the effigy.
   ``It leaves me rather cold,'' Le Pen said, settling into a chair
in the study of his home in St. Cloud, a suburb of Paris.
   ``I have the calm of an old soldier. I've often seen the whites
of the enemy's eyes.''
   For him, the enemy is the political establishment supported by
the media, which he claims echo its lies. He says the desecration
at Carpentras was a plot carried out by professionals to discredit
him.
   ``There is one thing I'm sure of: It is that I'm not guilty and
the National Front is not guilty,'' Le Pen said. ``I don't know who
did it, but I know who didn't do it.''
   Like a television preacher, Le Pen knows how to pump a crowd. He
struts, cajoles and rages, tempering his street-smart edge with
quotes from Pascal or Latin citations. He is silver-haired,
physically imposing, and even detractors acknowledge he has
charisma.
   The 61-year-old Breton, whom the French press calls the
``beast'' or the ``devil,'' thrives on controversy.
   ``Democracy is a debate, a combat of ideas,'' he said recently.
``It's not a parade of arm-chair philosophers with good
intentions.''
   On a bookshelf sits a portrait of Le Pen wearing the black
bandanna he once affected to cover the eye he lost in a street
fight defending a parliamentary deputy.
   A former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire who fought in
Indochina and Algeria, he now fights many of his battles in court.
   Le Pen, a deputy in the European Parliament, has been convicted
three times and fined for making remarks about Jews or the
Holocaust, but he denies being racist or anti-Semitic. He says he
has won 30 slander suits against the press.
   ``Me? Racist? It's a gag, a gag,'' he boomed. ``But I'm not for
the melting pot. I'm for the defense of one's culture. I'd despair
if I found the culture of Brooklyn in France.''
   Of Jews, he said: ``If they are French, there's no problem; I'm
not anti-Semitic.''
   On Wednesday, a court fined Le Pen for saying in 1987 that the
Nazi gas chambers were a ``detail of World War II history.''
   The Justice Ministry has succeeded in getting Le Pen's
parliamentary immunity lifted to prosecute him for two other
remarks: a play on words in 1988 linking the name of a Cabinet
minister to Nazi crematory ovens and his assertion last year that
the ``Jewish international'' was partly responsible for the
``anti-national spirit.''
   ``Who is charged to say what one can and cannot say in a free
country?'' he said.
   Le Pen founded the National Front in 1972 and remained obscure
until the party broke through in 1984, getting 11 percent of the
vote in European Parliament elections. He startled France in 1988
by winning 14 percent in the first round of presidential voting.
   Politicians of all sorts have scrambled to either outmaneuver or
accommodate him, or to woo his followers with tough talk on
immigration.
   By getting the law on voter representation changed, the
government of former Premier Jacques Chirac managed to reduce the
National Front's parliamentary seats from 33 to one.
   Since Carpentras, which set off a wave of anti-Semitic acts, Le
Pen is being denounced with greater vigor than ever.
   He is ``a man dangerous for national unity, for civil peace,''
declared Chirac, now a conservative leader.
   He ``boos the name of Gen. de Gaulle and applauds that of the
Nazi Schoenhuber,'' Chirac said. Franz Schoenhuber, a former member
of the Waffen SS, is a far-right colleague of Le Pen in the
European Parliament.
   At least six cities, including La Trinite-Sur-Mer, his hometown
in Brittany, recently denied Le Pen and his followers meeting space.
   Le Pen compares himself to a fire chief racing across town,
sirens blaring, in time to contain the blaze.
   ``Everybody says, `See that racist fire. It's fire chief Le Pen
who is guilty. You can even see all the noise he makes with his big
horn,''' he said. Racism is not increasing in France, Le Pen said,
``but there is increasing fear tied to insecurity toward foreigners
and nobody dares say so. Everyone is afraid to be called a racist.''
   He read from newspaper clippings of attacks on French citizens
by people with Arab names.
   ``Of course, I'm afraid,'' he said. ``If Europe is Europe, it's
because it has resisted'' conquest by outsiders.
   Le Pen plans to run for president again in 1995.
   Citing audience ratings after his recent appearance on a
political talk show, he said: ``I had 13 percent ... and Brigitte
Bardot had just 5.4 percent'' on a competing channel.

   Hundreds of police officers used
chain saws on Sunday to cut through barricades and evict more than
100 squatters who had occupied an abandoned office complex for four
years.
   No violence was reported during the eviction, which occurred one
day after the squatters left the complex for several hours to
ransack nearby shops and fight running street battles with riot
police.
   The squatters rioted Saturday to protest a court ruling ordering
them out of the former Wolters-Noordhof publishing complex by
Monday.
   They hurled firebombs and bricks at police after ransacking two
cafes and a nearby office. Eleven rioters were reported arrested.
   Piles of charred refuse from Saturday's disturbance littered the
streets around the charred walls of the brick complex where the
eviction occurred.

art museum, police said.
   The robbery occurred about 11 a.m., as many of the 240 antique

the Louvre des Antiquaires _ were opening for abbreviated Sunday
business hours.
   The masked gunmen surprised the owner of one of the jewelry
shops as he arrived for work, completed the robbery within a few
minutes and fled without firing shots. Police were investigating.

   A Filipino airman opened fire with an
assault rifle on mourners attending a wake for a colleague in the
northern Philippines, killing seven people and wounding 12, air
force officials said Sunday.
   Officials said they had not determined the motive for Saturday's
attack, which occurred in the town of Bacarra, 250 miles north of
Manila.
   Authorities identified the suspect in the slayings as Carmelo
Dugay, 36, who was assigned to a radar station in the northern
province of Ilocos Norte.
   Dugay had been resting in a room after guard duty, but emerged
with an M-16 assault rifle and opened fire on the crowd of mourners
in a house, officials said. The gunman fled after the attack.
   Col. Avelino Abiol, an air force spokesman, said the dead
included a retired lieutenant, five civilians and an airman who
died later at a hospital. Among the wounded were two airmen and 10
civilians, Abiol said.

   The Jones family is back together. But it
took three decades of searching and hoping.
   ``It's all so fresh and today is the day,'' Jim Ahlers, who was
born James Thomas Jones, said Saturday at the family reunion in
Callaway Park. ``We made it.''
   In 1960, his mother was arrested for child neglect, and he and
his 10 brothers and sisters were taken to a children's home in
Hamilton, Ohio. There they were separated according to age and sex,
and later they were adopted.
   Ralph Jones began his search when he left the orphanage in 1961.
   ``Now they're all grown up,'' he said. ``I never thought I'd see
the day.''
   Most of the siblings _ their mother has died _ had already been
reunited before Saturday's reunion. But two of the boys remained
unfound.
   ``I remember all of them,'' said LaVern Lang, the oldest of the
siblings. ``Up until Jimmy found us this year we thought that would
be it. We thought we would never find Dennis or Jimmy.''
   But Jimmy Ahlers, 34, found his family this month, and one week
later the family found the youngest sibling, Dennis Brown, who was
an infant at the time of the separation.
   ``I don't have words for it. My feelings are running wild. It's
starting to sink in a little bit,'' Brown said.
   A faded photograph of the children was the only reminder some of
them had of their earlier lives.
   Ahlers said the search isn't over. ``My grandmother is alive and
holding me in the original photo. I want to meet her,'' he said.

   The people who believe animals should be
treated more humanely are about to stage their first national
event, a ``March for the Animals'' intended to demonstrate that
their movement is becoming a mainstream cause.
   ``We will march peacefully and non-violently to show America
that we are reasonable and rational people and not a bunch of
lunatics,'' says one of the organizers, Peter Linck, executive
director of the National Alliance for Animal Legislation.
   ``Our purpose is to unify ourselves and educate the country and
raise the nation's consciousness,'' he said.
   The march, from the Ellipse behind the White House to the
Capitol, is scheduled to take place June 10.
   Linck said the animal protection movement is the country's
fastest-growing cause. The Humane Society of the United States, an
old-line group which describes itself as ``moderate,'' has seen its
membership increase fourfold _ from 325,000 in 1985 to 1.2 million
today.
   Another group, Friends of Animals, has grown quickly too _ from
60,000 members three years ago to double that number _ but
president Priscilla Feral said more significant is the way the
concerns of animal lovers are being shared by people not involved
in the movement.
   ``It is absolutely normal now to hear people talking about
whether to buy a fur coat, or take the kids to the circus or about
the campaign to save the dolphins,'' Ms. Feral said in an interview
recently.
   She said the growth of the 1975 Friends of the Animals tuna
boycott was a factor in the decision in April by the makers of
StarKist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea brands to stop buying
tuna captured with fishing nets that also trap, and kill, dolphins.
   Linck said thousands of participants from all 50 states and at
least half a dozen foreign countries are expected at the march. At
30, Linck is a veteran of the animal protection movement. In
college, he switched from a pre-veterinarian course of study to law
so he could lobby for animal welfare issues.
   He is co-chairman of the demonstration with Tom Regan, author of
``The Case for Animal Rights.'' The march is sponsored by hundreds
of local and national groups.
   The animal protection movement represents divergent views _ some
activists are meat-eaters and some, like Linck, decline even to
wear shoes made of leather. Some believe the use of animals in
biomedical research is acceptable and some do not.
   ``But a reverence for life would be their common concern,'' said
Linck.
   He said some in the movement believe that all creatures, even
insects, ``have an inherent right to live and should be respected
to the highest degree possible, while others would draw the line at
mammals.''
   The organizers have lined up a number of pro-animal celebrities
to address the crowd _ ranging from cartoonist Berke Breathed to
professional basketball player James Donaldson _ and anticipate
hearing from a number of sympathetic politicians too. The political
speakers have not been announced because they are still being
recruited.
   One prominent speaker will be Australian philosopher Peter
Singer, author of ``Animal Liberation,'' who is considered ``the
father of the modern animal rights movement.''
   Another speaker will be Mayor Bill Stirling of Aspen, Colo.,
backer of a proposal to ban the sale of fur in Aspen. Voters
rejected the ban, by a 2-1 margin, in February, but supporters
claimed a victory by bringing national attention to the issue.
   The march's sponsoring organizations have a variety of goals _
more humane farm practices; abolishing hunting as a sport; limiting
the use of animals for testing medications, cosmetics and other
products; halting fur sales; banning the use of the steel leg hold
trap, described as a cruel way to catch wild animals for their
furs; and having pets spayed and neutered to prevent overpopulation.
   On the day following their demonstration, the marchers plan to
lobby Congress in support of 60 animal protection bills that have
been introduced, but will concentrate on three proposed measures.
   One would prohibit the use of an animal test that measures
pesticides, cosmetics, drugs, weedkillers and household products
for toxicity; opponents say the test is unnecessary and causes
suffering or death for up to 5 million animals a year.
   Another would prohibit the practice of confining veal calves in
small crates and the practice of feeding them a diet deficient in
solid food and iron to produce white meat.
   A third would prohibit hunting and trapping of wildlife for
sport or commercial purposes on national wildlife refuges.

   The remains of five American soldieres
killed more than 35 years ago in the Korean War and held since then
by North Korea will begin their final journey home on Memorial Day.
   A U.S. congressional delegation arrived in Seoul Sunday to
arrange for the first return of U.S. Korean War dead from Communist
North Korea since 1954.
   The return of the remains is widely seen as a gesture by North
Korea to improve relations with the United States. The two
countries do not have diplomatic relations.
   The eight-man U.S. delegation, led by Rep. G.V. ``Sonny''
Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of the House Veterans Affairs
Committee, will travel Monday to the truce village of Panmunjom to
receive the remains. Panmunjom is in the Demilitarized Zone
separating South Korea and North Korea.
   The congressmen arrived on a special flight that landed at an
airport outside Seoul. Reporters were not allowed to cover their
arrival.
   U.S. military officials in Seoul said Montgomery would receive
the remains after signing a document with a North Korean lawmaker.
   The delegation will then turn the remains over to the U.S.
military, which plans to send them to a forensic laboratory in
Honolulu for identification.
   The U.S. Defense Department said the North Koreans identified
two of the dead as Army 1st Lt. Jack J. Saunders, 27, of Ogden,
Utah, and Army Cpl. Arthur Leo Seaton, 20, whose family lived in
Chester, Pa.
   Both soldiers were listed as missing in action in February 1951,
the Pentagon said.
   North Korean diplomats assigned to the United Nations told The
Associated Press Saturday that a pilot also was believed to be
among the dead.
   There were large-scale returns of remains in 1953 and 1954.
Then, after years of no returns, the North Koreans announced May 14
that they would turn over the remains of five Americans on Memorial
Day.
   Ho Jong, North Korea's deputy permanent representative at its
U.N. mission, said the Communist government in Pyongyang was
prepared to discuss returning more.
   He said the move was an ``eloquent illustration'' of North
Korea's willingness to ``settle pending issues with the U.S.
government in a good way.''
   The American-led United Nations Command in Seoul said more than
9,000 U.N. Command military personnel were unaccounted for after
the war ended, including 8,177 Americans and soldiers from Canada,
Australia and England.
   Official figures show that 33,629 U.S. soldiers were killed and
103,284 wounded in the war.
   The U.N. Command includes the United States and 15 other nations
that fought on South Korea's side after North Korean forces invaded
across the 38th parallel dividing the Korean Peninsula on June 25,
1950.
   The three-year conflict left more than 1 million people dead and
another 1 million wounded.
   North Korea acknowledged for the first time in January 1988 that
it was still holding the remains of U.N. Command war dead.
   The North Koreans agreed to begin negotiations on returning the
remains a few weeks later, but then canceled the talks after the
United States accused North Korea of sponsoring terrorism in
connection with the bombing of a South Korean civilian airliner.
   The Korean Air jet disappeared off the coast of Burma in
November 1987, and all 115 people aboard the plane died.
   A woman who was among the passengers on an early leg of the
flight was arrested later and testified that she had planted a time
bomb on the plane on orders from North Korean leaders who wanted to
scare people away from the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. North
Korea denied the allegations.
   Other members of the congressional delegation are Democrats
Frank McCloskey of Indiana, James Bilbray of Nevada, Bob Traxler of
Michigan and Ben Campbell of Colorado, and Republicans Bob Stump of
Arizona, Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania and Gerald Solomon of New York.

<HEAD>Half New Drugs Had Unanticipated Side Effects</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The faster new drugs are rushed to market the
more likely they will produce severe unanticipated side effects,
congressional auditors conclude in a report saying half the new
products introduced over a decade had to be relabeled with new
warnings.
   Certain classes of drugs _ heart, anti-inflammatory,
psychopharmacologic, dermatologic and antibiotic _ were most likely
to have serious post-approval reactions, the General Accounting
Office said in a report prepared for release Sunday.
   Especially ``troubling,'' said the GAO, was that drugs for use
by children were twice as likely to have reports of serious
unanticipated reactions after their approval by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The GAO reviewed label changes for the 209 new drugs that were
approved from 1976 to 1985 to determine the seriousness of
additional risks identified after the drugs were approved.
   The study found that of the 198 drugs for which data could be
found, 102, or 51.5 percent, had reports of serious adverse
reactions. Those reactions were defined as leading to
hospitalization or increased length of hospitalization, or
resulting in severe or permanent disability or death.
   Six of the drugs were withdrawn from the market and labels on
the rest were changed to add major warnings or precautions for
their use, or to restrict for whom the drug should be prescribed,
the report said.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., who requested the report, said
shortcomings in the FDA's drug approval process may be responsible
for serious adverse reactions.
   ``Serious and unanticipated adverse reactions are certainly a
risk we must accept when FDA shortens the review time for
experimental drugs to treat immediately life-threatening illnesses
such as AIDS and cancer,'' Weiss said.
   But for less serious diseases, ``this may be too high a price to
pay for shorter approval times,'' he said.
   ``By failing to systematically use evidence of post-approval
risks linked to drugs already on the market, FDA may be overlooking
problems with similar drugs under review at the agency but not yet
approved,'' Weiss said.
   The FDA, in comments included in the report, said the GAO's
review was ``not methodologically sound'' and would ``unnecessarily
alarm consumers.''
   ``Even the most extensive pre-market testing cannot cover all
possible circumstances,'' said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit. ``Testing
perhaps 3,000 people over months or years won't always identify a
rare reaction unfolding over a long time or affecting perhaps just
one person in 10,000.''
   He said that is why FDA monitors reports of adverse drug
reactions after a product is marketed.
   It can take as long as eight to 10 years for a drug to move
through the FDA approval process, beginning when a company applies
for permission to test a new product in humans.
   The first studies test the drug's safety in a small number of
people. Later, the drug is tested for effectiveness. If after the
FDA reviews all the data _ which on average takes 29 months,
according to GAO _ the drug may be approved for marketing.
   Because the pre-approval testing involves small numbers of
patients, more information about the drug usually surfaces after
the drug is approved and distributed widely. The FDA monitors
reports of adverse reactions and sometimes requires post-approval
research as a condition of approval.
   The time between a drug's approval and a post-marketing label
change is five years or more, the GAO report said.
   The congressional auditors recommended that FDA establish a
systematic procedure to assure that serious reactions discovered
after a drug's approval are evaluated to identify possible risks
with similar drugs not yet on the market.

<HEAD>U.S. Financing of Mexican Drug Strike Teams Urged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three members of the House Armed Services
Committee want the Bush administration to finance the Mexican
government's mobile strike forces that sweep in on drug traffickers
at landing strips.
   After inspecting drug war command centers, the lawmakers said in
a report released Sunday that officials have largely succeeded in
combatting the flow of drugs across the Mexican border via aircraft.
   ``We have forced the drug industry to look for new routes and
new methods,'' the lawmakers said.
   Radar is capable of tracking aircraft carrying drugs to landing
sites in northern Mexico but enforcement officials are unable to
get there before the drugs are dispersed.
   Mexico ``now has a handful of mobile strike forces located in
northern Mexico designed expressly to do what we are suggesting _
move in swiftly for the kill at the landing sites,'' the lawmakers
said.
   They suggested that the United States provide the funds for the
Mexican strike teams. No specific totals were provided.
   The report, in the form of a May 23 letter to House Armed
Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., was written by Reps. Nicholas
Mavroules, D-Mass., who chairs the panel's investigations
subcommittee, Lane Evans, D-Ill., and Jim McCrery, R-La.
   The lawmakers said an alternative to U.S. financing of Mexican
strike teams would be increasing the U.S. Border Patrol, which now
has 3,900 officers.
   However, ``even a doubling or tripling of the manpower along the
border would be unlikely to make a huge dent in the volume of drugs
crossing the border,'' they said.

   The Soviet Union's popularity has soared in the
United States since the last superpower summit, and Americans
increasingly support U.S. military cuts to reflect the lessened
tensions, a survey found.
   As President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev prepare
to meet in Washington this week, the national Media
General-Associated Press poll found both leaders continuing to
command great popularity among Americans.
   Gorbachev slipped only slightly from his overall rating in a
similar poll before the last summit in December, even though a
third of the respondents now think less highly of him because of
his crackdown on Lithuania.
   Most striking in the new survey were growing expressions of good
will toward America's old Cold War foe. Forty-one percent of the
respondents said they held favorable views of the Soviet Union,
well up from 24 percent last November and 15 percent in a 1987
survey.
   Fourteen percent of the respondents in the new poll had
unfavorable opinions of the Soviet Union, and 41 percent had a
neutral view.
   In another measure of growing trust, a relatively low 29 percent
believed the Soviets seek to dominate the world. That fear factor
stood at 35 percent last November and 50 percent in a CBS News-New
York Times poll a year ago.
   The new Media General-AP survey was conducted by telephone May
11-20 among a random sample of 1,143 adults across the country. It
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The summit starts Wednesday amid continuing upheaval in the
communist world. Gorbachev is pushing reforms of the Soviet system
while struggling to contain independence movements in some of the
Soviet republics. His Eastern European allies, once viewed as
puppets, largely have abandoned communism.
   Possibly because of Gorbachev's difficulties, the survey found
some sense that the initiative in superpower relations has shifted
to Bush. In November, 41 percent said Gorbachev was doing more than
Bush to reduce tensions, but in the new survey that fell to 33
percent.
   At the same time, those saying Bush was doing more to ease
tensions rose from 29 percent in November to 38 percent now. The
rest were unsure.
   Similarly, 54 percent said Bush was doing enough to encourage
Soviet reforms _ up from 46 percent in November _ and 33 percent
said he was being too cautious, down from 40 percent in November.
Again the rest were unsure.
   In view of the lessened tensions, 50 percent in the new survey
said the United States should reduce its military spending
significantly, up from 41 percent who favored such cuts last
November.
   Additionally, nearly four in 10 said the United States should
immediately begin reducing its forces in Western Europe. While
still a minority, that was up from 25 percent in November.
   The poll found some lingering suspicion of the Soviets. Half
said the Soviet Union cannot be trusted to live up to arms control
agreements _ about the same as in November, but down from 61
percent a year ago.
   On Lithuania, 46 percent said the breakaway Baltic republic
should back off from its claim of independence from the Soviet
Union and hold negotiations, while 31 percent said it should push
its claim. The rest had no opinion.
   But there was support for gradual independence for the Baltic
states. Fifty-seven percent favored the actions of Lithuania and
Latvia, which have claimed independence, while just 8 percent
favored the actions of Estonia, which wants independence but has
not formally claimed it.
   Gorbachev has responded to Lithuania's claim by denying it
shipments of oil and other supplies. While 34 percent said the
embargo has made them think less highly of Gorbachev, 48 percent
said it had not changed their view.
   Overall, 63 percent had a favorable impression of Gorbachev and
69 percent held a favorable view of Bush. As in earlier surveys,
Gorbachev outpolled Bush, 79-68 percent, among the best-educated
respondents, those with postgraduate schooling.
   An overwhelming 75 percent of all respondents approved of the
way Bush is handling relations with the Soviet Union.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews May 11-20 with 1,143 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 percentage points of the
result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The
error margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions.
   Here are the questions and responses in this poll; because of
rounding, sums may not total 100. Results from a November 1989 poll
in which the same questions were asked are provided for comparison.

   A stunt plane crashed in flames while
trying a rollover maneuver during an air show, killing the pilot,
as 1,000 stunned spectators watched, authorities said.
   Macon County Coroner Hal Bentley said Albert Butler, 28, of
Houston was killed in the crash Saturday evening at the annual
Memorial Day air show. There were no other injuries.
   ``It shocked the crowd pretty good, especially when the fire
covered that big area,'' Bentley said. Spectators were about 300
yards from the crash site.
   Butler, a member of Negro Airmen International, was ``trying to
attempt a rollover, a trick maneuver,'' Bentley said. ``He was kind
of low and it just went down.''
   Federal Aviation Administration investigators were at the scene
Sunday, he said.
   Witnesses said two planes were in the air when one came in low
over the airfield, did a roll and dropped. The pilot of the second
plane was not even aware the other one had crashed until after he
landed, Bentley said.
   The annual air show is held as a tribute to black pilots who
were trained at Tuskegee during World War II, when the Air Force
was segregated. Pilots from different chapters of the Negro Airmen
International take part in the show each year, said Assistant
Police Chief John Meadows.

   The economy is in shambles. Republics erupt in
explosive ethnic quarrels; others try to secede. Comrades squabble
over what is to be done _ and do nothing.
   Yet Mikhail S. Gorbachev not only survives but is championed
around the world as a hero of epic proportion.
   In the five years of his reign, he has ended the Cold War, taken
the first steps toward nuclear disarmament, pulled his army out of
Afghanistan and begun the withdrawal of Soviet troops from foreign
soil. Tens of millions of his countrymen and millions more in the
former Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe have been freed
from totalitarian rule.
   ``I think,'' observed a Soviet teacher who recently returned
from her first trip to the West, ``he is more popular abroad than
he is at home.''
   Two polls released Sunday lent support to that assertion. A
Washington Post-ABC News poll said 73 percent of 1,526 American
adults surveyed last week said they had a ``favorable impression''
of Gorbachev, with 25 percent responding ``unfavorable.'' A Media
General-Associated Press survey, taken May 11-20 among 1,143 adults
nationwide, found that 63 percent had a favorable impression of the
Soviet leader. Both polls had a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points.
   At home, however, Gorbachev is no hero to many Soviets
understandably preoccupied with the issues of everyday life: the
food and ordinary goods they can't buy; the critical housing
shortage that denies them simple comfort and privacy; the rising
crime rate and ethnic strife that make them fearful for their
families and meager possessions.
   He has pleaded futilely with Lithuanian officials not to declare
their independence and has been jeered _ to his face _ by
protestors comparing him to Nicolae Ceausescu, the Stalinist
dictator of Romania executed in December in the midst of a popular
uprising.
   But perhaps most frightening in a society so wrenched by this
century's calamitous events is the uncertainty of what is to come.
That fear of change is at once his toughest obstacle and his best
protection.
   ``Perestroika depends on public opinion, and that's
conservative,'' the president told reporters this month in a frank
acknowledgement that he's been unable so far to initiate a
long-awaited transition to a state-regulated market economy.
   The Associated Press learned that Gorbachev's key advisers were
actively working on a plan to institute a Polish-style ``shock
therapy:'' announcement of a virtual overnight conversion of the
economic system by freeing most prices and currency controls and
letting market forces revamp the economy. It is said that Poland
shortened the painful transition period of high unemployment and
runaway inflation by moving swiftly after the fall of the communist
government there.
   But the Soviet plan to try something similar leaked to the
press, touching off an outcry from a fearful public. Gorbachev and
other top officials later denied they would attempt such a radical
move.
   Last week, Gorbachev's advisers approved a milder reform plan _
which envisions a doubling of food prices, an 82 percent rise in
energy costs and an average 43 percent rise in retail prices _ but
only if the public supports it in a national referendum.
   The announcement of the food price hikes set off a wave of panic
buying _ prompting Moscow officials to announce plans to restrict
sales of many food and consumer products to cut down on hoarding.
   Absent public support, First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov told
a news conference, ``perhaps we will have to resort to round-table
discussions'' to devise a plan that would be supported.
   He said the government was not proposing ``shock-therapy''
changes because such reforms could throw 40 million people out of
work and ``would lead the country to the edge of an economic
crash.''
   Some Soviet citizens reacted with apathy to the announcement,
others with emotion. A 65-year-old woman said, ``I have been
suffering all my life.'' Another woman said the reforms would make
food so expensive that ``I'll have to put my teeth away on a
shelf.''
   Gorbachev ``is in a tough position'' as head of the Communist
Party, said Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, rector of the Higher Party
School in Moscow. ``In the party, everyone _ from the right wing,
from the left wing _ is criticizing him.''
   But Shostakovsky, a leading member of the Democratic Platform
group that is pushing within the party for faster reform, added
that as president, Gorbachev retains the support of a broad
centrist element in the country, despite the sharp criticism of him
from the more radical wings of his own party.
   A peasant by birth and a product of the Communist system,
Gorbachev has demonstrated repeatedly he is quite capable of taking
one position based on traditional ideology, then abandoning it in
the face of popular discontent. He did that in being converted to
legalization of private ownership of factories, the ``means of
production'' classical Marxists insisted were tools of exploitation
unless held by the state.
   It sometimes even appears he has helped fuel the public's demand
for change. After stubbornly resisting calls for a multiparty
system, he accepted the idea, then gave at least tacit support to a
huge demonstration through downtown Moscow to increase pressure on
the party leadership to go along.
   While calling constantly for perestroika, or economic
restructuring, Gorbachev often defines the debate with radicals on
both sides opposed to him. He thus makes adoption of his reform
proposal appear to be the centrist position.
   Through adroit political maneuver, Gorbachev now sits
comfortably atop both the party and the government. His adversaries
on the right, led by Yegor K. Ligachev, a spokesman for doctrinaire
communism, no longer hold positions of power. His most vocal critic
on the left, Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, is waging a
campaign for the presidency of the Russian republic, which would
give him a new soapbox but little administrative authority over the
vast territory that forms the largest of the union's 15 constituent
republics.
   After giving in to popular demands that the Communist Party
surrender its monopoly, Gorbachev led a drive this spring to
legalize competing parties and simultaneously establish a strong
presidency, a post he then handily won for himself in a clear
demonstration of political clout.
   As the party inevitably loses its command over daily life,
Gorbachev can continue to rule from his new power base at the top
of the government.
   The president and his supporters are fond of saying there is no
alternative to perestroika. For now, at least, the same might be
said of perestroika's champion.
   ``The country can't do without Gorbachev now,'' said Lidya
Sharlai, who raises pigs on a collective farm outside Moscow. ``In
a few years, perhaps. But right now, there is no one else.''

   President Bush joined in the singing
of ``Let There Be Peace on Earth'' at a Memorial Day service after
church Sunday and voiced hope that this week's summit will bring
that goal closer.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, worshipped with 150 others at the
First Congregational Church and afterwards joined parishioners in
praying for peace at an outdoor monument to a local son, Terry
Drown, killed in Vietnam in 1969.
   Bush was relaxing this weekend at his oceanfront home here as he
prepares to welcome Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the
White House on Thursday.
   Asked if he had a message to the nation on this weekend when
America's war dead are remembered, the president said, ``Simply
respect for those that gave their lives'' and ``recognition that
... the world's getting smaller.''
   ``I think everybody, regardless of their faith and background,
aspires to see a world of peace. ... That's what this little
service is about and certainly that's what this summit coming up
with Gorbachev is about,'' he said.
   Inside the spare but striking white clapboard church, the Rev.
Patricia Adams spoke of the changes Bush alluded to.
   ``Our world is getting smaller every year,'' said the minister.
``We have begun to learn that we can live together despite our
differences. We don't have to be clones. Different ideologies,
different ideas, different dreams can co-exist quite happily.''
   The Bushes, who are Episcopalians, have attended the
Congregational church before, usually during visits here in the
spring, winter or fall. The Episcopal church, St. Ann's, has not
yet opened for the summer.
   Every pew was packed on a brilliant, sunny morning, and two fans
on the 18-foot-high ceiling did little to keep the room from
becoming warm. After weeks of rain, the coastal area has basked in
three bright days since Bush arrived Friday.
   The minister called it ``the first official weekend of summer''
and offered a word of welcome to ``the Washington branch of our
family.''
   Bush stood to introduce Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
and a few others in his party.
   When the minister solicited prayers for the sick, Bush's son,
Marvin, mentioned Lee Atwater, the ailing Republican party chairman.
   A massive mahogany organ with pipes painted gold stretched
almost to the ceiling at the front of the church. The six-member
choir sang hymns and patriotic airs.
   The entire congregation marched outside to the strains of ``O
Beautiful for Spacious Skies'' to the monument across the street.
   Marshall Bush, 3, sat at her grandparents' feet beside the
granite marker, dangling her foot skyward for Mrs. Bush to tie a
shoe during the singing of ``Let There Be Peace on Earth.''
   Then Bush shook hands all around and headed for his limousine,
telling the minister, ``I think we'll push on and clear the
roadway.''

   Before it became a Monday holiday, Memorial
Day was celebrated on May 30, the day Americans paid homage to
those killed in the nation's wars.
   This year, May 30 also is the day Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives
in Washington. The following day, the leaders of the United States
and the Soviet Union, the two great superpowers that have
confronted each other through four decades of Cold War, will sit
together to talk about peace.
   Veterans say the coincidence is all right by them.
   ``Perhaps in meeting just after Memorial Day, both of the heads
of our governments will think about what war means, and what the
legacy of war is, and that's primarily the loss of human life,''
said Mary Stout, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America. ``In
fact, it may be a very appropriate time for them to meet.''
   Mylio Kraja, executive director of the American Legion, agreed.
   ``We would wish our president and the world itself to come to a
successful summit, as we have stood from our inception for peace in
the world,'' Kraja said last week.
   In Westwood, Mass., a town of 13,000 where 83 veterans of the
American Revolutionary War are buried, Jim Sullivan, the city
director of veterans' service, said ``During World War II, both
American and Russian soldiers fought for the same cause. Now after,
gosh, almost 50 years, we are finally getting back to the point
where, hopefully, we can all be friends again.''

<HEAD>Medals of Honor Considered for Black Heroes of World Wars</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two years and another administration ago, the
Pentagon promised to study the records of black soldiers to
determine why none of them received the Medal of Honor for valor
during World Wars I and II.
   Since then, George Bush was elected president and the two
congressmen who were bird-dogging the Pentagon on the subject are
gone: Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, died in a plane crash and Joseph
DioGuardi, R-N.Y., was defeated for re-election.
   But the probe has not been scuttled, a Pentagon spokesman said
last week.
   Neither has it been finished.
   ``The study is still going on and the reason it's taking so long
is most of these black soldiers were with French units,'' Maj. Doug
Hart, a Defense Department spokesman, said in an interview.
   The French records of one World War I unit became available only
in February, Hart said. Military researchers are also looking at
World War II records of three black Navy seamen who received the
Distinguished Service Cross, he said.
   Hart said the investigations will probably be completed later
this summer.
   That pleases Leroy Ramsey, an Albany, N.Y., historian who six
years ago began a lonely quest to correct what he feels is a great
injustice.
   ``I'm kind of perturbed that it's taken so long but I am pleased
that the Pentagon agreed to give it a full review,'' Ramsey said in
an interview last week.
   A black World War II veteran himself, Ramsey was stunned to
discover while researching a book that not one of the 1.5 million
black Americans who served in the world wars received the nation's
highest military decoration for bravery.
   Blacks were excluded from U.S. combat units in both world wars.
But more than a few were cited for bravery, Ramsey learned upon
examining the records of servicemen awarded the Distinguished
Service Cross and the French Croix de Guerre.
   Ramsey then read the nation's more than 1,200 Medal of Honor
citations and concluded that at least one black World War I soldier
and one black World War II seaman had records strong enough to
warrant the highest honor.
   ``I didn't want this to be token because these guys were
black,'' Ramsey stressed.
   The two he selected were Army Sgt. Henry Johnson of Albany,
N.Y., and Seaman Dorrie Miller of Waco, Texas. Both are dead.
   By 1987, Ramsey had succeeded in interesting DioGuardi and
Leland in his cause. The two sponsored legislation to award
posthumous Medals of Honor to Johnson and Miller but the Pentagon
opposed the bill because it singled out two individuals.
   In October 1988, then Defense-Secretary Frank Carlucci announced
the Army would review the records of black World War I heroes and
said he would ask the Navy about the feasibility of doing the same
with blacks in World War II.
   Hart said the Pentagon is now looking at the records of Johnson
and all the men in his unit. Miller's record also is under review,
along with those of Seamen William Cook Pinckney and Leonard Roy
Harmon, Hart said.
   Johnson, who fought with the French army in World War I, killed
four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captured a
stockpile of weapons, all despite severe wounds. He was awarded the
Croix de Guerre, France's highest military honor, but was never
cited by the United States. He died in 1930.
   Miller was a mess steward on the USS West Virginia when it was
attacked at Pearl Harbor. While the battleship was being shelled,
he helped moved its wounded captain from the ship's bridge, then
returned to man a machine gun. Miller received a Distinguished
Service Cross and a warship was named for him in 1971. He was
killed in a torpedo attack in 1943.
   Harmon, of Texas, was a mess attendant aboard the USS San
Francisco during a battle with the Japanese near the Solomon
Islands in 1942. He deliberately exposed himself to hostile gunfire
in order to protect a wounded shipmate and was killed, according to
his citation.
   Pinckney, of South Carolina, was a cook on the USS Enterprise in
a battle with the Japanese near the Santa Cruz Islands in 1942.
During heavy bombing, Pinckney carried a comrade to safety before
pushing his way out of a burning compartment.

   Those chemicals that damage the ozone layer
high in the sky may prove useful to scientists studying the deep
oceans.
   Chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs, are human-made chemicals
used as refrigerants and in industrial and cosmetic uses.
   They have caused concern in recent years because they can damage
the ozone layer, a region of the stratosphere that protects Earth
from damaging solar radiation.
   But some CFCs also are absorbed into the water at the surface of
the oceans, and scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration are tracking those chemicals to learn more about
ocean circulation and sea-air interaction.
   ``The release of CFCs into the environment during the past 40
years has, inadvertently, provided oceanographers with a tool to
study the rates by which compounds can be transferred from surface
water into the deep ocean,'' reports John Bullister of NOAA's
Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle.
   These studies can help scientists learn more about the ability
of the ocean to absorb other pollutants and problem gases, such as
the increasing carbon dioxide that many consider a threat that
could lead to global warming.
   The ability of the oceans, which cover the majority of the
planet, to absorb such gases has not been well understood by
scientists.
   Since CFCs have no natural sources, and have come into common
use only in the last 40 years, scientists can track their presence
in various ocean layers. They use the concentration of CFCs to help
determine rates of mixing in the water, deep sea currents and
various deep temperature layers.
   The fact that CFCs do not break down readily, a characteristic
that makes them a threat in the atmosphere, increases their
usefulness as tracers in the ocean.
   That longevity allows CFCs in the air to rise high into the
stratosphere where they interact with sunlight and damage the
protective layer of ozone. Ozone screens out ultraviolet light and,
if it is reduced, the result could be more cases of skin cancer and
other skin and eye damage as well as threats to crops and livestock.
   CFCs are no longer used as aerosol propellants in the United
States and international efforts are under way to reduce their uses
worldwide.

<TEXT>
   Hikers have discovered the body of a man
who went for a walk in subfreezing temperatures in 1983, and left
his wife a note saying he intended to walk until he died.
   The remains of Cloyd Ferrall Howard were found in a remote
Jefferson County area Thursday by two hikers exploring for mountain
caverns in the Lost Creek Wilderness area.
   Howard was 33 when he left the note for his wife on Jan. 29,
1983. Searches failed to turn up any sign of the missing man until
last week.
   Howard's skeleton was still partially clad in jeans and hiking
boots. He was identified Saturday through dental charts.
   The skeleton still had on heavy-duty hiking boots, jeans, a
jacket and a digital watch. He had 80 cents in his jeans pocket.
   ``We had a good idea it was Howard because none of the change in
his pocket was dated past 1982,'' said Lt. Dennis Potter of the
Jefferson County Sheriff's Department.
   ``We were amazed at the place where he was found. You could look
out over this ledge and see this beautiful panoramic vista. He was
laying there, fully skeletonized, on his back in a very peaceful
repose inside the overhang area,'' he said.
   Authorities said he hiked four miles from where he left his
vehicle at a trailhead. Temperatures were well below freezing that
day, and several inches of snow covered the area.
   ``He could not have even survived the night the way he was
dressed,'' Potter said.
   ``We found no evidence that he built a fire, found no matches or
anything else for survival,'' he said. ``He just climbed up there,
laid down and died, probably from exposure.''

   More than 2,000 troops will be
deployed throughout Manila to cope with what the national police
commander on Sunday called a ``breakdown in law and order'' in this
turbulent capital.
   In Washington, the State Department warned that Americans
traveling in the Philippines face an increased risk of terrorism as
the two countries prepare for a new round of negotiations on U.S.
military bases in the island nation.
   A statement issued by the military said Maj. Gen. Cesar
Nazareno, chief of the Philippine Constabulary, told commanders a
unit of about 2,000 troops would be deployed in Manila to curb a
spate of bombings and killings.
   Officials said that by Monday the troops would be stationed near
key government installations to respond quickly to any incident.
   ``It seems that we now have a breakdown in law and order,''
Nazareno was quoted as saying.
   The move follows escalating violence blamed on both Communist
rebels and right-wing military dissidents, responsible for last
December's bloody coup attempt in which at least 113 people died
and more than 600 were wounded.
   In the latest incident, suspected Communist rebels killed a
police sergeant Sunday in the city's Kalookan district.
   Last Monday, powerful bombs were defused outside two bank
headquarters in the financial district, Makati. Two days later, a
Filipino colonel and four other people were killed in an ambush on
the city's busiest thoroughfare.
   On Thursday, a bomb injured a Marine near armed forces
headquarters, and Friday two police were ambushed and slain.
   Police blame the two ambushes on Communist rebels and the bombs
on military renegades.
   On Friday, the Revolutionary Alliance of the Masses, a military
group that purportedly led the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt, threatened to
kill banker Domingo Lee for alleged ``crimes against the people.''
   Lee's bank, PhilBanking Corp., was the target of one of the
bombs defused on Monday. Lee is a leading figure in the
Filipino-Chinese business community and a strong supporter of
President Corazon Aquino.
   In a statement Sunday, the shadowy Young Officers' Union,
another military group linked to the December coup attempt, did not
explicitly deny the mutineers were behind the bombings.
   But the Union also implied the bombs were planted by government
supporters to justify extending Mrs. Aquino's emergency powers,
which expire next month.
   Congress granted the special powers after the December coup
attempt, and last week the Cabinet decided to ask Congress to
extend some of them for six months.
   Some of the violence has been directed at Americans, and the
U.S. State Department said attacks could increase as the countries
prepare for more talks on extending the lease on six U.S. military
bases.
   U.S. and Philippine negotiators finished the first round of
talks May 18, and more are expected by July.
   ``During this period, Communist elements in the Philippines are
likely to expand their current terrorism campaign beyond U.S.
officials and active duty U.S. servicemen to include retired
personnel and the places they frequent,'' the State Department said
in a statement issued in Washington.
   The U.S. Embassy estimates there are about 140,000 Americans in
the Philippines, including 40,000 troops, military dependents and
Defense Department civilians at the six bases.
   In the statement, the State Department said most of the major
tourist destinations and most urban areas were generally free of
civil disorder.
   But it said: ``Because of criminal activities, travelers should
exercise caution at night in the downtown entertainment districts
of major cities and should avoid travel to remote mountainous
areas.''
   A number of U.S. businesses and offices are in Manila's
entertainment district, including the U.S. Embassy and offices of
The Associated Press.
   Eight Americans have been slain in politically motivated
violence since April 1989. They include two U.S. airmen slain by
Communist rebels May 13 on the eve of the first round of base talks.

   A Romanian set himself on fire Sunday
in front of the U.S. Embassy, and doctors battled to save his life.
   Hospital sources said the 31-year-old man, Miroi Dimitru, was in
a critical condition with second- and third-degree burns over 35
percent of his body.
   The official news agency MTI said the man's motives were not
known.
   But hospital sources said Dumitru told hospital staff members
that he arrived from Romania on Saturday.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
claimed that a Romanian-speaking man in a car kidnapped him earlier
Sunday and tried to return him to Romania. Dimitru said he escaped
when the car stopped at a gas station.
   The sources said Dimitru told them that when he reached the
vicinity of the U.S. Embassy he asked for some gasoline from a man
working on his car, doused himself and set himself on fire. A
marine guard at the U.S. Embassy said the man did not try to enter
the compound.

<HEAD>Evidence Of 39-State Prostitution Ring Comes to Light After Man's
Death</HEAD>

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's deputy resigned and an Ohio
restaurateur killed himself after their names turned up on a list
of a male prostitution ring that authorities say involved customers
from 39 states.
   Indianapolis police also have fielded phone calls from men who
fear they might be on the list of patrons and prostitutes
investigators found in the car of James W. Dayton, the ring's
suspected organizer who died after having sex with a prospective
escort.
   No arrests have been made as police and prosecutors study the
reams of evidence confiscated from Dayton's car and his
Indianapolis apartment. But arrests could come as early as this
week, investigators said Friday.
   Those who agree to cooperate with the investigation could be
offered plea bargains, said J. Michael Loomis, the Marion County
deputy prosecutor heading the investigation.
   But many of the about 400 people investigators believe solicited
escorts from the ring never will be identified, for the list
carries many aliases or just first names.
   Dayton, a 44-year-old computer technician who worked for the
Naval Avionics Center, is believed to have built a network of more
than 100 prostitutes through messages on computer billboards and
solicited patrons by advertising two escort services in homosexual
publications.
   The prostitutes, many of whom were bodybuilders, earned fees
ranging from $150 to $500. Dayton earned a cut of nearly 25
percent, said police spokesman Andrew Stoner.
   Dayton died of a heart attack March 16 in a Tiffin, Ohio, inn
after engaging in sex with a man who wanted to join the ring as a
prostitute, authorities said.
   In his car trunk, investigators found 140 pages of
computer-generated job applications for the escort services as well
as names, addresses, telephone numbers and nude pictures.
   Richard Gates, a Marion County sheriff's deputy, resigned May 11
after being confronted with news that his name had turned up on
Dayton's list of clients and employees. A 25-year veteran of the
sheriff's department, he chose to retire with his pension rather
than face an internal affairs investigation.
   Another person whose name turned up was Chris Berman, owner of a
popular restaurant in the Toledo suburb of Walbridge. Berman
committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his garage a day
after a reporter called to ask about his possible involvement with
the prostitution ring.
   Police believe some evidence might have been removed from
Dayton's apartment, but Stoner said the missing evidence has had no
significant effect on the investigation.
   Dayton's records show customers from 39 states, Canada, Guam and
South Korea, but most of the activity was concentrated in Indiana,
Ohio and Michigan.
   Indianapolis police were tipped to Dayton's activities in July
1986, but were never able to infiltrate the ring. Dayton insisted
that prospective prostitutes have sex with him or provide explicit
photographs and body measurements, and police were unwilling to
compromise an officer or informant, Stoner said.
   Dayton's only arrest came in September 1987 after he fondled an
undercover Marion County sheriff's deputy, Stoner said. He pleaded
guilty to indecent exposure and paid $150 in fines.
   Investigators believe the ring ceased operating with Dayton's
death.
   Authorities have asked that patrons and prostitutes involved in
the ring to call the police vice squad.
   ``It's been an overwhelming success,'' Loomis said, estimating
that 50 calls had been received by Friday, some from lawyers who
represent more than one participant.
   Marion County Prosecutor Stephen Goldsmith has publicly urged
all participants in the ring to be tested for the AIDS virus.
   A medical card found in Dayton's possession indicates he tested
negative for the virus. But police say one of the participants has
tested positive for the deadly disease.
   Goldsmith has come under fire for saying acquired immune
deficiency syndrome testing may become a condition for immunity
from prosecution.
   ``He's way out of his bailiwick if he think's someone's going to
come in and take an HIV test under threat of prosecution,'' said
Stan Berg, publisher of the homosexual publication The New Works
News, which circulates 7,000 copies primarily in the Midwest.
   Loomis countered: ``We're attempting as best we can to separate
law enforcement issues from health issues. We strongly urge and
encourage persons to be tested. Clearly, we would prefer that
persons voluntarily submit to HIV screening.''
   Berg said he knows a few men who were involved in Dayton's
operation as escorts, and he questioned the scope of the operation
that authorities have presented.
   ``A lot of it was just older men who wanted to take a pretty
`boy' out to dinner,'' Berg said. ``Some have indicated there was
surprisingly little sex involved.''

<HEAD>Dinkins Calls For Unity; Activists For More Heat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins, calm and determined, hoped
to inspire the same mood in the city with two speeches championing
racial harmony. But some critics say bigotry can be fought only
with anger.
   ``It's time to come together to create a wave of unity so
powerful it can wash away the hate,'' the mayor told a packed
sanctuary at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine last Tuesday.
   Three black activists were quick to reject his call, ridiculing
Dinkins and the idea of racial harmony. ``We intend not to turn the
thermostat down, but to turn it up,'' said attorney C. Vernon Mason.
   He was joined by Alton H. Maddox, another attorney, and the Rev.
Al Sharpton, who has led angry protesters through Bensonhurst, the
neighborhood in Brooklyn where a black teen was killed by a mob of
whites.
   ``Any black man who advocates racial harmony is out of his
mind,'' said Maddox.
   The city's first black mayor and the three activists embrace
radically different approaches in handling the social injustices
afflicting minorities in the city. But each has a role to play in
ultimately improving race relations, says a specialist in urban
studies.
   ``You need a combination of militancy and moderation,'' said
William Kornblum, director of the Center for Social Research at the
City University Graduate Center in Manhattan.
   ``If it's all moderation, there is no change,'' he said. ``If
it's all militancy, there will be no understanding.''
   Wilbert Tatum, publisher of the Amsterdam News, says Mason,
Maddox and Sharpton have raised the consciousness of the city.
People now realize they have no choice but to confront racism,
Tatum said, and will therefore listen to the reasonable voice of
Dinkins.
   ``If Mason, Maddox and Sharpton did not exist, David Dinkins
could not exist,'' Tatum said.
   Racial tensions in the city reached a crescendo with the trial
of two young white men charged with killing 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins. The relief that swept the city with Joseph Fama's murder
conviction turned to rage with the acquittal of Keith Mondello a
day later on murder and manslaughter charges.
   Demonstrators shouting ``No justice, no peace!'' ran through the
streets after the Mondello verdict came in, knocking over trash
cans and attacking reporters and television news vans.
   And there may be more to come. Six more youths face charges in
Hawkins' Aug. 23 murder; five of them, including John Vento, 21,
are charged with murder. Vento's trial is scheduled for June 11.
   The city also has been unsettled by a black boycott of two
Korean-American grocers that began after a Haitian-American woman
accused a shopowner of assaulting her in an argument over a
dollar's worth of fruit.
   The boycott heated up about the same time a white professor gave
a lecture at Long Island University's Brooklyn campus in which he
said that whites are intellectually superior to blacks. The result
was a near riot.
   While all this was going on, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist
Jimmy Breslin was suspended for two weeks by Newsday executives for
hurling racist and sexist slurs at an Asian-American co-worker.
   Those incidents sparked Dinkins' address Tuesday call for
harmony, his second speech in less than two weeks condemning
racism. On May 11, in a locally televised speech, he appealed to
New Yorkers for racial unity.
   ``We will never allow any group or any person to turn to
violence or the threat of violence to intimidate others, no matter
how legitimate their anger or frustration may be,'' the mayor said.
   On Thursday, Dinkins proposed a record $27.9 billion budget,
including a $780,000 increase for the city's Human Rights
Commission. The money will help fund teams to respond to racial,
ethnic, religious or gender bias incidents.
   ``You can't put everything on David Dinkins to change the city.
People must change themselves,'' said Peter Williams, a project
associate at the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers
College.
   ``But he can take steps to change the problems _ stronger
standards for institutions that discriminate against people of
color and discriminatory lending by banks are examples of things he
could be addressing.''

   A pro-democracy opposition party whose
leaders are being held by the military government took an early
lead Sunday in Burma's first multiparty elections in 30 years.
   Supporters of the National League for Democracy cheered and
danced in the streets as the first official results were announced
on state radio, giving the party victories in three of the 492
races for seats in the national legislature.
   The election was called by the military government, which seized
power in September 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide
pro-democracy uprising.
   The military rulers have said they will hand over power to a
civilian government. But over the past 20 months the government has
imprisoned and intimidated political opponents.
   Sunday's election proceeded without any reports of violence or
military shows of force. However, the government imposed a curfew
on the capital after 10 hours of voting and four hours of
hand-counting ballots.
   The early returns indicated the opposition League was winning by
wide margins. In the capital's Seikan constituency, it took 60
percent of the vote to 35 percent for the pro-military National
Unity Party, official Rangoon Radio said.
   The League said it was certain it had won 16 victories in
Rangoon's 61 constituencies. Preliminary indications from other
major cities also suggested voters had rejected the pro-military
party, it said.
   Results from the countryside, home to about 70 percent of
Burma's 41 million people, were less predictable. Some analysts
said the pro-military party could make a strong showing there.
   A final tally could take up to three weeks, officials said.
   Initial reports from polling officials indicated the turnout in
major cities ranged from 60 percent to 70 percent.
   In interviews in the capital, older Burmese generally declined
to say how they had voted, but younger voters uniformly said they
had cast ballots for one of the pro-democracy opposition parties.
   The military government has detained two leaders of the National
League for Democracy. Aung San Suu Kyi, the highly popular daughter
of independence hero Aung San, is under house arrest, and Tin Oo is
in prison.
   Former civilian Prime Minister Nu also is under house arrest.
   Although the government rejected requests for foreign official
observers at the polls, there was no sign of interference or
intimidation at Rangoon voting stations visited by foreign
correspondents.
   Sources in other major cities also said there were no problems.
   ``The voting went smoothly and well all over the country,''
Rangoon Radio said as it announced the first official results.
   ``As far as I can see, it's very fair,'' said a young woman
teacher as she emerged from a polling area.
   Some ethnic minority rebel and student dissident groups
boycotted Sunday's elections. However, rebel sources in Bangkok
said on Saturday that the rebels had called off earlier plans to
sabotage polling.
   The 492 parliamentary seats were contested by 2,297 candidates
from 93 parties. Only half a dozen of the parties were expected to
make a significant showing, however.
   The military government has said it will hand over power after
the new legislature approves a constitution and new elections for a
civilian government are held under the document's provisions.
   Asked if he would allow a civilian government to run the
country, junta leader Gen. Saw Maung said Sunday: ``I have already
abided by my promise.''
   ``I will transfer power according to the law,'' he said on
emerging from a central Rangoon polling booth.
   Before the curfew was imposed, National League for Democracy
backers celebrated their early wins at party headquarters. People
cheered and danced in the street in front of the rundown party
building.
   ``I'm so happy,'' one young party member said. ``I'm not
surprised though, because we knew the people would vote for us,
this is what we we expected.''
   Myint U, an official of the League, said if the party won the
election, it would seek the release of political prisoners. He said
about 400 party members were imprisoned along with other dissidents.
   Many foreign human rights and legal organizations have accused
the Rangoon leaders of widespread human rights abuses. The
government has denied the allegations.
   The military has held power in Burma since a 1962 coup by Gen.
Ne Win, whose ``Burmese Way to Socialism'' program included
military control, ruinous socialist economics and isolation from
the rest of the world.
   Although endowed with rich natural resources, Burma is now among
the world's poorest nations.
   The military rulers have liberalized the economy and expanded
commercial dealing with foreign countries while maintaining tight
internal political control.

   Mary Henderson's body was under attack by a
bacteria that kills up to 100,000 Americans each year, and her
family gathered at her hospital bedside as she began slipping
toward death.
   But her life was saved because one of her physicians had heard
about an experimental drug for Henderson's infection during a
lunchtime conversation earlier that day. Federal officials gave
quick approval for her to be given the drug, and a month later,
she's at home.
   ``I'm still kind of in a stupor, walking around my apartment,''
Henderson, 55, of Santa Monica, said Thursday in a telephone
interview. ``I'm saying `Hey, I made it.'''
   Her doctors said the bacteria infection, called Gram-negative
sepsis, developed after Henderson's immune system was weakened by
chemotherapy for cancer of the lymph system.
   ``She was on the brink of death. There is no doubt about that,''
said Dr. George Fareed. It was Fareed who told Dr. Peter Boasberg,
one of Henderson's physicians, about the sepsis treatment being
tested by Xoma Corp., where Fareed is director of new product
development.
   When Henderson's body began failing the afternoon of April 23,
Boasberg called Fareed at his Santa Monica office to ask if he
could get hold of the drug they had discussed at lunchtime,
Xomen-E5.
   A hurried round of phone calls followed to Xoma's Berkeley
headquarters and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, seeking a
waiver to administer the experimental drug under a ``compassionate
use'' exemption, Fareed said.
   Final approvals were given within four hours, and arrangements
made for a Xoma employee to fly the drug to Santa Monica.
   ``It was incredible,'' said another of Henderson's doctors, Dr.
Leonard Fromer. ``She was on death's doorstep, and she got this
(drug) at midnight and four hours later every objective sign of her
condition was improved.
   ``I fully believe she would have died without the drug.''
   The infection-causing bacteria _ called Gram-negative because
cells don't hold a dye in a laboratory staining procedure _
conventionally have been attacked with antibiotics.
   But that treatment, while killing the bacteria, fails to attack
toxins the organism produces. Of 200,000 Gram-negative sepsis cases
each year in the United States, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000
result in death, Fareed said.
   The new drug from Xoma, and one developed by another company,
Centocor Inc. of Malvern, Pa., bind to the toxins and block their
effect.
   Xoma and Centocor, which manufactures Centoxin, are seeking FDA
approval for the drugs.
   Dr. Harvey Rubin, an infectious disease specialist at the
University of Pennsylvania who was involved in trials of Centoxin,
called the new treatment exciting but said it requires further
study.
   ``The clinical trials were quite small. We have to wait for many
more people in wider trials before we can definitely say this is
unequivocally efficacious,'' he said Friday.
   Dr. Elizabeth Ziegler, a professor of medicine in the infectious
diseases division of the University of California, San Diego,
worked on the original testing of the antibody used in Centoxin and
on clinical trials.
   She also said the new approach is promising, but stressed that
it is an adjunct to traditional treatment and that not all sepsis
deaths can be prevented.
   Henderson still has a medical battle to fight: She is undergoing
tests that could lead to a bone marrow procedure aimed at wiping
out her cancer.
   But she said her recovery from Gram-negative sepsis has given
her hope.
   ``I feel very confident with Drs. Boasberg and Fromer,'' she
said. ``It's reaffirming that they are committed to their patients.
It's a great feeling at this point in my life.''

<TEXT>
   An assistant attorney general garbed in
traditional cap and gown gave a graduation speech that ended with
him balanced upside down atop four chairs.
   It wasn't his part-time work as a lawyer that got Sam Kilbourn
the gig as commencement speaker Saturday at Gould Academy. It was
his work as a professional clown, one who describes his brand of
performing as a cross between pantomime, clowning and acrobatics he
dubs ``panto-clowning.''
   ``It's an alternative to a talking head at a podium,'' said
Kilbourn.
   The impression he wanted to get across in his talk-less
satirization of a graduation speech was that the students should
challenge themselves, take risks and believe in themselves, he said.
   The idea for the offbeat commencement address came from the
western Maine prep school's headmaster, William D. Klough III.
   Some of this weekend's 64 Gould graduates said the performance
made an impression.
   ``It was pretty incredible. Didn't ever know what to expect. It
kept us on our toes,'' said Kevin Davis, class valedictorian.
   Kilbourn, 46, graduated from Yale University in 1965, where he
was captain of the gymnastics club. He earned his law degree in
1971 from Cornell, where he was a Law Review editor.
   But by 1979, Kilbourn had quit his full-time job at a law firm
and gone into clowning professionally.
   For the past few years he's been working with a five-man
traveling performance team called the Wright Bros.
   ``We don't have an easily identifiable niche. We in the industry
call it new vaudeville,'' Kilbourn said.
   The Wright Bros. takes up most of his time, anywhere from 40 to
90 hours a week. But Kilbourn said he decided in 1988 to return to
law part-time in order make extra money.
   A frequent lecturer at continuing legal education seminars for
lawyers and paralegal professionals, Kilbourn works three or four
days a week in the Natural Resources Division at the Attorney
General's Office in Augusta, concentrating on real estate cases.

   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) _ Chevy Chase has come a long way
since his pratfall days at ``Saturday Night Live'' _ he's received
an honorary degree from his alma mater and given a commencement
address.
   Chase, a 1968 graduate of Bard College, was honored Saturday at
the 700-student college 90 miles north of New York City.
   Chase recalled that he appeared in his first movie at Bard,
``and believe it or not, it began with me pratfalling over a
suitcase.''
   He gave some parting words of tongue-in-cheek wisdom to the
Class of 1990:
   ``Avoid fatty foods. Avoid smoking, drugs, Bensonhurst, the Gaza
Strip, bungi jumping, humorless people, bad music, fashion, weight
training and hair care products.
   ``Oh, and one more thing,'' Chase added. ``Never tell the truth.
Embellish, patronize, pander, use hyperbole, braggadocio, mollify,
but never actually tell the truth. ... Your job is to act. Keep the
dream alive. Also, never call me.''

   Priscilla Presley has put on the market
her country French-style house in this southern California retreat
northwest of Los Angeles. Asking price: $2.6 million.
   The house, on a wooded 2-acre plot, was built in 1964 in
Montecito's ``Golden Quadrangle,'' one of the community's most
exclusive neighborhoods. It has three bedrooms and three baths in
about 2,600 square feet and a barn has been converted into a guest
cottage.
   Ms. Presley bought the property in 1981, eight years after her
divorce from Elvis Presley and four years after his death, but has
rarely spent time there, said Linda Fareed, who has the listing
through Alexander Velto Real Estate.
   ``She's been so busy on `Dallas' and doing other things,'' said
Ms. Fareed.
   Besides launching her own perfume line in March and serving as
co-executive producer of the now canceled ``Elvis'' series on
ABC-TV, she starred as Jenna Wade during the 1987-88 season of
television's ``Dallas.''

   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has
received a commitment to education award and seven students won
scholarships in honor of Christa C. McAuliffe, the teacher who died
on the space shuttle Challenger.
   Sununu was given the ``I Touched the Future'' award Saturday for
his contributions and commitment to education in society, said Paul
S. Weller, president of Framingham State College.
   Weller also gave Sununu the Christa Corrigan McAuliffe medallion
at a dinner arranged to raise money for a fund named after the late
schoolteacher.
   McAuliffe and six astronauts died Jan. 28, 1986, when Challenger
exploded shortly after liftoff. McAuliffe was chosen in a national
search among teachers to become the first public citizen to travel
into space.
   The McAuliffe scholarships arte for students attending or
wishing to attend Framingham State, a small college about 20 miles
west of Boston.
   Sununu, the former governor of McAuliffe's home state of New
Hampshire, said politicians and parents need to stop focusing on
how a school looks or its condition, and concentrate on whether
children are being taught.
   ``The intangibles are the critical aspects of the changing needs
of education,'' he said. ``Teaching is not only the most noble, but
the most critical (career) for this nation.''

   Actress Jill St. John and actor
Robert Wagner have been married after a lengthy relationship.
   Miss St. John, whose films include ``Diamonds are Forever,'' was
previously married and divorced three times.
   Wagner was married twice to the late actress Natalie Wood. On
Nov. 29, 1981, Miss Wood accidentally slipped from the couple's
yacht and drowned off Santa Catalina Island at the age of 43.
   Wagner, 60, and Miss St. John, 49, have been together for eight
years, said publicist Alan Nierob. They were married Saturday in a
private ceremony at Wagner's home.
   Katherine Wagner, 26, Wagner's daughter from his marriage to
Marian Marshall, served as maid-of-honor. Natasha Gregson, 19, Miss
Wood's daughter from her marriage to Richard Gregson, and Courtney
Brooke Wagner, 16, daughter of Miss Wood and Wagner, were
bridesmaids. Also attending were Wagner's mother and sister and
Miss St. John's mother, Nierob said.

<HEAD>Baker Reiterates U.S. Support of U.N. Investigation in West Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Sunday the United States still supports having the United Nations
investigate the treatment of Palestinians in Israel's occupied
territories.
   Baker said the United States supports an investigation conducted
in the West Bank and Gaza at the behest of the U.N.
secretary-general. But he drew a distinction between a mission
dispatched by the secretary-general and a mission sent by the U.N.
Security Council.
   ``I hope that the Arab leadership and I hope that the government
of Israel will both support the idea of sending an investigative
mission from the secretary-general to the territories and report
back,'' he said.
   ``That is something the United States will support, and I hope
that we can see the parties come together on that,'' Baker said.
   Baker's comments on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program came
the day after the United States blocked an attempt by the Security
Council to send a mission to the occupied territories.
   Arab leaders were angered by the U.S. move at the Security
Council meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, and they claimed Baker had
reneged on a promise.
   The United States objected to the investigative mission after
Israel refused to accept any team sent by the Security Council.
   Baker said Arabs ``must have misunderstood'' what they thought
was his earlier backing of a Security Council investigative team.
   Arab countries this week called for U.N. protection of
Palestinians living in the occupied territories. At least 15
Palestinians have been killed in clashes with Israeli defense
forces in the past week.
   On Saturday, kidnappers holding two American hostages in Lebanon
blamed the United States for the massacre of seven Palestinian
workers in Israel on May 20. Israeli officials have said the
accused gunman, a former soldier, apparently was deranged.
   In a statement issued Saturday in Beirut, the Organization of
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, vowed to make the
United States and Israel ``pay the price'' for the killings.
However, the group did not threaten hostages Jesse Turner and Allan
Steen.
   Meantime, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir reiterated his
opposition to any U.N. peace-keeping forces or other observers in
the occupied territories.
   ``I don't think we need peace-keeping forces for having peace,''
he said. ``Our experience is that such forces are not bringing
peace. They are causing tensions and not peace.
   ``We don't need foreign military men to police the country, the
area. We need peaceful talks. That's all.''

   Crews worked Sunday to unload fuel tanks on
a 90-foot fishing boat seized in a drug raid off the coast so the
boat could be searched for hidden compartments, the Coast Guard
said.
   No contraband was immediately found on the boat, which was
seized Saturday off Half Moon Bay and towed to San Francisco after
San Mateo County sheriff's deputies spotted a suspected
drug-smuggling operation along the coast, according to a Coast
Guard statement.
   Twelve men _ seven on shore and five aboard the vessel _ were
arrested, and federal and state officials combed a 20-mile stretch
of coastline for drugs they suspect were dumped from the trawler.
   Five pounds of marijuana was seized on shore near Pescadero,
about 30 miles south of San Francisco, said sheriff's Sgt. Mike
Peck.
   The arrests and seizure came after sheriff's deputies spotted
several people on state Highway 1 near the coast throwing something
from a bridge, authorities said.
   An inflatable boat was found nearby.
   Three of the 12 are being held on investigation of drug charges,
and the others were under investigation by federal immigration
authorities, the sheriff's department said. Those arrested were
believed to be foreign nationals, but their nationality was not
immediately known, authorities said.

   Hundreds of people dropped
flowers into the North Sea over the weekend during a solemn
memorial for the 158 people who died in a ferry fire last month
that probably was set by an arsonist.
   The Scandinavian Star was engulfed in flames midway on its
overnight run from Oslo, Norway to Frederikshavn, Denmark. Most of
the victims were Norwegians.
   About 300 people, including survivors and relatives of people
who died in the disaster, lined the rail of this ship during a
sunset memorial service on Saturday.
   The two-day memorial voyage was arranged by a survivors' support
group, and clergymen and psychologists helped comfort those
mourning the people who died aboard the Scandinavian Star ferry
when a fire raced through it on April 7.
   ``I have been here before. A month and half ago when, like all
of us in our own ways, I was marked for life,'' said survivor Grete
Holen.
   As the King of Scandinavia cut its motors and stopped in the
North Sea where the disaster occurred, she said: ``We are bound
together by a meaningless tragedy. All of us have had a piece of us
ripped out forever.''
   An American entertainer, Ruth E. Rome, 27, of East Lansing,
Mich., was among the casualties.
   Police believe the fire was set. A Dane with a history of mental
disorders and pyromania died in the inferno, leading police to
theorize that he may have been the arsonist. The investigation is
continuing.
   ``I think of all the people who died so needlessly. I think of
the seconds and millimeters we were from dying,'' said Tore
Netteland, as the car and passenger ferry sailed the route of the
Scandinavian Star.
   Some returned to the site of the tragedy to help cope with grief
or fear. Others said they came to say farewell.
   Ms. Holen expressed anger about safety rules that allowed the
Scandinavian Star to sail. The ferry, registered under a flag of
convenience, was unprepared to handle a disaster, investigators say.
   A marine inquiry heard a catalog of safety omissions and
blunders that may have helped the fire spread and hinder rescue
operations. The Norwegian captain was found to have abandoned the
ship while passengers remained alive on board.
   ``Our private sorrow is one thing. The public side of this is
that we want the world to know that there is a lesson in this
tragedy,'' Ms. Holen said, calling for tougher safety regulations.
   A commission of representatives from Norway, Denmark and Sweden
ordered regulations tightened for ferry traffic in Scandinavian
waters.

<HEAD>Violence in Sindh Province Leaves More Than 80 Dead, 275 Hurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HYDERABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pakistan's troubled Sindh province
exploded in violence Sunday that left at least 82 people dead and
more than 275 hurt in two cities, authorities and witnesses said.
   In Hyderabad, in southern Sindh, security forces on Sunday shot
and killed 60 people and wounded more than 200 who defied a
13-day-old curfew imposed to curb ethnic violence, police and
witnesses said.
   In the province's capital, Karachi, 150 miles to the south, at
least 22 people were killed and 75 others wounded in sniper attacks
Sunday, officials said. Authorities clamped curfews on three of the
most violent districts.
   Much of the province has been hit in recent years by a wave of
kidnappings, assassinations and sniper attacks that have left more
than 2,000 people dead.
   The violence in Hyderabad broke out Sunday after Moslem leaders
used loudspeakers at neighborhood mosques to call residents into
the streets.
   Hundreds of people, many clutching the Moslem holy book, the
Koran, poured out of their homes, police and witnesses said.
   The shooting set off gun battles between residents and troops
patrolling the city, police and witnesses said, and the army moved
in to restore order.
   Opposition politicians in Parliament demanded the dismissal of
provincial government officials and called for a state of emergency
to be declared in Sindh, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's home
province.
   In the past two weeks, gun battles have brought life to a
standstill for Hyderabad's 3 million residents.
   The curfew violators in Hyderabad on Sunday were demanding
restoration of water and power, and trying to get food. Security
forces warned people to go back inside, and opened fire when the
warnings were ignored, witnesses said.
   Ambulances rushed victims to a nearby hospital, but doctors said
they could not treat them all.
   As word of the shooting spread, witnesses said, furious
residents began taking potshots at paramilitary troops, riot police
and rangers.
   ``People were trying to break through police barricades and
shooting from their rooftops,'' said one witness, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``The situation got totally out of
control.''
   After five hours, witnesses said, the army moved in.
   Earlier Sunday in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, snipers
launched a series of attacks beginning early in the morning, firing
at pedestrians and vehicles. Authorities refused to say who might
be responsible.
   Most shops and businesses closed when the shooting started, they
said.
   No one has claimed responsibility, but police frequently blame
violence on a militant faction of the Mohajir Qami Movement, or
MQM, a small political party representing descendants of Moslem
Indians who immigrated to Pakistan during the 1947 partition of the
subcontinent.
   The group is demanding recognition as Pakistan's fifth
nationality, along with the Punjabis, Pathans, Sindhis and Baluch.
   Thousands of troops swept across Sindh last week and arrested
more than 800 people, including members of the MQM and Ms. Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party.
   The MQM once backed Ms. Bhutto's government but withdrew its
support in November, forcing a no-confidence vote the prime
minister narrowly survived.
   Many residents believe the problem in Sindh is beyond the
government's control. Authorities have never made arrests in a
massacre on Sept. 30, 1988 that left at least 300 dead in Hyderabad.
   Ms. Bhutto acknowledged that the provincial government has not
done enough to curb the escalating violence and lawlessness. But
she accused neighboring India of stirring up trouble in Sindh and
the eastern province of Punjab.
   New Delhi denies those allegations and blames Pakistan for
violent separatist movements in Indian Punjab and Jammu-Kashmir,
India's only Moslem majority state. Pakistan denies the charges.

<HEAD>Detectives Again Investigating Serial Slayings in Northwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN K. WILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In scenes grimly reminiscent of the
nation's largest unsolved serial murder case, police are
investigating the deaths of three prostitutes dumped near the
Spokane River.
   Similarities exist between this case and the unsolved Green
River slayings that stopped six years ago in the Seattle area, but
investigators doubt they're linked.
   Still, police in Spokane are handling the latest case as the
work of a serial killer.
   It comes as no surprise to seasoned investigators that another
serial killer may be active in the Pacific Northwest.
   ``The Northwest is a particularly attractive area for a serial
killer to traverse,'' said Capt. T. Michael Nault, head of a unit
that includes the Green River Task Force based in Seattle, 300
miles west of Spokane. ``That is primarily because of the region's
perceived remoteness, its lesser per capita law enforcement and
even its reputation for a more laid-back law enforcement.''
   A detective from the Green River unit will meet soon with
Spokane investigators to point out potential pitfalls, said Lt. Jim
Hill, head of major crimes investigations for Spokane police.
   Nault, Hill and others see no apparent links between the
slayings of the three women in Spokane and the Green River case.
But as Nault put it: ``It's reckless to say there is no
possibility.''
   Police are investigating eight sets of serial killings on the
West Coast, Nault said.
   The Green River serial killer is blamed in the deaths and
disappearances of as many as 49 women in the Pacific Northwest
between mid-1982 and early 1984, many of them prostitutes.
   The first Spokane River victim turned up in February and the
most recent earlier this month. All three women, who had police
records for soliciting, were shot several times with a small
caliber weapon before their naked or semi-nude bodies were dumped,
police said.
   ``We were a little better off than the Green River investigation
because we had (the slayings) associated with a serial crime right
away,'' Hill said. ``We have a computer program that has been in
place since the second incident. It's a matter of making sure we
don't repeat someone else's errors.''
   Police in King County, where many of the Green River victims
were found, were criticized for not recognizing soon enough that a
serial killer was loose.
   Spokane investigators began looking into a possible serial crime
after the second body, that of Nickie Lowe, 34, was found March 25.
   By the time the body of the third victim, Kathleen A. Brisbois,
38, was found May 15, police had met with the Spokane County
Sheriff's Department, which contributed a detective to the
investigation. The body of the first woman, 26-year-old Yolanda
Sapp, was found on a riverbank Feb. 22.
   Except for the first five bodies found in or near the Green
River in August 1982, police found only skeletal remains, making
clues harder to find in that case.
   The Spokane River remains were found within days or hours of
death, which could yield better clues.
   ``The rule of thumb is, the sooner you get it, the more likely
you are to resolve it,'' said Hill. ``That's true whether it's a
homicide or a robbery or burglary.''

<HEAD>Veterans of Dunkirk Honor Slain Comrades</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUNKIRK, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With prayers, hymns and tears, thousands
of veterans of the Dunkirk evacuation assembled on a once-bloody
beachfront Sunday to honor comrades killed 50 years ago in one of
World War II's most crucial operations.
   The veterans, most British and many supporting themselves with
canes or umbrellas, watched as a Royal Navy Helicopter dropped a
wreath of poppies over a circle of dozens of the ships that helped
rescue trapped Allied troops in 1940.
   The former soldiers were deployed in ranks under their
regimental standards, and a chorus of ``God Save the Queen'' echoed
over the waves.
   At least 15,000 people, including relatives and onlookers, were
present.
   The veterans marched or rode to the beach after a ceremony in
the city center, rebuilt from near destruction in the Nazi
bombardment that chased the Allied soldiers to the seaside as
France fell to Germany.
   ``Some of us have been here before,'' Lord Donald Kaberry,
president of the Dunkirk Veterans Association, told the assembled
French, Belgian, Dutch, Australian and British veterans.
   ``We were here 50 years ago, when we crossed the beaches and
went back to the United Kingdom to regroup, fight again and win,''
said Kaberry, 82.
   He was an acting major in the British Expeditionary Force when
he was evacuated with 338,000 other Allied troops in what became
known as ``the Miracle of Dunkirk.''
   About 6,000 British veterans and their relatives descended on
the port city in far northern France for weekend celebrations
commemorating Operation Dynamo.
   It began when a ragtag fleet of 800 naval vessels, barges,
fishing boats and pleasure craft rallied to Winston Churchill's
call to save the Allied armies from the encircling Wehrmacht.
   On Thursday, seventy-three ships, many involved in the
operation, braved choppy Channel waters to cross from Dover to
Dunkirk and join the commemorations. Most were able to muster in a
circle offshore Sunday.
   Dignitaries on hand included Dunkirk Mayor Michel Delabarre, who
is France's transport minister, and British Transport Secretary
Cecil Parkinson.
   For the veterans, the return to Dunkirk was a time to reflect on
the war, their comrades who died and their own luck in having
survived.
   William Bannister, then a 20-year-old sapper in the King's Own
Royal Regiment, had gone without food for two days when he finally
made it aboard the British destroyer HMS Esk and curled up under a
gun turret to sleep.
   Moments later, the ship was attacked by German dive bombers.
   ``Fortunately they were all near misses. I just went to sleep,
even though that gun was going off all the while. It didn't wake me
up. I didn't move until I got back to Dover.''
   Many of the survivors, such as 71-year-old former Sgt. James
Wright, went on to fight in North Africa, Italy and Normandy.
   Wright recalled Dunkirk in May 1940 as a crushed city _ pounded
to rubble by German bombers and artillery, littered with burning
vehicles, bodies of thousands of civilians and soldiers dotting the
beaches and streets.
   ``The first time I was here, it was in ruins, all burning,'' he
said, gazing at the modern brick buildings, decked with French and
British flags, that now form the city center.
   English fisherman George Osborne, 76, said he makes an annual
trip to Dunkirk.
   Injured in a shipboard accident, he stayed behind when his two
brothers and three cousins crossed the Channel in their fishing
boat toward the besieged beaches. A German mine blew them to pieces.
   ``It doesn't seem like 50 years ago,'' he said, choking back
tears. ``It seems like yesterday. When I come back here, I feel
like I'm with them again.''

<TEXT>
   A woman police call a ``super mom''
staked out her 10-year-old daughter's bus stop with a camera after
the girl complained of being repeatedly approached by a stranger.
Officers credit the mother with helping catch an ex-convict who has
been charged with assault with intent to commit kidnapping.
   David Bruce Siebers, released last year after serving nine years
of a 10-to 21-year term on several charges, including rape, was
arrested Thursday and arraigned Friday.
   The Kent County Sheriff's Department would not release the
woman's name Sunday. She talked with the Grand Rapids Press on
Friday on condition of anonymity.
   The woman told police her daughter was approached three times by
a man at her bus stop. Officers watched the bus stop for a few days
before giving up. After that, the woman took over, arming herself
with binoculars and a camera with a zoom lens and managing to get a
picture when a suspect reappeared Thursday.
   ``What a super mom. I can't praise her enough,'' said police
Sgt. Kenneth Kleinheksel. ``Without her, this guy could have done a
lot of harm.''
   The woman said she happened to be watching her daughter May 16
when a man in a car drove up to her.
   ``I went right out there to ask who that person was and she
said, `He told me to get in the car. He'd drive me to school. He
showed me money, Mom. A bunch of it,''' she told the newspaper.
``When she said this was the third time he's done this, I was
flabbergasted.''
   ``She said, `He's stupid to think I'd fall for something like
that.' I don't think it occurred to her how dangerous it was until
she saw my reaction,'' the woman said.
   Police put unmarked surveillance cars at the bus stop for a few
days, but when that ended, the mother armed herself with binoculars
and a camera with a zoom lens. She said she spotted the car near
her daughter on Thursday.
   ``I watched him pull up and was ready to tear off after him. She
(the girl) turned and looked at him and ran for the house. It
seemed like it took forever for her to run for safety, but it was
probably really less than a second,'' said the mother. ``He took
off, and I took off after him at about 70, 75 miles an hour.''
   The mother recorded the man's license plate and snapped a blurry
picture of the car as she followed him. That led to Siebers' arrest.
   If convicted, Siebers could face up to 20 years in prison. Bond
was set at $25,000 but Siebers was ordered held because of possible
violation of his parole.
   In 1980, a plea bargain agreement allowed Siebers to plead
guilty but mentally ill to the August 1979 gunpoint rape of a store
clerk. He also pleaded guilty to armed robbery and possession of a
firearm during the commission of a felony, stemming from a November
1979 restaurant robbery. Two other rape charges and three other
armed robbery charges were dropped as part of the deal.
   In 1984, a judge reduced his sentence because of his status as a
model prisoner.

   Millions of people ignored terrorist
threats and voted Sunday in a presidential election that will
determine the course of the nation's war against the powerful drug
cartels and their hired killers.
   Under the watchful eye of army sharpshooters, women with babies
in their arms joined other Colombians in choosing among 12
candidates who survived a campaign in which three of their rivals
were shot and killed.
   Guerrilla groups also have been blamed for campaign attacks, and
there was scattered rebel violence in remote villages Saturday
night and before dawn Sunday. Four policemen were reported wounded
and seven were missing in the attacks, according to radio reports.
   The main issue that divided the four top candidates was whether
to continue the government's harsh crackdown on drug traffickers
and its policy of extraditing top dealers to the United States for
prosecution.
   Cesar Gaviria, 43, the candidate of the governing Liberal Party,
who has pledged to continue the crackdown, led all independent
polls and was expected to easily win the election.
   The candidate with the most votes wins, even if he fails to
garner more than 50 percent of the ballots.
   Colombians also voted on whether to call a national assembly to
make changes in Colombia's 104-year-old constitution. The new
president would decide which political parties and other groups
should appoint the assembly, which would act independently of the
nation's standing, elected Congress.
   The radio network Caracol said Sunday afternoon that based on a
poll, it was projecting approval of the constitutional assembly by
more than 90 percent of the voters.
   Proponents of constitutional reform say changes are needed to
break the upper class's grip on this country. Proposed changes
would strengthen the judicial system, emphasize land reform and
increase checks and balances in the government. Colombia's
president now has wide powers that easily allow him to sidestep
Congress and the Supreme Court.
   The polls opened at 8 a.m. and preliminary results were expected
an hour or so after polls closed at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT). More than
13 million people were eligible to vote, but turnout figures were
not immediately available.
   The vote was suspended in four villages because of guerrilla
incursions, government and army officials were quoted as telling
the national radio networks RCN and Caracol. The rebels also
ambushed police patrols near three more villages, the reports said.
   As the polls opened in the capital, Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana
declared one minute of silence for the three assassinated
presidential candidates.
   A police bugler played taps during the ceremony at the huge
Bolivar Plaza, causing many in the crowd of hundreds to weep openly.
   Besides the three presidential candidates, 262 policemen, 93
soldiers, three judges, 15 news media employees and about 1,700
other people have been slain in the past nine months. Bombs have
exploded at schools, churches and stores. One bomb killed 107
people on a Colombian jetliner.
   In the two weeks leading up to Sunday's balloting, nine bombs
exploded in four Colombian cities, killing 37 people and wounding
more than 320.
   Few of the crimes have been solved, but suspicion for most of
the killings has fallen on drug traffickers, who have private
armies and billions of dollars in cocaine profits at their
disposal, and who hoped to disrupt the election.
   President Virgilio Barco, who is prohibited from seeking a
second consecutive four-year term, voted along with his wife in the
plaza.
   Several hours earlier, he went on national television to appeal
to voters to show courage and come out to vote.
   ``My countrymen, never before has it been so clear that the
future of Colombia is in your hands. All of us must vote,'' he
said. ``To vote is to support democracy, to reject violence and to
defend the rights that the terrorists want to snatch from us.''
   ``I do not have the slightest doubt that both the terrorist acts
aimed at taking the lives of presidential candidates as well as
those committed against other compatriots have been carried out to
intimidate the popular will.''
   An armed force of 232,000 men was put on alert several days
before the election. Troops were seen throughout the capital of 6
million people.
   Police and army sharpshooters were crouched on the roofs of
buildings near many voting booths early Sunday.
   The four main candidates were Gaviria, Rodrigo Lloreda, 48;
Alvaro Gomez, 71, and Antonio Navarro, 41.
   Gaviria became the Liberal Party candidate after Luis Carlos
Galan assassination by drug traffickers on Aug. 18. His killing
prompted the government to declare war on the drug cartels.
   Lloreda, a former foreign minister, has said he would end
extradition of trafficking suspects to the United States. Lloreda
represents the Conservative Party, the country's second-largest
party.
   Gomez broke from the Conservative Party to run as an
independent. He, too, has suggested that he would end extraditions.
He wants cocaine legalized in the United States and other
countries, saying this would deprive the traffickers of profits
they use to terrorize Colombia and undermine its democracy.
   Navarro was one of the leaders the April 19 Movement guerrilla
group, known as the M-19. The rebel group disbanded earlier this
year in exchange for pardons and the right to form a political
party.
   Navarro stepped in when the party's first presidential
candidate, Carlos Pizarro, was assassinated on April 26 in a
killing blamed on drug traffickers. Navarro favors continuing the
government's crackdown.
   The third presidential candidate assassinated was Bernardo
Jaramillo of the Patriotic Union Party. He was slain March 22. The
party, its ranks decimated by right-wing death squads, withdrew
from the election.
   The police said drug traffickers killed Jaramillo.

   Emil J. Konopinski, who helped design
the atomic bomb, died Saturday at Bloomington Hospital after a long
illness at age 78. The exact cause of death was not given.
   Konopinski, a physics professor emeritus at Indiana University,
initially worked on the construction of the first nuclear fission
reactor with Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago.
   He went to the Los Alamos National Laboratory during World War
II with J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller to set up the
research group that developed the first atomic bomb.
   Konopinski helped design the bomb before the needed uranium and
plutonium were available. He also did safety calculations for the
plants where the bombs would be manufactured.
   He proved theoretically that a thermonuclear explosion would not
ignite the atmosphere or the oceans and destroy the Earth. The
scientists could not perform test explosions without this
information.
   From 1946 to 1968 he served as a consultant to the Atomic Energy
Commission.
   He wrote the book, ``The Theory of Beta Radioactivity.''
   Survivors include a brother, Eugene W. Konrad, and a sister,
Marian Hansen.

   A clash between supporters of a
fledgling opposition party and security forces left six
demonstrators dead and an unspecified number of police injured in a
city northwest of here, state-run radio said Sunday.
   Cameroon is the latest of France's former African colonies where
an opposition movement has called on an authoritarian government to
make political reforms.
   The radio said demonstrators were trampled to death in
Saturday's clash, but witnesses said they were shot by police.
   The radio also claimed the demonstrators stoned and clubbed
unarmed police, burned police vehicles and set up barricades before
reinforcements arrived to subdue the protesters.
   The clash came after supporters of the newly formed Democratic
Social Front assembled in Bamenda, in an English-speaking area 36
miles east of the Nigerian frontier. Authorities had warned the
group not to try to hold political meetings.
   President Paul Biya, who has ruled since November 1982, has
refused to allow any opposition parties to organize.
   Although the country's constitution allows such parties, Biya's
Cameroon Democratic People's Movement is the only legal party.
   In April, a lawyer and 10 other people were convicted of
subversion after trying to organize an opposition party.
   Soldiers prevented the public from watching the rial, and one of
the defense lawyers was shot dead at a roadblock on the day the
convictions were handed down.
   The Cameroon Bar Association has called on the government to
tolerate opposition, but has been warned that it should remain out
of politics.
   The Democratic Social Front was first formed three months ago by
a Bamenda publisher, John Frundi. He filed papers to create his
party with government authorities and was told it would take two
months to examine them.
   Two weeks ago, having received no reply, he said he was going
ahead with organization of the party.
   Cameroon gained independence from France in 1960 but the former
British Cameroons did not become part of the country until 1961.
Part of it was incorporated into Nigeria and a strip along the
eastern Nigerian border was made part of Cameroon.

   African National Congress guerrilla
commanders and veteran officers of the white-led South African army
ended an unprecedented conference Sunday pledging to work for peace.
   In a joint statement released in the Zambian capital after five
days of talks, the two sides declared there should be a ``mutually
binding cessation of hostilities'' as soon as possible.
   The conference, convened to discuss the present and future role
of the security forces, went ahead without the blessing of South
African Defense Minister Magnus Malan.
   But the 48 current and former military officers who attended
said they would make recommendations privately to the government on
their return home.
   The participants said they envisioned a cease-fire agreement
under which the ANC military wing would halt guerrilla attacks and
sabotage, while the South African army would remove troops from
black townships and halt search-and-kill operations.
   Before departing for home late Sunday, the officers said they
had developed friendships with the guerrillas. One Cuban-trained
ANC fighter said he was impressed with the frankness of the talks
and the warm atmosphere.
   ``We've always told ourselves that if we ever came across an
SADF man anywhere it would be a question of who was faster,'' said
the man, who identified himself only as Duncan. He referred to the
South African Defense Force.
   Lusaka was chosen as the location for the conference because it
is close to South Africa and is home to the external headquarters
of the ANC, the largest movement fighting to end South Africa's
apartheid policies.
   The Lusaka meeting was the latest example of easing hostilities
between South Africa's white minority, which controls political and
economic power, and the 28 million voteless black majority.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid movements were legalized in
February. ANC leader Nelson Mandela was also freed from 27 years'
imprisonment for anti-government activities.
   Earlier this month both Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk,
architect of the reforms, began talks on the political future of
South Africa. Military crackdowns on activists in black townships
postponed the first planned meeting.
   In Lusaka, the two sides agreed that once progress has been made
in political discussions, ANC guerrillas should be permitted to
return to South Africa and integrated into the existing army or
demobilized.
   A new restructured army of conventional troops and former
guerrillas should be non-partisan, accountable to Parliament and
recruited and promoted on the basis of merit alone, their joint
statement said.
   ``We began a process over the last few days of moving forward
together,'' ANC foreign affairs chief Thabo Mbeki said. ``We have
an obligation to our people to sustain that process.''

<HEAD>Shiite Leader Links Freeing British Hostages to Rushdie</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem leader said Sunday at
least one of four British hostages in Lebanon could be released if
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher deports writer Salman
Rushdie for allegedly defaming Islam.
   Hussein Musawi also said the May 19 massacre of seven
Palestinian laborers by an Israeli gunman will hurt efforts to free
the six American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I believe and hope that some of the British hostages could be
freed if Margaret Thatcher deported Salman Rushdie from England,''
Musawi said.
   Rushdie, an Indian-born naturalized Briton, was sentenced to
death by Iran's revolutionary leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, in February 1989 for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his
novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``She doesn't have to hand him over to us or send him to Iran or
Syria,'' he said. ``It would be enough if she gave us proof that he
has left the country.
   ``She can send him anywhere she wants,'' Musawi said from his
headquarters in the Bekaa Valley town of Baalbek in east Lebanon.
   The Britons and Americans are among 16 Westerners missing in
Lebanon. Most are held by pro-Iranian Shiite factions. Longest-held
is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the
Associated Press. He was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Iran severed relations with Britain in February 1989 after
Britain accused the Iranians of terrorism and protested Khomeini's
death threat. Rushdie has been in hiding under guard ever since.
   Iran and Syria helped obtain the release last month of American
hostages Robert Polhill and Frank Reed as ``goodwill gestures.''
   But the Iranians have said no more Americans will be freed until
Washington makes a reciprocal gesture. President Bush has refused,
citing his policy of not negotiating with terrorists and those who
support them.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Sunday reiterated Iran's
accusation that the West had made no move to obtain the release of
``Iranian, Lebanese and Palestinian hostages'' to reciprocate for
the release of American hostages.
   Rafsanjani referred to Palestinians and Lebanese Shiite Moslems
held by Israel and their Christian allies in southern Lebanon, and
four Iranians kidnapped and missing in the Christian enclave in
Lebanon in 1982.
   ``I believe that the British, unlike the Americans, are now
behaving in a positive manner that may encourage the
hostage-holders to free a British hostage as a goodwill gesture,''
Musawi said.
   Musawi heads Islamic Amal, a pro-Syrian faction within the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, believed the parent
movement for the extremists holding Westerners.
   He is also reputed mentor of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine, a Shiite faction that holds American educators Jesse
Turner and Alann Steen.
   Musawi was believed to have been instrumental in securing the
release of Polhill April 22. But he urged kidnappers not to free
Reed after the U.S. Congress endorsed a united Jerusalem as
Israel's capital two days later.
   Musawi made his remarks as radical Iranian newspapers in Tehran
said that any British effort to restore relations with Tehran were
pointless so long as Mrs. Thatcher's government defends Rushdie.
   ``London's efforts are doomed if they are directed to secure
Salman Rushdie's life,'' the Jomhuri Islami daily said in an
editorial.
   The British captives are Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, who
disappeared Jan. 20, 1987; journalist John McCarthy, kidnapped
April 17, 1986; ex-Royal Air Force pilot Jack Mann, kidnapped May
12, 1989, and writer Alec Collett, kidnapped March 25, 1985.
   Musawi's remarks came a day after the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad
for the Liberation of Palestine said it would make the United
States and Israel ``pay the price'' for the killing the unarmed
Palestinians by a former Israeli soldier.
   ``This massacre will have a negative effect on the issue of the
American hostages,'' Musawi said.
   ``Israelis cannot do anything without American backing. This is
how things are linked in the minds and thoughts of our people,'' he
said.

   A fire possibly started by a cigarette killed all
five members of a young family and a visitor at their home Sunday
in the deadliest blaze in Boston in 18 years, officials said.
   Firefighters were on the scene about three minutes after the
fire was reported in the wooden duplex, but flames spread too fast
for the occupants to be saved, said Fire Commissioner Leo Stapleton.
   ``These were old wooden buildings, about 100 years old, so the
fire spread very quickly,'' he said. ``It raced right up the stairs
into the bedrooms.''
   Stapleton said he suspected a cigarette left in an overstuffed
chair might have sparked the blaze.
   ``We know one of the male occupants had been smoking earlier in
the evening,'' Stapleton said. ``We think right now the cause was
careless smoking.''
   The fire leaped to an adjoining building and crossed an alley to
a third building, but no other injuries were reported, Stapleton
said.
   It was the worst blaze in the city since 1972, when nine
firefighters died battling a fire at the Hotel Vendome, Stapleton
said.
   Fire officials did not immediately identify the victims but said
they were a couple, both in their 20s, and their three young
daughters. A man believed to be a friend of the family also died,
officials said.
   A woman believed to be the young mother's sister escaped by
climbing out a window and into an adjoining building.

   Veterans and supporters took the first steps of
hundred-mile walks Sunday in three states as they sought to remind
the nation during the Memorial Day weekend that many soldiers have
never come home.
   ``We're sure that we still have some prisoners in Southeast
Asia. We're going to work at this thing till the day when some of
them walk out of there,'' said World War II veteran Charles Walker.
   Four groups _ from Chicago, Peoria, Madison, Wis.; and Baldwin,
Iowa _ are staging the event dubbed the ``Walk of the Warriors,''
said Mary Buttry Holub of Warrenville, who helped organize it.
   The marchers plan to meet Thursday in the northern Illinois city
of Oregon and continue Friday to the nearby Lake LaDonna
campground, where they plan to spend the weekend camping together.
   Before they started, organizers were unsure how many people
would participate in the walk in honor of prisoners of war and
those declared missing in action.
   A total of 2,340 American servicemen remain unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia, said Tom Stack, a member of the Illinois Vietnam
Veterans Leadership Program.
   Holub had just graduated from Lisle High School west of Chicago
in 1965 when the Vietnam War began to affect her directly and
ultimately change her life. In 1966, one of her best friends was
killed.
   ``We didn't believe it would happen. We'd just graduated, and
life was fun. Vietnam was so far away. It wasn't part of our
lives,'' she said.
   Her brother joined the Marines in 1969, the same year her cousin
was killed in the war.
   Her brother came home, but suffered from addiction to drugs,
alcoholism and what veterans call ``survivor guilt,'' Holub said.
   But since then, she said, her brother has turned around his
life, is raising a family and devotes himself to the
prisoner-of-war issue _ a commitment she's also made.
   ``I have two boys,'' she said. ``I don't want to give up my
children to a foreign country and not get them back. I have no
problem letting them serve because I love my country. But we've
been lied to.''
   She noted that a pending House measure would amend the 1942
Missing Personnel Act to require the government to provide proof
before declaring a soldier dead. Now the law allows a declaration
of death after one year without proof, she said.
   Stack said the marchers' goal ``is to heighten that awareness so
people will get involved to request of their officials, congressmen
and senators that they continue to work hard to explore this issue
to the `nth' degree.''
   Stack, who wears a bracelet commemorating an Air Force colonel
shot down over Laos on April 25, 1971, added, ``I empathize for
those family members who don't know. There has to be an accounting.
If there are remains, the remains should be returned. If they're
alive, they should be returned.''

<HEAD>Thousands Roll Past White House in Support of Missing in Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts staged a
``rolling thunder'' rally Sunday past the White House and the
Soviet and Laotian embassies to protest the handling of America's
missing in action from the Vietnam War.
   ``The effort is to keep alive before the public and the media an
issue the White House is trying to lay to rest,'' said Ted Sampley
of Kinston, N.C., one of the organizers.
   National Park Police estimated that 15,000 people took part in
the rally and an associated ``Rock for Freedom'' concert and
demonstration held near the Lincoln and Vietnam Memorials.
   Thousands of cyclists gathered shortly before noon at the
Pentagon before motoring past the White House along a
police-approved route.
   Police rejected a request for a permit for the cyclists to motor
en masse past the Soviet and Laotian embassies, claiming it would
tie up traffic, according to the event's organizers.
   Nonetheless, groups of five to 20 cyclists at a time rumbled in
ad hoc ``thunder alley runs'' throughout the afternoon in front of
the embassies, where organizers handed out patches with skulls and
crossbones to riders as they passed.
   ``The authorities have done everything in their power to
interfere with this thing,'' said Sampley, who chairs a group
called the National Steering Committee for American War Veterans.
``The State Department did not want us over at the Laotian
Embassy.''
   He said the embassy was targeted because Laos ``never has
answered publicly'' what became of the U.S. prisoners they were
holding at the end of the war.
   About 2,300 Americans are now listed by the government as
missing in action in the Vietnam War, which also included fighting
in Cambodia and Laos. The war ended in 1975 with Communist
victories in all three countries.
   Of the missing, 537 were in Laos when last seen _ most of them
in areas then under control of North Vietnamese forces, according
to U.S. officials.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told
striking train workers that their walkout is propelling the country
toward civil war, but the strikers rebuffed his appeal for a
settlement and threatened new stoppages.
   The Solidarity labor union's leader also suggested that Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki might be forced to resign if the
protests spread.
   A week of sporadic strikes has crippled freight transport to
Poland's Baltic coast from the industrial south and Czechoslovakia
and Hungary. The army has been called in to move essential
shipments.
   Walesa held a three-hour meeting with the strikers, who broke
off talks with the government in Warsaw a day earlier. The
Solidarity labor leader, who himself rose to prominence by leading
the strike at the Gdansk shipyard, begged the workers to call off
the walkout.
   ``Please do it for Poland,'' he said. ``We don't want a civil
war now, and what's going on now is leading to it.''
   The new Solidarity government has refused to even discuss the
strikers' pay demands. It says they could scuttle the drastic
economic reforms now under way. Strikers said they will carry out a
new stoppage Monday. The Solidarity railroad union urged members
not to participate in the stoppage at midday Monday. The move is
being spearheaded by the OPZZ union, which was formerly backed by
the old Communist government.
   The strike committee is also calling for a work stoppage on
Tuesday evening.
   Officials said thousands of the nation's 400,000 railroad
workers were striking but could give no specific number. Transport
officials have noted that it only takes a few strikers to snarl
rail traffic.
   Walesa has charged that the strikers' legitimate grievances are
being manipulated by the OPZZ union, whose chairman is a former
Communist Party Politburo member.
   Solidarity Labor Minister Jacek Kuron says the wage demands are
inflationary.
   ``I am willing to talk with everybody ... about everything
except wages,'' he said.
   The strikers want to raise rail workers' pay to 110 percent of
the average national wage of about $79 monthly. They are also
seeking the dismissal of railroad directors installed by the former
Communist government, whom they say are incompetent and hampering
reforms.
   Walesa told the strikers the government cannot give in because
``there are others waiting in line for strikes.''
   ``The government's concession ... would be an indication that if
one goes on strike, one gets whatever one wants. The prime minister
will resign if protests spread,'' Walesa said.
   Mazowiecki has repeatedly voiced sympathy Poles suffering
hardship during the 5-month-old bid to create a market economy from
the shattered socialist system.
   But the prime minister said there would be no return to the huge
government subsidies for unprofitable and inefficient state-run
industries, including the railroads.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in a
hastily scheduled television address Sunday, appealed to countrymen
to stay calm about plans to double food prices under a shift to a
regulated market economy.
   ``Don't panic, comrades!'' Gorbachev said, hoping to stem a run
on stores prompted by the new economic reform package announced
Thursday by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   He acknowledged that ``an anxious mood has arisen in the
country'' over the economic plan.
   The Soviet president spoke for 45 minutes from a prepared text.
He is scheduled to leave Tuesday for a summit meeting in Washington
with President Bush.
   In addition to touching off panic buying, the reforms have also
drawn criticism from such radicals as Boris N. Yeltsin who advocate
a much swifter transition to a market economy.
   Yeltsin is running on a radical reform platform for president of
the Russian federation, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics. He
failed to gain a majority in the first two rounds of balloting in
the Russian Congress last week, but said he will compete in the
third round, scheduled for Monday.
   In his speech, Gorbachev said that under the new reforms, lower
income people would be compensated for the price increases and
those who lose their jobs would be retrained for new work.
   Some economists have estimated that up to 40 million people
could lose their jobs as a result of the reforms, expected to drive
many inefficient businesses into bankruptcy.
   But Gorbachev said, ``This transition to a market economy ...
cannot be postponed, because negative consequences will develop.
What we need now is social accord.''
   He did not mention a plan for holding a public referendum on the
radical five-year reform. That was discussed by Ryzhkov's deputies
Yuri Maslyukov and Leonid Abalkin on Wednesday.
   Under Ryzhkov's reforms, bread prices would triple to about
$1.09 a loaf on July 1, and other food prices would double on
average on Jan 1.
   The average Soviet monthy salary is $279. Ryzhkov said Thursday
that bread makes up 20 percent of the average Soviet diet.
   Under the three-phase reform plan, which carries through 1995,
60 percent of state enterprises would be sold to the public sector,
and controls would be lifted on 60 percent of prices.
   Other prices would remain under state control, and many
industries would stay in state hands, over the opposition of
radical reformers.
   Gorbachev said the current price of bread ``does not at all
correspond to the amount of labor in its production. ... People buy
bread and feed it to their animals. And this at a time when we are
forced to buy grain abroad.''
   He said that in the United States and Canada, which sell grain
to Moscow, the price of bread is four times as high as in the
Soviet Union, where food prices are heavily subsidized.
   Panic buying continued on Sunday in Soviet stores. Shoppers
jammed Gastronom No. 1 on Gorky Street, where clerks said sales
were several times the normal rate.
   Gorbachev, without mentioning names, spoke against critics of
the government reform program: ``They can inflict irreparable
damage. We must put those hecklers in their places. They are guided
only by their ambitions and not the interests of the people.''
   But criticism has come not only from populists like Yeltsin, but
from the mainstream press.
   A commentary written by economist Yegor Gaidar in Sunday's
edition of the Communist Party daily, Pravda, said: ``with each
passing day, it becomes clearer that to try to balance between the
market and administrative measures is impossible, that traditional
commands are not working, and that the center is losing control.''
He called for a swifter transition to a market economy.
   The government newspaper Izvestia ran a commentary, written by
Eduard Gonzalez, calling for a nationwide referendum on the reform
plan.

   Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands won the
fastest Indianapolis 500 ever Sunday, his first Indy-car victory on
any track.
   Luyendyk, 36, who had never before even led a lap at Indy,
passed former winner Bobby Rahal for the lead on lap 168 and pulled
away, running laps at over 220 mph whenever he had a clear track.
   His average speed of 185.984 mph broke Rahal's record of 170.722
in 1986, and produced the fastest 500-mile Indy-car race ever,
breaking the mark of 180.654 set by Danny Sullivan at Michigan in
1988.
   Luyendyk completed the 200 laps in just 2 hours, 41 minutes,
18.248 seconds.
   Defending champion Emerson Fittipaldi of Brazil, who dominated
the first half of the race, finished third, 41.7 seconds behind the
winner, after being slowed by two blistered tires. Al Unser Jr. was
fourth, followed by three-time winner Rick Mears and four-time
winner A.J. Foyt.
   Luyendyk, the 1985 rookie of the year when he finished seventh
for his only previous top 10 Indy finish, was second in a road race
at Portland, Ore., in 1988 in his best previous Indy-car effort.
   ``I can't believe this is happening,'' he said in Victory Lane.
   ``The car was just working beautifully,'' said Luyendyk. ``With
35, 30 laps to go, I turned it up and there was just nobody who
could keep up with us. For me it wasn't a very hard race at all.
   ``I said if I had to win my first race, I'd want it to be
Indianapolis, but I'm going to have to let this one sink in.''
   The winner is expected to earn a payoff of more than $1 million
when the total purse, likely more than $6 million, is announced at
the victory banquet Monday night. The race drew a crowd of more
than 400,000.
   Sullivan, the 1985 winner, hit the wall on lap 20 between turns
one and two after something broke in his rear suspension. He
complained of dizziness and was taken to a hospital for
examination, but was released before the end of the race.

<HEAD>Israeli Sentenced To Three Years For Desecrating Jewish Graves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A court Sunday sentenced a messianic Jew to
three years in prison after he confessed to desecrating more than
300 Jewish graves in hopes Arabs would be blamed.
   The spray-painting of the Jewish gravestones with anti-Israeli
slogans received widespread publicity, coming just after the
discovery of the desecration of a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras,
France, on May 10.
   In the Carpentras incident, a recently buried body was dug up
and impaled on the pole of an umbrella. It provoked outrage in
France.
   The sentenced Israeli, 41-year-old David Goldner, said he
regretted his action. He declared that at the time, he had hoped it
would unite Jews against Arabs.
   Also charged in the incident in this coastal city was Gershon
Tannenbaum, 32, who also confessed. His sentencing has been put off
pending a psychiatric examination.
   Both men belong to a group that practices a mystical form of
Judaism and hopes to hasten the arrival of the Messiah.
   Judge Amirav Rand of Haifa Magistrates Court imposed the maximum
sentence and told Goldner if he had wanted to wake up the Israeli
people to perceived dangers from Arabs, 30 graves would have been
enough.
   Goldner refused to discuss his sentence when he left court, but
told reporters: ``A war is expected soon, and the Prophet Elijah
will come.''
   According to the Scriptures, the prophet will signal the arrival
of the Messiah.
   Goldner was to be transferred Monday from jail to a permanent
prison facility.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain spread over much of the central part of the nation Sunday,
heavy rain drenched parts of parched Florida, and there was a
threat of snow in the mountains of northern California.
   Near-continuous rain from a low-pressure area in the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico mixed with remnants of this year's
first tropical depression Sunday to drench much of southern Florida.
   The heaviest rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT was
2.88 inches at Miami; 2.14 inches at West Palm Beach, Fla.; and
2.09 inches at Columbus, Miss.
   Standing water on freeways contributed to accidents, police
said. And rain delayed a regional college baseball tournament at
the University of Miami in Coral Gables. At game time Sunday
afternoon, groundskeepers were playing on a raft in the flooded
outfield.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from central and
southeastern Oklahoma to south-central through northwestern Kansas,
northeastern Texas, western Arkansas, northeastern Louisiana,
eastern Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, western Tennessee,
Mississippi, northern Alabama, northern Georgia and western South
Carolina.
   Wind gusted to 54 mph during thunderstorms in Chattanooga, Tenn.
   Showers were scattered over southwestern Wisconsin, southeastern
Minnesota, northeastern Iowa, eastern and southwestern Nebraska and
western North Dakota.
   In the East, scattered showers fell over northern and central
New England.
   A cold storm system moved across the Pacific Coast and showers
extended from the northern half of California to northwestern
Nevada, western and central Oregon, and from south-central through
western Washington. During the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.75
inches of rain fell at Crescent City, Calif., on the coast near the
Oregon state line.
   Locally heavy rain was possible in the valleys and lower
elevations of northern California and advisories for snow were
posted into early Monday over higher elevations of the Mount
Shasta-Siskiyou area and for the Sierra Nevada north of Yosemite
National Park. Snow also was expected across higher elevations of
northern and central Nevada.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Tahoe Valley, Calif., to 99 at Sanderson, Texas.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 28 degrees at West
Yellowstone, Mont.

   Soil saturated with flammable and toxic
chemicals caught fire around an abandoned chemical plant, prompting
firefighters to evacuate residents of a sparsely populated desert
area.
   No injuries were reported during the emergency that began
Saturday night and ended early Sunday, said Kern County Fire Capt.
Kenneth Frasca.
   Firefighters said the blaze started with a grass fire that swept
toward the abandoned chemical plant, which contained barrels of
cyanide, flammable chemicals, mercury and oxidizers.
   ``We didn't have the barrels on fire, but the chemicals in the
dirt were burning, if you can picture that,'' said Frasca.
   He said there were several chemicals in the soil around the
plant, which has been under a cleanup order by several agencies,
including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for the past
year.
   Frasca said the chemicals in the soil were the same as the
materials stored in barrels, but mixed together from leaks and
spills over the years.
   Authorities estimated that residents of about 75 to 100
scattered houses, mobile homes, apartments and a motel in the area
65 miles north of Los Angeles were evacuated.
   About 30 firefighters from the Kern County Fire Department were
sent to the blaze, said dispatcher Denise Avalos. An engine company
from nearby Edwards Air Force Base also was sent to help, Avalos
said.

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk on
Sunday launched a harsh attack on pro-apartheid whites, saying the
country's leading right-wing movement had become ``irresponsible,
undemocratic and dangerous.''
   De Klerk's denunciation of the Conservative Party came after
50,000 right-wing whites rallied Saturday and vowed to resist de
Klerk's plans to dismantle the nation's system of racial
segregation.
   The rally in the capital of Pretoria was the largest
pro-apartheid demonstration since de Klerk came to power in August
and began a series of reforms.
   At the rally Saturday, the leader of the Conservatives, Andries
Treurnicht, told his supporters that whites would fight moves to
bring about a black government.
   ``The so-called New South Africa of forced integration, which
the government is forcing on us, gives us no other choice but to
defend our rights,'' Treurnicht said.
   De Klerk rejected that stance Sunday.
   ``The Conservative Party's threats of revolt and resistance are
irresponsible, undemocratic and dangerous to our country,'' de
Klerk was quoted as saying in Monday's editions of The Nationalist,
the official publication of his ruling National Party.
   The comments, among the strongest he has leveled against the
right wing to date, were made available on Sunday night.
   De Klerk said ``radicalism'' by the Conservatives could lead to
``broedertwis,'' or a fight between brothers.
   The Conservatives won 31 percent of the vote in white elections
last year and are the official opposition in the dominant white
chamber of Parliament. The party favors rigid apartheid and says
blacks should have political rights only in tribal homelands.
   De Klerk has said he wants to end discrimination and negotiate a
new constitution that will allow the 5 million whites to share
power with the 28 million blacks.
   Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, the
country's largest black opposition group, on Saturday accused de
Klerk of not moving fast enough to end apartheid.
   Mandela, speaking at a rally near Pretoria, also said his
organization felt de Klerk ``is not strong enough to end the
violence going on.''
   Mandela was referring to both black factional fighting in Natal
province and the actions of the police, who have fired on black
demonstrators several times in recent weeks, resulting in more than
20 deaths.
   Police said Sunday morning that nine blacks had been killed in
the preceding 24 hours in a series of new faction fights in Natal.
About 4,000 blacks have died in the region since 1986.
   In another development Sunday, African National Congress
guerrilla commanders and veteran officers of the white-led South
African army ended an unprecedented conference pledging to work for
peace.
   In a joint statement released in the Zambian capital of Lusaka
after five days of talks, the two sides declared there should be a
``mutually binding cessation of hostilities'' as soon as possible.
   The conference, convened to discuss the present and future role
of the security forces, did not have the approval of South African
Defense Minister Magnus Malan.
   But the 48 current and former military officers who attended
said they would make recommendations privately to the government on
their return home.

   Some icons of American history are
not what they claim, author Kurt Vonnegut Jr. told University of
Rhode Island graduates Sunday.
   Vonnegut told about 2,700 graduates that while Boston and
Philadelphia both claim to be the ``birthplace of liberty,''
freedom was ``only conceived there, so Boston and Philadelphia were
only motels of liberty.''
   ``The gestation period of American liberty has taken 200 years
or more,'' said Vonnegut, whose satiric novels take darkly humorous
looks at the past, present and future.
   ``Don't be cynical about the American experiment because it has
only now begun,'' said Vonnegut, author of ``Breakfast of
Champions,'' ``Cat's Cradle,'' ``Slaughterhouse Five'' and 11 other
novels.
   Vonnegut, whose new novel, ``Hocus Pocus, or What's the Hurry,
Son,'' is due out in September, left the crowd with two ``highly
personal opinions.''
   ``One, the noblest of all professions are nursing and teaching
... and two, no matter where you are, even in the U.S. Army, there
will be at least one saint. And it might even be you,'' he said.

<HEAD>Source Denies Claim of Nuclear Test in Nevada</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A source close to the nation's weapons testing
program on Sunday denied claims by anti-nuclear activists that the
United States recently conducted a nuclear test.
   ``It would really be foolhardy to conduct a nuclear test this
close to the Bush-Gorbachev summit,'' the source said of the
upcoming meeting in Washington between the U.S. and Soviet leaders.
   The source, who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of
anonymity, flatly denied that the United States conducted any
recent test.
   Activists attending a worldwide gathering against nuclear
testing reported that the United States detonated a nuclear weapon
underground Friday at the Nevada Test Site, 65 miles northwest of
Las Vegas.
   The comments came at a conference in Alma Ata, U.S.S.R., a city
in the Soviet Union near the Russian nuclear test site of
Semipalatinsk.
   Anti-nuclear activists from around the world, including the
United States and Soviet Union, are attending the four-day
conference.
   Dr. Bernard Lown, an organizer of the conference and president
of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, said
he was ``ashamed and angered'' at the reports of a nuclear test in
the United States.
   ``This makes no sense,'' Lown said. ``Why are we conducting
nuclear tests just a few days before the summit?''
   The American source agreed, and said it was a mystery as to
where the anti-nuclear activists heard of a test.
   All U.S. and British tests are conducted at the Nevada site.
Larger tests are announced in advance and smaller tests are
revealed after the fact.
   In past years, some tests have not been announced for security
reasons.
   It is believed in recent years that all tests have been
announced, although the government continues to maintain an
official policy that some tests may not be announced.
   The United States conducts about a dozen tests a year at the
desert site.

   Arab leaders who want to stop the
emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel gathered Sunday to forge a
united front on the issue, but divisions and rivalries were at work
even before the emergency summit began.
   The 21-member Arab league was also expected to criticize the
United States for its support of Israel.
   In a move certain to draw anger at the Arab gathering, Israel
said Sunday it expected the number of Soviet immigrants to increase
to 20,000 per month this summer. About 40,000 Soviet Jews have
arrived so far this year.
   The Arabs see the new wave of Jewish emigration, coupled with
Israel's rejection of recent peace proposals, as a threat. They
fear many Soviet Jews will settle in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, which the Palestinians proclaimed their homeland in
1988.
   Israeli officials deny there are plans to settle the Soviet Jews
in the occupied areas and force out the Palestinian inhabitants.
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide, Avi Pazner,
quoted Shamir as saying he hoped the summit meeting will ``not pour
fuel on to the fire, but to the contrary will also contribute to
improving the atmosphere, maybe by agreeing to negotiations with
Israel.''
   Shamir has repeatedly called for Arab nations to enter into
direct talks with Israel.
   The Baghdad summit will underscore old disputes that have
blocked efforts to forge Arab unity.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
arch-rival in the Arab world, refused to attend. So did four other
heads of state, although some will send high-level officials in
their place.
   Assad, miffed that the summit is being held in his rival's
capital, rebuffed intensive Arab efforts _ including a last-minute
effort by Libya's Moammar Gadhafi _ to persuade him to end his
11-year-old feud with Saddam in the interest of Arab unity.
   ``The summit will get under way with us unable to project even a
semblance of unity,'' said an Arab diplomat from the Persian Gulf
region, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Fifteen presidents, kings and sheiks of the Arab world, which
stretches from the Persian Gulf to the Atlantic, jetted into
Baghdad airport Sunday to a red-carpet welcome from Saddam.
   Among them were King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, King Hussein of
Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. Fahd's presence
particularly was seen as a major boost for the summit.
   Amid tight security, the international airport was closed to
regular traffic as the leaders arrived. Saddam greeted each as a
military band played national anthems and the military fired 21-gun
salutes.
   The rift between Syria and Iraq was not likely to be a key issue
at the summit.
   But one of the main differences will be between those who favor
getting tough with the United States, Israel's main backer, and
those who seek a more moderate line.
   Iraq and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is an Arab
League member, want to take a tough line.
   The moderates are led by Egypt and oil-rich Saudi Arabia.
   A 16-page memorandum from Washington, delivered to Arab foreign
ministers who met in Baghdad last week to pave the way for the
summit, touched off an uproar by urging the Arabs to avoid
rhetoric, focus on direct Arab-Israeli negotiations and avoid
outright denunications of Soviet Jewish emigration.
   The memorandum also accused Iraq, which boasts it has developed
binary chemical weapons and long-range missiles capable of hitting
Israeli cities, of violating international conventions banning use
of chemical and biological weapons.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz angrily dismissed the American
document as ``inaccurate and insensitive.''
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat, an ally of Saddam, called last month
for the summit to discuss ways to blunt Soviet Jewish emigration to
Israel and revive the stalled peace process.
   The summit follows a new wave of violence in the
Israeli-occupied territories touched off by the May 20 slaying of
seven unarmed Palestinian laborers near Tel Aviv by a former
Israeli soldier. Israeli authorities said the gunman was deranged.
   Saddam and the PLO insisted the summit convene ahead of the May
31 meeting between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, with the apparent intention of focussing the
superpowers' attention on their problems.
   Lebanese President Elias Hrawi has said that, like Assad, he
will not attend the summit. Two-thirds of his war-ravaged country
is under Syrian military control.
   Conference sources said President Chadli Bendjedid of Algeria
will not attend in sympathy with Syria, and King Hassan of Morocco
also will not participate; conference sources said he hates flying.
   But those leaders will send high-level delegations.
   Sultan Qaboos of Oman also announced that he will send an envoy
to represent him.

<HEAD>Teams Fight Over Rules and History, But St. Ubaldo Always Wins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JESSUP, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The only thing certain about the annual
Memorial Day weekend Race of the Saints is that the 800-pound
statue of St. Ubaldo crosses the finish line first.
   Beyond that, there are debates about the rules, about which team
really is the fastest and about why St. Ubaldo is celebrated every
May.
   ``Symbolically, whenever we have the race, it's always 'Baldo
first,'' said Ron Tomko of the Society of St. Anthony.
   This northeastern Pennsylvania town of 5,000 people was settled
by natives of Gubbio, Italy, which claims Ubaldo as its patron
saint. In most years since 1911, teams from the societies of Saints
George and Anthony challenged members of St. Ubaldo to a Race of
the Saints, with each team carrying an 800-pound statue of their
saint atop a platform through the 1{-mile course.
   To honor him, St. Ubaldo always goes first and the rules make it
easy for him to stay out front: each team starts 63 feet apart and
there is no passing.
   The truth, according to Tomko, is that St. Anthony would be the
best in an un-rigged race, but across town, another group claims
superiority.
   ``St. George has always had the strongest team in the race, at
least for the last 10 years,'' said Mario Mariani, a captain of the
St. George's team. ``If you watch the race, you'll see the distance
St. Anthony is behind.''
   The only team not claiming to be the fastest during Saturday's
race was St. Ubaldo's, which was shorthanded and had to stray from
the rules and borrow men from the other teams to help carry its
statue.
   The race is similar to one held the last 799 years in Gubbio on
May 15, the eve of the real St. Ubaldo's Day, with teams carrying
1,200-pound statues over a longer, steeper course.
   The feast is celebrated in Jessup every Memorial Day weekend,
ending at the Jessup Memorial Stadium. In an added twist, each team
dismantles its platform and races its statue up a hillside.
   In this second race, it's anybody's ball game, not just
Ubaldo's. St. Anthony's won the second race Saturday.
   There are several theories on why St. Ubaldo is honored. Most
say Ubaldo rescued Gubbio by negotiating with a barbarian who was
ravaging the Italian countryside or that Ubaldo was a
philanthropist who spread his wealth among townspeople while
accepting a life of poverty for himself.

<HEAD>Residue from Illegally Dumped Chemicals May Have Caused Ship
Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain and two crew members of a Panamanian
ship which exploded in the Houston Ship Channel may have caused the
blast by illegally dumping hazardous chemicals, federal authorities
said.
   The fire started May 11 while the 375-foot chemical tanker Seta
was moored for repairs at Newpark Shipyard. The 25 crewmen aboard
when the Seta exploded jumped into the ship channel.
   Federal authorities think residue from chemicals illegally
dumped into the ship channel may have been ignited by a spark from
a welding torch on an adjacent vessel in dry dock, and the fire
spread to the tanker, said Coast Guard Lt. Mary Landry.
   Cargo tanks had residue from recent hazardous cargoes of
acetone, toluene, caustic soda, mineral spirits, xylene, hexane and
kerosene.
   The captain and two crew members were arrested Friday.
   Goran Bacic, the ship's captain, and Klause Eheler, the port
captain, were charged with felony violation of the Clean Water Act,
which carries up to a $50,000 fine and three years in prison,
officials said.
   Doran Prpic, the second-ranking officer, was charged with a
misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act.
   Bacic and Prpic are Yugoslavian, and Eheler is German, officials
said. They were released on bond, which was set at $100,000 on the
felony charges and $25,000 on the misdemeanor charge, officials
said.
   The ship channel was closed to regular traffic while
firefighters battled the blaze for 12 hours. Three crew members
were burned and several firefighters suffered heat stroke.
   The Coast Guard, FBI and federal Environmental Protection Agency
are conducting a joint investigation, FBI spokesman Charles B.
Kearney said.
   The fire caused an estimated $2 million in damage, but Ms.
Landry said there was little environmental harm.

<HEAD>Death Row Inmate Suing to Worship Satan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man scheduled to be the first
Arkansas death row inmate executed in more than a quarter century
is suing the state over his right to worship the devil.
   But officials see the suit as just another ploy by John Edward
Swindler to stay alive.
   Swindler is to be put to death June 18 for the 1976 shooting
death of a Fort Smith police officer. Because he was sentenced
before the state switched its method of executions, Swindler has
the choice of dying in the electric chair or by lethal injection,
the state standard.
   No Arkansas prisoner has been put to death since 1964. Earlier
this month, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to consider Swindler's
appeal. A district court judge then granted the state's motion to
withdraw a 9-year-old stay of execution in the case.
   Swindler, who has sued the prison system numerous times over
alleged mistreatment on death row, has joined another inmate's
lawsuit against prison officials for being prohibited from reading
the satanic bible.
   Prison officials contend Swindler is trying use the lawsuit as
another roadblock to his execution.
   ``He'll attack the system in any way he can,'' prison spokesman
David White said recently. ``I don't think he shows any strong
religious inclinations.''
   But Swindler, who is at the state's maximum-security unit in
Tucker in southeastern Arkansas, adamantly lays claims to his
religious roots.
   ``I am a Satanist,'' he wrote in a letter to a reporter last
summer. He said he and fellow inmate John E. Campbell ``will let
the prison administrators know we are true Satanists and want the
right to practice my faith and worship my lord Lucifer.''
   ``To me it shows their lack of their faith in their God of
Christianity when they refuse my religion,'' Swindler wrote.
   Court records show that in his last hearing in federal court,
Swindler told jurors he was a Quaker.
   Campbell, who is serving a life sentence at the maximum-security
unit for aggravated robbery and attempted murder, filed the
original lawsuit in December 1988, and Swindler intervened later.
   Named as defendants are Prison Director A.L. ``Art'' Lockhart,
warden Larry Norris and prison chaplain Dennis Pigman.
   Campbell is seeking permission to read the satanic bible and to
wear a mail-order medallion, in addition to $330,000 in damages.
Swindler also wants to read the satanic bible and asks that the
prison create satanic religious services.
   Federal law authorizes prison wardens to censor prisoners'
reading materials if the materials are deemed disruptive.
   White said he could not comment on pending litigation, but
acknowledged that the warden had prohibited the prisoners from
reading the satanic bible.
   Swindler is on death row for the murder of Fort Smith police
officer Randy Basnett. He also was convicted of murdering two South
Carolina teen-agers and is suspected in the death of a young
hitchhiker in Florida.

   Soviet soldiers killed at least six people in a
clash Sunday at a train station in Yerevan, the capital of the
restive republic of Armenia. Ten government troopers and two other
people were reported wounded.
   The official Tass news agency said the violence broke out when
militants opened fire on a group of soldiers returning from a
patrol.
   However, a spokesman for an Armenian group said the soldiers had
started the clash by opening fire. He said 15 people were killed.
   The attack was the latest violence in the tense Caucasus
republic, but the first time the clashes spread to a public place
in Yerevan.
   Ten Interior Ministry soldiers were wounded in the shooting,
three critically, and one civilian bystander was hospitalized with
bullet wounds, Tass said.
   The soldiers were attacked by about 15 armed men when they
returned from escorting a passenger train to Kafan, 120 miles
southeast of Yerevan, Tass said.
   The southeastern corner of Armenia near Kafan has become one of
the tensest areas in the dispute between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   ``The personnel, exercising their right to repulse an attack,
returned fire,'' Tass said. ``Five militants were killed and two
were injured in the shootout. One of the injured soon died.''
   Tass provided no other details. Officials of the Interior
Ministry in Yerevan said they were not authorized to release
information.
   Unrest continued throughout the day in Yerevan, as crowds of up
to 50,000 people roamed the streets after the shooting incident,
according to a duty officer at the Armenian National Movement in
Yerevan who was contacted by telephone.
   The spokesman, who declined to give his name, blamed soldiers
for starting the incident by firing on a group of Armenians.
   The Armenian spokesman put the death toll at 15, including one
young woman. It was impossible to determine which version of events
was correct.
   Armenia has been locked in a bitter dispute for more than two
years with Azerbaijan over control of Nagorno-Karabakh. That region
is predominantly ethnic Armenian, but legally belongs to Azerbaijan.
   Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds of
thousands have been forced to flee their homes in more than two
years of ethnic attacks and clashes between civilians and soldiers.
   Soviet soldiers are stationed in both republics to quell
violence, but militants on both sides see the troops as an
occupying force.
   The shootout came three days after militants fired on soldiers
at military checkpoints and on a patrol in Nagorno-Karabakh,
killing one serviceman and wounding four. Tass said soldiers killed
one attacker and wounded six.

<TEXT>
   Poles voted Sunday for community councils
nationwide and were expected to push forward the country's
democratic revolution by ousting Communists from their last
bastions of power.
   The vote was the first fully free ballot since World War II and
aims to reinstitute local governments that are entirely autonomous
of Warsaw. That system was not allowed under four decades of
Communist Party rule.
   Unofficial results of the 52,000 individual races were expected
on Monday, but official results were not expected until Wednesday.
   Solidarity Citizens Committees are expected to dominate local
governments, but the vote will be a test of the country's budding
independent political parties.
   ``The vast majority of society _ although angry at the bad
(economic) situation _ understands that we must stick together
because there is no other choice,'' Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa
said after voting near Gdansk. ``We must take over power from the
bottom and build the foundations of democracy.''
   Voting in Warsaw, Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki said the
balloting was fundamental: ``Local government elections will not
change the economic situation. But we can say they are changing the
system.''
   Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski said the vote ``finally
will anchor democracy to the very bottom, to the grassroots. ...
After this, our changes will be truly irreversible.''
   In previous local elections held under the Communists, only
those candidates approved by party-dominated nominating boards were
allowed to run. The local councils, considered the agents of the
central government, depended on Warsaw for money and their
decisions could be overturned.
   The election of local officials answerable to residents and not
to Warsaw should make administration of towns and villages more
efficient, Mazowiecki said.
   More than 146,000 candidates from about 80 parties were vying
nationwide. Official posters outside polling places listed the
names of district candidates and the parties they represented.
   ``Finally we have real elections, and I went to all those
elections before, so I know the difference,'' said Jozef Szewicz, a
doctor leaving a polling station with his wife.
   ``Thank God that I lived to see this,'' said Janina Krakowska,
who worked on a farm in the town of Wiskitki until she retired.
   There was little of the enthusiasm displayed during last June's
partly free parliamentary elections, when Solidarity plastered
towns with posters and manned stands outside polling places.
Politicking was illegal Sunday.
   The final turnout was 42 percent nationwide, according to the
General Election Commission. In June's parliamentary elections, the
turnout was 62 percent.
   ``There were fewer preparations, fewer posters because we didn't
want people to say we were wasting money,'' said Maria Simiatowska
of the Solidarity Citizens Committee in Skierniewice, a provincial
capital 30 miles southwest of Warsaw.
   The June parliamentary vote was governed by an agreement between
Solidarity and the former Communist government. The accord reserved
65 percent of the seats in the lower house of parliament, the Sejm,
for the Communists and their allies, and 35 percent for non-party
independents.
   In that vote, Solidarity candidates won all non-party seats by
wide margins. In August Solidarity took over a coalition
government, the first non-Communist leadership in the East bloc.
   Since then, an entirely new system of local government has been
drafted and approved by parliament. Local governments will be given
one-fifth of the central government's vast property and will be
empowered to raise and spend revenues independently of Warsaw.
   Mazowiecki and Walesa have both called for parliamentary
elections next spring in which no seats would be set aside for any
political party.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in an interview
broadcast Sunday in the Soviet Union, said ``we've got big
differences'' with Mikhail S. Gorbachev over German unity and
Lithuania that could impede this week's superpower summit.
   While hailing Gorbachev as a statesman, Bush said, ``He may be
mad with me over some things because we do have some differences.''
   Bush said he would not try to exploit any weakness suffered by
Gorbachev because of economic problems and ethnic unrest in the
Soviet Union.
   ``I think that when you sit down with a respected world leader,
it's not a question of who is stronger, who is weaker, who has got
bigger problems, who has got less problems,'' the president said.
   He promised to treat the Soviet people and their leader ``with
the respect that they deserve.''
   Bush said that ``If we argue, we'll do that pleasantly. He's a
tough guy. Listen, I've been around him enough to know that he
drives his point home.
   ``Well, I can do the same thing,'' Bush said. ``And I think it's
important that I level with him _ here's what's in my heart, here's
our policy.''
   Gorbachev went on television Sunday night to appeal for calm
amid panic in the Soviet Union over imminent food price hikes.
Bush, as he finished a round of golf Sunday, was asked about
Gorbachev's appeal. ``It's a big problem,'' said Bush.
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet at the White House beginning
Thursday. On Friday, they are to sign an agreement to destroy
chemical weapons and outline limits on cruise missiles, which have
been an obstacle to agreement on a strategic nuclear weapons pact.
   The two leaders will go to the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md., on Saturday for more talks and then conduct a wrapup
news conference Sunday at the White House.
   In a round of pre-summit jockeying, Bush administration leaders
and a Soviet official made appearances Sunday on television talk
shows.
   Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said it would
be impossible for the superpowers to sign an agreement banning
long-range missiles although the two sides are making progress on
negotiations.
   But Scowcroft said arms control will not be the focus of the
summit.
   ``The fundamental issues are talking about remaking the
political map of Europe and also, secondarily, what is going on it
the Soviet Union,'' Scowcroft said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With
David Brinkley.''
   Scowcroft was also adamant that the United States would not
grant trade benefits, known as most favored nation status, to the
Soviet Union until the Moscow passes immigration laws that allow
citizens to leave the country freely.
   Bush, who arrived here Friday for a four-day, pre-summit
vacation, was interviewed Thursday at the White House by Soviet TV
correspondent Valentin Zorin for a Sunday night broadcast in the
Soviet Union. A text of Bush's remarks was released here.
   Bush spoke repeatedly of obstacles in U.S.-Soviet relations,
particularly coercion of Lithuania and German unity. ``And so we've
got big differences on some of these questions. ...
   ``We've got some problems in the Baltic states that inhibit
total openness here,'' the president said.
   ``We've got some problems in what we think _ reforms need to be
taking place before we can have the full exchange of economic
interests there.''
   Gorbachev, in an interview published in this week's issue of
Time magazine, said the German unity question was certain to
produce a major disagreement with Bush.
   But, Gorbachev said, ``I do expect the differences to be
narrowed.''
   Bush said he would try to convince Gorbachev there would be no
threat to the Soviet Union from having a united Germany in the
U.S.-led NATO alliance. However, Soviet and American officials held
out little hope that Gorbachev could be persuaded.
   ``I didn't say we could,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' program. ``I said we will have
to try because the position we have is very firmly held and we're
not going to come off of that position.''
   Soviet Politburo member Aleksandr Yakovlev, reflecting Moscow's
fears of a militarily strong Germany, said, ``We shall do
everything in our power to guarantee to the Soviet Union, to the
Soviet people, that no war will ever start from the German soil,
that there will be no threat to our people.
   ``That is our principal concern and we turn to the West, we
appeal to the West, to take this point of view of the Soviet Union
into account,'' said Yakovlev, an adviser to Gorbachev. He was
interviewed on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   Bush said ``I want to convince Mr. Gorbachev _ with whom I can
talk freely, he's the kind of man you can very frankly with _ that
a U.S. presence in Europe, a unified Germany, a Germany in NATO not
only is no threat to the Soviet Union, but preserves the kind of
stable Europe that the Soviets should welcome.''
   He called Soviet pressure against the breakaway republic of
Lithuania an issue that is ``troubling that I don't want to sweep
under this rug. ...
   ``And I have to have him understand the constraints on any U.S.
president until self-determination is visible and forthcoming
there.''

<DATELINE>CITY OF INDUSTRY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man apparently died while
visiting a spiritual medium, who then spent a week trying to revive
him, authorities said.
   Horn Kim Chhim, 50, suffered from a stomach ailment but did not
believe in doctors, authorities said Saturday. His body was to
undergo an autopsy Monday or Tuesday.
   Authorities said it was unlikely the medium would be charged
with any crime.
   ``There was strange activity, but nothing criminal,'' said Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Scott Coleman. The medium was not
identified and his beliefs and practices were not described.
   He said relatives told sheriff's investigators that Chhim was
suffering from a stomach ailment when he was taken to the medium's
home on May 18 ``for religious reasons.''
   Although authorities were uncertain of the date of Chhim's
death, it appeared that he was with the medium when he died,
officials said. The medium then asked the family to allow him to
keep the corpse in an attempt to restore the dead man's spirit.
   ``Apparently the medium told the family he could bring the body
back to life, and after they gave it to him for a week and the body
didn't come back to life, he gave it back,'' Coleman said.
   On Friday, family members called paramedics to the dead man's
home in this city just east of Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Niagara Falls Jet Boat Capsizes, Throwing Seven Into Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>QUEENSTON, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A controversial tour boat capsized
Sunday in rapids a few hundred yards below Niagara Falls, throwing
seven people into the cold waters of the Niagara River.
   No one aboard the 23-foot jet boat was seriously hurt, according
to Niagara Parks Police Constable Steve Kelly. Two people,
including a Yugoslavian tourist, were treated at Greater Niagara
General Hospital for hypothermia and released, a nursing supervisor
said.
   Three passengers on the Jet Boat International tour swam to
safety on the U.S. side of the river below the bridge connecting
Queenston and Lewiston, N.Y.
   ``We hit the (rapids) and we then came back again to have
another go at it and that's when we went over,'' passenger John
Swan said.
   The company started its Niagara River tours two weeks ago
despite warnings from U.S. and Canadian authorities it would not be
safe.
   Swan, president of a winery in nearby Niagara-on-the-Lake, said
he didn't know what caused the accident.
   ``All of a sudden I was under the boat,'' he said. ``I gradually
made my way to the shore ...''
   Canadian and U.S. rescue teams and a tourist helicopter company
helped rescue the seven people.
   Jet Boat International owner Jim McLean declined to comment on
the accident.
   When Jet Boat International started its excursions for
``thrill-seekers,'' a senior marine surveyor for the Canadian Coast
Guard said he was skeptical about whether the waters were safe
enough to navigate.
   Canadian and American law prohibit anyone from launching boats
into the Niagara River from public lands, but the company got
around the regulation by launching its craft from a private yacht
club.
   The company is the first to operate tours on the river since
three people were killed in 1975.

   Freed hostage Frank Reed's joyous reunion
Sunday with his 91-year-old mother was tempered with an urgent plea
for the speedy release of the six Americans still held captive.
   ``They aren't well,'' he implored after arriving at Boston's
Logan International Airport. ``They are sick. I promise you they
are sick. Let us not forget them.''
   Reed, who has been undergoing medical tests at Andrews Air Force
Base in Maryland, saw his mother for the first time in eight years
in a tearful airport reunion before meeting reporters.
   ``He said to me, `You're a great mother.' We shed tears of
joy,'' said Leota Sprague, who was too weak to join her son
earlier. ``I say rejoice, give thanks.''
   ``She looks lovely,'' said Reed with his mother at his side. She
was in a wheelchair.
   The Reed family, including his wife, Fahima, and 9-year-old son,
Tarek, traveled by motorcade to his daughter's house in this suburb
just north of Boston, where cheering neighbors and 100 yellow
ribbons awaited the hometown celebrity. The suburb of 56,000
planned a parade for Reed on Tuesday.
   Reed, 57, was released April 30 after 44 months in captivity in
Lebanon. He was home for a brief Memorial Day break but was
scheduled to return Wednesday to the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.
   Reed said doctors were trying to do some ``medical sleuthing''
to find out why he is so anemic.
   ``We're trying to do some things to verify the contusions and
results of the beatings I had for trying to escape twice, not
really being left alone until a few months ago,'' Reed said.
``Despite it all, they say my heart's fine, my lungs are fine, my
liver's fine.''
   Reed also spoke out on behalf of the other hostages he said were
in ill health. His comments contradicted those he made at a
Washington news conference May 6, when he told reporters the
American hostages ``look physically wonderful.''
   ``Terry Anderson is not well,'' he said of the longest held of
the hostages. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is in his sixth year of captivity.
   ``Thomas Sutherland is not well,'' added Reed, who last saw the
hostages more than a year ago. ``And I told the people in
Washington that they are not well. We must do something. We must
get the other hostages free somehow.''
   Reed's spokesman and attorney, Bob Woolf, deflected further
questions about the hostages' conditions and the U.S. government's
attempts to secure their freedom.
   ``This weekend we are memorializing the dead that fought for our
country,'' said Reed, who was flanked by family members at the
airport news conference. ``Let us hope that one day we don't have
to have a day to memorialize the hostages that are dead or will
die.''
   The other Americans still held hostage are Joseph James
Cicippio, 59, who was acting comptroller at the American University
in Beirut; Edward Austin Tracy, 59, a west Beirut resident; Alann
Steen, 51, a communications instructor at Beirut University
College, and Jesse Jonathan Turner, 42, a professor of mathematics
and computer science at Beirut University College.
   A banner hanging in front of the home of Reed's daughter,
Marilyn Langston, read, ``Free at Last _ Frank Reed, April 30,
1990.'' Reed has two grown daughters from a previous marriage.
   Langston said her father had not been in Malden, where he grew
up, since he made a week-long visit in March 1982.
   She said the visit would mark the first time her father had ever
seen his granddaughter _ her 6-year-old daughter, Stacy _ and only
the second time he had seen her 8-year-old son, Nathan.
   Reed, who has gained 18 pounds since returning to the United
States, has been playing golf and dreaming of the lobster dinner he
was planning to enjoy Sunday night with family members in Malden.
   Reed was head of the private Lebanese International School when
he was snatched from his car by gunmen near the Beirut Airport in
1986.
   He was freed eight days after another American hostage, Robert
Polhill, was released. Polhill remains hospitalized, undergoing
treatment for cancer. They were the first Americans to be freed in
3{ years.
   After his release, Reed told reporters his Moslem kidnappers
double-chained him to a wall or radiator, broke his nose, jaw and
ribs, slightly fractured his feet with iron rods and bloodied his
kidneys for twice trying to escape.
   Some military and administration officials have said there may
be discrepancies in Reed's accounts of his captivity, and relatives
said he was having problems with his short-term memory.
   Woolf, an attorney to celebrities and sports stars who said he
had been asked to act as Reed's spokesman, said the freed hostage
would likely remain hospitalized ``at least two more weeks'' after
returning to the medical center.
   Woolf said Reed wanted to complete the doctoral work he had
started at Boston College and continue his career as an educator.
   Reed has been ``deluged'' with movie and book offers and is very
interested in writing about his experiences, Woolf said.
   ``Just listening to his experiences, I can see there's a great
book in this,'' Woolf said.

   A family of six is trying hard to regard a
possible social call from Raisa Gorbachev as something like a visit
from a ``dear aunt.''
   But the Watsons acknowledge they're thinking a lot about what
they'll wear, whether they'll offer Mrs. Gorbachev something to eat
and what they'll chat about with reporters and security officials
nearby.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife said they
would like to visit a home during their six-hour stay in the Twin
Cities area next Sunday.
   The home of Steve and Karen Watson and their four children was
recommended partly because their 13-year-old daughter, Lisa,
performed in Moscow last year in an exchange between the Children's
Theater Co. of Minneapolis and a Moscow children's theater.
   The Gorbachevs' itinerary has not been released, but the Watsons
must prepare as if they were certain they'll be entertaining one or
both.
   Karen Watson, 38, said a public relations expert gave them some
advice.
   ``She told us to view it as a dear aunt coming to visit and keep
it simple,'' Mrs. Watson said. Still, the Watsons can't shake the
surreal quality of it all.
   ``It feels very strange that we should be given some of their
time,'' Mrs. Watson said. ``We feel very honored and very lucky.''
   Jon Cranney, artistic director of the Children's Theater Co.,
recommended the Watsons to members of Gov. Rudy Perpich's staff,
who were looking for a typical middle-class home Gorbachev could
visit.
   Steve Watson, 39, teaches art at Forest Hills Elementary School
in Eden Prairie.
   Lisa also appeared in ABC-TV's miniseries filmed in the Twin
Cities, ``The Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase,'' which

<TEXT>
   Two Democratic candidates for governor
took to the pulpit in black churches at opposite ends of California
on Sunday as each battled for grassroots support.
   State Attorney General John Van de Kamp unveiled a $7
billion-plus plan in Sacramento to build a ``world class''
passenger rail system in California by the end of the decade. In
Los Angeles, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein stuck to
general themes in get-out-the-vote speeches.
   Van de Kamp's rail plan calls for passage of both Propositions
108 and 116, bond issues on the June 5 ballot that would raise
$2.99 billion. That's enough, Van de Kamp says, to begin a project
to link California's major cities with faster, more convenient
passenger trains.
   ``It is time for this state to catch up to the rest of the world
in rapid transit,'' Van de Kamp said.
   Van de Kamp, who took his campaign entourage on a 3{-hour train
trip from Sacramento to Fresno, said the same distance could be
covered by one of France's high-speed trains in about 80 minutes.
   Ms. Feinstein challenged herself and other politicians to be
like black South African leader Nelson Mandela who, newly released
from prison, must ``chart a course for the future, a course that
says ... you can't deny equal opportunity, a course that says there
has to be a level playing field if people are going to succeed in
this world.''
   She refused to elaborate on her pledge Saturday to make half the
appointments in her administration women and to hire minorities by
a quota system in proportion to their population. California is
projected to be mostly nonwhite in 10 years.
   ``I see bringing people of color into a position of power in
government,'' was all she would tell reporters Sunday.
   As the campaign for the Democratic nomination in the June 5
primary entered its final 10 days, Van de Kamp and Ms. Feinstein
are returning to traditional campaigning with visits to churches.
The two had concentrated earlier on raising funds for television
advertisements.
   Van de Kamp delivered brief campaign speeches to two black
Baptist congregations in Sacramento and a third in nearby North
Highlands, stressing a message of politics as public service.
   ``I'm running because I think it's time we start to love one
another again. I'm running to serve others,'' he told the
congregation at the Antioch Baptist Church.
   ``I'd like it to be said of me someday, that I tried to feed the
hungry _ not only tried but succeeded,'' he continued before the
congregation of St. Paul's Baptist Church.
   Relaxed and gaining confidence at every stop, Ms. Feinstein told
four congregations in the largely poor Watts and south-central
sections of Los Angeles that her administration would bring better
education and more opportunity for their children.
   She warmed to the rousing music and singing at the First African
Methodist Episcopal Church near downtown that featured a choir of
children and teen-age gospel singers.
   ``As we were sitting here getting a little soul, I was looking
into a number of faces and wondering if in 10 years from today will
we have a better state, will we have a safer community,'' she said.
``Will these young people, eyes bright, standing tall ... really be
able to take their full place in a society that promises the
American Dream?''
   The Democratic contest has been marked by sharp shifts in public
opinion.
   Feinstein was well ahead of Van de Kamp in early polls, but the
next round of surveys showed her lagging behind in a double-digit
deficit.
   Next, after she launched a media blitz, another poll moved her
from 18 percentage points behind Van de Kamp to 19 points ahead.
   That lead soon evaporated, however, and a Los Angeles Times poll
released earlier this month had her with a 13-point lead, 37
percent to 24 percent over Van de Kamp. The undecided vote was even
higher, at 38 percent.
   On the Republican side, low-profile candidate Pete Wilson has no
major opposition and is steadily raising money for the November
general election.

<HEAD>Israeli Supreme Court Upholds Conviction of Nuclear Spy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Sunday rejected an appeal
by former nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu, who was convicted of
treason and spying for leaking details of Israel's nuclear weapons
program to a British newspaper.
   The announcement by the three-judge panel was read behind closed
doors, in keeping with the secrecy surrounding the case since
Vanunu was arrested in 1986 after disappearing in London.
   The judges did not make public their reasons for rejecting the
appeal and banned publication of their 89-page verdict. They gave
Vanunu's attorney, Avigdor Feldman, 30 days to appeal the decision.
   Feldman told reporters he plans to ask for a larger panel of
justices to rule on whether ``a man can be accused of treason for
ties with a newspaper.''
   Vanunu captured wideworld attention when The Sunday Times of
London on Oct. 5, 1986, printed information and photographs he
provided.
   The information detailed operations of an Israeli nuclear
reactor near the town of Dimona in the Negev Desert and suggested
that Israel had stockpiled at least 100 nuclear weapons and had the
capability to produce neutron and hydrogen bombs.
   Israel has never responded directly to those allegations, and
officials would only say that Israel will not be the first to
introduce atomic weapons into the Middle East.
   Vanunu was convicted of treason and espionage in December 1988
and sentenced to 18 years in prison.
   During his trial, Vanunu testified he made his revelations to
the newspaper to alert the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons
_ not for personal gain or out of a desire to harm his country.
   Vanunu is being held in solitary confinement.

   Labor experts estimate that 5,000 to 10,000
children, many of them working grueling hours in hazardous
conditions, are illegally employed in the city's garment industry
every day, the Daily News reported Sunday.
   The trend has reached a level not seen since the turn of the
century, when there were no child labor laws, the News said. It
comes as apparel manufacturers struggle to compete with their
rivals in Asia, where labor costs are lower.
   Ninety-nine percent of the minors are documented or undocumented
aliens from Mexico, Latin America and Asia. They often are paid off
the books, well below the minimum wage of $3.80 an hour.
   ``The situation is out of control and beyond the reach of
regulation,'' said Stanley Aronowitz, a labor expert at City
University.
   In the first three months of this year, the state Labor
Department's Apparel Industry Task Force found 90 Garment District
factories illegally employing 128 minors. It was the largest number
of violators nabbed in any three-month period by the task force,
which was created in 1987.
   The number of children documented as illegally employed in the
city soared more than 900 percent, from 90 to 819, between 1983 and
1989, according to the state Labor Department.
   But task force officials said tracking down violators is an
arduous, often frustrating job. There are 3,500 registered garment
manufacturers in the city and an equal number that are unregistered
and illegal. The task force has 24 investigators.
   The newspaper described how three children, illegal aliens from
Mexico, worked 11 hours in a room filled with electrical hazards,
solvent fumes, poor ventilation and fire hazards.
   The News said some teen-age alien workers seen during a task
force sweep of eight garment operations last week appeared strained
by the monotonous work and dilapidated surroundings. But others
appeared content and conscientious. For them, even those conditions
were better than no work.
   There also are widespread child labor law violations at
restaurants, supermarkets and laundries, said Richard Polsinello,
director of labor standards for the state Labor Department.

   A solar-powered commuter car Sunday won
a 234-mile race against other sun-fueled vehicles and a free ride
to an international competition in Switzerland, organizers said.
   The Solectria Lightspeed produced by Solectria Corp. of
Arlington took first place in the commuter category with a time of
8.2 hours, crossing the finish line behind the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in this Boston suburb.
   Fifteen solar-powered cars began the second annual race in
Fairlee, Vt., on Wednesday. The commuter category consisted of
useable two- and four-seaters, said race co-director Nancy Hazard.
   ``What we are really trying to promote is the development and
use of commuter cars,'' Hazard said.
   The Solectria Lightspeed, driver Anita Rajan, and its crew will
be flown to the Tour de Sol in June by Lufthansa German Airlines,
said Rosemarie Van Camp, a Tufts official.
   Solectria Corp. also finished second in the commuter category
with its Selectria Sunrise, at 8.23 hours.
   In the racing category, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's MIT Solectria 5 finished first at 6.2 hours.
   The Dartmouth Sunvox II came in second for solar racers at 7.9
hours.
   The University of California at Irvine's Solaris was the only
entry in the cross-continental category. The car completed the race.
   The race was sponsored by the Northeast Solar Energy Association
and private corporations, Hazard said.

   Police fired tear gas Sunday and
stormed a university to break up an anti-government rally by more
than 4,000 teachers, students and dissidents.
   About a dozen protesters and police were injured in the clashes
that lasted about 30 minutes. More than 20 protesters were detained.
   Authorities shot the tear gas from black armored vans, and about
800 riot police staged two raids on Kyunghee University.
   About 3,000 primary, middle and high school teachers were
holding a rally there to protest the dismissals last year of about
5,000 teachers for involvement in an outlawed union.
   When police moved in firing tear gas Sunday, most of the
teachers fled, but hundreds of students fought back with stones and
firebombs.
   The rally marked the first anniversary of the founding of the
outlawed National Teachers' Union.
   Protesters said teachers need an independent union to guard
schools from government influence. They claimed Korea's past
dictatorial governments used the educational system to justify its
policies.
   In downtown Seoul, meanwhile, about 1,000 students mounted
scattered anti-government street demonstrations.
   Police fired tear gas to break up the protests, and students
hurled firebombs at the police. There were no reports of arrests.

<HEAD>Mohawks Stage Peaceful Protest Over Police Presence on Reservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. REGIS INDIAN RESERVATION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 250 Mohawks
staged a peaceful protest Sunday against the continued presence of
police on this reservation.
   ``Basically, you still have martial law, even though they are
allowing outside traffic to go through,'' said Harold Oakes, a
spokesman for the protesters.
   The demonstration took place on the U.S. side of the 28,000-acre
reservation, which covers parts of New York and the Canadian
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
   U.S. and Canadian police moved onto the reservation May 1 after
two Mohawk men were shot dead in a feud between pro- and
anti-gambling factions.
   New York state troopers allowed outside traffic onto the reserve
late last week for the first time since March. However, they
continue to stop and search vehicles within the reserve, and
Ontario and Quebec provincial police continue to patrol Canadian
sections of the reservation.
   Oakes said the situation is bad for businesses along Route 37,
the reservation's main thoroughfare. The route, which bisects
Indian land, is dotted with gas stations and restaurants, as well
as the controversial casinos, which remain closed.
   ``We're still not sure whether the presence of armed police is
going to have a negative effect on traffic through here,'' Oakes
said. ``They might not stop here.''
   The demonstrators also were protesting the release Wednesday of
Doug George on $15,000 bail. George, the anti-gambling editor of
the reservation's two newspapers, has been charged with
second-degree murder in the May 1 shooting near Snye, Quebec, of
Harold Edwards, 33, who was neutral in the gambling dispute.
   Quebec police are still investigating the May 1 shooting death
of 22-year-old Matthew Pyke, who opposed gambling.
   Following Sunday's protest, the crowd gathered at a bingo hall
for what turned out to be a rally for Norman Tarbell, who is
running against Harold Tarbell in the June 2 election for the head
chief of the Tribal Council that governs the U.S. side of the
reserve. The two are not related.
   Harold Tarbell is the only one of the three chiefs on the
council who opposes gambling, and Oakes said his defeat would help
solve the crisis.
   ``We believe they will start listening to the will of the people
instead of letting things linger and fester,'' he said.
   The gambling feud has been simmering since late last July, when
the FBI and New York state police raided the casinos and
confiscated scores of slot machines.
   Mohawk traditionalists claim that gambling goes against the
Mohawk way of life; gambling supporters say the casinos bring
needed revenue and jobs to the reservation.

   A luxury liner with 1,360 people aboard lost
power and ran aground Sunday, but instead of triggering panic, it
was a chance to ``party hardy a little longer,'' passengers said.
   Nobody was in danger, the Coast Guard reported, and passengers
on the 642-foot Regent Star said they were enjoying free champagne
cocktails supplied by the crew.
   Initial attempts to free the ship with tugboats failed and the
Coast Guard said another attempt would have to wait until high
tide, about 2 p.m. Monday.
   The tugs were going to try at high tide after midnight Sunday,
but Lt. James Weakley said the Coast Guard felt ``it would be
better to try it in daylight'' for safety reasons.
   The shipping company, Regency Shipping, must pay for the
operation, but the Coast Guard will supervise, he said.
   A small electrical fire in a switchboard apparently caused the
power failure around 1 a.m. on what was to be the last day of a
seven-day trip from Montego Bay, Jamaica, to Philadelphia. The
Regent Star drifted into a sandbar 22 miles north of Cape May in
the Delaware Bay separating Delaware and New Jersey, according to
Petty Officer John Brazell, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   ``The lights went out in the disco, everybody was singing `Hot,
hot hot,''' Kathleen Hopkins, a reporter at the Elizabeth Daily
Journal who was on board, said by phone.
   Later, they sang Christmas carols and played an improvised
version of ``The Newlywed Game.''
   ``People started chanting `Drinks, drinks drinks,''' and free
mimosas started flowing, Hopkins said. ``Nobody's really scared,
everybody is having a good time.''
   ``I think it's fun, one big party,'' said Brian Forman, a
computer consultant from Philadelphia. ``The party is never going
to end.''
   ``It just gave us a great opportunity to party hardy a little
longer,'' Barbara Sowden of Wilmington, Del., said by phone. ``We
don't need a band, we make our own music.''
   The Coast Guard directed marine traffic away from the area.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told
graduating students at Scranton University on Sunday that Americans
must encourage freedom around the world to allow other nations to
copy ``democracy's grand design.''
   ``We, both by example and exhortation, have the opportunity,
indeed the responsibility, to offer our best hopes for freedom to
this awakening world,'' Thornburgh told a crowd of 7,000 at the
commencement.
   ``We must provide maximum exposure to our democratic culture and
the traditions of our political philosophy _ so that other nations
may emulate democracy's grand design, which is to elevate the
dignity of the individual and then respect, absolutely, that
individual's rights and liberties.
   ``We must remind ourselves of the abiding commitment that
democracy has made to increase individual rights, to assure due
process, and to fine-tune our system so that we maintain that
precarious balance between freedom and security,'' Thornburgh said.
   Thornburgh, who served two terms as Pennsylvania's governor,
told the students that every citizen can help change occur.
   ``I will grant you a healthy skepticism about your ability to
right all the world's wrongs, but make sure that what you express
is skepticism and not cynicism,'' he said.
   ``It is within your reach to raise new standards for yourselves
and the nation. Grasp this challenge firmly, and do everything you
can to move the world ahead.''
   The university conferred 919 undergraduate degrees at the
ceremony.

<TEXT>
   The president of the Children's Defense
Fund urged Yale University seniors Sunday to build a more just
society, and told them to remember even small efforts count.
   ``Enough fleas biting strategically can make even the biggest
dog uncomfortable,'' said Marian Wright Edelman.
   Edelman, the first woman chosen by Yale seniors to be their
Class Day speaker, told the students they will be graduating Monday
into an ``ethically polluted nation'' where the standard for
success is too often ``personal greed rather than public good.''
   ``I hope America redefines what success means in the 1990s,''
she said.
   She gave the seniors the same stern advice she said she is
passing on to her three children.
   ``Never just work for money,'' she said. ``Don't confuse wealth
and fame for character. Never confuse morality with legality. Don't
condone corruption. Don't do just as little as you can to get by.''
   Eldeman is a 1963 graduate of Yale Law School and founder of the
Washington-based Children's Defense Fund, an advocacy group for
children's rights.
   Class Day at Yale is filled with traditions. As has been the
custom since the 1860s, each member of the graduating class was
given a long clay pipe and packet of tobacco. Each student was also
given a white handkerchief to wave at the conclusion of the singing
of ``Bright College Years,'' which ends with the line, ``For God,
for Country, and for Yale!''
   The Ivy Ode, delivered over the years in languages ranging from
Lithuanian to Classical Chinook, was read in Armenian this year
while other seniors carried on the nearly 140-year-old tradition of
the planting of the Class Ivy.

<HEAD>Pope Says Christianity Must Play Major Role in New Europe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Touring the ancient shrines of this
Mediterranean crossroads, Pope John Paul II said Sunday that
Christianity must play a central role in the new Europe emerging
after the collapse of Communist rule.
   The concept of a united Europe based on recognition of Christian
roots has been a major theme of the pope in recent months, and he
raised it again on this island he called ``a marvelous symbiosis of
European and Mediterranean culture.''
   As evidence of Malta's historic position as a crossroads of
civilizations, he pointed to its playing host to the U.S.-Soviet
superpower summit in December.
   John Paul, who returned to Rome on Sunday night at the end of
his three-day visit to Malta, said recent changes in Europe show
``the inadequacy and failure of a culture which was not built on
the primacy of the spiritual dimension of the human person.''
   ``The present challenge facing Europe is to rediscover its own
deepest roots. In accepting this challenge, European culture is
forcefully called to account for the Christian faith that gave form
to its peoples,'' the pope told a group of professors, writers and
other cultural figures on Malta.
   The Vatican says 99 percent of Malta's 350,000 people are Roman
Catholics, and John Paul has repeatedly stressed that church values
were the island's ``most precious inheritance.''
   Maltese marked the first visit ever by a pope as a giant
holiday, setting off fireworks and booming cannon salutes wherever
John Paul visited.
   On Sunday, John Paul prayed at St. Paul's Grotto, where Maltese
say the apostle was shipwrecked in the year 60 and founded the
first Christian community.
   The Polish-born pope's enthusiasm for the changes in Eastern
Europe has been tempered by wariness for what he calls a ``narrow
sense of spiritual inspiration'' among peoples.
   ``Men and women of culture that you are, you know that the
restoration of external freedoms is only the first stage, the first
step,'' he said Sunday. ``The exercise of freedom must be
accompanied by a growth in moral and spiritual maturity.''
   Addressing youths in a soccer stadium on Sunday, John Paul
called for reconciliation in Maltese society, an apparent reference
to bitter quarrels between supporters of the island's two political
parties.
   A papal visit to Malta would have been considered unthinkable
under the previous socialist administration, which had sought to
reduce the church's dominant role.
   The Malta trip was the 48th foreign tour of John Paul's papacy.
His next scheduled trip is to Africa in September.

   The advance word about ``Pioneer'' was
that the play was full of profanity and that it attacked the images
of famed explorers, suggesting base motives rather than heroism.
   But ``Pioneer,'' which premiered Saturday at the Spoleto
Festival, is more amiable than that. And, surprisingly for an
avant-garde play with music and performance art, it's easy to
follow.
   ``Pioneer'' was brought to the regional arts festival by the
Paul Dresher Ensemble, based in San Francisco.
   At the second of four performances Sunday afternoon, perhaps the
worst that could be said is that it would have more impact if it
lasted an hour instead of an hour and a half.
   ``Pioneer'' is rather fun, with pulleys enabling lots of stage
effects, such as the stacking of five sofas so an actor could scale
them like a mountain.
   The story is mostly about Junior, son of a minor explorer, lost
five miles into the forzen north. Junior dies and has his body
frozen. Rinde Eckert gets one of the arias dotted through the
music, singing, ``100 years from now I'll still be 52.''
   Jo Harvey Allen, his widow, has the most talking. Wearing a
short black slip, she has the first of the few speeches vulgarity,
when she describes the kind of man Junior expected her to take home
before he was even cold.
   Junior was a history buff, and we get ``Cortes Explains Religion
to the Natives,'' with John Duykers singing in Spanish and
``explaining'' that the Pope is boss and the natives must do
everything he says.
   There's also an amusing scene in which Adm. Robert Peary is
mostly concerned with how he will look in pictures of his travels.
Neither he nor the photographer has brought a flag to the North
Pole.
   That's about it for debunking explorers.
   The widow has a hard time, too depressed to get out of bed.
Finally she picks up Duykers, who has several arias and plays
several characters. He tears up the floorboards of her house,
looking for whatever treasure Junior hid, and leaving the worst
mess we've ever seen at a final curtain.
   ``Pioneer'' has a happy ending, with the widow getting in a car
and driving off to resume living.
   The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. began Friday night with a concert
celebrating the festival's survival of last fall's Hurricane Hugo.
The Gaillard Auditorium, site of the concert, and Garden Theater,
which houses ``Pioneer,'' were the most badly damaged of the
festival's 11 performance sites. Both have been refurbished.
   Leonard Bernstein was ill and canceled his engagement to conduct
the opening concert.
   The highlight of the performances arranged to take his place was
Midori, the 18-year-old violinist. With her came Julius Rudel,
who'd conducted her in the Bruch ``Scottish Fantasy'' before.
Mezzo-soprano Tatiana Troyanos, more dramatic in concert than
opera, also arrived on short notice.

<HEAD>Bob, Dolores Hope Receive Honorary Degrees at Commencement</HEAD>

   Commencement at the University of San Diego
doubtless would have been a solemn occasion Sunday, if not for the
class cutup.
   ``I love commencement. I love the happy, ecstatic, joyous faces
_ but enough about the teachers,'' comedian Bob Hope told about
9,000 people attending the ceremony.
   ``The parents also look so happy,'' he said. ``This is the last
payment that they'll have to make on their children.''
   Hope, 86, and his wife, Dolores, were presented with honorary
Doctor of Humane Letters degrees amidst wild cheers and applause.
   Before receiving their degrees, the Hopes were lauded by
university officials for their humanitarian and philanthropic
endeavors.
   Hope then took center stage. The audience roared and tittered at
his trademark one-liners.
   ``I'm now a doctor, at last I can get on the golf course on
Wednesdays,'' he said.
   Hope's acceptance speech took on a serious tone as he told the
more than 700 students receiving degrees that their ``real
education is about to begin.''
   ``You've gotten the last grades you'll ever get in geometry,
history and English Lit,'' Hope said. ``From now on, you'll be
attending a far bigger and more important classroom, where your
grades will determine how far you will go in devotion, compassion
and self-respect. That will be the important curriculum from now on.
   ``Cicero said, `A room without books is like a body without a
soul,''' Hope said.
   ``I'll never forget when he told me that,'' the comedian added.
   Dolores Hope, who was celebrating her 81st birthday Sunday, also
drew chuckles from the crowd.
   She thanked the university for honoring her and for ``having Bob
Hope as an opening act.''

<HEAD>Performers Denied Visas to Stage Tiananmen Memorial in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven members of a Hong Kong theater troupe have
been denied visas to enter the United States to stage a production
marking the Tiananmen Square massacre.
   The seven are stranded in England, where they recently completed
five performances, according to Eleanor Yung, executive director of
the Asian American Art Center, which is sponsoring the New York
performance.
   The piece, called ``Deep Structure,'' was scheduled for June 2
at the Borough of Manhattan Community College in Manhattan.
   A pro-Democracy movement in the People's Republic of China was
crushed last June 4 when hundreds of demonstrators were killed in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square by government troops.
   Four actors from the Zuni Icosohedron troupe were granted visas,
and have been in New York since Thursday.
   The rest were denied visas by the U.S. Embassy in England,
   ``The reason they are giving for the denial is they are afraid
all the members would not return to Hong Kong and would stay in
United States,'' said Ms. Yung.
   All 11 performers were given clearance about a month ago by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to work temporarily in the
United States, Yung said. Yung had also arranged radio and
television interviews for the performers, as well as some
sightseeing, and had scheduled them to leave June 21.
   ``My feeling is it's a very sensitive issue with the Tiananmen
Square memorial,'' she said.
   She noted that President Bush last week extended China's
most-favored nation trading status over the objections of critics
who said China should be punished for suppressing human rights.
   Yung said Bush ``seems to be very cautious in terms of how to
deal with this democracy issue. For us to have a memorial
performance commemorating Tiananmen is contrary to their agenda.''
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of State, Anita Stockman,
referred all questions about the visa denial to the U.S. Embassy in
London. Officials there could not immediately be reached for
comment.
   The theater company, whose name refers to an American Indian
tribe and a 25-sided geometric shape, was founded in 1982 in Hong
Kong, where they performed ``Deep Structure'' earlier this year.

<HEAD>Plane Crashes in Missouri, Killing Company President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAYLOR, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A single-engine plane that ``came out of the
clouds without its wings'' crashed Sunday in woods in southeast
Missouri, killing a company president and his wife, officials said.
   The victims were identified as Frank M. Adams, president and
chief operating officer of Morrison Knudsen Corp., and Novella C.
Adams, both 64, of Boise, Idaho.
   Adams had filed a flight plan under which the plane was to fly
from Tennessee to Colorado on Sunday and on to Boise on Monday,
officials said.
   Witnesses reported the crash about four miles northwest of
Naylor around 11:45 a.m., said state Highway Patrol Sgt. J.W.
Burford.
   ``They heard a loud noise and saw a plane come out of the clouds
without its wings,'' Burford said. The victims were declared dead
at the scene.
   The wings of the Piper PA-46 were found about 300 yards south of
the plane's fuselage, the trooper said. There were no storms in the
area, but there was a heavy overcast.
   Authorities said there was no immediate indication of why the
plane's wings came off, but speculated that the aircraft may have
gone into a steep dive for some reason and Adams' efforts to pull
it out put too much strain on the wings.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, Highway Patrol and Ripley
County Sheriff's Office were investigating the crash, Burford said.
   Morrison Knudsen is an international engineering and
construction company with yearly revenues of about $2 billion. It
has built most of Anheuser-Busch's breweries.
   Adams, a Naval Academy graduate and former submarine commander,
retired as president of Allied Signal Corp. in February 1988. He
came out of retirement to go to work for Morrison Knudsen seven
months later.

<HEAD>Mulroney Meets with Premiers, Quebec Crisis Continues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney ended a
series of inconclusive talks Sunday aimed at persuading provincial
premiers to accept an accord recognizing French-speaking Quebec as
a ``distinct society.''
   The refusal of three provinces to support the agreement has
thrown the federal government into a crisis and provoked new fears
of succession efforts by Quebec.
   Emerging from one of the meetings, Newfoundland Premier Clyde
Wells said: ``The differences are substantial and serious and
resolution will not be easy.''
   Mulroney commented: ``Obviously, we have serious problems.''
   Mulroney is hoping to salvage what is known as the Meech Lake
agreement before its June 23 deadline.
   Quebec refused to sign Canada's 1982 constitution. To win its
support, Mulroney and all 10 premiers signed a five-point amendment
at Meech Lake, near Ottawa, in 1987, and set a three-year deadline
for ratification by the provincial legislatures.
   But the governments changed in three provinces _ Newfoundland,
Manitoba and New Brunswick _ and the new premiers have refused to
back the amendment.
   The Meech Lake accord would define Quebec as a ``distinct
society'' from the rest of Canada as a way to protect its French
language and culture.

   Residents dug through debris Sunday to find
belongings strewn by a series of tornadoes, including five pickup
trucks that were flung a quarter of a mile, officials said.
   The tornadoes destroyed three houses and severely damaged two
others late Saturday in this southwestern Oklahoma community,
police said. There were no reports of injuries.
   ``We found a little more debris today,'' Hinton police
dispatcher Brent Tucker said Sunday. ``My assistant chief said he
stood on a hill outside the city last night and saw what looked
like a half-mile path of total destruction.''
   There were reports of as many as three funnel clouds.
   The five pickup trucks were blown about a quarter-mile from
their parking spots during the storm, six cattle disappeared and
five horses were killed, Tucker said.
   ``There was a John Deere tractor with a disc (plow) on it that
was in the storm,'' Tucker said. ``They found the disc but are
still looking for the tractor.''
   Six families were left homeless, said Oklahoma County Red Cross
spokesman Franci Hart.
   Police dispatcher Mike Michaelis in Binger about 10 miles to the
south said a tornado touched down outside city limits and damaged a
house and barn.
   The National Weather Service said the twister was reported about
five miles west of Binger at 8:52 p.m., moving to the east. Another
twister was reported two miles east of the city.
   The nearby town of Gracemont was hit by baseball-sized hail that
knocked holes in the roof of the fire station, said city
firefighter Ray Watts. He said he was unaware of any reports of
other damage or injuries.

   Two barges broke loose from their moorings
Sunday, prompting police to close a bridge over the Monongahela
River to keep the runaway vessels from striking support piers.
   The barges, which authorities said were moored in Braddock at
the Rochez Brothers construction supply company, drifted five miles
down the river after breaking free at 2 p.m.
   Police in five riverside cities, including Pittsburgh, watched
as the barges spun downstream, rebounding off the shore at times.
   One of the barges beached on a sandbar above Homestead. The
other passed under the closed High Level Bridge in Homestead
without incident.
   The barge was still stuck on the sandbar late Sunday; the other
was rounded up by a towboat and taken back to the company,
officials said.
   A Coast Guard spokesman said the incident was under
investigation. The barges broke free during high-water conditions
on Pittsburgh's three major rivers.

   Strong thunderstorm winds ripped down a
stage at a festival Sunday, injuring 27 people, police said.
   Several thousand people at the Baton Rouge Fest for All were
watching a warm-up band and waiting for a performance by the
Temptations when the accident occurred around 5:30 p.m., said Sgt.
Carl Thompson.
   ``The stage was covered with a canopy and there were speaker
towers on either side,'' Thompson said. ``The wind came up and
collapsed the towers.''
   Two people were hospitalized with facial lacerations and broken
bones, said paramedic Mark Olson. Twenty-five others were treated
for minor injuries and released.
   ``None of the band members were hurt,'' Olson said. `It was
mostly the people in the front of the stage, hurt by the speakers
tumbling down.''
   The two people most seriously injured were removed from beneath
the collapsed stage, Olson said. He estimated the crowd at 5,000.
   The stage platform, which was made of scaffolding, was about two
stories high, Olson said. The speaker units, each about 5 feet
tall, were stacked on separate 7-foot-high scaffoldings on either
side of the stage.
   The annual music and arts festival is held for two weekends on
streets throughout the downtown area of Louisiana's capital city.
The stage which collapsed was located in the parking lot of the
Baton Rouge Centroplex, which is part of the city government
building complex.
   The Temptations show was to have been the festival finale.
Officials canceled the show.
   The storms wreaked havoc through much of the state Sunday
evening, knocking down trees and cutting power to thousands.
   Winds gusted to 47 mph in Baton Rouge and 78 mph in the New
Orleans area. There were several reports of tornadoes, but none of
the sightings was immediately confirmed.
   About 25,000 people in New Orleans were without electricity for
at least part of the evening, said Mike Sanders of New Orleans
Public Service Inc. Power outages were also reported in central
Louisiana.

<HEAD>Keystone Camera Accuses Kodak of Abandoning U.S. Camera Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Keystone Camera Corp. has charged that
industry giant Eastman Kodak Co. ``has abandoned'' the U.S. camera
industry by relying on imports of foreign-made cameras.
   Keystone is seeking higher tariffs on all imports of hand-held
35mm cameras, except single lens reflex models, and on fixed-focus
hand-held 110 cameras. Kodak opposes to the proposed hike in
tariffs.
   ``We have not, of course, abandoned the U.S. camera market. We
are still a domestic producer of cameras,'' said Paul Allen, a
spokesman at Kodak's Rochester, N.Y., headquarters.
   Allen said Keystone's accusations were ``flawed from a factual
viewpoint.'' He said Kodak would respond in papers to be filed with
the U.S. International Trade Commission next week.
   In March, Keystone asked the commission to restrict imports for
five years, saying a ``flood'' of imports threatens its competitive
ability.
   Keystone describes itself as the sole remaining American
manufacturer of conventional 35-millimeter and 110 cameras and has
said 500 jobs at its Clifton base are at stake if tariffs aren't
raised.
   Last week, Kodak said they opposed Keystone's petition because
``import restrictions would reduce the popularity of photography,
putting at risk thousands of jobs for people who work in all
elements of the photographic industry.''
   Keystone executive Steve Ehrlich said Friday that Kodak is ``a
non-player in the camera industry. Their last two efforts show
that, with the disc and the instant.'' Ehrlich acknowledged that
Keystone went to Kodak in January and offered to manufacture
domestically-made cameras to be marketed under the Kodak name.
   Ehrlich said the higher tariffs would lead to higher prices for
Kodak cameras while Keystone, with 1989 sales of $42 million, would
be able to reduce its prices because it could produce more cameras.
   Kodak, the world's largest photography company, said it had
sales of $18.4 billion in 1989.

<HEAD>U.S. Soviet Analysts Grow Pessimistic For Gorbachev</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet Reforms, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leading U.S. analysts have offered some of their
most pessimistic assessments yet of Mikhail Gorbachev's future in
the wake of an economic reform proposal most experts consider a
disaster.
   ``(Gorbachev's) destiny is linked to this price reform,'' said
Judy Shelton, a Stanford University economist who has written a
critical book about the Soviet economy.
   Calling the proposed tripling of basic food prices untenable,
Shelton predicted: ``I think the day the bread price hike takes
effect, he'll be out.''
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov announced plans last week
for a public referendum on an economic plan that would raise prices
of most products by next year, including a tripling of bread prices
by Jan. 1.
   U.S. experts predicted spreading strikes and devastating runs on
stores and hoarding in anticipation of price hikes.
   ``I would be prepared to say that this moves him one step
closer'' to falling from power, said Harvard University historian
Marshall Goldman.
   The proposed five-year plan is a compromise between the
decades-old centrally planned economy _ under which Moscow set
virtually all prices and wages _ and radical plans for a
Polish-style ``shock-therapy'' to shift to a market economy over
two years.
   Soviet lawmakers are divided about the cures for numerous
economic ills. Wages are soaring in the double digits while
industrial production has dropped significantly. The country has a
huge budget deficit, shortages are chronic and consumers wait in
long, demoralizing lines to buy the few goods available.
   Soviet officials describe the proposed new system as a regulated
market, because wage and price controls would be lifted gradually,
and not all state businesses would be sold.
   Although the plan would allow many Soviet enterprises and
properties to be bought and sold, as well as go bankrupt, Western
experts said it wasn't radical enough to solve the country's
festering problems.
   ``Getting halfway there may be worse than never even starting,''
said Ed Hewitt, a Soviet analyst at the Brookings Institute, a
Washington think tank.
   Soviet polls have indicated that about half of Soviet citizens
would support a free market system. But it was unclear whether they
would vote for skyrocking prices and unprecedented unemployment
based on promises of better times by a government that, by its own
admission, lacks solid popular support.
   ``He's lost credibility. His situation has deteriorated so
much,'' Goldman said in a telephone interview. ``The methods that
he should have used _ markets, family farming, joint ventures _
have gotten off to such a bad start.''
   Hewitt said he was less worried about Gorbachev's personal
position than about his ability to govern after the referendum, for
which no date has been set.
   ``The one mistake that we've made over the last few years is
that we've underestimated him,'' Hewitt said. ``But I'm sure that
the economic reform package will not work. If they don't pull it
back and do something more serious, they're going to do more damage
than from five years of wandering in the wilderness.''
   Shelton said the price hikes were intended to raise money to
eliminate the Soviet budget deficit, estimated at anywhere between
$40 billion and $165 billion.
   ``This is not a market plan. Their prices always have been
fixed. Now they will just be fixed at the market rate,'' she said.
   Shelton said Gorbachev was caught between the need to convert
quickly to a market system and a fear of popular unrest over high
unemployment and prices that would result. He chose a middle route
of retaining control of higher prices.
   Hewitt said the referendum decision reflected the government's
own lack of credibility.
   ``The government and whole leadership are acutely aware they are
not elected, so they decided to have elected policies,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tobacco Analysts Don't Expect Run On Stocks With Harvard's Sales</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ A move by two universities to divest
tobacco stocks shouldn't trigger a barrage of sell orders, analysts
say, but it hasn't helped the industry's image.
   ``It is only an egghead institution that would do it,'' John C.
Mazwell, an analyst at Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Richmond,
Va., said of the recent divestment decisions by Harvard University
and the City University of New York. ``It makes absolutely no
sense. This is a legal product,'' he said.
   Still, the divestiture could give momentum to the anti-smoking
movement and to efforts to restrict tobacco sales in the United
States, analysts say.
   On Thursday, Louis W. Sullivan, the secretary of health and
human services, called on state and local governments to curb
cigarette sales to minors by banning cigarette-vending machines.
   Maxwell said he doubted such a ban would have an impact on the
tobacco industry because machines account for only about three
percent of sales.
   But Calvert Crary, an analyst with Martin Simpson &amp; Co., said
the divestitures could change public thinking about the tobacco
industry.
   ``The companies' ability to exist has to do with the public's
and regulators' perception,'' he told the Winston-Salem Journal.
``As long as the public agrees that tobacco is OK, that's the
environment it needs to survive and thrive in.''
   Domestic tobacco sales have been declining gradually, Crary said.
   ``With a sudden shift in regulator and consumer perception on
the product and tightened regulatory restrictions, you could
accelerate that trend,'' he said.
   Harvard began selling its tobacco holdings last year. The City
University of New York announced recently that it would sell all of
its stock in companies that make tobacco products.
   Derek Bok, Harvard's president, wrote in a letter to students
May 18 that the university divested because of the health risks of
smoking and the aggressive marketing tactics by the industry to
sell cigarettes to teen-agers.
   Diana K. Temple, an analyst for Salomon Bros., said, ``I don't
see a wholesale movement right now away from tobacco.''
   She said religious and some other groups have refused to invest
in tobacco for years.
   Most investors, she said, were more concerned about the
potential impact of a batch of lawsuits against tobacco companies
in recent years that have tried to hold the companies liable for
smokers who have died of lung cancer.
   Most institutional investors, said Emanuel Goldman of Paine
Webber, are more interested in improving the value of investments
than with the morality of a company.
   ``My point is the objective of money managers is to maximize
their return, and if you leave out the tobacco stock, you'll be
limiting yourself,'' he said.
