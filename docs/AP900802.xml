   A fire at a downtown hotel Thursday
killed one person and injured five others.
   ``The fire broke out on the sixth floor of the Harrison Hotel
and spread to a portion of the seventh,'' said fire Battalion Chief
John McPartland.
   The fire was reported at 6:28 p.m., and was brought under
control in a little over half an hour by 65 firefighters,
McPartland said.
   The identity of the person who died was not released.
   One firefighter suffered chest pains and was taken to a hospital
as a precaution, McPartland said. Four occupants of the hotel
suffered smoke inhalation.
   McPartland estimated damage to the seven-story structure at
$250,000.

<HEAD>Report: Internal Inquiry Found Misconduct By Ritter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigation ordered by Covenant House's
board of directors determined the organization's founder, the Rev.
Bruce Ritter, engaged in sexual misconduct with young men at
shelters for runaways, says a published report.
   The article in Friday's New York Times cited unidentified people
who had read the investigative report. The report is to be released
Friday, the newspaper said.
   The report describes sexual activity that some Covenant House
resident said they engaged in with Ritter, the Times said.
   Investigators interviewed one person who told of seeing the
priest lying in bed with a young man, the newspaper quoted two
sources as saying.
   Investigators also talked to other Covenant House residents who
said Ritter made sexual overtures toward them that were spurned,
the Times said.
   The four-month investigation was headed by Robert J. McGuire, a
former city police commissioner.
   Ritter, 63, has vehemently denied the allegations, has declined
to be interviewed for months and is said to have refused to
cooperate with McGuire's investigation. The former head of Covenant
House is believed to be living in New Jersey and considering
leaving the Franciscan order.
   The McGuire report is said to have found no evidence that Ritter
misappropriated funds.
   But the Times said the report blamed Covenant House's board of
directors for failing to oversee Ritter. The board did not even
know Ritter was receiving an annual salary of $98,000, the bulk of
which was going into a secret personal fund, the Times said.
   The fund, called the Franciscan Charitable Trust, had
accumulated nearly $1 million. Plans now call for it to be
liquidated and for the assets to go to Covenant House, as Ritter
says he intended all along.
   Had Ritter not resigned last February, the board would have had
to dismiss him, the Times said.
   Allegations against Ritter surfaced last December when Kevin Lee
Kite, 26, a drifter from Texas, accused the priest of luring him
into a sexual relationship. Kite's accusations were followed by
similar allegations by two others, including Darryl Bassile, 31, a
social worker from Ithaca, N.Y.
   McGruire's investigation concluded that Bassile was the most
credible of Ritter's public accusers.
   Since spring, more than half the 17 Covenant House board members
have resigned. Donations have fallen and cutbacks have been made.
   Sister Mary Rose McGeady, senior Catholic Charities official in
the borough of Queens, is to replace Ritter as head of the shelter
on Sept. 1.
   Ritter founded Covenant House in 1968. Today the shelter serves
28,000 youths in 15 U.S. cities, Canada and Central America each
year.
   The Manhattan district attorney concluded an investigation into
Ritter's finances without bringing charges against him. The state
attorney general's office has not yet concluded a similar probe.

<HEAD>NTSB Reports 10 `Close Calls' in Three Years for NASA Training
Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The supersonic jets used by NASA to train
space shuttle pilots were involved in ``close calls'' with other
aircraft at least 10 times since 1986, according to a federal
report released Wednesday.
   The incidents occurred in the three years period before a near
collision in May 1989 between a T-38 training airplane piloted by
astronaut David Walker and a Pan Am airbus carrying 166 passengers,
according to the report by the National Transportation Safety
Board. The report was carried in Thursday's editions of The Orlando
Sentinel.
   Last month, the space agency grounded Walker, a Navy captain and
a native of Eustis, Fla., for 60 days, citing ``various
infractions'' while he was flying the training planes.
   The NTSB report included details of Walker's near-collision and
brief mentions of the other 10 incidents. NASA officials said they
couldn't comment on the report because they had yet to see it.
   The report doesn't offer specifics on the incidents, other than
to say they happened between April 1986 and April 1989. Air safety
investigators said the close calls were included among 22
``operational hazard'' and ``hazardous air traffic'' reports they
obtained from NASA, all involving the T-38s.
   ``Ten of the reports dealt with `close calls' with another
aircraft,'' the NTSB stated. NASA defines a close call as any
incident involving the planes ``which possesses a high potential
for a mishap.''
   Jeff Carr, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
said no one there had any information about the NASA reports cited
by air safety investigators.
   The T-38 trainers, based at the Houston center, are flown mostly
by space shuttle pilots preparing for missions, but they are also
used by about 15 civilian instructor pilots, Carr said.
   On May 15, 1989, Walker flew one of the T-38s from Houston to
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington for a meeting with President
Bush. In making his approach, he descended to 7,000 feet _ 1,000
feet lower than he had been cleared _ and passed 700 feet in front
of the airbus.
   Walker and another shuttle pilot, Navy Cmdr. Robert ``Hoot''
Gibson, were both grounded by NASA on July 9. Gibson's suspension
was for his involvement in a mid-air collision at a Texas airshow
that left the other pilot dead.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Coup leader Abu Bakr and 112
militant Moslem followers surrendered Wednesday and freed 46
hostages they seized five days earlier in a failed bid to overthrow
the government, officials said.
   State radio said a wounded hostage freed on Saturday died on
Wednesday in a hospital. That raised the death toll in the uprising
to at least 10.
   Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran said the rebels, who
appeared not to have any significant support among the people,
``surrendered unconditionally'' and were under heavy guard at an
army base.
   He said they would face ``the appropriate charges,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Dookeran told reporters that Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson
had not resigned, as he had offered to while held hostage.
   ``Prime Minister Robinson is the prime minister of Trinidad and
Tobago,'' Dookeran said. ``There is no intention to resign.''
   ``We have made no deals with this extremist group,'' said
Dookeran, who was held hostage on the first day of the coup attempt.
   Bakr released Dookeran on Saturday, saying he wanted the deputy
prime minister to head a caretaker government that would hold new
elections in the Caribbean nation.
   The attempted coup began Friday when armed rebels stormed the
state television station and the Parliament building, taking top
government officials and other captives.
   Bakr had demanded the resignation of Robinson, whom he accused
of corruption.
   The 63-year-old prime minister was freed Tuesday and
hospitalized for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the takeover
as well as exhaustion and glaucoma.
   Bakr blamed Robinson for widespread poverty in this former
British colony of 1.3 million people. Bakr was among the rebels who
surrendered at the television station, where the first group of
hostages was freed.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw said 113 rebels, including
Bakr, took part in the coup. He said 46 hostages held at Parliament
and the TV building one mile away were released Wednesday.
   Shaw and army spokesman Maj. Dave Williams said all hostages and
rebels had been evacuated and taken to separate army bases.
   State radio identified the former hostage who died Wednesdey as
Leo des Vignes, a junior minister. It said he died of a heart
attack in the hospital after being shot in the heel during the
takeover.
   The rebels released him on Saturday, the broadcast said.
   The radio said heavy gunfire was reported Wednesday evening in
Champs Fleurs, about 10 miles east of Port-of-Spain. There was no
official explanation, but soldiers have been firing blank bullets
to scatter would-be looters for several days.
   The 29 captives at the TV station were all station employees.
The remaining 17 hostages at the Parliament building included seven
Cabinet ministers.
   In a live broadcast, state radio described the haggard-looking
captives filing out of the television station, one by one.
   Soldiers searched each one in the street, because the militants
had claimed at one point to have wired the captives with explosives
and threatened to blow them up.
   After the prisoner release, witnesses said about 50 rebels left
the television building, dropped their weapons and surrendered to
soldiers.
   Witnesses said Bakr emerged wearing a fez, a white tunic and
white trousers. Like the other rebels, he dropped his gun and put
his hands behind his head.
   After boarding an army bus, Bakr shouted: ``Allahu akhbar!'' or
God is great.
   Hostages began leaving the Parliament building at 5:10 p.m. EDT.
The first to leave was a woman who held a white handkerchief to her
face.
   An army truck rolled up to the red, colonial-style building to
provide cover for soldiers who escorted her down the street.
   A few minutes later, the finance minister, Selby Wilson,
emerged, followed by another man who had a white handkerchief tied
across his face. The two men walked unescorted to a security van.
   The hostages walked along a sidewalk to a security area at the
end of the street, where they emptied their pockets and were
searched before getting onto an army bus. Some of the hostages
jogged down the street; others walked.
   Justice Minister Selwyn Richardson, reportedly shot in the leg
during the Parliament takeover, walked with a noticeable limp.
Applause broke out as he boarded the bus.
   State radio said the rebels were taken to army headquarters at
Chaguerames in northwest Trinidad and the freed hostages to Camp
Ogden, an army base about five miles west of Port-of-Spain.
   A local reporter who spoke with the former hostages at Camp
Ogden said they told him they had not eaten since Friday but were
otherwise OK. They were all undergoing medical exams in a tent.
   At Ogden Camp, freed hostage Grensell Kissoon, told a reporter,
``I'm glad to be alive.''
   TV station worker Raul Board held onto a post, saying he feared
he might faint from hunger. ``You know why I'm holding the post?
I'm afraid I might fall.''
   The capital was quiet Wednesday. A 6 p.m.-to-noon curfew
remained in effect throughout most of Trinidad following earlier
widespread looting.
   Bakr's Jamaat al-Muslimeen group, which means the Moslem Group
in Arabic, was founded in 1984 and is believed to have 250 to 300
members. It is also believed to have received financing from Libya.
   Gargano had said 200 troops from neighboring Caribbean nations
were on neighboring Barbados and ``could be here in 45 minutes,''
but that Trinidad and its sister island of Tobago had not asked for
help.

<TEXT>
   With decolonization complete,
African leaders are turning to conflicts within their own countries
that have killed millions of people, maimed countless more and
created 5 million refugees.
   Those internal wars, some decades old, have been largely ignored
by the Organization of African Unity, which devoted itself to
supporting guerrilla movements in South Africa and colonies ruled
by Europeans.
   Civil wars were considered beyond the bounds of the OAU, whose
charter forbade meddling in the internal affairs of member states.
   Last month, a change began. For the first time since its birth
in 1963, the organization declared that ballots should determine
the future of the continent's 550 million people, not force of
arms. It did not change the charter, but clearly shifted emphasis.
   ``The issue of restoring peace and stability to African
countries and of dismantling the apartheid system was the dominant
theme of discussion during the 26th OAU summit,'' the
English-language daily Ethiopian Herald said in an editorial. The
paper is published in Addis Ababa, headquarters of the OAU.
   In African eyes, the continent became free of colonies when
Namibia gained independence from South Africa in March. Africans
viewed Namibia, which South Africa governmed under a U.N. mandate
withdrawn in 1966, as a colony of the white-ruled country.
   The OAU and United Nations have long recognized South Africa as
an independent nation, but have tried to end the apartheid racial
policy that maintains supremacy for 5 million whites over 28
million blacks.
   In previous years, the OAU has committed itself to financing
guerrilla armies in areas ranging from Cape Verde, when it was a
Portuguese colony, to the British territory of Rhodesia, now
black-ruled Zimbabwe.
   It ended the June summit with the usual condemnation of
apartheid, but for the first time omitted mention of continuing to
support guerrilla-backed movements like the African National
Congress or Pan-Africanist Congress.
   Instead, Africa's leaders committed themselves to increasing
democracy within their own countries and finding peaceful solutions
to civil wars in progress from the Western Sahara in the far
northwest to Mozambique in the southeast.
   Here is a look at the long-running wars:
   ANGOLA _ Portugal, the colonial power, pulled out of this
agriculturally rich West African territory in 1975, leaving three
anti-colonial guerrilla armies to fight for the spoils. The Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola won. Since then, the Marxist
government has battled Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, which has U.S. support. Zaire is mediating
peace talks.
   CHAD _ This landlocked desert nation in north central Africa,
independent from France since 1960, has been torn by rebellions and
three civil wars. Virtually all involved meddling and military
incursions by Chad's northern neighbor, Libya, with which it has a
border dispute. President Hissen Habre's army scored a major
victory over the Libyans in 1987, but skirmishing continues between
government forces and Libyan-backed rebels.
   ETHIOPIA _ For 29 years, Africa's longest civil war has raged in
northernmost Eritrea Province, where rebels of the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front control virtually all the countryside and
the port of Massawa, one of Ethiopia's two Red Sea harbors. The
Eritreans, loosely allied with the Tigre People's Liberation Front
in neighboring Tigre province, want independence for Eritrea, a
former Italian colony federated with Ethiopia in 1952. The Tigreans
want to overthrow the central government of President Mengistu
Haile Mariam. The two conflicts and the famines they spawned have
claimed more than 1 million lives.
   MOZAMBIQUE _ After Portugal granted independence in 1975, a
rebel army called the Mozambique National Resistance, known as
Renamo, was organized within Mozambique by the white military of
neighboring Rhodesia. Mozambique was the main springboard for
incursions by guerrillas bent on toppling Rhodesia's white-minority
government. White-ruled South Africa took over Renamo after
Rhodesia became Zimbabwe in 1980, but now says it has ended support
of the guerrillas. Hundreds of thousands of people have died and
other hundreds of thousands have fled Mozambique. Preliminary peace
talks began last year, but no real progress is evident.
   SOMALIA _ Since 1969, when he took power in a military coup,
President Mohammed Siad Barre has ruled this Horn of Africa nation
with what human rights groups describe as nearly unmatched
brutality. Insurgents in the north have fought his regime for a
decade and new rebel organizations sprang up in the south last
year. The president has promised a referendum on a new constitution
later this year and multiparty elections early in 1991.
   SUDAN _ For seven years, southern rebels who are mainly
Christian or animist have been fighting for autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated central government in Khartoum. Former President
Jimmy Carter arranged peace talks last year that failed to settle
the conflict. As in Ethiopia, the fighting has led to periodic
famine and the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.
   WESTERN SAHARA _ Morocco and the Polisario Front, a Marxist
group, have been at war since 1977 over the desolate Western
Sahara. Spain as the colonial power, granted the region to Morocco
and Mauritania in 1975, but Mauritania later abandoned its claim.
The Morocco-Polisario conflict has been largely at stalemate in
recent years.

<TEXT>
   West Germans are getting out
their calculators and pondering whether they will be economic
victors or victims as foreign troops begin leaving over the next
few years.
   West Germany sees its mighty economic machine growing even
stronger when land now occupied by foreign forces is made available
for German development for the first time in four decades.
   But many Germans have become hooked on cash-carrying Cold
Warriors, and they are clearly concerned.
   ``If all the Americans leave, it's going to hurt each and every
German. Americans spend enormous amounts of money here,'' said
Harry Spittler, who owns a gift shop in Kaiserslautern.
   American officials say West Germany gets an annual infusion of
about $8.75 billion because of the U.S. troop presence alone. About
200,000 Germans earn their livings directly from the American
deployment.
   If all goes well at conventional weapons talks in Vienna, the
United States and Soviet Union will each lower their troop levels
in central Europe to 195,000 apiece.
   Under that plan, about 59,000 U.S. troops will leave West
Germany over the next five years. There are currently 250,000
American soldiers here, a figure that does not include dependents.
   Britain has said it also plans to reduce its troop levels in
West Germany by the mid-1990s, halving the current number of about
66,700.
   The Kaiserslautern area _ with about 70,000 American troops and
their dependents plus civilian workers _ has the greatest
concentration of U.S. troops outside the continental United States.
   Some of the largest U.S. military installations in Europe are in
Kaiserslautern, including Ramstein Air Base, European headquarters
for the U.S. Air Force.
   Spittler, 64, is a classic example of how some West Germans hav
developed an economic addiction to the foreign troops.
   His clientele at Harry's Gift Shop is almost exclusively
American. They are drawn by his huge stock of beer steins,
nutcracker dolls and cuckoo clocks _ German souvenirs that are
especially coveted by GIs scouting gifts to send to their families
stateside.
   The store clerks and Spittler speak fluent English. Instead of
hearing ``Guten Morgen,'' customers are greeted with a cheery
``Good morning!''
   If that doesn't make an American GI feel at home, there's always
the selection of American music coming from the shop's stereo
system. ``On Top of Old Smokey'' was playing one recent day.
   No one expects the U.S. military to pull completely out of West
Germany in the near future.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said repeatedly West Germany must
continue to house American troops because there is always the
chance a military threat to Europe could arise again.
   But even the most optimistic government officials concede that
whatever troop cutbacks are in store, weaning West Germans from
four decades of military-supplied economic nourishment will not be
easy.
   ``American soldiers have their apartments here and they spend a
lot of money shopping and in restaurants. When disarmament comes,
naturally jobs will be lost as well as some economic power,'' said
Juergen Dietzen, spokesman for the Interior Ministry of
Rhineland-Palatinate state.
   Rhineland-Palatinate is home to 64,000 American troops. More
than 40,000 state residents earn their livings either directly or
indirectly from the American military presence, Dietzen said.
   The state is already making plans for what to do after the
closure of a major U.S. air base at Zweibruecken. The base is to be
shut in 1993, and there is concern for the more than 340 German
nationals working there.
   But the closing also demonstrates how West German officials seem
to have optimistic views of life after the soldiers leave.
   Rhineland-Palatinate is charting plans to develop the base site
into an industrial park with a commercial airport, providing jobs
for thousands of civilians.
   ``We try not to get caught up in the problems that lie before
us,'' Dietzen said. ``We like to think of the new possibilities.''
   Some West German communities are even trying to get the U.S.
government to include them as Washington decides where to make its
troop cuts.
   Frankfurt, for example, has been eyeing military sites nearby as
possible places for economic expansion.

<HEAD>Groups Sue to Block Shipment of Chemical Arms to Pacific</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three groups filed suit Wednesday to block the
Army's plan to ship chemical weapons from West Germany to Johnston
Atoll, saying the muntions pose a threat to the environment and
people of the Pacific.
   Meanwhile, leaders of the 15-nation South Pacific Forum, meeting
in Port Vila, Vanuatu, issued a communique saying U.S. plans to
incinerate chemical weapons at Johnston Atoll could turn the
Pacific into ``the toxic waste disposal center of the world.''
   The communique called for closing the disposal plant once its
current operations are completed.
   Greenpeace, the Institute for the Advancement of Hawaiian
Affairs and the World Council of Indigenous Peoples-Hawaii contend
the Army hasn't adequately considered the risks involved in
shipping the American-owned weapons across the ocean and
incinerating them at the atoll 800 miles southwest of here.
   ``We emphatically support the destruction of these weapons, but
not at the expense of the Pacific environment,'' said David
Chatfield, chairman of Greenpeace USA.
   The groups, represented by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund,
said incineration of chemical weapons is an unproven procedure.
They said the government hasn't adequately considered other means
of disposal, including chemical neutralization.
   They are seeking an injunction from the U.S. District Court here
to block further movement of the munitions.
   Some 100,000 rounds of nerve gas projectiles are to be shipped
to Johnston Atoll during the next few months. The Army plans to
store them at the facility and destroy them in an incinerator that
is still being tested.
   The suit names Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Michael P.
Stone, secretary of the Army, as defendants.
   ``The Army's action is also illegal because the Army has done an
extremely shoddy job of assessing the environmental impact of this
scheme,'' said Skip Spaulding, a staff attorney for the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund. ``Indeed, it appears that this shipment is
merely a political gimmick to get (West German Chancellor Helmut)
Kohl re-elected at the expense of U.S. environmental laws.''
   The weapons from West Germany would add 100,000 rounds to the
300,000 rounds of nerve and mustard gas stored at Johnston Atoll
since 1971.
   They will be put in storage on Johnston Atoll until the Army
finishes testing an incinerator for the munitions. The tests are to
be completed late next year, and full-scale destruction is not
expected to begin until 1992.
   The Army has said moving the weapons and destroying them at
Johnston Atoll would have minimal public health, safety and
environmental effects.
   At the meeting of the South Pacific forum, Prime Minister Bob
Hawke of Australia argued in favor of the plan, saying scientific
evidence indicated the incineration was safe. He said the project
was in the interests of worldwide disarmament.
   The Pacific leaders, whose governments represent about 25
million people, will discuss the issue Friday with a U.S.
delegation.

   Christopher F. Edley, who as president of the
United Negro College Fund helped raise $556 million dollars over 18
years, announced Wednesday that he will retire at the end of the
year.
   Edley, 62, who had a heart bypass operation seven years ago, is
retiring because of health problems, the organization announced.
   Under Edley's leadership, the fund adopted its now-famous
advertising slogan, ``A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste,'' and
became one of the best known charities in the nation.
   The fund raised $10 million the year before Edley became
president. Last year, it took in more than $50 million.
   The fund also runs a capital campaign with a goal of raising
$250 million, mainly for building projects. Money from the fund
helps pay operating expenses at 41 institutions that enroll 48,233
students.
   Edley earned a law degree at Harvard University after graduating
from Howard University in 1949. He was an assistant district
attorney in Philadelphia before becoming an officer at the Ford
Foundation.

   During his first week in office President
Alberto Fujimori has quickly shaken up top government echelons, and
popular opinion seems to support his drive to stabilize the
battered nation.
   Just hours after taking office on Saturday, Fujimori strolled
into the Presidential Palace for a ritual hand-shaking ceremony
with the commanders of the army, navy and air force.
   When the names of the military chiefs were called, Peruvians
were startled to learn that the heads of the navy and the air force
weren't the same officers who had been in power at lunchtime.
   Asked at his first news conference on Sunday why he had removed
Adm. Alfonso Panizo and Air Gen. German Vucetich, Fujimori replied,
``The laws give this right to the president.''
   Insiders said the president acted because the navy was rumored
to have been fomenting a coup attempt and the air force general had
been linked to corruption in the military.
   Fujimori later fired the nation's four top police officials, and
his government called it a ``staff renovation.'' But rumored
corruption in law enforcement agencies was the likely reason.
   The 52-year-old president, a mild-looking agronomist of Japanese
ancestry, won an upset victory in June for a five-year term as
president of Peru's 22 million citizens.
   He promised fairness in government and honesty in leadership,
but no one expected him to act so decisively so quickly. So far,
the public's reaction has been mostly positive.
   ``Fuji Does Not Tremble.'' the newspaper Novedades proclaimed in
a front-page headline.
   To prepare measures for combating ruinous inflation, the
president declared a two-day bank holiday. He promised Peruvians he
would not touch individual savings accounts, as happened earlier in
the year in neighboring Brazil. Fujimori said people shouldn't
panic, and they didn't.
   Caretas, Peru's largest weekly news magazine, called Fujimori a
``house on fire'' and said he appeared to be ``shaking things up by
going after everybody.''
   El Comercio of Lima, Peru's biggest newspaper, reported that a
vast majority of people questioned after his inauguration gave
Fujimori a ``good'' rating.
   ``The most important thing is the morality part,'' said Javier
Juaman, a Lima store clerk. He was referring to Fujimori's
inaugural pledge to crack down on government corruption and make
bureaucrats more sensitive to the problems of Peru's so-called
``ordinary people.''
   Fujimori called Peru's legal system unfair to the masses of poor
people and said the Justice Palace is better known on the street as
``the Injustice Palace.''
   One of Fujimori's biggest challenges is the leftist Shining Path
insurgency, which has wreaked havoc in Peru for years and defied
military efforts to stifle it. The president says the best way to
defeat the rebels is by raising Peruvians' living standards and
promoting economic development.
   On Tuesday, Fujimori took a walk for several blocks in downtown
Lima. Onlookers cheered, and children shrieked, ``Foo-hee,
Foo-hee'' _ which is how the first half of the president's name is
pronounced in Spanish.
   It was too early to tell how Fujimori's street popularity would
affect his ability to work with Peru's many political parties.
   His grassroots coalition, Change 90, suffered serious defections
before the inauguration and no one from the coalition wound up in
Fujimori's Cabinet. The coalition is in the minority in both houses
of Peru's Congress.
   ``He appears to be truthful, but he's also being very generic,''
said Sen. Miguel Cruchaga Belaunde of the Democratic Front
coalition. That group's presidential candidate, famed novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa, lost to Fujimori in the most stunning upset in
modern Latin American politics.
   Fujimori had scored under 1 percent in opinion surveys at the
beginning of the year, but he swept to the front during the spring
presidential campaign when voters became alienated by Vargas
Llosa's vow to introduce tough austerity measures to revitalize the
economy.
   The novelist was also tainted by the support he received from
traditionally discredited political parties.
   Running on a platform emphasizing ``consensus,'' Fujimori took a
centrist position in his campaign and managed to draw supporters
from across party lines with his populist image.
   Legislators from many parties whooped and cheered during
Fujimori's inaugural address in the House of Representatives.
   Minutes earlier, the same lawmakers had booed and banged on
their desks when the outgoing president, Alan Garcia, tried to make
a farewell speech.

   Here is a comparison of the military forces of Iraq and Kuwait:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The numbers of Iraqi servicemen and weapons dwarf those of
Kuwait.
   Iraq has been engaged in a major defense buildup since President
Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979. Its combined military forces
are estimated at 1 million, with roughly half as active reservists.
   The army encompasses five armored, two mechanized and 39
infantry divisions with 20 special forces brigades. Equipment
includes 4,500 Soviet and 1,500 Chinese tanks, according to figures
from the 1989-90 Statesman's Yearbook.
   The air force has about 500 combat aircraft. The planes are in
large part Soviet-designed, including 30 Su-7 and 50 Su-20
fighter-bombings. There are an unknown number of MiG-29s and 90
MiG-23 interceptors and fighter-bombers.
   Military service of up to two years is compulsory for all men at
18 years of age.
   On Tuesday, as Iraqi and Kuwaiti envoys met to discuss their
border and oil dispute, diplomats said Iraq had massed 100,000
troops on Kuwait's border. That was more than triple the number
estimated earlier.
   The reported Iraqi troop buildup included hundreds of tanks and
armored personnel carriers.

   Kuwait has a total of about 20,300 troops in its military.
   It maintains a small but well-equipped army with two armored
divisions, a mechanized infantry brigade and a surface-to-surface
missile battalion.
   Its air force, initially a small combat force, has grown to
include two squadrons with 25 Mirage F1-C fighters and two
squadrons with 30 Skyhawk attack aircraft.
   For most Kuwaitis, military service is compulsory for 24 months.

   Two men have been executed in the southern city
of Fuzhou for murdering a retired party official, a radio report
said.
   The death sentences were among hundreds handed down so far this
year as China goes through one of its periodic anti-crime
campaigns. The campaigns have not halted a rising crime rate.
   Wednesday's report by the Fujian Provincial radio service said
Chen Shangzhi and Fu Rongwen were convicted of murder at a public
rally July 23 in which 186 criminals were tried and sentenced for
commiting 101 serious crimes, including murder, robbery and theft.
   Chen and Fu were executed immediately after the rally, it said.
   In China, executions are usually carried out with a single
bullet to the back of the head.

spitting or littering and about half of them were fined, officials
said today.
   Wednesday was the first day of an indefinite police crackdown on

   Iraq pulled out of talks Wednesday
on a 2-week-old border, oil and money dispute with Kuwait shortly
before it reportedly sent its forces to invade the oil-rich
neighbor.
   Kuwaitis tried to fend off the Iraqis with heavy artillery, said
Kuwait government officials contacted by telephone from Bahrain
said. Iraq had no immediate comment.
   Earlier in the day, Kuwait, faced with the buildup of an
estimated 100,000 Iraq troops at its border, had tried to give a
new impetus to talks. Kuwaiti officials had offered to move
negotiations to either of their capitals.
   Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's Revolutionary Command
Council, left the Saudi summer capital early Wednesday without
holding a scheduled second round of talks with Kuwait's Crown
Prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah. He gave
no explanation for his abrupt departure.
   In Baghdad, deputy prime minister Sa'doun Hammadi said the two
sides failed to reach an agreement because Iraq ``did not see any
seriousness by Kuwaiti officials in tackling the major damage
inflicted on Iraq due to their recent behavior and stands against
Iraq's fundamental interests.''
   Hammadi had told the official Iraqi News Agency that the talks
would continue as agreed with mediators, President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   Ibrahim's sudden departure tensed nerves in the oil-rich Gulf
region even before the evasion was reported by Kuwait. Oil
executives said the price of oil shot up by 50 cents a barrel.
   Fahd had arranged for Sheik Saad and Ibrahim to hug and embrace
after their arrival in the Saudi summer capital on Tuesday, and
feted both delegations at a dinner banquet.
   Crown Prince Abdullah brought the two sides together for two
hours of talks, including a tete-a-tete between the delegation
leaders.
   Sources close to the conference said Iraq maintained a hard-line
stance. Baghdad insisted the Jiddah session be a protocol meeting
to be followed by a working meeting in Baghdad.
   The Kuwaiti delegation held extensive talks with the Saudi
leadership after the departure of the Iraqis. Before his own
departure, Sheik Saad issued a statement affirming his country's
faith in continuing the dialogue.
   Also indicating Kuwaiti acquiescence to Iraq's demand for moving
the talks to Baghdad, Sheik Saad said: ``I look forward to
continuing the meetings and continuing the negotiations in each of
the two sister countries to reach a solution to all issues.''
   Conference sources had said the Saudi monarch would try to
arrange a summit between Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and
Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah to break the deadlock.
   Saddam began the dispute on July 17 by accusing Kuwait of
costing Iraq $14 billion by pumping more oil than the quota
assigned to it by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   He said Kuwait stole $2.4 billion in oil from a field along
their disputed border and demanded Kuwait write off billions in
loans left over from the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   Iraq's complaints about the oil glut had seemed appeased by
Kuwait's firm pledge to respect the new OPEC production agreement
reached last week in Geneva.
   Kuwait responded to the Iraqi threats by airing its own
grievances against Iraq for failing to agree to the demarcation of
post-colonial borders. But the country apparently was induced by
the Arab mediators to ignore the troop buildup and opt for
negotiations.
   Until the past few days, the Iraqi government media had waged a
vitriolic propaganda campaign against Kuwait. Charges included that
Kuwait was a stooge of the United States and that the leadership
was attempting to destroy Iraq's oil and economic development.

<HEAD>Government Announces S&amp;L `Clearance Sale'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal savings and loan bailout agency
wants America to know it's ready to deal.
   Under mounting political pressure to speed the pace of the
thrift cleanup, the Resolution Trust Corp. announced a ``clearance
sale'' Wednesday, aimed at unloading $50 billion in assets from
failed S&amp;Ls.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the agency, called it an
ambitious goal that, if met, would ``move the process along in a
really expeditious way.''
   But Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House Banking task
force on the bailout, said he wasn't impressed by the sales push,
given the huge task ahead.
   ``If you set low expectations, maybe you'll achieve them,''
Vento said. ``It seems to me they're drowning in the job.''
   However, Seidman said, ``The RTC operation is a complicated and
difficult job. It has taken us a little time to get organized. We
are organized now and we are under way.''
   In another S&amp;L development, the General Accounting Office,
Congress' auditing and investigative agency, told the Senate
Banking Committee that it sees ``strong indications'' the Justice
Department is gearing up to go after S&amp;L criminals. However, it
said it is too early to determine if the effort will be enough.
   The GAO said the Justice Department needs to devise a better
system to allow top officials in Washington to track the progress
of the fraud fight in regional U.S. attorney and FBI offices.
   What Seidman dubbed ``the great fall inventory clearance sale''
marks the second phase of his agency's cleanup effort. In the first
phase, called ``Operation Clean Sweep,'' the RTC concentrated on
selling the failed institutions and their deposits.
   But it ended up keeping a large share of the failed thrifts'
sour loans, problem real estate, junk bonds and other assets. Vento
and other Democrats in Congress had complained that selling
institution franchises represented scant progress unless
accompanied by substantial asset sales.
   Phase 2 is aimed at whittling the RTC's inventory. Sales
proceeds will offset what the agency has spent to pay off
depositors or to entice private investors into taking over
insolvent institutions.
   ``The bottom line is the better job we do, the less the taxpayer
has to pay,'' Seidman said.
   Among the sales techniques employed will be an international
satellite auction of 71 major properties, ``bulk sales'' of
packages of similar properties and the use of 15 special sales
offices stretching from King of Prussia, Pa., to Costa Mesa, Calif.
   The satellite auction is scheduled for Nov. 15 in Dallas.
Bidders in nine other U.S. cities and London and Tokyo will be able
to participate via satellite television hookup. The other U.S.
cities are Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New
Orleans, New York, Phoenix and San Antonio, Texas.
   Seventy-one properties, valued at $300 million, will be offered:
38 in Texas, 12 in Florida, eight in Colorado, six in Arizona, four
in California, two in Louisiana and one in Illinois.
   They range from Kings Crossing Golf Course &amp; Club in Corpus
Christi, Texas, to the opulent Western Savings Corporate Center in
Phoenix.
   Two bulk sales _ one of hotel properties in the East, another of
apartments in Florida _ will be ready to go by the end of August.
   In all, the RTC plans by Dec. 31 to sell $13.7 billion in assets
left over from previous S&amp;L sales: $6.7 billion in single-family
mortgages, $3.3 billion in securities, $1.6 billion in real estate
and $2.1 billion in other assets.
   It plans to get rid of an additional $36 billion in assets
either by selling them directly from failed but still-operating
thrifts in its control or by selling the assets when it sells the
institutions.
   Also, an estimated $30 billion in assets will be put under the
management of 200 to 300 private contractors.
   The RTC by June 30 had seized 454 failed thrifts, ``resolving''
207 of them. It plans to resolve an additional 130 by the end of
the year _ 77 in the July-September quarter and 53 in the
October-December period _ leaving it with 117 institutions.
   However, Seidman cautioned that the cleanup would not be even
half finished. Officials expect at least 250 more failures and
possibly as many as 450.
   Seidman warned, as he has previously, that the RTC's plans
depend on Congress providing new money for the bailout in September.

   Here are some facts and figures on Kuwait:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND _ Kuwait, which has 6,880 square miles, is bordered by Iraq
to the north and west, Saudi Arabia to the south-southwest, and the
Persian Gulf to the east. The oil-rich country is flat and very
dry. The nation gets an average of 5 inches of rain a year.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEOPLE _ About one-quarter of Kuwait's 1.7 million residents
live in the capital of Kuwait city and its suburbs. More than half
are foreigners, mainly Arab, including 300,000 Palestinians. Most
Kuwaitis are Sunni Moslem, but 30 percent adhere to the rival
Shiite sect. Shiites of Iranian descent number nearly 150,000. The
al-Sabah clan has ruled Kuwait as an emirate since they settled
there in 1756 after trekking from the Arabian hinterland. More than
70 percent of the people speak Arabic, the official language, while
10 percent speak Kurdish and 4 percent Iranian (Farsi). A
constitutional monarchy rules the country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Oil is the chief resource of Kuwait, a member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Only 1 percent of
the land is cultivated. Per capita income in 1986 was $13,890. Oil
revenue reached $30 billion in 1983, but has been declining since
because of a drop in oil, prices and production curbs. Kuwait
currently produces about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day and has
reserves of 89.7 billion barrels, 12.8 percent of world reserves
and enough to last for more than 250 years. Little grows in the
desert climate, so the emirate has to import nearly all its food.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ The Mongols, Arab caliphs and Ottomans were in turn
overlords of the bleak and largely unpopulated land until 1899,
when the British became the dominant power in the region. Kuwait
gained its independence in 1961. It is a member of the six-nation
Gulf Cooperation Council, a defense and economic alliance.

<HEAD>Research Suggests Gene Can Lead to Early Cancer for Smokers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Smokers carrying a still-unidentified gene are
more likely to develop lung cancer at an early age, according to a
study that traced smoking and lung cancer histories in 337
Louisiana families.
   The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute on Wednesday, said there was a clear genetic component to
the early onset of lung cancer among smokers. However, it said the
gene plays a lesser role in cancer among smokers late in life.
   ``If you smoke long enough, it'll get to you eventually,
regardless of what genes you are carrying,'' said Thomas A.
Sellers, a University of Minnesota scientist who was the lead
researcher in the study. ``The genetic component influences the age
of onset of the disease.''
   He said that statistically, about 27 percent of the smoking
population will get lung cancer over a lifetime.
   But in Sellers' study of lung cancer and smoking in the
Louisiana families there was a clear indication that some were more
likely to get lung cancer at an early age. The pattern, he said,
was suggestive of an inherited gene that leads to an earlier onset
of the disease.
   The study involved white families of about the same economic
status, Sellers said. The study gathered data through interviews of
family members and took into account the amount of smoking of those
with lung cancer.
   Sellers said the statistical model derived from the study shows
that the influence of both smoking and the gene would result in
70.6 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 people at age 50.
   Cases attributable to smoking alone, when the gene is not
present, would be about 46.7 per 100,000, and cases due solely to
the gene would be about 46.4 per 100,000, he said.
   As the population ages, however, the effects of the gene shrink
while the influence of smoking alone goes up.
   At age 60, Sellers said, there would be 330 cases per 100,000
due to the interaction of the gene and smoking, with 473 cases
attributed to smoking alone and 116 to the gene alone.
   At age 70, said Sellers, the vast majority of lung cancers among
smokers must be attributed to smoking alone. He said the cases
resulting from an interaction of the gene and smoking would be
about 498 per 100,000, while the number attributable to smoking
alone would be 2,776 per 100,000. Cases among non-smoking carriers
of the gene would be 359 per 100,000.
   The study said the suggested gene, interacting with tobacco
smoke, would account for 69 percent of the lung cancer cases among
50-year-old smokers; 47 percent among smokers aged 60, and only 22
percent among those still smoking at age 70.
   ``We're reasonably confident that there is a gene involved
here,'' said Sellers, but identifying the gene will require
sophisticated genetic studies of blood samples. He researchers now
are collecting those blood samples.
   In a Journal editorial commenting on the study, George E.
Bonney, an epidemiologist at Howard University Cancer Center in
Washington, said the study was so large and the observed genetic
effect ``appears so strong'' that the conclusion about genes
influencing the early onset of lung cancer among smokers ``is
unlikely to be false.''
   The National Cancer Institute, which publishes the journal, is
one of the government's National Institutes of Health. Studies in
the journal are evaluated by experts in the appropriate academic
fields before the work is published.

   Johnny Carson didn't monkey around when a zoo
in his native Nebraska needed help. He donated $55,000 to give
Reuben the chimp new digs.
   Northeast Nebraska Zoo has only one chimpanzee, but the donation
from ``The Tonight Show'' host may be enough to acquire a female
companion for Reuben as well as build a permanent primate exhibit,
zoo officials said.
   The 7-year-old chimp is housed in a fortified mobile home at the
zoo in rural Royal, near Carson's hometown of Norfolk, but the
monkey has grown too strong for his quarters.
   Construction should begin next week on a new enclosure.

   Bruce Springsteen's girlfriend and backup singer, Patty Scialfa,
gave birth to the boy July 25 at Cedar-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles. But it wasn't until Wednesday that the rock singer's
spokeswoman announced the baby's name.
   Evan James weighed in at 7 pounds, 11 ounces, publicist Marilyn
Laverty said.
   Ms. Scialfa, 36, joined Springsteen's E Street Band in 1984.
Springsteen, 40, was born and raised in New Jersey and has a home

   The first episode of Roseanne Barr's show since
she butchered the national anthem had an 11 percent smaller
audience than the week before.
   Tuesday's episode of ``Roseanne'' was a rerun.
   Larry Hyams, ABC director of prime-time audience research, on
Wednesday blamed the drop of nearly 1.5 million homes more on
strong CBS competition _ an installment of the 1987 miniseries
``Murder Ordained'' _ than to viewer backlash.
   The Nielsen ratings for NBC's competing series ``In the Heat of
the Night'' also were down from the previous Tuesday, he said.
   Barr's antics at a San Diego Padres baseball game last week
included grabbing her crotch and spitting on the ground.
   She drew the wrath of baseball fans and President Bush alike.
   Barr later apologized.

statement saying Iraqi troops crossed the border in response to a

   ``Iraq has responded to the request from interim government of
free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it,'' the statement said.
   It said the troops were in Kuwait to defend the revolution and
the Kuwaiti people. There was no further identification of the
revolutionary government.
   Iraq warned that any foreign troops trying to interfere with its
actions would be attacked.
   There was no immediate report on casualties.
   ``Our armed forces will close in an iron rank against those who
try to challenge us and will make Iraq and Kuwait a grave yard for
those who launch any aggression,'' the Iraqi statement said.
   It addeed that Iraq would withdraw its forces within days or
weeks depending on how fast the situation stabilized.
   The council announced a state of emergency and mass mobilization
in Iraq itself.
   The official radio started playing martial music.
   Iraq and Kuwait are OPEC partners but have had a long dispute
over their common border and oil revenues from a dispute oilfield.

<HEAD>Government Opens New Investigation into Murder of Solidarity
Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Ministry has launched a new
investigation into the 1984 police killing of a pro-Solidarity
priest to determine if higher-ups of the former Communist
government were involved.
   A new inquiry into the slaying of Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko
officially was opened July 24, the Justice Ministry said Tuesday in
a statement to the official PAP news agency.
   The murder of the popular priest shocked the nation, which last
year elected a Solidarity-led government to replace the Communists.
   Popieluszko's sermons counseling perseverance after the
imposition of martial law in 1981 to crush Solidarity had drawn
tens of thousands of people and made him a national symbol of
resistance to authoritarian Communist rule.
   Four Security Service officers were convicted in a hastily held
trial of abducting, beating and drowning Popieluszko in October
1984, but Communist prosecutors at the time said there was no
evidence of higher involvement.
   However, the convicted ringleader of the killers, Capt. Grzegorz
Piotrowski, hinted in a letter to former Interior Minister Gen.
Czeslaw Kiszczak made public last month that the killing had been
carried out with the knowledge of superiors.
   The opening of the new inquiry comes only three weeks after the
resignation of Kiszczak, who as head of the Interior Ministry was
in charge of the Security Service at the time of the Popieluszko
killing.
   The Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki now has a civilian in charge of the Interior Ministry
who is systematically scouring the department and replacing
personnel.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, proposing an orderly,
long-term reduction in the nation's military arsenal, is backing a
25 percent cut in the armed forces by the mid-1990s, administration
and Pentagon sources say.
   Bush was slated to make the proposal in a speech today in Aspen,
Colo., as his $307 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991 has come
under severe attack on Capitol Hill.
   ``The president will lay out the broad outlines of his new
strategy for the nation's defenses and how our military must
respond, based on the changes in the world that have occurred,''
said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In a speech to the Aspen Institute, Bush planned to offer
support for two hotly debated weapons programs _ the B-2 stealth
bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative _ and support a 25
percent cut in the armed forces by the end of 1995, the source said.
   A similar cut in the nation's arsenal of troops and weapons was
laid out by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney as an option for budget
negotiators in June, but it was derided as ``overly cautious'' by
critics seeking additional budget savings.
   Bush planned to make the address after conferring with British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Aspen. It will be the fourth
time Bush and Mrs. Thatcher have met in as many months.
   Bush's speech comes two days after the House Armed Services
Committee cut $24 billion from the $307 billion the president had
requested for defense spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The panel voted to halt production of the B-2 bomber and slashed
almost $2 billion from Bush's request of $4.7 billion from the
anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star
Wars. It also cut military personnel by 129,500 and scaled back on
two nuclear missile programs.
   In June, Cheney said a 25 percent force reduction could save
$8.6 billion over five years as the Pentagon retired six active
duty Army divisions, 111 Navy ships and 11 Air Force tactical
fighter wings, and removed 442,000 men and women from the
military's 2.1-million-member active duty ranks.
   Appearing Wednesday evening on public television's
``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour,'' the defense secretary hinted that even
more changes could be in store. He said he had ``new base
closings'' to announce, possibly as early as next week.
   But Cheney also complained that while the House wanted him to
cut personnel, members were balking at closing unneeded bases.
   Bush said on July 20 at a Strategic Air Command base in
Cheyenne, Wyo., that, ``We must have an orderly build-down, not
some kind of a fire sale'' in defense.
   He indicated then that he could live with the $18 billion that
the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to cut from his defense
budget, but he implored Congress to ``hold the line at (that)
already painful reduction.''
   The senior American official said the president's remarks would
follow along the lines of those made by Cheney and Gen. Colin
Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Both have called repeatedly for an orderly, planned reduction in
troop strength so that the all-volunteer force is not gutted and
morale destroyed.
   Powell has ordered a study to assess the ``base line force''
that the nation needs to be a superpower, another source said.
   Mrs. Thatcher is scheduled to address the closing session of the
Aspen Institute conference on Sunday. Like Bush, she is under
pressure at home to deliver a peace dividend reflecting the
changing face of Europe and reduced East-West tensions.
   While the United States grapples with how to reduce the Pentagon
budget, Mrs. Thatcher's defense secretary, Tom King, announced
plans last week to reduce the size of the British army by 25
percent over five to seven years and cut its forces in West Germany
in half. King also outlined cuts in the British air force and navy
but said Britain would retain its nuclear arsenal.
   Cheney was flying separately to Aspen to attend the symposium at
the non-profit institute, marking its 40th anniversary of bringing
political, business and cultural leaders together to discuss global
issues.

<HEAD>House OKs Farm Bill Despite Administration Opposition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House easily approved a 1990 farm bill
that limits subsidies but is faulted by the Bush administration for
not achieving enough savings.
   ``I think the basic skeleton of legislation will stay
together,'' Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, said Wednesday night after the House's 327-91 vote. ``The
main problem is going to be numbers, with the budget summit.''
   The administration has threatened a veto if costs in the bill
are not decreased.
   ``The administration wants no program,'' said de la Garza.
``They are trying to use the budget to achieve that end.''
   But he said the votes in the House and Senate, where a version
of the bill was approved 70-21 last Friday, show strong
congressional intent to continue farm support programs.
   The cost for the price support programs in the bill is between
$53 billion and $55 billion over the measure's five-year life,
nearly the same as the Senate version.
   Besides setting subsidy levels for many crops, the legislation
establishes programs for agricultural exports, nutrition,
conservation, food safety, forestry, research and virtually every
other endeavor of the Agriculture Department. Congress writes a new
farm bill every five years.
   The support limits in the House bill represent a critical
difference with the Senate measure. De la Garza said he believed
they would be retained by the joint conference committee that will
create a final version of the legislation.
   Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois, ranking Republican on the
Agriculture Committee, voted against the bill, saying it would be
too costly.
   He said he thought it more closely resembled the policies of the
1981 law, which led to record spending, than the 1985 law that
Congress and the administration said initially would be the 1990
bill's model.
   Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., an Agriculture Committee member,
offered the amendment to the bill that caps subsidy payments. That
proposal, approved 375-45, would impose limits of:
   _$100,000 a year on the total deficiency payments paid to a
single farmer. These are the direct subsidies paid when market
prices are below a target price established by the government.
   _$100,000 a year on marketing loans to one farmer. This is the
money farmers keep if world prices are less than the government
established loan rate paid farmers to cover the cost of planting.
   _$200,000 a year on all payments to a single farmer.
   Supporters of Huckaby's amendment fended off a coalition led by
Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., who wanted $50,000 limits on the
payments and other restrictions.
   The House also put the honey program on a sliding subsidy scale,
going from a maximum $200,000 per producer in 1991 to $100,000 in
1994.
   The debate over limiting subsidy payments led to angry shouting
between members about fiscal responsibility. The most emotional
moments, however, came when Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., proposed to
cut spending on food stamps and other nutrition programs that were
expanded by the bill.
   That section of the legislation is called the Mickey Leland
Domestic Hunger Relief Act, in memory of the Texas congressman
killed last August in a plane crash in Ethiopia while visiting
refugee camps. Leland chaired the House Select Committee on Hunger.
   ``I think it's a sad commentary,'' Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
said of Frenzel's amendment.
   ``The costs of this bill are included in the budget resolution
and they meet the requirements of the budget resolution,'' said
Panetta, who is chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``In the
name of Mickey Leland, in the name of the right kind of priorities,
in the name of human decency, defeat this amendment.''
   The House agreed with Panetta, rejecting the amendment, 336-83.
   Other amendments added to the House bill Wednesday brought it
into conformity with the Senate breakthroughs in food safety and
environmental protection. These include a ban on exports of
pesticides not allowed for use in the United States and a
requirement that farmers keep records of the pesticides they use.

   The 1990 farm bill approved by the House calls
for about $53 billion to $55 billion in spending on crop support
programs over the five-year life of the bill. Here, at a glance,
are the major provisions and how they compare to the Senate version
of the bill.
   
   The bill:
   
   _Freezes target prices at $4 a bushel for wheat; $2.75 a bushel
for corn, $2.61 for sorghum; $2.36 for barley; 73 cents a pound for
cotton and $$10.71 per hundred pounds for rice. Same as Senate.
Oats would be set at $1.55 for 1991, with an increase each year of
10 cents up to a maximum of $1.85. Same as Senate.
   _Freezes milk prices at $10.10 per hundred pounds. Same as
Senate.

<HEAD>Interferon Provides First Cure for Hepatitis B</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Scientists today reported finding the first
treatment capable of relieving and even curing chronic hepatitis B,
one of the world's biggest killers.
   A study in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that
shots of a synthetic form of the natural protein interferon can
prevent the virus from destroying the liver in nearly half the
people chronically infected.
   One in 10 victims can be cured, while the drug had no benefits
for 60 percent of the 169 people studied in clinical trials,
researchers said.
   Hepatitis B is the chief underlying cause of liver cancer and
cirrhosis and the world's ninth-leading cause of death, just behind
lung disease and well ahead of AIDS, according to the World Health
Organization.
   An estimated 1 million to 1.5 million people in the United
States are long-term carriers of the hepatitis B virus. At least
half of them have liver disease. Worldwide, 300 million people, or
5 percent of the world's population, are chronically infected.
   Until now, there has been no treatment or cure for the virus.
   ``This is an encouraging result. All of us would feel a lot
happier if we had a better treatment. This spurs us on to find
that,'' said Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg of the Fox Chase Cancer Center
in Philadelphia.
   Blumberg won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1976 for identifying
the virus.
   The latest research, which involved 169 people at 12 hospitals,
confirms several smaller studies suggesting that interferon works.
   Other studies have also shown that interferon works against
hepatitis C, another serious but less common variety of the virus.
   Although the Food and Drug Administration has not yet
recommended interferon for hepatitis B, physicians can use it any
way they choose, and Blumberg said some doctors have already begun
prescribing it for this disease.
   Doctors said the latest study is big enough so physicians can
use the results to predict how interferon will affect their
patients if _ as seems likely _ it becomes the standard medicine
for hepatitis B.
   ``We can be relatively sure what doctors will find in practice:
Ten percent will be cured and 40 or 50 percent will be made better
and their liver disease will be stopped in its tracks,'' said Dr.
Robert P. Perrillo of the St. Louis Veterans Affairs Medical
Center, the principal author of the study.
   He defined a cure as the complete disappearance of the virus.
   Experts cautioned the treatment should be used only for those
with chronic infections who show signs of liver damage.
   The results were published along with an editorial by Dr. Jay H.
Hoofnagle of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases.
   ``For now, interferon alpha offers the best hope'' for treating
chronic hepatitis B, Hoofnagle wrote.
   Hepatitis is likely to become the first major use for
interferon. Isolating the natural disease-fighting substance was
one of the early goals of genetic engineering.
   In a decade of testing, interferon has turned out to be useful
against a variety of diseases, none as common as hepatitis. The FDA
has approved use of the drug for hairy-cell leukemia, AIDS-related
Kaposi's sarcoma and genital warts.
   In hepatitis B, Perrillo said the treatment appears to offer the
best chance of a cure if given during the first two years of
infection.

   Here are some facts and figures on Iraq:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND _ Iraq, the biblical Mesopotamia, or ``the land between two
rivers,'' took its name from ``uruq,'' Arabic for rocks.
Present-day Iraq covers 263,090 square miles with mountains in the
north and marshy flatlands in the south. The Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers converge in the southeast to form the 120-mile waterway
known as Shatt-al-Arab that flows into the Persian Gulf.
   Iraq is bounded by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, the
Persian Gulf to the southeast, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to the south
and Jordan and Syria to the west.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PEOPLE _ A majority of Iraq's 16 million people are Shiite
Moslems, but the country is ruled by Sunni Moslems. There are small
Christian communities and an enclave in the north where most of the
country's rebellious 3.5 million Kurds live. The national language
is Arabic, spoken by 81 percent of the population, while another 15
percent speak Kurdish. Baghdad, the capital, has approximately 4.6
million people.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY - Iraq has oil reserves of more than 100 billion
barrels. The 1980-88 war with Iran sent oil exports plummeting, but
the Iraqis built pipelines through neighboring Turkey and Saudi
Arabia and production is now back to at least 3 million barrels a
day. The war left Iraq with a foreign debt of about $70 billion.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY - Iraq, part of the Ottoman Empire from the 16th
century, was captured by British forces in 1916. In 1921 it became
a kingdom under a League of Nations mandate, administered by
Britain. Iraq became independent on July 14, 1958, in a coup which
established a military-led Council of Sovereignty headed by Gen.
Qassim.
   Qassim was overthrown in 1963 and Gen. Abdul Salam Aref became
president, succeeded by his brother, Abdul Rahman Aref, in 1966.
   In 1968 a successful coup brought by the Ba'th Party placed Gen.
Ahmed Al Bakr in power. Saddam Hussein, Bakr's vice president since
1969, became president in 1979 in a peaceful transfer of power.
   In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran in a territorial dispute over the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway that evolved into a nearly eight-year war. A
U.N. cease-fire halted the fighting on Aug. 20, 1988.

<HEAD>Charts Detail Alleged Drug Activity by Barry</HEAD>

   In the beginning there were the charts _ huge
sheets of cardboard resembling the visual aids a teacher uses to
hold the class' attention during a complicated lesson.
   There was the time-line chart, ranging from 1984 to 1990, with
bright red and green blocks signifying the months or seasons when
various witnesses said they had used drugs with Mayor Marion Barry.
   There was the lengthy ``Locations'' chart, subdivided into
hotels, businesses, private residences, government offices and
boats.
   And there was the ``Drug Activities with Charles Lewis'' chart,
neatly broken down by date, place and drug.
   Barry himself, subdued and somber, sat directly under the Lewis
chart during closing arguments in his drug and perjury trial
Wednesday. His chin resting in his hand, he listened intently as
Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin recapped allegation after
allegation of drug use and his own lawyer acknowledged that Barry
was a cocaine user.
   ``The chief executive officer of our city, the chief law
enforcement officer of our city ... was using drugs,'' Retchin said
emphatically to the jury, her gold earrings glinting and her hand
chopping the air.
   ``There are no saints among us,'' Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth
Mundy, said later, after the defense had covered up all the charts.
   The mayor swaggered in Wednesday wearing a bright yellow, red
and green kente cloth, an African neck scarf. But he took it off as
the jury filed in and the mood in the spare, crowded courtroom
turned businesslike. His wife and mother endured the proceedings
from the second row.
   Only 18 tickets were available to the public, and some people
came as early as 8 p.m. the night before in hopes of getting one.
The passes were distributed amid controversy over who had arrived
first. And someone who wasn't fast enough was thwarted trying to
enter the courtroom on a forged pass.
   Those who made it heard some brutally pointed final volleys from
Retchin.
   She called Barry paranoid, compulsive, irresponsible, a liar.
She compared him to the hub of a wheel, with spokes pointing to all
those who helped him maintain his secret drug habit. She likened
him to a child who blurted out a lie _ that he had not given his
friend Charles Lewis any drugs. She compared him, finally, to a
treacherous general abetting the enemy.
   ``It was his choice and he could not say no,'' she said. ``The
general was working with the other side.''
   Mundy, who was finishing his presentation today, maintained the
government had not proven its case. But his characterizations of
his client were scarcely more flattering than Retchin's.
   ``We do not intend to indicate or claim that Mr. Barry did not
use cocaine,'' he told the jury. ``Nor do we mean to indicate that
there was not some kind of conduct that was not popular or not
appropriate.''
   If Barry was particularly disturbed by any of this, he did not
show it by changing his expression. During breaks he casually
combed his hair, made a phone call, offered his opinions of the
sketches drawn by the front row of courtroom artists.
   The artists had started the day abuzz over an accusation by the
mayor's press secretary that they were deliberately darkening the
skin of a government prosecutor _ thus stressing that Barry was
being tried by a fellow man and, by implication, undercutting
charges that the government was unfairly going after black
officials.
   One artist for a television network contemplated the
professional problem of depicting a light-skinned black. ``Maybe I
need a new marker,'' she said. ``No one ever noticed this before.''

   The number of never-married women rearing
children on their own increased almost as much in a new two-year
survey as it had in the previous seven years, the Census Bureau
says.
   In a biennial report released Wednesday, the bureau and the
Department of Health and Human Services said that in 1987 there
were 2.6 million never-married women with children under 21 whose
fathers were absent from the home.
   In 1985, the last previous count, the figure was 2 million. In
1983, it was 1.9 million. It was 1.7 million in 1981 and 1.4
million in 1978, when the first survey was made.
   Although the survey showed that women were doing better than
previously at getting child support, those who had never married
were faring much more poorly than those who were divorced or
separated.
   The report said support payments received by women with children
under 21 in 1987 averaged $2,710, an increase of 16 percent over
1985 after adjusting for inflation.
   Of mothers who were separated or divorced, 74 percent were
getting child support. For those who had never married, the rate
was 20 percent.
   Commenting on the report, Jo Anne B. Barnhart, assistant
secretary of health and human services for family support, said,
``We must never lose sight of the fact that both parents have an
obligation to financially care for the children they bring into the
world.''
   HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan said the report ``indicates that
progress is being made, but vigorous enforcement of child support
laws must continue.''
   The report said 9.4 million women age 18 and over were rearing
children under 21 whose fathers were not living in the household.
This is an increase of 7 percent since 1985.
   The total amount of child support received in the year was $10
billion, or 69 percent of the total of $14.6 billion due.
   About one-third of the mothers were living in poverty. The
poverty rate for black women was 53 percent, about twice that for
white women but about the same as the rate for Hispanics.

<HEAD>Newspapers Hail End Of Most Censorship Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers that once trumpeted government
propaganda have now hailed the end of most censorship rules, even
printing the official approval stamp of the censor agency that was
once illegal to mention.
   ``Goodbye, censorship,'' read a headline in Izvestia about the
Soviet Union's first press freedom law, which took effect Wednesday
and guarantees broad rights for journalists and potential
publishers.
   ``Almost everything was forbidden, even mention of the existence
of (the censorship agency) Glavlit itself,'' said Izvestia, the
main government newspaper. ``The truth was the main secret.''
   Izvestia celebrated the occassion by publishing a photograph of
Glavlit's approval stamp on its front page.
   That minor act of rebellion marked a watershed day in the
gradual freeing of speech since Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power
in 1985.
   ``The press and other mass media are free'' and ``censorship of
the mass media is forbidden,'' says the new law passed by the
Supreme Soviet legislature in June after months of debate.
   Editors said in their news pages that the new legal guarantees
won't stop attempts at interference overnight. The new law does not
abolish Glavlit, which stands for the Main Administration for
Safeguarding State Secrets in the Press. Glavlit will still have
the power to censor articles construed as calling for the violent
overthrow of the government, promoting racial or religious
intolerance, or publishing propaganda for war, violence or cruelty.
   In addition, the shortage of newsprint and its increasing costs
could be a major barrier for independent publications.
   The most daring editors have been pushing the limits of
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, since he came to power.
   Tass, the official government news agency, already has a
competitor in Interfax, a news service set up by Radio Moscow last
year to earn hard currency. Sent to subscribers by facsimile
machine, Interfax quickly earned a place on the pages of world
newspapers with scoops like Gorbachev's plan to ask the Communist
Party to give up its monopoly on power.
   The government's Novosti press agency chose Wednesday to
announce that it is being transformed from a propaganda-publishing
institution to an ``information agency,'' albeit one dedicated to
reporting on Gorbachev's reform policy, called perestroika.
   ``It is felt that Tass and the daily newspapers must advise on
the events of the day, so we are obligated to integrate more
facts'' into our work, said Novosti chairman Albert Vlasov in
Izvestia on Wednesday.
   Just two weeks ago, Gorbachev issued a decree loosening controls
on the state television monopoly. Until then, only groups approved
by a state committee had access to Soviet television, and as a
result the Communist party received large segments of air time.
   The decree said no one party or group should monopolize air time.
   Some of the most dramatic changes are in the works at the feisty
weekly Moscow News, which is planning to go independent of Novosti,
selling stock, ads and subscriptions.
   Seven years ago, it was a multilingual propaganda sheet, known
for articles that claimed 12 million people were starving in the
United States. Now its weekly thrust into forbidden territory has
made it one of the most popular newspapers in the country.
   But its faithful readers must crowd around the copies posted on
the newspaper's wall in downtown Moscow because it has been barred
from selling subscriptions for its Russian-language edition inside
the Soviet Union.
   Editor Yegor Yakovlev announced in this week's edition that the
newspaper will ignore the restrictions and start a subscription
drive in hopes of earning enough to pay for the additional,
extremely scarce newsprint.
   Tass reported Wednesday that market reforms are bringing an
abrupt jump in the price of newsprint and printing services. It
predicted that the retail price of most publications will double
and that many of them will die off.
   To establish a new publication or news organization, the new law
says Soviets need only provide their name, address, frequency of
publication, circulation figures and source of financing.
   Journalists' new rights include the right to attend meetings and
be present at the scene of disasters, the right to refuse to
prepare reports that go against a journalist's convictions, and the
right to hold interviews with officials. They now can withdraw
their byline if the contents of a story are distorted by editing.

Security Adviser Scowcroft and has been receiving periodic updates
since.
   The United States is deeply concerned about this blatant act of
aggression and demands the immediate and unconditional withdrawal
of all Iraqi forces.
   We do not have exact details at this time concerning the extent
of the Iraqi action although it is clearly extensive. We have no
reports of any harm to American citizens. The State Department is
in constant contact with our embassy in Kuwait concerning the
status of U.S. citizens.
   At the urging of Kuwait and the United States, the United
Nations Security Council will be meeting early this morning to
consider this matter. In addition, we have been informed that the
Arab League and the Organization of the Islamic Conference will be
convening to review the situation.
   We are urging the entire international community to condemn this
outrageous act of aggression. The United States is reviewing all
options in its response to the Iraqi aggression.

   President Bush is relying on the Senate to
salvage his 1991 military budget after the House Armed Services
Committee significantly cut the B-2 bomber and the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   The fate of the stealth aircraft, which at nearly $865 million
each is the costliest airplane ever built, was expected to be the
first issue today as the Senate begins considering its version of
the defense bill.
   Bush, meanwhile, was expected to use an address today to call
for a 25 percent reduction in military forces by the mid-1990s
while maintaining support for the B-2 stealth bomber and the
anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative, administration and
Pentagon sources said.
   ``The president wants a rational build-down,'' one source said
in advance of Bush's planned speech at the Aspen Institute in
Aspen, Colo.
   Last month, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved a $289
billion defense package that leaves intact the president's request
for $4.6 billion for two radar-evading B-2 bombers in the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.
   Since the panel's action, congressional support for the planes
has continued to diminish, with the latest blow coming Tuesday
night when the House Armed Services Committee agreed to halt
production at the 15 bombers in development.
   The House panel also cut $24 billion from Bush's overall request
of $307 billion in military spending for fiscal 1991, slashed
nearly $2 billion from the budget request of $4.7 billion for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, and reduced military
personnel by 129,500.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee was kinder to Bush's
proposal, trimming $1 billion from SDI and cutting active duty
troop strength by 100,000 as well as agreeing to the B-2 request.
   Possible amendments to the defense bill include one from Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, and Sen. John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican, to set aside procurement money for
the B-2 until critical tests have been completed.
   That provision may undermine harsher amendments that could come
from Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine and Democratic Sen.
Patrick Leahy of Vermont.
   One amendment from the two B-2 opponents would halt production
of the aircraft for one year. Another amendment would allow six
planes to be built and the testing program to continue.
   Privately, lawmakers who oppose the aircraft say they have 40
votes to prevent Bush from building a fleet of 75 aircraft.
Recently, Nunn and Warner warned the president that unless he
lobbies personally for the aircraft, it will fail in the Senate.
   But their possible amendment might prevent the B-2 program's
demise in the Senate.
   Other possible amendments include one to reduce funds for the
Phase 1 of the SDI program, restore the $1.1 billion that the
Senate panel eliminated for the MILSTAR communications satellite
program and a provision to cut U.S. troops in South Korea from
45,000 to 30,000.
   One provision certain to set off a firestorm of protest, and
possibly delay completion of the bill, is an amendment to permit
abortions at military hospitals abroad.
   Currently a ban exists on using Defense Department money to pay
for abortions, except when the life of the mother is in danger. The
ban does not say whether military personnel who pay for the
procedure can use government facilities.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., co-sponsor of the amendment, said in a
recent interview that ``enlisted people in the military should not
be treated like second-class citizens.''

<HEAD>Soviets to End Production of Rail-Based ICBM</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IRKUTSK, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union announced today that
it will stop making a rail-based mobile intercontinental ballistic
missile, but did not commit itself to removing those already in
place.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze made the announcement
after two days of talks in this eastern Siberian city with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and before reporters had
learned of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Both officials told reporters outside a guest house where they
met that their 10 hours of discussions produced no major
breakthroughs on what had been expected to be their main focus, the
12-year-old civil war in Afghanistan.
   But the announcement about the Soviet SS-24 missile indicated
they had made some progress on arms control.
   The meeting, the 11th this year between Baker and Shevardnadze,
was the most informal. The diplomats cruised the Angara River and
went fishing. Shevardnadze landed a trout, but Baker came away
empty-handed.
   Shevardnadze, standing along with Baker on a patio, said the
Soviet military would cease production of the missiles on Jan. 1.
He said the Soviet military would continue to deploy until 1991
``not many'' of the missiles it has already produced.
   The removal of missiles already in place, he said, was a subject
of negotiations between U.S. and Soviet teams in Geneva.
   According to the 1989 edition of the annual U.S. Defense
Department publication ``Soviet Military Power,'' the Soviet Union
began deploying the rail-based version of the SS-24 missile in 1987
and had about 58 of them.
   The SS-24 carries 10 warheads and has a range of abut 6,200
miles. Limits on mobile land-based missiles were one of the
outstanding issues in START talks on slashing the superpowers'
stockpiles of long-range nuclear weapons.
   Other bigger sticking points in the negotiations are curbs on
modernizing the Soviet Union's biggest strategic missile, the
SS-18, and the Backfire bomber, and on transfers of missiles to
third countries.
   Shevardnadze did not say why the Soviet Union was taking the
step, but the Kremlin is under pressure to cut its defense budget
so it can spend the money on solving chronic economic problems.
   ``We welcome the announcement,'' Baker said before flying to
Mongolia for the last stop on his four-nation Asian tour. He added,
however, that ``It doesn't at this point, at least, change our
negotiating position in START.''
   U.S. officials indicated earlier this year that they might offer
to give up plans for a rail-based MX missile if the Soviets give up
the SS-24.
   Baker and Shevardnadze discussed the war in Afghanistan on
Wednesday night and this morning, but the Soviet envoy told
reporters, ``I cannot say we can report any kind of breakthrough on
Afghanistan.''
   The Soviets arm the Afghan government, while the Americans
supply the guerrillas fighting it with military aid.
   Baker told reporters there were two main stumbling blocks to a
settlement:
   _The makeup of a commission to ensure ``free and fair''
elections.
   _Which powers the current government, headed by pro-Soviet
President Najibullah, might transfer to an interim government
during elections so candidates are ensured a ``fair shake.''
   Baker said Soviet and American experts will try to resolve
differences over these points when they meet in Washington. He did
not say when the meeting would take place.
   U.S. and Soviet officials reportedly have been working on a plan
for Najibullah to hand over some power to a council of Afghan
forces as a run-up to a nationwide election.
   The composition of the council is now in dispute. U.S.-backed
Afghan rebels disagree about who should be on the council. Baker
alluded to that at the news conference.
   ``We are moving closer together on Afghanistan. Having said
that, I don't think you should take that to mean necessarily that
those whose interests we have been allied with in the past are
necessarily moving together,'' he said.
   In three meetings, including one Wednesday night in a river-side
fishing lodge in the Siberian wilderness, Baker and Shevardnadze
also discussed preparations for a third summit meeting between Bush
and Gorbachev.
   Shevardnadze said not date had been decided for the summit, but
that it would be held in Moscow. He also announced that Baker, U.S.
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and leading American
businessmen would travel to Moscow in September for talks on
U.S.-Soviet economic cooperation.
   Baker indicated this primarily would involve ways of stimulating
U.S. business investment in the Soviet Union, in dire need of
Western help to cure its ailing economy.
   A Soviet source said that during their Wednesday morning
meeting, Shevardnadze gave Baker a 15-page outline of areas for
economic and scientific cooperation. The envoys meet next in Moscow
on Sept. 12.

<HEAD>Drug Dealer, Investors, Bankrupt Firms Among Biggest Scofflaws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the 13 million scofflaws who owe a
total of $66 billion in federal taxes are ordinary workers and
businesses, but the biggest include a drug dealer, some rich oil
investors and a half-dozen giant bankrupt companies.
   The Internal Revenue Service says 21 taxpayers owe more than $50
million apiece, a total of $3.6 billion among them. About 3,300 are
responsible for more than $14.5 billion of the agency's accounts
receivable.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr. told the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday that the agency is
making progress in reducing accounts receivable, which are taxes
that have been assessed but not paid.
   He noted, for example, that the IRS this year is collecting
$472,000 in delinquencies for each staffer in the collections
division, up from $388,000 two years ago.
   ``At the same time, however, I want to emphasize that we have a
long way to go and the task is exceedingly difficult,'' Goldberg
said. Making a serious dent in accounts receivable, he said, will
require modernization of the agency's 30-year-old computer system,
more money for more personnel and training and further
simplification of tax laws.
   Paul L. Posner, associate director of Congress' General
Accounting Office, said the IRS is losing the battle because
accounts receivable over the past six years grew twice as fast as
total tax receipts. Continuation of that trend ``could have a
serious negative impact on voluntary taxpayer compliance,'' he said.
   ``This rapid, out-of-control growth in unpaid taxes threatens to
overwhelm the IRS and is absolutely unacceptable,'' said Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee.
   Accounts receivable grew from $30 billion in 1984 to $66 billion
last year. The figure represents a six-year accumulation of income,
payroll and other taxes assessed but not paid. It does not include
$27 billion that the IRS believes will never be collected because
of death, bankruptcy and inability to locate the debtor.
   Because of errors and duplication, the IRS and GAO agree the $66
billion figure may be exaggerated by as much as 50 percent.
   Accounts receivable are not the same as the ``tax gap,'' which
is the difference in income taxes that are collected and what would
be collected if individuals and businesses correctly reported their
income and deductions. The gap is expected to be about $100 billion
this year alone.
   Goldberg said 0.25 percent of the accounts receivable cases
represent more than 20 percent of delinquent dollars.
   Other highlights:
   Six cases totaling $1.4 billion involve bankruptcies; five cases
totaling $1.06 billion involve erroneous assessments (IRS made
three of the errors and taxpayers made two) and are being closed;
one $61 million case is awaiting a court decision; one worth $73
million involves an unidentified drug dealer.
   Two cases worth $191 million involve a dispute over the
now-repealed windfall-profits tax on oil production, and $362
million at stake in two cases likely will never be paid for a
variety of reasons, including fraudulent investments.
   Goldberg said President Bush's IRS budget for next year is a
good start toward reducing accounts receivable because it would
allow hiring 1,050 new collection personnel. He said a two-year
hiring freeze has left the agency is such a state that nearly
800,000 accounts totaling $1.8 billion cannot be worked because of
lack of personnel.
   John Pepping, an IRS collections officer in the Laguna Niguel,
Calif., district, said the personnel shortage there is so severe
that as a rule, no account under $50,000 is sent to the field for
collection. He testified on behalf of the National Treasury
Employees Union, which represents most IRS workers.

<HEAD>Murder Charges Said Aimed at Preventing Revelations of Army
Trafficking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Filipino authorities claim
that murder charges against three Americans and 13 Filipinos were
filed to keep them from exposing narcotics trafficking within the
military.
   On Wednesday, the military charged three Drug Enforcement
Administration agents and 13 Filipino policemen with murder in the
killings of three soldiers, including two officers, during a
reported drug bust last month.
   In Washington, the acting chief of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, Terrence Burke, said the allegations against his
men ``have no merit.''
   The DEA suggested the charges may have been intended to prevent
the three agents from testifying about drug trafficking by Filipino
military officials.
   Today, Epimaco Velasco, the most senior Filipino charged in the
incident, resigned as assistant director of the National Bureau of
Investigation. He called the allegations ``malicious, unfounded and
baseless.''
   ``This is a very sad day ... for other peacekeeping and law
enforcement people because for performing their duty, this is what
they get,'' Velasco said. ``Do you mean to say that if military
people are involved, we will just close our eyes and let these
things go?''
   Brig. Gen. Gerardo Flores, chief of staff of the Philippine
Constabulary, filed charges against Philip Needham of the DEA's
Bangkok office, Andrew Fenrich, chief of the DEA section in Manila,
and DEA agent Jake Fernandez.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said all three left the
country and ``have no plans to return.''
   Flores said 10 of the Filipinos were charged before a military
court. The Integrated National Police is part of the armed forces.
Under Philippine law, prosecutors decide whether to indict those
charged by police.
   The charges stem from a July 10 incident in which Col. Rolando
de Guzman, deputy chief of the Northern Luzon Command; his
intelligence officer, Maj. Frank Calanog, and another soldier were
slain during what police said was a shootout during a drug bust.
   DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty said in Washington that the
agency was invited to testify before a commission formed by
President Corazon Aquino to investigate allegations of drug
trafficking by members of her armed forces.
   He said Fenrich had planned to testify, but the charges ``rather
effectively put the kibosh on any testimony about the facts
concerning the armed forces. ... I'm suggesting there's probably a
cause-and-effect situation there.''
   The National Bureau of Investigation claims de Guzman and the
other soldiers tried to sell $10 million worth of heroin to
Needham, who was posing as a buyer. Shooting broke out when the
three resisted arrest, it claims.
   U.S. Embassy officials have not commented on the incident.

<HEAD>HHS Won't Help Pay Hospital Costs for AIDS Experiments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The same federal department that leads the
fight against AIDS refuses to help pay the hospital costs of poor
people who receive experimental drugs for AIDS-related infections.
   That policy of the Department of Health and Human Services
blocks treatment of thousands of people whose AIDS-weakened immune
systems make them the prey of microbes that most people would only
sneeze at, witnesses told a House Government Operations
subcommittee Wednesday.
   HHS also governs the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which
refuse to allow reimbursement for experimental treatments, even if
those are the only effective ones available for AIDS-related
infections.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, head of AIDS research in HHS, was among
the critics of that policy.
   ``We do not agree from the biomedical, research and health care
delivery standpoint with that philosophy,'' said Fauci, director of
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the
National Institutes of Health.
   Fauci told the subcommittee on human resources and
intergovernmental relations that he has brought up the gap in
biweekly meetings of the interagency HIV Leadership Group. HIV is
the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS.
   The response within the department is that ``they were very
sympathetic with the difficulties this is posing for us in the
conduct of our trials, but a solution is not readily at hand,''
Fauci said.
   He said the problem is an unwillingness to spend more money on
reimbursements that are already stretching the government for
non-experimental hospitalizations.
   Hospitalization is required for AIDS patients with opportunistic
infections _ those that a person with a normal immune system would
resist _ because such infections are usually acute and patients
must be monitored around the clock, said Dr. Fred R. Sattler of the
University of Southern California's School of Medicine.
   The hearing was called to examine the status of research into
drugs used to prevent or treat opportunistic infections, and the
priority given by the NIH to research into those drugs rather than
an overall cure for AIDS.
   The institutes have recently indicated they would spend a larger
share on the drugs against opportunistic infections. NIH announced
Tuesday that it would give $2.8 million to six teams of scientists
for research on such drugs.

<HEAD>Nine Candidates Vie to Lead Alaska Through Expected Oil Bust of
1990s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN S. AKRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's next governor knows that as the
flow of Alaskan oil dwindles in the '90s, so will the river of
petrodollars that has filled the state treasury for more than a
decade.
   The hard part will be convincing Alaskans that oil's free ride
is almost over and that they may have to start paying their own way
for state services.
   And so the nine candidates vying to succeed Democratic Gov.
Steve Cowper are skirting specifics about what programs they would
cut to deal with the massive deficits forecast for the coming
decade. And no candidate has embraced new taxes as a solution.
   ``It would be suicide for anyone to come out and be very
specific about what they would do,'' said Clive Thomas, a political
science professor at the University of Alaska Southeast. ``If they
did they would not win.''
   Part of the problem for the candidates is that many Alaskans
have been lulled into a false sense of security about the economy,
Thomas said. Employment and wages are up, homes are selling and
international trade is growing.
   ``How do you lead the Alaska public to believe they need to cut
back? Basically you're asking them to have a lower standard of
living,'' Thomas said. ``That's not going to go down well with
people.''
   Dave Dittman, an Anchorage pollster, agrees. He said most
Alaskans feel they are doing well, and they don't want to hear
threatening talk of another oil-related recession.
   ``They don't want a change. They're not looking for a Moses.
They want a guardian, someone who can protect their interests,''
Dittman said.
   Oil taxes and royalties support 85 percent of the state budget.
Alaska has no statewide sales or income taxes. The next governor
likely will be forced to propose broad cuts, new taxes or both.
   Of the nine candidates vying to replace Cowper, who announced in
March 1989 that he would not seek a second term, five are
considered serious contenders for the Republican and Democratic
nominations in the Aug. 28 primary.
   The frontrunner in the GOP race is state Sen. Arliss
Sturgulewski of Anchorage, who lost to Democrat Cowper in 1986. The
other main GOP contenders are Jim Campbell, a former Anchorage
assemblyman and businessman; and state Sen. Rick Halford, who
operates a hunting lodge and flying service.
   The Democratic race is between former Anchorage Mayor Tony
Knowles and Lt. Gov. Stephen McAlpine.
   So far the differences among the candidates have been less
obvious than the similarities. All say they favor environmentally
responsible oil exploration and development, and all say Alaska
needs to expand its development of other natural resources as well.
   Their campaign commercials have been full of feel-good images,
cliches about leadership and the ``Alaska spirit,'' and little else.
   ``No one, in my opinion, has really taken anything on,'' Dittman
said. ``They're all saying the same thing in a very typical,
non-creative manner.''
   That may be changing as the primary nears. The Republican
contest recently began to heat up when Campbell, in commercials
aired in Anchorage and Fairbanks, challenged the legislative
records of Sturgulewski and Halford.
   Many observers expect the Democratic race to heat up as well if
McAlpine continues to lag behind Knowles in the polls in the final
weeks.
   The lesser known candidates are Republican Don Wright, a retired
construction contractor from Fairbanks making his fourth bid;
Democrat Ryal White, an Anchorage construction worker; and Alaska
Independence Party candidates John Lindauer of Anchorage and
William DeRushe of North Pole.
   The feisty Campbell is the only candidate who has been moving up
significantly in the polls recently. He said he's now aiming
primarily at Sturgulewski.
   Sturgulewski responded quickly to the Campbell commercials,
using humor to counter what she saw as a subtle reference to her
gender.
   In one of the Campbell ads, the narrator speaks of the need to
maintain state roads and buildings. He concludes: ``Maintenance
isn't sexy, it's just wise. You can vote sexy or you can vote
wise.''
   After responding to Campbell's other charges, the matronly
Sturgulewski looks into the camera and says, ``He's even accused me
of being sexy. Well, he might be right about that.''

<HEAD>U.S. Relations With Persian Gulf Countries Often Rocky</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-US-Iraq-Kuwait</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has viewed the oil-rich
Persian Gulf region as a vital part of the world since the end of
World War II and has deployed a continuous naval presence in the
region since the late 1940s.
   The United States has based its policy in the region on the need
to maintain the free flow of oil from Saudi Arabia, with the
world's largest proven oil reserves, and Iraq, which ranks second
in proven reserves.
   But U.S. relations with the major powers in the area _ Iraq,
Iran and Saudi Arabia _ have often been rocky.
   With the outbreak of the 1967 Middle East war between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, Iraq broke relations with the United States
over its support for Israel, and U.S.-Iraqi relations plunged into
a deep freeze for more than 15 years.
   Iraq was placed on a list of countries that support terrorism as
the United States accused the Baghdad government of financing
Palestinian terrorist movements.
   The region grew even more vital to this country when the
oil-producing Arab countries imposed an embargo against the United
States and other Western nations in 1973, sending oil prices
soaring and exposing the vulnerability of U.S. consumers to the
volatile developments in the Persian Gulf.
   As relations with Iraq and the other oil producers deteriorated,
U.S. links to the government of Iran improved. Iran, too, was rich
in oil and the United States could count on steady supplies from
the late Shah Reza Pahlavi in return for consistent sales of
American weaponry to build up his military forces.
   Relations with Iran came to an abrupt and tragic end when Moslem
Shiite fundamentalists under the spiritual guidance of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini deposed the shah and took over the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran, holding more than 50 Americans hostage for 444 days
beginning in 1979.
   With its relations with Baghdad and Tehran mired in hostility,
the United States strove to develop good ties with the small
monarchies bordering Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
   These oil-rich countries, in the shadow of their powerful
neighbors, turned to the United States for weapons sales and
political support. Their dependence on the United States grew as
Iraq became increasingly menacing after it launched its September
1980 war against Iran.
   Official U.S. policy was to remain neutral in the eight-year
war. But in an effort to obtain the release of American hostages
held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Moslem extremists, the United States
in 1985 began secret arms sales to the Khomeini government.
   Just before that, the United States and Iraq resumed diplomatic
relations, but the United States refused to sell Iraq any weapons.
   As the war dragged on and both combatants launched a barrage of
attacks on oil tankers plying the gulf, the United States spread
its protection over Kuwait, agreeing to put U.S. flags on Kuwaiti
oil tankers. Ships from the U.S. Seventh Fleet escorted Kuwaiti
tankers through the gulf.
   Although still remaining neutral, the U.S. action was seen as
benefiting Iraq because it helped keep open the shipping channel
that Iraq needed to get its oil to foreign markets.
   With the end of the Iran-Iraq war, the United States set about
to substantially improve relations with the government of Saddam
Hussein, extending credit programs for U.S. farm sales to Iraq.
   U.S. oil companies sharply increased their purchases from Iraq,
providing the Iraqi government with badly needed cash. American
businesses pressed the Bush administration to provide additional
loan guarantees so they could enjoy an expected boom from Iraq's
postwar reconstruction.
   However, tensions between Washington and Baghdad escalated again
earlier this year when U.S. Customs agents, in cooperation with
British authorities, intercepted a shipment of devices said to be
intended for Iraq's nuclear program. Iraq vehemently denied the
allegation, but Congress was skeptical, citing Iraq's continued
development of chemical weapons.
   In recent days both the House and Senate have moved to adopt
sanctions against Iraq, even as the administration was considering
similar steps of its own.

<HEAD>US Condemns Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait; Is ``Reviewing Options''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBs 9th graf: ``The United,'' to point out that Gulf patrols

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration condemned Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait early Thursday morning and said it was
``reviewing all options in its response to the Iraqi aggression.''
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the United States
deplored ``this blatant use of military aggression'' and called for
``the immediate and unconditional withdrawal'' of hostile troops
from Kuwait.
   Popadiuk said national security officials were monitoring the
hostilities but had no exact details about the extent of the Iraqi
offensive. Iraq claimed in a radio broadcast from Baghdad that it
had overthrown the sheikdom.
   A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity said of
Iraq's claims, ``We don't think that's the case.'' Nevertheless,
this official said Iraqi troops had moved into the capital city in
force.
   ``They seem to have taken over several government buildings,''
the official said.
   The White House said it had no reports of harm to Americans. The
United States has extensive business ties to Kuwait, and the State
Department said 3,800 Americans were believed to be in Kuwait at
the time of the invasion. The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait has a staff of
about 80, half of them military.
   ``The United States is deeply concerned about this blatant act
of aggression and demands the immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of all Iraqi forces. We are urging the entire
international community to condemn this outrageous act of
aggression,'' Popadiuk said in a statement read to news
organizations in a 1:30 a.m. conference call.
   In addition, the spokesman said the administration was
``reviewing all options in its response to the Iraqi aggression.''
   The United States, whose Persian Gulf naval patrols protecting
U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers helped Iraq defeat Iran in the
1980-1988 war, has six warships in the area. They have been
conducting exercises since July 24 with forces of the United Arab
Emirates, some 700 miles southeast of Kuwait.
   The naval force includes four frigates, one destroyer and the
command ship USS La Salle. Two KC-135 aerial refueling tankers also
have been taking part in the exercises.
   The nearest aircraft carrier battle group, the most powerful
naval force in the fleet, is headed by the carrier USS Independence
somewhere in the Indian Ocean. That could be about 800 miles from
Kuwait, where the gulf opens into the Indian Ocean at the Straits
of Hormuz _ or it could be many thousands of miles away. Pentagon
officials declined to identify the carrier's whereabouts.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft was chairing a hastily
assembled task force in the White House situation room, Popadiuk
said. President Bush was informed of the invasion about 9 p.m.
Wednesday.
   A State Department official said the department had received
reports of gunfire in the heart of Kuwait city, which sits on the
gulf, and there appeared to be ``some penetration'' into the heart
of the country.
   Popadiuk said the White House delivered its message to the Iraqi
ambassador in Washington and to the Iraqi government through the
U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
   The Kuwaiti embassy in Washington confirmed Iraq had launched an
offensive. Faleh Bader, director of the ambassador's office, said,
``We confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no
comment.''
   The attack started about midnight, Kuwaiti time (5 p.m. EDT),
Bader said.
   Hours before the attack, Iraq's ambassador, Mohamed Al-Mashat,
was summoned to the State Department for a meeting with Assistant
Secretary John Kelly.
   Kelly repeated to the Iraqi envoy the U.S. desire for a peaceful
solution to the tensions with Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to
sovereignty of all nations in the region.
   Kelly told a House subcommittee Tuesday that while the United
States has no treaty obligations that would mandate military
support for Kuwait, the United States does believe strongly in
respect for territories of all states in the region.
   Congress has been pressuring Bush to impose new sanctions on
Iraq over its belligerent moves toward Mideast neighbors. On
Wednesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved by voice
vote a bill seeking an end to Iraq's $200 million line of credit
through the Export-Import Bank.
   The measure also requires the United States to vote against any
loan sought by Iraq from international institutions like the World
Bank.
   It also would force any U.S. exporter wishing to sell items to
Iraq to first prove that they will not be used to develop chemical
or biological weapons or ballistic missiles, or to enhance Iraq's
ability to support terrorism.
   The bill's author, Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said the United
States must register its disapproval of Iraq's aggression.
   ``The lesson of Iraq is clear,'' Berman said. ``You win nothing
by appeasing a bully. He merely becomes a bolder and more dangerous
bully.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said late Wednesday night that the Iraqi offensive
``shows that dangers in that part of the world are becoming more
than just dangers and actual war.''
   Last week, similar sanctions were added to the 1990 farm bill
during House and Senate floor consideration. Those sanctions
included an end to U.S. loan guarantees under which Iraq now can
buy up to $1 billion a year in agricultural commodities.
   Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait
after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the
OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's
revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that
straddles the border.
   Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah,
Saudi Arabia aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis and
complained that Kuwait was not negotiating seriously.
   Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britain
ended its protectorate over Kuwait. Iraq then claimed Kuwait as
part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of
the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred
further action by Iraq.

   Congress, responding to a spate of ethics
scandals, is taking its first step toward curtailing lawmakers'
``money chase'' for campaign funds as senators also vote to quit
accepting outside speaking fees.
   The Senate's Democratic majority overrode Republican opposition
Wednesday night to approve the first change in federal election
laws since Congress voted 16 years ago to publicly finance and
limit spending on presidential elections in wake of the Watergate
scandal.
   On a 59-40, largely party-line vote, the Senate approved a
campaign finance bill to place similar limits on congressional
candidates' spending, provide them with subsidies to buy television
advertising and outlaw special-interest political action committees.
   ``We have a system out of control,'' said Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla., the bill's chief author. ``The money chase has not slowed
down.''
   House leaders hope to take up similar legislation Friday before
Congress begins a five-week vacation _ but without the ban on
political action committees, or PACs, that grew up after the 1974
law.
   Such committees contributed nearly one-fourth of the $185
million spent on Senate races and 45 percent of the money spent by
House winners in the 1988 election.
   Outnumbered Republicans, vehemently opposed to spending ceilings
and any form of public financing, said President Bush would veto
the Senate version.
   But leaders in both parties expressed some hope that a spotlight
on the fall election might force the White House into negotiations
when lawmakers return in September.
   ``The issue is going to get hotter, hotter and hotter as we move
toward November,'' said Boren. ``If I were president, I would want
to find a compromise for the members in my party before the
election.''
   Boren said the bill contains several measures that Bush said
must be part of any reform package: outlawing PACs, an end to
honoraria for speeches and a ban on incumbents' use of franking
privileges to mail newsletters at government expense to voters in
election years.
   Nonetheless, Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas complained
that the bill ``only reforms Republicans'' by limiting how much
money can be spent by candidates and their fund-raising national
and state party organizations, where the GOP excels.
   Untouched by the bill, Republicans complained, is the millions
of dollars in their members' dues that unions spend on voter
registration and turnout, 90 percent of it in favor of Democrats.
   ``In my view, the die is cast on this bill,'' Dole said. ``It
seems not possible, but it may be possible yet to arrive at a bill
a great majority could support. Maybe something will come out of
all of this.''
   Possible areas of compromise, according to congressional
sources, include uncapping how much candidates could raise in small
amounts from in-state donors, making unions disclose more of what
they spend on politics and reducing the impact of PACs without
outlawing them.
   Five Republicans _ one of them just disciplined and another
under investigation in ethics cases _ joined 54 Democrats in favor
of the bill. The only Democrat to oppose it was South Carolina Sen.
Ernest Hollings, who argues that anything short of a constitutional
amendment will fail to stem the influence of money in politics.
   The Republican supporters were Sens. John McCain of Arizona,
James Jeffords of Vermont, William Cohen of Maine, David
Durenberger of Minnesota and Larry Pressler of South Dakota.
   Durenberger was denounced by his colleagues on a 96-0 vote last
week for violating Senate rules by skirting the current limits on
honoraria through a book publishing deal.
   McCain _ along with four Democrats _ is among the ``Keating
Five'' senators now under investigation by the Senate Ethics
Committee for interceding with savings and loan regulators on
behalf of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   The regulators now claim that the collapse of the thrift last
year will cost taxpayers up to $2 billion. Its principal owner,
Phoenix financier Charles H. Keating Jr., had contributed a total
of $1.3 billion to the five senators' campaign efforts.
   The bill aims to close loopholes in the 1974 law that allowed
Keating and other executives to ``bundle'' contributions from their
employees and present them to candidates.
   By limiting for the first time how much state parties can spend
on elections, it also would effectively stop the use of those
organizations by wealthy contributors to funnel gifts in blocks of
$100,000 to presidential campaigns.
   Both Bush and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
received millions of dollars in 1988 through such back-door ``soft
money'' contributions not subject to Federal Election Commission
reporting requirements.

   Inspired by Hollywood Westerns, many
Europeans want to come to Wyoming and become cowboys. Most are plum
out of luck, pardner.
   Unless they have guaranteed job offers, there is no home on the
range for them.
   News reports earlier this year about a shortage of experienced
ranch hands whipped up a stampede of inquiries from would-be
cowboys in East Germany, Britain, Czechoslovakia, Australia and
Canada, state and private agencies say.
   Steffaen Petry, 22, was one of two East Germans to make his way
to Wyoming recently in search of ranch work.
   ``From the time I was very little, I wanted to be a cowboy,'' he
said through an interpreter last month. ``From a little boy, I knew
about John Wayne.''
   But both he and his countryman were turned down for lack of
experience and work papers, said Oralia Mercado, executive director
of Mountain Plains, a Casper organization that helps ranchers find
experienced hands.
   ``I've been getting a lot of calls,'' Mercado said Tuesday.
``Initially, it was five to 10 calls every half hour. One whole
day, that's all I did.''
   Foreigners looking for employment in the United States cannot
get a work visa without an American sponsor and a guaranteed job
offer. And getting a offer to work as a ranch hand isn't easy for a
European tenderfoot.
   Wyoming ranchers occasionally sponsor workers from Mexico and
Peru, where ranches are similar, with lots of wide open space for
grazing.But ranches in Europe don't offer experience that is
practical in Wyoming, Mercado said.
   ``Germany does not have a lot of land where they graze
animals,'' she said. ``They have lot of pastures and farms and that
will not qualify them for the type of work we are dealing with.''
   Petry spoke only one word of English _ ``cowboy'' _ when he
arrived at the Cheyenne airport in July. With help from an airport
maintenance worker and state officials he was taken in by rancher
Sloan Hale, who speaks German.
   For several weeks, Petry pulled weeds and planted trees on
Hale's ranch in Cheyenne, but Hale needed no permanent help and
Petry had to leave the state.
   Petry had sold all his possessions to get to Wyoming. He was
released last December from an East German prison after two years
behind bars for trying to escape to the West.
   ``Not until I am a real cowboy, after I work for a year as a
cowboy, will I wear a cowboy hat,'' he said. ``Then I will be a
real cowboy.''

   Key senators promise to question David H.
Souter closely on controversial issues, and the Supreme Court
nominee says he will be ready to respond when his confirmation
hearings begin next month.
   As he made his get-acquainted rounds on Capitol Hill, the
reserved federal judge from New Hampshire said Wednesday he is
looking forward to the start of the hearings Sept. 13. He suggested
that his appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee will end
his string of ``no comments.''
   ``It's going to destroy my reputation for not saying much,'' he
said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said he was favorably impressed
after meeting Souter.
   But Kennedy, a leading liberal, said Souter's apparent
opposition to some forms of affirmative action ``concerns me,'' and
he indicated he would question him on the issue at the confirmation
hearings.
   ``Those will be certainly matters that will be brought up,''
Kennedy said. ``The judge knows there will be a full and complete
hearing, a wide variety of different areas that are going to be
covered. I think that's what the Constitution requires.''
   In a 1976 commencement speech, Souter used the term
``affirmative discrimination'' in describing federal programs that
give special preferences to minorities.
   Souter also visited Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., who said
afterward the nominee told him he ``would be prepared to answer
questions on the issue of the right of privacy.''
   ``I don't think you ought to ask him would you reverse Roe vs.
Wade,'' the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion,
Heflin said. ``But I think you will find there are legitimate areas
of inquiry that will be raised.''
   Souter let others do the talking on the latest potentially
controversial issue to surface _ a legal brief he submitted to the
Supreme Court in a civil rights dispute 14 years ago.
   Souter was New Hampshire's attorney general in 1976, working for
arch-conservative Gov. Meldrim Thomson, when the state opposed a
federal regulation requiring states to submit racial breakdowns of
their employees.
   The regulation ``proceeds from the cynical assumption that the
fairest employer cannot be trusted any more than the most biased.
And it ends in treating every employer as if he were a suspected
bigot and lawbreaker,'' the brief said.
   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rule requires states
to submit a racial breakdown of employees as a means of assuring
equal opportunity for minorities.
   New Hampshire was the only state that challenged the regulation.
The state's position was defended Wednesday by Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., a leading supporter of Souter's nomination.
   Rudman said the EEOC case originated while he was New
Hampshire's attorney general and continued under Souter.
   ``We felt strongly that the federal government had no right to
impose those rules on sovereign states. We didn't have a problem
defending the state,'' Rudman said. He added he still believes
``the federal government is guilty of unwarranted intrusion.''
   In the 1976 case, a federal judge ordered New Hampshire to abide
by the EEOC rule. The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, on which
Souter now sits, upheld the judge's ruling.
   Souter, as state attorney general, then asked the Supreme Court
to declare the federal regulation unconstitutional.
   The brief he signed said the rule requires states to ``become
color-conscious rather than colorblind'' and could lead to racial
quotas. ``Quotas are an impermissible end. And accordingly so too
should be the means to that end,'' it said.
   The brief also said the regulation violates the rights of each
worker to be free ``from having his or her own skin color
eyeballed, recorded and reported.''

<HEAD>Democrats Warn That GOP Attacks Will Hinder Budget Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are warning President
Bush and Republican leaders that fingerpointing over the budget
stalemate will only jeopardize efforts to forge a deficit-reduction
agreement in September.
   Serious budget bargaining is on hold until Congress returns from
its month-long August recess. Republicans promised on Wednesday to
spend the break telling the public that Democrats had dragged the
talks to a standstill by refusing to advance a proposal of their
own.
   ``We'll let the American people judge for themselves on this
issue,'' White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said, shortly after
Bush held a budget strategy session with 150 congressional
Republicans.
   ``I'll just explain to my people, objectively, that we produced
a plan pursuant to an agreement, we were ready to put it on the
table, but the Democrats didn't,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
   Democrats countered that with the two parties trying to develop
a schedule for reaching a deal in September, partisanship would not
help.
   ``If they launch a full-scale partisan attack, they're risking a
long-term agreement for a very short-term political gain,'' said
Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   ``This problem is much too serious to see who can make some
clever accusation,'' said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of
the Senate Finance Committee.
   The talks have barely budged during their 12 weeks, even as the
Oct. 1 start of the 1991 fiscal year has drawn closer.
   The budget deficit for 1991 is projected at $169 billion, not
including the cost of rescuing the nation's savings and loan
industry. The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law will impose
devastating spending cuts of more than $100 billion in October
unless a budget deal is reached.
   But the bargaining ground to a halt after an administration
proposal to save $54 billion was floated last week. Higher taxes on
beer and wine and a limit on the deductions allowed for state and
local income taxes were mentioned as revenue sources.
   Angry Republicans have demanded that Democrats produce a plan of
their own. Unless a plan is produced, Bush promised to veto
spending bills he considered too expensive, and leave the
Gramm-Rudman cuts intact.
   But Democrats have countered that with recess approaching, a
package announced now would simply draw criticism for a month and
prove of little value.
   ``The argument about laying down a plan right now frankly is
more of an argument that says, `We'd like to have Democrats bleed a
little bit because we bled,''' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee.
   Negotiators said that when bargaining resumes in September, they
may seek a secluded retreat where they can do their work
uninterrupted.
   Bentsen said a plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore is a
possibility. Participants said White House budget director Richard
Darman wants the talks to proceed at Camp David, the presidential
retreat in western Maryland. But Democrats fear Camp David would be
too small to accommodate staff aides.

<HEAD>Accord Reached on Access to Japanese Telecommunications Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new U.S.-Japanese agreement resolves a
contentious trade dispute over barriers that have blocked American
and other foreign companies from the lucrative Japanese
telecommunications market.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced the accord late
Wednesday, hailing it as ``an important step towards giving U.S.
firms in Japan access comparable to the access Japanese firms enjoy
in the United States.''
   The settlement ended four months of bargaining over U.S. demands
for greater access to the Japanese market.
   Negotiators had been holding marathon talks in Tokyo over the
past two weeks trying to meet a Wednesday deadline. Had the
discussions failed to resolve the dispute, the United States could
have retaliated by imposing higher tariffs on Japanese products.
   While the exact language of the agreement was still being
reviewed by both sides, U.S. officials expressed satisfaction that
their major demands had been met.
   Hills said the Japanese had agreed to remove barriers blocking
U.S. companies from offering telephone services, such as voice mail
and electronic banking.
   The agreement also removed barriers preventing the sale directly
to customers of a type of telephone device known as network channel
terminating equipment. This device allows signals from business
equipment such as computers to be transmitted over telephone lines.
   The potential Japanese market in the two areas was estimated to
be more than $3 billion annually. U.S. companies hope to gain a
significant portion of the market because of their wide lead in
many telecommunications fields.
   ``We are significantly ahead of the Japanese in experience and
efficiency in providing these services. Given the significant
lowering of bureaucratic obstacles, we are going to do pretty
well,'' said one U.S. trade official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Both sides were negotiating under the Aug. 1 deadline set last
March 30 for resolving the dispute.
   Without an agreement, Hills was authorized to begin a process
that could have resulted in economic retaliation against Japanese
products sold in this country equal to the amount of estimated lost
sales facing American firms.
   Telecommunications has been a major source of trade tension
between the United States and Japan. The 1988 U.S. trade act
requires an annual review of all trade agreements in this area and
allows for retaliation if the United States finds the Japanese are
not living up to prior agreements.
   Last year, the United States threatened to impose tariffs on
Japanese imports unless the Tokyo government changed regulations
affecting the use of cellular telephones and some radio services
offered by Motorola Inc.
   The agreement on telecommunications equipment is the latest in a
series of deals struck between the two nations in an effort to
lower trade tensions. Earlier this year, the Japanese agreed to
expand market access for U.S. and other foreign companies in the
areas of timber products, satellites and super computers.
   In addition, the two nations reached agreement on a
broad-ranging accord aimed at attacking structural barriers in both
countries that have been targeted as a primary reason for the $49
billion trade deficit the United States ran up with Japan in 1989.
That represented nearly half the total U.S. shortfall of $109.4
billion for the year.

<HEAD>Car-Crazy California Learns to Ride the Train</HEAD>

   Commuters in the land where the automobile
reigns supreme are making like veteran straphangers and taking Los
Angeles' new rail system to work. OK, not many are doing it, but
officials say it's a start.
   After an 18-day introductory period during which the ride was
free, the new 22-mile Blue Line began charging the $1.10 fare
Wednesday.
   Ridership plummeted by more half, to about 11,000, but Rapid
Transit District spokesman Ken Echard said that was anticipated.
   Many passengers said they had given up the workday drive for
good and adapting to the lifestyle of straphangers in cities with
established rail systems.
   Some clamped on stereo headphones. Others buried their heads in
newspapers, did paperwork or snoozed. Many remarked on the absence
of freeway driving tension.
   ``I feel so much less stress when I get to work and when I get
home,'' said Connie Wilcken, 40, of Long Beach. The two-car trains
leave her a few blocks from her job at a medical clinic near
downtown, and she walks the rest of the way.
   No one has said one train line will relieve the region's highway
congestion, but morning riders Wednesday rushed past motorists on
the Long Beach Freeway. A one-car spinout had jammed traffic by
6:30 a.m. on the downtown-bound lanes, which run almost parellel to
the Blue Line.
   The rail line linking downtown with Long Beach opened July 14,
the first light rail transit in Los Angeles County in nearly 30
years. The system is aimed at easing car-crazy Southern
California's dependence on automobiles.
   The line cost $877 million and is part of a 150-mile, $10
billion rail grid planned for completion next century. Three miles
of the Blue Line are unfinished.
   The 55-minute ride proved so popular the Los Angeles County
Transportation Commission, the system's operators, postponed the
fare until Wednesday. An estimated 670,000 riders took advantage of
the 18-day offer.
   Boardings Wednesday were down from the 33,000 riders who took
the trains for free the day before. Officials expect daily usage to
climb to 12,000 next year.
   Transit workers at the system's 22 stations showed riders how to
operate machines that dispense tickets, transfers and change.
   Ticket-buying is on the honor system; fare beaters face a
possible $250 fine starting this weekend. Sheriff's deputies are
responsible for security on the line, which passes some of the
area's toughest gang territory.
   Passengers Wednesday dutifully held aloft their rectangular
ducats, like a class showing ``all present.''
   ``There shouldn't be any confusion,'' said Sheriff's Sgt. Lynne
Hughes at the Blue Line command center. ``For the next couple of
days, we are warning people.''
   Dawn Lacy of Anaheim and Jeni Buys of Mission Viejo, 19-year-old
students at the downtown Fashion Institute of Design and
Merchandising, said each saves about $190 a month by taking the
Blue Line.
   Before, they paid $12 for a round trip on Amtrak between Anaheim
and Union Station in Los Angeles. Now they drive to Long Beach,
park for free and buy a fare and transfer for a total of $1.35 per
person.
   ``Now I can tell my kids I did all this to get to school,'' said
Miss Buys.
   ``It's also been pretty reliable,'' said Miss Lacy. ``The train
comes by every 10 or 15 minutes.''
   Five accidents have been reported since the system opened, the
most serious on Monday when a teen-ager playing ``chicken'' lost
some of his toes.
   Hughes said in the five days ending Wendesday deputies made 20
arrests, mostly for vandalism and trespassing. There have been no
reports of violent crime.

   Neil Bush, accused of conflict of interest as
a savings and loan director, continues to dispute key points raised
by regulators in the case.
   The president's son was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association, a Denver-based thrift that failed in December
1988 at a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   In two documents released Wednesday by the Office of Thrift
Supervision, Bush and the regulators said they disagreed on a
number of significant points. The key point of contention is
whether Bush adequately disclosed to Silverado his business
relationships with Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters, two big
borrowers from the thrift.
   On Monday, the OTS released a document setting out the areas of
agreement between Bush and the regulators.
   All of the documents contain information that was previously
made public. They have been submitted to Administrative Law Judge
Daniel J. Davidson as part of the proceeding in the Bush case.
   Bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on Sept. 25
in Denver before Davidson, who will then make a recommendation to
OTS Director Timothy Ryan.
   In addition to the OTS case, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against Bush and other
Silverado directors.
   Bush's attorneys and the OTS each submitted one of the new
documents, called statements of contested facts. In his seven-page
paper, Bush contended that before he joined the Silverado board, he
disclosed his relationships with Good and Walters to former
Silverado chairman Michael Wise, other Silverado managers, the
board of directors and the thrift's attorneys.
   Good and Walters invested millions of dollars in Bush's oil
partnership, JNB Exploration Co., which drilled several dry holes
in Wyoming over two years and failed to become profitable.
   As a director of Silverado, Bush voted to approve some loans to
Good and Walters but did not vote on others.
   Bush also asserted in his document that he made no agreement to
abstain from votes involving loans to Good or Walters.
   In its nine-page submission, the OTS said ``there is no
evidence'' that a letter prepared by Wise about Bush's business
dealings with the two men was actually sent. The letter was
addressed to Silverado's preferred shareholders and was accompanied
by a cover memo to the directors, the OTS noted.
   The document alleged that Bush breached his duty to Silverado
shareholders when he voted to approve certain loans to Good and
Walters. Five of those loans resulted in a combined loss to
Silverado of at least $46 million, the OTS said.
   ``Generally accepted standards of prudent operation require the
disclosure of a thrift director's relationships with major
customers of the institution when further transactions are under
consideration,'' the agency said.

<HEAD>NTSB Urges Inspections After Finding No Bomb in Plane Explosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal board is calling for immediate
inspection of all Boeing 737s and several other airliners after
investigators determined that a mechanical fault, not a bomb,
likely destroyed a Philippine jet.
   Philippine authorities had said they suspected a bomb in the May
11 explosion and fire that killed eight people as the Philippines
Air Lines 737 was taxiing for takeoff on a domestic flight from
Manila.
   But the National Transportation Safety Board, which has assisted
in the Philippine government's inquiry, said Wednesday that
investigators found evidence of a possibly defective switch inside
the jetliner's center fuel tank and damaged wiring leading to the
switch.
   ``The investigation has found no evidence of a bomb, an
incendiary device or sabotage,'' NTSB Chairman James Kolstad said
in a letter to Federal Aviation Administration chief James Busey.
   The safety board has no power to issue orders for emergency
inspections of airliners, but the FAA does. Foreign airlines
generally follow FAA orders involving U.S.-built planes.
   The four-member board urged Busey to issue ``airworthiness
directives'' calling for inspection of float switch wiring in all
Boeing 737s and in all planes among other airliner types where
modifications have been made that might have caused damage to wires
leading to switches in the fuel tanks.
   Boeing Co. documents show that nearly 1,900 of its 737s are in
use worldwide. The number of other airliners that could be affected
was not immediately clear.
   The FAA already has advised Philippine Air Lines to inspect its
remaining two 737s for possible wiring damage during installation
of lights that shine on each plane's tail to illuminate its logo,
Kolstad said. But he said there is evidence of other wire damage in
the plane that may have occurred ``at the factory.''
   ``The safety board does not believe that this action is adequate
because it does not address the problem of faulty float switches,''
Kolstad added.
   Although Kolstad said investigators have not determined exactly
what triggered the explosion, he said:
   ``It is possible that the combination of a faulty float switch
and damaged wires providing a continuous power supply to the float
switch may have caused an electrical arc or overheating of the
switch, leading to the ignition of the center fuel tank vapor.''
   The board chairman said laboratory examination of the switch
from the Philippine jet indicated defects that show ``it is
possible that the switch did not pass inspection when originally
assembled.''
   The manufacturer, Revere Aerospace, changed its method of
building the switches three years ago, but all 850 switches stocked
by Boeing were made before the change, Kolstad said in the letter.
   The board questioned Boeing's procedures for inspecting the
switches and said a testing technique should be developed that
would ensure that the switches ``are free from defect that could
cause an explosion or fire.''
   Boeing spokesman Tom Cole said the airplane manufacturer has
been participating in the investigation. He said it probably
already has sent out a service letter to other 737 users on
implications of the Philippine explosion.
   Cole said, however, he knew of no recommendations Boeing had
made for inspections or alterations.
   ``We are cooperating fully in the investigation, and we are
advising our customers of whatever we learn,'' he said.
   Safety board member Jim Burnett, in a comment attached to
Kolstad's letter, said he preferred an even broader inspection
affecting any airliner with a Revere Aerospace switch of the type
used in the Philippine jet.
   Burnett also called for an order that all such switches be
tested and replaced if found defective.

<HEAD>Business and Civil Rights Lobbyists Clash as Job Bias Vote Nears</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Vote scheduled for afternoon EDT, exact time uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business and civil rights forces vied in
last-minute lobbying as the House neared a vote on legislation
designed to combat job discrimination but which critics claim will
create hiring quotas.
   ``There has been a mounting lobbying effort,'' Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, R-Ill., said Wednesday night. ``Anybody with any interest at
all in this has been on the (Capitol) Hill _ the employer groups,
the civil rights community.''
   The House planned to vote this afternoon on the bill, which is
similar to legislation already approved by the Senate.
   It would effectively overturn five Supreme Court decisions last
year on job discrimination and was advancing in defiance of
administration threats of a presidential veto.
   Lawmakers expected the major showdown to come over an amendment
sponsored by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., that would eliminate a
provision that critics say would lead to hiring quotas and cap
court damages at $100,000.
   The administration and business groups have been pushing for the
amendment, while civil rights forces say it would wreck the bill.
   Major provisions of the bill range from a ban on racial
harassment in the workplace to barriers against reopening
court-approved fair-hiring agreements.
   The most controversy centers on provisions that would make it
easier to win hiring discrimination cases by showing statistical
evidence of bias.
   The administration says those features are so skewed against
employers that companies would adopt hiring quotas out of fear that
they otherwise would be bombarded with discrimination suits.
   This week brought more intense debate over the unlimited damages
that could be awarded to victims of intentional discrimination
under the bill.
   The LaFalce plan provided for a cap on damages of $100,000 for
each complaint. But they would be awarded only if no back pay was
ordered as a result of the complaint.
   Administration officials and other critics said a cap was one of
the features needed to prevent the bill from becoming ``a lawyers'
bonanza.''
   ``It will revitalize the Trial Lawyers Association and terrorize
employers into hiring by the numbers,'' Hyde said of the bill as
written.
   But sponsors said it would be unfair to women, religious
minorities and the disabled because unlimited damages already are
allowed for racial and ethnic discrimination.
   ``It would say to the world that America considers women
second-class citizens, not deserving of the same rights as blacks
and Hispanics,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.
   Lobbyists from both sides crisscrossed Capitol Hill throughout
the week as the House vote neared. Businesses flew in scores of
executives on Tuesday to meet with home-state congressmen and urge
a vote against the bill or at least in favor of amendments to
temper its provisions.
   The executives set up an informal headquarters and clearinghouse
for information at the Capitol Hill Club, adjacent to Republican
National Committee headquarters, said lobbyists who asked not to be
identified.
   Spearheading the lobbying on the other side was the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, whose member organizations range from
major unions to the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   Conference representatives held several bargaining sessions with
administration officials in an effort to reach compromise on the
issue after President Bush said he wanted to sign a bill to fight
job discrimination but not one that would lead to hiring quotas.
   But the two sides have not been able to reach an accord.
   A business umbrella group called the Fair Employment Coalition
has been coordinating lobbying against the provisions it contends
would bring on hiring quotas and allow excessive damages. Its
members are senior human resources vice presidents of 140 major
corporations.

<HEAD>House OKs Bill to Revamp Federal Housing Programs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has approved $28 billion for a
series of revamped housing programs by an overwhelming vote that
could make moot a presidential veto threat.
   The vote Wednesday was 378-43.
   The bill includes most of the Bush administration's initiative
for encouraging low-income housing tenants to purchase their homes,
as well as provisions sought by congressional housing advocates to
offer rental assistance, to help first-time home buyers and to
encourage construction of new rental housing.
   House Republicans joined Democrats in supporting the bill, but
key Republicans said they were doing so in hopes the bill would be
changed when it goes to House and Senate conferees to work out
differences in the two chambers' versions.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, ranking Republican on the Banking,
Finance and Urban Affairs Committee, said President Bush and Jack
Kemp, the secretary of housing and urban development, got 90
percent of their proposal to encourage public housing residents to
purchase their homes in some cases.
   The Senate has already approved a more modest housing bill after
reaching agreement with the Bush administration on key provisions.
   The White House threatened a veto because the House version
disregards the administration's demand for changes in the Federal
Housing Administration, including a requirement for a larger down
payment on FHA-backed home mortgages.
   The Senate version includes the higher down payment requirements.

<HEAD>Six Drown as Cargo Ship Buckles in Hurricane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crew of a cargo ship broken by 30-foot waves
kicked up by Hurricane Bertha abandoned ship in churning, chilly
seas because the vessel's lifeboats were too shabby to use, the
Coast Guard said today.
   Six crew members of the freighter Corazon drowned after the
ship's keel snapped about 350 miles off Cape Cod. Twenty-one others
were rescued by commercial ships providing lifeboats and rafts, the
Coast Guard said.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan said the Corazon's own
lifeboats were ``unserviceable.''
   The Coast Guard is investigating the ship's lifeboats, said
Quartermaster 1st Class Matthew Giltner.
   The crew abandoned the 593-foot Maltese-registered freighter in
90 mph winds early Wednesday, about 11 hours after reporting the
ship was breaking up.
   Soviet, Hong Kong and Norwegian merchant ships steamed to the
stricken vessel as U.S. military aircraft coordinated the rescue
effort from above.
   ``We have accounted for everybody: 20 in good condition, one
alive but injured, six deceased,'' Milligan said. Three bodies were
recovered.
   The search for the other victims, all seen dead in the water,
was halted late Wedneseday because of rough seas and bad weather.
   The hurricane, which was blamed for a Florida swimmer's death
Tuesday, moved northeast today and weakened slightly after injuring
six people in Nova Scotia with high seas on Wednesday.
   The Corazon was carrying about 25,000 tons of cement from Greece
to New York, and the load probably contributed to its damage, said
Coast Guard Lt. Rodney Gadsden.
   Rescue efforts did not go easily. At one point in the morning,
the Soviet trawler Vympel snared a life raft carrying 12 crew
members with its screw propeller and several people were dumped
into the water.
   One survivor was pulled from the water nearly 12 hours after
abandoning ship. He was in good condition, said Petty Officer Gail
Williams.
   The nature of the hurt sailor's injuries was not immediately
known, officials said.
   The survivors were put aboard a Soviet merchant ship that was
headed for Portland, Maine, and could arrive by Friday.
   After the crew abandoned ship, the Corazon's bow was submerged
but its stern stood clear of the water, the Coast Guard said.
   The crew included Greek, Filipino, Polish and Maldivian sailors,
said Charles Aitcheson, president of Asca Marine Inc., the ship's
New York agent.
   The Corazon was built in Japan in 1972 and previously was
operated under the Philippine flag as the Dona Corazon II,
Aitcheson said.
   He said the owner is Good Faith Shipping of Piraeus, Greece.

   Health officials are employing
psychological warfare in a nearly decade-long battle against
thousands of noisy starlings that descend in dense flocks each
summer in certain elm-lined neighborhoods.
   The birds keep people awake, coat cars in messy droppings and
make Bob Mathis' life miserable each summer.
   Mathis, the village's environmental health supervisor, has tried
everything over the years from wind machines to huge balloons
painted with ``terror eyes'' to resemble owls.
   He had limited success until he hit on a promising combination
two or three years ago of high-intensity search lights and a taped
starling distress call that fills the evening air with screeching
to scare away the birds.
   ``We use a physical assault and psychological warfare,'' he
said. ``The lights unsettle their environment and the starling
distress call is an eerie sound, like a bird being strangled.''
   For seven years or more in the warmer months, the birds in
flocks of 3,000 to 5,000 seem to favor the cathedral-arch canopies
of elms on two usually quiet blocks in this Chicago suburb.
   The birds feast on beetles and caterpillars by day and head for
the trees at dusk for their evening shut-eye.
   Residents call the kids inside and park their cars down the
block, away from the splatter of bird droppings.
   ``It's a real mess here,'' one resident, Ken Radnitzer, said
Wednesday night, during one of Mathis' regular trips to the
neighborhood with the lights and distress call.
   ``It's a health hazard,'' said another, Kathleen Dawson. ``The
droppings get so bad that if you're out in the evening and your kid
is in bare feet you're forever running after him. Or in the back
yard, the droppings get on the toys.''
   John Jones said he doesn't need an alarm clock in the summer.
   ``At 4, 5, 6 o'clock in the morning the birds start up,'' he
said. ``They'll take care of waking you up.''
   When the village first went after the birds, it suspended
balloons 6 feet around above trees. The balloons had reflective
``terror eyes'' stuck on, but the balloons blew away in wind storms
and the approach was abandoned.
   Wind machines were tried with little success. Ultimately,
Mathis, who doesn't want to kill the birds or tamper with the
trees, settled on the lights and taped screeches.
   The method chases the birds off the blocks under siege, but they
come back eventually or bother some other block. But Mathis isn't
ready to give up on the technique.
   ``You just have to be persistent,'' he said. ``It's a question
of who can last the longest and the Health Department so far is
keeping up with the birds.''
   Starlings, native to Europe, were first released in New York's
Central Park in 1890. Two earlier attempts to introduce the birds
to North America failed, but this one succeeded in a big way.
   Like the settlers before them, the starlings headed west and
reached the Pacific in 60 years. Now they occupy nearly every nook
and cranny of North America, numbering an estimated 200 million.

<HEAD>Plan Calls For Three Mile Island Customers To Pay Until 2014</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Mile Island's Unit 2 nuclear reactor
only functioned for four months, but customers would be paying for
the now-crippled unit until the year 2014 under a plan proposed by
the plant's owners.
   In a report filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the
owners' representative said they intended to seek permission from
state utility regulators to charge ratepayers $195.6 million to
dispose of Unit 2. The money would be collected over the next 24
years.
   The unit operated only about four months before it was
permanently disabled in the nation's worst commercial nuclear
accident on March 31, 1979. Its twin, Unit 1, was unharmed and was
given permission to resume operations in 1985. The owners hope to
operate the healthy unit until 2014.
   The $195.6 million is about $70 million more than the usual cost
of decommissioning a comparable reactor that did not suffer an
accident.
   It is standard practice for utilities to ask ratepayers to fund
decommissioning, the formal term for mothballing or dismantling a
plant at the end of its energy-producing life.
   But Three Mile Island poses ``a more difficult question,''
Pennsylvania Consumer Advocate Irwin Popowsky said.

<TEXT>
   If you lose your job because the federal
government wants to protect the spotted owl or cut defense
spending, does the government have any special obligation to you?
   That is the question generating increasing debate on Capitol
Hill. With the fall election approaching, supporters of clean air,
protected forests and reduced defense spending are displaying a
heightened awareness that their actions have an economic impact.
   Lawmakers debated legislation Wednesday that is designed to
provide extra support to loggers who lose their jobs because of
protection of the spotted owl, soldiers and defense factory workers
victimized by defense cuts, and coal miners laid off because of
tougher air pollution laws and a corresponding decline in coal
burning.
   The five-year, $5 billion program is the brainchild of Reps.
Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., and Pete Stark, D-Calif., whose districts
are among the scores that could be heavily impacted by cuts in
defense spending. Not surprisingly, Democrats from timber and coal
mining states also signed on.
   The Downey-Stark proposal would provide extra unemployment and
health benefits to about 200,000 workers _ far fewer, Downey noted,
than the number expected to be displaced.

   The National Bank of Washington has been
placed under federal conservatorship.
   NBW on Wednesday became the second financial institution in the
Washington region to be seized in two days. On Tuesday, federal
officials announced the takeover by the Resolution Trust
Corporation of United Savings Bank in Vienna, Va.
   ``In order to keep the confidence in the bank's customers, and
keep the bank continuing to operate we took the action to appoint a
conservator,'' said Dean DeBuck, spokesman for the federal Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency.
   Earlier on Wednesday, the Washington Bancorp filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, officials said. At that time, indications were that NBW's
$1.6 billion assets would be liquidated, but federal officials only
have the power to take such action.
   ``We did not want the bankruptcy filing to make people run to
the bank to withdraw the money,'' said DeBuck, adding that all
deposits remain insured to the $100,000 limit and offices remain
open daily.

<HEAD>So Far, 1990 An Average Year for Earthquakes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So far, 1990 is just an average year for
earthquakes, although the Iranian quake in June was the deadliest
in 14 years.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said Wednesday the death toll in
Iran, estimated at 50,000 or more, is the highest since a 1976
quake in China killed more than 250,000 people.
   Overall, there were 34 significant quakes in the first six
months of 1990. That would be close to normal, since there are, on
average, 60 significant quakes in a typical year, the agency said.
   A significant quake is defined as one reaching 6.5 or higher on
the Richter scale or a lesser temblor causing significant
casualties or damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released in an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Every increase of one whole number, say from 5.5 to 6.5,
indicates a tenfold increase in ground motion.
   The quake that struck Iran measured 7.7 on the scale, according
to Waverly Person, chief of the agency's National Earthquake
Information Service in Golden, Colo.

   Tank-led Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait before dawn
Thursday, seizing the ruler's palace and other government
buildings, Kuwaiti officials reported.,
   The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein said the
Kuwaiti government had been overthrown.
   The invasion comes nearly two weeks after Iraq massed troops on
Kuwait's border in a dispute over an oilfield and Kuwait's
violation of OPEC oil production quotas, which had kept down the
price of crude.
   ``The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!'' one Kuwaiti official
shouted in a telephone interview.
   ``They have seized all administrative buildings, including the
information ministry which houses the (state-run) radio and
television stations,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a
few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away before dawn.
   The invaders, whose forces far outnumber those of smaller
Kuwait, were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the brunt
of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran. The troops set up
roadblocks at major intersections in the capital.
   The invaders surrounded the palace of the ruler of Kuwait, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the official said. Residents in the
palace's vicinity said it was seized after two hours of heavy
artillery barrages.
   The whereabouts of the emir, whose family has ruled the
city-state for almost 250 years, was not immediately known.
   The bombardment of ports and airports was vicious, eyewitnesses
said.
   Thousands of residents attempted to flee south toward Saudi
Arabia in their cars. Kuwait's official radio broadcast a desperate
plea for help from other Arab nations.
   The Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington reported only that there were
many casualties in the fighting, which follows a flareup in a
protracted dispute over a border oil field, but gave no numbers
early Thursday.
   Residents said there were about 50 tanks around the emir's
palace and the neighboring U.S. Embassy. The embassy did no answer
its telephones.
   The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton and
Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, sources said.
   The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turned away.
   The Bush administration demanded immediate withdrawal of the
Iraqi forces and added that it was ``reviewing all options in its
response to the Iraqi aggression.''
   U.S. warships have been on ``short-term'' alert 600 miles
southeast of the Iraq-Kuwait border since July 24 because of the
tensions in the oil-rich Persian Gulf region, scene of heavy
fighting in the Iran-Iraq war.
   The White House said it had no reports of harm to Americans. The
United States has extensive business ties to Kuwait, and the U.S.
community in the nation _ slightly smaller than New Jersey _ is
sizeable, in the thousands.
   The White House denounced the incursion, issuing a statement
that said, ``The United States strongly condemns the Iraqi military
invasion of Kuwait ...
   ``We have conveyed this message to the Iraqi ambassador in
Washington and to the Iraqi government through our embassy in
Baghdad.
   ``We deplore this blatant use of military aggression in
violation of the U.N. charter.''
   In New York, U.N. officials said the Security Council was to
begin an emergency meeting early Thursday.
   Reaction was swift elsewhere. The British government said the
``armed incursion is clearly a grave threat to peace and stability
in the area and of immediate concern to the international community
as a whole.''
   The Iraqi action was expected to dominate talks between
President Bush and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when they meet
later Thursday in Aspen, Colo.
   Iraqi officials on Wednesday had abruptly walked out on talks in
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, complaining that the Kuwaiti representatives
were not negotiating seriously. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
had intervened beginning July 25 to set up the talks in a bid to
cool tensions between the two OPEC members.
   In Baghdad, Saddam's government announced Thursday that the
Kuwaiti government had been toppled.
   Kuwait radio went off the air briefly, but came back on
different wavelenghs with martial music and Kuwaiti patriotic songs.
   Saddam's ruling council issued a statement from Baghdad saying
an interim government had been established in Kuwait but the claim
could not be immediately and independently confirmed.
   ``Iraq has responded to the request from interim government of
free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it,'' the Iraqi statement
said.
   It said the troops _ no numbers were given _ were in Kuwait to
defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. There was no further
identification of the revolutionary government.
   Iraq warned too that any foreign troops trying to interfere with
its actions would be attacked.
   More than 60 percent of the country's 1.8 million residents are
foreigners.
   Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy
artillery in a failed attempt to repulse them, government officials
contacted by telephone earlier Thursday said.
   Iraqi, which is the size of California, has an estimated 1
million troops among its 17 million populace, compared to 20,300
members of the Kuwait armed forces.
   In Baghdad, the official radio interspersed martial music with
songs with slogans like, ``Greetings to the Revolution in Kuwait.''
   The invasion followed massive troop movements to the south on
Wednesday.
   In Kuwait early Thursday, the rattle of automatic guns sounded
and explosions in rapid succession shook local residents from their
sleep and the Kuwaiti Cabinet quickly assembled.
   Residents in downtown Kuwait reported formations of French-made
Mirage jet fighters of the Kuwaiti air force taking to the skies in
the direction of the border region.
   The streets were empty; some people on rooftops of their houses
reported hearing gunblasts growing in intensity and speed. Moments
later army tanks and armored personnel carriers were moving in the
direction of the Royal Palace, apparently to reinforce the guards.
   Kuwait is a former British protectorate that gained independence
in 1961. Its residents are among the wealthiest in the world
because of the country's vast oil reserves.
   In Tokyo, the dollar moved sharply higher along with oil prices
during morning trading Thursday on news of Iraq's invasion.

<TEXT>
   A father convicted of murdering his four children
by driving the family station wagon into a river drew a sentence of
life in prison from a judge who second-guessed his own handling of
the case.
   Lawrence DeLisle, 29, had claimed a leg cramp and a faulty
accelerator caused him to speed down a dead-end street and crash
through a barricade into the Detroit River a year ago.
   Circuit Judge Robert Colombo Jr. on Wednesday imposed the
mandatory sentence of life in prison on each of four murder counts
and one count of attempted murder. The terms will be served
concurrently.
   In imposing sentence, the judge said DeLisle intentionally drove
the car into the water but may not have been guilty of first-degree
murder and might have benefited had the trial been moved out of
town, away from heavy publicity.
   The judge had denied a defense request for a change of venue.
   Killed when the car sank in 27 feet of water were DeLisle's
children, Bryan, 8; Melissa, 4; Kathryn, 2, and Emily, 8 months.
Passing boaters rescued DeLisle and his wife, Suzanne. DeLisle was
convicted on June 21.
   ``A father's job is to protect his children, and I failed,'' he
told the jduge Wednesday. ``I panicked. I froze. That is my guilt,
not murder.''
   Prosecutors said DeLisle was bent on suicide to free himself of
family responsibilities. Witnesses testified he had complained his
family was a financial burden and several years ago left the house
with a candle burning by a leaky gas dryer in an alleged attempt to
wipe the family out.
   Mrs. DeLisle said the deaths were an accident, and she affirmed
her love for her husband.
   ``The police weren't there. I was,'' she said. ``I know that one
of the reasons I have made it this far is because my husband is
innocent. ... We will be together again.''
   Trial evidence proved DeLisle's act was premeditated, Colombo
said, but added, ``I don't know if the defendant is guilty of the
crimes of which he was convicted.''
   The jury could have convicted DeLisle of lesser charges
including second-degree murder, negligent homicide or involuntary
manslaughter.
   The judge also said the jury ``may have been subconsciously
influenced by what they already knew about the case through the
media.''
   Defense attorney Frank Eaman said he will seek a new trial

   Atlanta's Roman Catholic archbishop resigned last
month for fear a two-year relationship with a woman half his age
would become public, his temporary successor says.
   Eugene A. Marino, the nation's first black archbishop, had cited
health reasons and the need for ``spiritual renewal, psychological
therapy and medical supervision'' when he resigned July 10. He had
relinquished his duties in May because of stress and a near heart
attack.
   But on Wednesday, Bishop James P. Lyke said Marino asked him to
confirm the relationship with a 26-year-old lay minister after a
report earlier in the day by WAGA-TV.
   The TV station said that Marino, 56, was supporting Vicki R.
Long with $1,500-a-month payments and helping her buy a house. It
said a flight insurance policy taken by Marino for a trip to Mexico
listed Ms. Long as his beneficiary.
   Neither the TV station nor Lyke said if the relationship was
sexual.
   Lyke said the archbishop resigned ``because I think he probably
realized that this was not going to be something that was going to
stay out of the public eye. My sense is that he concluded that he
could not function with that kind of possible disclosure over his
head.''
   Ms. Long, who filed a $2.3 million paternity suit in 1987
against a priest she alleged fathered her child, refused to comment
on the allegations involving Marino.
   Church officials refused to say where Marino could be located.
   The Rev. Peter Dora of the Atlanta Archdiocese said church
officials would hold a news conference this afternoon.
   Ms. Long charged that the Rev. Donal Keohane of Columbus, Ga.,
fathered her daughter, who was born in 1986. The church is paying
child support but denies Keohane fathered the child. Blood tests
concluded he was not the father.
   Church faithful in Atlanta reacted with disbelief.
   ``This is a bombshell an I hate very much to hear this story,''
said Hugh Spalding Jr.
   Katherine Woodyard, former director of the archdiocesan
Commission for Black Catholic Concern, said, ``As far as I know
he's sick. That's what they told us and that's what I believe.''
   Marino was ordained in 1962 and consecrated as a bishop in 1974.
He had been the archbishop of Atlanta since May 1988, coming from
Washington, where he was auxiliary bishop to Cardinal James Hickey.
   The pope appointed Lyke, auxiliary bishop of Cleveland, to run
the archdiocese until a new archbishop is appointed. The
archdiocese covers 69 northern Georgia counties with more than
150,000 Roman Catholics.

<HEAD>Parents, Feminist Group Seek to Overturn Parental Consent Laws</HEAD>

   The parents of a young woman who died from a
back-alley abortion are joining forces with a national women's
rights group to overturn state laws requiring minors to get
parental consent for abortions.
   Karen and Bill Bell of Indianapolis appeared Wednesday with the
Feminist Majority at a news conference announcing the ``Becky Bell
Campaign,'' which the group plans to take to high schools and
college campuses around the country.
   The Bell's 17-year-old daughter, Becky, died in 1988 from a
massive infection after receiving an abortion from an unqualified
practitioner.
   The Bells said they had a good relationship with their daughter
and had openly discussed sex and birth control. They said that
although they had never talked about abortion with Becky, they
would have left the decision up to her. But her father said Becky
confided to a friend: ``I can't tell Mom and Dad, I love them too
much.''
   ``The parental consent law sounds wonderful,'' Mrs. Bell said.
``What parent wouldn't want to know? I would. I'd say, `My girl
will tell me because she tells me everything.' Becky told me every
single thing she did _ until she fell in love.''
   Becky's story is the subject of a half-hour video, ``Abortion
Denied: Shattering Young Women's Lives,'' that the Feminist
Majority plans to take to schools throughout the country.
   ``This is one of the toughest areas for us in public opinion.
this is one of the reasons we decided to launch this major
campaign,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority.
``A lot of people just knee-jerk think, `Well, sure parents should
be involved.' They do not realize what mandatory, intrusive,
compulsory laws do to hurt women and their families.''
   In June, the Supreme Court upheld laws in Ohio and Minnesota
requiring a minor to obtain parental consent for an abortion.
Fourteen states currently enforce such laws.
   Indiana allows minors to get a judge's permission to waive the
parental consent restrictions. But the Bells said their daughter
had heard that the only sitting judge in Indianapolis was opposed
to abortion and granted few waivers.
   In the video, several young women who sought judicial waivers
were interviewed. They described the process as intimidating.
``Everyone knows what you're sitting there for,'' said one young
woman. In some states it takes up to 22 days for a waiver to be
granted.
   The campaign hopes to recruit as many as 1 million young people
from college campuses and high schools to join ``Becky Bell
Brigades.''
   ``We will be asking young people to help us with voter
registration drives, with petition campaigns, with going
door-to-door,'' said Smeal. Oregon, Massachusetts and Texas have
been targeted as key states where parental consent legislation is
pending.
   The states that currently enforce parental consent or
notification laws are: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Ohio, Rhode
Island, South Carolina, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming.

   A woman described as the cool,
calculating mother figure of a cult run by her husband could draw a
life sentence for her part in the ritual slaying of a family of
five.
   Alice Lundgren, 39, was found guilty Wednesday of kidnapping,
complicity and conspiracy to commit aggravated murder. She was the
first to be convicted in the case.
   Eight people await trial, including her husband, Jeffrey
Lundgren, and their 19-year-old son, Damon.
   Defense attorney Joseph Gibson said he will appeal. No
sentencing date was set.
   Lundgren was defrocked in 1988 as a lay minister of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for
inappropriate conduct. He formed a splinter sect whose members
lived commune-style with the Lundgrens on a farm.
   Mrs. Lundgren was among 13 cult members arrested last January in
the 1989 shootings of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three
daughters.
   Their bodies were found buried under a barn at the farm in
Kirtland, about 30 miles from Cleveland. All five were bound with
duct tape, gagged and shot, then dumped in a common grave.
   Mrs. Lundgren testified she was not at the farm during the
killings and was told about the slayings afterward.
   But three of four cult members who have pleaded guilty in the
case testified Mrs. Lundgren had known her husband had targeted the
Averys for death as a spirit-cleansing ritual in hope of witnessing
the return of Christ.
   Prosecutors described Mrs. Lundgren as the even-headed mother
figure in the group.
   Cult member Deborah Olivarez testified Mrs. Lundgren portrayed
her husband to others as a prophet who must be obeyed. She
testified Mrs. Lundgren taught female cult members to be ``carnal,
sensual and devilish'' and helped plan the Avery slayings.
   Lundgren, 40, faces trial Aug. 13 on charges of aggravated
murder and kidnapping. If convicted, he could get the death penalty.

   After the free lunch is over, will the
sharks know it's time to go home?
   The $80,000 Columbia River-Pacific Ocean Shark Tournament,
featuring a top prize of $35,000, prompted a lawsuit Wednesday from
a surf shop manager who says it's too risky to lure the ocean
predators into areas frequented by beachgoers.
   Competitors plan to chum, or toss ground fish and blood into the
water, to attract sharks, said Ron Miller, a charter boat operator
and tournament organizer.
   ``Who will tell the sharks that have been lured in from many,
many miles away that it's time to go home now?'' Seaside resident
Susanna Hendrix wrote in a protest letter to various state agencies.
   Steve McKenzie, manager of the Cleanline Surf Shop in Seaside,
said in the lawsuit slated for a hearing today that the hunt, which
is expected to draw 200 charter boats this weekend, jeopardizes
public safety.
   ``The lifeguards say the possibility of a shark attack on the
beach in Seaside is very real,'' McKenzie said.
   Aside from the safety issue, McKenzie said the tournament off
Oregon's northern coast should be stopped because it is inhumane.
   ``The idea of attracting sharks by throwing animal blood into
the water and then pulling them on board, clubbing them to death,
holding them, weighing them and then throwing them in the landfill
_ that's offensive,'' he said. ``It is killing for the sake of
killing.''
   Miller of Long Beach, Wash., said the danger of shark attacks
was remote because the tournament will take place up to five miles
offshore.
   ``There are literally millions of sharks out there,'' Miller
said. ``As far as shark tournaments, they are held on the East
Coast all the time and there has never been any kind of injury
attributed to a tournament.
   ``If anything, this tournament will elevate the status of the
shark to a more prized food fish and a more prized sport fish,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Dollar Soars, Tokyo Stocks Plunge After Iraq Invades Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar soared against the Japanese yen today
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, while shares on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange plunged.
   The dollar ended the day at 148.90 yen, up 2.25 yen from
Wednesday's 146.65-yen close. It opened at 147.13 yen and ranged
between 146.50 yen and 149.00 yen.
   Currency dealers said news late in the morning that Iraqi troops
had crossed the border into Kuwait set off sharp dollar buying.
   ``The dollar was bought briskly and quickly when the news came''
of the Iraqi troop movement, said Masakazu Kimura, a dealer with
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   The dollar tends to rise in times of world unrest because it is
regarded as a safe haven.
   About $18.56 billion changed hands in spot trading, up from
Wednesday's $13.55 billion.
   The invasion came after negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait
collapsed Wednesday in their dispute over oil, borders and money.
   Bank of Tokyo trader Masafumi Koyama said fears of higher oil
prices and uncertainties over the Iraq-Kuwait dispute accelerated
the dollar buying in the afternoon.
   ``Investors generally tend to overreact to any news from the
Middle East, but now they are waiting to see the reaction from the
European and U.S. markets after we close,'' Koyama said. He said
the Iraq-Kuwait situation had reversed the dollar's recent
downtrend, in which the U.S. currency lost 4.1 yen in Tokyo between
Monday and Wednesday.
   ``The dollar will quickly surpass the 151-yen line if
participants remain uncertain about the situation,'' Koyama added.
   Strife in the Middle East also drove up bids for crude oil, as
Tokyo traders reported the marker price for North Sea oil, Brent
crude, was bid up to $21.30 a barrel, about 30 to 40 cents higher
than in New York late Wednesday. No sellers were reported, however.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost
592.81 points, or 1.92 percent, ending the day at 30,245.18. The
index, which lost 197.67 points on Wednesday, dropped more than 700
points by mid-afternoon as panicked participants dumped issues
after reports of the Iraqi action, traders said.
   Yoshio Ogawa, chief trader at Nikko Securities Co., said
arbitrage selling of spot issues to take profits from price gaps
between the spot and future markets, as well as the plunge in yen
and bond prices, prompted the index's afternoon dive.
   Although the Nikkei reduced its losses toward the end of the
afternoon session as participants calmed down and began picking up
underpriced issues, Ogawa said the Nikkei was likely to continue to
suffer from uncertainties linked to the dispute between the two
Middle East nations.
   Trading was thin with volume on the first section estimated at
400 million shares, down from Wednesday's 430 million.
   In bond dealing, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds closed at 7.615 percent, up from Wednesday's 7.480
percent close. Their price ended the day at 85.11 points, down from
85.72 points Wednesday.

   Almost every movie at the neighborhood theater
these days stars a white male, and women and blacks say they're
ready for a different picture show.
   Blacks and women gathered Wednesday at separate conclaves to
discuss how they are underemployed, underpaid and overlooked in the
film and TV industry.
   In a panel discussion launching the 15th convention of the
National Association of Black Journalists, Hollywood insiders said
blacks get meager jobs in front of and behind the camera.
   Earlier Wednesday, the Screen Actors Guild released a study
showing that actresses earn half as much as actors and that their
prominence in Hollywood has declined over the last three years.
   ``Feature films are the exclusive domain of men as this summer's
movies illustrate,'' said Timothy Blake, national chairwoman of
SAG's women's committee.
   She was referring to ``Die Hard 2: Die Harder,'' ``Dick Tracy,''
``Total Recall,'' ``Days of Thunder'' and other blockbusters.
   At the journalists' convention, panel moderator Barbara Rogers
said blacks purchase more than 25 percent of all movie tickets.
Eddie Murphy's films have grossed more than $1 billion, but blacks
have little say in key creative decisions within the industry, she
said.
   ``I feel sometimes very alone,'' said Dennis Johnson, who is
black and the vice president of original programs for cable's
Showtime and The Movie Channel. ``Our business has made a
regression.''
   Others called for blacks to take an active leadership role.
   ``We have to begin to give ourselves an economic base from which
our community can draw,'' said Keenan Ivory Wayans, producer and
star of the acclaimed TV series ``In Living Color.''
   Other panelists said black critics, TV viewers and moviegoers
need to support works produced by or geared to blacks.
   The SAG study found that men were given more than twice as many
roles as women in 1989 movies, and men received 65 percent of all
parts in television programs during the year.
   The statistics were presented by Meryl Streep to launch SAG's
first National Women's Conference. She called the report tragic and
stunning.
   If the Hollywood employment trend continues, Miss Streep said,
``by the year 2000, we will have 13 percent of roles ... and in 20
years we will be eliminated from the movies.''
   Miss Streep said a growing number of movie roles going to women
cast them as prostitutes, rape victims and needy companions to
domineering men. She said the perception that women don't go to
movies and therefore don't need films aimed at them is flawed.
   Miss Streep said women are staying home precisely because there
aren't films catering to their interests and tastes.
   Mike Medavoy, chairman of Tri-Star Pictures, said movie
companies are just trying to produce popular fare.
   ``I don't think the studios determine what people's tastes
are,'' he said. ``The tastes dictate what gets done.''
   Three years ago, according to the SAG report, actresses claimed
a third of all film roles. In 1989, they took 29 percent of all
movie parts. Also in 1989, 41 percent of all film roles were for
male supporting actors and female leading roles made up only 14
percent of the total.
   Jeffrey Katzenberg, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said
employment for women at Disney is fairer than the study suggests.
``We're trying as hard as we can,'' Katzenberg said. ``We're
putting them to work.''

<HEAD>McMartin Pre-School Criminal Case is Over, Civil Cases Remain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The book is closed on the criminal end of the
McMartin Pre-School molestation case, but the civil claims are just
beginning.
   A jury hearing Raymond Buckey's retrial on eight child
molestation charges deadlocked last week. On Wednesday, Superior
Court Judge Stanley Weisberg accepted a prosecution request to
close the case without a third trial.
   ``The case of the People vs. Raymond Buckey is hereby dismissed
and the defendant is discharged,'' Weisberg said. ``That completes
this case.''
   Buckey promptly announced he was filing a lawsuit in state court
alleging malicious prosecution, conspiracy, defamation and civil
rights violations. His mother filed a similar lawsuit in federal
court in January.
   ``My family has nothing left,'' Buckey said. ``Do we just walk
out of the criminal system and they're not even going to say
they're sorry?''
   Lawyer Scott Bernstein, who did not represent Buckey in the
criminal trial, said he will seek millions of dollars in
compensation for Buckey.
   Buckey, 32, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were
acquitted in January of 52 charges of molesting children at their
now-closed preschool in Manhattan Beach. But the jury deadlocked on
several other charges against him.
   That first trial took nearly three years and cost Los Angeles
County more than $13.5 million, making it the longest and costliest
criminal trial in U.S. history.
   Named as defendants in Buckey's lawsuit were the county,
Manhattan Beach, former District Attorney Robert Philibosian,
Children's Institute International and social worker Kee
MacFarlane, KABC-TV and television newsman Wayne Satz.
   Satz broke the story and was romantically linked with Ms.
MacFarlane, lead therapist at the institute where workers used
play-acting techniques and anatomically correct dolls to interview
children about alleged molestation.

   Iraq and Kuwait produce one-fifth of the
total oil produced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, and their oil accounts for an estimated 5 percent of
daily U.S. consumption.
   Iraq is one of the major producers of the 13-member oil cartel,
with a daily OPEC production quota of 3.14 million barrels. That
equal's Iran quota and is second only to Saudi Arabia's quota of
5.1 million barrels.
   Kuwait's quota is 1.5 million barrels per day out of an
estimated production capacity of 2.2 million to 2.5 million barrels
per day.
   The United States buys about 200,000 barrels of oil daily from
Kuwait and 500,000-600,000 barrels from Iraq.
   In the first six months of this year the United States imported
49.9 percent of its oil. It produced 7.3 million barrels a day, the
lowest level in 29 years according to the American Petroleum
Institute.
   In the first half of 1990, OPEC produced about 23.5 million
barrels of crude oil per day, according to the Nicosia-based
industry newsletter the Middle East Economic Survey. World
production outside the Soviet Union and its former satellites was
about 52 million barrels daily.
   Kuwait is the only OPEC member to have developed an integrated
international system covering both production and distribution of
oil. The latter is done through a network of gas stations in Europe
and elsewhere in partnership with leading oil companies.
   Kuwait's huge oil reserves are backed by one of the largest
financial reserves in the world.
   Kuwait has more than $100 billion in surplus petrodollars,
mostly invested in the United States, Britain, West Germany, France
and other industrialized countries.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union wants to launch
unmanned rockets from Florida under a policy awaiting President
Bush's approval.
   Bush is expected to act soon on guidelines, which would allow
foreign countries to send up rockets from the United States.
   The Soviets are interested in launching Proton rockets from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station, next to NASA's Kennedy Space Center.
   The center is much nearer the equator than the Soviets' launch
site, making it easier to put satellites into the most commonly
used orbit, above the equator.
   The Soviets won't make a formal request until the guidelines are
final, said William Wirin, executive vice president of Space
Commerce Corp., a Houston company that markets Soviet rockets
outside the Soviet Union.
   Space Commerce recently relayed an informal request to the
Spaceport Florida Authority, a state agency formed last year to
support U.S. commercial space ventures.
   American launch companies fear their businesses will be
jeopardized if American commercial payloads such as satellites are
allowed to ride on Soviet rockets.
   ``This is not something we consider our mission by any means,''
said Ed Ellegood, the spaceport authority's operations manager. He
said officials will not discuss the Soviet proposal until a formal
request is made.
   The Soviet Union also is considering launch sites in Australia
and Brazil.

<HEAD>Kuwait Small, Fabulously Rich, Envied by Neighbors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait is a small kingdom whose fabulous
riches have sometimes made it the envy of the much-larger neighbors
that surround it.
   Baghdad has long claimed that the 6,880-square-mile Kuwait is
part of Iraq, although Kuwait has been ruled by the Al-Sabah family
as an emirate since 1756.
   Kuwait's relatively free-wheeling newspapers are read throughout
the Arab world, and Kuwait has long been a major donor of economic
aid to poorer countries inside and outside the Arab world.
   Recently, pro-democracy activists mounted a campaign for
restoration of the country's parliament, which had been suspended
in 1986 after fierce attacks on the government by opposition
deputies.
   The emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, later introduced an
interim National Council with 50 elected members and 25 appointed,
charged with paving the way for restoration of a full parliament.
   Kuwait's oil tanker fleet was a frequent target of Iranian
attacks during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, and Iranian missiles
were sent into Kuwait at the height of the hostilities.
   Shiite Moslem terrorists, backed by Iran, launched repeated
attacks in Kuwait during the war, including the successful bombings
of the French and American embassies and an abortive attempt to
kill the emir.
   The Kuwaitis are an ancient seafaring people. But more than half
the population of 1.8 million are foreigners, mainly Arab,
including 300,000 Palestinians.
   Most Kuwaitis are Sunni Moslem, but 30 percent adhere to the
rival Shiite sect. Shiites of Iranian descent number nearly
150,000. The Al-Sabah clan has ruled Kuwait as an emirate since
they settled there in the 18th century after trekking from the
Arabian hinterland.
   Kuwait lives on its oil. Revenue reached $30 billion in 1983 but
has been declining since because of a drop in oil prices and
production curbs.
   Kuwait currently produces about 1.5 million barrels of oil a day
and has reserves of 89.7 billion barrels, 12.8 percent of world
reserves and enough to last for more than 250 years.
   Little grows in the desert climate, so the emirate has to import
nearly all its food.
   The Mongols, Arab caliphs and Ottomans were by turn overlords of
the bleak and largely unpopulated land until 1899, when the British
became the dominant power in the region. Kuwait gained its
independence in 1961.

   A judge who ruled Los Angeles County's Board
of Supervisors had illegally drawn its districts to keep Hispanics
from getting elected rejected as nonsensical a plan offered by the
board to solve the problem.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon on Wednesday called for a new
plan, raising the prospect of a radical shift in the county's
balance of power.
   Kenyon said the remedy offered by the board was a ``nonsensical
distortion of existing supervisorial districts, a calloused
interpretation of the Voting Rights Act, and is insensitive to the
needs of Hispanic and black residents.''
   The judge set a hearing for today to consider alternative plans
from civil rights groups and the U.S. Justice Department.
   Civil rights groups and the department had sued in 1988,
accusing the supervisors of deliberately spreading the Hispanic
population across several districts when they changed voting
boundaries after the 1980 census.
   Though Hispanics make up about 35 percent of the county's 8.7
million residents, the five-member board has not had an elected
Hispanic member in 115 years.
   On June 7, Kenyon ruled against the supervisors, concluding they
violated the Voting Rights Act.
   The board's conservatives responded by drafting a plan that
created a Hispanic majority in one liberal board member's district
while also preserving the board's conservative majority. It was
this plan Kenyon rejected Wednesday.
   The next redistricting plans, to be submitted by the American
Civil Liberties Union, the government and a Mexican-American group,
could greatly increase Hispanic political clout and overturn the
conservative majority.
   That could have profound implications for funding in such areas
as health and social services.
   Conservative Supervisor Mike Antonovich denounced the judge's
decision and said he will appeal.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Surge on Middle East Turmoil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar soared against the Japanese yen and
gained strongly against other key currencies in European trading
today after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Gold prices leaped more than
$8.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.90 yen, up 2.25 from
Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 150.25
yen.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6105 West German marks, up from 1.5920
   _1.3730 Swiss francs, up from 1.3555
   _5.3970 French francs, up from 5.3355
   _1.8170 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7935
   _1,178.75 Italian lire, up from 1,164.75
   _1.1533 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1530
   In London, one British pound cost $1.8395 late today, down from
Wednesday's late $1.8550.
   The dollar had dropped more than 4 yen in Tokyo trading between
Monday and Wednesday, but the Iraqi invasion reversed market
sentiment.
   ``The dollar was bought briskly and quickly'' following news of
the invasion, said Masakazu Kimura, a dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank.
   Bank of Tokyo trader Masafumi Koyama said fears of higher oil
prices and uncertainties over the Iraq-Kuwait dispute accelerated
the dollar buying in the afternoon.
   ``Investors generally tend to overreact to any news from the
Middle East, but now they are waiting to see the reaction from the
European and U.S. markets after we close,'' Koyama said.
   The dollar also finished in Europe at 147.20 yen, up from the
Tokyo close of 146.65 yen. That brought the dollar back to the
level at the start of Tokyo trading Wednesday morning.
   In London, gold was quoted at a late price of $382.60 bid per
ounce this morning, up from $374.30 a troy ounce late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, where markets were closed for a holiday on Wednesday,
gold was quoted at $382.00.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $7.93 an ounce on Thursday, to close at
$379.39.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid price of $4.95 a troy
ounce, from $4.85.

<TEXT>
   Two prairie pioneer clans are inviting one
and all to their first joint reunion, where activities include a
watermelon-seed spitting contest, men's hammer throw and women's
skillet toss.
   More than 600 descendants of frontier homesteaders William O.
Coe and John Henry Russell are expected to gather from Aug. 10-12
for the reunion celebrating family bonds that began before the turn
of the century.
   Offspring of the two men who established farms in Nebraska and
Kansas chose to celebrate in Orleans, a town of 1,109 about 10
miles from the state line.
   In 1872, Coe and his wife, Emily, were the first homesteaders in
Harlan County's Washington Township. They lived in a sod house not
far from Orleans.
   In 1887, Russell and his wife, Margaret, homesteaded near
Woodruff, Kan., south of Orleans across the state line.
   Third-generation Jerold Russell said his father married a Coe
and as a boy he had more than 70 first cousins. Tracing relations
through the years can get complicated, he said
   ``All I know is a whole bunch of Russells married a whole bunch
of Coes,'' said Virgil Russell.
   Tours of the original homesteads are planned along with a
watermelon-seed spitting contest and water-balloon toss. There also
will be sack races and a haystack scramble.
   A flea market, a ladies' skillet toss and men's hammer throw are
scheduled, along with a barbershop quartet concert and a street
dance featuring the Wright Boys, more Russell cousins.

   Medical evidence showing that a teen-ager
fatally shot in the back by police had his hands raised in
surrender when the officer opened fire prompted the state's top
prosecutor to reopen the case, lawyers said.
   Police said Phillip Pannell, 16, had a gun and was reaching for
it when Officer Gary Spath shot him in April. A discredited
coroner's report supported the story told by Spath and partner,
Officer Wayne Blanco.
   Attorney General Robert Del Tufo on Tuesday rejected the autopsy
findings of Bergen County Medical Examiner, Dr. Lawrence J. Denson
and ordered a new grand jury investigation.
   ``The errors included faulty forensic study and inaccurate
autopsy analysis, both of which led to an incorrect conclusion
concerning the possible actions of Mr. Pannell at the time he was
shot,'' Del Tufo said in a statement.
   The first grand jury to investigate the case deadlocked without
indicting either officer.
   Del Tufo declined to detail the nature of the mistakes, but a
former lawyer for the Pannell family and the attorney representing
Blanco said the state is studying whether the victim had his hands
raised when he was shot.
   An independent autopsy performed by Dr. Howard Adelman, who was
hired by the Pannell family, found that the boy's hands were held
high overhead, said former family lawyer Franklin Wilks.
   Joseph T. Afflito, who represents Blanco, he was told last week
that Del Tufo's office had new forensic evidence that ``suggested
the boy might have had his hands up.''
   The location of the bullet hole in Pannell's coat in relation to
his body wound indicated his hands were up and damage to his rib
cage and upper torso muscles supported that conclusion, Wilks said,
citing Adelman's findings.
   Afflito said state prosecutors offered Blanco a chance to give
new testimony this week. Blanco declined ``because he had already
told the truth,'' the lawyer said.
   Spath has been suspended with pay. Blanco has not been
disciplined.
   Attorney Robert Galantucci, who represents Spath, condemned Del
Tufo's call for a new investigation.
   ``They shouldn't be playing politics with the grand jury
system,'' he said.
   Del Tufo said Denson admitted his mistake. Denson and Adelman
could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
   The shooting sparked a night of racial unrest in this New York
City suburb and local black leaders praised Del Tufo's rejection of
the autopsy report.
   ``The truth has now come out,'' activists said in a statement
Wednesday. ``The new grand jury will learn about this new evidence
and we are confident Spath will be indicted.''
   Five organizations, including the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and the Rainbow Coalition, issued the
statement at a news conference.
   ``The attorney general's office has been given one more chance.
I urge them to make good use of it,'' said Raymond M. Brown, the
Pannell's current attorney.
   Pannell, of River Edge, was shot after running from police who
were responding to a call about a youth brandishing a gun. After
the shooting, police said they found in Pannell's clothing an
athletic starter pistol that had been modified to fire live
ammunition.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's powerful army
overran this small oil-rich kingdom before dawn today and tank-led
troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and other government
buildings, Kuwaiti officials said.
   Iraq said it had come to the aid of ``revolutionary youth in
Kuwait'' who had toppled the government and set up a new
administration.
   The Kuwaiti ruler, whose palace was bombed by Iraqi jet
fighters, reportedly fled to neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   Casualties in the blitz were reported heavy and the shelling
fierce, but no figures were immediately available.
   The invasion came hours after Iraq abruptly broke off talks on a
disputed border oil field. Iraq also was demanding billions of
dollars for oil Kuwait pumped out of the field and the writeoff of
billions in loans.
   ``The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!'' a Kuwaiti official
shouted in a telephone interview from Kuwait city just hours after
thousands of Iraqi troops and hundreds of tanks stormed across the
border 75 miles away.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Iraqi
forces ``seized all administrative buildings, including the
Information Ministry which houses the (state-run) radio and
television stations.''
   The Iraqi invasion was the first time in modern history that an
Arab nation has moved troops over the border of another Arab state
to take control.
   Saddam, Iraq's totalitarian leader, has long harbored ambitions
to lead the Arab world and has committed his country's vast oil
wealth to building an arsenal that could achieve that end.
   The palace of the country's ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, was seized after two hours of heavy artillery and jet
fighter attacks.
   Diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said the emir and his brother
fled to Saudi Arabia early today. The sources would not say how the
two got there. The Al-Sabah family has ruled Kuwait for nearly 250
years.
   Witnesses said the bombardment of ports and airports was
vicious. Thousands of residents attempted to flee south toward
Saudi Arabia in their cars.
   In Washington, the Bush administration condemned the invasion
and froze all Iraq property in the United States and other areas
under U.S. control. It also froze Kuwait property under U.S.
jurisdiction to keep Iraq from seizing it.
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council swiftly condemned the
invasion and demanded an unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
   Iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally
Kuwait two weeks ago, and six U.S. warships began conducting
exercises 600 miles to the southeast in the Persian Gulf on July 24.
   CNN reported without attribution that a battle group led by the
carrier USS Independence was en route to the Persian Gulf from the
Indian Ocean.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Siberia for talks with
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, asked the Soviet foreign minister to
immediately cease Soviet arms deliveries to Iraq. Baker then flew
to Mongolia, and U.S. officials said privately that he would cut
short his visit there.
   Iraqi troops set up roadblocks at major intersections in the
capital and on the main thoroughfare, Fahd Salem Street, where they
were seen forcing drivers out of their cars and ripping phones out
of the vehicles.
   Cars that did not stop were shot at.
   More than 60 percent of the country's 1.8 million residents are
foreigners.
   Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the Kuwaiti
capital a few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away.
   The Kuwaiti Embassy in Washington said casualties were high but
gave no numbers. Residents said about 50 tanks were around the
emir's palace and the neighboring U.S. Embassy. The embassy did no
answer its telephones.
   The White House said it had no reports of harm to the estimated
3,800 Americans in Kuwait.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is the latest
thrust for ambitious President Saddam Hussein.
   Saddam earlier this year threatened to destroy half of Israel
with internationally outlawed chemical weapons if Israel tried to
attack any Iraqi military facilities.
   Western nations are nervous about Iraq's military posturing.
   Police have arrested several people in Britain on charges they
were trying to smuggle nuclear-bomb triggers to Baghdad.
   Police in Britain and other European countries also intercepted
shipments that they said were parts of a gigantic gun capable of
firing chemical or nuclear shells into Israel, 250 miles west of
the Iraqi border.
   Seeking to don the Arab nationalist mantle of the late Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nasser, Saddam has acquired a reputation for
ruthlessness.
   Obsessed about security, he ordered the March 15 execution of
Iranian-born, London-based journalist Farzad Bazoft, who had tried
to gather information about a huge explosion at a
military-industrial complex.
   Iraq has the second-largest known oil reserves in the world
after Saudi Arabia _ more than 100 billion barrels.
   Using oil revenue and his absolute power, Saddam initiated
ambitious social, educational and economic development programs in
the 1970s.
   His eight-year war with Iran left him with the Arab world's most
formidable and battle-trained army, but his nation was also saddled
with about $70 billion in war debts _ of which $10 billion to $20
billion was owed to Kuwait. Saddam had demanded that Kuwait write
off that debt.
   Saddam launched an economic reconstruction drive after the
August 1988 cease-fire with Iran but was constantly strapped for
cash.
   He turned his attention to Kuwait, whose roaring oil production
was helping glut the market and drive prices down, cutting Saddam's
precious revenues.
   Iraq claimed Kuwait was stealing oil from a border oil field and
demanded Kuwait's Bubiyan Island, which is opposite Iraq's only
outlets to the sea.
   Baghdad has even claimed for years that Kuwait is part of Iraq.
   A majority of Iraq's 16 million people are Shiite Moslems, the
same branch of Islam as most Iranians who the Iraqis were at war
with between 1980 and 1988. But Iraq is ruled by Sunni Moslems.
   There are small Christian communities and an enclave in the
north where most of the country's rebellious 3.5 million Kurds live.
   Captured by Britain in 1916, Iraq became independent in 1932. A
military coup in 1958 ended the monarchy. Saddam came to power in
1979 and gradually tightened the grip of his ruling Baath Socialist
Party.

   The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton and
Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, sources said.
   Swiss charge d'affaires Franco Bessoni said on French radio that
the palace was taken after bombardment by Iraqi MiG jet fighters.
   ``You can see black smoke over there .... No one dares to go
out. You can hear gunfire. The entire foreign community is staying
indoors,'' he said.
   ``It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time, Kathy
McGregor, a Canadian, said by telephone at about midday. She said
she could still hear artillery fire.
   The air space over Kuwait was closed, with airliners turned
away. Iraq also sealed its own borders and airspace.
   Iraq said in a statement that it had ``responded to the request
from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate
with it.''
   It said its troops _ no numbers were given _ were in Kuwait to
defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people. There was no further
identification of the revolutionary government.
   Saddam's ruling council also warned that any foreign troops
trying to interfere with its actions would be attacked.
   Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy
artillery in their failed attempt to repulse them, Kuwaiti
officials said earlier.
   The invaders were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the
brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran. Iraq has an
estimated 1 million troops _ including reservists _ among its 16
million people, compared to 20,300 troops in Kuwait.
   Iraqi radio said 15 army divisions were being recalled and
ordered all men born between 1960 and 1966 to report to the army
within three days.
   Today's fighting quickly sent oil prices surging in
international markets. The price of North Sea Brent crude for
September delivery was quoted early today at $22.30 a barrel
against Wednesday's London close of $20.40.
   Iraq, the world's second-largest oil producer, had demanded
higher oil prices at last month's OPEC oil cartel meeting in Geneva.
   Saddam had threatened military action against Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates for exceeding their cartel production quotas
and driving crude prices down. OPEC agreed to cut output to boost
prices.
   The invasion came a day after talks between Kuwait and Iraq
collapsed in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia. Kuwait had apparently refused to
bend to Iraqi demands.
   The crisis began July 17 when Saddam accused Kuwait of trying to
wreck the debt-ridden Iraqi economy with oil overproduction and
began massing troops on Kuwait's border. He also accused Kuwait of
stealing $2.4 billion in oil drilled from the border oil field,
Rumailah.
   Iraq also demanded the Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan, which is
opposite Iraq's only outlets to the Persian Gulf.
   Iraq, which reportedly massed about 100,000 troops at the border
on Wednesday, has been engaged in a major defense buildup since
Saddam came to power in 1979.
   But the Iran-Iraq war left it with a foreign debt of about $70
billion. Iraq borrowed $10 billion to $20 billion from Kuwait wants
that debt forgiven.
   In Kuwait early today, the rattle of automatic guns sounded and
explosions in rapid succession shook residents from their sleep and
the Kuwaiti Cabinet quickly assembled.
   The Cabinet was holed up at the headquarters of the Supreme
Defense Council with telephone and telex links cut off, said
official sources.
   Kuwaiti radio briefly stopped broadcasting, then went back on
the air on a different wavelength. A speaker believed to be Crown
Prince and Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah appealed
for Arab support.
   ``Oh Arabs, Kuwait's blood and honor is being violated, rush to
its rescue ... the children, the women, the old men of Kuwait are
calling on you,'' the speaker said.
   Kuwait, nearly the size of New Jersey, is a former British
protectorate that gained independence in 1961. Its residents are
among the wealthiest in the world because of the country's vast oil
reserves.

   Five organizations, including the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and the Rainbow Coalition, issued the
statement at a news conference.
   ``The attorney general's office has been given one more chance.
I urge them to make good use of it,'' said Raymond M. Brown, the
Pannell's current attorney.
   Pannell, of River Edge, was shot after running from police who
were responding to a call about a youth brandishing a gun. After
the shooting, police said they found in Pannell's clothing an
athletic starter pistol that had been modified to fire live
ammunition.

<TEXT>
   Hotel executives traded beepers and
briefcases for blue jeans, gloves and orange safety vests before
sweeping the streets of San Francisco as part of a civic drive to
spruce up the city.
   More than 20 Hyatt executive volunteers got down and dirty
Wednesday in the attack on some of the 41,000 tons of curbside
garbage that piles up each year.
   ``It's not glamorous, but it's kind of fun,'' said Greg
Cornwell, a human resources director for the Park Hyatt.
   The managers and executives from the hotel chain are part of a
drive known as Beautification and Urban Design, or BUD.
   ``It's really not that bad,'' said employment manager Stephnie
Flores, 24, who admitted not everyone wanted to volunteer. ``You
have gloves on and they give you brooms with really long handles so
you're not getting right down into the garbage.''
   Before beginning the dirty work, the group sipped tea, drank
coffee from three silver urns, and ate muffins and sweet rolls.
   ``I believe in the community and I think this could be the
cleanest city in the world,'' said Abdul Suleman, a Hyatt regional
vice president working after a 27-hour flight from Pakistan.
   ``I'm tired and to tell you the truth I don't think I'm going to
be out here every Wednesday,'' said Suleman. ``But if this is
successful we want to continue the program next year with all
employees.''
   Public Works chief Richard Evans said his agency needs help from
civic leaders and residents because his staff can't keep up with
the garbage.
   ``We've gone from cleaning up 10,000 tons of garbage in 1976 to
41,000 tons last year. We need help,'' he said.

   Communist rebels released an
American Peace Corps volunteer today after holding him for 50 days
on the central Philippine island of Negros, a provincial governor
said.
   Earlier in the day, the New People's Army freed a Japanese aid
worker who had been held since May 29.
   Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, Wyo., was handed over to a Red
Cross team in a rural area more than 25 miles east of Bacolod, said
Daniel Lacson, governor of Negros Occidental province.
   The Red Cross was to turn Swanson over to a ``freedom
committee'' of local lawyers, officials and clerics who negotiated
his release.
   Lacson said he had been notified of Swanson's release by radio.
A large group of journalists accompanied the committee to the
release point, but were unable to report back because of primitive
communications.
   In Manila, the U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said he welcomed
Swanson's release and thanked efforts of Lacson and others who
helped negotiate the volunteer's release. ``The Embassy is releived
that he is safe, unharmed, and apparently in good health,'' the
embassy said in a statement.
   Swanson was abducted June 13 from his home in the Negros
mountain village of Patag, about 320 miles southeast of Manila.
   The United States suspended all Peace Corps operations in the
Philippines on June 27 and sent volunteers home because of alleged
reports that the rebels planned to target them.
   U.S. officials said they were unaware of Swanson's kidnapping
when the order was issued and learned of it June 30 when they tried
to contact him.
   Swanson's Filipino wife said rebels had warned her not to report
the abduction.
   Earlier today, the rebels freed Fumio Mizuno, 36, of the
Organization of Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement.
Mizuno appeared in good health although he complained of fatigue.
   The New People's Army, the military wing of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines, has been waging a 21-year
insurgency to establish a Marxist state.

   Two police officers were sentenced to up to 10
years in prison after being convicted of stopping a teen-ager's car
and robbing him of $85.
   Officers Nathaniel Bell, 35, and Douglas Hankins, 32, called
Nathaniel Marshall a liar before they were sentenced Tuesday on
armed robbery charges.
   ``I've been an officer since June 1977 and this is the job I
love,'' Bell told Recorder's Court Judge James Chylinski. ``I did
not _ or my partner, either _ ever come into contact with Mr.
Marshall.''
   Marshall ``has been lying since day one,'' added Hankins, a
12-year veteran named in 1988 as his section's Officer of the Year
by the Detroit Police Officers Association.
   Marshall, 18, testified that Bell and Hankins stopped his car in
February 1989 on Detroit's northwest side. The plainclothes
officers identified themselves as Detroit police, then brandished
guns and took his wallet and the $85 in it, Marshall told the jury.
   Bell received a one- to 10-year sentence, and Hankins received a
1{- to 10-year sentence on the armed robbery convictions. Bell also
was convicted of using a firearm to commit a felony and received a
mandatory two-year prison term.

<TEXT>
   The defense minister said today that Israel is
ready to respond to any armed threat from Iraq, and that Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait shows that its president, Saddam Hussein, poses
a threat to the entire world.
   The minister, Moshe Arens, told NBC television that Saddam's
action was reminiscent of Nazi Germany's aggression in the 1930s.
Iraq's forces overran its small oil-rich neighbor in a lightning
strike before dawn today.
   ``Iraq will be looking around for other targets,'' Arens said,
adding that Saddam ``represents a threat to the entire world, not
just Israel.''
   He told ABC television in a separate interview that Israel would
step in ``only if Iraq takes aggressive action against Israel.''
   But an Israeli government official who briefed reporters on the
basis of anonymity said Iraq was aware there were ``red lines''
that could not be crossed without bringing an Israeli response.
   Asked if that included Iraqi entry into Jordan or Syria, the
official said such a move would require ``very strong
consideration'' by Israel.
   The Israeli Cabinet was to discuss the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
today.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's spokesman said the
invasion bears out Israel's warnings that Saddam poses a genuine
threat.
   ``We need to call on the international arena to open their eyes
and see what is happening and to understand we need to take Saddam
Hussein seriously, that he threatens and then carries out,'' the
spokesman, Avi Pazner, told Israel radio.
   Saddam had threatened military action against Kuwait for its
overproduction of oil, which has reduced prices for Iraq's oil.
After threats, demands and abortive peace talks, Iraqi troops
invaded.
   Pazner noted that Iraq is heavily armed from its eight-year war
with Iran, which ended in 1988.
   ``Iraq has also proven that it doesn't hesitate to use this
against its immediate neighbors and this policy of Saddam Hussein
is what endangers the region's security,'' Pazner said.
   He said the Iraqi attack made clear ``that if there is a danger
to the stability in the Middle East it is not our conflict with the
Palestinians.''
   Yossi Olmert, director of the Government Press Office, said
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait proved Israel was right in taking
seriously Saddam's repeated threats to attack Israel with chemical
weapons if it attacked any Iraqi facilities.
   ``There was a period a few weeks ago when his threats were only
directed toward us and people outside Israel didn't take him
seriously,'' Olmert said.
   Yitzhak Rabin, a former defense minister, also said the Iraqi
attack shows that the easing of U.S.-Soviet tensions has increased
rather than lessened the danger of war in the Middle East.
   ``Glasnost has not arrived in the Middle East. Arms are still
flowing into the Middle East from all places,'' Rabin said on Army
radio.

<HEAD>Testimony: Coe Had Pitiful Childhood, Faces Threats in Jail</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note contents in 10th graf.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted of murder after plunging
his stepson into a toilet should be spared the death penalty
because he's had a pitiful life, his parents told the jury that's
considering his sentence today.
   Thomas Coe, 23, was born with painful kidney and hip defects,
wore a catheter until he was 5, was hospitalized more than 30 times
and walked with a limp, jurors learned Wednesday.
   Coe's mother, Mary Coe Anders, said she had to pay other
children to play with him.
   His father, Don, told jurors he ignored the boy he claimed was
the result of an affair the mother had.
   That doesn't excuse Coe for killing 2-year-old Bradley McGee
last July, lawyer Robert Norgard said. But it shows he ``suffered
ramifications on into adulthood'' and helps explain why Coe
shouldn't get the electric chair, he said.
   The jury, which found Coe guilty of first-degree murder and
aggravated child abuse on Monday, can recommend that Circuit Judge
Randall McDonald give him death or life in prison without parole
for 25 years.
   Even in prison, Coe could face an uncertain future.
   Lt. Mike Pol, a shift commander at the Polk County Jail, said
inmates have threatened to kill Coe ever since his arrest on July
29, 1989. Word of Coe's offense reached the jail as soon as he was
booked, and inmates hung upside-down pictures of Coe on the wall,
with a toilet underneath.
   Coe has been held in an isolation cell for protection and
several times has been placed on suicide watch.
   Even in isolation, inmates at the jail have managed to put glass
and steel wool in Coe's food, Pol said. Once, when Coe was going to
see the doctor, inmates threw lye, urine and feces on him. Coe had
used urine and feces to punish his stepson, according to trial
testimony.
   As a child, Coe's physical problems were compounded by his
parents' divorce. Family and friends told the jury he was suicidal
by age 18 and felt inadequate and out of place with peers.
   The state called one witness during the penalty phase of the
trial, an assistant medical examiner, who said Bradley could feel
pain when he was repeatedly plunged headfirst into the toilet for
soiling his pants.
   The boy's head struck the bottom of the bowl and he later died
of head injuries.
   Coe's wife, Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, pleaded no contest to
second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse in her son's death
and is serving a 30-year prison term.

<HEAD>Pentagon Source Says U.S. Aircraft Carrier Heading Toward Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The aircraft carrier USS Independence is
steaming toward the Persian Gulf to beef up the U.S. presence in
the troubled region in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
Pentagon sources said today.
   The carrier, escorted by its six-ship battle group, has been in
the Indian Ocean as part of a regularly scheduled deployment. The
Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Independence would not enter the Persian Gulf.
   The move comes as President Bush, meeting this morning with
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and other top aides at the White
House, condemned the Iraqi invasion as ``naked aggression.''
   The president called for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi
forces.
   Speaking with reporters before a meeting of his top national
security advisers, Bush said he would ``take whatever steps
necessary to defend longstanding vital interests in the Gulf.''
   Asked if that included military force, he said, ``We're not
discussing intervention,'' while acknowledging, ``I would not
discuss any military options'' publicly.
   Lights burned throughout the night at the Pentagon.
   Top military commanders and Cheney aides _ including
Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz _ worked all night on
Bush's speech on defense issues and trying to respond to the crisis
in the Gulf.
   U.S. carriers traditionally have stayed out of the
battle-scarred waterway, not only because of their size, but also
to prevent them from becoming targets.
   However, the presence of the Forrestal-class carrier, bristling
with attack aircraft and missiles, offers a potent symbol of U.S.
military power.
   The ship's escort craft include two cruisers _ including one of
the Aegis class _ a guided missile destroyer, two frigates and one
ammunition ship.
   The carrier and its support group are prepared to bolster the
U.S. naval forces in the Gulf, an eight-ship group led by the USS
LaSalle.
   The LaSalle is a converted amphibious transport dock ship that
still has amphibious assault capabilities. Additional command
headquarters and communications gear were added to the ship to
serve as a command platform for the U.S. commander of Middle East
forces.
   It's accompanied by a cruiser, one destroyer and five frigates.
   Two of those ships recently entered the Gulf to relieve two of
the six ships that have been stationed there, the Pentagon said.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming accepted $90,600
in honoraria last year; Republican colleague David Durenberger of
Minnesota took $62,185. Across the aisle, Democratic Sens. David
Boren of Oklahoma and Don Riegle of Michigan each raked in more
than $52,000.
   Yet the four were among 77 senators who voted Wednesday to ban
outside speaking fees, lining up to partake in one of Capitol
Hill's favorite events _ a free vote. Indeed, 56 of the 77 voting
to ban honoraria accepted such payments last year _ to the tune of
nearly $2 million.
   Several of the 56 have since stopped accepting honoraria. But
for the rest who still do, Wednesday's vote most likely will not
choke the flow of millions in speaking and appearance fees from
special interests.
   Last year alone, senators accepted nearly $3 million in
honoraria and kept $2.1 million for personal use, giving the rest
to charity _ in most cases to keep within Senate limits on outside
income.
   The vote Wednesday was significant, if only symbolically,
because for the first time the Senate went on record against
accepting special interest fees. Such honoraria have figured
prominently in several recent ethics cases against lawmakers and
were banned on the House side effective this year.
   But the provision, sponsored by Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd
of Connecticut, was attached to a campaign finance measure that is
vehemently opposed by Republicans lawmakers and the Bush
administration.
   The overall measure cleared the Senate late Wednesday night, but
the House has yet to act on the issue and has major differences
with the Senate. On top of that, President Bush is promising to
veto the legislation if it carries the Senate-passed provisions.
   ``This bill clearly will not become law,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell
of Kentucky told his colleagues after speaking to White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu.
   Thus, in the words of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, the
amendment gave senators a chance to ``vote no and take the dough''
_ at least until the proposal is attached to legislation with a
better chance of becoming law.
   But some publicly hailed the vote, hoping to keep the pressure
on senators.
   ``It is just a matter of time before the Senate joins the rest
of the federal government in banning private interest speaking fees
for personal use,'' said Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer.
   Election Day is just three months away, and the proposal to ban
honoraria was popular among senators facing voters this year _ even
many who have handsomely supplemented their Senate salary in the
past.
   Among those voting for the proposal who face re-election were
Democratic Sens. Max Baucus of Montana, Joseph Biden of Delaware,
David Boren of Oklahoma, Albert Gore of Tennessee, Howell Heflin of
Alabama, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Sam Nunn of Georgia,
David Pryor of Arkansas and Paul Simon of Illinois. They accepted a
combined total of $335,148 in honoraria last year.
   On the Republican side, five senators up for re-election this
year who accepted at least $20,000 in honoraria in 1989 voted in
favor of the ban _ Dan Coats of Indiana, William Cohen of Maine,
Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Ted
Stevens of Alaska. They accepted a combined $212,900 last year.
Also voting in favor of the ban was GOP Sen. Pete Wilson, the
Republican candidate for governor in California, who accepted
$48,500 in 1989.
   Six Republican senators up for re-election this year, apparently
undaunted by the potential use of their vote as a campaign issue,
voted against the ban. The six _ Sens. McConnell of Kentucky, Mark
Hatfield of Oregon, Phil Gramm of Texas, Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota
_ collected a combined $212,815 in honoraria last year.
   The Dodd proposal also found favor among all six senators with
cases pending before the Ethics Committee: Democrat Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona, Alan Cranston of California, John Glenn of
Ohio and Riegle, and Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Alfonse
D'Amato of New York.
   Cranston, DeConcini and Glenn were among 21 senators who did not
accept honoraria in 1989. Riegle, McCain and D'Amato accepted a
combined $125,000 in honoraria last year, with McCain giving all
$30,250 of his to charity.

   Bertha, downgraded from a hurricane
to a tropical storm, continued to lose strength today, a day after
its winds and rain broke apart a freighter off the U.S. coast.
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said at 6 a.m. EDT today
that Bertha was centered near Port Aux Basques on the southwest tip
of Newfoundland, with tropical storm-force winds of at least 39 mph.
   Bertha dropped below hurricane strength late Wednesday.
   The crew of the cargo ship Corazon, broken by 30-foot waves
spawned by Hurricane Bertha abandoned ship in churning, chilly
seas, the Coast Guard said today. Six crew members of the freighter
drowned after the ship's keel snapped about 350 miles off Cape Cod.
Twenty-one others were rescued by commercial ships providing
lifeboats and rafts, the Coast Guard said.
   Heavy rainfall warnings for Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island
and eastern New Brunswick were discontinued by the Canadian
government.
   At least six people were injured Wednesday in Nova Scotia during
the high seas, though the hurricane skirted the mainland. Earlier
Wednesday, forecasters had predicted it would hit Nova Scotia with
full force.
   Meanwhile, the Atlantic hurricane season's fourth tropical
depression became its named tropical storm, Cesar.
   It formed off the coast of Africa and moved westward across the
Atlantic Ocean, said Max Mayfield at the National Hurricane Center.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Cesar was centered near latitude 16.7 north,
longitude 35.1 west, or about 625 miles west of the westernmost
Cape Verde islands.
   It was moving west-northwest near 16 mph with maximum sustained
winds of near 40 mph, and some increase in strength is likely
during the next day or two, said forecaster Miles Lawrence.

   A couple in their 40s who described
themselves on videotape as fearful of growing old calmly talked of
suicide, mailed the tape to a relative and took their lives, police
said.
   A horror-stricken Ronald Ridenour raced Wednesday to the Anaheim
home of his 48-year-old brother, Douglas, and 45-year-old
sister-in-law, Dana, after he viewed the videotape at his house in
Santa Barbara.
   There, he found their bodies slumped on separate couches in the
den, along with the bodies of their two cherished poodles, police
Capt. Stan Kantor said.
   ``They decided they reached the age where they have gone as far
as they are going to go,'' said Sgt. Chet Barry. ``They decided
they wanted to make the decision as to when it all should end.''
   The murder-suicide had taken place two days earlier, Barry said.
Ridenour apparently shot his wife before turning the 12-gauge
shotgun on himself, he said. The couple, who had been married 22
years, had no children.
   Ronald Ridenour received the videotape in the mail, along with a
will, a receipt for cremation services and some personal effects,
Barry said.
   ``He told me (last week) that I'd be receiving an important
package in the mail,'' Ronald said Wednesday. ``As soon as I saw
those papers, I knew what the videotape was.''
   In the 15-minute videotape, Douglas and Dana described some
recent successes in real estate and said they planned to go on a
$50,000 spending spree.
   The couple then talked about their fears of growing old and of
ending their lives, Barry said.
   ``They said they had a full life and are very happy with it,''
Barry said. ``But neither one had a desire to grow old, and they
were going to take care of it. They didn't leave any doubt what
they had in mind.''
   In the tape, they asked Ronald to cremate their bodies and
scatter the ashes in the ocean. They even prepaid for a funeral,
police said.
   The couple apparently had planned the suicide for months because
the tape had been made in April, police said.

   Five members of an animal rights group were
arrested after they tried to stop a mule-diving act in eastern
Maryland.
   But others from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
intend to continue picketing the act, which is scheduled to
continue through Saturday at the Cecil County Fair in Elkton.
   Wednesday's arrests failed to stop the act, billed as ``the
world's only high-diving mules.'' The animals jump from an 18-foot
platform into a 6-foot-deep pool.
   Tim Rivers, the act's manager and mules' owner, said the mules
like the water and none has been injured since it began in 1957.
   Shouting ``stop the torture, stop the pain,'' three protesters
tried to handcuff themselves to the ramp leading to the diving
platform. Two others jumped into the pool.
   Cecil County sheriff's deputies and state police pulled them
from the water, Jackson said.
   All five were charged with disorderly conduct and released after
being given citations, said a spokesman for the county detention
center.
   State police spokesman Chuck Jackson said about 12 demonstrators
picketed outside the fairgrounds.
   The protest came after the group failed to persuade the fair to
bar the act or have animal cruelty charges filed against Rivers.
   Rivers said he only picks mules for the act who like the water.
   ``I'm not an animal activist, but I am an animal lover,'' Rivers
said. ``Animals are my life. For me to abuse my animals would be
for me to abuse my living.''
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a Washington-based
group that claims 325,000 members, contends that the animals hit
the water at 30 mph and emerge dazed and gasping for air.
   It has fought Rivers in several other states, in demonstrations
and through court challenges.
   The Cecil County Humane Society said it had no legal grounds to
challenge the act, saying nothing in state law prohibits it.
   Jenny Woods, a spokewoman for People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals, said the group would continue to picket and hand out
leaflets.

   ABC's quirky drama ``Twin Peaks,''
which astounded critics and confounded television viewers, captured
a leading 14 nominations today for the 42nd Annual Primetime Emmy
Awards.
   NBC's legal drama ``L.A. Law'' earned 13 nominations, and NBC's
``Cheers'' and CBS's ``Murphy Brown'' each received 12 nominations.
   ``The Simpsons,'' the irreverent animated program from
cartoonist Matt Groening, had five nominations. The series got
three nominations, including best animated program, and ``The
Simpsons Christmas Special'' received two.
   ABC, which finished last among the three networks in nominations
last year, tied for first with NBC with 95 nominations. CBS drew 73
selections and the Fox Broadcasting Co. earned 23, up from 12 a
year ago.
   The selections were announced in a predawn ceremony at the
Beverly Hilton Hotel by Dana Delany of ABC's ``China Beach'' and
Louis Gossett Jr., both Emmy winners themselves.
   Director David Lynch's ``Twin Peaks'' was nominated for
outstanding drama series and its star Kyle MacLachlan was nominated
for best actor in a drama series for his performance as enigmatic,
pie-loving FBI agent Dale Cooper.
   The series also collected a nomination for lead actress Piper
Laurie, two nominations for writing, and one to Lynch for directing
the acclaimed pilot episode.
   Other nominees for best drama series were ABC's ``China Beach,''
NBC's ``L.A. Law'' and ``Quantum Leap,'' and ABC's
``thirtysomething.''
   ``Cheers,'' the Boston bar comedy, was nominated again for best
comedy series, which it won last year. Also nominated were CBS'
``Designing Women,'' and ``Murphy Brown,'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls'' and ABC's ``The Wonder Years.''
   ABC's ``The Kennedys of Massachusetts,'' with eight nominations,
headed the list of nominees for best miniseries. Other nominees
were NBC's ``Blind Faith,'' NBC's ``Drug Wars: The Camarena
Story,'' CBS' ``Family of Spies'' and ABC's ``Small Sacrifices.''
   The CBS movie ``Caroline?'' drew six nominations, including best
drama-comedy special. It will face ABC's ``The Final Days,'' CBS'
``The Incident'' and ``A Killing in a Small Town,'' and NBC's
``Murder in Mississippi.''
   Despite actress Tracey Ullman's decision to end her inventive
Fox variety series, it won a total of 13 nominations. ``The Tracey
Ullman Show'' received nine nominations, and ``The Best of the
Tracey Ullman Show'' was recognized four times.
   Other multiple nominees included ``thirtysomething'' with 11,
the syndicated ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' with nine and
``The Golden Girls'' with eight.
   ``Roseanne,'' the top-rated but increasingly controversial
comedy series, earned just two nominations, including a best comedy
actor selection for series co-star John Goodman.
   Series star Roseanne Barr was not nominated, but her exclusion
had nothing to do with her shrilly mangled rendition of the
national anthem at a San Diego Padres baseball game. Emmy balloting
closed before her infamous performance.
   ``Roseanne'' and its leading performer also were overlooked in
last year's nominations, even though the situation comedy was the
nation's favorite.
   Also overlooked was ``The Cosby Show,'' which has been one of
TV's most consistent hits but hasn't been an Emmy winner since 1986.
   Richard Mulligan, who won the Emmy for best comedy actor last
year, was nominated again in the category for NBC's ``Empty Nest.''
He will face Goodman, Ted Danson of ``Cheers,'' Craig T. Nelson of
ABC's ``Coach'' and child star Fred Savage of ABC's ``The Wonder
Years.''
   Their female counterparts in the comedy competition were Kirstie
Alley for ``Cheers,'' Delta Burke for CBS's ``Designing Women,''
Betty White in ``The Golden Girls,'' Candice Bergen in ``Murphy
Brown'' and Blair Brown for ``The Days &amp; Nights of Molly Dodd,''
which is seen on cable's Lifetime network.
   For supporting performances in a comedy, the choices were Woody
Harrelson and Kelsey Grammer for ``Cheers,'' Jerry Van Dyke in
``Coach,'' Charles Kimbrough for ``Murphy Brown'' and Alex Rocco in
CBS' ``The Famous Teddy Z.''
   Supporting comic actress were Rhea Perlman and Bebe Neuwirth in
``Cheers,'' Estelle Getty for ``The Golden Girls, '' Faith Ford
from ``Murphy Brown'' and Julia Duffy in CBS' ``Newhart.''
   Nominated for dramatic actor were Peter Falk for ABC's
``Columbo,'' Edward Woodward from CBS' ``The Equalizer,'' Robert
Loggia in NBC's ``Mancuso FBI,'' Scott Bakula in ``Quantum Leap''
and MacLachlan from ``Twin Peaks.''
   Dramatic actress choices were Dana Delaney in ``China Beach,''
Jill Eikenberry from ``L.A. Law,'' Angela Lansbury for CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote,'' Patricia Wettig of ``thirtysomething'' and
Miss Laurie for ``Twin Peaks.''
   ``L.A. Law'' collected three of the nominations for supporting
dramatic actor, for Richard Dysart, Larry Drake and Jimmy Smits.
Dean Stockwell was chosen from ``Quantum Leap'' and Timothy
Busfield of ``thirtysomething,'' who's in a contract dispute with
the show.
   Sherilyn Fenn, who plays Audrey Horne on ``Twin Peaks,'' was
nominated for best supporting dramatic actress, as were Marg
Helgenberger of ``China Beach,'' Melanie Mayron of
``thirtysomething'' and Diana Muldaur and Susan Ruttan of ``L.A.
Law.''
   Among the more notable nominations was one for the late Jim
Henson, who created the Muppets. He was named for directing a
variety or music program, ``The Song of the Cloud Forest,'' from
``The Jim Henson Hour.''
   ``In Living Color,'' the daring black sketch comedy show, was
nominated for best variety, music or comedy series.
   A total of 361 nominations were made. The Emmy winners will be
selected Aug. 26-27 by directors, actors and writers.
   The awards ceremony will be broadcast live on Fox on Sept. 16
from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. It will be the third
consecutive Emmy broadcast for Fox, which has rights to the
ceremony for two more years.

<HEAD>All South Koreans Can Apply to Visit North, Seoul Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY SMITH TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea said today all citizens
would be allowed to apply to visit Communist North Korea during a
five-day period next month, provided the North guarantees their
safe return.
   The announcement was the first time South Korea has offered to
let all citizens apply to cross the border and visit the North. A
1985 exchange program was limited to about 100 people who were
members of separated families.
   ``We hope...this would not only lead to the reunion of separated
families, but also the sharing of the emotional excitment by
embracing each other after 45 years of separation,'' Unification
Minister Hong Sung-chul told reporters.
   All applicants accepted by the North would be allowed to cross
the border Aug. 13-17, Hong said. That implied that even if the
North chooses to allow only South Korean dissidents to visit, the
South would allow them to go.
   Previously, the Seoul government's position has been that
Koreans from ``all walks of life'' must be included in proposed
travel exchanges.
   Hong said the government expected North Korea to guarantee the
travelers' safe travel and return to South Korea by communicating
on a government-to-government basis, not via a radio broadcast.
   North Korea frequently issues pronouncements concerning policy
on North Korean radio broadcasts, monitored in Tokyo.
   The Seoul government's announcement follows a July 20
proclamation by South Korean President Roh Tae-woo calling for a
five-day border opening to allow free and unrestricted travel
between the hostile Koreas. The North had earlier proposed a more
limited one-day border opening.
   North Korea effectively rejected Roh's proposal by listing a set
of conditions unlikely to be met, including release of political
prisoners, dismantling of border barriers and abolition of
anti-Communist security laws.
   When the South proposed a meeting to discuss the preconditions,
the North did not reply.
   By today's announcement and presentation of an application form,
the government appears to be trying to put pressure on the North to
accept a trial exchange.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 and the two nations fought a civil war in
the early 1950s.
   The border between the Koreas is the most heavily fortified in
the world with more than 1.5 million armed troops behind concrete
bunkers and barbed wire on either side.
   There are no telephone, radio, television or travel exchanges.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III condemned Iraq's attack on Kuwait today and said he had asked
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to immediately cease
Soviet arms deliveries to Iraq.
   Baker spoke to reporters aboard a U.S. Air Force jet heading
from a meeting with the Soviet foreign minister in the Siberian
city of Irkutsk to Ulan Bator, the capital of Mongolia.
   Baker later said he would cut short his Mongolian visit and fly
back to Washington on Friday, two days earlier than scheduled. The
move came after he conferred with President Bush by telephone, the
secretary told reporters.
   The secretary said he asked Shevardnadze to halt ``any military
or arms deliveries that they might have in the pipeline to Iraq.''
   Baker said Shevardnadze ``was not pleased to hear that Iraqi
forces had moved into Kuwait,'' but the U.S. envoy declined to
comment on whether the Soviet foreign minister agreed to stop arms
deliveries.
   ``We condemn this. We want Iraq to withdraw,'' Baker told
reporters. ``Intimidation is not the way to solve problems.''
   Baker said he heard about the invasion just before he went into
a final negotiating session with Shevardnadze this morning.
   The secretary was to leave for Washington Friday afternoon after
meeting with Mongolian opposition members and hosting Mongolian
government officials at a lunch. He had originally planned to take
a private hunting and fishing trip in the Gobi Desert.
   Baker he also was keeping in touch with developments in Kuwait
through Lt. Gen. Howard Graves of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who is traveling with him.
   Graves, who was in touch with the Pentagon, said the United
States was considering ``political, military or economic'' moves
against Iraq.
   ``A decision is being made,'' said Graves, who is assistant to
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Baker told reporters at the start of a meeting with Mongolian
President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat that he planned to complete the
official portion of his visit, but it was not clear if the schedule
would be accelerated because of the Persian Gulf developments.
   Baker, the highest-level American to visit in 46 years,
expressed support for recent democratic reforms in this long-time
Soviet satellite nation.
   ``We are very heartened by the peaceful emergence of democracy
in Mongolia,'' he told reporters as he sat down for talks with
Ochirbat.``We have expressed our desire to continue to support
political and economic reforms in Mongolia.''

   The U.N. Security Council today swiftly
condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, demanding an unconditional
withdrawal of Iraqi troops and calling for immediate negotiations
between the countries.
   The Iraqi envoy said his country's troops would withdraw ``as
soon as the situation is stable,'' perhaps within ``a few days or
some weeks.''
   The Security Council resolution was adopted 14-0 in an emergency
session requested by the United States and Kuwait hours after
today's pre-dawn invasion. Neither Kuwait nor Iraq is on the
15-member council.
   The representative of Yemen said he did not vote because he had
not received instructions from his government.
   Britain's U.N. envoy, Crispin Tickell, condemned the invasion as
an ``ugly moment in world affairs.'' Kuwait is a former British
colony.
   ``The United States has made it clear that it will stand
shoulder to shoulder with Kuwait in this time of crisis,'' U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Pickering told the council. ``It is our
understanding that the present aggression was completely
unprovoked.''
   Baghdad radio claimed Iraq had come to the aid of
``revolutionary youth in Kuwait'' whom it said had toppled the
Kuwaiti government.
   Kuwait's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Abulhasan,
denied the invasion was in response to a call from help from a new
government.
   ``The pretext to invade an independent, sovereign state is a
false, flimsy pretext,'' he said. ``This kind of pretext, if it's
not going to be deterred in a decisive manner and by this august
assembly, all international relations will be threatened. No
country at all will be safe after this.''
   A statement read by Sabah Talat Kadrat, Iraq's deputy permanant
representative said Iraq's forces would withdraw when what it
referred to as the ``free Kuwaiti interim government'' requested it.
   The Iraqi statement was also reported by the Iraqi News Agency
in Baghdad.
   The Security Council resolution said the council supports all
efforts for negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait. It specifically
endorsed mediation efforts by the Arab League, which met in
emergency session in Cairo today.
   The Iraqi invasion posed ``a breach of international peace and
security,'' the Security Council said.
   Kadrat said the events were related to an internal matter that
was not the council's concern.
   ``The Iraqi government firmly believes and states that Iraq is
pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations
with Kuwait,'' said Kadrat. ``Furthermore, it is the Kuwaitis
themselves who will determine their own future and Iraqi forces
will withdraw as soon as order has been restored.''
   Members of the 15-member Security Council began gathering at the
United Nations shortly after midnight. Diplomats held more than
three hours of private consultations before convening the formal
meeting.
   Kuwaiti spokesman Nasser Al-Sabeeh said before the formal
meeting that Kuwait wants negotiations with Iraq to be mediated by
the Arab League.
   ``But if it's necessary, then we would seek U.N. mediation,'' he
said.
   Two weeks ago, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq threatened
military action with Kuwait over its violation of OPEC oil
production ceilings and a disputed border oil field.
   Saddam also has accused some Persian Gulf nations of conspiring
with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's economy and
undermine its military buildup.
   Today's resolution was sponsored by Canada, Colombia, Ivory
Coast, Ethiopia, Finland, France, the United States, Britain and
Malaysia.
   The 15 members of the Security Council are China, Yemen,
Romania, the Soviet Union, Cuba, Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast,
Ethiopia, Finland, France, the United States, the United Kingdom,
Malaysia and Zaire.

   Uzbekistan's government announced steps today to
implement a presidential order to seize weapons from illegally
armed groups.
   The Uzbekistan Council of Ministers ordered city councils to
collect illegal arms in their regions, Tass reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said 3,685 weapons were seized
or handed in voluntarily before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
July 25 decree. Tass said 254 stolen guns were still missing.
   Gorbachev gave illegally armed groups throughout the Soviet
Union 15 days to disband themselves and turn in their weapons, or
risk having them confiscated by security forces.
   It was his latest attempt to reduce ethnic violence in the
southern Caucasus and Central Asian republics that has killed more
than 400 people in the last two years.
   The Armenian parliament has voted to ignore the decree, although
Tass reported today that lawmakers said they would be willing to
discuss their decision with Gorbachev who is vacationing in the
Crimea.
   Armenian nationalists said earlier this week the decision would
also extend to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly
Armenian enclave inside the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
   Georgia has also refused to implement the decree, at least until
its parliament resumes work on Aug. 17.
   Azerbaijan's Interior Ministry published a commentary in today's
local newspapers praising the decree for giving law enforcement
agencies powers to restore order and neutralize extremists, the
Interfax news agency reported.
   In the Armenian capital, Yerevan, 100 flamethrowers were seized
after an attack on a military unit, Interfax said.

   Roswell Gilbert walked out of a Florida
prison a free man today after serving 5{ years for the 1985 ``mercy
killing'' of his ailing wife.
   The 81-year-old Gilbert, granted clemency by Gov. Bob Martinez
and the Florida Cabinet because he suffers from heart and lung
disease, was freed from the North Florida Reception Center at Lake
Butler shortly after 9 a.m.
   Gilbert, who had breakfast earlier at the prison with his
daughter, Martha Moran of Baltimore, smiled broadly as he left the
jail, but he expressed remorse over the killing of his wife, who
suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
   ``I shouldn't have killed my wife, now I know that,'' he said.
``I know the public at least understood what I did if they didn't
approve of it.''
   He called the slaying an ``act of desperation.''
   ``That was an error I made,'' Gilbert said. ``That's not an
excuse, but that's what it was. ... It's such a personal thing,
it's difficult to explain to anybody.''
   He called Alzheimer's ``a horror, an absolute horror,'' and said
he believes euthanasia should be legalized for some cases.
   Mrs. Moran said she believes her mother would say: ``It's about
time they let him out.''
   Gilbert and his daughter planned to drive to the Fort Lauderdale
area, where he will spend several days at an undisclosed location
before returning to his condominium in Fort Lauderdale.
   Gilbert tried to light a cigarette just after entering the
rental car, but his daughter and attorney Brad Stark objected.
   ``No this, no that,'' joked Gilbert. ``I'm free now.''
   Gilbert, who lost nearly 40 pounds in prison, said he needed to
begin rebuilding his health, but pledged not to give up smoking
despite his lung problems.
   ``I'm a tough old rooster,'' he said.
   Gilbert was serving a 25-year prison term for murder in the 1985
shooting of his wife, Emily, who had Alzheimer's disease and
osteoporosis.
   The case, depicted in the 1987 TV movie ``Mercy or Murder,''
focused national attention on the so-called ``mercy killing'' of an
ailing loved one.
   Gilbert had said his wife begged him to end her misery.
Prosecutors claimed the retired engineer killed the 73-year-old
woman because she had become a burden to him.
   The inmate was examined in January and doctors said he suffered
from heart and lung disease and was ``at high risk of death at any
time.''
   In Florida, clemency requires the approval of the governor and
at least three of the six members of the independently elected
Cabinet.
   The needed votes came quickly, with Comptroller Gerald Lewis,
Education Commissioner Betty Castor and Attorney General Bob
Butterworth signing the petition less than 90 minutes after
Martinez announced plans to grant clemency.
   ``Mr. Gilbert's declining health, and the likelihood that his
condition will continue to deteriorate if he remains in prison,
leads me to the conclusion that he should be granted clemency,''
said Martinez, who previously opposed freeing Gilbert.
   ``I don't really condone the action that occurred some years
ago, but you've got to mix that with some compassion.''

<HEAD>Witness Says Businesses Denied Credit Because of Cleanup Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers, furniture refinishers and funeral
homes are being denied credit because lenders fear being stuck with
cleanup costs if pollution is found on the properties, the
president of a small Ohio bank told Congress today.
   Businesses that use chemicals such as auto paint and embalming
fluids and properties with underground storage tanks are considered
undesirable loan risks because of recent court interpretations of
the 10-year-old Superfund law, said R. Duane Lillibridge, president
of Farmers Savings Bank, Northwood, Ohio.
   Farmland ``is considered highly suspect, and unfortunately we
are being forced to wind down our loans in this critical sector of
our economy,'' Lillibridge told the House transportation and
hazardous materials subcommittee.
   ``If we are unable to obtain some relief ... Ohio bankers will
soon be unable to look to real estate as collateral,'' he said in
prepared testimony.
   The Superfund law gave the federal government the power to move
in on heavily polluted properties, clean up the contamination and
then force the property owners to pay for it. In May, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a lender that forecloses on a
polluted property could be held liable for cleanup costs under
Superfund.
   The subcommitee's chairman, Rep. Thomas Luken, D-Ohio, said the
court rulings on Superfund liability could have an ominous impact
on the $500 billion taxpayer cost of the savings and loan bailout
and ``inflate these astronomical figures even more.''
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. submitted testimony
estimating 270 properties in its possession may have Superfund
problems, Luken said.
   ``All American taxpayers have an important stake in how these
problems are resolved,'' said Luken, who supports a bill by Rep.
John LaFale D-N.Y., to exempt lenders from Superfund liability when
they foreclose on contaminated property.
   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., criticized the bill this week in a
letter to fellow House members. ``The bill condones bad loans to
polluting businesses and tells lenders that the government will

   The Environmental Protection Agency submitted testimony

<HEAD>Foreigners in Kuwait Say They're Shocked By Sudden Iraqi Invasion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Iraq-Kuwait, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners living in Kuwait said they
watched from their windows or dived for cover when Iraq staged a
lightning invasion of Kuwait today.
   Reached by telephone from Bahrain, the expatriates told of
hearing gunfire, explosions, and jets and helicopters overhead as
the Iraqi troops moved in before dawn.
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Catherine Baker, 37, of Illinois, who
works for a British design firm in the small oil-rich nation. ``It
doesn't seem real.''
   There are about 4,000 Americans among the large expatriate
community in Kuwait, where more than 60 percent of the 1.8 million
residents are foreigners. Ms. Baker said she was shocked by the
suddenness of the Iraqi strike, although Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein had made threats against Kuwait in recent weeks.
   ``We were totally unprepared,'' she said. ``One feels like there
should have been a bit of warning.''
   U.S. officials monitoring the situation had no reports that U.S.
citizens in Iraq had been harmed, White House spokesman Roman
Popadiuk said.
   Diplomats said the British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the
Sheraton and Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele.
   Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that more than
200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded in the invasion.
   Kathy McGregor, 32, a Canadian, said one explosion was close
enough to shake her home.
   ``You know when you see a movie, when people dive for cover? We
did it. The explosion blew inside the house, shaking it,'' she said.
   ``It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time,'' Ms.
McGregor said by telephone early today as she watched from her
window. But in the afternoon, she said things had quieted down
considerably.
   ``There is not much noise or gunfire. I feel better with more
people around now,'' she said.
   Some expatriates said they did not want to leave despite the
invasion.
   ``I think it will be over soon somehow,'' said Serge Sejournet,
30, an artist from Paris. ``I don't think I want to get out of
Kuwait.''
   Sejournet said the Iraqi soldiers on the street in front of his
home in downtown Kuwait were ``very friendly with everyone, saying
hello to all.''
   Sejournet said he thought the United States would ``bring the
situation under control.''
   President Bush said the United States _ which has warships in
the Persian Gulf area and more on the way, according to reports out
of Washington _ would ``take whatever steps necessary'' to defend
interests in the region.
   Asked if this included military force, Bush said: ``We're not
discussing intervention.'' But he said he would not discuss
military options publicly.
   Sejournet, Ms. Baker and other expatriates said they gathered
together in homes of friends, listening to the fighting.
   Western diplomats said the invasion was too sudden to try to
carry out any evacuation. For the time being, they simply advised
foreign residents to keep a low profile until the situation was
calmer.
   Anxious friends and relatives of those living in Kuwait found it
difficult or impossible to get in touch with them. In Washington, a
spokesman for AT&amp;T said calls to Kuwait reached 2,000 every five
minutes.
   The spokesman, Herb Linnen, said only some of the calls were
getting through, and there were long delays because of the heavy
volume.
   Linnen said the company itself had managed to get only one call
through to its employees in Kuwait today and ascertained that the
several dozen employees and their families were safe.
   AT&amp;T employees in Kuwait include Americans, Canadians, British,
Filipinos and one Sri Lankan who have been working on a project
with the Kuwaiti government to improve communications, he said.
   The State Department, meanwhile, set up a 24-hour hotline for
people seeking information about the safety of American relatives
and friends in Kuwait and Iraq. The number is (202) 647-0900.

   A bus driver has been sentenced to a
record 190 years in prison for causing the deaths of 28
schoolchildren and 10 others in a 1989 accident, court officials
said Thurdsay.
   The High Court on Wednesday found driver Sriyan Ananda guilty of
homicide on all 38 counts of rash and negligent driving, said the
officials who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   The accident happened Jan. 17, 1989, when Ananda failed to stop
at a rail crossing and drove into the path of a speeding train at
Ahungala, 45 miles south of Colombo.
   Survivors said Ananda tried to cross the track despite screams
of warnings by passengers. Ananda had claimed that the bus engine
stalled on the track.
   Judge Wimal B. Dassanayake sentenced him to five years on each
of the 38 counts with the terms to run consecutively. A senior
police officer said it was the longest jail term ever given for a
traffic offense.
   Ananda, a 48-year-old employee of the state-owned bus company,
can appeal.

<HEAD>Ukrainian City Takes Down Lenin's Statue, Orders Marx's Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ukrainian city of Chervonograd dismantled its
monument to Vladimir Lenin and has ordered Karl Marx's monument be
removed within three days, Tass reported Thursday.
   The orders were made during an emergency session of the city
council on Wednesday, the official Soviet news agency said. It did
not elaborate.
   Tass quoted the regional prosecutor in nearby Lvov as saying the
council's orders were illegal and should be repealed.
   ``The council's decision violates the Ukrainian law on the
protection and use of historical and cultural monuments,'' Leonid
Izosimov told Tass.
   The western Ukrainian city of Ternopol has also outraged local
Communists by ordering the dismantling or sale of monuments to
Lenin, the Soviet founder, and Marx, the father of modern
Communism. Moscow City Council voted earlier this year to remove a
bust of Lenin from its chambers.
   Statues of Lenin have also been toppled or damaged in recent
weeks in two dozen towns in southern Georgia and in Lithuania.
Attempts were made to deface them in Azerbaijan and Armenia.
   Since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985,
statues, plaques and other memorials to disgraced Soviet leaders
such as Josef Stalin and Leonid I. Brezhnev have been removed.
   Official criticism of Lenin, however, has been taboo, and for
many he remains a figure of reverence and grandfatherly affection.

<TEXT>
   The government is issuing commemorative
coins to mark this month's 10th anniversary of the Solidarity trade
union.
   The coins, which range in denomination from 10,000 zlotys to
200,000 zlotys, will be made of copper, silver, and gold, the
National Bank of Poland announced Wednesday.
   Only the 10,000 zloty copper coin, worth slightly more than $1,
will be issued for mass circulation. One dollar is worth 9,500
zlotys.
   Currently, the largest Polish coin is worth 20 zlotys, about 0.2
cents. Banknotes range from 10 zlotys to 200,000 zlotys.
   The coins, designed by Polish artist Bogdan Chmielewski, will
bear a variety of symbols connected to the Solidarity trade union.
One side of the 100,000 zloty silver coin, for example, is
inscribed with the official Polish emblem, the crowned eagle, for
the first time since 1939.
   The reverse side bears the date 1980-1990 and the Solidarity
logo with a panorama of Gdansk, where the East bloc's first
independent trade union was born during a wave of strikes in August
1980. It includes the monument erected in honor of shipyard workers
killed there during riots in 1970.
   Sets can be purchased at the bank's branches or offices
throughout Poland, or abroad through Ryan James, Ltd., a New York
numismatics firm, for about $1,600, the bank said.

   What was intended to be a simple gesture of
international friendship has turned into a source of embarrassment
for Missouri highway and economic development officials.
   The multilingual sign they erected outside St. Louis' Lambert
Airport to welcome foreign visitors was botched, in three of seven
languages.
   ``Their intentions were definitely good, and I can understand
how these things happen, but they should have consulted a
dictionary,'' said Antonio M. Molina of suburban University City.
   Molina said the Spanish welcome _ ``Bienvendos a Missouri'' _
should have read ``Bienvenidos a Missouri.'' Molina should know _
his father, the late Jose Molina, was the honorary vice consul from
Spain, and his great-uncle, Jose Alvarez, held the post before him.
   The German and French salutations also were misspelled or
grammatically incorrect. ``Wilkommen in Missouri'' should have read
``Willkommen in Missouri,'' according to James McLeod, professor of
German at Washington University.
   The French version, ``Bienvenue a Missouri,'' should read
``Bienvenue en Missouri.''
   ``The preposition is wrong. People arriving here from France
would laugh at the sign,'' said Jacques Chicoineau, a retired
professor of foreign languages at Webster University.
   The greetings in Japanese, Chinese and Korean were perfect,
however. Oh yes, they also got the English greeting right.
   Jacque Dunn, director of public affairs for the state's
department of economic development, said her office was
reconfirming the translations. Dunn said the translations had been
made with the help of the department's offices overseas.

   A navigation satellite boosted into
orbit by a Delta rocket Thursday is the latest in a series of
spacecrafts capable of pinpointing the location of U.S. military
units to within 50 feet.
   The unmanned rocket thundered into a clear sky at 1:39 a.m.,
trailing fire as it headed out over the Atlantic.
   The $65 million Navstar satellite separated from the booster on
schedule about 25 minutes into the flight and settled into an orbit
10,898 miles high.
   The satellite is the eighth in a series of advanced Global
Positioning System spacecraft that guide U.S. and allied warplanes,
ships, submarines and troops. In some cases, it is accurate to
within 10 feet.
   The Air Force plans to send up 16 more satellites by early 1993,
three of them spares, under the $8.5 billion program. The first
Navstar spacecraft was launched in February 1989.
   The 3,675-pound Navstar satellites, good in any kind of weather,
keep track of the speed of military vehicles within a fraction of a
mile per hour and the time within a millionth of a second. They
contain an atomic clock with an error rate of one second every
300,000 years.
   Military personnel tune in the network's coded radio signals
with receivers as small as a hand-held telephone. Boat and private
aircraft operators also have access to the system.
   Seven earlier, less sophisticated navigational satellites still
are functioning. The newer spacecrafts have a working lifetime of
7{ years.
   McDonnell Douglas of Huntington Beach, Calif., supplied the
128-foot Delta 2 rocket.

   Letter carrier Bob Newkirk usually delivers
the mail, but in this case it was a male _ a baby boy.
   Newkirk had just dropped off the mail at the Race Track Tavern
on Wednesday afternoon when a boy ran up to him, seeking help with
a special delivery.
   ``The little boy came up and said, `You have to help me, my
sister's having a baby!''' Newkirk recalled.
   The boy told him he couldn't call an ambulance from his home
because the telephone wasn't working. So Newkirk took the boy into
the bar, gave him a quarter and told the bartender to call for help.
   Newkirk then sped to the home, where he found the 16-year-old
mother in bed giving birth. The baby's head and shoulders were
already out when he arrived.
   ``Her mother and father were there but they didn't seem to know
what to do,'' Newkirk said, adding he learned emergency medical
procedures as a soldier during the Vietnam War.
   After the birth, Newkirk said, he checked to see that the infant
and his mother were OK, adding: ``If either of them had any
problems we would've taken a quick trip in a post office truck.''
   Said Newkirk: ``It was just a neat experience to be there. My
wife and I are going to go see the baby and take them some stuff.''
   Paramedics took mother and child to the hospital, where both
were reported doing fine, a nursing supervisor said Thursday.

   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A failed coup attempt by Moslem
extremists and widespread looting that resulted left at least 30
people dead and 150 wounded in Trinidad, a government spokesman
said today.
   The authorities expect to find more bodies in Parliament, where
the prime minister and other government ministers were held
hostage, and in a police station that was gutted by a car-bomb and
fire, spokesman Gregory Shaw said.
   Previous reports had said about 20 people died in the coup
attempt, which began Friday with a raid on Parliament and a
government TV station.
   Shaw also confirmed for the first time that Prime Minister N.R.
Robinson, after being shot in the leg, signed agreements to resign,
turn over power to a caretaker government and grant amnesty to the
rebels.
   ``All the agreements were signed under duress, all under
gunpoint, all of which are completely invalid,'' Shaw told
reporters at a news conference.
   Shaw said that the coup leader, Abu Bakr, and his band of 111
militants had dropped their demands before surrendering on
Wednesday and releasing their remaining 46 hostages. A total of 55
hostages had been held.
   ``They caved in completely,'' he said. ``They surrendered
unconditionally.
   Officials have said they will press charges against Bakr and
those who joined him in the coup attempt.
   Shaw said soldiers expect to go into Parliament and the nearby
police station on Friday to search for bodies and unexploded bombs.
Soldiers standing outside the buildings said they were waiting one
day to go inside because of fears of time-delayed explosives.
   The security forces also evacuated 2,000 to 3,000 people from
the vicinity of the government television station, where 29
hostages were held after the building was seized last Friday. That
building also will be searched.
   Shaw said the dead included looters shot by the security forces,
but he gave no breakdown.
   The capital was quiet this morning. People remained indoors,
under a 6 p.m. to noon curfew that remained in effect.
   State radio said Leo des Vignes, a junior government minister
taken hostage Friday and released a day later, died of a heart
attack Wednesday in a hospital. He had been shot in the heel.
   Deputy Prime Minister Winston Dookeran said Wednesday that
``appropriate charges'' would be brought against the militants.
   Asked whether the charges would include murder and treason,
Dookeran said it would be up to the judicial authorities to decide.
   Bakr, a former policeman who converted to Islam and considers
himself a champion of the downtrodden, was under heavy guard along
with the other 111 rebels at army headquarters in Chaguerames in
northwest Trinidad.
   The freed hostages spent the night at Camp Ogden, another army
base near the capital of Port-of-Spain, for medical exams and
treatment.
   Bakr had demanded Robinson's ouster, accusing him of corruption
and blaming him for widespread poverty in this once oil-rich
Caribbean nation of 1.3 million people.
   The 63-year-old prime minister was freed Tuesday and
hospitalized for treatment of a leg wound suffered in the attack as
well as exhaustion and glaucoma.
   The defense chief, Col. Joe Theodore, said Bakr had agreed to
surrender Tuesday night, four days after the siege began.
   ``I just think they were worn down,'' he said of the rebels.
``They just wanted out. They had come to the conclusion they had
failed.''
   The defense chief said the rebels had agreed to leave all their
explosives and ammunition on the speaker's table in the Parliament
building.
   Officials said the rebels had been armed with AK-47 assault
rifles, vintage World War II rifles, pump-action shotguns, pistols
and grenades.
   The coup attempt began Friday when armed rebels stormed the
state television station and the Parliament building, taking top
government officials and others captive. They also bombed and
burned down the police station.
   The attack set off a wave of looting.
   Hundreds of people took to the streets, ransacking stores and
warehouses and carrying away everything from food to television
sets. Damage was estimated at $50 million and food and medicine
were beginning to run short. It was the country's worst violence
since a black power uprising in the early 1970s.
   Dookeran said a state of emergency, including the islandwide
curfew, would remain in effect until the country gets back to
normal.

<HEAD>With PM-US-Iraq-Kuwait</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate today gave President Bush an extra
month's authority to begin pumping oil from the nation's Strategic
Petroleum Reserve into the market should Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
disrupt world oil supplies.
   On a voice vote, the Senate passed a temporary extension of the
Energy Policy Conservation Act that established the
580-million-barrel rainy-day stockpile of unrefined crude oil in
response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
   Without the extension, Bush's authority to start pumping oil
from the reserve would have expired Aug. 15, while Congress is on
vacation.
   ``The events in the Middle East today underscore once again the
fragility of the economies of the Western world and the marginal
supply of energy that fuels it,'' said Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho.
   The stockpile, located in salt caverns along the Louisiana-Texas
coast, contains oil worth $20 billion.
   The administration and Congress have been battling for the past
18 months over whether to increase the stockpile's size to 1
billion barrels. Bush opposes the increase.
   ``The least we can do is to preserve the most important tool
that we have constructed so far,'' McClure said. ``It is important
... to take this emergency action on a temporary extension while we
try to resolve larger policy questions.''
   The system could now replace 80 days of oil imports, according
to the Senate Energy Committee. That cushion has fallen from 110
days in the middle 1980s because of growing U.S. dependence on
foreign crude.

   The House Foreign Affairs Committee, endorsing
President Bush's move for an economic embargo against Iraq,
convened hastily today to begin writing the White House sanctions
into law.
   The Senate, meanwhile, extended by a month the president's
authority to begin pumping oil from the nation's 580-million-barrel
Strategic Petroleum Reserve into the market should the invasion
disrupt world oil supplies.
   But some members of Congress criticized the administration,
saying there had been ``a total misjudgment of the policies and
goals'' of Iraqi President Haddam Hussein prior to Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   ``We have no intention of doing anything but codifying the
president's executive order,'' said House Foreign Affairs Committee
Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla. ``We want to indicate through
legislation that we are in full support of the president's action.''
   The panel was seeking to rewrite legislation it approved a day
earlier that would have cut off Iraq's $200 million a year in
Export-Import Bank credits and tightened restrictions on U.S.
exports which could have dual civilian and military uses.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said the chamber would pass the
measure later in the day. ``It is a matter of gravest concern to
the United States government,'' he said.
   Foley said it was too early to say what, if any, steps the
nation should take militarily. ``Obviously, the United States has
to keep all of its options open,'' he said. He refused to criticize
Bush for opposing earlier sanctions against Iraq, saying it would
be ``foolish'' to think they would have prevented the invasion.
   But Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., accused the Bush administration
of a ``policy of appeasement'' prior to the invasion which had
emboldened Saddam.
   ``There was a total misjudgment of the policies and goals of
Saddam Hussein to the very moment his troops invaded a neighboring
country,'' Lantos said.
   On a voice vote, the Senate passed a temporary extension of the
Energy Policy Conservation Act that established the stockpile of
unrefined crude oil in response to the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo.
   Bush's authority to begin pumping oil from the reserve located
in salt caverns along the Louisiana-Texas coast would have expired
August 15, while Congress is on vacation, without the extension.
   ``It's clear the president has responded boldly and
comprehensively'' in severing exports and imports, and in freezing
assets of Iraq and Kuwait in the United States, said Rep. Stephen
Solarz, D-N.Y. He said it was important that Congress and the
administration speak with one voice in condemning Iraq's action.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., said: ``Many have been urging this
administration to take Saddam Hussein much more seriously than they
have.''
   The author of the original sanctions bill, Rep. Howard Berman,
D-Calif., said the Reagan administration had begun the policy when
it ``tilted'' toward Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran and
urged allies to provide military equipment to the Baghdad
government, overlooking that regime's support for terrorism and its
human rights violations.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he would not rule out
military action, perhaps in cooperation with other countries in the
region, to deal with the threat from Iraq.
   ``You're dealing with a madman here,'' Dodd said of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. ``I'm not sure he's going to respond to
sanctions.'' He said he believed that military moves will be
necessary ``at some point'' because the invasion ``poses a
significant and very real threat to the entire region.''
   Dodd, like many others on Capitol Hill, compared Saddam to
Hitler: ``There was another time in this century when we've watched
the first actions of a madman and said, `sooner or later they'll be
satisfied.' Well, I don't believe they will be.''
   Added Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.: ``You're talking about
something that could totally unravel the whole Middle East. Talk
about the analogy of the fuse being lit, it's being lit in Kuwait.''

<HEAD>American Peace Corps Worker Released After 50 Days in Rebel Hands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Peace Corps worker freed
Thursday after being held 50 days by Communist rebels said he was
tired, happy and eager to get home.
   Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, Wyo., was handed over to a Red
Cross team in a rural area on the central Philippine island of
Negros, not far from where he was abducted on June 13.
   ``It's just great. It's just wonderful news,'' Swanson's father,
Leonard Swanson, told radio station KRAE in Cheyenne after learning
of his son's release.
   ``You feel like a whole big weight has been taken off,'' said
his mother, Lynn Swanson.
   President Bush, who met briefly with Swanson's parents when he
visited Cheyenne on July 20, called Thursday morning with his best
wishes, they said.
   ``I'm tired, I'm very happy,'' Swanson told reporters after his
release. ``They treated me well. I'm OK and I want to go home.''
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt welcomed Swanson's release,
saying the embassy is ``relieved that he is safe, unharmed, and
apparently in good health.''
   The United States ordered the evacuation of Peace Corps workers
in the Philippines on June 27 because intelligence information
indicated the Communist rebels might try to kill or kidnap them.
   By that time, Swanson was already in rebel hands, but his
Filipino wife said she had been ordered by the rebels not to tell
anyone. Swanson had been living and working in the remote mountain
village of Patag, about 320 miles southeast of Manila.
   U.S. officials said they learned of Swanson's abduction on June
30 when they tried to contact him.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said Swanson probably
would stay in Manila for a few days and then leave for the United
States.
   Earlier Thursday, the New People's Army rebels freed Fumio
Mizuno, a Japanese aid worker who had been held since May 29.
Mizuno, of the Organization of Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural
Advancement, appeared in good health.
   Rebels said they seized the two because their organizations were
suspected of supporting the Philippine government's
counter-insurgency campaign. Relief organizations have denied any
such involvement.
   The New People's Army has been waging a 21-year insurgency to
establish a Marxist state.
   The incident caused some strain in U.S.-Philippine ties. When
the pullout of Peace Corps workers was ordered, some Philippines
officials complained that the action was too hasty and said they
should have been consulted first.
   Then, after the abduction was disclosed, U.S. officials said it
proved their intelligence information had been correct.
   In Cheyenne, Swanson's mother said she was planning to bake
rhubarb pie and stock up on steaks to celebrate her son's
homecoming.
   ``He'll be well-fed when he gets home, I can guarantee that,''
she said.

   A former astronaut, two former congressmen and
an ex-administrator of NASA are among 11 people named to a new
federal commission to study the future of America's space program,
Vice President Quayle's office announced Thursday.
   The panel, called the Advisory Committee on the Future of the
U.S. Space Program, was organized by NASA and by the Space Council,
which Quayle directs, after the space agency's recent problems with
a flawed space telescope and with hydrogen leaks that grounded the
shuttle fleet.
   The purpose of the committee, officials said, is to provide an
independent evaluation of the civil space program, assess how the
program is being operated by NASA and to make recommendations on
future directions in space.
   Norman R. Augustine, the chairman and chief executive officer of
Martin Marietta Corp., was named chairman of the committee last
week.
   Committee members announced Thursday are:
   Laurel L. Wilkening, provost of the University of Washington,
Seattle, and a former member of an earlier space commission.
   Edward C. Aldridge Jr., president of McDonnell Douglas
Electronics Systems Corp., and a former secretary of the Air Force.
   Joseph P. Allen, former astronaut and president of Space
Industries International Inc.
   D. James Baker, scientist and president of Join Oceanographic
Institutions.
   Edward P. Boland, former congressman from Massachusetts.
   Daniel J. Fink, retired vice president of General Electric Co.
   Don Fuqua, former congressman from Florida and now president of
the Aerospace Industries Association of America, an industry
organization.
   Robert T. Herres, retired Air Force general and former commander
of the U.S. Space Command.
   David T. Kerns, chairman of the Xerox Corp.
   Louis J. Lanzerotti, scientist and chairman of the space studies
board of the National Research Council, an organization of the
National Academy of Sciences.
   Thomas O. Paine, former NASA administrator and chairman of an
earlier commission on space.
   Though the panel is to operate independently, it will submit its
findings directly to NASA administrator Richard Truly and to
Quayle. The committee is to make its report within four months.

   U.S. Rep. Floyd Flake was indicted today for
conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion in the alleged embezzlement of
funds from a federally subsidized senior citizens housing project
run by his church.
   The indictment, announced by U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney,
listed 17 counts against the New York Democrat and nine against his
wife, described as the bookkeeper for the operation.
   In addition to his congressional duties, Flake is the pastor of
the 156-year-old Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in
Queens. The church built and operates the 300-unit senior citizen
facility.
   Maloney told a news conference that Flake stole about $75,000 in
transportation funds from the Allen Senior Citizens Apartments from
1983 to 1987, and diverted another $66,000 in church funds to his
own use from 1983 to 1988.
   The allegedly misappropriated money was not reported by Flake on
federal income tax returns, Maloney said.
   ``The defendants' conduct deprived the senior citizens, whom
they were pledged to protect, of the federal funds specifically
designated for their care,'' Maloney said.
   The church built the 300-unit senior citizen facility with a $10
million grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
HUD also provides $100,000 a month in subsidies for operations,
Maloney said.
   Flake, in a statement, said he had cooperated fully with the
government in an 18-month investigation and expected to be
acquitted.
   ``The prosecutor has decided to charge me, basically, with tax
violations which he has attempted to bolster with allegations of
misapplying a portion of the transportation expenses,'' Flake said.
   Flake said he and his wife, Margarett, were both innocent.
   ``Our abiding belief in God and in the American system of
justice reassures us that, despite the awful price, justice will
triumph and we will be vindicated at trial,'' Flake said.
   The charges included one count of conspiracy, two of HUD fraud
and six of tax evasion against each of the two defendants. In
addition, Flake is charged with another four counts of filing false
tax returns and four of making false financial statements.
   If convicted on all 17 counts, Flake could be sentenced to a
maximum of 87 years in prison and fined up to $3.95 million. His
wife could face penalties of 55 years in prison and fines of up to
$2.1 million.

<TEXT>
   Scores of detectives and hundreds of police
officers spread out across the city in anticipation of a fifth
attack by the Zodiac killer this morning, but the
astrology-obsessed gunman did not strike.
   The pre-dawn hours of this morning were considered a target
night for the gunman, based on his pattern of striking on early
Thursdays at 21-day intervals or multiples thereof.
   Today marked 42 days since the gunman's last attack, on a
homeless man sleeping on a Central Park bench. It is also in the
sign of Leo, believed to be the astrological sign of the gunman's
next victim.
   The gunman has sent six letters to police and the media,
threatening to kill 12 people, one for each astrological sign.
Since March 8, he has shot four men, one of them fatally.
   In anticipation, police officials reactivated ``Operation
Watchdog,'' flooding the streets with undercover officers, just as
they did on July 12, when the gunman was also expected to strike,
but didn't.
   The gunman's long silence has made it difficult for the 50
investigators assigned to the Zodiac task force to develop new
leads. Detectives have followed as many as 2,900 calls to a 24-hour
hotline without success.
   Investigators predicted that the next target night for the
gunman would be Aug. 23, in the sign of Virgo.

<HEAD>Barry's Lawyer Says Government Witnesses Were Facile Liars</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Combines pvs with editing.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marion Barry's lawyer described the mayor's
accusers today as ``facile liars'' and ``little Lucifers'' as he
urged that Barry be acquitted of all 14 criminal charges against
him.
   The government's exhaustive investigation of Barry's drug use
amounted to ``using a sledgehammer to kill a fly,'' defense
attorney R. Kenneth Mundy told the jury in closing arguments at the
mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   The jurors' verdict should be ``not guilty,'' Mundy told the
panel.
   If the government's witnesses, such as former model Rasheeda
Moore and admitted cocaine dealer Charles Lewis, weren't ``devils,
they were at least little Lucifers or small Satans,'' said Mundy.
   The witnesses were ``facile liars right here in your very
presence,'' he added.
   Mundy said the mayor has occasionally used cocaine. But he said
the government was not justified in pursuing Barry as vigorously as
it did.
   On Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin in her
closing argument called Barry a ``general in the war'' on drugs
``who was working with the other side.''
   Retchin, summarizing six weeks of trial testimony, told the jury
that Barry used drugs in ``every quadrant of this city for years''
and wrapped himself in a ``web of deception'' to cover it up.
   ``If Mr. Barry's drug use were so rampant, he could have been
discovered in a more traditional way,'' Mundy said. ``The cure is
many-fold worse than the ailment.''
   ``The government in effect used a sledgehammer to kill a fly,''
Mundy said, describing the lengthy investigation of the mayor that
culminated in Barry's Jan. 18 arrest in an undercover sting
operation.
   Mundy lashed out at government witnesses who testified against
Barry, contending they described the mayor using drugs only to save
themselves from prosecution.
   ``How trustworthy, how believable and credible is the testimony
of anyone under that kind of pressure?'' Mundy asked the jury.
``They are prosecuting him because he is the mayor.''
   Mundy, who began his presentation Wednesday, was concluding his
statement today, followed by a final argument by the prosecution.
The jury then will receive its instructions from U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, and begin deliberations.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 counts of cocaine
possession, three felony charges of lying to the grand jury and one
count of conspiracy. Each perjury count carries a maximum five-year
prison term.
   On Wednesday, Mundy said he was ``trying to gain the respect of
the jury'' by acknowledging that the mayor has used cocaine.
   ``I will start right from the beginning by telling you that Mr.
Barry used cocaine,'' he said. ``We do not intend to give you the
imression for one moment that there was not occasional drug use by
Mr. Barry.''
   But the government adopted the philosophy of ``the ends justify
the means'' to catch the mayor using drugs, Mundy argued.
``Everything that the government could amass against him was put
forward.''
   Retchin said a government sting operation at the Vista
International Hotel was necessary to expose Barry's drug use. The
mayor was arrested Jan. 18 after he was videotaped smoking
FBI-supplied crack cocaine in a hotel bedroom.
   Mundy accused federal authorities of using the equivalent of an
illegal war weapon to catch him using cocaine in the sting
operation.
   ``The danger of mustard gas _ which was the sting at the Vista _
is that it cuts at the very fabric of our society,'' the defense
attorney said. ``It might be Mr. Barry today, someone else
tomorrow.''
   Most of those who testified against Barry had no one to back up
their stories and could not provide much detail, Mundy said.
``There was very rarely a situation where there is corroborating
testimony about these things,'' he said.
   The three-term mayor denied he was involved with drugs in grand
jury testimony and in public statements, but Retchin said the sting
operation ``breaks the shield of secrecy.''
   The evidence is ``overwhelming'' that Barry relied on a ``close
group of friends'' to get him cocaine because they wanted city
jobs, city contracts and the power that comes with knowing the
mayor, the prosecutor said.
   She recounted testimony from 10 friends and associates of the
mayor who said they saw Barry use cocaine about 200 times from 1983
through Jan. 18.

   Kuwait's ambassador to the United States
appealed today for direct U.S. military intervention to repulse the
Iraqi forces he said are controlling his nation.
   ``We don't stand a chance if we don't get any aid from our
friends,'' Ambassador Saud Nasser Al-Sabah told reporters at a
press briefing at the embassy.
   Asked what type of help he wanted, the ambassador replied: ``I'm
talking about military intervention. ... U.S. intervention at this
stage is of paramount importance.''
   Hours later, Iraq's ambassador, Mohamed Sadiq Al-Mashat,
summoned reporters to his embassy where he said any foreign
interference ``will only aggravate the situation.''
   Despite Kuwait's protestations, Al-Mashat said the ``events
currently occurring in Kuwait are an internal affair'' and that
Iraq ``harbors no special objectives in Kuwait.''
   Iraq, he said, ``is desirous of establishing relations of
fraternity and good neighborliness with it.''
   Standing in front of a life-sized picture of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, Al-Mashat read a prepared statement but refused to
answer questions.
   Bush told reporters at an early morning news conference at the
White House that he was not considering taking military steps.
   ``The United States strongly condemns the Iraqi military
invasion of Kuwait and calls for the immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of all the Iraqi forces,'' Bush said.
   Sources at the Pentagon said the aircraft carrier USS
Independence was en route to the Persian Gulf to bolster U.S.
forces there. However, the sources said the carrier would not enter
the Gulf.
   Ambassador Al-Sabah, speaking in a somber tone, said that Kuwait
was ``under occupation'' by a belligerent power.
   He said that he had talked within the last 30 minutes to members
of the ruling family who he said were in good health and ``in a
safe place to conduct the resistance that is taking place inside.''
   Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, is directing the
resistance from Saudi Arabia, the ambassador said.
   He said all Kuwait government facilities, including the ministry
buildings, had been occupied by the Iraqis, who are heading toward
the southern part of the country, where the oil installations are
located.
   Al-Sabah gave only sketchy details of the resistance and of the
situation on the ground, but he said there were numerous
casualties. He had no estimates and said the State Department had
been told there were no Americans at risk.
   Al-Sabah said he was in touch with officials both at the State
Department and at the White House and had relayed his requests for
assistance to them.
   Administration officials were weighing the request but had not
responded, he said.
   Kuwait, Al-Sabah said, would be willing to accept help from
other countries.
   ``We are desperate for any help we can get,'' he said,
describing it as a ``universal cry for help.''
   Al-Sabah said bitterly that his government had been assured by
other powers that Iraq would not follow through with its menacing
threats of the last week. The United States was among those
countries that reassured Kuwait, he said, noting that they had been
proved wrong.
   The Arab nations are holding an emergency meeting in Cairo to
discuss the situation.

   A week of festivities beginning Friday will mark

one-mile segment through downtown Phoenix partly covered with a
park.
   The official opening is set for Aug. 10, but the celebration
begins a week earlier with what is billed as a freeway ``open

   That will include tours of ``the deck,'' a half-mile section
that is depressed below surface level and covered with a deck that
is being buried under a thick layer of soil for a park.
   It cost over $55 million to build the deck-tunnel, and lighting
and other environmental features inside the tunnel cost $20 million.
   The festivities will include foot races, fireworks, parades,
antique cars and a black-tie dinner, with music by the Phoenix
Symphony, on the evening of Aug. 9.

   Here is the text of a statement released
by the Provisional Government of Free Kuwait, which Iraq claims
took power in Kuwait before the Iraqi invasion. The statement was
carried by the French service of the official Iraqi News Agency and
translated by The Associated Press.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Since the dawn of independence the sons of Kuwait have aspired
to freedom, to participation, with their Arab brothers, in the
realization of the goals of the nation and the recuperation of
usurped Arab rights, especially in Palestine.
   But the colonialists who had governed the country, plundered its
riches and humiliated the people before independence either
directly or through the intermediary of their agents _ certain
members of the al-Sabah family _ handed the reins of power to that
same clique after independence, letting them set up around their
family an oligarchic, despotic and corrupt power.
   The fictitious institutions that this regime installed were not
able to camouflage its reality, which the people divined right from
the first minute.
   As the years went by, the people became more and more convinced
that this clique was determined to pursue its monopolization of
power and its plundering of the riches of the country by
collaborating with a small number of mercenaries, relying
principally on foreign forces.
   Falsification of elections, authoritarianism, persecution of
patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the
regime of the al-Sabah family, and of its stability. The
dissolution of the last Parliament, which put the despotism and the
corruption of the regime under the limelight, is a proof of the
violation by this regime of the constitution and of the terrorism
to which it had recourse every time it was cornered by the patriots.
   This clique, which was in the service of foreigners before
independence, remained so after independence. It attached our
interests and our wealth to foreign interests and even to certain
known Zionists. It stained the reputation of our people, putting
hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign banks and in investments
linked to Zionist circles.
   Some of them (in the al-Sabah family) were known for their
intransigence and corruption, and were among the most faithful men
of colonialism. They collaborated and coordinated with it, they
intrigued and plotted in the vilest, basest manner, against the
nation and its noble causes.
   Their last conspiracy was the one they hatched against Iraq,
which assumed its responsibility to defend the eastern gateway of
the Arab nation _ Kuwait and the countries of the Persian Gulf _
and suffered tremendous sacrifices to conserve their soil, honor
and dignity.
   In this conspiracy with Zionist and colonialist aims, this
al-Sabah family clique pulled off its mask, manifesting its
hostility to Kuwait and the (Arab) nation, like a satellite in the
pay of colonialism and Zionism.
   This is the reality of this clique that governed the country,
this is why the patriotic forces _ which rejected despotism,
injustice and corruption and resisted this regime attached to
Zionist and colonialist circles _ decided, relying on God's will
and the will of the people, to assume power and topple this
despotic, satellite regime.
   We declare the destitution from power of (Emir) Jaber al-Ahmed
al-Sabah and (Crown Prince) Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, as well as
the dissolution of the National Assembly, and the formation of a
free provisional government that will assume legislative and
executive responsibilities during a transitional period, and will
organize free, honest elections in order to elect an assembly that
represents the people, which will decide on a political system and
other fundamental questions of the country.
   The government finds that one of its primary obligations is to
remedy the harm done by the deposed, corrupt government to our
brothers in Iraq, which backed us under difficult circumstances.
   We consider the border issue with Iraq by appealing to the
principles of fraternity and Arab national interests.
   Dear free citizens, on this day a new era begins, an era of
serious action aimed at setting up the bases of freedom, democracy
and justice, as well as true prosperity throughout society. Serious
action is beginning to serve the objectives of the Arab nation and
deal with its fundamental issues.
   The Provisional Government of Free Kuwait salutes you and calls
on you to understand and sustain this uprising carried out by your
free brothers.
   The Provisional Government of Free Kuwait undertakes to protect
the rights, interests and security of foreigners living in Kuwait
and calls on them to carry out all the decisions and instructions
issued by the government. It will hit back vigorously against any
attempt to destabilize the situation in Kuwait, or to carry out the
plans of foreign forces.
   The Provisional Government of Free Kuwait confirms its
allegiance to all treaties in accordance with its Arab, Islamic and
world role, in particular the charter of the Arab League, the
treaty on common defense and economic cooperation among Arab
countries and the charter of the United Nations, as well as the
charter of the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Gulf
Cooperation Council.
   The government confirms it will respect all accords concluded
with other nations except any secret accords that are in
contradiction with our sovereignty and our national, pan-Arab
engagements, and following the principle of reciprocity.
   The government also confirms its attachment to all financial
engagements vis-a-vis other countries and institutions, and this
following the principle of reciprocity. It confirms it will carry
out all reciprocal agreements and warns any foreign party not to
interference in our internal affairs.
   Foreign forces allied with the expelled caste should know that
the citizens of Kuwait, including Arabs residing in this country,
will defend its soil, its dignity and its uprising to the last drop
of their blood. They will never surrender to foreign attempts at
intimidation and threats.
   In this framework the people of Kuwait and the Provisional
Government of Free Kuwait will reject any cover that might be used
to excite the ambitions of suspect forces wanting to intervene
directly or indirectly, be it by their armies, their fleets or by
any other means. These forces should know that Kuwait is part of
the Arab nation and has at its side audacious, experienced brothers
who are ready to defend Kuwait against any foreign aggression.

   ``Those victims, whether a `downwinder' receiving radiation
fallout from nuclear devices detonated in Nevada, or miners digging
uranium, will now be eligible for compensation,'' said Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, the bill's sponsor.
   The White House initially had opposed the bill, and the Justice
Department was concerned that claims would be handled by the U.S.
Claims Court rather than the department.
   But Hatch told a news conference that ``as late as last night I
was told they would not oppose this bill.''
   Under the legislation, a person who was harmed while standing
downwind of the government's atomic test site in Nevada in the
1950s and 1960s could receive a one-time damage award of $50,000.
   Damages would be for injury or death to the victim.
   A uranium miner who was unwittingly exposed to harmful doses of
ionizing radiation from 1947 to 1971 would be entitled to a
one-time damage award of $100,000.
   To qualify for damages, claimants must be residents of specified
areas and have suffered certain types of cancer, including leukemia
and lymphomas.
   Hatch and Sens. Alan Simpson, D-Wyo.; Harry Reid, D-Nev., and
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said it would be difficult for the White
House to oppose the legislation.
   ``This is a bill that gallops through the place,'' said Simpson,
the Senate Republican whip. He said the bill was ``compassionate,
it provides an apology.''
   ``The government has finally admitted negligence,'' Hatch said.
``We've fought through layers of red tape for years, through
litigation, reversals and years of pain suffered by those people
who lived through the horrors of a death they could not see:
radiation.''

<HEAD>Factory Orders Slump For Third Time This Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
slumped in June for the third time this year, the government said
Thursday. The report added to analysts' fears of a possible
recession that were intensified by rising oil prices resulting from
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The economy is walking on a precipice and doesn't need
something to come up and give it a shove,'' said Robert G.
Dederick, chief economist with the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Shortly after the Iraqi army pushed into neighboring Kuwait, oil
prices soared amid fears the invasion would reduce the world's oil
supply. At the same time, the Commerce Department reported a 1.5
percent drop in orders for both durable and non-durable factory
goods, more evidence of economic weakness.
   ``We're in a precarious position, on the edge of a recession,''
said Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the WEFA group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. ``With the problems in the Middle East and the threat
of higher oil prices, that may be just enough to push us over.''
   On the other hand, Chairman Michael Boskin of President Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers contended that a 25 percent hike in
oil prices could be absorbed by the economy without halting its
growth.
   ``Even if the higher price is enforced, our economy today is
much better able to absorb modest price increases,'' Boskin told
the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
   Iraq and Kuwait produce one-fifth of the total oil produced by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and their oil
accounts for an estimated 5 percent of daily U.S. consumption.
   In its report on factory orders, the Commerce Department said
the decline was concentrated in durable goods _ big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years. They fell 2.8 percent to
$125.1 billion after a 2.2 percent advance a month earlier.
Non-durable orders were flat at $112.3 billion.
   Dederick noted that factory orders have bounced up and down
throughout the first half of the year and, as a result, the
manufacturing sector ``is really just spinning its wheels.''
   Orders plummeted 5.5 percent in January _ the sharpest drop
since a 7.0 percent decrease in December 1974. They then rose 1.8
percent in February and 4.0 percent in March before dropping 2.1 in
April. Orders were up 2.2 percent in May.
   And as orders decline, industry tends to cut production and
jobs. In fact, the Labor Department reported earlier the loss of
31,000 factory jobs in June.
   Because many factory items, particularly durable goods, are
purchased through loans, the manufacturing sector has borne the
brunt of high interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve as
its sought to slow the economy to dampen inflationary pressures.
   But even if the higher oil prices do not jolt the economy into
recession, they will tend to drive up overall living costs and
hamper the central bank's anti-inflation efforts.
   The factory orders report did contain at least one hopeful sign,
a 0.6 percent gain, to $36.1 billion, in the key category of
non-defense capital goods. This barometer of business investment
plans had fallen 1.8 percent in May.
   Over half of the durables decline was in defense goods, which
dropped 20.3 percent to $8.0 billion. Excluding defense, orders
would have dropped 0.7 percent.

   The Soviet announcement about suspending arms sales came shortly
after Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Siberia and asked him to
immediately halt arms deliveries to Iraq. The two leaders were
meeting to discuss Afghanistan and other issues.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement earlier today condemning
the Iraqi attack and calling for an immediate withdrawal of all
Iraqi troops, but the Tass report contained the first response to
Baker's request.
   The brief Tass announcement said sales of arms and military
hardware were being interrupted ``in connection with the invasion
of Kuwait by Iraqi armed forces.''

<HEAD>Senate Passes $21 Billion Energy and Water Project Measure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate passed a spending bill Thursday
that includes full funding for a huge atom smasher in Texas and
nearly $3 billion for a new program to clean up nuclear
contamination from weapons plants.
   The $20.8 billion spending measure also contains hundreds of
millions for water projects in the home states of senators who put
together the package. The measure, which increases spending over
this year's level by $2.5 billion, must be reconciled with the
version that the House passed in June.
   The Senate version _ almost exactly the same as the House total
_ exceeds the administration request by nearly $600 million. It was
passed by a voice vote.
   The bill contains $318 million in 1991 for the Texas-based
Superconducting Super Collider project, the same amount requested
by the administration and granted by the House. Current estimates
put the final cost for the collider at nearly $9 billion when it is
completed in 1998. The circular project would be 54 miles long and
would be the world's largest atom smasher. An estimate three years
ago put the cost at $4.4 billion.
   The 1991 appropriation includes construction funds.
   More than half the money in the Senate bill is set aside for
defense-related nuclear projects. The bulk of that money goes to
nuclear weapons research and production, including $107 million for
Star Wars.
   The defense component also includes $2.7 billion to clean up
contamination at the nation's nuclear defense plants. The amount is
$318 million more than the administration requested and $34 million
less than what the House voted to spend.
   Estimates put the ultimate cleanup cost at $50 billion to $200
billion over the next two decades.
   The Senate bill also calls for spending more than half a billion
dollars on civilian nuclear waste management, only slightly
exceeding the administration request.
   The bill contains $5 billion worth of water projects, including
$63 million more than the administration requested for Louisiana
alone. Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., is chairman of the
appropriations subcommittee that put together the bill.

<TEXT>
   An advocacy group for the elderly on Thursday
said Medicare cuts under consideration by federal budget
negotiators would hit the nation's sickest and poorest senior
citizens the hardest.
   Families USA, a non-profit advocacy group, called the proposal
to raise Medicare premiums and deductibles ``a wolf in sheep's
clothing'' that was being advanced because it was politically more
acceptable than cutting Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.
   The group analyzed three proposals to reduce spending on senior
citizens that are under consideration by budget negotiators for the
Bush administration and Congress.
   The 12-week-old budget talks are aimed at producing a
deficit-reduction package. One plan under consideration would
increase the Medicare deductible on payments to physicians from $75
to $150, and raise monthly premium rates.
   Phyllis Torda, health policy director for Families USA, said the
Medicare cutbacks would cost elderly beneficiaries 20 percent more
in 1995 than a one-year freeze in Social Security COLAs, but would
be less risky politically.
   ``Raising the cost of Medicare is nothing more than a Social
Security COLA cut in disguise,'' she said.
   A third option under consideration would increase taxes on
Social Security income for senior citizens with annual incomes of
$40,000 or more. Families USA said this plan was the fairest of the
three proposals.
   Torda said the release of the group's report was timed to
coincide with the August congressional recess.
   ``We think that while Congress is in recess, work will be going
on on the package,'' said Torda. ``Now is the time to influence the
shape of that package.''

   An Army commando who escaped police
custody while being taken to court in a rape case was recaptured
early today, authorities said.
   Master Sgt. Marshall L. Brown, who faces life in prison if
convicted on charges he raped two Cranston women last year, was
captured by police in a stolen car in an East Providence parking
lot. He was unarmed.
   Brown, 37, has been a Green Beret, a Ranger and, most recently a
member of the Delta Force, the secret anti-terrorist group. He took
part in the failed raid to free U.S. hostages from Iran.
   Brown escaped Monday after freeing himself from handcuffs while
being taken from a jail to the courthouse for a hearing on the rape
charges.
   Attorney General James O'Neil said Brown would be arraigned
today on escape and auto theft charges.
   Officials said state police had received a tip from a
confidential source that Brown could be found in the parking lot.
   ``Two of our undercover detectives were parked in the parking
lot and observed Brown hiding in bushes,'' said state police Lt.
Brian Andrews. ``He came out of the bushes, crept very slowly along
the ground and got in what turned out to be a stolen car.''
   State police detectives grabbed him before he could leave the
parking lot, Andrews said.
   Even if Brown had been armed, Andrews said, ``We hit that car so
fast he didn't even have time to reach for a gun.''
   Brown, of Spring Lake, N.C., was attending a nine-week course at
the Naval Education and Training Center in Newport when Cranston
police arrested him on June 11, 1989.
   He also has been charged with two rapes in North Carolina, where
he was a member of the Army Special Forces stationed at Fort Bragg.

   The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier, said
today it will suspend weapons sales to Baghdad, and the United
States blocked most Iraqi imports as part of a worldwide
condemnation of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   President Bush signed orders freezing Iraqi assets and Kuwaiti
assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them. France quickly did the
same, while Britain froze Kuwaiti assets.
   In Moscow, the Tass news agency quoted th Foreign Ministry as
saying Soviet arms sales to Iraq were being suspended. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III had requested this today, after Iraqi
troops crossed into Kuwait.
   The Arab League Council met in emergency session in Cairo but
issued no immediate statement. At the meeting, Lebanese Premier
Salim Hoss urged the League to condemn the invasion.
   Iraq overran Kuwait after talks broke down Wednesday on a
dispute over an oil-rich border area.
   The U.N. Security Council met in emergency session and voted
14-0 to condemn the attack. It demanded the unconditional
withdrawal of the Iraqi troops.
   Kuwait's U.S. ambassador, Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, appealed
for military help from the United States and urged the Arab League
to dispatch a peacekeeping force.
   But the Arab League's U.S. ambassador, Clovis Maksoud, urged
world powers to abstain from intervening. Jordan's official news
agency said King Hussein also hoped to prevent foreign intervention.
   ``We're not discussing intervention,'' President Bush told
reporters in Washington but added that he would not discuss
military options in public.
   A Pentagon source said a U.S. naval battle group was diverted
toward the gulf from the Arabian Ocean.
   Bush signed orders freezing all Iraqi property in the United
States and blocking almost all imports from the oil-rich Middle
Eastern country, including its most important revenue source _ oil.
He also froze Kuwaiti property under U.S. jurisdiction to keep Iraq
from seizing it.
   In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Britain was doing
the same. Kuwait is estimated to have $100 billion in foreign
investments, including stakes of about 10 percent in British
Petroleum and Britain's Midland Bank.
   The Swiss government told the nation's banks to increase
vigilance over Kuwaiti assets to prevent their seizure by Iraq.
   In Moscow, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Belonogov called in
the Iraqi ambassador and expressed hope his country would comply
with the U.N. resolution, the Tass news agency said.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said, ``The
sovereignty, national independence and territorial integrity of the
state of Kuwait must be fully restored and safeguarded,'' according
to Tass.
   France, Iraq's No. 2 arms supplier, issued a ``total and
unreserved condemnation of the intervention of Iraqi troops in
Kuwait,'' and demanded an immediate withdrawal. The government
halted international capital transactions ``of any nature''
involving Iraqi or Kuwaiti accounts, the prime minister's office
said in a communique.
   The 12 European Community nations meeting in Brussels strongly
condemned Iraq but did not immediately adopt economic sanctions or
freeze Iraqi assets in the trade bloc.
   Also in Brussels, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization called
the Iraqi military aggression a ``clear violation of the charter of
the United Nations.'' Israel's defense minister, Moshe Arens, said
Israel expected more aggressive actions from Iraq and was ready to
meet any threat posed by the Arab nation.
   Avi Pazner, the spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
said the invasion confirms Israel's warnings that Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's threats should be taken seriously.
   Saddam had threatened military action against Kuwait for its
overproduction of oil, which had driven down prices for Iraq's oil.
   China described Iraq and Kuwait as ``friends,'' and said there
was ``no conflict of fundamental interests among Third World
countries and that no one should resort to force of arms in
resolving their disputes.''
   Australia condemned ``any Iraqi violation of Kuwait's
territorial intergrity.''
   Japan, which gets more than 10 percent of oil from the two
countries, called for the immediate withdrawal of Iraq's forces.
Japan imports 99 percent of its oil needs and its economy has
proved vulnerable to ``oil shocks'' emanating from Middle East
conflicts.
   The Arab oil embargo after the 1973 Arab-Israeli War was a
powerful though short-term setback to Japan's economic growth as
oil prices skyrocketed, causing inflation and cutbacks in
industrial production.
   West Germany demanded an ``immediate and unconditional''
withdrawal of the forces that stormed Kuwait's northern border
before dawn today.
   Libya's Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning against
foreign intervention, the official JANA news agency reported.
   ``Foreign intervention on the part of imperialist powers is
something which we utterly reject because the Arabs are capable of
resolving their problems on their own,'' the Libyan statement said.
   Norwegian Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik urged maximum
international pressure to end the dispute. In Singapore, the
Foreign Affairs Ministry said the invasion was ``a threat to the
security of small states everywhere.''
   Some members of the U.S. Congress criticized the administration
for not acting earlier against Saddam.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., accused the Bush administration of a
``policy of appeasement'' prior to the invasion and said this had
emboldened Saddam.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said the Reagan administration
began the policy when it ``tilted'' toward Iraq during its
eight-year war with Iran and urged allies to provide military
equipment to the Baghdad government.

<TEXT>
   Peace Corps volunteers will return to the
Philippines when their safety can be assured, the corps director
said after the release Thursday of a corpsman detained for 50 days
by Filipino communist guerrillas.
   Timothy Swanson, a 26-year-old volunteer from Cheyenne, Wyo.,
was released by New People's Army insurgents and he appeared to be
physically unharmed, said corps director Paul Coverdell.
   The program's suspension June 27 was not intended to be
permanent, and ``I think there are valid reasons for us to begin
discussions to find a way volunteers can return to that country in
safety,'' Coverdell said.
   However, he said, ``Until we can verify that safety, they cannot
return.'' He did not list specific conditions.
   U.S. officials suspended the Philippines program after learning
that the New People's Army had targeted volunteers for attack.
Manila headquarters did not learn Swanson had been abducted from
his home in Negros province on June 13 until it summoned
participants to return to America two weeks later.
   The reason for the kidnapping remains unknown, Coverdell said.
   The Peace Corps began Philippine operations 30 years ago. Until
it abducted Swanson, the New People's Army left all foreign
volunteers alone, Coverdell said.
   Their release of Swanson and of Fumio Mizuno, a detained member
of a Japanese service organization, may suggest that they have
reverted to the earlier hands-off policy, he said, but ``it is too
early to know as yet.''
   Meanwhile, more time will be needed to activate a Peace Corps
program planned for China but canceled after the June 1989
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, Coverdell said.
   Discussions have resumed with the Chinese government, but funds
for the program were diverted to other uses when the plans were
canceled, he said.
   The first Peace Corps volunteers will go to Mongolia next year
under an agreement signed by Secretary of State James Baker III in
Ulan Bator, Coverdell said.

   A suit filed today seeks to stop the
Legislature from considering a proposed measure that would require
unmarried girls 17 and younger to get a parent's consent for an
abortion.
   The suit filed by Zolton Ferency, a state Senate candidate,
maintained that the proposal is unconstitutional and asks that the
Board of State Canvassers be prohibited from sending the initiative
to the Legislature.
   ``I'm saying the right to keep your body healthy, the right to
seek medical care when you need it, is a fundamental right nobody
can interfere with,'' Ferency said.
   But Barbara Listing, president of Right to Life of Michigan,
said the legal challenge is premature since the measure has not
been acted on. She said Ferency, one of two Democrats running for a
vacant state Senate seat in next Tuesday's primary, filed the suit
to help his campaign.
   ``It's a rather frivolous suit and a publicity stunt right
before a contested primary in which he's a candidate,'' she said.
   The lawsuit, filed in Ingham County Circuit Court, targets a
measure being pushed by the Right to Life of Michigan group, which
gathered more than 333,000 signatures on petitions to put the
proposal before the Legislature.
   If the Board of State Canvassers certifies the petitions, the
Legislature will have 40 days to pass the measure or it will go
before voters in the 1992 general election.
   Gov. James Blanchard, who vetoed a similar measure earlier this
year, is barred by the state constitution from doing so to
initiated bills.
   Ferency's suit relies on a section of the Michigan Constitution
that says the people's power to initiate legislation covers only
laws that are constitutional.
   Ferency argued that the bill is unconstitutional because it
treats unmarried minors differently from married minors and
interferes with the right to seek medical care.
   It also unconstitutionally violates the due process rights of
doctors by punishing them for performing a legal medical procedure
and interferes with a contract between a doctor and a patient for
medical care by requiring a third party's consent, Ferency's suit
argued.

   The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier,
decided today to suspend weapons sales to Iraq in response to
Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait, the official Tass news agency said.
   At the same time, the United States said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III would travel to Moscow on Friday to issue a
joint superpower statement on the invasion, which Washington and
the Soviet Union both condemned.
   The Soviet announcement about arms sales came several hours
after the Soviet Union demanded that Iraq withdraw its troops from
Kuwait.
   Iraq's forces overran Kuwait after talks broke down Wednesday on
a dispute over an oil-rich border area.
   Earlier today, Baker met with Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze in Siberia and asked him to halt arms deliveries to
Iraq. The two leaders were in the Siberian city of Irkutsk to
discuss Afghanistan and other issues.
   After Tass reported the suspension of arms sales, the State
Department announced that Baker had changed his travel plans and
would fly to Moscow on Friday to issue the joint statement with
Shevardnadze on the Iraqi invasion.
   The fact that the Soviet Union and the United States both moved
together against Iraq shows how their relationship has improved and
how both seem less prepared to take opposite sides in regional
conflicts.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement this morning
condemning the Iraqi attack and calling for an immediate withdrawal
of all Iraqi troops, but the brief Tass report tonight contained
the first response to Baker's request.
   Tass, which was quoting a second Foreign Ministry statement,
said sales of arms and military hardware were being interrupted
``in connection with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi armed forces.''
   It was the latest in a series of quick responses by governments
that have condemned the Iraqi invasion, which toppled the Kuwaiti
government and put a provisional government in its place.
   President Bush, who condemned the invasions as ``naked
aggression,'' signed orders freezing Iraqi assets and Kuwaiti
assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them. France quickly did the
same, while Britain froze Kuwaiti assets.
   Baker spoke to reporters aboard a U.S. Air Force jet en route
from the Siberian city of Irkutsk to Ulan Bator, the capital of
Mongolia, where he met with that country's leaders on an official
visit.
   The secretary said he asked Shevardnadze to halt ``any military
or arms deliveries that they might have in the pipeline to Iraq.''
   Baker said Shevardnadze ``was not pleased to hear that Iraqi
forces had moved into Kuwait.'' Baker said he had heard about the
invasion just before he went into a final negotiating session with
Shevardnadze this morning.
   Shevardnadze told reporters on his return to Moscow from Irkutsk
that every measure should be taken to end the Iraqi-Kuwait
conflict, Tass said. He said he would be consulting with his
advisers and the Soviet Union would take all necessary measures
that are possible.

   Killer bees, humbug! It's the ornery red,
imported fire ant that is threatening life and limb in the South
these days.
   And the situation keeps getting worse, says the Agriculture
Department. In 1957, fire ants occupied about 27 million acres. By
1985 their domain was 230 million acres, stretching from Texas to
Virginia and Puerto Rico.
   Regina Wiggen of the department's Agricultural Research Service
said people throughout the South ``have grudgingly surrendered
ground'' to fire ants since the pests were first seen in the United
States near Mobile, Ala., in 1918.
   Wiggen, associate editor of the agency's Agricultural Research
magazine, wrote that fire ants are a threat to humans and
livestock. They also destroy or disfigure the landscape with their
mounds.
   ``In the ants' wake, playground and picnic areas lie abandoned,
parks disfigured, golf courses churned up and cemeteries damaged,''
she said. ``No one who is hypersensitive to stinging insects should
risk being stung.''
   All of this is old stuff to millions of Southerners who have
learned to look carefully where they sit or lie in the great
outdoors. But the ants may be getting antsy about moving on.
   For years, Wiggen said, scientists believed the ants have a
limited tolerance of cold weather. In their native Argentina, they
don't range south of 38 degrees latitude, which is comparable to
the pests' northernmost range in the United States.
   But lately there has been concern that the imported red fire ant
has been mingling with black varieties, which might produce a
cold-tolerant fire ant.
   Isolated colonies have been spotted in Arizona and California.
The December 1989 issue of Nursery Digest warned that once
established in California, fire ants probably will spread to much
of the western seaboard.
   The USDA for many years worked with states to fight fire ants
with chemicals and poisoned bait. Wiggen said that between 1957 and
1977, millions of acres were treated with the insecticide Mirex,
but ``without enduring avail.''
   Now, she said, ``We know that widespread application of toxic
chemicals may put the environment at more risk than the ants.''
   The magazine's cover story by Jessica Morrison Silva tells about
the life cycle of fire ants, how they threaten homeowners, public
lands and farming areas. The colony is based on a queen, which has
a rather bizarre sex life.
   ``After a virgin queen mates in midair, she descends to the
ground,'' Silva said. ``No longer needing wings, she now chews or
breaks them off. The remaining wing muscles are used as a
nutritional source for her in establishing the new colony and in
egg production.''
   Parasites and other natural weapons are being examined as
possible methods of curbing the pests. Scientists are seeking a
complex of fire ant disease and natural pests that will do the job.
   Meanwhile, Africanized bees _ the so-called ``killer bees'' of
Hollywood fame _ are still moving north and may cross the
U.S.-Mexico border any time now, say USDA officials.
   While these aggressive bee can be threatening, they still only
sting from one end. The fire ant, according to USDA entomologists,
grabs you with its jaws and socks it to you with its tail stinger.
Both the bite and sting are painful.

   The Agriculture Department says China has
bought an additional 247,900 metric tons of U.S. wheat under a
price subsidy program.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday that two private
exporting companies made the deals under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for December, he said.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized China under EEP
on May 2. Previous allocations had been exhausted except for 5,050
tons. Dickerson said China has about 760,000 tons remaining in its
current allocation.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 9.1 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at around $2.62 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $24 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $20.40 per ton, or
about 56 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Continental Grain Co.,
207,900 tons; and Cargill Inc., 40,000 tons.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 2.2 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1990-91 wheat marketing year that
began June 1, compared with 5.6 million tons in 1989-90.

   Rural development councils will be started
this summer in eight states as a forerunner of a nationwide project
to boost development in rural America, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter announced.
   The councils will be started in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi,
Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Washington, he said
Wednesday.
   Existing resources will be used to form the councils, which will
have full-time coordinators, Yeutter said. A goal will be to form
state-level partnerships between federal and state governments and
the private sector.
   ``The participants will create a long-term strategy for applying
federal rural development resources and will carry out joint
actions to implement the strategy,'' Yeutter said.
   Councils will be made up of federal officials representing
various departments and agencies that have significant rural
development roles. Such agencies would include the Extension
Service and the Farmers Home Administration, for example.

   A philanthropist has given $1.4 million
to Connecticut College to create a professorship honoring Nobel
Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel.
   The endowment creating the Elie Wiesel Chair in Judaic Studies
is the largest gift in the private college's 79-year history,
school officials said Thursday.
   The money was donated by Jo Ann Hess Myers, a 1967 graduate of
the school, who runs a private day school in Birmingham, Ala. She
also directs the Fig Tree Foundation, a private philanthropy.
   Wiesel, a survivor of a Nazi death camp, has crusaded for human
rights throughout the world. He has written more than 30 books and
is the founder of the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. He won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.
   The college has formed a search committee to fill the post with
a Judaic scholar, who is to develop a program including philosophy,

   Japan, heavily dependent on Persian Gulf oil, said
Thursday it was greatly concerned by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
urged Iraq to withdraw its troops.
   Japan imports 99 percent of its oil and its economy has proved
vulnerable to ``oil shocks'' sparked by Middle East conflicts.
   Iraq's predawn invasion of Kuwait drove down the Japanese yen
and sent shares plunging on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Kuwait and
Iraq, between them, supply 11.2 percent of Japan's oil needs.
   Japan ``deeply regrets'' the invasion and ``is watching the
worsening situation with great concern,'' chief government
spokesman Misoji Sakamoto said.
   He said Japan ``requests the immediate retreat of the Iraqi
forces'' and expressed hope the issues between the two Persian Gulf
neighbors could be settled without more force.
   The Arab oil embargo after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war was a
powerful though short-term setback to Japan's economic growth. Oil
prices skyrocketed, causing inflation and cutbacks in industrial
production.
   In the first quarter of 1990, Iraq supplied Japan with about
260,000 barrels of oil a day, or 6.2 percent of its needs, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said. During the same
period, Kuwait was the source of 210,000 barrels a day, or 5.0
percent of Japan's needs, it said.
   Trading in crude oil was chaotic in Far Eastern markets
Thursday. Bid prices climbed sharply.
   As of the end of June, Japan had 142 days worth of oil in
reserve, an official at the trade ministry said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, predicted oil
prices would fluctuate in the short term but said it was too early
to say what long-term effect there might be on Japan's oil imports.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the widely quoted Nikkei index of
225 selected issues closed down 592.81 points at 30,245.18, a drop
of 1.92 percent for the day.
   The dollar closed up 2.25 yen at 148.90 yen in Tokyo after
trading in a wide range. Earlier this week the dollar had gone into
a decline based on interest-rate concerns, but it moved sharply up
on news of the Middle East fighting.
   Earlier this year, Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi visited
Tokyo seeking increased oil sales to Japan. He said Japanese
companies had expressed interest in helping to develop oil fields,
with expenses to be repaid in oil from the fields.

<HEAD>South Korea to Procede With Five-Day Border Opening</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea said Thursday it would
procede with a five-day border opening in mid-August and that all
citizens will be allowed to visit Communist North Korea if the
North guarantees their safe return.
   Unification Minister Hong Sung-chul announced details of the
Aug. 13-17 border opening and urged North Korea to support the
historic project, designed to promote unification of the divided
peninsula.
   North Korea said it would send a delegation across the border
during the five-day period to ``console'' several prominent South
Korean dissidents jailed for allegedly promoting national
unification.
   South Korean security laws ban private contacts between South
Korean citizens and North Korea, which Seoul considers an enemy
country.
   In a nationally televised news conference, Hong said any of
South Korea's 42 million citizens may apply to visit the North and
any applicants accepted and guaranteed by Pyongyang authorities
would be allowed to cross the border. This was the first time South
Korea has said it would allow all citizens, including dissidents,
to visit Communist North Korea.
   ``We hope ... this would not only lead to the reunion of
separated families, but also the sharing of the emotional
excitement by embracing each other after 45 years of separation,''
Hong told a news conference.
   The minister said, however, South Korean dissidents would not be
allowed to to attend a North Korean-sponsored unification rally at
the border village of Panmunjom Aug. 15 unless they are joined by
``representatives of all walks of life.''
   North Korea has said it will welcome only dissidents from the
South at the rally.
   In a report, monitored in Tokyo Thursday, North Korea said that
on Aug. 15 it would send a delegation to visit a jailed South
Korean radical student and other dissidents.
   ``Our consolatory team is going to meet and console not only Im
Su-gyong but also father Moon Gyu-hyon ... and at the same time,
Rev. Moon Ik-hwan and his family,'' according to the North's
official Korean Central News Agency.
   Ms. Im, a 22-year-old sophomore in Seoul, was sentenced to five
years in prison for making an illegal trip to North Korea last
year. She said she went to the North to promote unification.
   Moon Gyu-hyon, a 41-year-old Catholic priest, and Moon Ik-hwan,
a 72-year-old protestant minister, also received long prison terms
for violating national security laws. The two Moons are unrelated.
   There was no immediate South Korean response to the North Korean
move.
   The Seoul announcement Thursday was a followed a July 20
proclamation by President Roh Tae-woo calling for a five-day border
opening to allow free and unrestricted travel between the hostile
Koreas.
   North Korea effectively rejected Roh's proposal by listing a set
of preconditions unlikely to be met, including releasing political
prisoners and dismantling border walls that South Korea claims do
not exist.
   The Korean peninsula was divided into the Communist North and
capitalist South in 1945 and the two nations fought a war in the
early 1950s. Despite sporadic dialogue aimed at reducing tensions,
they remain archenemies.
   The border between the Koreas is the most heavily fortified in
the world, with more than 1.5 million armed troops behind concrete
bunkers and barbed wire on either side. There are no telephone,
radio, television or travel exchanges.

<HEAD>Soviets Say They Have 40,000 Tons of Chemical Weapons Stored</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The commander of Soviet chemical forces says the
Soviets have a stockpile of 40,000 tons of chemical weapons, about
10,000 tons less than previous independent estimates.
   Meanwhile, France on Thursday proposed a high-level meeting in
January to chart the path to speedy agreement to ban the use,
production and stockpiling of chemical weapons the world over.
   The Soviet official, Stanislav Petrov, told the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda that all Soviet chemical weapons are stored on
Soviet territory. There have long been rumors that the Soviets have
chemical-weapons depots in Eastern Europe.
   Petrov confirmed to Pravda there are no facilities in the Soviet
Union to destroy the chemical weapons, despite a superpower
agreement to eliminate 80 percent of them immediately.
   A weapons-destruction plant was built at Chapayevsk, 550 miles
southwest of Moscow, but was closed last summer after local
residents complained it would add to already high pollution levels.
   Petrov told Pravda the Chapayevsk site would become a training
center for workers who destroy chemical weapons.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature was asked to find a safe site to
build a replacement plant, but so far no lawmaker has volunteered a
district in which to place it.
   Petrov said he would like to build two destruction facilities in
sparsely populated areas.
   Independent sources had previously estimated the Soviet Union
had 40,000 tons of chemical weapons compared with 30,000 tons in
the United States.
   The French call for high-level talks on chemical weapons came at
the 40-nation Geneva Conference on Disarmament.
   France's chief delegate Pierre Morel said despite earlier
headway, talks on a chemical weapons treaty had bogged down. Morel
proposed that January's meeting be held at the ministerial level to
speed the treaty process.

   Here is a comparison of the military forces of Iraq and Kuwait:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>___</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The numbers of Iraqi servicemen and weapons dwarf those of
Kuwait.
   Iraq has been engaged in a major defense buildup since President
Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979. Its combined military forces
are estimated at 1 million, with roughly half as active reservists.
   The army encompasses five armored, two mechanized and 42
infantry divisions with 20 special forces brigades. Equipment
includes 3,500 Soviet tanks, 1,500 Chinese tanks, and 100 PT-76
light tanks according to figures from the 1989-90 Military Balance.
   The air force has about 500 combat aircraft. The planes are in
large part Soviet-designed, including 30 Su-7s, 50 Su-20s, and 30
Su-25s. There are 25 MiG-25s, 18 MiG-29s and 90 MiG-23s
interceptors and fighter-bombers. Additionally, there are 40
Chinese made J-6's, 80 J-7s, as well as 64 Mirage F-IEQ5s with
Exocet.
   Military service of up to two years is compulsory for all men at
18 years of age.
   On Tuesday, as Iraqi and Kuwaiti envoys met to discuss their
border and oil dispute, diplomats said Iraq had massed 100,000
troops on Kuwait's border. That was more than triple the number
estimated earlier.
   The reported Iraqi troop buildup included hundreds of tanks and
armored personnel carriers.

   Kuwait has a total of about 20,300 troops in its military.
   It maintains a small but well-equipped army with two armored
brigades, a mechanized infantry brigade, one artillery brigade and
a surface-to-surface missile battalion.
   Its air force, initially a small combat force, has grown to
include two squadrons with 20 Mirage F1-CK fighters, 4 F-1BKs and
24 A-4KU Skyhawk attack aircraft.
   For most Kuwaitis, military service is compulsory for 24 months.

   Iraq's powerful army invaded this small oil-rich
kingdom early today. Tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's
palace and government buildings, and the emir fled to Saudi Arabia,
Kuwaiti officials said.
   Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government
buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the country's
oil facilities. He appealed for U.S. military intervention.
   A Pentagon source said U.S. Navy ships were diverted to the
region, but President Bush said the subject of intervention was not
being discussed.
   ``The Iraqis have occupied all of Kuwait!'' a Kuwaiti government
official shouted in a telephone interview. Diplomatic sources in
the Persian Gulf estimated that more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed
or wounded.
   The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed it
invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a
coup and established ``The Provisional Government of Free Kuwait.''
Kuwait and U.N. diplomats labeled the coup report a farce.
   The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and
Iraq, caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a
disputed border area. Saddam also accused Kuwait of exceeding OPEC
production quotas, thus driving down the price of oil, a major
Iraqi revenue source.
   The attack had wide-ranging ramifications:
   _Oil prices soared $3 a barrel in early trading because of fears
the invasion would disrupt supplies. Prices were about $2 higher
later.
   _President Bush signed orders freezing Iraqi assets in the
United States and blocking most Iraqi imports, including oil. Oil
accounts for 97 percent of Iraqi imports to the United States and
makes up about 3.5 percent of U.S. oil consumption. Bush also froze
Kuwaiti assets to prevent Iraq from seizing them.
   _The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier, halted weapons
sales.
   _The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to denounce the invasion
and demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
   _A Pentagon source said the aircraft carrier USS Independence,
escorted by a six-ship battle group, was diverted from the Indian
Ocean toward the gulf, where other U.S. ships were already
patrolling.
   _Secretary of State James A. Baker III planned to fly to Moscow
to issue a rare joint statement Friday with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze about the invasion. The plan, which was
announced in Washington, illustrates the dramatic improvement in
relations between the superpowers, who once routinely lined up on
opposite sides of most regional disputes.
   Kuwait's U.S. ambassador, Sheik Saud Nasir al-Sabah, told
reporters in Washington: ``We are desperate for any help we can
get.'' He appealed specifically for American intervention.
   In recent days, diplomats said Iraq had massed more than 100,000
troops at the border. Kuwait's entire armed forces has 20,300
soldiers.
   Bush said the United States would ``take whatever steps
necessary'' to defend interests in the gulf. Asked if this included
military force, Bush said: ``We're not discussing intervention.''
But he said he would not discuss military options publicly.
   It was the first time in modern history an Arab nation had
invaded another and taken over its government.
   Kuwait's army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight
years of war with Iran. Iraq has emerged as the Arab world's
strongest and most militant military power, and Saddam has a vast
arsenal of chemical and conventional weapons.
   Diplomats said about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a
few hours after crossing the border 40 miles away at dawn.
Witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports by
artillery and the air force was vicious.
   The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwait's ruler, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah. Residents said the palace was seized after
about two hours of heavy artillery barrages.
   Diplomats said Sheik Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah, one of the emir's
brothers, was killed while trying to defend the palace.
   There were about 50 tanks around the palace and the neighboring
American Embassy, residents said.
   The al-Sabah family has ruled the city-state for almost 250
years. The Kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in Saudi
Arabia.
   Operating from an unknown location, al-Ahmed's government
responded to the formation of the provisional government by
stating: ``Kuwait is Kuwait to its people, let by the emir, Sheik
Jaber, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad. God preserve them from all
harm.''
   For its part, the provisional government announced through
Baghdad's official Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving
parliament and would hold ``free and honest elections'' at a future
date.
   The Iraqi forces were led by the elite Republican Guard, which
did the brunt of fighting in the Iran-Iraq war. Troops set up
roadblocks at major intersections and shot at cars that did not
stop.
   Baghdad television said Iraq qould withdraw its forces within
days or weeks, depending on how quickly the situation stabilized.
   Kuwait's land and sea borders were closed, as was the airport.
   Diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the
evacuation of nationals, and foreigners were asked to keep a low
profile.
   There are about 4,000 Americans among the large expatriate
community in Kuwait, where more than 60 percent of the 1.8 million
residents are foreigners. U.S. officials monitoring the situation
had no reports of harm to U.S. citizens in Iraq, White House
spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
   Foreigners reached by telephone said they watched from their
windows or dived for cover as the invasion began. ``We were totally
unprepared,'' said Catherine Baker of Illinois. ``One feels like
there should have been a bit of warning.''
   The British Embassy was hit by shell-fire and the Sheraton and
Hilton hotels evacuated their clientele, the diplomats said.
   The invasion came hours after Iraq broke off talks intended to
mend its differences with Kuwait.
   Iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally
Kuwait two weeks ago. Washington declared its support for Kuwait
from the start.
   During the Iran-Iraq war, American ships protected U.S.-flagged
Kuwaiti tankers from attacks in the gulf.

   Fishing was banned in seafood-rich
Galveston Bay because of a 500,000-gallon oil spill, and crews
trying to raise a submerged barge closed the Houston Ship Channel
again today.
   Cleanup crews, meanwhile, got the go-ahead from the federal
government to use oil-eating bacteria on the 17-mile slick, but
Gov. Bill Clements said after flying over the area today that he
does not think the microbes will be effective.
   ``It's as much a precautionary measure as anything else,'' Neil
Travis, chief of the Texas Health Department's consumer health
protection bureau, said Wednesday in announcing the open-ended ban
on commercial and private fishing.
   The move was a blow to the seafood industry, and some business
owners threatened to sue to recoup their losses. The bay is one of
the state's richest fishing grounds, generating revenue estimated
at more than $338 million a year.
   ``Everybody's wondering how in the hell they're going to pay
their mortgages on their boats and their businesses,'' said Walter
Jakubas, owner of Captain Wally's Marina in San Leon.
   The spill occurred Saturday when a Greek tanker collided with
two oil barges in the Houston Ship Channel. The tanker did not lose
any of its cargo of jet fuel. But one Apex Towing Co. barge sank
and the other was damaged.
   The Coast Guard said today it is taking charge of cleanup
operations.
   ``We took over the cleanup. We call the shots now and we pay the
bills,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Rick Meidt. But, he said, the
Coast Guard will bill the towing company for the cleanup costs.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Glenn Rosenholm said divers have found
a crack between two cargo tanks on the barge and numerous holes,
including one 7-foot gash in the stern.
   Some 10,000 gallons of oil was found still aboard the barge in
one of the tanks.
   Rosenholm said divers put a sling under the barge in front of
the crack to try to raise it enough to move it out of the ship
channel.
   Gov. Bill Clements met with Coast Guard Rear Adm. Jim Loy early
today before flying over the accident site. Clements, who has
declared a state emergency for the area, planned to visit Eagle
Point, a peninsula that was doused with oil and is being used as a
command post for cleanup crews.
   Rosenholm said the Coast Guard estimates about 50,000 gallons of
oil remained on the water throughout Galveston Bay today.
   ``That does not include oil contained in the booms, or picked up
by skimmers,'' he said. ``That's just what remains free-floating.''
   More than 50,000 gallons of oil had been skimmed from the bay by
Wednesday and other oil has been trapped in booms surrounding the
spill area and sweeps used to deflect oil from sensitive marshland
areas.
   Meanwhile, officials from the Coast Guard and the National
Transportation Safety Board resumed a hearing today into the cause
of the accident.
   On Wednesday, officials heard testimony from the captain and
helmsman aboard the Shinoussa, who blamed a Houston Ship Channel
pilot for directing them into the path of the barges. The pilot,
however, claimed the helmsman turned the wrong way.
   State officials had hoped to begin deploying some 800 pounds of
oil-eating microbes in some areas of the bay later today.
   But Clements, who declared the bay an emergency area Wednesday,
said he didn't think bioremediation would be effective on the
17-mile oil slick because it has broken up.
   ``It is so fragmented out there. There's no concentration of the
kind of slick that you would address it to,'' Clements said.
   Blanton Moore, a representative of the Texas General Land
Office, disagreed. He said the microbes could be used on the
remaining sheen.
   ``It has no negative effects and can only help the bay,'' he
said of the process.
   The naturally occurring microbes reduce the oil to a fatty
substance that sinks and is eaten by fish. When the oil is gone,
the microbes die.
   Earlier this summer, the oil-eaters underwent their first
open-sea test on a small section of the 3.9-million-gallon Mega
Borg oil spill. State officials said the microbes gobbled up the
oil and caused no harm to the environment.
   Travis of the state Health Department said the fishing ban was
imposed because shrimpers were spotted fishing in oil-tainted areas
and because oil was found on some shrimp caught in the bay.
   The ban prohibits the taking of any aquatic organisms, including
fish, crabs, oysters and shrimp.
   ``We're at a point of extreme frustration,'' said Clifford
Hillman, owner of Hillman Shrimp and Oyster Co. in San Leon. ``Are
the effects of this two weeks, two years or twenty years?''
   Larry McKinney, director of resource protection at the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department, said oil settling on the bottom
could kill small marine life _ a crucial link in the food chain _
and reduce the number of shrimp, oysters, crabs and other wildlife.
   ``If it's on the surface, at least you have the chance of
cleaning it up. If it gets to the bottom, there's nothing you can
do, you're stuck with it,'' McKinney said. ``That's when you get
the long-term impact. If it gets in the sediment, it can be very
toxic over a long period of time _ up to five years.''

   For 234 years, the al-Sabah family ruled Kuwait.
But on Thursday, the once-proud dynasty was shattered by a lighting
invasion by Iraq.
   At least one member of the royal family was reported to have
been killed, and the emir himself, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
and his crown prince, Sheik Saad Abdullah al-Sabah, fled to
neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   ``This is a black Thursday in the annals of not only the
al-Sabah dynasty but also Arab solidarity,'' one Kuwaiti government
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted witnesses as saying Sheik
Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the emir's brother, was gunned down as he
tried to defend the emir's palace. Persian Gulf diplomats, speaking
on condition of anonymity, later confirmed he was dead.
   Members of the al-Sabah family, like other royal families in the
rest of the Gulf region, fill many key posts in the government,
army, police and private sector. They number more than 1,000.
   Oil has given Kuwait one of the highest per capita incomes in
the world _ about $20,000. But this has not meant peace for the
tiny Persian Gulf country of 1.8 million people.
   The 64-year-old emir, Sheik Jaber, has come in for much of the
turbulence.
   When his country gained independence from Britain in 1961, he
was named minister of finance and economy _ just as Iraq was
claiming sovereignty. Britain had to bring in troops to get the
Iraqis to back off.
   By the time he moved up the ranks to prime minister, crown
prince and finally emir late 1977, Kuwait was a country in the
throes of a parliamentary crisis.
   By 1980, Parliament was restored and Kuwait was an Arab pioneer
of Western-style democracy.
   But soon the Iraq-Iran war broke out. Kuwait was a leading
supporter of Iraq, bearing $15 billion of Baghdad's war costs.
   From 1980 to 1988, Kuwait was caught in between the fighting of
two neighboring powers, Iraq and Iran, hearing the sound of gunfire
from the front only 90 miles away.
   Iran, dedicated to spreading its Islamic revolution and angry at
Kuwait for supporting Iraq, attacked Kuwaiti shipping lanes and oil
facilities. The United States later protected reflagged Kuwaiti
tankers in the gulf.
   Kuwaitis also believe Iran was behind a spate of terrorism that
began with the 1983 car bombings of U.S. and French embassies.
   Seventeen pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem terrorists were convicted
for those attacks, and demands for their release were hammered home
with more attacks.
   Bombs were planted in downtown locations, at oil installations
and at seafront cafes. In May 1985, there was a car-bomb attack on
Sheik Jaber's life, but he escaped with minor injuries.
   With the end of the war, the emir hoped Baghdad would settle its
longstanding border dispuate with Kuwait. But it never did.

   President Bush today condemned Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait as ``naked aggression,'' froze control of Iraqi assets in
the United States and blocked almost all imports from the oil-rich
Middle Eastern country.
   Bush demanded that Iraq withdraw its troops but said military
intervention was not under discussion. Nonetheless, the Pentagon
ordered the aircraft carrier USS Independence and a six-ship battle
group toward the strife-torn Persian Gulf.
   With Kuwait's royal family in exile, the kingdom's ambassador to
Washington pleaded for help.
   ``We don't have a chance if we don't get any aid from our
friends,'' Saud Nasir al-Sabah told reporters. ``U.S. intervention
at this stage is of paramount importance.''
   The chief U.S. military presence in the Gulf is the eight-ship
Joint Task Force Middle East, led by the command ship USS LaSalle.
Battle-ready Marines are stationed on the super-secret Diego Garcia
base in the Indian Ocean, but moving their equipment would require
at least 10 days, a military source said.
   The Bush administration rejected as ``a patent fraud'' the Iraqi
claim that the invasion came at the behest of an interim Kuwaiti
government. ``We just can't accept that kind of explanation,'' said
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
   After pleas from U.S. officials, the Soviet Union said it would
cut off arms shipments to Iraq. U.S. and Soviet officials scheduled
a joint declaration on the war for Friday in Moscow.
   Bush's condemnation of the invasion won general endorsement in
Congress. The House quickly passed a bill, 416-0, embodying and
toughening Bush's economic sanctions.
   The only criticism of the president came from lawmakers who said
he should have acted earlier.
   Bush said he had not been taken totally by surprise by the
invasion. ``We had good intelligence and our intelligence has had
me concerned for some time now,'' he said.
   Government officials who would not be identified by name said
the United States was told of the invasion at 8:30 p.m. Washington
time Wednesday, about 3{ hours after it began.
   Bush's early morning order cut off virtually all commerce
between the United States and Iraq. The only exceptions were
publications and shipments to Iraq of donated food, clothing and
medical supplies.
   Later in the day he issued a memorandum to agency heads barring
any financial assistance, loan guaratnees or export license to Iraq.
   Iraq and Kuwait together supply less than 10 percent of U.S. oil
imports, according to U.S. industry officials. However, the
instability is certain to affect domestic oil prices.
   Bush summoned reporters before an early morning meeting with his
top national security advisers and said he was viewing the Middle
East tumult ``with utmost gravity.''
   ``We remain committed to take whatever actions are necessary to
defend our longstanding, vital interests in the (Persian) Gulf,''
Bush said, adding that his advisers would ``consider all possible
options available to us.''
   Lt. Gen. Howard Graves of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff,
traveling in Mongolia with Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
said the United States was considering ``political, military or
economic'' moves against Iraq. Pentagon sources identified one
option as assisting evacuation of 3,000 Americans from Kuwait.
   Bush said he would cut short a trip to Aspen, Colo., for a visit
with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and return to
Washington Thursday night.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney decided not to go to Aspen to
remain in Washington, and Baker headed for Moscow for a joint
announcement with the Soviets.
   The State Department said at midday that all 270 U.S. Embassy
personnel in Kuwait were safe and that the embassy grounds had not
been penetrated during the fighting. The department acknowledged
that one option under consideration was withdrawal of the U.S.
ambassador from Iraq, but added that Ambassador April Glaspie had
left the country for vacation before the invasion _ an indication
the United States did not take seriously Iraq's threatening buildup
along the Kuwaiti border.
   In Congress, there was widespread condemnation of the invasion
and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said the House would vote to
impose sanctions against Iraq. The House Foreign Affairs Committee
met in special session to write Bush's executive order into law.
   Foley declined to criticize Bush for resisting earlier sanctions
against Iraq. But Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said if Bush had acted earlier,
after Iraq had used gas against some of its own citizens during the
war with Iran, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``may have gotten the
message that his lawlessness would not be tolerated.''
   Ambassador Saud Nasir al-Sabah of Kuwait told reporters here:
``We are desperate for any help we can get.''
   Experts said Bush harbored few easy military options to bolster
his condemnation of the Iraqi invasion.
   ``We're not discussing intervention,'' Bush said, but
acknowledged, ``I would not discuss it (publicly) if I were.''
   In announcing his economic sanctions against Iraq, Bush
expressed concern about how the invasion would affect U.S. oil
supplies. The United States imports about half its oil. The boycott
against Iraq is certain to affect domestic oil prices.
   According to a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, the United
States imports more than $3 billion in goods annually from Iraq; 97
percent of the total is oil.
   The executive order also froze Kuwait property under U.S.
jurisdiction _ a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it. Bush
urged other nations to take similar measures and called on Moscow
to suspend arms shipments to Baghdad.
   The State Department advised Americans to postpone travel to
Kuwait.
   Bush said his advisers would explore a range of options
including a request for unspecified action by the United Nations.
   ``The United States strongly condemns the Iraqi military
invasion of Kuwait and calls for the immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of all the Iraqi forces,'' Bush said. ``There is no
place for this sort of naked aggression in today's world.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. and chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, told NBC News that he doesn't believe the United States
has a military option at the moment, ``nor do we have a treaty
obligation.''
   ``I believe that our primary recourse should be very intensive
diplomatic activity,'' he said. ``We ought to put the burden on the
nations in that region to bring to bear all the diplomatic and
economic power.''
   William J. Crowe, retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
described the level of danger in the Middle East as ``very high.''
He told ABC the U.S. military could not play a significant role
unless invited by Saudi Arabia and given access to Saudi military
facilities.
   Even before the invasion, Congress had been pressuring Bush to
impose new sanctions on Iraq over its belligerent moves toward
Mideast neighbors.
   Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait
after claiming that Kuwait's production of oil beyond quotas of the
OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraq's
revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that
straddles the border.
   Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah,
Saudi Arabia, aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis and
complained that Kuwait was not negotiating seriously.

   John Goodman's mother woke him up Thursday to
tell him of his Emmy nomination, Angela Lansbury was whispered the
news by her husband and Dana Delany thought a bagel and coffee was
in order.
   The pre-dawn announcement in the West Coast caught some stars
asleep, others on the road or finishing movies. One actress was
speechless after what she perceived as a snub by the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   Miss Lansbury, who has never won an Emmy despite numerous
nominations for ``Murder, She Wrote,'' was with her hairdresser
when she learned of the nomination from her husband, Peter Shaw. He
leaned over and whispered the news.
   ``I'm surprised and delighted. It's wonderful to know you're
still up there and your performance is intact,'' Miss Lansbury said.
   Leading the Emmys list with 14 nominations was the nighttime
soap series ``Twin Peaks,'' which revolves around junk food and
murder in a Pacific Northwest lumber town. Co-executive producer
Mark Frost was elated.
   ``I guess I feel like the quality of life in Twin Peaks got a
little better today,'' Frost said. ``I guess our chances of
surviving are a little bit better.''
   ``Empty Nest'' star Richard Mulligan, a two-time Emmy winner,
was at home studying a script and eating strawberries when the
telephone rang with the news of his latest nomination. ``To be
recognized by your peers is great,'' he said.
   Roseanne Barr was missing from the nominations list for a second
year as she expected, but her show ``Roseanne'' got two
nominations. Earlier this week, she told interviewer Sally Jessy
Raphael she had felt ``snubbed.''
   ``It really hurt my feelings,'' she said, adding she felt the
``same thing'' would happen this year.
   She reacted Thursday through her publicist: ``Miss Barr is
resting her voice and is unavailable for comment,'' said Chris
Hamblin.
   ``I think Roseanne and her show are the best things on
television,'' said Miss Barr's husband-producer, Tom Arnold, from
the couple's Malibu home. ``It always takes the industry a few
years to catch up with anything ground-breaking.''
   ``Roseanne'' co-star John Goodman's mother was watching the
nominations announcement on TV in St. Louis when she heard her
son's name called. She phoned him in Los Angeles and woke him up.
   ``I'm extremely happy. I did not get into this business to win
awards but if somebody nominates me I'll take it,'' said Goodman,
who was completing his latest movie ``Barton Fink'' before
returning to the ``Roseanne'' set Monday.
   Estelle Getty and Betty White were nominated in different
categories for their roles on ``The Golden Girls,'' but co-stars
Rue McClanahan and Bea Arthur weren't on the list.
   ``It's always a thrill to be nominated and I'm very grateful to
the academy, but it amazes me how anyone can pick and choose
because it is so strongly an ensemble company,'' said Miss Getty.
   Melanie Mayron, nominated again for her role on
``thirtysomething,'' was asleep when the telephone rang with the
news from the show's producer. She won the Emmy for supporting
actress in a drama series in 1989.
   ``You never get tired of being nominated _ a virgin every
time,'' Miss Mayron said. ``I'm ecstatic. I felt like this last
season I did some of the best work of my career.''
   ``China Beach'' star Dana Delany, who won the dramatic series
Emmy last year, was nominated again for her role as nurse Colleen
McMurphy.
   Miss Delany was participating in the news conference announcing
nominations with actor Lou Gossett. When Gossett began reading the
lead actress in a drama series category, Miss Delany thought she
wasn't nominated because they had been going in alphabetical order.
   ``I was thinking, `Well, that's not it this year. It's not in
the cards,''' Miss Delany said. Then, Gossett read her name. ``I
think they did that just to get me,'' she said.
   ``It's almost scarier this year because I know I have a
chance,'' she said. ``I think I'll go out and celebrate maybe with
a bagel and a cup of coffee.''

   The mood at the embassies of two warring
Middle East nations was a study in contrasts Thursday, as Kuwait's
ambassador pleaded for outside assistance and the Iraqi envoy
defiantly defended his country's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We don't stand a chance if we don't get any aid from our
friends,'' a somber Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti ambassador,
told reporters in an ornate chamber of his embassy.
   Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait's ruling family, asked the United
States to intervene militarily to help his oil-rich emirate repulse
Iraqi troops who invaded on Wednesday.
   As Al-Sabah spoke of deaths in Kuwait and the country's efforts
to resist, a member of the staff wiped tears from his eyes and
muffled a sob.
   ``We are desperate for any help we can get,'' he said,
describing his plea as a ``universal cry for help.''
   Al-Sabah said Kuwait's leader is directing the resistance from
Saudi Arabia, but that his country is ``under occupation'' by Iraqi
forces.
   Hours later, Iraqi ambassador Mohamed Sadiq Al-Mashat summoned
reporters to his embassy, where he said any foreign interference
``will only aggravate the situation.''
   Surrounded by aides, Al-Mashat stood in front of a life-size
picture of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The ambassador
disregarded two power failures that occurred during his remarks.
   Contradicting Kuwaiti claims to the contrary, the Iraqi envoy
insisted that the ``interim free government'' installed after the
invasion ``has asked the Iraqi government to extend assistance for
the maintenance of law and order.''
   Al-Mashat said Iraqi forces ``will be withdrawn as soon as the
situation is settled down and as soon as the free government of
Kuwait has so wished.''
   He refused to answer questions, choosing instead to read a
five-paragraph statement.
   Both ambassadors said they had been in contact with Bush
administration officials but neither shed any light on the U.S.
response.
   Bush condemned the invasion but said he was not considering
military intervention.
   Defense Department sources said the aircraft carrier
Independence was en route toward the Persian Gulf from the Indian
Ocean to bolster U.S. forces in the Middle East, but would not
actually enter gulf waters.

   A frail, repentant Roswell Gilbert
regained his freedom Thursday after spending more than 5 years in
prison for the 1985 ``mercy killing'' of his ailing wife.
   The 81-year-old Gilbert acknowledged publicly for the first time
that he was wrong to kill his wife of 51 years, who suffered from
Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis.
   ``I shouldn't have killed my wife, now I know that,'' said
Gilbert, whose case focused national attention on the killing of an
ailing loved one.
   ``It's difficult to explain to anyone who hasn't been through
this trauma, a mental trauma really,'' said Gilbert.
   He said his wife's illness ``created just a complete state of
desperation in my mind ... it's a lousy excuse, but that's what it
was.''
   Gilbert shot his wife, Emily, twice with a 9mm Luger in March
1985 in their Fort Lauderdale apartment. He was serving a mandatory
minimum prison term of 25 years on a murder conviction when he was
granted clemency on humanitarian grounds Wednesday by Gov. Bob
Martinez and the Florida Cabinet.
   Gilbert, who suffers from heart and lung disease, wants to
regain some of the 40 pounds he lost in prison and ``recoup my
health.''
   He chuckled at reports that his death may be imminent.
   ``I'm a tough old rooster ... don't believe it,'' said Gilbert,
who said he would probably ignore his daughter's pleas to stop
smoking.
   ``Daddy has very bad emphysema and one of the main things I'm
going to do is really insist he quit smoking,'' said daughter
Martha ``Skipper'' Moran, the Gilberts' only child.
   The retired engineer was examined in January and a medical
report showed he suffered from heart and lung disease and was
considered ``at high risk of death at any time,'' because of his
age and physical condition.
   Gilbert, who left the North Florida Reception Center with a
handful of possessions in a small brown paper bag, described prison
as a ``human zoo.''
   ``It's been plain awful for a freedom-loving person like
myself,'' he said.
   Besides a hamburger, a shot of bourbon and a nice soft bed,
Gilbert said he was looking forward to seeing his three grown
grandchildren soon.
   ``I haven't had a good look at them for a long time,'' he said.
   He left the prison for a friend's home in an undisclosed
location. His daughter said she expected him to resettle in Fort
Lauderdale.
   The lawyer who prosecuted Gilbert at the murder trial, Kelly
Hancock, said he was relieved that the state decided to free
Gilbert.
   ``His health is deteriorated, and I think his release puts to an
end a very, very tragic case _ a case that made us all more aware
of the problems of the sick and the elderly have,'' said Hancock,
who's now in private practice and publicly sought Gilbert's release
in recent weeks.
   Actor Robert Young, who portrayed Gilbert in a 1987 television
movie, ``Mercy or Murder?,'' also said he was elated with the news
of Gilbert's clemency.
   ``That's sensational,'' said the 83-year-old Young, best known
for his roles in the TV series ``Father Knows Best,'' and ``Marcus
Welby, M.D.''
   Although the two men never met, Young said he spoke with Gilbert
many times by telephone.
   ``We had wonderful chats,'' said Young. ``There was no self-pity
in him at all. It was a remarkable experience for me to play the
role and get to know the man.''
   Mrs. Moran, who lives in Baltimore, said she believes her mother
would say: ``It's about time they let him out.''

<HEAD>Senators Want to Allow Abortions at Military Hospitals</HEAD>

   Two Democratic senators opened a new skirmish
in the war over abortion Thursday, saying they want to reverse a
regulation that bans abortions in military hospitals.
   Sens. Tim Wirth of Colorado and John Glenn of Ohio planned to
try to add the amendment to reverse the 2-year-old rule to the
Defense Department authorization bill for fiscal 1991. The bill is
being debated in the Senate.
   They said the rule, banning abortions except when the life of
the mother is endangered, has caused tragic hardship for some U.S.
service personnel and their families.
   ``Why should a whole group of Americans, who happen to be in
service, be treated like second-class citizens?'' Wirth asked.
   The amendment, he said, was triggered by the story of Charles
and Kaoru Zwierzynski, who appeared with the senators at a news
conference.
   The couple went to a Japanese hospital last year when a Navy
hospital said it couldn't perform an abortion _ despite a diagnosis
that the fetus was severely deformed.
   ``We really went through hell,'' Mrs. Zwierzynski said. ``It was
the worst thing that has happened in my life.''
   Zwierzynski is a petty officer on the USS Midway, which was in
Japan. Mrs. Zwierzynski's fetus had major organs forming outside
its body and a malformed heart.
   Physicians, including one at the U.S. military hospital, said
the fetus had no chance of survival and recommended an abortion.
   Because the military hospital was banned from abortions, the
couple went to a Japanese doctor and used their savings to pay
$2,400 for an abortion. It was Mrs. Zwierzynski's first pregnancy.
   The amendment would require that U.S. military personnel and
their dependents who are stationed outside the United States be
able to obtain any reproductive health service in military
hospitals. Abortions, for which federal funds are not permitted to
be used, would have to be paid for by the individual.
   The prohibition was imposed in 1988 by the Reagan administration
and was left in force by the Bush administration. The amendment is
being sought by abortion-rights groups, including Planned
Parenthood Federation.
   Doug Johnson, legislative director for the National Right to
Life Committee, said opponents would try to block the amendment and
were focusing their efforts on trying to deny supporters the 60
votes they need to cut off opponents' debate.
   ``We think every baby, even those with severe handicaps, ought
to be allowed their allotted lifespan,'' Johnson said.
   Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., an abortion-rights leader in the House,
said he would try to offer a similar amendment when the defense
bill comes to the House floor in September.
   He said his amendment would provide a new test for the strength
of abortion-rights forces, which last year won passage of
exemptions in the ban on federally funded abortions to cover cases
of rape and incest, but were unable to override President Bush's
veto of the measure.

   More than six out of 10 black infants in the
United States are born to unmarried mothers, indicating a risk for
health problems, federal health officials said Thursday.
   Among all races, 24 percent of infants were born to unmarried
women in 1987, the latest year for which statistics are available.
That's up sixfold from 1950, the national Centers for Disease
Control said in reporting the findings.
   The disproportionate percentage of black infants born to
unmarried mothers _ 62 percent, compared to 17 percent of white
infants _ represents an escalating trend. In 1983, 59 percent of
black births were to single mothers, compared to 13 percent of
white births, the CDC said.
   ``These figures are alarming,'' said Evelyn Lowery, president of
SCLC Women, a family-issues arm of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. ``The problems are not getting better;
they're getting worse.''
   The Atlanta-based CDC, in its weekly report, said single
motherhood is a signal of possible health problems for the child,
not a direct cause.
   ``Marital status confers neither risk nor protection to the
infant,'' the CDC said. ``Rather, the principal benefits of
marriage to infant survival are economic and social support.''
   U.S. infant mortality rates are higher for infants born to
unmarried mothers than for children of marriage, for both whites
and blacks, the CDC said, citing new analysis of 1983 statistics.
For whites, the infant mortality rate was 13.1 per 1,000 children
of unmarried mothers, compared to 7.8 for children of married
mothers. For blacks, the non-marriage infant mortality rate was
19.6, compared to 14.6 for children of married women.
   ``Our effort at teen pregnancy education has got to continue,''
said Mrs. Lowery, the wife of SCLC President Joseph Lowery. ``Many
of these young people are (themselves) from single parent homes.''
   Young black women have been especially affected by cutbacks in
educational aid and in work programs, and ``this impacts _ as well
as the economy _ the teen-age pregnancy problem,'' she said.
``They're out there on the loose.''
   The ``benefits of marriage'' may not be there for babies born to
teen-agers, even if the mothers are married, the CDC said.
Mortality rates for infants of married mothers under 18 tend to be
even worse than for unmarried mothers under 18, probably because of
a ``severe lack of economic and social support'' in struggling teen
marriages, the CDC said.
   ``Married teen-agers are ... more likely to establish
independent households, thereby estranging themselves from
financial and child-care support from relatives,'' the agency said.
   But in general, unmarried mothers often are poor, and ``adverse
pregnancy outcomes are correlated with poverty conditions,'' the
CDC said.
   The Census Bureau has reported that 36 percent of black families
with a child under 18 are classified as living in poverty, compared
to 12 percent of similar white families.

   President Bush on Thursday called for
Iraq to withdraw its invading armies from Kuwait, and said he would
not rule out direct U.S. military intervention in the conflict.
   Bush denounced Iraq's move as ``naked aggression,'' and said he
wants to see ``the restoration of the Kuwaiti leaders to their
rightful place.''
   The president spoke at a news conference with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher near Aspen, Colo., several hours after
he signed an order freezing control of Iraqi assets in the United
States and blocking almost all imports from the oil-rich Middle
Eastern country.
   Thatcher called on Iraq to heed the United Nations Security
Council's call for a withdrawal. ``We need a collective and
effective will of the nations belonging to the U.N.'' to resolve
the conflict, she said.
   Speaking of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Thatcher said, ``We
find his behavior intolerable.''
   Bush said he had talked by telephone during the day with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and other Arab leaders, and said
he was encouraged by their efforts to find an ``Arab answer'' to
the problem.
   He also noted approvingly that the Soviets had cut off military
supplies to Iraq, and that Secretary of State James A. Baker III
would stop in Moscow on his way back to the United States from Asia.
   ``He would not be stopping in Moscow unless there would be a
good degree of cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United
States,'' he said.
   Asked about a plea from Kuwait's ambassador for military
assistance, the president said it would be inappropriate to discuss
options.
   He added, ``We're not ruling any options in but we're not ruling
any options out.''
   Bush's reply was a slight departure from his answer to a similar
question a few hours earlier in Washington. Then, he said he was
``not discussing'' military steps.
   In Washington, American officials said it would be difficult for
the United States to mount an effective military response anytime
soon.
   Bush was asked about reports that Americans working in Kuwait
were being rounded up by Iraqi forces.
   ``I don't have anything on that right now. Secondly, it would
affect us in a very dramatic way because I view a fundamental
responsibility of my presidency is protecting American citizens. If
they're put into harm's way I have certain responsibilities,'' Bush
said.
   Ms. Thatcher denounced the invasion, and said it would be
``totally unacceptable if it were allowed to endure. There would be
many other small countries that would never feel safe.''
   The two leaders met near Aspen, Colorado. The meeting had been
scheduled to discuss the changing face of Europe and western
security needs in the post-Cold War ear, but it undoubtedly turned
as well to Iraq's overnight invasion of its Middle Eastern neighbor.
   The president was flying back to Washington later in the day,
rather than spend the night in Colorado as originally planned.

Statement</HEAD>

   The Kremlin suspended arms sales to Iraq Thursday
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he would join
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Moscow to condemn Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   A joint statement from the United States and the Soviet Union
demanding Iraq's immediate withdrawal from Kuwait _ combined with
their sanctions _ would mark highly unusual superpower cooperation
toward stopping a war.
   The Soviet Union is Iraq's major supplier of weapons.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass announced the Soviet
decision to suspend arms sales to Iraq, whose million-man army
overran Kuwait, which has a force estimated at 20,000.
   Almost all of Iraq's 5,500 tanks, most of its 500 warplanes,
most missiles, and much of its artillery are Soviet, said Hans
Binnerndijk of the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies. Iraq also has about 100 French Mirage jets,
Binnendijk said.
   Soviet television showed Soviet warplanes _ apparently MiG-29s,
MiG-25s and Sukhoi fighters _ flying over the desert city of
Kuwait. It showed Soviet-built tanks driving across sand and Iraqi
soldiers holding Soviet-designed Kalashnikov automatic rifles.
   The film clip also showed blurred shots of damaged buildings.
The announcer did not say, however, if the film was shot Thursday.
   On Friday, Baker is expected to arrive in Moscow, where he will
sign the joint statement with Shevardnadze, according to State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   Baker on Thursday arrived in the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator,
the last stop on a four-nation Asian tour. He traveled there from
the Siberian city of Irkutsk, where Shevardnadze and Baker were
meeting when they learned of the Iraqi attack.
   As he flew from Irkutsk to Mongolia Thursday afternoon, Baker
told reporters he had asked Shevardnadze to halt ``any military or
arms deliveries that they might have in the pipeline to Iraq.''
   In Washington, President Bush immediately froze control of Iraqi
assets in the United States and blocked almost all imports from the
oil-rich Middle Eastern country.
   Baker had said Shevardnadze ``was not pleased to hear that Iraqi
forces had moved into Kuwait.''
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry in Moscow condemned the Iraqi attack
and urged an immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   Upon his return to Moscow, Shevardnadze told reporters every
measure should be taken to extinguish the conflict, according to
Tass. He said the Soviet Union would take all possible measures.
   Less than five hours later, Tass announced the suspension of
arms sales.
   Shevardnadze contacted Baker through the Soviet ambassador in
the Mongolian capital. Baker spoke by telephone with President
Bush, and the two decided Baker would fly to Moscow, Mrs. Tutwiler
said.
   The Soviet Union temporarily suspended its sales of arms to Iraq
after the Iran-Iraq war broke out in 1980 and took a neutral
position in the war. But Western intelligence sources said the
Soviets later resumed the arms shipments. The Iraqis strapped
boosters onto the short-range SCUD-B missiles bought from the
Soviets, so they could use them to bomb Tehran, the Iranian capital.
   Iraq makes its own Soviet T-72 tanks under license. Last year,
it was reported negotiatin aid in establishing its own facility for
building warplanes, including the Soviet MiG-29.
   The Soviet Union sold Iraq $23.47 billion in weapons between
1982 and 1989, according to a publication of the U.S. Congressional
Research Service.
   That is about 55 percent of the total arms purchased by Iraq in
that period, said the book, called ``Trends in Conventional Arms
Transfers to the Third World by Major Supplier, 1982-89.''
   Iraq imported nearly $2 billion in arms last year and the
Soviets were their major supplier, the book said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker
III on Thursday toasted the recent democratic reforms in this
long-time Soviet client state in the first visit of a top American
official since 1944.
   But Baker announced he would cut short his visit by two days and
on Friday fly to Moscow, where he and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze will issue a joint statement condemning Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Baker had planned to take a private hunting and fishing trip in
the Gobi Desert.
   ``Although it really breaks my heart to say this I think I
should return home but maybe this will give me an excuse to return
(to Mongolia),'' he said at a Mongolian government banquet.
   Baker said he made his decision after conferring with President
Bush. The banquet began an hour late, apparently because of the
lengthy phone call.
   During a short speech at the banquet, Baker praised Mongolia's
recent democratic reforms, which include free-market reforms and
multiparty elections.
   ``Your government and your people are moving forward together
toward a common goal of greater democracy, greater protection of
human rights and economic reform,'' he said. ``You have joined many
countries around the world on the road to reform.''
   After arriving Thursday, Baker signed an agreement to send Peace
Corps volunteers to teach English, along with accords on trade and
consular services.
   He also attended a festival of Mongolian culture, and watched
Mongolian wrestling, horse races and an archery competition. He
shot three arrows himself; two came close to the target and one
fell far short.
   ``I couldn't even pull it back,'' he joked, pointing to the bow.
   Baker, on a four-nation Asian tour, arrived from Irkutsk in the
Soviet Union, where he and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze discussed a third U.S.-Soviet summit, arms control and
the civil war in Afghanistan.
   At a joint news conference, Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union
would cease production of its rail-based mobile intercontinental
ballistic missile, the SS-24. The United States does not deploy
such missiles and their presence in the Soviet arsenal has been an
impediment to U.S.-Soviet strategic arms talks.
   In Ulan Bator, Baker held successive meetings with President
Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat, Prime Minister Sharavyn Gunjaadorg and
Communist Party Chairman Gombojavyn Ochirbat. The two Ochirbats are
unrelated.
   ``We are very heartened by the peaceful emergence of democracy
in Mongolia,'' he said before talks with the president. ``We have
expressed our desire to continue to support political and economic
reforms in Mongolia.''
   Mongolia held its first multiparty elections ever on Sunday. The
Communists agreed to give the opposition a role in the Cabinet
after it won a significant presence in the legislature.
   Baker also planned to meet with opposition leaders.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon and Mongolia's
deputy foreign minister, Olzvoi, initialed a trade agreement with
an ``understanding in principle'' to exchange most-favored nation
trade status, a State Department news release said. The agreement
will not be signed until after further talks. The Mongolians are
eager to obtain the trade status. They also want U.S. investment
and loans to help develop their stagnant economy as they embark on
a program of free-market reforms.
   Baker is the first high-level administration figure to visit
Mongolia since 1944, when Vice President Henry Wallace came on his
way from China to Irkutsk. At the time, the United States and
Soviet Union were World War II allies.
   The onset of the Cold War, however, halted most U.S.-Mongolian
contacts. Diplomatic relations were established only in 1987.
   ``For too long, Americans and Mongolians have been strangers,''
Baker said at the banquet. ``Now, we have the opportunity to become
friends.''
   The Mongolian-Soviet alliance began in 1921, when the Soviet Red
Army helped a small band of Mongolian revolutionaries oust their
Chinese overlords. Since then, Moscow has stationed troops in
Mongolia and been its chief source of economic aid.
   Moscow plans to withdraw all its troops by 1992 and is reducing
aid and investment. Mongolian officials say they want better
relations with the United States and other Western countries.

   All 30 people were killed when a small Soviet
airliner crashed while bound for the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh, searchers told the Soviet news agency Tass on
Thursday.
   The wreckage of the Aeroflot Yakovlev-40 was found Thursday
morning in the Lachin district of Azerbaijan, Tass said. The
aircraft had been flying from the Armenian capital of Yerevan to
Stepanakert.
   The city of Stepanakert is capital of the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   No official cause has been given for the crash. But the plane
disappeared while flying in heavy fog over the mountainous region.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is a mostly Armenian enclave inside the
republic of Azerbaijan. It has been the focus of a bitter ethnic
dispute that has left hundreds dead over the past two years.
   Poor weather and rough terrain hampered the search for the
aircraft, which had been carrying 26 passengers and four crew
members, Tass said.

   Rebels turned their backs on President
Samuel Doe's troops on Thursday and prepared to fight each other, a
source close to guerrilla leader Prince Johnson said.
   Diplomats said the rivalry between Johnson and his foe, Charles
Taylor, could prolong this West African nation's 7-month-old civil
war for weeks.
   Johnson's fighters withdrew Thursday from key positions they
have occupied in central Monrovia.
   That leaves the capital open to renewed occupation by Doe's
soldiers, who massacred up to 600 men, women and children Sunday in
an attack on St. Peter's Lutheran Church. Those killed were among
thousands of civilians who have sought sanctuary at churches and
embassies from tribal reprisals by troops and rebels.
   Hundreds of civilians again started fleeing from the city
Wednesday.
   Only a few fighters of Johnson's Independent Patriotic Front
were visible in areas of downtown Monrovia, which they captured
from Doe's troops earlier in the week.
   Gunfire broke out in parts of the city that were firmly under
Johnson's control on Wednesday.
   A big fire occurred in eastern Monrovia, but it was unclear
whether the blaze was touched off by the fighting. The fire raged
out of control because there is no longer a fire brigade in the
capital.
   Monrovia's 500,000 residents have been without running water,
electricity and food supplies for nearly a month.
   An American who has lived in Liberia for years and claims to be
close to Johnson said the rebel leader was turning his forces
around to confront Taylor's troops, who were advancing from behind
him.
   Like the other sources, the American spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Johnson broke with Taylor and his National Patriotic Front in
February and accuses his rival of being a Libyan stooge and a
communist. Johnson has said he does not share Taylor's aspirations
to lead Liberia.
   Taylor appears to have the larger of the two rebel forces, but
Johnson struck into the capital earlier in the bid to unseat Doe,
who is holed up in his heavily fortified executive mansion.
   ``No faction has established clear superiority, and it's not at
all clear that there will be an early end to the conflict,'' one
diplomat said.
   In the fighting since rebels invaded from neighboring Ivory
Coast last December, about 5,000 people have been killed, most of
them civilians.
   The insurgents accuse Doe of corruption and human rights abuses.
He has ruled this west African nation of more than 2 million people
since taking power in a 1980 coup.
   Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that he would be prepared to
discuss with Taylor a joint attack on Doe if both rebel forces were
in a position to advance on the presidential mansion. But Taylor's
troops remained blocked by government troops six miles from the
city center.
   Johnson also said he would welcome a U.N. peacekeeping force in
Liberia.
   ``We are not going to fight a neutral force,'' he said. ``We
would lay down our arms and let the neutral people carry on their
peacekeeping operation.''
   He held his news conference at his headquarters on suburban
Bushrod Island. The reporters' car came under fire on its way back
from there, first from the rebels, then from government troops.
   Troops loyal to Doe kept control of the Defense Ministry in
street-fighting Wednesday and of areas east of it leading to the
executive mansion and Barclay Training Center. The Finance
Ministry, the national bank and the telecommunications center on
Wednesday were under control of rebels led by Johnson.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Thursday
that the Justice Department will pursue all allegations of savings
and loan fraud, but he declined to comment on a report that the FBI
is seeking evidence of political influence-peddling in 1988 S&amp;L
bailout deals.
   The Los Angeles Times reported Thursday that the FBI was
investigating allegations of political favoritism in selecting
buyers for dozens of failed S&amp;Ls in deals which involved billions
of dollars in federal subsidies.
   While refusing to comment directly on that report, Thornburgh
told the Senate Banking Committee, ``Any allegations of wrongdoing
that relate to past or present conduct will be vigorously pursued.''
   The newspaper, quoting ``knowledgeable sources,'' said that for
at least a month the FBI has been conducting a major investigation
in connection with the 1988 deals made by the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board, which was dismantled by last year's S&amp;L legislation.
   That legislation also required the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., to review the deals to see whether the government could save
money by exercising contract options.
   L. William Seidman, FDIC chairman, told reporters after
appearing before the Senate panel: `We look in every instance for
any kind of illegal activity.''
   The FDIC's report is due at the end of this month. The agency is
estimating the transactions, including deals covering 87 failed
Texas thrifts, will cost the government $52 billion over the next
decade.
   Asked if the FDIC was cooperating with the FBI on the matter,
Seidman said, ``I assume we are. I have not looked into it. ... I'm
sure we are working with them on every case in which there is
alleged illegality.''
   The Times quoted an unidentified federal regulator who said an
FBI agent had offered him immunity from prosecution in exchange for
testimony on the deals. The regulator told the newspaper that some
of the transactions went through after upper-level federal
officials overruled lower-level officials who opposed the deals.
   Marvin Collins, U.S. attorney in Dallas, said in a telephone
interview that he could not comment on specific investigations, but
he said, ``We in the U.S. attorney's office in Dallas and in the
Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force will follow evidence of criminal
wrongdoing wherever it may lead.''
   M. Danny Wall, who served as chairman of the bank board, said in
a telephone interview that he had ``no indication whatsoever'' that
the FBI was investigating the 1988 deals and said they were not
politically influenced.
   ``I'm confident ... the senior people involved made the best
decisions based on the information available,'' he said.
   The newspaper's sources would not identify which deals were
under investigation by a special fraud task force headquartered in
Dallas, but said not all of the deals were suspect.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, has been conducting an inquiry
into one of the deals, the consolidation of 15 failed Texas thrifts
into Bluebonnet Savings Bank in Dallas.
   Metzenbaum is asking whether GOP lobbyist Robert Thompson, an
aide to President Bush when he was vice president, improperly
exerted his influence in helping Arizona insurance executive James
Fail acquire Bluebonnet.
   Separately, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday
unanimously adopted a motion to begin the process of enforcing its
subpoena against Thompson, who failed to appear for a July 31
subcommittee session. The motion directs Thompson to appear at an
Aug. 6 session or risk being held in contempt of Congress.

   U.S. Rep. Floyd Flake was indicted Thursday on
conspiracy and fraud charges alleging he embezzled thousands of
dollars from his church and a related senior citizens' housing
project.
   The indictment lists 17 counts against Flake, a 45-year-old
ordained minister, and nine against his wife, Margarett, 42, for
activities between 1983 and 1989.
   It alleged that Flake, a Democrat who represents New York's 6th
Congressional District, illegally diverted a total of $141,700 from
church and housing funds to his own use and failed to report it as
taxable income.
   Flake denied the charges and a lawyer for Mrs. Flake said they
added credence ``to the idea that even-handed treatment is not
being accorded to minority politicians.''
   Flake is pastor of the 156-year-old Allen African Methodist
Church in Queens, which built the 300-unit Allen Senior Citizens
Apartments in 1981 with a $10 million federal loan.
   The church operates the complex with a $100,000 monthly subsidy
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
indictment charged that between 1983 and 1987, the Flakes embezzled
$75,000 from the complex.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said the money was siphoned off in
$6,000 increments from quarterly HUD allocations of $9,000 set
aside for transporting senior citizen residents of the center on
local business. He said the actual transportation costs were only
$3,000 a quarter.
   The indictment alleged that Flake took an additional $66,700
from a special church ``ministerial expense fund'' account for his
own use between 1983 and 1988, again not reporting the money as
taxable income.
   Maloney said the church's 6,000 parishoners apparently were
unaware of the alleged theft because the special account was
managed by the Flakes themselves.
   Flake's attorney, Gustave Newman, said the money was used for
church purposes and the charges would not stand up in court.
   Newman also said the case would not affect Flake's plans to seek
re-election to a third term in the House this year.
   Ted Wells, Mrs. Flake's lawyer, described his client as ``really
only a secretary'' who signed tax forms and checks but had ``no
substantive involvement'' in the operations.
   The charges included one count of conspiracy, two of fraud and
six of tax evasion against each of the two defendants. In addition,
Flake is charged with four counts of filing false tax returns and
four of making false financial statements.
   If convicted on all 17 counts, Flake could be sentenced to a
maximum of 87 years in prison and fined up to $3.95 million. His
wife could face penalties of 55 years in prison and fines of up to
$2.1 million.
   Wells accused Maloney of furthering what he said was a pattern
of unfair prosecutions against minority politicians.
   ``This indictment is unfair treatment of a minority female and
by treating her this way, you just add fuel to the fire that
prosecutors are not handling these cases in an even-handed
fashion,'' he said.

<HEAD>Doctors Pioneer Embryo Screening for Test-Tube Births</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women with family histories of serious genetic
disorders now can have their embryos screened in the test-tube
before they are implanted into the womb, a doctor said Thursday who
pioneered the technique.
   Dr. Alan Handyside said the technique has been used only to
determine gender but researchers at the Royal Postgraduate Medical
School at Hammersmith Hospital hope the process can be refined to
detect other genetic information.
   Handyside said the technique has produced its first children.
   He said he and his colleagues are screening women with a family
history of so-called X-linked defects that strike only boys. In
these cases, only female embryos are implanted into the mother.
   The new procedure builds on techniques developed for in-vitro
fertilization and prenatal testing, Handyside said from the west
London hospital.
   Like in-vitro fertilization, eggs removed from the mother are
fertilized in a test tube where the embryos are allowed to grow for
three days, Handyside said.
   ``You cannot implant an embryo beyond the third day so we begin
work early in the third day when the embryo has multiplied to eight
cells,'' Handyside said.
   He said there is a 12-hour window for completing the screening.
   A single cell removed from the microscopic eight-cell embryo is
amplified and analyzed to determine whether it is male or female.
   The first children born after the screening process were twins,
Natalie and Danielle Edwards. The girls, born two weeks ago, were
five weeks premature but are healthy and growing, Handyside said.
   The mother, Debbie Edwards, approached the Hammersmith Hospital
team after learning she carried the gene for adrenoleukodystrophy,
a fatal disease similar to muscular dystrophy, Handyside said.
   Debbie's sister also carries the gene and has an 11-year-old boy
who was stricken at eight and is now totally disabled.
   Six other couples have gone through the program and are
expecting girls, Handyside said. The mothers carry the gene for any
of 200 diseases, including hemophilia, Duchenne muscular dystrophy
and adrenoleukodystrophy. All affect male children, Handyside said.
   Traditional prenatal screening takes cells from the placenta in
the first 8-10 weeks of pregnancy, and if genetic defects are
detected a women can opt for an abortion.
   Screening before an embryo is implanted reduces the risk of a
woman becoming infertile after repeated abortions, Handyside said.
   In addition, for families that risk passing on serious genetic
disease to males, the embryo procedure should be less emotionally
trying than an abortion, said Dr. Kathleen Nolan, a pediatrician
and ethicist at the Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y
   Since no one had removed a single cell from a 3-day-old embryo
before, Handyside said there were initial concerns.
   ``We had no direct evidence, but every animal and mammal we
looked at was able to regulate for removal of cells at early
stages,'' the embryologist said.
   Handyside said the embryo has a natural defense mechanism that
allows growth to continue normally.
   ``It appears to be a response to damage which could happen in
the reproductive tract,'' he said.

   Here is the text of remarks by President
Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as they met with
reporters on Thursday. The first set of remarks came during a photo
opportunity; the second set was from a news conference held later.
   Q: Have you ruled out military intervention in the Gulf, Mr.
President?
   BUSH: No, Terry, listen. Here's the ground rules. We're going to
have a press scrum-availability afterward with the Prime Minister
and be glad to respond to questions. This is what they call a photo
opportunity, and no questions will be entertained.
   Q: But there's a deadline every minute, sir.
   Q: For the sake of those British television stations who are
running out of time, Mr. President, could we just have one word?
   BUSH: Not now, but we'll be glad to stay by the ground rules
here.
   MRS. THATCHER: It won't be long.
   BUSH: It wouldn't be fair to those who aren't here yet for the
press availability.
   Q: Have you frozen Iraqi assets, Mrs. Thatcher?
   BUSH: He's having trouble hearing.
   Q: Were you able to make contact, sir, with any Middle Eastern
leaders as you indicated you wanted to? Can you tell us if you
spoke to _
   BUSH: I'm not going to take any questions. It's not _ it really
isn't fair, Charles, to those who have been told that the press
conference will be in an hour and some minutes. o, really, we have
to abide by that. But it's been very interesting, very active.
   STAFF: Thank you all.
   Q: We haven't had a chance, Mr. President, to hear what Mrs.
Thatcher has said at all.
   BUSH: Well _
   MRS. THATCHER: Don't worry. You'll hear later.
   Q: It will be too late for us, I fear. (Referring again to
British television deadline.)
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BUSH: Well, let me first welcome Prime Minister Thatcher back to
the United States. It's a very timely visit. And, as you can well
imagine,
   (Audio break.)
   Not surprisingly, I find myself very much in accord with the
views of the Prime Minister. I reported to her on contacts that
I've had since I left Washington, personal contacts with King
Hussein, Mr. Mubarak of Egypt _ President Mubarak, President Salih
of Yemen _ a long conversation just now. I can tell you that Jim
Baker has been in close touch with the Soviet leadership and
indeed, the last plan was for him to stop in Moscow on his way back
here.
   We are concerned about the situation, but I find that Prime
Minister Thatcher and I are looking at it on exactly the same
wavelength _ concerned about this naked aggression, condemning it
and hoping that a peaceful solution will be found that will result
in the restoration of the Kuwaiti leaders to their rightful place
and prior to that, a withdrawal of Iraqi forces.
   Prime Minister, welcome to Colorado and to the United States.
And, if you care to say a word on that, then we can take the
questions.
   MRS. THATCHER: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for the
welcome.
   We have, of course, been discussing the main question, as the
President indicated. Iraq has violated and taken over the territory
of a country which is a full member of the United Nations. That is
totally unacceptable and if it were allowed to endure, then there
would be many other small countries that could never feel safe. The
Security Council acted swiftly last night under United States
leadership, well supported by the votes of 14 members of the
Security Council, and rightly demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi
troops. If that withdrawal is not swiftly forthcoming, we have to
consider the next step. The next step would be further
consideration by the Security Council of possible measures under
Chapter 7.
   The fundamental question is this: whether the nations of the
world have the collective will effectively to see that Security
Council resolution is upheld; whether they have the collective will
effectively to do anything which the Security Council further
agrees to see that Iraq withdraws and that the government of Kuwait
is restored to Kuwait. None of us can do it separately. We need a
collective and effective will of the nations belonging to the
United Nations. First the Security Council, and then the support of
all the others to make it effective.
   Q: Mr. President, when Kuwaiti shipping was in danger in the
Gulf War, you put those ships under American flag. Now Kuwait
itself has been invaded. The Kuwaiti ambassador says that they're
desperate for help and that American intervention is of paramount
importance. Will you answer that call, and how will you?
   BUSH: I answer that we're considering what the next steps by the
United States should be, just as we strongly support what Prime
Minister Thatcher said about collective action in the United
Nations.
   Q: Are you still not contemplating military intervention?
   BUSH: No. I mentioned at the time we were going to discuss
different options, which I did after that first press conference
this morning, and we're not ruling any options in but we're not
ruling any options out. And so that is about where we are right
now. We had thorough briefings _ you know who was at the meeting
today _ by General Powell, General Schwarzkopf and others. But I
think it would be inappropriate to discuss options.

<HEAD>ASPEN: contacted Israel?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   BUSH: There was _ we've had contact with Israel, yes. I have not
personally, but we have. And they asked for restraint; they asked
for a short period of time in which to have this Arab solution
evolve and be placed into effect. And they are concerned,
obviously, with this naked aggression.
   But it was more along that line, ``let us try now as neighbors
and Arabs to resolve this.'' And I made clear to them that it had
gone beyond simply a regional dispute because of the naked
aggression that violates the United Nations Charter.
   Q: And what did Israel say it would do at this point?
   BUSH: I would have to think back to the details of it, but
offering cooperation, I think, was about where we _ I would leave
it there.
   Q: Mr. President, we're hearing reports now that some of the
Americans, particularly in the oil fields, may have been rounded up
by Iraqi troops. Do you have anything to that? How does that affect
your reaction?
   BUSH: Well, I don't have anything on that right now. And
secondly, it would affect the United States in a very dramatic way
because I view a fundamental responsibility of my presidency as
protecting American citizens. And if they're threatened or harmed
or put into harms way, I have certain responsibilities. But, I
hadn't heard that, Charles. And I hope that that is not correct.
   Q: May I also ask about British citizens, any word, are they
safe?
   MRS. THATCHER: We have some British citizens in Kuwait. And you
probably know that there was a British Airways flight there on its
way to Africa and the passengers there are now in a hotel in Kuwait.
   So, we have some there and, of course, we have both _ we have
some _ a number of other British citizens in Kuwait, and we, too,
are concerned for their safety.
   Q: Mr. President, some of the smaller nations in the Persian
Gulf, Bahrain, the Emirates, and the others, obviously have a
reason to worry about what has happened here. What can the United
States and Great Britain say to those countries and those people
who are feeling very concerned today?
   BUSH: Well, the United States can say that ``we are very much
concerned for your safety.'' And this naked aggression would
understandably shake them to the core. And so, what we are trying
to do is to have collective action that will reverse this action
out and to make very clear that we are totally in accord with their
desire to see the Iraqis withdraw _ cease-fire, withdraw, and
restitution of the Kuwaiti government _ and that would be the most
reassuring thing of all for these countries who, whether it's true
or not, feel threatened by this action.
   Q: At the risk of being a hypothetical, if Iraq does not move
out quickly and has gained a foothold among the smaller Gulf
nations, what can the United States and other nations do militarily?
   BUSH: We have many options, and it is too hypothetical indeed
for me to comment on them. And I'd refer that to _ also to the
Prime Minister.
   MRS. THATCHER: Well, that's precisely why you're looking at the
next stage in the Security Council and what other measures can be
put into action mandatorily and why _ the very nations to whom you
refer _ we should also need their cooperation in putting other
actions into effect.
   Q: Mr. President, have you dispatched the USS Independence to
the region, and have you heard from Saudi Arabia?
   BUSH: Well, I would not discuss the movement of any US forces.
And what was the second part of your question?
   Q: Have you heard from Saudi Arabia? King Fahd.
   BUSH: No, but I have a call to King Fahd and I was supposed to
have taken that call before now, but it's been delayed by a few
minutes. And so, I hope before I leave here I will talk to him. I
think it is very important that I do talk to him. And I'd leave it
there I think.
   Q: (Off mike) _ him to say?
   BUSH: Huh?
   Q: What do you expect him to say?
   BUSH: Well, that's too hypothetical, too. But I _
   Q: Prime Minister?
   BUSH: I know he'll be expressing the same kind of concern that
we feel.
   Q: Prime Minister, if I could, the President, in his executive
order this morning, established a US embargo on trade with Iraq.
When you mentioned Chapter 7 measures, would you support in the
Security Council a call for an international embargo on Iraqi oil?
   MRS. THATCHER: We are prepared to support in the Security
Council those measures which collectively we can agree to and which
collectively we can make effective. Those are the two tests. We
have already frozen all Kuwaiti assets. The Kuwaitis have very
considerable assets, and it's important that those do not fall into
Iraq hands. Iraq, we believe, has only very, very small assets and
rather a lot of debt, so the position is rather different with her.
Right.
   BUSH: Thank you all very much.
   Q: Do you believe an oil embargo could be made effective?
   (No response to above question.)

<HEAD>DOT Judge Recommends Japanese Air Routes For Six U.S. Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge recommended
Thursday that five U.S. airlines be awarded direct routes to Japan
from six U.S. cities.
   The judge picked United, Delta, American, Continental and
America West airlines to fly the new routes in what is already a $6
billion annual aviation market for the two countries. Cities
getting new flights would be Chicago; Los Angeles and San Jose,
Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Seattle, and Honolulu.
   The complex, 90-page recommendation followed applications by a
dozen carriers to serve various U.S.-Japan routes under a new
international air agreement. A final decision on the carriers and
routes is expected in November by Transportation Department
officials.
   Judge John J. Mathias selected United Air Lines for
Chicago-Tokyo, describing United as ``the number one carrier in the
Pacific'' and the carrier that ``can be expected to enhance the
overall structure and level of competition in these international
markets.''
   Mathias proposed that two routes be awarded to Delta Air Lines:
Los Angeles-Tokyo and Portland, Ore.-Nagoya.
   Other carriers and routes he recommended were American Airlines
for San Jose-Tokyo, Continental Airlines for Seattle-Nagoya, and
America West Airlines for Honolulu-Nagoya.
   If approved, it would be the first Japanese route for America
West.
   Mathias said his recommendations followed department guidelines
for awarding the routes and would enhance competition among both
airlines and cities to be served.
   ``It is essential that the department see to it that U.S. flag
competition is maintained and enhanced by these awards,'' he said.
   All of the awards would give the airlines authority to fly
passengers, property and mail for five years.
   Mathias made the decision after hearing arguments from several
air carriers and officials of competing cities and airport
authorities.
   The airlines that sought routes but got none were Hawaiian,
Northwest, Pan American, and Trans World.
   Mathias also rejected applications that would have added direct
flights between Japan and St. Louis, Houston, and the Hawaiian
island of Maui.
   The new service could add more than 40 round-trip flights a week
between the two countries, with no carrier allowed to fly more than
seven flights a week on any route. U.S. carriers now operate 156
weekly flights to and from Japan.
   Three Japanese carriers are to get a dozen more weekly round
trips between Tokyo and Washington, Chicago, Newark and Honolulu,
along with 21 other flights connecting U.S. cities to Japanese
cities other than Tokyo or Osaka.
   Those routes were part of the international air agreement
between the United States and Japan, and the specific carriers will
be decided by Japanese authorities.
   Mathias said 19 carriers now serve U.S.-Japan routes, including
five U.S. flag carriers and 14 foreign airlines flying 269 weekly
nonstop routes to 12 U.S. cities.

<HEAD>Wheat Farmers Will Have To Idle More Acreage in 1991 To Get
Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat farmers will have to idle more of their
base acreage next year to qualify for federal price supports and
subsidies on their crop, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
announced Thursday.
   Tentatively, he said, the 1991 acreage reduction program for
wheat, or ARP, probably will be in the range of 10 percent to 20
percent. Farmers were required to set aside only 5 percent of their
acreage base this year.
   Yeutter said he could not make a final determination until
Congress completes work on the 1990 farm bill and it is accepted by
the administration. Both the House and Senate have passed versions
of the bill.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., and others had pressured Yeutter to make
a preliminary announcement of the 1991 wheat program in time for
winter wheat planting this fall.
   In a letter to Dole, Yeutter emphasized the announcement was
tentative and that it could change because of final provisions
approved in the 1990 farm bill.
   Yeutter also pledged that the Agriculture Department would
continue to use export subsidies under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, ``to keep wheat competitive in world markets.''
   Under EEP, exporters are given surplus government-owned
commodities as subsidies, or bonuses, so they can reduce prices
paid by selected foreign buyers. Wheat has been the biggest
beneficiary of the EEP subsidies.
   The program was started in 1985 to help meet export competition
by foreign shippers, notably the European Economic Community.
   Yeutter said EEP currently is available to 41 countries. He said
these initiatives ``can be utilized at any time to compete
head-to-head'' with the Europeans.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration kept close track of
Iraq's intentions in recent days through intelligence and
diplomatic contacts, but the timing of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
appears to have caught many officials by surprise.
   President Bush said Thursday he had not been taken totally by
off guard Wednesday night when Iraqi tanks rolled across the border
to Kuwait. ``We had good intelligence and our intelligence has had
me concerned for some time now,'' he said.
   In an unusual step, the CIA too denied being caught unawares.
   ``We provided policymakers with very useful and timely
information on these events. There were no surprises,'' CIA
spokesman Mark Mansfield said in a statement.
   An administration official, speaking on condition he not be
identified, said, ``This whole thing didn't come totally as a
surprise. The exact moment that they moved did, but it was
certainly obvious what they were preparing to do.''
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, confirmed that U.S. intelligence on Iraq's troop buildup
in recent weeks along the Kuwaiti border has been good.
   But speaking to reporters after closed-door briefings from
Pentagon officials, Boren also said many in the administration and
Congress had ``engaged in wishful thinking'' when they believed
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's only aim was to force Kuwait
to lower its oil production and thereby move oil prices upward.
   U.S. perceptions of Iraq's benign intent were further bolstered
by assurances from Arab allies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, said
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Iraq, too, apparently assured the United States of its peaceful
intentions when Saddam met last week in Baghdad with U.S.
ambassador April Glaspie.
   U.S. officials passed on the Iraqi assurances to Kuwait, said
Kuwaiti Ambassador Saud Nasir al-Sabah.
   Glaspie, apparently convinced that all was well, then left Iraq
on a long-planned vacation, said the official.
   Despite warnings from the CIA that Iraq would invade, U.S.
officials appeared to have realized Iraq's actual intention only
shortly before the actual invasion began in the pre-dawn hours.
   Word of the invasion reached Washington at 8:30 p.m., sending
officials scurrying from their homes back to their offices at the
State Department and National Security Council.

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Group Sees `Dogmatic Approach' by Souter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abortion rights group said Thursday that
the judicial approach of Supreme Court nominee David Souter in a
New Hampshire case may signal his opposition to abortion rights.
   Souter, nominated by President Bush last week to succeed
retiring Justice William Brennan, has not ruled directly on the
abortion issue. His views on that and other controversial Supreme
Court issues are sure to come up in Senate confirmation hearings
beginning Sept. 13.
   The National Abortion Rights Action League said Thursday a
dissent by Souter while he was on the New Hampshire Supreme Court
reveals a ``dogmatic approach'' in his philosophy that the Senate
Judiciary Committee should question.
   Thomas Jipping, legal analyst for the conservative Coalitions
for America, said NARAL was ``grasping at straws'' and the case
simply shows Souter to be a careful jurist.
   In 1986, the majority of the state's high court ruled in a case
called In re Estate of Dionne that it was against the state's
constitution for judges to charge fees for special court sessions.
   Souter was the lone dissenter. The 1784 state constitution's
guarantee of the right ``to obtain justice freely, without being
obliged to purchase it,'' had to be seen in the context of its
time, referring to bribery and other special favors, and did not
apply to modern-day fees, Souter wrote.
   NARAL's attorneys, in a memo distributed to reporters, said
Thursday that Souter's ``dogmatic approach to original intent in
Dionne is cause for alarm.''
   If applied on the Supreme Court, such logic would go against not
only the court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade abortion rights decision but
also its landmark school desegregation decision of 1954, NARAL said.
   Patrick McGuigan, spokesman for Coalitions for America, said it
was wrong to compare the a judge's application of state law to the
Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution.
   Abortion rights advocates were less concerned with judicial
philosophy than with their cause, he said. ``Will this guy vote for
our agenda? That's what they're asking,'' he said.

   An emergency Arab League Council failed to
publicly condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday and
adjourned its meeting for 24 hours as Arab leaders held urgent
consultations on how to handle the crisis.
   Kuwait's Cabinet affairs minister, Abdel-Rahman el-Awadi told
reporters he asked the 21-nation Arab League to condemn the attack.
He accused Iraq of using the ``laws of the jungle.''
   President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein met in
Alexandria and telephoned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President
Bush, Saudi King Fahd and Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh on
the crisis. Hussein later left for home.
   Sources close to the Arab League Council said its members agreed
to convene an emergency Arab summit but decided to leave the when
and where up to Arab leaders. The sources spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in Cairo
at Kuwaiti request hours after Iraqi military forces took over the
small Persian Gulf state. Some member nations sent lower-level
representatives.
   Following its evening session, attended by Saadoon Hamadi, a
member of the Iraqi Revolutionary Council, Foreign Minister Esmat
Abdel-Meguid of Egypt told reporters the Council would meet again
Friday.
   Saddam promised Mubarak two weeks ago that he would not invade
Kuwait in their oil dispute.
   At Thursday's closed session, Hamadi reiterated Iraq's claim its
forces entered Kuwait at the request of a Kuwaiti revolutionary
group that had overthrown the government.
   A conference source said several Arab foreign ministers replied
that ``they considered this to be an Iraqi invasion which is
against all United Nations and Arab League conventions.''
   So far, only Lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister,
Salim Hoss, has joined Kuwait in Cairo in publicly condemning the
invasion _ the first time in modern history one Arab country
invaded another to take control of the government.
   Hoss told reporters, ``We do not see any justification for what
happened, whatever the arguments and pretexts.''
   The invasion was denounced by the United States and other
Western nations and by the Soviet Union.
   The Arab League Council met early Thursday and then adjourned to
await the arrival of Hamdoon. Iraq's ambassador to Egypt, Nabil
Najm, sat in until Hamdoon arrived.
   ``The United Nation's Security Council has condemned the
invasion and the issue is now being discussed within the framework
of the Arab League and we hope that it will issue a condemnation
within the hour and that Arabs stand against this invasion,''
Kuwait's Awadi said.
   ``Arab leaders must take the initiative and stop this bloodshed
and return things to their normal situation. We also call on Iraq
to withdraw its troops.''
   Hamadi told reporters upon arrival, ``I see this meeting as
unnecessary ... There is no government presently in Kuwait. There

   His comments were carried by the Middle East News Agency.
   MENA said Kuwait invoked the 1950 Arab joint defense pact and
asked the Arab League Council to dispatch a joint Arab force to
``defend Kuwait against the invasion.''
   In the event of military aggression against any League member,
the pact all members, to ``take, individually and collectively, all
steps available, including the use of armed force, to repel the
aggression and restore security and peace.''
   The ministers were in Cairo to attend the Organization of
Islamic Conference's foreign ministers meeting. All Arab League
members also belong to the Islamic conference.

<HEAD>With AM-Barry Trial, Bjt</HEAD>

   As a government prosecutor reeled off Marion
Barry's alleged sins to the jury for the last time, the mayor
stared sadly into space.
   ``He smoked and snorted his way through 1987 and 1988.... He
smoked and snorted his way right into 1989,'' said the prosecutor,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts. ``It's almost as if Mr.
Barry wanted to get caught.''
   His blunt assessment came in the final moments of Barry's
six-week drug and perjury trial. But if the government had the last
words, Barry's defense lawyer had some of the most colorful.
   The government's witnesses were ``little Lucifers and small
Satans,'' all of them survivors looking out for No. 1, attorney R.
Kenneth Mundy said in his closing arguments.
   One of them came ``out of a crevice,'' he said. Another was
``down, destitute and desperate.'' A third, who had fled Iran,
believed he would be killed if he returned. ``He was going to avoid
going back to Iran no matter what the cost,'' Mundy said.
   Mundy reserved his most caustic descriptions for convicted drug
dealer Charles Lewis, a linchpin in the government's case. An
artful dodger, Mundy said. The eternal salesperson selling himself
to the jury. A loose cannon. The memory of an elephant _ after more
than 100 hours of preparatory meetings with prosecutors.
   The Barry trial attracted all manner of spectators, from
anonymous law students to the city's famous and flamboyant. It also
inflamed racial tensions and sensitivities, even to the point where
Barry's press secretary accused courtroom artists of making
Roberts, a light-skinned black, look too dark.
   Barry and his wife, Effi, chatted and laughed Thursday during a
brief break. But Mrs. Barry, sitting next to Barry's mother, sat
through most of the closing arguments looking grim.
   On Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin had twice
belittled Barry by comparing him to a child. She had apologized to
the jury for the sexual nature of some of the testimony, saying it
was impossible to separate the sex and drugs in Barry's life.
   Then came Mundy, who amidst his skewering of the government's
witnesses and tactics painted an unflattering picture of his own
client as a philanderer and occasional drug user.
   Mundy tried to justify some of Barry's behavior, such as his
repeated public denials of drug use and strong support for
anti-drug campaigns. He wanted to keep others from falling through
the ice along with him, Mundy said.
   ``What else was he to do as mayor?'' Mundy asked. ``Was he to go
out and say it's OK to use drugs? I use drugs?'' He was trying,
``in his own frailty,'' to say it's wrong, the defense lawyer said.
   But the prosecution team had other explanations _ among them
hypocrisy, paranoia, compulsion and a habit of blaming others for
what was his fault.
   ``Marion Barry was out to get himself,'' said Roberts. ``He must
rise up to his responsibility and accept responsibility for his
conduct.''
   Barry strode out of the courthouse at the end of the day wearing
a purple boutonniere, telling reporters that ``purple is for the
power of God.... He gives us the strength to overcome the
maliciousness of the U.S. government. We're up against Goliath.''
   Barry said he had been free of chemical dependencies for 194
days.
   ``I've admitted my own problems,'' he said. ``There's no shame
in having a problem. The shame is in not getting help.'' Later, he
added, ``No one can suffer any more pain or shame or hurt than me.''

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday it
has suspended all programs involving business with Iraq, including
credit arrangements and export subsidy benefits.
   Officials said the action followed through on President Bush's
order earlier in the day which imposed a virtual trade embargo in
retaliation for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq has been a large buyer of U.S. farm commodities, including
wheat, barley, cattle, poultry and eggs at subsidized prices.
Credit programs also have been used by Iraq to buy U.S. products,
which also have included rice and sugar.
   In all, farm exports to Iraq have been running at about $700
million a year, according to USDA records.
   R.E. Anderson Jr., administrator of the department's Foreign
Agricultural Service, said the suspension of programs used by Iraq
will be in effect ``until further notice.''
   Additionally, he said, the department will not approve
applications and issue credit guarantees for any sale of
agricultural commodities for Iraq which were not exported prior to
Aug. 2.

   The House Banking Committee wants New York
real estate developer Donald Trump to explain how he managed to
persuade major banks to loan him $2 billion that he is now
struggling to repay.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the panel, has
twice invited Trump to an Aug. 9 committee session. So far, Trump
hasn't replied.
   At a time when soured real estate loans are cutting into many
banks' profits, the committee wants to look into ``commercial real
estate lending principles ... in general and more specifically the
banks' handling of the Trump organization loans,'' Gonzalez said in
a letter to Trump.
   Gonzalez, in a notice to committee members Thursday, said the
Trump loans illustrate the problems banks are having in some areas
of the country.
   Representatives of state and federal regulatory agencies have
said they will appear, as have three banking analysts.
   However, representatives of Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and other
banks who lent to Trump haven't replied to the panel's invitations.

   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered from Texas to the south
Atlantic Coast on Thursday, but most of the nation basked under
sunny and partly sunny skies.
   Record heat continued across Florida, shattering records and
straining electrical utilities' ability to serve residents who
cranked up air conditioners.
   Daytona Beach sweltered in 97-degree heat, beating its

   Iraq says it invaded Kuwait at the
request of a revolutionary organization there, but diplomats
dismiss that rationale as a large-scale charade.
   The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the
flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional
Free Kuwait Government.
   Britain's U.N. ambassador, Crispin Tickell, called the Iraqi
action ``an invasion from the outside ... a phony coup d'etat from
within.'' He said the invasion had led to ``the purported
establishment of a puppet government.''
   In a rare display of solidarity, the United States and the
Soviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions. The
U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
   But Iraq's deputy permanent U.N. representative, Sabah Talat
Kadrat, said the Security Council should not be debating the issue,
because the fall of the Kuwaiti Emir, Sheik Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah, was an internal matter.
   The official Kuwait News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, did not
issue a single story all day. Its computer periodically sputtered
out the phrase ``Line cut.''
   On the other hand, state-run Iraqi News Agency from Baghdad came
alive with a series of communiques from the ``provisional
government.'' The members were not identified.
   The first statement said the provisional government ``finds that
one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the
deposed, corrupt government to our brothers in Iraq.''
   Iraq has been feuding with Kuwait over a border dispute. It has
also accused Kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, costing Iraq of
much-needed revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are
higher.
   The statement on the Iraqi News Agency said the border dispute
would be settled with ``fraternity and Arab national interests,''
indicating Iraq would probably take the land it wants.
   The statement also said the Al-Sabah family, which had ruled
Kuwait for almost 250 years, was working in concert with Zionist
and colonial powers to plot against Iraq.
   That is the charge the Iraqi press leveled at Kuwait when
tensions began to rise in mid-July.
   ``Falsification of elections, authoritarianism, persecution of
patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the
Al-Sabah family,'' the statement said.
   Kuwait is one of the few Arab states that has experimented with
a freely elected parliament. A new National Council with 50 members
voted into office and 25 appointed by the emir took office after
June elections.
   The communiques from the Iraqi News Agency said the National
Council has been disbanded.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Allow Stricter Abortion Clinic Regulations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge rejected a state
attempt to implement tougher rules at Florida's abortion clinics,
saying current regulations sufficiently protect women's health.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez of Fort
Lauderdale on Wednesday marks another setback on the abortion issue
for Gov. Bob Martinez.
   The Republican governor failed in October to persuade
legislators to pass bills limiting access to abortions in the
nation's first test of last summer's U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services. Last fall, the state
Supreme Court also threw out a parental-consent law supported by
the governor.
   ``What I think this means is that nothing will be changed,
ever,'' said Charlene Carres, a lawyer with the Florida chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union who argued against any new rules.
   State attorneys contended that the Webster ruling, which stemmed
from a Missouri case and granted states broader powers to regulate
abortion, gave Florida's Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services more authority over the clinics.
   Assistant Attorney General Jim Peters argued at a hearing last
month that an abortion clinic crackdown was warranted because of
``intolerable conditions'' found at south Florida clinics last fall
after The Miami Herald published a report detailing bloodstained
wrappings and leaking oxygen tanks at a clinic.
   But Gonzalez rejected that argument in his four-page order.
   ``Contrary to popular opinion, Webster does not constitute a
significant modification in decisional law, nor would it justify or
permit any change in the prior judgment of this court,'' the judge
wrote.
   Robyn Blumner, executive director of the Florida ACLU, said the
organization was pleased with the decision.
   ``What the judge said was that Roe vs. Wade is not dead,'' she
said.
   Gonzalez ruled in 1982 that, under the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision guaranteeing a right to abortion, the Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services could only check licenses, records and
disposal of fetal remains and make certain that only physicians are
performing abortions.
   The agency could not inspect staff, equipment or medical care
standards. It wanted 22 tougher rules, including being able to
conduct unscheduled inspections, expand licensing procedures and
set a number of standards for sanitation, medical care and
infection control.
   ``It would certainly be disappointing that the judge wouldn't
let the state do more to protect the health and safety of women,''
said Martinez's press secretary, Jon Peck. ``It's certainly in the
public's interest to make sure there is quality medical care at all
of these facilities.''

   The country's new non-Communist president
pledged to work for more democracy, but protesters in the capital
Thursday kept up their pressure on the governing Socialist Party.
   The Socialists were also reportedly plagued by defections. In
some cases, entire local leaderships quit the party.
   Zhelyu Zhelev was elected Wednesday as the country's first
non-Communist president in more than four decades. His supporters
picked him as a compromise candidate in an effort to overcome
growing political polarization as Bulgaria introduces greater
democracy.
   ``It will be my basic endeavor ... to strengthen parliamentary
democracy; to adopt, in the shortest possible time, a democratic
constitution; and to implement the most important political and
economic reforms,'' Zhelev said in an interview published in the
daily Demokratsiya. The newspaper is put out by Zhelev's opposition
party, the Union of Democratic Forces.
   Asked about the most urgent tasks in coming weeks, Zhelev said,
``First there must be active consultations between the key
political forces toward creation of a strong, competent
government.''
   The makeup of the new government was still not clear, but
Zhelev's words suggested it may have the backing of the opposition.
   A statement Wednesday by the Socialist Party called on all
members to support ``the inevitable and necessary political
compromises that are being reached by the party.''
   However, anti-government protesters vowed at a jubilant rally of
15,000 Thursday night to continue their push for more democracy,
despite the new president.
   The protesters, who have been camped outside Socialist party
headquarters for almost a month, said the Socialists could pass key
measures with their parliamentary majority. They demanded
investigation of the party's property and an independent review of
the June elections won by the Socialists.
   ``The supreme aim of our movement is to unite all the layers of
society that want to struggle against the totalitarian system,
against the gloomy presence that has blocked the ways of real
democracy,'' protest leader Kolya Fevov told the rally.
   Bulgaria began its march toward democracy with popular
demonstrations last year. In November, party members ousted
longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov. They later changed their
name to the Socialist Party.
   The election of the new president Wednesday appeared to have
caused serious discord in their ranks.
   Entire local party organizations and individuals sent telegrams
to the Socialist leadership in Sofia announcing they quit the
party, sources close to the party said. The extent of defections
was not clear in the absence of official word.
   More than half the 211 Socialist deputies voted against Zhelev.
But the new president won 284 of the 389 votes cast.

   The Soviet government suspended its abrupt
crackdown on visa-free travel along its western border Thursday
after it stranded huge crowds of travelers.
   The Soviet television news announced the halt in visa-free
travel for Soviet citizens was being postponed. It will now take
effect Aug. 10.
   Officials said they were cracking down because store shelves
near the borders were being stripped by travelers seeking bargains.
   Under the visa-free rule, Soviets long barred from foreign
travel have been pouring back and forth across the borders to
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary carrying only their internal
passports with an extra page freely available from local police
stations. Obtaining an external passport is still a lengthy task.
   Trade by individuals has exploded as Soviets and their neighbors
discovered each of their countries has different shortages of
consumer goods, and varying subsidized prices.
   Poles are eager to buy Soviet pots and pans, vodka, caviar,
champagne, radios, TVs, gold jewelry and watches because they are
far cheaper. Mushrooms, for example, cost 10 times as much in
Poland as in the Soviet Union.
   On the Polish side, travelers buy jeans, cosmetics and Taiwanese
and Turkish clothes, and sell them in the Soviet Union at inflated
black market prices.
   The Polish PAP news agency said Soviets were waiting as much as
20 hours to pass through the border.
   At Ogrodniki, the crossing from northwest Poland into Lithuania,
the wait was four hours on the Polish side and 15 hours on the
Soviet side. A Polish newspaper reported that Soviet customs
officials were slow and arrogant, opening car trunks and
disappearing for hours.

   The Iraqi conquest of Kuwait has catapulted
Iraq to the top ranks of world oil powers and poses new economic
risks for the United States and other countries dependent on
imported oil, private analysts said Thursday.
   It was unclear whether the Iraqi invasion of its tiny neighbor
at the northern tip of the Persian Gulf would slow or halt Kuwait's
oil production, but the conflict seemed to signal an important
shift in the balance of world oil power.
   The Energy Department said it did not see an imminent threat to
the United States or an immediate price runup, and said it had no
planws to tap the nation's emergency oil stockpile.
   ``Iraq being the dominant military power in the area could end
up controlling ... a quarter of world oil supplies,'' said
Christopher Flavin, a vice president of the Worldwatch Institute.
``Just overnight it doubled its share.''
   By grabbing control of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
added about 94 billion barrels of oil reserves to his country's own
100 billion barrels. That makes Iraq second only to Saudi Arabia in
world ranking for oil reserves, according to the American Petroleum
Institute, an industry trade group.
   The Saudis, traditional close allies of Kuwait, have 255 billion
barrels of oil reserves.
   The United States holds about 26 billion barrels of reserves.
But U.S. oil production has declined rapidly over the past four
years while consumption has increased. As a result, 50 percent of
oil used in the United States is imported, and many experts say
this reliance makes America vulnerable to manipulation of the oil
market.
   The top 10 U.S. oil suppliers are Saudi Arabia, which provides
15 percent of imports; Venezuela, 13 percent; Nigeria, 12.5
percent; Canada, 12 percent; Iraq, 7.6 percent; Mexico, 6 percent;
Virgin Islands, 3.6 percent; and Britain, Angola and Algeria a
combined 9.7 percent. Kuwait supplies about 2 percent.
   Like Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates at the southern end of the
gulf are vulnerable to Iraqi military might. The Emirates control
about 100 billion barrels of oil reserves and were the recent
target of Iraqi verbal assaults against excessive oil production by
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   President Bush signed an order Thursday banning U.S. imports of
Iraqi products, including oil, freezing control of Iraqi financial
assets in the United States and forbidding exports to Iraq _ a
complete trade embargo.
   Iraq's oil should be easily replaceable from other sources since
one barrel of oil is pretty much equivalent to any other barrel,
especially in a time of glutted oil markets like the present,
analysts say. Iraq, by the same token, should be able to find other
sources of wheat and rice it may no longer buy from the United
States under Bush's order, unless other nations also ban exports to
Iraq.
   Oil prices on the world market jumped sharply in reaction to the
Iraqi invasion, but Flavin and other analysts said the more
unsettling implication of Saddam's action is his expanded clout in
the gulf and his influence over future supplies.
   The Saudis, the world's largest oil exporters and the No. 1
supplier to the United States, ``are sitting there quaking in their
boots'' out of fear that Saddam might invade their kingdom or seek
a voice in running their oil affairs, said Dillard Spriggs,
president of New York-based Petroleum Analysis Ltd.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the Iraqi army might not stop
at Kuwait's borders.
   ``If Iraq succeeds, I believe that Saudi Arabia might be next _
and then Saddam Hussein would have a stranglehold on the West's oil
supply,'' Bentsen said.
   Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, told the
congressional Joint Economic Committee that the U.S. economy was
not threatened by the impact of Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, even if
it led to a 25 percent jump in oil prices.
   Boskin conceded that such a large rise in prices would cause
some economic damage in the United States but said it would be more
harmful to Japan because of its greater dependence on oil imports.
Japan gets virtually all its oil from foreign sources.
   Also on Capitol Hill, the Senate extended by one month Bush's
authority to tap into the 580-million barrel Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, an emergency oil storage system, in the event of a supply
squeeze. The Senate action was not directly linked to the Iraqi
invasion, but senators said the gulf crisis served to underscore
the fragile nature of Middle East oil production and transportation.
   ``All of the OPEC countries _ at least all of those in the
Middle East _ will be intimidated by Iraq,'' said Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee. ``Iraq will be able to set such prices as it
wants.''
   Henson Moore, the deputy secretary of energy, told reporters at
Energy Department headquarters that the administration was not
considering tapping into the emergency reserve, which he said
contains the equivalent of 75 days worth of oil consumption.
   ``We do not see ... any imminent threat to the United States''
by the loss of Iraqi oil, Moore said. ``Nor do we see any long-term
significant increase in prices.''

   Gov. Bill Clements declared the effects
of a 500,000-gallon oil spill were ``greatly exaggerated'' as a
health department ban against fishing the rich Galveston Bay went
into effect Thursday.
   Clements, a former oil man, toured the bay by helicopter, and
initially decided to cancel a plan to use oil-eating microbes on
the slick.
   His announcement shocked state officials, and he later backed
down and decided to allow limited application of the process called
bioremediation.
   Meanwhile, salvage crews found about 20,000 gallons of oil in a
tank aboard a ruptured barge nearly sunken in the Houston Ship
Channel since the collision Saturday with a Greek tanker.
   The Coast Guard again shut down traffic in the channel to allow
crews time to remove the fragile barge. Officials said earlier in
the week the delays were costing ship owners at least $1.5 million
per day.
   The Coast Guard took over cleanup efforts Thursday because Apex
Towing Co., owner of the two barges damaged in the collision, was
nearing its insurance liability limit.
   ``We call the shots now and we pay the bills,'' said Chief
Warrant Officer Rick Meidt. The Coast Guard will bill Apex Towing
Co. for the cleanup costs.
   After his tour Thursday, Clements said: ``I think that the
so-called oil spill has been greatly exaggerated. We had difficulty
finding any.''
   Officials had gained federal approval to use bioremediation to
help clear delicate marshlands of a filmy, black oil, but Clements
said the oil had dispersed too much for the microbes to be
effective in most areas.
   His statement seemed to contradict the judgment of the Texas
Health Department, which the day before had ordered the bay closed
to all fishing for fear of contamination from the oil.
   Texas General Land Commissioner Garry Mauro was outraged.
   ``We know that skimmers, booms and dispersants will not save
Galveston Bay. The only technology that holds even a promise is
bioremediation,'' Mauro said.
   Clements later reversed himself, and decided to allow 100 pounds
of microbes mixed with water to be pumped onto two areas of Pelican
Island, adjacent to Galveston Island.
   Coast Guard officials said Thursday the oil sheen has thinned to
a 12-mile stretch throughout the bay, with heavier patches around
Redfish Island, Pelican Island, Texas City Dike, Eagle Point and
Port Bolivar.
   ``We're fortunate,'' Clements said. ``We're blessed that it has
turned out this way. It's not near as serious a problem as was
first anticipated.''
   The bay contains the nation's seventh largest estuary system,
with rich banks of shrimp, crabs, oysters and valuable fish.
   Bay shrimpers put out of work by the fishing ban said they were
skeptical of Clements' views.
   ``I hope he's right, but realistically, I think he's full of
baloney,'' said C.L. Standley, a former president of Professional
Involvement of Seafood Concerned Enterprises.
   Clements said he expected the fishing ban would be lifted soon.
   ``It's not really as bad as we thought,'' he said.
   But Standley disagreed. ``I think it could possibly be weeks,
and if it is, that's going to be devastating,'' he said.
   The bay's commercial fishing industry generates $240 million
annually, and its recreational fishing industry generates $170
million annually, said David Hankla, field supervisor for the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
   With Galveston Bay closed, fishing boats will have to move to
other Gulf of Mexico inlets or out to the gulf itself.
   In another development, the captain of the Greek tanker,
testifying for the second day at a federal inquiry into the
collision that caused the spill, again blamed the accident on a
Houston pilot.
   Capt. Nikolos Fioratos testified that the pilot ordered the
Shinoussa to travel too fast through the ship channel, then told
him to tell authorities that the accident happened because the
channel was too narrow.
   The hearing is being held by the National Transportation Safety
Board and the Coast Guard.

<HEAD>Soviets Draft Soldiers, Civilian Trucks, KGB For Harvest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet government is drafting tens of
thousands of soldiers, 10 to 15 percent of the nation's civilian
trucks, and even the KGB to harvest a huge grain crop, the Soviet
news agency Tass said Thursday.
   It said the crop was so large it has overwhelmed the nation's
ability to collect it all.
   Soviet officials are so worried about losing any of the
unexpectedly big crop that some suggested declaring a nationwide
state of emergency, Tass said. Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
rejected the idea Thursday.
   The grain crop is now expected to reach 260 million tons. That's
a mind-boggling figure for Soviets, whose previous record was last
year's 211 million tons. No reason has been given for this year's
rise in harvest figures.
   The Soviets are already losing 2 million tons a day because they
cannot harvest and store it quickly enough, said Vladilen Nikitin,
head of the state food commission.
   Soviet media have blamed shortages of fuel, trucks and storage
space, as well as the centrally planned economy's inability to
adjust to the demand. The country annual loses 20 to 30 percent of
its food crop on the way to market.
   The government has already sent 70 army battalions with 35,000
trucks to help with the harvest. Another 20 battalions with 10,000
trucks will be added, Tass said.
   Ryzhkov said 10 to 15 percent of the nation's trucks will also
be drawn into the harvest campaign, regardless of their ownership,
Tass said.
   The KGB state security agency and the Interior Ministry also
will be asked to contribute resources, Tass said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush froze Iraq's assets in this
country and cut off imports of 588,000 barrels a day of Iraqi oil
Thursday in retaliation for the lightning invasion of Kuwait. U.S.
officials were seeking word on American oil workers missing in the
region.
   Kuwait's ambassador appealed for American military help for his
country but none was forthcoming, at least for the moment. Bush
said, ``We're not ruling any options in but we're not ruling any
options out.''
   A State Department official disclosed that the invading Iraqi
troops rounded up and moved ``a few'' American oil field workers
from just inside Kuwait's border. He said their whereabouts were
not known.
   ``We are making every effort to make inquiries and find out
more,'' said the official, who commented on condition he not be
identified.
   The president, in blocking virtually all commerce with Iraq,
denounced its ``naked aggression'' against a small neighbor. Some
members of Congress compared Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to Hitler
and said they believed the American people would accept higher fuel
prices resulting from an attempt to strangle Iraq economically.
   Bush flew to Aspen, Colo. to deliver a speech appealing for
keeping America strong enough militarily to respond to terrorism,
hostage taking and ``renegade regimes and unpredictable rulers.''
   He said Iraq's ``brutal aggression'' made his point _ that
despite the lessening of the Soviet threat in recent months,
``threats can arise suddenly, unpredictably, and from unexpected
quarters.''
   Bush conferred in Colorado with the vacationing British prime
minister, Margaret Thatcher. He arranged to return to Washington
earlier than planned.
   Mrs. Thatcher, referring to Saddam, said, ``We find his behavior
intolerable.'' She called for collective action by the member
states of the United Nations.
   Bush said he conferred by telephone with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and other Arab leaders, and said he was encouraged by
their efforts to find an ``Arab answer'' to the problem.
   Later, Bush spoke for a half-hour by telephone with King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia, said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
and ``they agreed that the attack on Kuwait was absolutely
unacceptable.''
   Out for a walk, Bush was asked by reporters what he talked about
with the king. Bush replied, ``just reviewing options ... going to
have some meetings over there.''
   Before leaving Washington, Bush said the United States would do
whatever more is necessary ``to defend our longstanding, vital
interests'' in the Persian Gulf. He said he and his advisers would
``consider all possible options available to us.''
   But he wasn't specific and said he wasn't discussing military
intervention _ a course which experts said offered no easy choices
to him. He added that he wouldn't talk publicly about military
options in any event.
   ``We don't stand a chance if we don't get any aid from our
friends,'' a dismayed Ambassador Saud Nasser Al-Sabah told
reporters. ``U.S. intervention at this stage is of paramount
importance.''
   As an alternative, Bush took one of the toughest economic
options open to him. He froze control of Iraqi assets in the United
States _ and of Kuwait's assets, too, so they wouldn't fall into
Iraqi hands.
   And he halted commerce between the United States and Iraq, a
nation that normally provides the United States with 588,000
barrels of oil a day _ 7.6 percent of U.S. imports.
   Administration officials said they could not estimate the value
of Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets affected by the freeze, but one
Treasury official described them as ``significant.''
   After a morning of closed briefings, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said if Iraq headed
for Saudi Arabia and its oil fields just 250 miles across the
desert, ``I think it would be a direct threat to the security of
this country.''
   Saddam must calculate whether his nation, weary from its long
war with Iran, is willing to support further miltary adventures,
Boren said. A possible invasion by Iraq of Saudi Arabia ``cannot be
ruled out,'' he said.
   And Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, expressed fear that if the
Iraqi takeover of Kuwait succeeds ``Saudi Arabia might be next _
and then Saddam Hussein would have a stranglehold on the West's oil
supply.''
   The Texan said the United States should seek a worldwide embargo
against Iraqi oil. ``Iraq is deeply in debt and very dependent on
oil revenues and such an embargo would be an effective way to get
their attention,'' he said.
   The timing of the invasion appeared to have caught many
officials off guard. Bush said he had not been taken totally by
surprise.
   ``We had good intelligence and our intelligence has had me
concerned for some time now,'' he said.
   ``We provided policymakers with very useful and timely
information on these events,'' the CIA said in an unusual statement
denying it had been caught unawares. ``There were no surprises.''
   Boren also said many in the administration and Congress had
``engaged in wishful thinking'' when they believed that Saddam's
only aim was to force Kuwait to lower its oil production and
thereby move oil prices upward.
   Reflecting the anger boiling up on Capitol Hill, Rep. Ike
Skelton, D-Mo., told the House, ``The attack is a financial assault
on America and on the rest of the world that is dependent on
Mideastern oil.''
   The House gave speedy 416-0 approval to a pending economic
sanctions bill aimed at Iraq. The measure would cut off Iraq's $200
million a year in Export-Import Bank credits and tighten
restrictions on U.S. exports that could have military as well as
civilian uses.
   Pentagon sources also said an evacuation of 3,000 Americans,
mostly business people, from Kuwait was under consideration. About
130 are U.S. employees.
   The State Department said U.S. Embassy personnel were safe and
the embassy grounds had not been penetrated during the fighting,
but it advised Americans to postpone travel to Kuwait.
   The aircraft carrier USS Independence and six escorts were
directed to head toward the region from the Indian Ocean but were
several days from reaching a ``striking distance'' position outside
the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said.
   An eight-ship force deployed on maneuvers earlier was still in
the gulf but not equipped for any type of land assault.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said, ``We do not have aircraft within striking distance
unless we fly land-based, long-range bombers into that region. And
I do not think the time is now for us to talk about military force.
We would not want to get into a ground war in that area.''
   Bush, in his first public reaction, called for ``the immediate
and unconditional withdrawal of all the Iraqi forces'' and said:
``There is no place for this sort of naked aggression in today's
world.''
   ``You're dealing with a madman here,'' Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., said of Saddam. ``I'm not sure he's going to respond to
sanctions.''
   Presidential economic adviser Michael Boskin told Congress that
the U.S. economy should be able to withstand any foreseeable
increase in oil prices. Even a 25 percent rise in oil prices would
likely have only a modest adverse impact on U.S. economic growth,
he said.
   The United States gets half of its oil from abroad, and 10
percent from Iraqi and Kuwait. America imported about $2.4 billion
in oil and other goods last year from Iraq, while U.S. exports to
Iraq, chiefly agricultural commodities, totaled $1.17 billion in
1989.

   Most of the approximately 3,000 Americans living
in Kuwait work in the oil or construction industries, the State
Department said Thursday.
   Invading Iraqi troops rounded up six American oil field workers
near the border of Kuwait, the department said in a statement.
Their whereabouts were unknown.
   Iraq seized control of some the Persian Gulf kingdom's rich oil
fields during its blitzkrieg invasion Wednesday.
   Texaco Inc. operates an oil refinery under a 50-50 joint venture
with Kuwait Oil Co. in a ``neutral zone'' in southwestern Kuwait
next to Saudi Arabia. It is the only U.S.-owned refinery operating
in Iraq or Kuwait.
   Texaco spokeswoman Anita Larsen said 17 Americans are among 800
employees there. All were reported safe earlier in the day, and the
refinery was running, she said. Many of the employees have family
with them, but Larsen said she did not know the exact number.
   Major Middle East contractors such as Houston-based Brown &amp; Root
currently have no American employees in the area, company officials
said.
   The U.S. government employees 130 people in Kuwait, mainly at
its embassy, said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. All
were reported safe after the invasion, he said.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said its several dozen employees in
Kuwait include Americans, Canadians and British.
   Other contractors in the area, including Bechtel International
of San Francisco, did not return phone calls Thursday seeking
comment about their employees.
   More than 60 percent of Kuwait's 1.8 million residents are
foreigners. About half the population was believed to be outside
the country for summer holidays.
   Many of the Americans work as consultants for small contracting
firms, officials said.
   A Middle East expert said it was unlikely U.S. citizens would be
singled out for violence.
   ``I don't think Americans and Western business people are really
at risk at all,'' said Dr. Kofi Afriyie of Rutgers University.
``Look at their motivation. Iraq wants to increase its own oil
revenues ... If they incur the displeasure of Western countries, it
would defeat its own purpose.''

<HEAD>House Approves Airport User Fees for Passengers</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: ADDs two grafs of negative votes and those not voting in lieu

   The House on Thursday approved passenger user
fees at airports as a way of financing new gates, runways and other
construction designed to cut increasing congestion and delays.
   Fees would be limited to $3 per passenger at each airport, with
a ceiling of $12 per passenger for one round-trip.
   ``This bill will bring our air transport system into the 21st
century,'' said Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., as the House voted
252-171 to defeat an effort to drop the user fees from the
legislation.
   The House then approved the bill 405-15.
   The measure would authorize $17 billion over two years for
airport operations and development. It calls for spending more than
$6 billion in the Aviation Trust Fund over the next five years to
upgrade airports.
   The Senate has taken no action on the plan.
   House members clashed over the provision authorizing local
airports to impose fees on passengers. Whether to impose such fees
would be a decision made by local officials, subject to regulation
by the federal Department of Transportation.
   Improvements are needed to ease crowding and delays caused by an
increase in airline passengers from 266 million in 1978 to 480
million last year. Authorities are forecasting an increase to 750
million within 10 years.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and other Chicagoans said that a
third major airport to service the city could not be built without
the passenger charge. The new airport is estimated to cost $4.9
billion.
   But critics said the fees would benefit only a few cities with
major construction projects on the drawing board _ especially
Chicago _ and that most travelers would reap no benefits from the
airport improvements.
   ``Aviation passengers are being taken for a ride by the White
House and Congress,'' said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif.
   A study by airport associations has suggested that $10 billion a
year would be needed for the next five years to overcome congestion
at many of the nation's major airports. The Transportation
Department has generally accepted the estimate.
   Rep. William F. Clinger Jr., R-Pa., said the critics had
provided no alternative way to meet the costs.
   ``They can hope the tooth fairy will, under cover of night,
extend the runway or build the new terminal,'' Clinger said.
   These members voted against the bill: Reps. Jim Bates, D-Calif.;
Douglas H. Bosco, D-Calif.; Gary Condit, D-Calif.; Norman Mineta,
D-Calif.; William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; George Sangmeister,
D-Ill.; Philip M. Crane, R-Ill.; Lynn Martin, R-Ill.; Andrew Jacobs
Jr., D-Ind.; David Bonior, D-Mich.; Bob Carr, D-Mich.; George W.

   Canadian Kathy McGregor said from Kuwait
that one explosion was close enough to shake her house when Iraqi
forces invaded the small sultanate before dawn on Thursday.
   ``You know when you see a movie, when people dive for cover? We
did it. The explosion blew inside the house, shaking it,'' the
32-year-old Ms. McGregor reported by telephone.
   ``It's chaos, military jets are flying over all the time,'' she
added, looking out her window.
   She said that later Thursday, the violence of war lifted
considerably _ ``There is not much noise or gunfire. I feel better
with more people around now.''
   Other expatriates, also reached by telephone from Bahrain, said
they heard gunfire, explosions and jets and helicopters overhead as
the Iraqis moved in.
   ``We were totally unprepared. One feels like there should have
been a bit of warning,'' said 37-year-old Catherine Baker of
Illinois, an employee of a British design firm in Kuwait.
   She said it was ``unbelievable. ... It doesn't seem real.''
   About 3,000 Americans are among the large expatriate community
in Kuwait, where more than 60 percent of the 1.9 million residents
are foreigners.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said no Americans were
reported harmed.
   Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf estimated that more than
200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded in the invasion.
   The British Embassy was hit by shellfire and the Sheraton and
Hilton hotels evacuated their guests, diplomats reported.
   Serge Sejournet, 30, an artist from Paris, said, ``I think it
will be over soon, somehow. I don't think I want to get out of
Kuwait.'' He said he thought the United States would ``bring the
situation under control.''
   Sejournet said Iraqi soldiers on the street in front of his home
in downtown Kuwait were ``very friendly with everyone, saying hello
to all.''
   He, Ms. Baker and other expatriates said they gathered in homes
of friends, listening to the fighting.
   Herb Linnen, a spokesman for AT&amp;T, said in Washington that calls
to Kuwait reached 2,000 every five minutes. Friends and relatives
of those living in Kuwait found it hard or impossible to contact
them.
   Linnen said the company itself got through only once to its
employees in Kuwait on Thursday and ascertained that the dozens of
workers and their families were safe.
   The State Department set up a 24-hour hotline for people seeking
information about the safety of American relatives and friends in
Kuwait and Iraq. The number is (202) 647-0900.

   The Senate on Thursday left intact President
Bush's 1991 budget request for the B-2 bomber but imposed
restrictions on the $4.6 billion until critical tests on the
stealth aircraft have been conducted.
   By a vote of 97-2, the Senate adopted the amendment to the $289
billion defense bill as Republicans fought to salvage the aircraft
and GOP leader Bob Dole argued that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was
the ``wake-up call'' against deep cuts in defense spending.
   Just moments later, proponents of the B-2 narrowly managed to
fight off the most serious effort yet to gut the program. An
amendment that would have stalled the program at 15 planes already
authorized failed, 53-45.
   ``This just about defeats the program,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a supporter of the
B-2, warned shortly before the vote.
   The measure's sponsor, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, argued
against the bomber, citing the expensive cost of a single plane _
$865 million _ and the Justice Department's recommendation that the
manufacturer, Northrop Corp., be prohibited from future defense
contracts due to fraud charges.
   ``Let's fund what we have on line right now but no more B-2s
until you prove them,'' Cohen said.
   The Senate action comes on the heels of the House Armed Services
Committee's adoption of a $283 billion defense bill that halts
production of the program at the 15 planes.
   Opponents of the plane have argued that since the Cold War has
ended and the budget deficit has grown the plane's worth is
questionable.
   The Senate did approve an amendment, sponsored by Nunn and the
panel's ranking Republican, Sen. John Warner of Virginia, that
calls for the plane to pass 13 requirements before about $2 billion
in procurement money can be spent. Ten of those tests were included
in last year's defense bill.
   All total, the administration is seeking $4.6 billion for two
B-2 bombers in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   ``I understand the case against the B-2. All of us are suffering
from sticker shock,'' Nunn said on the Senate floor.
   But the panel chairman argued that the plane is ``indeed a
revolutionary change in capability to conduct air warfare.''
   In its bill, the House panel also slashed nearly $2 billion from
Bush's request for the Strategic Defense Initiative as it adopted a
defense package that chops $24 billion from Bush's Pentagon budget
of $307 billion for fiscal 1991.
   In the wake of the cuts, the Bush administration was relying on
the Senate to salvage its prized weapons programs, including the
B-2 bomber and SDI.
   In its bill, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved the
president's proposal for two B-2 bombers in fiscal 1991 and trimmed
$1 billion from the budget for SDI, or Star Wars.
   The first Senate vote on the B-2 bomber followed the Senate GOP
leader's prediction.
   ``I think this vote ought to be overwhelming today,'' Dole said
during the afternoon of debate. ``Maybe yesterday it might have
been close but we need something to wake us up from time to time.
We need a wake-up call. We need to be alerted that we're not going
to be able to control the events in the world.''
   The Air Force envisions the B-2 bomber to be used after a
nuclear missile war, to seek out the remaining targets in the
Soviet Union.
   Warner argued that the government has already invested more than
$26 billion, and terminating the program at 15 planes would
increase the per unit cost to more than $2.3 billion per plane.
   Later in the evening, the Senate rejected an amendment that
would have prohibited using U.S. dollars in the NATO Infrastructure
Fund for a new air base in Crotone, Italy, to house the 401st
Tactical Wing. The vote was 51-47.
   The House Armed Services Committee earlier this week banned the
use of American money for the installation made necessary by
Spain's decision to force out the 72 F-16 jet fighters from
Torrejon de Ardoz.
   The Senate vote came after Warner said he had just received a
telephone call from Gen. John Galvin, head of the European command,
who argued that if he was left with only two bases, one had to be
in Crotone.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday was
condemned around the world, with rival nations uniting in calls for
Iraq to withdraw its forces from its Persian Gulf neighbor.
   At least two Arab nations cautioned against outside
intervention, however, in response to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's takeover of oil-rich Kuwait. Other fellow Arab states
were reluctant to speak against Iraq.
   The United Nations demanded Iraq's immediate and unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait. China, Iran, Australia and Algeria were
among nations echoing the call.
   NATO officials met in Brussels and the United States said it was
``reviewing all options.'' Israel said it was ready to meet any
military threat posed by Iraq.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's largest arms supplier, suspended
shipments, according to the Soviet news agency Tass. The United
States, which gets 5 percent of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait,
slapped an embargo on Iraqi oil.
   The United States, France and Britain froze Kuwaiti assets to
protect them from Iraq, and the United States and France froze
Iraqi assets as well. Switzerland ordered its banks to increase
vigilance over Kuwaiti assets to prevent their seizure.
   Kuwait's U.S. ambassador, Sheikh Saud Nasir al-Sabah, appealed
for U.S. military assistance ``in order to survive.''
   But Libya said any foreign intervention would be considered ``an
aggressive act.'' Jordan's official news agency said King Hussein
was also concerned about avoiding foreign intervention.
   Iran, which fought an eight-year war with Iraq, condemned the
invasion and called for immediate Iraqi withdrawal. A Foreign
Ministry statement warned that Iran ``cannot remain indifferent to
any development which could endanger her national security and
regional stability.''
   The Arab League Council met in emergency session in Cairo to
consider a Kuwaiti demand to send a joint Arab force ``to defend
Kuwait against the Iraqi invasion,'' Egypt's state-run Middle East
News Agency reported.
   But the council adjourned without condemning the overthrow, the
first by one Arab nation against another in modern history.
   In Washington, President Bush called the invasion ``naked
aggression'' but said ``we're not discussing'' military
intervention. Nonetheless, a Defense Department source said a naval
battle group was being diverted to the region.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, meeting with Bush
near Aspen, Colo., said ``we need a collective and effective will
of the nations belonging to the U.N.'' to resolve the conflict.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France said in a TV interview
that the Security Council resolution, co-sponsored by France, was
``the prelude to the leveling of sanctions.''
   France, Iraq's second-largest supplier, had already suspended
arms deliveries because Baghdad failed to pay about $4.5 billion in
debts, Dumas said.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said it is ``perfectly
clear that collective measures will be necessary if the Security
Council resolution is not complied with.''
   He called the new government of Kuwait ``a puppet regime.''
   Within the Arab world, the invasion prompted urgent
consultations.
   Hussein flew to Alexandria for consulations with Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak. Both talked to Bush, Saddam, Saudi
President King Fahd and Yemeni President Ali Abdallah Saleh by
telephone, the Egyptian news agency reported. It gave no details.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi telephoned leaders of Saudi
Arabia and Tunisia on Thursday to discuss the crisis, according to
a Libyan Radio broadcast monitored in London.
   ``Foreign intervention on the part of imperialist powers is
something which we utterly reject because Arabs are capable of
resolving problems on their own,'' Libya's foreign minister said in
a statement broadcast by Libyan Radio.
   Hamed el-Ghabid, secretary-general of the 45-national
Organization of Islamic Conference, issued a statement in Cairo
asking Iraq to withdraw. ``What is going on is of great danger for
the security, stability and peace of the whole gulf region,'' he
said.
   Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens said the attack proved
Saddam was ``a threat to the entire world.'' He said Israel was
ready to meet any military threat posed by Iraq but would not take
action unless attacked.
   Statements of condemnation were issued by the 12-nation European
Community, by Austria, Singapore, Romania, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Algeria, Venezuela, Mexico, Turkey, Norway, Morocco and Niger.
   China said ``no one should resort to force of arms in resolving
their disputes,'' and Japan, which is heavily dependent on Persian
Gulf oil, expressed hope for a peaceful solution.
   Oil prices jumped on fears the conflict would disrupt oil
supplies. Late Thursday's price was more than $22 a barrel, up from
$15.85 on July 12.
   Lloyd's of London, the insurer, introduced war risk premiums for
shipping in the Persian Gulf for the first time since the Iran-Iraq
war. The fighting ended in 1988.

   Occupying Iraqi troops have adopted the Sheraton
Hotel in a Kuwaiti suburb as their interim headquarters, eschewing
the government buildings they seized earlier Thursday for the
hotel's more comfortable lodgings.
   Much has changed overnight in this capital since tank-led Iraqi
troops crossed the border 80 miles away before dawn and charged
into Kuwait. Iraq issued a statement in Baghdad saying the troops
were in Kuwait at the request of a revolutionary council.
   Most people here seemed unaware what revolutionary council had
called for their government's ouster.
   Instead, scenes from the occupied city Thursday bordered on the
bizarre:
   _In one area of the city, about 30 Kuwaitis stood patiently in
line, waiting to rent videocassette movies for the night. The
reason, in the words of one woman, is that most residents are
staying at home ``sitting tight.''
   _Many Kuwait autos have been left in the streets, some not even
parked but merely abandoned as if the drivers saw the approaching
troops and fled. Roads and sidewalks in parts of the city have been
damaged and churned up by the hundreds of tanks that entered Kuwait.
   _Some of the Iraqi troops have been seen driving around the
capital in newly confiscated Kuwaiti police cars.
   _At a circular intersection, Iraqi troops mill about, sitting,
eating and talking; ground rocket-launchers stand idle nearby,
ready to be fired if necessary. About 100 soldiers meander about
outside the newly occupied Sheraton Hotel, in groups of 10.
   _In downtown Kuwait, the streets are largely deserted, with none
of the usual bustle of taxis and buses. Only in the suburbs do
local residents dare to go outside for long, though some are still
fearful of further incidents with the invading forces. Life in the
suburbs however seems basically normal.
   _The only sign of domestic unrest was spot panic-buying in the
supermarkets, where residents shopped quickly and headed right home.

   Congress moved rapidly Thursday to endorse
President Bush's economic sanctions against Iraq, and some
lawmakers said they would support U.S. military action if it is
coordinated with allies in the Middle East.
   Lawmakers said they believed the American public would support a
total cutoff of U.S. economic ties with Iraq even it it meant a
short-term increase in fuel prices, because of fears that an
unstable ruler could gain a long-term strangehold on Persian Gulf
oil supplies.
   ``You're talking about something that could totally unravel the
whole Middle East,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``Talk about
the analogy of the fuse being lit, it's being lit in Kuwait.''
   Some Democrats welcomed Bush's tough embargo but questioned why
he had not acted sooner. They said a policy of ``appeasement'' by
Bush and President Reagan, his predecessor, might have emboldened
Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait.
   ``The administration, finally, this morning, as a result of the
invasion, has a good policy,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
   Berman's proposed legislation to impose economic sanctions on
Iraq, strengthened by Bush's executive order, was sent on a fast
track to the House floor, where it was approved on a 416-0 vote.
   One lawmaker, Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., voted ``present''
because he said the action was too hasty and included a grain
embargo like the ill-fated 1980 ban imposed by President Carter
against the Soviet Union.
   The bill also would cut off Iraq's $200 million in annual
Export-Import Bank credits and tighten restrictions on U.S. exports
that could have either civilian or military uses.
   ``We want to indicate through legislation that we are in full
support of the president's action,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell,
D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Later, the Senate voted 97-0 for a resolution condemning the
invasion, praising Bush's sanctions and calling for a worldwide
boycott of Iraqi oil and an end to arms sales as part of a full
economic blockade. If those measures fail to pressure Iraq to leave
Kuwait, the United Nations should pursue multilateral military
actions, it said.
   Berman said Americans will be willing to make economic
sacrifices to show their opposition to Iraq's invasion.
   ``In the end, I don't think the people of the United States want
to appease a bully'' to ensure the uninterrupted flow of Mideast
oil, Berman said. If unchecked, he said, Saddam could take ``total
control'' of the region's oil reserves.
   But in a sense, that may already have happened, said Rep.
Matthew McHugh, D-N.Y. Iraq's powerful presence in Kuwait may
intimidate Saudi Arabia, the peninsula's largest oil producer, into
going along with any oil policy dictated from Baghdad, he said.
   ``The Saudis are going to be very cautious'' about stepping up
production to stabilize prices, said McHugh, a member of the House
Intelligence Committee. They may not do so without a promise of
U.S. support if attacked, he suggested.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said it was too early to
say what military steps the United States might take. But Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, held open the option of a military response.
   ``Together with our friends in the region, we should consider
defensive military measures that might be needed to guard against
any further Iraqi aggression,'' Bentsen said, cautioning that ``I
don't foresee the need for U.S. combat involvement.''
   Instead, Bentsen urged a worldwide embargo on purchases of Iraqi
oil.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and some other legislators said
military action in coordination with gulf allies eventually might
be necessary.
   ``You're dealing with a madman here,'' said Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., likening Saddam to Adolf Hitler. ``I'm not sure he's
going to respond to sanctions.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said Bush had acted ``boldly and
comprehensively'' in severing U.S. trade with Iraq and freezing the
U.S. assets of Iraq and Kuwait.
   But Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., accused Bush of a ``policy of
appeasement'' toward Iraq. ``There was a total misjudgment of the
policies and goals of Saddam Hussein to the very moment his troops
invaded a neighboring country,'' he said.
   Added Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif.: ``Many have been urging this
administration to take Saddam Hussein much more seriously than they
have.''
   Berman said problems began when Reagan ``tilted'' in favor of
Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran, urging U.S. allies to arm
the Baghdad government while overlooking Iraq's human rights
violations and support for terrorism.
   Foley said it would be ``foolish'' to think the invasion could
have been averted if Bush had ordered sanctions earlier.

<TEXT>
   THE INVASION: Iraq's troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the
border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and
government buildings 40 miles away. Early Friday, the invaders
controlled Kuwait city, the capital. The soldiers were also making
sweeps through the southern oilfields, according to residents and
Lloyds' insurance service in London. Diplomatic sources estimate
more than 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded, mainly from the
Emiri Guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion. Kuwait's
Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah fled to safety in Saudi Arabia.
   
   THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the
Arab world's most battle-trained army, and had massed more than
100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border. Kuwait, an oil-rich
city-state, has 1.9 million residents _ 60 percent foreigners _ and
an army of 20,300 soldiers.
   
   CAUSE OF CONFLICT: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq accused
Kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil
prices through overproduction. Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismissed
Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti
revolutionaries.
   
   REACTION: The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the
invasion.
   President Bush denounced it as ``naked agression.'' He froze
Iraq's assets in the United States and blocked almost all Iraqi
imports, including oil. The order also froze Kuwait property under
U.S. jurisdiction _ a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it.
   The Soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales
to Iraq.
   Kuwait's U.S. ambassador said the nation had asked for American
military intervention.
   A Pentagon source said a U.S. naval group was diverted toward
the Persian Gulf.
   Oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion
would reduce the supply of oil.

   Eight American oil field workers were reported
missing near the border of Kuwait and company officials suspected
they had been picked up by the invading Iraqi army, the State
Department said on Thursday.
   The whereabouts of the eight were unknown.
   ``Our embassy in Baghdad has asked the government of Iraq for
information on the whereabouts of these ... American citizens,
reminding the government of Iraq of its commitment to respect the
security and welfare of U.S. citizens,'' the department said in an
unattributed statement.
   Word of the detention came from a U.S. oil company for whom the
eight worked, and the department asserted it was not at liberty to
identify that company or any of the eight because of provisions of
the Privacy Act.
   A State Department official said the company reported the
roundup by the Iraqis, but the United States has not been able to
confirm whether that is what happened.
   Texaco Inc. is the only U.S. oil company with operations in
Kuwait. Texaco has 17 Americans among 800 employees working in the
joint Saudi Arabian-Kuwaiti neutral zone, said spokeswoman Anita
Larsen in New York.
   The spokeswoman said all 17 had been reported safe earlier in
the day.
   Meanwhile, a Texas television station identified one of the
eight as Charles Amos of Gilmer, an employee of Santa Fe Drilling
Co. of California. Amos' family was notified by the State
Department on Thursday morning, according to the report on KLTV-TV.
   A short time before a State Department official disclosed the
suspected roundup, President Bush was asked about reports that
American workers in Kuwait had been rounded up.
   ``I don't have anything on that right now,'' he said.
``Secondly, it would affect us in a very dramatic way because I
view a fundamental responsibility of my presidency is protecting
American citizens. If they're put into harm's way I have certain
responsibilities.''
   An estimated 3,000 Americans live in Kuwait, many of them with
ties to the oil business.
   Iraqi troops seized control of some of Kuwait's rich oil fields
during their blitzkrieg invasion of the Persian Gulf kingdom on
Wednesday.
   Officials did not want to conclude that the eight workers had
been taken hostage.
   ``All we know is that they are missing,'' said a U.S. official
who asked not to be further identified. ``They are in a situation
where we are very concerned about there whereabouts. But at this
point we are not drawing conclusions.''

<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP) The House began debate on a major civil rights
bill Thursday and voted to put a ceiling on punitive damages that
courts can award to women who are victims of intentional job
discrimination.
   ``This will lay the unfounded fears to rest,'' said the chairman
of the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, said as the
House approved the cap, 289-134.
   Punitive damages for women, religious minorities and the
disabled could be no more than $150,000 or the amount of
compensatory damages awarded by the court, whichever is larger.
   The House worked into the night Thursday on the but put off a
vote on passage and other major floor action until Friday.
   The bill is the top item on the civil rights community's
congressional shopping list and would effectively reverse five
Supreme Court decisions last year. It is advancing under threat of
a presidential veto, with the Bush administration saying it would
lead to hiring quotas for members of minority groups.
   Provisions range from a ban on racial harrassment in the
workplace to barriers against reopening court-approved fair-hiring
plans.
   The most controversial provisions would make it easier for those
claiming to be victims of job discrimination to win lawsuits
against employers based on statistics.
   The ceiling on damages was designed to ease business concerns
about the potential for huge, open-ended jury awards for women
victimized by discrimination. It also was aimed at winning support
among southern Democrats.
   Liberal sponsors of the bill split over the issue. Rep. Don
Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the civil rights subcommittee of the
Judiciary Committee, voted against it. Education and Labor
Committee Chairman Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., voted for it.
   ``The southern Democrats voted with us on this cap and most of
them will now support us'' when the House turns to a major
amendment that would limit not only punitive but all damages to
$100,000, said Hawkins.
   That proposal has been championed by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y.,
and has been praised by the Bush administration as a step away from
quotas. Sponsors say it would wreck the bill.
   Hawkins said sponsors would beat back the LaFalce amendment by
``a whopping good vote.''
   Women's groups have been opposing such ceilings, saying they
would be unfair in view of unlimited punitive damages allowed in
the case of deliberate racial discrimination in the workplace.
   The House earlier had approved, 397-24, an amendment making
clear that no hiring quotas would be required under the bill.
Similar language was included in the measure when it was approved
by the Judiciary Committee, but lawmakers wanted a chance to vote
on it separately.
   Republican critics scoffed that the no-quotas amendment amounted
to nothing more than a cosmetic exercize. ``I can't believe the
charade of it all,'' declared Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.
   Civil rights forces scoff at the charge that the bill would lead
to quotas.
   ``If anyone raises the subject of quotas, I want to know where
it is,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. ``There is no reference to
quotas in this bill.''
   Women's groups have been crusading against the LaFalce measure,
noting that there is no cap on damages that courts can now award to
victims of racial discrimination in the workplace.
   The decision by LaFalce to sponsor the rival plan plainly irked
fellow Democrats who positioned the proposed amendment for floor
action in such a way that it could be offered only by Republican
Leader Bob Michel of Illinois or someone designated by him.
   As debate began, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis.,
blasted the bill sponsors for fashioning a measure that exempts
Congress itself.
   ``The same thing ought to apply in the Congress of the United
States,'' Sensenbrenner said. He urged lawmakers to ``end the
hypocrisy of us insulating ourselves from our own laws, once and
for all this afternoon.''
   Black lawmakers launched the debate by pleading for approval of
the bill.
   ``This is the single most important civil rights legislation
since the 1964 civil rights act,'' said Rep. Al Wheat, D-Mo. He
said it carried ``a simple message that discrimination and
particularly intentional discrimination based on race is not
acceptable in America.''
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., attacked the LaFalce substitute,
declaring, ``There is no substitute for justice.''

   Public phone calls through AT&amp;T were cut off
Thursday between the United States and Kuwait and Iraq, an AT&amp;T
spokesman said.
   Two other telephone companies were still getting some calls
through Thursday evening, according to their spokesmen.
   The AT&amp;T spokesman, Herb Linnen, said some calls got through to
Kuwait as Iraqi troops invaded, but there were long delays because
of the heavy volume of calls _ at one point 2,000 every five
minutes.
   Calls between the United States and Iraq, however, were cut off
from the Iraqi end without any explanation at about 10 a.m. EDT, he
said.
   Efforts to route calls to both countries through Britain were
not very successful because of the heavy number of calls already on
those lines, he said.
   Linnen said the company itself had managed to get only ``six or
seven'' calls through to Kuwait before service was stopped about
6:30 p.m.
   MCI was having trouble completing calls between Kuwait and the
United States because of ``technical difficulties'' but was able to
get calls through to Iraq, spokesman John Houser.
   A US Sprint spokesman, John Landsberg, said the large number of
attempted calls between the United States and Kuwait clogged
circuits and prevented calls from going through. Calls to Iraq were
still possible, he said.
   Japanese telecommunications authorities reported Kuwait-Japan
service interrupted about the same time, but British authorities
said some calls were still getting through, Linnen said.
   AT&amp;T employees include Americans, Canadians, British, Filipinos
and one Sri Lankan who were working on a project with the Kuwaiti
government to improve communications, the spokesman said.

   Congress, responding to a spate of ethics
scandals, is taking its first step toward curtailing lawmakers'
``money chase'' for campaign funds as senators also vote to quit
accepting outside speaking fees.
   The Senate's Democratic majority overrode Republican opposition
Wednesday night to approve the first change in federal election
laws since Congress voted 16 years ago to publicly finance and
limit spending on presidential elections in wake of the Watergate
scandal.
   On a 59-40, largely party-line vote, the Senate approved a
campaign finance bill to place similar limits on congressional
candidates' spending, provide them with subsidies to buy television
advertising and outlaw special-interest political action committees.
   ``We have a system out of control,'' said Sen. David Boren,
D-Okla., the bill's chief author. ``The money chase has not slowed
down.''

   The House easily approved a 1990 farm bill
that limits subsidies but is faulted by the Bush administration for
not achieving enough savings.
   ``I think the basic skeleton of legislation will stay
together,'' Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, said Wednesday night after the House's 327-91 vote. ``The
main problem is going to be numbers, with the budget summit.''
   The administration has threatened a veto if costs in the bill
are not decreased.
   ``The administration wants no program,'' said de la Garza.
``They are trying to use the budget to achieve that end.''

   Smokers carrying a still-unidentified gene are
more likely to develop lung cancer at an early age, according to a
study that traced smoking and lung cancer histories in 337
Louisiana families.
   The study, published in the Journal of the National Cancer
Institute on Wednesday, said there was a clear genetic component to
the early onset of lung cancer among smokers. However, it said the
gene plays a lesser role in cancer among smokers late in life.
   ``If you smoke long enough, it'll get to you eventually,
regardless of what genes you are carrying,'' said Thomas A.
Sellers, a University of Minnesota scientist who was the lead
researcher in the study. ``The genetic component influences the age
of onset of the disease.''
   He said that statistically, about 27 percent of the smoking
population will get lung cancer over a lifetime.

   Mayor Marion Barry occasionally used cocaine,
but that doesn't justify government use of uncorroborated testimony
from legally tainted witnesses in an attempt to bring him down, his
lawyer contends.
   ``I will start right from the beginning by telling you that Mr.
Barry used cocaine,'' R. Kenneth Mundy said Wednesday during
closing arguments in the mayor's drug and perjury trial. ``We do
not intend to give you the impression for one moment that there was
not occasional drug use by Mr. Barry.''
   But the government adopted the philosophy of ``the ends justify
the means'' to catch the mayor using drugs, Mundy argued.
``Everything that the government could amass against him was put
forward.''
   Earlier Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin in her
closing argument called Barry a ``general in the war'' on drugs
``who was working with the other side.''

   Under mounting political pressure to speed the pace of the

Angeles' new rail system to work. OK, not many are doing it, but
officials say it's a start.
   After an 18-day introductory period during which the ride was

Wednesday.
   Ridership plummeted by more half, to about 11,000, but Rapid

   Half-white, half-Indian
Mayfair was never meant to be, but the Indians refused to leave and
the result is an example of what South Africa could become after
apartheid.
   The residential area on the fringe of Johannesburg's downtown
area was designated white, but the government eventually
acknowledged the presence of Indians by declaring part of it open
to them. Indian families later moved into the white area too,
making Mayfair truly multiracial.
   ``You see the emergence of a geniune non-racial outlook,'' said
Cassim Saloojee, an Indian resident and activist who has fought for
integrated neighborhoods.
   ``Mayfair in fact gives one a glimpse of what could happen in
South Africa once apartheid has been done away with,'' Saloojee
said.
   As President F.W. de Klerk moves ahead with plans to dismantle
apartheid, the issue of segregated neighborhoods is among the most
emotional.
   Anti-apartheid groups say living where one chooses is a
fundamental right, but right-wing whites vow never to allow
integration in their neighborhoods.
   The Group Areas Act of 1950, which segregates neighborhoods, is
part of the official apartheid race policy that preserves supremacy
for South Africa's 5 million whites over the 28 million blacks.
   Since last year, the government has opened 10 small
neighborhoods to all races and has promised to amend, but not
repeal, the Group Areas Act next year.
   Blacks, Indians and people of mixed race have lived in many
white urban areas illegally for years, usually because of housing
shortages in zones designated for their own racial groups. The
``whites only'' Hillbrow neighborhood of Johannesburg, for example,
has become overwhelmingly black.
   Change in Mayfair and other integrated areas has been achieved
by the persistence of many ordinary people, like Gladys Govender,
of Indian descent.
   Mrs. Govender, 60, says she has never lived in an area set aside
for Indians, who account for just under 1 million of South Africa's
38 million people.
   She and her family moved to Mayfair in 1979, into a house on
Hanover Street, a slightly seedy area that was the unofficial
dividing line between the white and Indian sections.
   They chose Mayfair, Mrs. Govender said, because they needed a
bigger house and the closest officially Indian area, Lenasia, was
nearly 20 miles outside Johannesburg.
   The Hanover Street house was rented in the name of a white
person in an attempt to get around the law, but within months,
police were calling on the Govenders regularly.
   ``Even at night,'' she said, and told of an evening when the
family had ``just laid laid the table to have supper, then they
rushed in.''
   Authorities charged Mrs. Govender with violating the Group Areas
Act. With the help of an anti-apartheid group called Actstop, she
won a landmark case in 1982 that allowed her to remain in Mayfair.
   In its ruling, the court said the government must provide
alternative accommodations for anyone evicted from an area for
racial reasons. Because of the critical housing shortage for
non-whtes, the decision makes it much more difficult for the
government to evict or prosecute then.
   Soon after Mrs. Govender's victory, the government declared part
of Mayfair an Indian neighborhood and families in overcrowded
Indian areas began buying houses there.
   More Indian families also crossed the line into the white part
of Mayfair. The Johannesburg City Council now estimates Mayfair has
7,000 white residents and about 2,500 Indians, not counting Indians
who live illegally in the white sector.
   Several relatively minor racial incidents have occurred in
Mayfair in recent years, but no serious ones.

<HEAD>Use of Inhalants Increasing in Mexico</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA CASTANEDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mariachi band was playing for tourists in
Garibaldi Plaza when the stink of paint thinner began to overpower
the fragrance of roses sold by strolling vendors.
   A thin, disheveled woman stood in the middle of the square with
a folded piece of cloth in one hand and a plastic bottle of clear
liquid in the other.
   ``This is my only vice,'' said the 23-year-old prostitute, who
gave her name as Gloria and swayed as she held the solvent-soaked
rag to her face. ``This, a little wine and my cigarettes.''
   Narcotics abuse has not reached epidemic proportions in Mexico;
a national drug prevention program and a troubled economy have
helped keep the use of hard drugs from expanding.
   Cheap inhalants like glue, paint thinner and other industrial
solvents are becoming popular among the lower economic classes and
fears are growing that Mexico is fertile ground for drug addiction.
   One reason is the wide variety of illegal drugs available here.
Mexico grows marijuana and opium poppies, and is a transit point
for cocaine and heroin bound for the United States from South
America.
   More than half the 85 million people are under 19 and an
estimated 800,000 enter the glutted job market each year.
   ``They have no opportunity for employment or school,'' said
Mario Alberto, who works at Drug Addicts Anonymous. ``There is a
great number of people at risk.''
   The latest National Survey of Addictions found that 4.3 percent
of Mexicans, more than half of them under age 34, had experimented
with drugs at least once. It was conducted in 1988 and released
this year by the General Directorate of Epidemeology and the
Mexican Psychiatric Institute.
   It said drug use was significantly more prevalent in
northwestern states like Baja California, Sonora and Sinaloa that
are close to the U.S. border or serve as bases for large-scale
traffickers.
   Of the estimated 500,000-plus drug addicts in Mexico, the
federal attorney general's office says, 300,000 use inhalants,
200,000 use marijuana, 30,000 use cocaine and the rest use heroin
or opium.
   People working in prevention and rehabilitation programs worry
about the increased use of inhalants.
   Money determines the drug of choice in a nation whose minimum
wage is equivalent to $3.60 a day.
   ``We are a poor country,'' said Martha Nelda Morales, assistant
director of the Adolescent Orientation Center, a health service
group. ``We are trying to satisfy our basic needs, like food,
clothing and shelter.''
   A half pint of paint thinner costs 7 cents and a tube of glue
$1.07. It is illegal to sell either to anyone under 18, but
enforcement is lax.
   Street prices for marijuana and cocaine, respectively, are about
$1.80 a cigarette and $35 a gram.
   ``They give it away,'' a 14-year-old user named Jose said of
inhalants. He was walking in Garibaldi Plaza, a tourist area of
curio shops, bars and food stands where mariachis play for tips.
   Inhalants can cause permanent damage to the brain, liver, lungs
and stomach, but Jose and other users show little concern about
that.
   ``It takes away my hunger, my sleepiness and my problems,'' Jose
said, gripping a tiny container of paint thinner. ``I'll stop when
I get older.''
   Some people say a ``higher morality'' has kept hard drugs from
getting a strong hold on this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation.
   ``The concept of the family is stronger,'' Ms. Morales said.
   Dr. Raul Zapata Aguilar, medical director for the national Youth
Integration Centers, said a decision to focus on prevention had
made the difference.
   ``Twenty years ago, Mexico decided the only way to stem the tide
of drug use was to stem the demand for drugs,'' he said.
   Most Mexican drug programs do not use the fear themes popular in
the United States, such as ``Drugs Kill.''
   Zapata believes the appeal to fear has only a short-term effect:
``It's like speeding on a highway and seeing an accident,'' he
said. ``You will slow down for the next five miles, but eventually
you will speed up again.''
   The usual Mexican approach is to de-emphasize drugs and teach
adolescents, parents and teachers how to achieve a healthy
emotional, family and physical life.
   Advertisements show young people river rafting, for example,
with the words ``Say yes to life'' across the top in large letters
and ``Say no to drugs'' in smaller print on the bottom.
   Direct-action programs organize activities like weight lifting,
street theater, poetry workshops and sports teams in poorer
neighborhoods to keep children away from narcotics.
   A Roman Catholic priest known as Father Chimchachoma runs
Providence House. He collects kids from the street and takes them
to one of its 15 homes, where they can live until they finish
school or learn a trade.
   One morning, he told three new arrivals of a diamond left in a
muddy field. Passers-by ignored the dirty, seemingly worthless
object, he said, but someone finally picked it up and washed it.
   ``And what did he find?'' the priest asked.
   ``A diamond!'' the boys shouted in unison.
   ``And what are you?''
   ``Diamonds!''

<HEAD>Anthropologist Explores the Cultural Diversity of America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a moment in Alan Lomax's wonderful
``American Patchwork'' series on PBS when you understand the
incredible power of cultural forces and the ingenuity of his
anthropologist's vision.
   Lomax takes us to a joyous New Orleans neighborhood parade at
Carnival time, when black men don gorgeously ornate ``Mardi Gras
Indian'' costumes and take to the streets for ritual dance duels
with rival tribes.
   He shows us their regalia and little-known rituals and then,
almost casually, his video camera tilts down to show their feet,
which slide along to the music in a distinctive, ground-hugging
step.
   They he cuts to a shot of bare feet, dancing the identical step.
The camera pulled back to reveal the dancers of a West African
village street parade.
   It is a thoughtful, clever touch: Immutable as chromosomes, that
gliding, ground-hugging dance step has come here from Africa and
has survived, intact, for hundreds of years in the proud cultural
heritage of black Americans.
   ``African culture arrived here along the non-verbal route,'' he
explains. ``Deprived of language, it kept its body language, its
enormously rich oral and non-verbal traditions.''
   The final episode of his fine, five-part series airs tonight on
PBS. Like the others, it's filled with music, color, stories and
songs from the patchwork quilt of American culture that somehow is
more than the sum of its parts.
   ``The human species for 90,000 years has devoted itself to
communications systems, to music, dance, songs,'' said Lomax, who,
with his father, John A. Lomax, compiled the Library of Congress'
distinguished Archive of American Folk Song.
   ``Now that it's beginning to slip away from us, it begins to
look mighty precious,'' he said.
   The series' second episode explored the musical traditions of
southwest Louisiana's vital Cajun culture, from the rowdy,
horseback gathering of the community's Mardi Gras gumbo to its
pastoralist origins in western France.
   The third episode, ``The Land Where Blues Began,'' was a moving
look at the music of the Mississippi Delta, what Lomax calls ``the
powerful bitter poetry of an oppressed people.''
   Lomax interviews the mule skinners who hauled the earth to build
the Mississippi River levees. To hear the work songs and
``hollers'' they sing is to see the human face of a fundamentally
American music. It's powerful stuff.
   ``Appalachian Journey'' followed the Britons who settled the
eastern mountains, where the isolation ``gave their heritage time
to reorganize itself,'' and led to the creation of bluegrass music,
``our first genuine folk orchestra.''
   The final episode, ``Dreams and Songs of the Noble Old,''
features elderly balladeers and musicians who pass their music to
the young.
   ``It's not preservation, it's process,'' Lomax said. ``It's
keeping things going.''
   Lomax, a research associate in anthropology for Columbia
University and Hunter College, believes that our centralized
electronic communications system is imposing ``standardized,
mass-produced and cheapened cultures everywhere.''
   Human beings and human affairs, he says, are 90 percent
cultural. Our cultures give us ways of thinking, feeling,
communicating and adapting to our environment that are unique to
human beings.
   ``If those absolutely important things are ignored, of how we
speciated, how we adapted to the planet, then we're going to lose
something precious,'' he said. ``There won't be anywhere to go and
no place to come home to.''
   ``American Patchwork'' is a joint production of the University
of North Carolina Center for Public Television, the National
Endowment for the Arts's Media Program, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting and PBS.
   Although the series wraps up Friday night, check your local
listings carefully. North Carolina public TV spokeswoman Chancy
Kapp said the success of the show was such that local rebroadcasts
and even a PBS repeat may be in the cards.

   ANOTHER SPIKE LEE JOINT: Filmmaker Spike Lee and actor Kadeem
Hardison will be hosts of an unusual tribute to jazz late tonight
(actually, very EARLY Saturday) on a special edition of NBC's
``Friday Night Videos.''
   Lee selected most of the videos, including three from his newest
feature film, ``Mo' Better Blues.'' The artists to be featured
include Duke Ellington, Harry Connick Jr., B.B. King and Miles
Davis.
   ``There's a role for all types of music,'' Lee said. ``Artists
like Bobby Brown are OK and rap is OK, but young people need to
know who Duke Ellington is. ... If you like something you hear on
the show, go out to the record store and buy it. Support jazz.''
   The show also will feature the broadcast premier of a new Public

hit, ``Do the Right Thing.''

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lindiwe Phillip, an
anti-apartheid activist, fled into exile and expected to return
triumphantly in a few months. That was 14 years ago.
   She came home in June, when the government granted temporary
amnesty to dozens of African National Congress leaders so they
could return and prepare for talks on ending apartheid, the racial
policy that gives 5 million whites supremacy over the nation's 28
million blacks.
   Ms. Phillip, now 32, was among thousands of young blacks who
left after the the 1976 student uprisings. Hundreds of people were
killed in 1976 and the uprising helped shape a generation of
militant activists.
   ``I thought (exile) would be very temporary, about three
months,'' she said. ``As time went on, I had to grapple with the
fact that I am in exile and that I can no longer go home.''
   The ANC, South Africa's leading black opposition movement, has
an estimated 20,000 members in exile and their return is one of the
main obstacles to negotiations on power-sharing between blacks and
whites.
   While Ms. Phillip was in exile in Zambia, her parents died.
After she was in touch with her brother about the deaths, he was
killed, and then her younger brother was found stabbed to death.
She still does not know who killed either of them.
   ``I was just heartbroken,'' she said. ``I was almost on the
verge of going nuts, crazy.''
   During her exile, Ms. Phillip received military training and
studied in Cuba and Tanzania. She also worked in the ANC Women's
Section and the Department of Information and Publicity in Lusaka,
Zambia, the ANC's exile headquarters.
   Her feelings were mixed when she returned in June with a group
sent to recruit members for the ANC Women's League.
   ``We had so longed to be back home, but at the same time we were
not sure it was the correct time,'' she said.
   African National Congress members began trickling out of South
Africa when the organization was banned in 1960.
   President F.W. de Klerk lifted the 30-year ban in February, but
the ANC has been hesitant to arrange a mass return of exiles
without a guarantee of immunity from prosecution.
   A law passed in February empowers de Klerk to grant immunity,
but so far he has given only temporary amnesty to a few dozen ANC
leaders and officials.
   ANC and government delegations met for the first time in May and
have been working on a document that would allow all exiles to
return.
   Mathews Phosa, a lawyer who is in the ANC delegation, fled South
Africa five years ago when he was told his life was in danger, but
had to leave his wife and 3-year-old daughter behind.
   ``It is one of the most traumatic decisions one could take in
one's life, a very, very painful experience _ shattering,
terrible,'' he said.
   What sustained exiles, Phosa said, was unshakeable belief in the
struggle to end apartheid.
   ``You don't know where you are going to exactly,'' he said.
``You are being uprooted from your loved ones. ... You know you are
going to comrades, but that's not enough. You still have to make
new friends.''
   After the initial shock, life in exile becomes normal, the
lawyer said: ``People get married, they fall in love, they work,
and home is not something that haunts you every day.''
   Finding a place to live is a major problem for returning exiles.
There is a severe shortage of housing for blacks.
   Many will want to catch up on education they missed while
fighting for Spear of the Nation, the ANC military wing, but black
schools are overcrowded, qualified teachers are rare and violence
has disrupted classes for years.
   Recent right-wing violence against blacks and against whites
opposed to apartheid is a source of fear for returning exiles,
Phosa said, ``but that can't be a reason for us not to come home.''
   With ``the political space being there to organize and build our
organization, it would be irresponsible for us not to deploy our
cadres inside the country,'' he said.
   ``I think I am optimistic that we will get over the stumbling
blocks. There is a willingness on the part of the government. They
are very slow ... hesitant, but I think they are moving forward and
they should be credited for that.''

<HEAD>Economic Crisis Raises Concerns About Democracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAROLD OLMOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In one day, the defense minister was
replaced and 143 officers retired. It was peaceful, unlike many
military changes in Latin America, but some Venezuelans wonder how
long that will contine.
   Similar promotions and retirements have occurred often in
Venezuela's 32 years as one of the stablest democracies of Latin
America, with no problems or thought of a coup.
   Fears of the military taking a hand arise now because of an
economic crisis that never seems to ease, a sharp increase in crime
and reports of corruption scandals involving billions of dollars.
   A dozen prominent members of the governing Democratic Action
party were cleared of corruption charges by the party's executive
committee, which caused a storm of protest from opposition and
independent politicians.
   On July 11 a public court issued arrest warrants on corruption
charges for 12 other Democratic Action leaders, including former
Interior Minister Jose Angel Ciliberto. All went into hiding before
police arrived and most are believed to have left the country.
   Jose Vicente Rangel, a political analyst and former congressman,
said on a television program that a coup was possible even after
such a long period of democracy.
   He quoted surveys conducted by ``organizations of the utmost
reliability'' as indicating 20 percent of Venezuelans openly
favored a military takeover and another 20 percent were indifferent.
   ``Venezuelans always supported democracy, but now democracy is
being associated with evils committed by political parties and
politicians,'' he told an Associated Press reporter. ``The surveys
mean four out of 10 Venezuelans are potential supporters of a coup
d'etat.''
   Luis Herrera Campins, a Social Christian who was president in
1978-83, said democracy in Venezuela ``is not 100 percent
guaranteed ... especially if dissatisfaction and social protest
keep growing.''
   Others see coup rumors as a warning, but not a real possibility.
``It could be a way to wish evil on the thing blamed for so many
frustrations: the government,'' said Teodoro Petkoff of the
Socialist Movement party.
   Venezuelan leaders learned early last year that dissatisfaction
can turn to violence. At least 300 people were killed in riots
after President Carlos Andres Perez administered an economic shock
treatment that included raising bus fares 30 percent and ending
food subsidies.
   Perez slowed the program because of the riots, and after 18
months, 72 percent of Venezuelans still spend 70 percent of their
incomes on food.
   Unemployment is slightly more than 10 percent by official
figures, but at least 14 percent according to labor unions. When
the underemployed are added, the rate is well above 50 percent.
   The bloated bureacracy has not been affected, however. It
provides jobs for 1.2 million Venezuelans, or 20 percent of the
nation's labor force.
   ``At least 30 percent of our population suffers from
malnutrition,'' said Jose Curiel, a member of Congress from the
opposition Social Christians. ``Our hospitals simply don't work.
Water is scarce. Public services are collapsing.'' In its attempt
at economic reform, the government said most of the 400-odd public
companies would be sold quickly to private investors. Those
companies are blamed for most of the nation's $35 billion foreign
debt and chronic deficits estimated at up to $2 billion annually.
   No significant company has yet been sold, partly due to fears of
massive layoffs and labor unrest.
   State-owned companies provide jobs for members of political
parties, mainly Democratic Action and the Social Christians, and
are a major base of union power. The Venezuelan Labor Confederation
recently warned the government against layoffs at the main steel
plant, which has 18,000 employees.
   Technical studies say at least 3,000 should be dismissed if the
plant is to stop losing money. Unions describe the studies as
``socially and politically destabilizing.''
   Many Venezuelans see increasing crime as an outgrowth of
unemployment.
   In two recent cases, thieves killed the son of a former
government minister and gunmen took over the home of the Argentine
ambassador.
   Tony Bianchi, editor of The Daily Journal in Caracas. said 25 of
the newspaper's 80 staff members had been attacked in recent months.
   They included Jules Waldman, the founder and chairman, who died
of injuries inflicted by thieves who invaded his home in June.
Waldman, 77, was a New Yorker who spent more than 40 years in
Venezuela.
   Robberies and killings have become so frequent, Rangel said,
that ``Venezuelan society is defenseless. Nobody is safe, not even
at home, and streets are a trap for all.''

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every Malay who is anybody has a
title, from the duli yang maha mulia seri paduka baginda yang
di-pertuan agong _ that's the king _ to each haji and hajah who
makes the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca.
   Tun, tan seri and datuk are among the many hereditary or
conferred titles borne by leading citizens.
   Proper ways of addressing a Malay are diverse and complicated.
Family names are relatively unimportant as long as the title is
used correctly. Improper usage may cause offense.
   Some titles are gained at birth, others given as rewards for
service to government or nation. To the ordinary encik (mister),
titles and forms of address can be confusing.
   The king's title means, approximately, ``his most glorious
majesty who is raised most high.'' In English, ``your majesty'' is
usually enough. The queen, or seri baginda raja permaisuri agong,
also is ``your majesty.''
   Malaysia is unique in having a monarchy that rotates among royal
families. Nine of the 13 states have royal families, whose leaders
take turns being king of the entire nation for five years.
   Passing the throne around solved a sticky protocol problem when
Malaysia shed colonial ties with Britain in 1957. None of the nine
state rulers would have been accepted by the other eight as
permanent king and Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was prime minister,
divised the method of sharing glory.
   Children of the state rulers usually are called tunku or tengku,
loosely equivalent to prince or princess. Tunku Rahman, for
example, is of royal descent.
   Niks and megats are those with royal blood on the mother's side.
Syeds and their female counterparts, sharifahs, claim to be
directly descended from the prophet Mohammed, from royal families
of the Malay archipelago, or both.
   A man honored for distinguished service to the nation becomes a
tun and his wife a toh puan. The title is Malaysia's highest order
of chivalry, limited to 25 living men.
   When Prime Minister Dato Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamad retires,
officials say, he probably will become Tun Mahathir. He is a
medical doctor and was made a dato seri years ago for his
contributions to public life.
   The non-hereditary title tan seri is given to the recipient of
either of Malaysia's two second-highest orders of chivalry for
non-royals.
   Datuks, and the variants datuk seri and dato, are numerous and
their wives are datins. The title is non-hereditary and its basic
meaning is grandfather.
   In higher social circles, practically everybody is a datuk,
whether Malay, Chinese or Indian.
   A common compliment is to call a man dato before he has been so
designated. Few object, except the very modest.
   The highlight of the king's official birthday, celebrated on the
first Wednesday of June, is the conferment of hundreds of awards
and titles. Hundreds more are issued each year by the 13 states,
with datuk in the majority.
   Tuan means sir in Malay, and is used informally to address an
elderly person or someone of prominence or wealth. Tuan yang
terutama, the Malay translation of excellency, is applied to heads
of diplomatic missions and the governors of the four states without
royal families.
   Puan, or madame, often is used to refer to married women. A
single women is called cik.
   Haji and hajah are the titles for men and women who have made a
pilgrimage, or haj, to Mecca and performed certain acts required on
a pilgrimage.
   In Malay usage, bin means ``son of'' and binte means ``daughter
of.'' The part of the name before it is the given name, and the
part after is the name of the person's father.
   Names can be as confusing as titles. The prime minister is
Mahathir Mohamad, the information minister is Mohamed Rahmat and
thousands of others spell the name Mohamat, Muhamat, Muhhammad and
even Mohd.
   In 1988, the goverment decreed the official version of the
prophet's name to be Muhammad. Those already born and named with
other spellings were excused from compliance.

   In the world of advertising, Dentsu is king. In
Japan, it's also a kingmaker.
   Dentsu, which grew out of Japan's wartime propaganda machine,
controls most government public relations and the largest chunk of
all domestic advertising.
   But critics charge Dentsu also controls people's minds, an
accusation that isn't exactly refuted by the company's own
corporate credo: ``Manipulate those around you. In the end, the
manipulative rise way above the manipulated.''
   ``I can't think of any other institution in the world that has
the kind of molding power in society that Dentsu does,'' said Karel
van Wolferen, author of ``The Enigma of Japanese Power.''
   The way in which the firm uses its power underscores the role of
big coporations in general in postwar Japan.
   ``Large Japanese corporations ... have a certain interest in
social control. There's a strong sense of responsibility to
maintain the social order,'' said Wolferen, a Dutch journalist who
has lived in Japan for 25 years.
   One recent example of Dentsu's powers came last year when the
nation was preparing for its first sales tax. Although the loudest
protests against the levy came from housewives, Dentsu Eye, a
Dentsu subsidiary that focuses on the woman's point of view,
promoted the tax.
   ``This was because a group of Dentsu Eye executives came to a
personal decision that the consumption tax was necessary,'' said
Naoe Wakita, Dentsu Eye president.
   Her company designed a newspaper campaign that featured Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto _ because he is considered handsome _
soliciting women's opinions on the tax.
   The once vigorous movement to revise the tax has all but died.
   Dentsu, with an army of 6,000 employees and earnings last year
of $1.31 billion, bills itself as a total communications company
involved in market research, product testing, sales promotion,
public relations, mega-event planning and media brokering.
   What the company's slick brochures don't say is that Dentsu
dominates the mass media in Japan through its interlocking web of
subsidiaries and contractors which, among other things, produce
television programs and the ratings for those programs.
   ``To an American, that sounds like having your hand in the
cookie jar, but it's common for large Japanese companies to be
affiliated with many other companies,'' said Caroline Yamashita, an
American who worked at Dentsu's Tokyo headquarters for two years.
   Dentsu spokesman Ken Kusuhara said, ``Dentsu grew up in the
postwar period with today's large corporations so it's natural that
there's a close connection between us. We're like children who grew
up together.''
   Dentsu's influence with the media is striking. Texas oilman T.
Boone Pickens recently tried to place ads in major Japanese
newspapers accusing Toyota Motor Corp. and other automakers of
forcing high prices on consumers through collusive business
practices.
   Pickens claimed that Dentsu, on client Toyota's behalf, used its
clout with the media to block the ads. His lawyer, Kanji Ishizumi,
said Dentsu told one of the newspapers that members of the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association were ``very concerned'' about
the ad appearing in newspapers.
   The ads, as originally submitted by Pickens, named Toyota,
Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. as the collusive
culprits. But when they were published a week after Pickens went
public with his charges, the carmakers' names were missing.
   Dentsu executive director Teruyoshi Kastsurada dismisses
Pickens' charges. ``Dentsu does not have that kind of power. And
Japanese newspapers are not so weak in their editorial positions
that they would accept whatever Dentsu tells them to do,'' he said.
   But Japanese magazines have also accused Dentsu of strictly
controlling news reports of milk contaminated by a major client and
reports of deaths linked to a cold medicine made by a client.
   A Dentsu executive boasted in a 1971 speech that Japan's largest
newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun, after having invited consumer
advocate Ralph Nader to Japan, heeded a warning from Dentsu by
toning down coverage of the visit. That executive, Shohei Kogure,
is now Dentsu's president.
   Dentsu handles close to 25 percent of all advertising budgets in
Japan, placing more than 20 percent of ads in major newspapers, and
major chunks of advertising in magazines and on prime time
television.
   Dentsu's influence also extends to TV and the big screen. The
company and its affiliates produce a number of high-profile TV
programs and movies. It often uses the stars to offer clients
advertising tie-ins, merchandise sales and other promotional
opportunities.
   Then there's Dentsu's role as a media broker. It buys blocks of
media time and sells it to advertisers, thereby deciding who can
sponsor a TV program and when.
   For public relations work, Dentsu has been the top choice of the
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party since Japan's first general
election after the U.S. occupation.
   Part of the company's power stems from its onetime merger with
the monopolistic Domei news service, which churned out government
propaganda between 1936 and 1945. Of Japan's two major news
agencies today, Kyodo News Service owns 28.3 percent of Dentsu
stock and Jiji Press owns 20.1 percent.
   With 90 percent of its business in Japan, Dentsu's one weakness
is a lack of international experience, observers say.
   But the company has expansion plans. Since 1987, it has operated
in 19 countries as HDM in partnership with U.S. advertising giant
Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. and France's Eurocom. It also formed a joint
venture in 1988 with the American public relations firm
Burson-Marsteller.
   Dentsu executives say they want to expand into countries where
their clients, mostly Japanese companies that have gone
multinational, are doing business.

<HEAD>Visitors Find Americans Friendly, Cities Bustling, but Softball
Boring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The electrical worker from Czechoslovakia says
he must have met a hundred Americans in his 2{ months in America _
but everyone was too busy to become real friends.
   Whenever he talked to the owner of the Virginia publishing
company where he interned, ``I was seeing that the time was running
in his head.''
   The young lawyer from Poland bemoaned Americans' lack of
knowledge about Europe _ or even about America.
   In an after-hours competition with his fellow summer clerks at a
prestigious Washington law firm, he was able to name 45 states of
the union. The best any of his new Harvard-educated friends could
do was 36 or 37.
   These young East Europeans _ a translator, a civil engineer, a
law professor, a legal advisor to the Hungarian parliament, a
Polish radio and television worker and others, many of them with a
history of dissidence _ had been in America since mid-May, learning
the ropes of capitalism and democracy.
   They worked in banks, in bookstores, in congressional offices
and state government, chiefly in Washington and North Carolina,
side-by-side with American counterparts in a program run by the
non-profit National Forum Foundation. Recently, they spent the
morning discussing what they liked, what they disliked and what
surprised them.
   Piotr Kochanski, 28, a lawyer, was the Pole who outshined the
other summer clerks at Hogan &amp; Hartson by listing 45 states ``and
all the presidents of the U.S. in the 20th Century.'' He played
softball with the firm's young lawyers, but found it ``a boring
game.''
   What dismayed him was how little Americans in turn knew about
Europe. ``They know nothing about our country, our history, our
culture,'' he said.
   ``I was asked very funny questions many times,'' agreed Mirek
Kleber, a novice Polish businessman who speaks Russian, French and
German and interned with a bank in Lumberton, N.C. ``Do we have
television in Poland? Do we have cars?''
   On the other hand, Kochanski marveled, ``Americans can organize
something in an hour. Everybody has confidence in the others.
Everybody can trust one another. I love it _ this ability for
working together.''
   And he was struck by how Americans can tear down a perfectly
fine building ``and in two months a new beautiful building can go
up.''
   ``We have all this history in Poland,'' he said. ``I love this
history _ but I think we can learn from your creativity, your
pragmatism, this modern mentality.''
   ``I am from a city one thousand years old,'' said Beata
Kalczynska-Gasic, a civil engineer from Krakow. In Raleigh, N.C.,
where she worked with the state Department of Transportation, she
was shown a picture of the city. What struck her was that no
building was more than 40 years old.
   ``Americans seem to be running toward the future and don't look
back,'' she said. But, she asked, ``Where is the soul in your
cities?''
   Kalliope Bakirdzi, 31, press secretary for a new political party
in Hungary, the Alliance of Free Democrats, worked in the office of
the lieutenant governor of North Carolina and observed the
Democratic Senate primary campaign.
   She liked the civility of American politics, the acceptance of
compromise.
   ``Whatever you are _ Republican or Democrat _ you know there
will always be Republicans and Democrats and you have to get along
with the other side,'' she said.
   In Hungary, she said, ``We hate each other much more than is
needed for normal political life.''
   She was impressed, too, that American politicians can spend 80
percent of their time talking to, meeting, dealing with the voters.
``Our politicians never cared about the people,'' she said.
   But she was puzzled by the fuss over flag-burning in this
country.
   Recalling a television news report, she said, she was ``a little
shocked how they allowed the Ku Klux Klan to march but they try to
ban burning the flag. If you burn a flag, you don't hurt anybody,
but the Ku Klux Klan can hurt people.''
   Daria Golebiowska, 22, advertising director for a Warsaw fashion
house, interned at Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper. She liked
the way people assumed responsibility without direction.
   ``Everybody's working away,'' she said, describing a newsroom's
chaos. ``Everything seems to be so loose. People are coming in and
out and talking on the telephone. And suddenly a newspaper comes
out!
   ``This responsibility for their own work gives people a feeling
they are really important.''
   Jan Lamper, 35, a Czechoslovak worker at an electrical plant,
translator and former dissident, said he thinks Americans work too
hard, much harder than he expected. His friendships didn't have
time to develop.
   ``People are too busy to get involved deeper,'' he said.
``They're working all the time.''
   Andrzej Slaski, 35, a sanitary engineer from Poland, was struck
by the friendliness of the people of Raleigh.
   ``A lot of people in the street say, `hello,' `good morning,'
`hi,''' he said. In Poland, he said, that would happen only in a
village.
   And he couldn't get over of the purity of the water that emerged
from the modern North Carolina sewerage treatment plant he had
visited _ 99.8 percent pure, cleaner than river water. He kept
saying, ``99.8 percent clean!''
   Gabor Nagy, 29, legal adviser to Hungary's Alliance of Young
Democrats and teacher of sociology, worked in a congressman's
office and told of seeing how easily someone was fired for
incompetence. He wasn't dismayed.
   ``That's good!'' he exclaimed. ``This is a competitive society.
Our society was too egalitarian, socialist.''
   Nagy marvelled at the separation of powers, the disdain of the
legislative branch toward the executive branch of government.
   ``People's attitude toward power is not to obey,'' he said. ``It
is almost a kind of distrust of power. Lawmaking is always a
compromise, negotiations between different factions, finding a
common answer. This is very inspiring.''

<HEAD>Mary Wickes is Rectory Housekeeper for Father Dowling'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Wickes plays a no-nonsense rectory
housekeeper in ABC's ``Father Dowling Mysteries,'' but that's
nothing new.
   Wickes has appeared in nine series, five of them as housekeepers.
   Wickes has kept house on television for Ronald Colman, Ezio
Pinza and Peter Lind Hayes. She was the Irish housekeeper in a
production of ``The Canterville Ghost''; she was the original
English nanny ``Mary Poppins'' in a 1949 special.
   Her ``Father Dowling'' character, Marie, is the kind of role _
crusty, outspoken, yet totally endearing _ that Wickes has honed to
perfection. Tom Bosley stars as the crime-solving priest Father
Dowling, Tracy Nelson is Sister Steve and James Stephens is Father
Prestwick.
   Wickes said she sometimes gets letters from Catholic priests.
``They always say, `Boy, have we got somebody in the rectory like
you,''' she said.
   ``She's no dope. She tells you what she thinks. She and Father
Prestwick don't see eye-to-eye. He's apple-polishing the bishop,
and she keeps him in line,'' Wickes said.
   Occasionally, Marie _ admittedly, a supporting character _ gets
to play a more central role in the detective work, and Wickes
relishes the opportunity.
   ``I hope we can keep it up because it's fun,'' she said.
   Of course, Wickes has played roles with a religious bent before
_ she played nuns in two movies with Rosalind Russell. She was
Sister Clarissa in ``The Trouble With Angels'' and ``Where Angels
Go ... Trouble Follows.''
   But the bread and butter of her career has been maids, with an
occasional sortie as a nurse.
   She was Miss Preen, called ``Miss Bedpan'' by the intimidating
Sheridan Whiteside, played by Monty Woolley, in ``The Man Who Came
to Dinner,'' on Broadway and in the movie, her first. She also
played the role on radio and television with Fred Allen, Edward
Everett Horton and Orson Welles.
   She was a nurse in two series, ``Julia'' and ``Doc.'' And she
was the most decorated nurse in the Korean War in an episode of
``M-A-S-H'' written for her.
   Her career has been a long one, and despite the maid-nun-nurse
typecasting, a varied one.
   She was only 18 when she graduated from Washington University in
St. Louis and joined the Berkshire Playhouse in Massachusetts for
seven seasons. Her father wouldn't allow it until he had
``auditioned'' the director.
   Her stage career has had many stops, including the St. Louis
Municipal Opera, where she's appeared in 14 production; it is the
topic of the master's thesis she is writing at UCLA.
   ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' was just one of five plays by
George S. Kaufman in which she had roles; the dean of comic
playwrights once called her ``my favorite comedienne.''
   Wickes has appeared in 44 movies. The most recent is the
as-yet-unreleased ``Postcards from the Edge,'' the film version of
Carrie Fisher's autobiographical novel which features Meryl Street,
Shirley MacLaine and Richard Dreyfuss.
   And she has been a television mainstay since the earliest days
of the medium, a time she remembers with both fondness and
discomfort.
   The lights were so hot, she says, that ``they used to give us
salt tablets.'' She recently paid $300 for a kinescope of ``Mary
Poppins,'' presented live on ``Studio One,'' and reports that,
``You can hear the cameras and cables moving on the floor.''
   Some of her shows are still well-known _ ``Dennis the Menace''
and ``Julia,'' among them _ but others have been buried by the
sands of time: ``Bonino,'' ``Inside U.S.A. With Chevrolet,'' ``The
Peter Lind Hayes Show,'' ``The Halls of Ivy,'' and ``The Gertrude
Berg Show,'' among them.
   She remembers ``Bonino,'' which lasted 3{ months in 1953:
``Pinza played an Italian opera star, and I was his housekeeper.
What else? Pinza had been in this country 26 years, but they had to
translate the jokes into Italian for him before he could understand
them.''
   She also has been a guest on other shows _ ``Make Room for
Daddy,'' ``Sesame Street'' (she played the Plant Lady), ``Match
Game'' and the various Lucille Ball shows.
   She and Lucy were close friends, and says some of Lucy's
off-camera adventures could be as funny as those on screen.
   ``Once Lucy and I went shopping _ this was for real, not on the
show,'' she said. ``She brought the Marquis Chimps with her. One of
the chimps was a baby in diapers and another was an alcoholic. Lucy
was shopping for sheets, and we had these chimps parading along
with us.''

<HEAD>Darlanne Fluegel Is New Woman Police Partner on NBC's `Hunter'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Darlanne Fluegel was about to accept another
series offer from NBC when she heard a new partner was being sought
for Fred Dryer on ``Hunter.''
   ``It had to happen for me very fast,'' she said. ``If not, I'd
have to accept the other show. I knew this was going to be my role.
I went into the meeting and _ pow _ I got it. Fred was very
supportive. He went with me to the network to audition.''
   Fluegel plays Officer Joanne Molenski, a member of the Los
Angeles Police Department's Metro Squad and Sgt. Rick Hunter's new
partner. She replaces Stepfanie Kramer, who quit her role as Sgt.
Dee Dee McCall after six seasons.
   It's probably a good thing Fluegel got the role. The other show
hasn't yet shown up on the NBC schedule.
   Fluegel, a former model, played Dennis Farina's wife in the NBC
series ``Crime Story,'' and has been in such movies as ``Once Upon
a Time in America,'' ``The Eyes of Laura Mars,'' ``To Live and Die
in L.A.,'' ``Tough Guys'' and ``Freeway.''
   She was cast in ``Hunter'' after returning from Canada and a
guest role on CBS' ``Wiseguy.''
   ``There are so few good, interesting roles for women on
television,'' she said. ``You have to take what's available and
make it interesting. I told myself, `If a role comes along with
screen time, I'm going to take it.' This was it.
   ``I like the feeling at `Hunter.' It's like working with
friends. Too often when you walk on a set, it's every man for
himself.''
   In the upcoming fall season, Hunter has been transferred from
homicide to the Metro Squad, where he's teamed up with Molenski.
   ``Fred and I will work out how our partnership goes,'' she said.
``We didn't want it to be the typical `I don't like you, you don't
like me, all of a sudden we're friends' thing. I think a lot of
relationships depend on the day. They can bounce a lot of ways.
It'll be strictly a professional relationship, because a policeman
has to know that he can depend on his partner.
   ``Being in the Metro Squad will allow us to work on a wide
variety of cases, not just homicides,'' she said.
   Before beginning her role, Fluegel spent time talking to women
police officers and riding with them on patrol.
   ``I've never played a police officer before,'' she said. ``I
went to several different police departments because I wanted to
see how different police forces handled things. I'm usually on the
other side of the law. I was a cop's wife on `Crime Story.' On
`Wiseguy,' I was a madam.''
   Fluegel grew up in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and Binghamton, N.Y.,
where she wanted to be an actress before she even started school.
   ``Once, I almost said I wanted to be an actress, but I knew I'd
be ridiculed,'' she said. ``So I said ballerina. In high school, I
was so shy I never even considered going out for school plays. My
aspiration was to go to London. I graduated high school early so I
could go to New York. London was a little out of my reach. All I
had was fare to New York.''
   Fluegel studied acting in New York, and worked as a model with
the Ford Agency. Her first film role was in ``The Eyes of Laura
Mars,'' in which she played a model.
   ``I got a lot of offers,'' she said, ``but dramatic Darlane was
a Stella Adler student and said no to everything. I was such a
snob. I expected the roles to be better. I wouldn't play roles
where they treated women in a demeaning way. I didn't like the way
they treated women in L.A. _ `Here, baby, I've got a script for
you.'
   ``When I finally did move to Los Angeles, it was after spending
four months in Japan. I wanted to get away from all influences. I'd
just ended a relationship. I gave up acting.''
   That was seven years ago. Now, she lives on a five-acre horse
ranch with her husband, actor Michael Moore, whom she met in an
acting class. They have a 2-year-old daughter, Jenna Carey.
   In addition to her new role in ``Hunter,'' Fluegel will be
before audiences in the not-yet-released movie ``No Cause For
Alarm,'' which also stars Michael Nouri and Charles Durning. It was
made in Yugoslavia.
   ``It's a romantic adventure and I get involved in the action,''
she said. ``I play a pilot.''

   Marie is a 33-year-old school teacher and
the mother of two young boys. She is happily married, lives in a
cozy two-story house, loves children and has had an abortion.
   ``It was a painful choice ... but it was the only choice,'' said
Marie, whose husband supported her decision.
   When Louisiana's legislature voted last month to foreclose that
choice, passing what would have been the nation's toughest abortion
law, Marie and others were forced to examine life before and after
abortion was legalized.
   Many for the first time imagined what they, their daughters and
granddaughters would do if the option no longer existed.
   Their vigils, marches, petitions and letters reached Gov. Buddy
Roemer, and his veto secured abortion rights, at least momentarily
_ Louisiana lawmakers are pondering an override, and abortion
rights supporters are apprehensive.
   ``We've been fighting for our lives,'' Marie said.
   Marie, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on
condition of anonymity, was the victim of protracted childhood
incest. With the birth of each of her sons, long-suppressed
memories crept closer to the surface.
   The fresh-scrubbed redhead became increasingly depressed and
alcoholic. Her home near this small town about 25 miles from New
Orleans became a cage in which she sat, sometimes cradling her
husband's revolver.
   Doctors warned that a third child could trigger irreversible
psychosis.
   ``It wasn't anything either of us wanted to do, but we already
had two children who needed a father and a mother,'' her husband
said. ``She couldn't have come out of another pregnancy without
permanent damage to her psyche.''
   She had the abortion four years ago. Had the bill initially
proposed by Louisiana lawmakers been law at the time, the doctor
who performed Marie's abortion would have faced up to 10 years in
prison and fines of up to $100,000.
   The original bill made no exceptions for rape or incest; Roemer
vetoed it. The second bill excepted pregnancies caused by
aggravated rape and incest reported to police and a physician
within a week; Roemer rejected it, as well. ``Some common-sense,
decent exceptions should be made,'' he said.
   The legislature is considering whether to reconvene for a
first-ever emergency override session Aug. 18. Some lawmakers have
proposed trying to revive the first bill, but the state's
constitution may prohibit the move.
   While they sympathize with the plights of women like Marie,
opponents of abortion in this heavily Roman Catholic and
fundamentalist state are pressing the legislature to override. They
say it's a mistake for women to assume that terminating a
problematic pregnancy will ease their despair.
   ``Abortion is not solving anything,'' said Phyllis Osborne, who
today still regrets the illegal abortion she underwent in 1970.
``We have to get to the heart of the problem of why a woman chooses
abortion: because she feels she has no alternative.''
   Anti-abortion activists offer adoption as an alternative that
protects both the mother and her unborn child.
   ``With abortion, there are two victims: the baby is killed and
the woman is wounded,'' said Linda Jefferson, who cannot bear
children.
   The 37-year-old woman had an hysterectomy more than a decade ago
following complications from the second of two abortions.
   ``I was ignorant, immature and very uneducated about abortion,''
said Jefferson, who founded a pregnancy counseling service
affiliated with the Roman Catholic church two years ago.
``(Abortion providers) tell women it doesn't hurt. But it does hurt
_ emotionally, spiritually and physically.''
   Other women, such as the victims of rape or incest, say the
wounds already inflicted could go no deeper.
   Jacquelyn's 15-year-old daughter was raped last year. The mother
knew members of her interdenominational church in a Baton Rouge
suburb would not approve, but abortion was the only way to keep her
baby from having a baby.
   ``Her virginity was taken from her. I didn't want her life taken
too,'' said Jacquelyn. She herself is a 34-year-old single mother,
who until recently was living on about $130 a month in government
aid.
   Her daughter ``has plans. She's always wanted to be a doctor.
(The pregnancy) would have shattered that dream,'' said Jacquelyn.
   ``If she were being permissive, maybe I wouldn't have considered
abortion. But under the circumstances I felt _ we felt _ it was the
only choice.''
   Jacquelyn said nothing could have stopped her from finding her
daughter help ``somewhere, somehow.'' If abortions had been
outlawed in Louisiana, she might have taken the girl to Mississippi
or Florida.
   That's if she could have scraped money together to make the
trip. Many women who could not afford that option would likely
resort to the illegal and dangerous methods that prevailed prior to
the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which restricted
the right of the states to outlaw abortion.
   A ban on abortions ``would just make them deadly,'' said Dorothy
West, 69.
   She remembers how it was in 1950, the year she nearly bled to
death following an illegal abortion.
   Dorothy was a young mother of two trying to run her deceased
husband's bulldozing business when she discovered she was pregnant
by a man she would later marry. She tried every way she knew how to
induce a miscarriage: quinine, scalding baths, gin and pills
prescribed by back-alley doctors.
   ``I don't believe in baby killing,'' said the Roman Catholic
grandmother. ``I'm not even for capital punishment. But my back was
against the wall and I was frightened. I was thinking about the two
children already living.''
   Three decades later, her 35-year-old daughter Velvet West also
had an abortion. She too cited concerns for the three children she
already had.
   Her father _ Dorothy's third husband _ was an alcoholic, given
to furniture-throwing rages. She felt those same impulses herself,
and she was frightened.
   ``I was afraid I would hurt my own children,'' said Velvet. She
had an abortion, sought counseling and has since remarried and had
another son. ``It was the best parenting decision I ever made. I
was a ticking time bomb.''
   Not all women cite rape or psychological scars as reason for
abortions; abortion opponents says the procedure is too often a
form of birth control, a ``quick fix'' in the words of Linda
Jefferson.
   Michelle, 25, has ended four accidental pregnancies with
abortions: ``Two were out of irresponsibility. Two were failed
birth control,'' she said.
   ``If I hadn't had access, I would have tried to self-abort ...
or suicide,'' she said, blowing cigarette smoke into the rafters of
the New Orleans nightclub where she works. ``I did not want to be a
mother at 17.''
   And such choices, said Norma McCorvey, are what the battle is
all about.
   McCorvey, a native of Louisiana, is known in the legal canon as
Jane Roe _ the woman whose challenge ultimately overturned the
nation's abortion laws, though she herself carried her child to
term and gave her up for adoption.
   McCorvey, 42, traveled from her home in California to Baton
Rouge to join the fight against the Louisiana bill. She feels ``the
hands of time being turned back'' on her Supreme Court victory.
   ``It hurts. It hurts real bad,'' she says.
   ``It's not like anybody is pro-abortion. But a lot of women
really aren't capable of (raising) children,'' she said.
   ``I didn't have a choice.''

<HEAD>Debate Mounting Over Acute Reactions to Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM KRATTENMAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A whiff of perfume or a breeze from the
neighbor's lawn can leave chemically sensitive people speechless.
And they are becoming increasingly vocal about it.
   They complain they're getting sick _ very sick _ from everyday
exposure to common levels of chemicals in the home, office and
environment.
   Chemical sensitivity can leave sufferers vulnerable to
headaches, burning in the throat and lungs, and a paralyzing
disorientation that can render one incapable of speaking.
   Skeptics in the insurance, medical and chemical industries say
they are not convinced the misery isn't all in the sufferers'
heads. The condition has yet to win recognition in those circles,
or the insurance benefits that would result.
   But some scientists insist society is seeing the first
casualties of the proliferation of chemicals. Since World War II,
annual U.S. production of synthetic organic chemicals has exploded
from less than 1 billion pounds to 273 billion by 1988.
   ``These may indeed be the canaries,'' said Claudia Miller, a
University of Texas Health Science Center allergist and
immunologist who co-wrote a study on the malady for the Department
of Health of New Jersey, the state with the nation's second-biggest
chemical industry, behind Texas.
   ``We don't understand the mechanisms,'' she said. ``It may be
neurological or immunological. It may be biochemical.''
   Whatever the mechanism, the effect can be dramatic, say experts
and those who suffer from chemical sensitivity, also known as
environmental illness.
   The illness often begins with a single exposure _ installation
of a new carpet in the office or an accidental release of toxic
materials from a sewage plant _ that seems to traumatize the body
into a permanent, hypersensitive state, sufferers say.
   What follows is a bewildering array of symptoms and a search for
diagnosis and treatment. Patients try to avoid contact with the
pesticides, plastics and building materials they fear will trigger
an episode.
   Some sufferers find breathing relief with use of adrenaline, but
drugs are not too useful because many sufferers react to
pharmaceuticals.
   How many people are affected still is unknown.
   According to the New Jersey report, the National Academy of
Sciences suggested about 15 percent of the population has
heightened sensitivity to chemicals, though fewer people face
intense symptoms. But an academy spokeswoman later said the
estimate was off-the-cuff and should not have been cited by the
authors.
   The medical establishment remains dubious.
   Psychiatrist Carroll Brodsky of the University of California,
San Francisco, who has written extensively on the subject, said it
is more likely a psychological disability.
   ``If you believe you couldn't walk outside or walk anywhere
where there were exhaust fumes, you would be disabled. If that is
the issue, have I seen people like this who are disabled?
Certainly,'' Brodsky said.
   ``Now, whether they have anything wrong with them physically is
quite another matter. ... If physical doctors can't find anything
physically wrong with them, it must be within the realm of the
psyche.''
   Some credible, neutral organizations have given at least some
credence to a physical basis for the disorder.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, in a report to Congress on
indoor air pollution, urges financing for research on chemical
sensitivity. The Congressional Research Service calls chemical
sensitivity one of the consequences of poor indoor air quality.
   And the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has
ruled that people with environmental illness who live in subsidized
housing cannot be forced to have their homes exterminated with
chemicals.
   Some doubters blame malingering employees aiming for workers
compensation benefits. They also point to sufferers' subconscious
fear of workplace pressures and to fright over frequent media
reports about chemicals.
   Clinical ecologists, doctors who specialize in chemical
sensitivity, also have met with skepticism. Mainstream allergists,
for example, have urged the Health Care Financing Administration to
deny reimbursement for clinical ecologists' work.
   But Ms. Miller and her co-author on the New Jersey report
contend the psychological explanation ignores the stunning
similarity of triggering exposures and symptoms reported.
   ``They're all so diverse, yet they're all coming up with the
same thing. Is it all psychological when everyone is coming up with
the same symptoms?'' they ask.
   She and co-author Nicholas Ashford of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology agree that more research is needed.
   Among dozens of proposals to federal and state governments, they
want to set up an ``environmental unit,'' a contaminant-free
chamber in which subjects would be placed and observed as chemicals
were introduced.
   New Jersey officials have not said what recommendations, if any,
they will follow.
   So far, the scientists have found four groups of people most
prone to chemical sensitivity. They are industrial workers,
occupants of well-insulated, poorly ventilated offices, residents
of contaminated communities, and people exposed to chemicals in
household air.
   ``It is widespread in nature and is not limited to what some
observers would describe as malingering workers, hysterical
housewives and workers experiencing mass psychogenic illness,'' the
report says.
   Believers in chemical sensitivity as a physical illness say the
skeptics fear an ominous message: If people are getting sick from
the chemical-laden world, it bodes ill for a huge industry.
   It might mean constructing buildings with better ventilation,
settling for a less-than-perfect lawn or scrubbing toilets with
baking soda.
   And, an industry briefing paper warns, more formal recognition
of chemical sensitivity could bring a torrent of lawsuits and
insurance obligations.
   ``The primary impact on society would be the huge cost
associated with the legitimization of environmental illness,'' says
the paper by the Chemical Manufacturers Association.
   ``It would mean we had a new and very different problem to deal
with,'' said Gordon Strickland, a Chemical Manufacturers
Association vice president. ``(But) we have looked through the data
and looked through the arguments ... and found nothing supportive''
of a physical explanation.
   Mary Lamielle, a chemical sensitivity sufferer from Voorhees,
N.J., and leader of a national group working for official
recognition of the condition, said economics, more than science, is
behind the industry skepticism.
   Lamielle pressured her state senator, Lee Laskin, who in turn
got the Department of Health to do the study. Her group has roughly
2,000 members, mostly sufferers.

   After years of searching, Mary Lamielle
figured out what was making her so miserably, dramatically sick. It
was the world.
   Ms. Lamielle, who lives in Voorhees, is chemically sensitive, a
condition that is not recognized by the medical establishment or
the insurance industry but that sufferers say can be debilitating.
   She founded and leads the National Center for Environmental
Health Strategies, a 2,000-member organization working to win
recognition and help for victims. For herself, she struggles with
an isolation forced by the nausea, vertigo and breathing
difficulties she said will occur if she subjects herself to
perfume, gasoline vapors, even her new car.
   Her crusade began six years ago, with the belief that her
worsening illness had something to do with malfunctions at the
nearby sewage treatment plant, exhaust from idling diesel trucks at
the local chicken processing plant and other things around her.
   ``The property around us was just unbearable,'' Ms. Lamielle
said. ``So my own involvement became a way of self-protection.''

<HEAD>Archaeologists Unearthing More About Vikings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CECILIA LONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIRKA, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The center of the Viking world 1,000 years
ago is under siege by archaeologists who are trying to pry secrets
from beneath the pastures that now cover this farming island.
   Historians believe that Birka, a settlement on an island in Lake
Maleren just west of Stockholm, was home to about 1,000 people. The
site now is covered with grids, in which workers dig by hand
through the seven feet of dirt covering the settlement.
   Two sections have been excavated since the dig began this spring
and although the findings have not been startling, they hint at a
wealth of artifacts to come. The project is to last until 1994.
   Animal bones, remnants of meals, colorful beads, combs and
household utensils that could shed light on Viking home life have
turned up. Archaeologists also found Arab coins, evidence of how
the Vikings roamed.
   The Vikings thrived from the late 8th century to the 11th
century. Their raids struck terror throughout Europe, and their
spirit of adventure drove them far afield, to Iceland and North
America.
   Birka has been recognized since the Middle Ages as the cradle of
Christianity in Sweden. It was here that Ansgar, a missionary from
Bremen and later bishop of Bremen-Hamburg, first preached around
830.
   But while some Viking towns flourished, Birka was deserted at
the end of the first millennium. Where traders once exchanged goods
from all of the known world, sheep graze in meadows and on grassy
mounds containing the graves of Viking traders.
   Historians say Vikings from the Birka region, a people known
then as Rus, sailed eastward across the Baltic Sea and lent their
name to the land of Russia. They reached the Caspian Sea.
   Although Birka was the Vikings' center, it has remained mostly
unexamined while extensive digs were conducted at Viking
settlements in York, England; Dublin, Ireland; Hedeby, West
Germany; Kaupang, Norway; and Staraya Ladoga, Soviet Union.
   The Viking era generally is regarded as having begun in 792, the
year a raiding party attacked the Lindisfarne monastery on
Britain's North Sea Coast. But evidence could be uncovered
indicating that the era began earlier, said Bjorn Ambrosiani of
Stockholm's Museum of National History.
   The only previous excavation of Birka was conducted 100 years
ago by Hjalmar Stolpe, a zoologist who came in search of insect
fossils in 1871 and stayed 24 years to dig up many of the 2,500
Viking age graves.
   Stolpe touched very little of the town of Birka, which stood at
the focus of a heroic chapter in Scandinavian history. Ambrosiani
and other experts are eager to find out how it was built and
developed.
   The project is being financed by one of Sweden's richest men,
industrialist Gad Rausing.
   ``If you go digging you should have proper resources, otherwise
you do more damage than good,'' Ambrosiani said.
   Rausing, who has a doctorate in archaeology, said he pursuaded
the board of directors of his family's Tetra-Pak packaging company
to donate $2.4 million to the project for high-tech assistance _
computers to register the findings daily, and video equipment to
document the objects.

   You may know that raw pork is not safe, or that a bulging can
spells trouble. But how aware are you of the safety of other items
in your kitchen? Take this quiz to find out.
   Is it safe or risky to eat ...
   1. Hot dogs that have been stored in an unopened package in the
refrigerator for 10 days?
   2. A bruised or moldy piece of fruit?
   3. Frozen ham that was thawed on the counter?
   4. An unopened jar of mayonnaise that has been in the
refrigerator for six months?
   5. A baked potato left out on the counter from the night before?
   6. Meat loaf that's pink in the middle after cooking?
   7. Raw ground beef that turns brown after a day or two of
refrigeration?
   8. An uncooked potato with a greenish cast?
   9. Lettuce or other produce moistened by poultry drippings in a
grocery bag?
   10. Steak that was thawed in the refrigerator and then refrozen?
   11. Cooked shrimp that was never deveined?
   12. Mustard or ketchup with a black, crusty ring around the rim
of the jar?
   13. Moldy or shriveled peanuts?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANSWERS
   1. Safe. Hot dogs that come in vacuum-sealed packages can be
kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Once opened, you can
keep them for about seven days, carefully wrapped in plastic.
   2. Safe if it's just bruised. But possibly risky if the bruised
portion has become moldy. Some molds can produce harmful toxins,
and it's not yet clear whether fruit molds are among them. The best
bet is to cut away the moldy section, which should also remove any
toxins that might be pesent.
   3. Risky. Many people think they can take chances with ham
because it has been smoked or salted. But these processes don't
make the meat immune to bacterial contamination, especially since a
number of manufacturers are lowering the salt content of cured
meats. As with any meat, the safest way to thaw ham is in the
refrigerator.
   4. Safe. It's a misconception that foods prepared with
mayonnaise may go bad sooner. In fact, its high acid and salt
content may actually inhibit bacterial growth somewhat. You can
keep an opened jar of mayonnaise in the refrigerator for up to a
year, provided you don't let it sit at room temperature for
extended periods.
   5. Risky. We usually don't think of potatoes as a likely source
of food poisoning, but there have been reports of deadly botulism
in people who ate foil-wrapped baked potatoes left at room
temperature for a day or more, even when they were reheated.
Leftovers of most foods should be promptly refrigerated.
   6. Risky. Ground meat undergoes a great deal of handling,
compared to other forms. This increases the likelihood of bacterial
contamination. For this reason, the USDA suggests cooking meat loaf
until it is brown or at least brownish-pink in the center. An even
better guide is to cook it to an internal temperature of 170
degrees Fahrenheit, cheching with a thermometer, particularly if
the meat loaf contains pork.
   7. Safe. Whether it's brown or pink has to do with the amount of
oxygen with which it has come into contact. As a general rule,
however, don't keep raw ground beef in the refrigerator longer than
two days, and don't use it under any circumstances if it doesn't
smell right or was left unrefrigerated for any length of time.
   8. Risky. Green-skinned potatoes contain a chemical called
solanine, which can cause gastrointestinal illness. You can use
green potatoes if you peel them well and remove a layer of flesh
underneath the skin.
   9. Risky. Uncooked poultry juices may contain harmful bacteria
that could lead to trouble when they get into foods that are eaten
raw. If the produce is really saturated, you'd better not use it.
But if contact was minimal, you can remove outer sections or rinse
and peel.
   10. Safe _ especially if some ice crystals remain. Make sure to
thaw the frozen meat in the refrigerator the second time around. Be
aware, too, that refreezing might cause flavor and texture
deterioration. You might get better flavor and texture if you cook
the meat the first time it is thawed, then refreeze it.
   11. Safe. You can eat shrimp that hasn't been deveined as long
as you cook it. The black line running down the back is actually
the intestines of the shrimp, which are more susceptible to
contamination.
   12. Safe. The ring is the result of an interaction of the
contents with air, not a sign of spoilage. Simply wipe it off and
use the remaining contents.
   13. Risky. When you crack open peanut shells only to find sickly
looking nuts, don't eat them. The types of mold that grow on nuts
(as well as on grains) can produce aflatoxins, some of which are
very potent carcinogens.

<HEAD>Swallowed Bay Leaves Can Require Emergency Treatment, Doctors Warn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swallowing a bay leaf can mean a trip to the
emergency room, warn doctors who suggest that packages of the herb
carry warning labels.
   Only one of five bay leaf victims they studied clearly knew what
had caused the distress in their throats, so the problem is
probably often overlooked, the doctors said.
   Bay leaves, most often dried, are used during cooking to enhance
flavor, but usually are removed before the food is served and are
not eaten.
   The five cases occurred over two years, suggesting the problem
is common, said a report from Evanston Hospital in Illinois in a
recent issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.
   Four patients complained they felt that something was caught in
their throats after eating chowder, chicken soup, chicken or lamb
stew. The fifth had sudden throat pain while drinking onion soup.
   A stuck leaf can be retrieved or pushed into the stomach,
depending on the circumstances, the doctors said. In a case
reported in 1983, general anesthesia was required to fix the
problem, the doctors said.
   ``Prevention could begin with packaging labels that warn of the
hazards of bay leaf ingestion,'' they wrote. ``Cooks could use mesh
bags to contain the leaves, removing the bag of leaves when cooking
was completed.''

<HEAD>Letters Protest Captive Breeding Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 people have written to
the federal government protesting a plan to snare endangered
Florida panthers and put them in zoos for a captive breeding
program.
   Wildlife officials say that may be the only way to save the
panther, an endangered species with only 30 to 50 animals remaining.
   ``Please do not breed them in captivity. What kind of society
are we that we would take our state panther and put them on
display, in zoos, in captivity?'' Greg Ray of Gainesville wrote in
a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Many of the 331 letters were mistaken about various aspects of
the program, in which up to half the remaining panthers would be
captured. Although the cats might be turned over to zoos, they
wouldn't necessarily be on display.
   Fewer than a dozen letters were in favor of the project.
   The program is designed to increase the number of panthers to a
point that a second population could be established in the wild,
probably in northern Florida, officials said.
   Many of the letters contained emotional pleas to save the tawny
cat, Florida's state animal. Eleven letters came from a third-grade
class in Bronson.
   ``How would you like to live in a cage all your life? I would be
sad if someone came and took me out of my home and put me in a
cage,'' wrote student Shawn Voorhees.
   Dennis Jordan, Florida panther coordinator for the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Agency, said only scientific data, not emotion, will save
the Florida panther.
   The public has until Aug. 15 to comment.

<HEAD>Park Officials: Sponge Harvesting Jeopardizing Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BISCAYNE NATIONAL PARK, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hot market for natural
sponges is jeopardizing this offshore park because some harvesters
are hooking the sponges at an alarming rate, park administrators
say.
   ``These sponges, in addition to filtering waters, provide
habitats for the juveniles of various species. When you just clear
an area of them, it's like clear-cutting a forest,'' said Bob
Kelley, a board member of the Tropical Audubon Society. ``There's
nothing left to live in for the small species.''
   The harvesters, who produced reported sales of 16,600 pounds
last year, say an attempt to regulate them could put an end to a
tradition they brought with them from Cuba.
   ``The majority of us have sons, we bring them with us to fish
and they learn,'' said Victorino Sanchez. ``It's a tranquil and
healthy way to make a living.''
   Harvesters now need only a general state license to sponge fish
at the park in Biscayne Bay, south of Miami and the only water in
Dade County clean enough to sustain large sponge beds.
   Park administrators want the regulatory plan to reduce harvests
to 4,000 pounds a year as soon as possible and to gradually phase
out the trade.
   ``What we are proposing is that we have a break in the
generations, that the families living off of it now be permitted to
continue, but they wouldn't be allowed to pass permits on to their
relatives,'' said park Superintendent James Sanders.
   Wholesale prices soared from as low as $4 a dozen to as high as
$45 a dozen, Sanders said. The number of boats went from about four
to 20, and harvesters from a handful to 80 or more in the last two
years.

   In a ruling that could expose the government to
millions of dollars in liability, a federal appeals court said
three asbestos makers can sue for compensation paid to sick workers
at U.S. Navy shipyards.
   Attorneys said the decision would lead to lawsuits by dozens of
companies that are trying to force the government to share in
payments already exceeding $1 billion for asbestos-related diseases
afflicting tens of thousands of workers.
   The ruling Monday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal

Industries Inc. to pursue reimbursement from the government for
payments made to asbestos victims who worked for the Navy as long

<HEAD>Stempel Moves Decidedly into GM Chairmanship</HEAD>

   Robert Stempel took the wheel of General Motors
Corp. and steered the company more toward its factories than to
Wall Street.
   Stempel, who Wednesday officially became the huge corporation's
chairman and chief executive officer, is the first engineer to sit
in GM's corner office in the company's 82-year history.
   He succeeds Roger Smith, who retired after 9{ years as chairman,
a tenure marked by criticism that the accountant concentrated too
much on earnings and not enough on engineering.
   Stempel and the six men he tapped to lead GM into the 1990s met
with reporters Wednesday morning and outlined changes in the
corporation's top management. In essence, Stempel said,
responsibility lines were straightened between the company's eight
car- and truck-making operations and GM's top brass.
   ``These are not major changes, but they're indicative of where
we're going,'' he said. ``We're not taking General Motors apart and
putting it back together again.''
   Stempel's ascension to the chairmanship was widely hailed by
industry observers who said the No. 1 automaker's product
development programs had been unnecessarily put on a back burner as
the company concentrated on boosting profits.
   While Smith was chairman, GM's balance sheet moved from a $333.4
million profit in 1981 to a $4.2 billion profit last year. But the
company's share of the U.S. car and truck market dropped from 46
percent to 35 percent during that same time.
   Stempel said the company planned to boost its market share, but
only if it can do it profitably.
   ``The '90s will be a time of adapting and building what we have
in place,'' Stempel said. GM shuts down its Lakewood assembly plant
in Atlanta on Monday, putting about 2,000 employees out of work.
The company says no further plant closings are in the works, other
than those already announced.
   Lloyd Reuss, who became the company's new president Wednesday,
said he expects 100 percent of GM's assembly plants to be operating
by 1992. He declined to say what percentage of GM's plant capacity
is being used now.
   Since 1987, when the company signed its last contract with the
United Auto Workers union, GM has shut down four assembly plants,
including the Lakewood factory, and plans to close part of its huge
Lordstown, Ohio, complex when it consolidates full-size van
production in Flint by 1992.
   GM has said the four plants are ``indefinitely idled'' with no
new products scheduled for them. Reuss said those plants were not
included in his forecast of 100 percent plant utilization in two
years, and those factories would remain closed.
   The UAW has contended that GM has no intention of putting any
new manufacturing in the plants, and Reuss' comments Wednesday
seems to support that.
   Like Stempel, Reuss and Vice Chairman Robert J. Schultz came up
through GM's engineering ranks. Members of Stempel's team with
financial backgrounds are Vice Chairman John F. Smith Jr.,
Executive Vice President William Hoglund and Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer Robert T. O'Connell.
   Stempel's move to chairman comes at a time when GM's financial
matters appear to be in good shape. Some Wall Street analysts have
suggested that investors switch from Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. stock to GM because GM is the only one of the Big Three that
could boost dividends in the near future.
   Last week, GM reported it earned $1.6 billion the first half of
this year, 46.5 percent less than in the first six months of 1989.
However, GM's profits were higher than the $1.4 billion reported by
Ford and the $251 million reported by struggling Chrysler.
   Stempel, 57, joined the company in 1958 as a senior detailer in
the Oldsmobile Division's chassis design department. In succeeding
years, he concentrated on powertrain design.
   In 1972, Stempel was named assistant chief engineer at
Oldsmobile. Six years later, he joined the legion of nearly four
dozen vice presidents and became general manager of the Pontiac
Division.
   Stempel went to Europe in 1980 to head the company's profitable
Adam Opel AG carmaking operations in West Germany. Two years later,
he returned to the United States to head GM's Chevrolet Division,
the company's largest carmaking operation.
   In February 1986 he joined the GM board as executive vice
president for the Truck &amp; Bus and Overseas groups, before becoming
its 17th president.
   On Wednesday, his first day as GM's 11th chairman, Stempel said:
``I felt terrific getting up this morning.''

<HEAD>The Energy Problem Drifts Into The Background</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also moved in advance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have had their fill of crises, real or
imagined, and can hardly tolerate another. It probably explains why
the energy problem has fallen into the background.
   But there is uncomfortable news in the background, and it might
be summarized in three sentences: American production of crude oil
is falling. Consumption is rising. Imports account for half of U.S.
supplies.
   These ingredients mean an inevitable crisis, the only unknown
being its timing and extent. The timing could be sometime in the
next century; it also could be as imminent as the next time warfare
threatens in the Middle East.
   The U.S. economy runs on energy. That is, the nation's
factories, homes and means of transportation depend on it. As
history has demonstrated, a shortage can stall an automobile or an
economy with equal effectiveness.
   Recognizing this, America went on an energy-saving crusade
beginning in the 1970s. Old homes and factories were insulated and
standards for new ones were raised. Alternative energy supplies
were encouraged and businesses for that purpose were founded.
   Much of that seems like a memory now, akin to the lingering
thoughts some people have of blackouts and ration cards during
World War II. That deprivation ended suddenly; people resumed their
lives and said ``never again.''
   But the energy war never was won. Its ingredients remain and
they're just as explosive as ever: a country totally dependent on a
stable supply but with no assurance of it; a country increasing
energy usage but not its production.
   Domestic crude oil production in June fell to 7.1 million
barrels a day, the lowest on record. That month's output was 7.7
percent below a year earlier and no less than 2 million barrels a
day below the rate in February 1986.
   Drilling crews have disbanded, and while exploration continues
it is at a reduced rate. Increasingly, the demand for oil runs
headlong into the demands of environmentalists to protect the
planet's water, wildlife and beauty.
   The alternative is to import. Oil imports now are at a record
high, slightly exceeding the record of December 1977, when 47.9
percent of the nation's supply came from abroad. While domestic
output runs into environmental restrictions, imported oil runs in
opposition to balance of payment efforts.
   No matter how it is viewed, therefore, energy in the form of
crude and refined oil is a problem of deadly proportions, potential
or actual. And it can erupt as easily as, for example, hostilities
in the Mideast.
   In spite of this vulnerability _ of just about every individual,
business and governmental unit _ you don't hear much talk these
days about energy supplies except perhaps to hear about another
nuclear power facility unbuilt.
   All the creative ideas of a decade ago are warehoused like old
inventory. Many of the briefly successful alternative energy
companies have collapsed. The old conservation methods seem like
holdovers from another time.
   Except for another oil spill, energy doesn't make big news these
days. It has receded into the background, overwhelmed by what are
considered to be more urgent problems.
   But the ingredients of crisis still are there. Everyone knows
it, and they know too that experience teaches that knowing is not
enough.

<HEAD>Court Backs Asbestos Makers Right To Sue Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government has been ordered to prove in
court why it shouldn't have to compensate tens of thousands of
workers made sick inhaling asbestos fibers in U.S. Navy shipyards.
   Attorneys said the 2-1 ruling by the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington could subject the
government to millions of dollars in liability for asbestos-related
exposure dating to the 1930s.
   ``The government specified products with asbestos in it, the
government controlled working conditions and the government in the
view of many people has the primary responsibility for what
happened,'' Andrew Berry, a Newark, N.J., attorney for several
asbestos makers, said Wednesday.
   Companies that made asbestos are trying to force the government
to reimburse them for at least a portion of liability payments
already exceeding $1 billion. The government to date has not
admitted responsibility or agreed to pay compensation.
   The court ruling allows Eagle-Picher Inc., Keene Corp. and UNR
Industries Inc. to pursue reimbursement from the government for
payments made to asbestos victims who worked for the Navy.
   ``So far only our clients have paid the tab,'' said Joe G.
Hollingsworth, a Washington attorney representing UNR and
Eagle-Picher. ``The government has escaped liability by virtue of
technical arguments. We'd like to prove what (its) real
responsibility was.''
   David S. Fishback, a Justice Department lawyer handling the
case, declined to comment.
   More than 100,000 asbestos cases involving workers afflicted
with lung cancer and other severe and often fatal diseases are
clogging federal and state court dockets nationwide.
   The bulk of the payouts has been made by a trust created in
Manville Corp. bankruptcy proceedings. The trust has run out of
money and is being restructured to speed payments to needy victims.
Other companies also have been pushed into bankruptcy by asbestos
lawsuits and want to reduce their liability.
   Widespread illnesses from inhaling fibers of asbestos _ a
mineral used widely for its heat resistance and fire retardant
qualities _ did not appear until the 1970s, in some cases after
decades of exposure.
   Manufacturers have argued the government should be held liable
because it allegedly failed to tell them about asbestos' health
hazards and because the government was contractually responsibile
for maintaining a safe workplace.
   But in numerous decisions in the last 10 years, courts have
shielded the government from liability on the grounds that it has
immunity against lawsuits filed by federal employees. Other
procedural arguments have helped keep cases from proceeding to
trial.
   Berry said the latest ruling ``places pressure on the government
to assist in resolving the cases.''
   The decision orders the U.S. Claims Court to hear anew the three
companies' claims. It would be the first time that the merits of
whether the government is liable _ rather than jurisdictional
issues _ are argued in court.
   The U.S. Claims Court in Washington handles all claims against
the federal government.
   The companies had been blocked from pursuing lawsuits against
the government simultaneously in claims court and federal district
court. But the appellate ruling said the claims court case
involving the government's contractual obligations with the
companies should be heard again because it had been dismissed by
other courts.
   A group of defendants in more than 500 asbestos lawsuits in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn on Tuesday filed a motion seeking to add
the government to the list of defendants in the consolidated case.
   The government has been held liable in only one case and was
required to pay one-third of an asbestos settlement of about
$50,000 to a Maine woman who contracted a lung disease from
cleaning her father's asbestos-tainted clothes.
   The government's claim of immunity did not apply in the 1st U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals case because the woman was not a federal
employee.
   Hollingsworth, who represented the Maine woman, Joan Dube, said
the government has not paid its portion of the settlement in that
case or agreed to hold settlement negotiations in a similar case.

<TEXT>
   Karsten Mahlmann, who resigned as chairman of the
Chicago Board of Trade and head of Stotler Group Inc., said he
hasn't been involved in day-to-day affairs at the struggling
brokerage for two years.
   Mahlmann, who was in an unprecedented fourth term as the CBOT's
chief, said he was stepping down Wednesday ``in the overwhelming
interest of the Board of Trade and because of my deep love and
respect for the institution,'' according to a statement from the
exchange's board of directors.
   The board said it regretfully accepted the resignation,
effective immediately. The board also said it had elected CBOT Vice
Chairman William F. O'Connor to serve the remainder of Mahlmann's
one-year term, ending Dec. 31.
   Hours earlier he resigned from Stotler Group Inc., whose main
subsidairy has fallen from one of the biggest players on the CBOT
to the target of a Commodities Futures Trading Commission civil
complaint. The subsidiary, Stotler and Co. has withdrawn from the
futures business because of shaky finances.
   ``I have had no day-to-day management responsibilities (at
Stotler) since early 1988, and my position at Stotler was
constantly eroded,'' Mahlmann said Wednesday.
   ``I simply was not a party to the financial decisions (at
Stotler) which are now being scrutinized by the exchange and the
regulators,'' he added.
   Mahlmann said had he been aware of Stotler's recent financial
decisions, ``I would not have condoned them, and I would have taken
action to reverse them.''
   He said he remains Stotler Group's largest shareholder.
   On Tuesday federal regulators filed a civil complaint in U.S.
District Court accusing a Stotler subsidiary, Stotler Funds Inc.,
of violating the Commodity Exchange Act.
   The complaint filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
says the commodity pool operator improperly used pools of clients'
money which had been set up for investing in commodity futures
contracts.
   Some CBOT members believe Stotler's woes damaged Mahlmann's
ability to lead the CBOT's battle over regulation of the futures
industry and had called for him to resign, said John Frazier,
director of the agricultural division at Chicago-based Gerald Inc.,
an exchange member.
   The exchange wants the CFTC to maintain control over stock-index
futures, but the Bush administration wants to transfer that
authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees
the stock market.
   Several ranking industry officials, though, said they didn't see
Mahlmann's departure as having much effect on that fight.
   Meanwhile, both the CFTC and the SEC have been called to account
for their handling of the Stotler situation.
   The House Committee on Energy and Commerce has ordered the
chairmen of both commissions to submit reports on Stotler by Aug.
24.
   ``These events raise serious questions about the adequacy of
regulation and oversight in the futures industry,'' said a letter
Tuesday from committee chairman Rep. John D. Dingle, D-Mich., and
Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the Subcommittee on
Telecommunications and Finance.
   ``Press reports suggest that Stotler was thinly capitalized as
early as 1987 but that the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
and the Chicago Board of Trade took no action,'' the letter added.

   Karsten Mahlmann's resignation as chairman of the
Chicago Board of Trade is only the latest woe to befall the
commodities industry in recent years.
   Since the 1987 stock market crash, questions have been raised on
whether the Commodities Futures Trading Commission is adequately
regulating the industry and on the honesty of traders on the Board
of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Also given a serious
look was the way the Board of Trade handled an alleged attempt to
corner the soybean market by Ferruzi Trading International SpA.
   Mahlmann resigned Wednesday as chairman of the CBOT, the world's
largest commodity futures exchange, amid allegations of wrongdoing
at a trading company he headed. He was midway through an
unprecedented fourth term as the CBOT's chief.
   Mahlmann's resignation came hours after he announced his
resignation as head of Stotler Group Inc., a beleaguered
commodities company that operates a subsidiary accused of violating
the Commodity Exchange Act.
   On Tuesday the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed a
federal complaint accusing a Stotler subsidiary of violating the
Commodity Exchange Act. The complaint names Stotler Funds Inc., a
commodity pool operator owned by Stotler Group.
   The CFTC contends Stotler Funds improperly used pools of
clients' money which had been set up for investing in commodity
futures contracts to invest in Stotler Group. Stotler Funds also
lent $1 million from another pool to its parent company.
   Much more publicized problems in the futures industry culminated
last month with the trial of three Swiss franc futures traders. But
a federal jury ended up convicting two of the traders of only
relatively minor trading violations and acquitting the third
defendant of some offenses.
   The jury couldn't reach verdicts on scores of other charges,
including a racketeering count against one defendant and mail- and
wire-fraud charges against all three.
   Officials of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where the traders
worked, said the jury's action somewhat redeemed the market's
reputation.
   The two-month trial was the first to result from an undercover
FBI investigation of corruption at the Merc and the Board of Trade.
In all, 48 people have been indicted since August. Sixteen have
pleaded guilty to reduced charges.
   Two other groups _ 13 soybean traders from the Board of Trade
and 15 yen traders from the Merc _ face trials in September.
   The heavy scrutiny of commodities industry followed the one-day
drop of more than 500 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average _
a key market indicator _ in October 1987 and a 190-point single-day
drop last year.
   A CFTC study after the second drop indicated index arbitrage was
not a major factor in the stock slide. Index arbitrage is a
computerized program trading strategy that seeks to profit from
differences between the stock and futures markets. The study found
no evidence of stock index futures market manipulation.
   The Security and Exchange Commission and other critics of index
arbitrage contend it causes wild price swings. Index arbitragers
try to take advantage of small price differences between the stock
and futures markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one
market while selling in another.
   Most stock index futures are traded on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   To curb volatility, the Bush administration wants to move
authority for stock-index futures from the CFTC to the SEC.
   The CFTC and the futures industry oppose any shift, saying it
will cripple the agency's ability to regulate other futures
porducts and overregualate a segment of an industry that is trying
to stave off foreign competition.
   The Board of Trade came under heavy criticism from farmers and
others last year after it moved to break up an attempt to corner
the soybean market. The CBOT issued an emergency order requiring
the liquidation of large positions in the July soybean futures
contract.
   The order targeted Ferruzzi, an Italian agricultural and
financial firm and one of the world's largest soybean processors.
The order prompted soybean prices to tumble sharply, with
agricultural groups saying the action led to lower prices paid to
producers.
   CBOT board members also were accused of conflict of interest in
ordering the liquidations.
   The CFTC said reasonable grounds existed for the liquidation
order and said it found no evidence of self-dealing by CBOT
officials who might have sold off their holdings after voting to
issue the order.

<HEAD>USX Faces Contract Talks In December</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. Chairman Charles A. Corry said the
steel and energy giant won't take its cue from other major steel
makers in upcoming contract talks with the United Steelworkers of
America.
   ``Our employees and our company need a contract that will ensure
that they are part of a competitive enterprise that can make it and
that will provide them some job security,'' he said Wednesday at a
news conference.
   ``Forget the concept of a pattern,'' he said when asked about
the similarity of contracts agreed to last year by other major
steel companies.
   The chairman previously said those contracts, which restored
labor concessions made during the recession years of the 1980s,
were too generous.
   Corry said negotiations with the union should begin around Dec.
1. The current four-year pact, approved in January 1987 after a
six-month work stoppage, expires Jan. 31. It covers about 18,500
employees.
   He said many of USX's competitors have lower labor costs. He
cited non-union mini mills, union mills with lower labor costs and
financially ailing steel makers that have lower costs while
reorganizing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   ``Our employees have to look at our situation and come up with
something that this company can afford,'' he said.
   Corry said he expects the price of steel, oil and natural gas to
climb in the next five months, boosting profits following a 15
percent drop in second-quarter earnings.
   ``I think the outlook for the second half looks pretty good,''
he said. ``During the first half we lived through one hell of a lot
of volatility in the prices of our primary products.''
   Corry attributed his optimism to the onset of colder weather, an
expected increase in demand for steel and recent efforts by OPEC
oil ministers to raise the price of crude.
   USX said on Tuesday that its second-quarter profit slid to $212
million from $250 million in 1989 as oil gains failed to offset
reduced steel profits and losses from the sale of the company's
natural gas business.
   USX's steel segment earnings dropped 53 percent in the second
quarter, largely due to price erosion that begin in the second half
of 1989 and only recently began to reverse.
   Corry said there is ``no conscious plan'' to shrink the
company's steel division, which he said fared well in the quarter
compared to other large steel makers.
   ``It's making quite a contribution. ... In not a robust
environment in the industry we're able to hold our own,'' he said.
   The future of steel was a central issue May 7 when shareholders
rejected takeover strategist Carl Icahn's proposal to spin off at
least 80 percent of the company's steel division and return
proceeds to shareholders.
   Corry said he has not talked to Icahn, the company's largest
shareholder, since the vote.
   ``I'm not aware of any activities or change in thinking he's had
with respect to his USX stock,'' Corry said.
   Icahn said following his proposal's defeat he had no intention
of selling his stock and would not ``fade into the background.''
   On another matter, Corry said he wrote a letter July 27 to
President Bush, outlining his opposition to initiatives to increase
taxes on energy in an effort to lower the federal budget deficit.
   ``This is a very serious thing for this company because we're in
a unique position of being a big producer of energy products and we
are at the same time, through steel operations, a major consumer of
energy,'' he said.
   He said an increase in energy taxes would hinder the
competitiveness and profitability of American manufacturers and
energy producers.
   Meanwhile, Thomas Graham, president of the steel division, said
the company will begin work Sept. 7 on a continuous slab caster
that will modernize the Edgar Thompson Works south of Pittsburgh in
Braddock.
   He said the $200 million project will take about two years to
complete.

   Stock prices suffered a broad setback today as
news of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait jolted markets around the world.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 16.83 to 2,882.43
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers swamped gainers by more than 3 to 1 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 241 up, 895 down and
297 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.11 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Stock prices tumbled in financial centers of the major
industrialized countries following the overnight news that Iraqi
forces had invaded and taken control of neighboring Kuwait on the
Persian Gulf.
   World oil prices surged upward on the news, propelled by visions
of possible disruptions in the supply of oil from the Middle East.
That, in turn, raised fears of increased inflationary pressures in
the United States and other oil-consuming economies.
   In addition, analysts said investors were fearful that any oil
shock could hit the American economy at a vulnerable time, given
its recent weak pace of growth.
   One of the few pockets of strength among U.S. stocks was the
energy group. Texaco jumped 3\ to 67\; Chevron 2\ to 81, and
Phillips Petroleum 1} to 30{.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included Philip Morris,
down 1&lsqb; at 46}; International Business Machines, down 1} at 109~,
and General Motor $2.62 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $24 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $20.40 per ton, or
about 56 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Continental Grain Co.,
207,900 tons; and Cargill Inc., 40,000 tons.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 2.2 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1990-91 wheat marketing year that
began June 1, compared with 5.6 million tons in 1989-90.

   Rural development councils will be started
this summer in eight states as a forerunner of a nationwide project
to boost development in rural America, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter announced.
   The councils will be started in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi,
Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Washington, he said
Wednesday.
   Existing resources will be used to form the councils, which will
have full-time coordinators, Yeutter said. A goal will be to form
state-level partnerships between federal and state governments and
the private sector.
   ``The participants will create a long-term strategy for applying
federal rural development resources and will carry out joint
actions to implement the strategy,'' Yeutter said.
   Councils will be made up of federal officials representing
various departments and agencies that have significant rural
development roles. Such agencies would include the Extension
Service and the Farmers Home Administration, for example.

   Consumers may have to pay more to gas up their
cars and heat their homes by the end of the year if oil shipments
are disrupted because of Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait, oil
experts said today.
   Prices already have shot up on the wholesale level.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, soared $2.06 to $23.70 a 42-gallon
barrel in early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
unleaded gasoline for September delivery jumped 5.23 cents to 69.50
cents a gallon. Heating oil was up 4.31 cents to 65.50 cents a
gallon.
   ``The costs will have to be passed down to consumers,'' said
Brian Tagler, an oil trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   But it's hard to predict how much more consumers will have to
pay, experts say.
   ``You may not see the impact on the consumer level for at least
four to eight weeks,'' said Edward Ryan, an oil trader with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The current supplies on hand are adequate
and I just don't see retail prices reacting in the same way as on
the wholesale level.''
   Oil producers already are facing a world glut of crude, partly
due to high production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   In the United States, supplies of unleaded gasoline are up about
10 percent from a year ago to 167.2 million barrels from 156.32
million. Crude stocks are up 50 million from 1989, to 338.7 million
barrels from 330.6 million.
   The general rule of thumb, according to industry experts, is
that for every dollar rise in the barrel of crude oil means a rise
of two cents to a nickel at the pumps.
   Tagler said, ``if the United States intervenes on Kuwait's
behalf ... that (also) could bring prices back down.''
   U.S. assistance, he said, could alleviate any possible
disruptions in oil production and shipments in the area, where the
United States gets a significant portion of its oil supplies.
   Iraq and Kuwait produce one-fifth of the total oil produced by
OPEC, but their oil accounts for only an estimated 5 percent of
daily U.S. consumption.
   Iraq's powerful army was reported to have invaded Kuwait early
today, seizing the ruler's palace and government buildings.
   The assault followed three weeks of tension between Kuwait and
Iraq caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from its
territory.
   The Revolutionary Command Council led by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein claimed it invaded Kuwait at the request of revolutionaries
who had already overthrown the government. Kuwait and U.N.
diplomats labeled the coup reports a farce.

<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
fell 1.5 percent in June, continuing their roller-coaster ride
through the first half of 1990, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $237.4 billion
after a 2.2 percent gain in May.
   The choppy performance began in January with a 5.5 percent
decline _ the sharpest drop since a 7.0 percent decrease in
December 1974. Orders also fell 2.1 percent in April and rose 4.0
percent in March and 1.8 percent in February.
   Factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing
industry plans for production. A decrease in orders may forecast a
slump in that sector and layoffs in the future.
   The June decline was led by a 2.8 percent drop in orders for
durable goods _ items expected to last more than three years _ to
$125.1 billion. But the decline was not as sharp as the 3.2 percent
drop when durable goods orders were first reported last week.
   Non-durable goods orders were unchanged at $112.3 billion.
   Over half of the durables decline was in defense goods, which
dropped 20.3 percent to $8.0 billion. Excluding defense, orders
would have dropped 0.7 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders advanced 0.6 percent to $36.1
billion after falling 1.8 percent a month earlier.
   Each of the durable categories posted losses.
   Transportation orders were down 4.9 percent to $33.8 billion
after rising 10.2 percent in May. Excluding transportation, orders
were off 1.0 percent.
   Other durable declines included electrical machinery, down 3.7
percent to $20.0 billion following a 1.4 percent gain the previous
month; primary metals, down 3.0 percent to $11.5 billion after a
2.5 percent advance in May, and non-electrical machinery, off 2.5
percent to $21.7 billion after increasing 3.6 percent.
   Shipments of factory goods in June increased 0.5 percent to
$240.1 billion on top of a 2.0 percent gain in May. But the June
increase in shipments resulted in a 0.5 percent drop in unfilled
orders to $517.7 billion.
   Inventories fell 0.5 percent to $370.5 billion, the third
decrease this year altlhough they were unchanged in May.

<TEXT>
   Aerospace giant Pratt &amp; Whitney, facing
leaner U.S defense budgets, will eliminate 4,000 jobs by 1993,
mostly in Connecticut and Florida, the company announced today.
   The company plans to eliminate about 2,000 jobs from its
Connecticut, Maine and Georgia operations, which have a combined
staff of about 28,300, said Curtis Linke, Pratt &amp; Whitney's vice
president of communications. Most of the jobs are in Connecticut,
which has a total work force of about 25,400.
   The remaining 2,000 jobs will cut from Pratt &amp; Whitney's Florida
work force, which now stands at 8,400.
   The reductions will be accomplished primarily through attrition,
but the jet-engine maker has not ruled out the possibility of some
layoffs, Linke said. Pratt &amp; Whitney has a worldwide work force of
about 45,000.
   The cutbacks would be the second big work force reduction in two
years. The company eliminated 2,650 salaried jobs in 1988 and 1989,
citing intense competition.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney, which depends on defense contracts for about 35
percent of its business, in recent times, has been trying to shift
its operation to a more commercially oriented one to offset losses
due to defense cutbacks.
   The company, the largest division of Hartford-based United
Technologies Corp., has plants in East Hartford, Middletown,
Southington and North Haven.
   In addition to cutbacks here, and Pratt's complex in Palm Beach,
Fla., the company may eliminate jobs at plants in Maine and
Georgia, Linke said.
   Because of its huge business supplying engines for passenger
jets, Pratt &amp; Whitney had hoped to avoid the sweeping cuts under
way at manufacturers more dependent on defense contracts.
   In February, the president of Pratt &amp; Whitney's commercial
engine group, Selwyn D. Berson, said the growing airliner market
was expected to forestall layoffs in Connecticut for the
foreseeable future.
   The company has a $20 billion backlog of civilian engine orders.
Assembly work for those orders have been spread out over a 10 year
period, lessening the company's ability to cushion immediate
defense cuts.
   With easing world tensions, the budget ax is expected to come
down on Pratt-powered Air Force planes, such as the F-15 and F-16
jet fighters, the advanced tactical fighter and the C-17 transport.
   UTC has already been forced to layoff hundreds of workers at
other divisions, including Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford and
Norden Systems in Norwalk, because of defense cuts.

   Prices of wheat futures and most soybean futures
rose in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn futures opened mostly lower, however, amid forecasts for

   Iraq has nearly doubled its share of world oil
supplies by taking control of Kuwait, raising new risks for the
United States and other nations heavily dependent on imported oil,
private energy experts said today.
   That assessment came as President Bush's chief economic adviser
said the U.S. economy should be able to withstand an increase in
oil prices without being pushed into a recession.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said even if the turmoil in the Mideast resulted in a 25
percent rise in oil prices, it would likely have only a modest
adverse impact on U.S. economic growth.
   Fully one-half of U.S. oil supplies are imported, although the
combined shares of the American market for Iraq and Kuwait are less
than 10 percent, according to industry figures.
   In June, the latest month for which figures are available,
Persian Gulf oil represented 24.7 percent of total U.S. oil
imports, according to the American Petroleum Institute, the trade
group for major oil companies. A year earlier the figure was 22.2
percent.
   The United States imported about $2.4 billion in oil and other
goods last year from Iraq, while U.S. exports to Iraq _ led by
agricultural commodities _ totaled $1.17 billion in 1989.
   Iraq is one of the United States' biggest trading partners in
the Arab world, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia. Iraq's leading
exports to the United States are crude oil and dates.
   Kuwait's exports to the United States, also mainly oil, totaled
$973 million last year. Kuwait imported $855 million in U.S. goods,
led by motor vehicles and parts.
   Christopher Flavin, a vice president of the Worldwatch
Institute, said Iraq's invasion of tiny Kuwait may have little
immediate effect on world oil supplies if the conflict does not
escalate and Kuwaiti oil workers cooperate with Iraq.
   A more troubling question, Flavin said, is what step Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein might take toward seeking control of oil
fields elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula.
   By grabbing Kuwait, Saddam has boosted his share of world oil
reserves to 20 percent. Iraq has about 100 billion barrels of
reserves, while Kuwait has about 94 billion, according to figures
published this summer by British Petroleum.
   If Iraq gained control of Saudi Arabia, which ranks as the
world's largest oil exporter and the No. 1 supplier to the United
States, it could garner enough economic clout to hold the world
economy at risk, Flavin said.
   Saudi Arabia, with reported oil reserves of 255 billion barrels,
is the most oil-rich nation in the world.
   Flavin estimated that an Iraqi military move against Saudi
Arabia and the smaller United Arab Emirates could give Saddam
control of 60 percent of total world oil reserves.
   Boskin told the congressional Joint Economic Committee that the
gross national product would be trimmed by ``a few tenths of a
percentage point'' by a 25 percent rise in oil prices.
   ``Even if the higher price is enforced, our economy today is
much better able to absorb modest price increases,'' Boskin said.
   But he conceded that a rise in world oil prices would have
``some deleterious impact on our economy.'' The impact, he said,
would be more harmful on the Japanese economy because of its
greater dependence on imports from OPEC.
   Boskin's scheduled appearance before Congress was to explain the
administration's downward economic forecasts for 1990 and 1991 and
the impact those revisions have had on the budget deficit.

<HEAD>The Energy Problem Drifts Into The Background</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans have had their fill of crises, real or
imagined, and can hardly tolerate another. It probably explains why
the energy problem has fallen into the background.
   But there is uncomfortable news in the background, and it might
be summarized in three sentences: American production of crude oil
is falling. Consumption is rising. Imports account for half of U.S.
supplies.
   These ingredients mean an inevitable crisis, the only unknown
being its timing and extent. The timing could be sometime in the
next century; it also could be as imminent as the next time warfare
threatens in the Middle East.
   The U.S. economy runs on energy. That is, the nation's
factories, homes and means of transportation depend on it. As
history has demonstrated, a shortage can stall an automobile or an
economy with equal effectiveness.
   Recognizing this, America went on an energy-saving crusade
beginning in the 1970s. Old homes and factories were insulated and
standards for new ones were raised. Alternative energy supplies
were encouraged and businesses for that purpose were founded.
   Much of that seems like a memory now, akin to the lingering
thoughts some people have of blackouts and ration cards during
World public emotion _ hostility and
compassion, frustration and sympathy _ has escalated as the ranks
of the homeless swell.
   ``People are frustrated it's not over. We're into quick fixes,''
said Mary Ann Gleason, director of the Denver Healthcare for the
Homeless Clinic, which serves about 6,500 people a year. ``There
are hundreds of thousands of people we've gotten off the streets,
but there are more falling in behind them.''
   No one knows how many Americans are homeless. Estimates range
from 300,000 to 3 million. But no one disputes the fact that the
number is increasing, and greater numbers mean greater visibility.
   ``It's a common perception that at least among some parts of
society, there's not only less compassion but more organized
hostility'' toward the homeless, said Gary Blasi, president of the
National Coaltion for the Homeless and a Legal Aid Foundation
attorney in Los Angeles, a city with a homeless population
estimated at more than 150,000.
   ``A large part of the source of the hostility is that it's not
great to have a lot of homeless people around when you're a tourist
city,'' Blasi said. ``It's not just the cable cars and the Golden
Gate anymore.''
   What passes for heartlessness often is case of empty municipal
pockets, with compassionate programs succumbing to financial
pressures. The city council in Washington, faced with a $95 million
budget deficit, voted in June to gut its policy of guaranteeing
overnight shelter to anyone who requested it. That ordinance was
championed by the late homeless activist Mitch Snyder and passed
six years ago by more than 70 percent of the vote.
   In Philadelphia, 80 members of the Mayor's Public-Private Task
Force on Homelessness resigned in July to protest massive cuts in
the city's budget for homeless services after the amount dropped
from $34 million to $10 million in two years. At the same time, the
city plans to spend $1 million closing off spaces under train
platforms in a downtown station where people like to sleep.
   ``I see no abatement whatsoever in people's concern, people
calling, people coming in, people of all ages making an effort and
reaching out,'' said Phyllis Ryan, director of the Philadelphia
Committee for the Homeless and one of the former task force
members. ``The government resources have just not been sufficient.
I think they just looked out there and decided who's a voter and
who isn't.''
   In some places, voters aggravated by the homeless problem are
using their electoral clout to protest. Residents in Santa Monica,
Calif., have collected thousands of signatures to place a
proposition on the November ballot to make the city attorney's
office an elected one. The current city attorney, Robert Myers, has
refused to prosecute people for sleeping outdoors.
   ``I think there's an increasing feeling of helplessness,'' said
Barbara Stinchfield, Santa Monica's community development manager.
``We get proposals weekly ... on how to solve the homeless problem.
It's frustrating, it's troubling, it's unsettling, it's not getting
better. But most people are not reacting in a really destructive
way.''
   Citizens in Santa Cruz, Calif., took their anger to the streets.
When 200 homeless activists rallied outside the Santa Cruz County
Courthouse demanding an end to the city's camping ban, they were
outnumbered by 600 counterdemonstrators who said they were tired of
giving ``bums'' and ``squatters'' a free ride in the seaside town
about 75 miles south of San Francisco.
   ``I think what happened in Santa Cruz and San Francisco has to
do with something much bigger than homelessness,'' Gleason said.
   The American public, she believes, feels angry but helpless over
things like the HUD scandal and the savings-and-loan bailout: ``I
think people are feeling so frustrated from being bamboozled and
taken advantage of on every front, homelessness gets lumped in with
the rest of it. It's very easy to take your anger out on the poor.''
   It's more difficult to find effective solutions to the problem,
but citizens in Seattle are trying, said Martha Dilts, executive
director of Seattle Emergency Housing Service.
   Seattle residents are trying to raise $1 million for
transitional housing for homeless families, and a local real estate
company's agents are donating part of their commissions to fight
homelessness.
   ``I see people starting to realize that homelessness is
affecting more people, that it could happen to your family or your
neighbor. There's a feeling of community and a sense of `We can do
it,''' said Dilts, a member of the governor's homeless task force.
   Advocates agree that homelessness will persist until society
deals with the lack of affordable housing, access to drug treatment
and mental health facilities and absence of affordable childcare
and other support services for the working poor. Meanwhile, cities
are being forced to expand and improve shelter facilities,
something many communities are loathe to do.
   Although Washington has been under court order to expand its
shelter system, council members say neighborhoods will not accept
one without a fight. In one area, a homeless man's arrest on murder
charges galvanized the neighbors; they held bake sales to finance
their effort to close the shelter in which he lived.
   In a suburban Westchester County, N.Y., community, neighbors
have filed five lawsuits to try to stop construction of a 108-unit
complex for homeless women and children. In a San Jose, Calif.,
neighborhood, residents are fighting a homeless shelter they
believe is responsible for a 120 percent increase in felonies in
their area.
   ``If there was a shred of sympathy in me before,'' one resident
said, ``after seeing this, I have lost all compassion.''
   Sometimes, however, neighbors find the cure far less painful
than they had anticipated. A project to help mentally ill homeless
women in Denver was welcomed into a neighborhood after residents'
fears were allayed by the project's planners. The house has been a
smashing, problem-free success: 78 percent of those who passed
through there in the first year now have homes, and neighbors now
drop by to donate lawn chairs and tomato plants.
   ``I don't think the American public knows what's going on in
homeless services today,'' Gleason said. ``Part of it is
misinformation, part of it is honest-to-God displaced anger. When
people understand both what the homeless reality is, and what we're
trying to do about it, it paints a whole different picture.''

<HEAD>Midland Bank Posts Slim Profit, Announces 4,000 Job Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midland Bank PLC, hurt by high interest rates and
smaller margins, on Thursday posted a slim net profit of 22 million
pounds, or about $40.5 million, in the first half of the year.
   Midland also announced it was cutting 4,000 jobs from its work
force of 33,000. The firm said the cuts should be implemented by
the end of 1991, mostly through attrition and voluntary departures.
   Midland said its net profit for the six months ended June 30
came to 1.3 pence, or about 2.4 cents per share. That compared with
a net loss of 383 million pounds, or about $705 million, in the
1989 period, when the bank substantially raised its provisions
against bad loans to Third World countries.
   On a pre-tax basis, the company had a profit of 36 million
pounds, or about $66 million, compared with a loss of 531 million
pounds, or $977 million, in the year-earlier period.
   Pre-tax profit before loan provisions and exceptional charges
fell 19 percent to 363 million pounds, or about $668 million, from
440 million pounds ($810 million).
   Midland Chairman Sir Kit McMahon said the results were
unacceptable but that refocusing the bank's operations toward
investment banking, coupled with reducing assets and propping up
the bank's capital for future growth, should help generate some
added profitability over the next six months.
   Operating income was little changed at 1.55 billion pounds ($2.9
billion). Operating costs, partly due to a move to improve
technology and expand certain British operations, rose 10 percent
to 1.2 billion pounds ($2.2 billion).
   The bank is not required to report quarterly results. All
figures were converted at the current exchange rate of 1.84
American dollars to the pound.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Rise Following Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates thruout with closing figures in Europe, midday prices
in New York.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose today against major currencies in
trading in Europe following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Gold prices rose.
   News of the Iraqi invasion early Thursday drove world oil prices
sharply higher and sent foreign exchange traders scrambling to buy
dollars, a potentially safe haven currency.
   The dollar's advance was underpinned by news of U.S. economic
sanctions against Iraq and strong condemnations from other major
industrialized nations against the Baghdad government's actions.
   The hardest-hit currency was the yen, which is especially
vulnerable to oil price fluctuations because Japan imports nearly
all its oil.
   As the day wore on, the dollar fell back from its peaks in thin
trading, dealers said.
   Mike Lovell, senior corporate dealer for Bank of America in
London, said the dollar was ``trading off what the next headline
is'' about Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``It had been very choppy and prone to react to rumors,'' he
added.
   William Simpson, money market economist with Barclays Bank,
added that the threat of oil-supply disruptions in the Persian Gulf
was helping to draw interest back to the dollar.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.90 yen, up 2.25 yen from
Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 149.60
yen and it was quoted at 149.275 yen at midday in New York.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8495 from $1.8550 late
Wednesday. In New York, the pound was quoted at midday at $1.85375.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.5970 West German marks, up from 1.5920;
1.3570 Swiss francs, up from 1.3555; 5.3510 French francs, up from
5.3355; 1.7985 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7935; 1,168.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,164.75, and 1.1519 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1530.
   Selected dollar rates at midday in New York included: 1.5915
West German marks, 1.3560 Swiss francs, 1,166.00 Italian lire and
1.15225 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to $378.75 a troy ounce from $374.30 late
Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to $379.00 an ounce from $371.50 late
Tuesday. The market was closed Wednesday for a holiday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $7.93 an ounce to close at $379.39.
   Silver bullion rose in London to $4.87 a troy ounce from $4.82
late Wednesday.

   Stock prices finished sharply lower Thursday,
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Excluding the oil sector, stocks were knocked broadly lower as
the market interpreted the events in the Persian Gulf to mean that
higher oil prices would boost British inflation beyond its current
9.8 percent level and keep U.K. interest rates at the very least at
their present 15 percent levels.
   ``We see the non-oil Western economies, with the exception of
the U.S., facing the possibility of now having to tighten interest
rates to counteract increased inflationary prospects,'' said Paul
Harrison, a vice president at Salomon Brothers International in
London.
   Wall Street also acted as a drag on the London market, dealers
said. By the close of the European day, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 38.86 points at 2,860.40.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 34.5
points, or 1.5 percent, at 2,304.5 at the close. The session peak
was 2,347.9.
   The Financial Times 30-share index fell 41.4 points to close at
1,811.4. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 16.04 points to
close at 1,248.86.
   Volume came to 561.5 million shares, compared with 419.2 million
shares Wednesday.

<HEAD>Bear, Stearns Quarterly Profits Down 30 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bear Stearns Cos. said Thursday that earnings
tumbled about 30 percent in its fourth quarter and full fiscal
year, reflecting a continued slowdown in investment banking and
retail brokerage.
   Bear Stearns reported profits of $33.5 million, or 32 cents a
share, in its fourth quarter ended June 30. That was down 29.6
percent from profits of $47.6 million, or 43 cents a share, in the
year-ago period.
   Revenue totaled $640 million, up 16 percent from $630 million a
year earlier.
   ``Fiscal 1990, particularly the first six months, was a tough
year for the investment banking and brokerage industry,'' Bear
Stearns Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said in a statement.
   ``I have heard that we are in a cyclical business. I am eagerly
awaiting the next upward cycle,'' he said.
   Greenberg said the firm's fourth-quarter profits were helped by
good performances in mortgage-backed securities, government bond
and equity trading areas.
   For its full fiscal year, Bear Stearns reported profits of
$119.4 million, or $1.10 a share, down 30.7 percent from $172.4
million, or $1.54 a share, in fiscal 1989. Annual revenue was $2.4
billion, about the same as in fiscal 1989.
   Bear Stearns is the parent of the investment firm Bear, Stearns

   Stock prices fell sharply today as news of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait jolted markets around the world.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 33.17 points to
2,866.09 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 380 up,
1,232 down and 330 unchanged.
   Stock prices tumbled in financial centers of the major
industrialized countries following the overnight news that Iraqi
forces had invaded and taken control of neighboring Kuwait on the
Persian Gulf.
   World oil prices surged upward on the news, propelled by visions
of possible disruptions in the supply of oil from the Middle East.
That, in turn, raised fears of increased inflationary pressures in
the United States and other oil-consuming economies.
   In addition, analysts said investors were fearful that any oil
shock could hit the American economy at a vulnerable time, given
its recent weak pace of growth.
   One of the few pockets of strength among U.S. stocks was the
energy group. Texaco jumped 1} to 65}; Amoco 2 to 57&rsqb;; Atlantic
Richfield 4} to 135\; Exxon 1| to 53}, and Unocal 2 to 33&lsqb;.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included Boeing, down 1~
at 53~; American Express, down 1&lsqb; at 27{; Philip Morris, down ~ at
47, and General Motors, down 1| at 43}.
   The NYSE's composite index ots at controlling
production.
   Iraq assaulted its much-smaller neighbor less than a week after
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signed an accord
designed to restore production discipline to the sometimes unruly
organization.
   ``It takes that piece of paper, puts a light to it and sends it
up the chimney,'' said Peter Gignoux, director of the international
energy department at Shearson Lehman Hutton in London.
   The invasion also reinforced suspicions that the cartel might be
increasingly controlled by the whims of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   Hussein's military threats against Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates were seen as a motivating factor in last week's agreement.
He had complained that his country lost $14 billion in oil revenue
in the past year because Kuwait and the U.A.E cheated on their OPEC
supply quotas and forced down crude prices.
   ``It weakens the organization because one country now dominates
completely and imposes its will on (the others),'' said Peter
Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge Energy
Research Associates in Paris.
   But others said the invasion reflected changes that might signal
greater discipline.
   ``Up until now, the cartel lacked an enforcement mechanism,''
said Nauman Barakat in Shearson's energy department in New York.
``We do now have that mechanism _ Saddam Hussein _ to make sure
policies are enforced very vigorously.''
   There was no comment from OPEC. ``This is a political thing,''
said one cartel official, demanding anonymity. ``It has nothing to
do with us.''
   The agreement, signed last Friday by all 13 nations, boosted
OPEC's target price to $21 a barrel from the $18 mark in effect
since December 1986. Iraq had argued for a $25 price.
   Analysts said the target was likely hit _ or even surpassed _
when crude prices surged Thursday on worries that the Iraqi
invasion could disrupt supplies in the Persian Gulf. The average
price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel was $17.50 last
week.
   As part of their accord, OPEC ministers promised to limit total
output to 22.5 million barrels a day for the rest of the year,
above the ceiling of 22.1 million barrels in the first half of
1990. Actual output was put at about 23.2 million barrels in July.
   The arrangement also lifted the U.A.E.'s production quota by
400,000 barrels to 1.5 million barrels a day to try to end that
country's cheating. the U.A.E. pumped 2 million barrels daily in
July, according to new estimates from the International Energy
Agency.
   With Iraq's aggression, the U.A.E. _ another small Gulf state _
will be even more inclined to halt excess production, analysts said.
   Kuwait's supply cap remains at 1.5 million barrels a day. It was
producing about 100,000 barrels over that last month, although it
had gone much higher earlier in the year, analysts said.
   Iraq, because of its oil might, long has been a powerful OPEC
member. With Iran, it holds the second largest production quota at
3.1 million barrels a day each.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, pumps about a
quarter of the cartel's oil, with a quota of 5.4 million barrels.

   Oil and gold prices and the dollar soared today on
world financial markets after Iraq's invasion of Iraq, but then
fell back when buyers decided they had overeacted.
   Oil prices were nearly $2 a barrel higher late in the day after
rising more than $3 in frenzied trading earlier on concerns the
invasion would disrupt supplies.
   Iraq and Kuwait are among the world's biggest oil producers and
represent more than 20 percent of OPEC's output.
   The dollar jumped most sharply against the Japanese yen, because
the American currency is viewed as a haven and Japan imports 99
percent of its oil.
   Gold, also regarded as a safe investment during times of
turmoil, finished in London with a gain of more than $4 a troy
ounce, after having moved as much as $14 higher than Wednesday's
finish earlier in the day.
   Stock prices fell on inflationary fears but oil-related shares
benefited.
   There was confusion in the financial markets following today's
invasion.
   ``There are a lot of wild cards out there,'' said Peter Gignoux,
manager of the international energy desk at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. in London.
   Ted Arnold, a metals specialist at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Smith Ltd. in London, said: ``The market at this stage is very,
very confused. No one is certain what is going to happen.''
   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded
international crude oil, stood at $22.39 a barrel by late Thursday
afternoon, up from Wednesday's London close of $20.40.
   The last time oil prices moved up this sharply was during the
Iranian revolution in 1979, Gignoux said.
   Trading on the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp spot oil market was
disorderly, and one Rotterdam broker complained of difficulty in
getting accurate price quotes.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.90 yen, up 2.25 yen from
Wednesday's close and later in London, the dollar was quoted at a
higher rate of 149.60 yen. Gold was quoted at a late spot bid of
$378.75 per ounce in London, up from $374.30 late Wednesday.
   A main concern is that higher oil prices will fuel inflation in
major industrial countries.
   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index dropped
34.5 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 2,304.5.
   In light of Britain's decision to freeze all Kuwaiti assets, the
London Stock Exchange late Thursday advised members to review all
its securities transactions entered into on behalf of the
government or residents of Kuwait.
   The Stock Exchange advised member firms not to undertake any
further business on behalf of such investors and suggested that its
members ``explore the possibility of cancelling all such
transactions entered into'' today.
   Peter Nicol, an analyst with the London investment firm Warburg
Securities, said he didn't expect any actual disruption of oil
supplies, and that prices could drift back down if there is not
``major escalation of news.''
   But Nicol said the fear of disruption ``is genuine and people
are right to be concerned. It makes people focus again on the
security of supplies.''
   Countries that depend on Kuwait and Iraqi oil could easily
switch to other suppliers in a global market that, at the moment,
is awash in oil.
   However, North Sea production currently is down to 1.9 million
barrels a day, instead of up to 2.3 million barrels a day, because
fields are shut down for routine summer maintenance. Today, oil
workers began a 24-hour wildcat strike to protest safety standards.
   At the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries last week, Iraq pressed for a target price of $25 a
barrel and for output curbs.
   Under last week's pact, Iraq has a quota of 3.14 million barrels
a day, and Kuwait of 1.5 million barrels a day under OPEC's
production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day for the second
half of the year. The 13-member cartel's oil target price is $21 a
barrel.
   OPEC currently is producing about 23 million barrels a day,
Nicol said.

   Iraq's invasion of fellow OPEC member
Kuwait may have dealt a sharp blow to the cartel's attempts at
solidarity in restraining oil output and gradually raising world
crude prices, analysts said Thursday.
   Although oil prices shot higher Thursday following news of the
invasion, Thursday, analysts said the long-term impact of the
assault possibly could be to weaken OPEC's attempts at controlling
production.
   Iraq assaulted its much-smaller neighbor less than a week after
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signed an accord
designed to restore production discipline to the sometimes unruly
organization.
   ``It takes that piece of paper, puts a light to it and sends it
up the chimney,'' said Peter Gignoux, director of the international
energy department at Shearson Lehman Hutton in London.
   The invasion also reinforced suspicions that the cartel might be
increasingly controlled by the whims of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   Saddam's military threats against Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates were seen as a motivating factor in last week's agreement.
He had complained that his country lost $14 billion in oil revenue
in the past year because Kuwait and the U.A.E cheated on their OPEC
supply quotas and forced down crude prices.
   ``It weakens the organization because one country now dominates
completely and imposes its will on (the others),'' said Peter
Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge Energy
Research Associates in Paris.
   But others said the invasion reflected changes that might signal
greater discipline.
   ``Up until now, the cartel lacked an enforcement mechanism,''
said Nauman Barakat in Shearson's energy department in New York.
``We do now have that mechanism _ Saddam Hussein _ to make sure
policies are enforced very vigorously.''
   There was no comment from OPEC. ``This is a political thing,''
said one cartel official, demanding anonymity. ``It has nothing to
do with us.''
   The agreement, signed last Friday by all 13 nations, boosted
OPEC's target price to $21 a barrel from the $18 mark in effect
since December 1986. Iraq had argued for a $25 price.
   Analysts said the target was likely hit _ or even surpassed _
when crude prices surged Thursday on worries that the Iraqi
invasion could disrupt supplies in the Persian Gulf. The average
price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel was $17.50 last
week.
   As part of their accord, OPEC ministers promised to limit total
output to 22.5 million barrels a day for the rest of the year,
above the ceiling of 22.1 million barrels in the first half of
1990. Actual output was put at about 23.2 million barrels in July.
   The arrangement also lifted the U.A.E.'s production quota by
400,000 barrels to 1.5 million barrels a day to try to end that
country's cheating. the U.A.E. pumped 2 million barrels daily in
July, according to new estimates from the International Energy
Agency.
   With Iraq's aggression, the U.A.E. _ another small Gulf state _
will be even more inclined to halt excess production, analysts said.
   Kuwait's supply cap remains at 1.5 million barrels a day. It was
producing about 100,000 barrels over that last month, although it
had gone much higher earlier in the year, analysts said.
   Iraq, because of its oil might, long has been a powerful OPEC
member. With Iran, it holds the second largest production quota at
3.1 million barrels a day each.
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, pumps about a
quarter of the cartel's oil, with a quota of 5.4 million barrels.

   Wheat futures prices closed slightly higher
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade but the corn and soybean
markets fell, extending Wednesday's losses amid forecasts for more
good crop weather in the Midwest.
   The markets got an early boost from the overwhelmingly bullish
sentiment that flooded the crude oil and precious metal markets
following news that Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   But the event had no real effect on grain supply and demand, so
traders returned their attention to predictions that a beneficial
weather pattern of mild temperatures and occasional showers will
continue in the Midwest, said William Biedermann, research director
with the futures brokerage Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 3{ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.83 a bushel; corn
was unchanged to 3{ cents lower with September at $2.52{ a bushel;
oats were 2{ cents to 4{ cents lower with September at $1.18{ a

<HEAD>Grace Board Names Bolduc As President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemical giant W.R. Grace &amp; Co. said Thursday
its board has selected vice chairman J.P. Bolduc as president and
chief operating officer.
   Bolduc, 51, will succeed Charles H. Erhart Jr., 65, who is
retiring as president but will continue as a director.
   Erhart had been president for a little more than a year. The
post of chief operating officer has been vacant since 1986.
   The selection was announced by J. Peter Grace, chairman and
chief executive of the $6.1 billion diversified specialty chemical
company.
   It appears to put Bolduc in line to succeed Grace should the
77-year-old chairman decide to step down. Grace has given no
indication he intends to step down. But Grace spokesman Fred Bona
said that with the new assignment, Bolduc ``is clearly No. 2 in the
company.''
   Bolduc had been one of three Grace vice chairmen who since 1986
have had operating control over various facets of the company.
   The others are J. Murfree Butler and Joseph R. Wright Jr. who
will continue as vice chairmen and report to a restructured office
of the chairman and president.
   Bolduc will be the company's ninth president since its
incorporation in 1899. He joined the company in 1983 as a senior
vice president and later became executive vice president and chief
financial officer.
   He was involved in Grace's restructuring that began in 1986 and
most recently had corporate operating responsibility for Grace's
energy, health care and specialty businesses groups that include
cocoa production, book distribution and specialty textiles and
agriculture.
   Before joining Grace in February 1983, he was vice president and
partner at Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., a management and technical
consulting firm.
   He served as an assistant secretary for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture under Presidents Nixon and Ford. He also was chief
operating officer for President Reagan's Private Sector Survey on
Cost Control in the Federal Government, better known as the Grace
Commission, that recommended ways the government could operate more
efficiently.
   W.R. Grace employs about 51,000 people in 46 states and 44
countries.

   The dollar rocketed higher Thursday after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait sent currency investors scrambling to a safe
haven. But the buying frenzy faded in later trading and the dollar
ended the day well off its peaks.
   Gold gained strongly on world markets.
   Foreign exchange dealers in Asia, Europe and the United States
reported business was extremely brisk, particularly in the first
hours after news broke that Iraqi troops had moved into neighboring
Kuwait.
   ``It has been a little bit crazy looking back over the last 24
hours,'' said Peter Wild, treasurer at the Swiss bank Bank Julius
Baer &amp; Co. in New York.
   The dollar rode a roller coaster. It was driven up steeply
against all its major foreign counterparts in the early going as
panicky investors poured money into dollars as a way of protecting
themselves against the instability caused by the Persian Gulf
turmoil.
   Later, the U.S. currency fell back to earth when dealers took
advantage of the surge to sell and collect profits on their dollar
holdings.
   Concern about weak U.S. economic growth in light of recent poor
reports damped enthusiasm for dollars. Statistics due Friday on
unemployment during July were widely awaited by the financial
markets.
   Only the Japanese yen failed to regain much of the ground it
lost to the dollar. Dealers unloaded yen due to concern that Japan
would be hurt more than any other major industrialized country by
disruptions in Mideast oil supplies. Japan depends on imports for
nearly all its oil needs.
   By the time trading was done in New York, the dollar stood at
149.30 yen, up from 147.30 yen Wednesday but below an earlier high
of nearly 150 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 148.90 yen, up
2.25 yen from Wednesday's close and in London the dollar was quoted
at 149.60 yen.
   The dollar's advance was underpinned by news of U.S. economic
sanctions against Iraq and strong condemnations from other major
industrialized nations against the Baghdad government's actions.
   British sterling lost some ground against the dollar. A pound
was quoted at $1.8545 late in New York, compared to $1.8552 late
Wednesday. In London, the British pound fell to $1.8495 from
$1.8550 late Wednesday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with
Wednesday's late quotes, included: 1.5910 German marks, up from
1.58885; 1.3530 Swiss francs, down from 1.3540; 5.3320 French
francs, up from 5.3240; 1,164.50 Italian lire, up from 1,162.75;
and 1.15125 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15275.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late levels Wednesday
were: 1.5970 West German marks, up from 1.5920; 1.3570 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3555; 5.3510 French francs, up from 5.3355;
1.7985 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7935; 1,168.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,164.75; and 1.1519 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1530.
   Precious metals, often considered a safe haven in times of
international tension, rose in world trading.
   Gold for current delivery added $3.50 a troy ounce on New York's
Commodity Exchange, settling at $376.80. Republic National Bank
later quoted a bid of $376.90 a troy ounce, up $3.40 from
Wednesday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   In London, gold rose to $378.75 a troy ounce from $374.30 late
Wednesday. Gold rose in Zurich to $379.00 an ounce from $371.50
late Tuesday. The market was closed Wednesday for a holiday.
Earlier, gold in Hong Kong rose $7.93 an ounce to close at $379.39.
   Silver firmed also. On New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery settled at $4.835 a troy ounce, up from $4.822 Wednesday.
In London, silver rose to $4.87 a troy ounce from $4.82 late
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Union pilots who joined a strike against Eastern
Airlines have the right to replace trainees hired during the
carrier's rebuilding, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
   ``It's clearly a major victory,'' said E.J. Breen, spokesman for
the Air Line Pilots Association, which challenged an Eastern claim
that returning pilots were not needed.
   But Eastern planned to appeal the decision and officials said
there will be no immediate effect on current employees or
operations.
   A statement by Eastern indicated its ``appeal is likely to take
some time.''
   All but 200 of the 3,600 ALPA pilots walked off the job in
sympathy with striking Machinists in March 1989. Pilots ended their
strike last November, but fewer than 50 have been recalled to the
Miami-based airline, ALPA officials said.
   In a 12-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Edward Davis
agreed with ALPA's claims that the federal Railway Labor Act
guarantees returning strikers job rights ahead of the newly hired
trainees.
   ``The court must balance competing interests: the right of
striking pilots to return to jobs against management's efforts to
maintain the status quo throughout the strike,'' Davis wrote.
``This court concludes the balance weighs in favor of reinstating
in place of trainees.''
   Breen said the exact number of jobs affected by the ruling
likely will be determined through further hearings. But ALPA
contends that at least 404 pilots were in training when pilots
ended their strike in November and are subject to replacement.
   Eastern spokewoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline estimates 180
jobs are affected by the ruling.
   About 1,400 former Eastern pilots may still be interested in
returning, said ALPA spokesman Lou Baldwin in Miami. Many of the
pilots were hired by other airlines following the strike that began
March 4, 1989.
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection five days
after the strike began and presently operates about 800 flights
from its pre-strike service of 1,040.
   Ms. Ceremsak said she does not believe Davis' ruling must
receive bankruptcy court approval.
   Davis concluded Eastern's hiring of pilot trainees violated the
Railway Labor Act because the company did not bring on workers
already qualified to fly regular flights. The purpose of the act it
to provide ``uninterrupted transportation service,'' Davis ruled.
   ``Contracting with unqualified persons for future employment as
pilots does not serve to fill the void left by the striking pilots
_ as least not until some later date,'' Davis wrote.
   The ruling stems from an August 1989 court filing by Eastern
seeking a judgment that it need not replace newly hired pilots with
returning pilots.
   Baldwin said the Eastern pilots trainees' annual pay of about
$27,000 is significantly higher than the industry average. The
average pre-strike pay at Eastern for fully accredited pilots was
about $65,000, he said.
   If Davis' ruling is upheld on appeal, all returning pilots would
need to go through several weeks of recertification training under
the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern officials said.

   Assets of the nation's 521 money market mutual
funds rose $800.1 million in the latest week to a new high, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to $395.42 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $1.88 billion revised increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The total was revised back to July 4 to include eight newly
reporting institutional funds with assets of $2.8 billion.
   The previous high in the funds' assets was $392.14 billion in
the week ended March 21, 1990.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 251 general purpose funds rose $541.5 million to $136.44
billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds rose $258.7 million to
$161.01 billion, and assets of 168 institutional funds fell
$100,000 to $97.97 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.56 percent from 7.59 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.62 percent from 7.65 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
44 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.11 percent as of Wednesday from 6.12 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.02 percent from 5.03 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.81
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.86 the
previous week. Yields were 7.97 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.03 percent; 8.02 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.06 percent;
and 8.11 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.14 percent.

   Stock prices sustained widespread losses
Thursday in the heaviest trading of the year as news of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait jolted markets around the world.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 34.66 points to
2,864.60.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
464 up, 1,211 down and 349 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 253.09 million

   Stock prices tumbled in financial centers of the major
industrialized countries following the overnight news that Iraqi
forces had invaded and taken control of neighboring Kuwait on the
Persian Gulf.
   World oil prices surged upward on the news, propelled by visions
of possible disruptions in the supply of oil from the Middle East.
That, in turn, raised fears of increased inflationary pressures in
the United States and other oil-consuming economies.
   In the bond market, which is especially sensitive to changes in
inflationary expectations, prices of long-term government bonds
fell more than $10 for each $1,000 in face value, raising their
yields to the 8.45 percent-8.48 percent range.
   In addition, analysts said investors were fearful that any oil
shock could hit the American economy at a vulnerable time, given
its recent weak pace of growth.

<HEAD>Gold's Reaction to Iraq News Disappoints Bulls</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices ended moderately higher Thursday on New
York's Commodity Exchange after paring gains of more than $10 an
ounce in a move inspired by Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.
   The performance disappointed market bulls, but analysts said it
could be several days before the dust settles and reveals whether
gold has ended its recent upward trend.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures soared; livestock and
meat futures were down sharply; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3.40 to $3.50 higher with the contract for
delivery in August at $376.80 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to
1.3 cents higher with August at $4.835 a troy ounce.
   August gold traded as high as $386.50 during the session,
posting its strongest gains just after the opening as traders
reacted to news of the Iraq-Kuwait conflict. Demand for gold
typically rises during times of international hostitility and
economic uncertainty.
   Reports that Iraqi troops had seized the Kuwaiti capital
prompted frenzied buying of petroleum futures and aggressive
selling of stocks. Those events also sent strong buy signals to the
gold market.
   Analysts said the conquest of Kuwait catapulted Iraq to the top
ranks of world oil powers and posed new economic risks for the
United States and other countries dependent on imported oil.
   But after the early price spike, selling gradually eroded most
of gold's gains. And even though the market settled at or above a
level that only a day before had been considered a key test of the
market's underlying strength, analysts said the close was
disappointing.
   ``It's really hard to feel exuberant about the gold market
considering it finished near the lows of the day,'' said Craig
Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New
York.
   But Sloane said the market typically takes a day or two to
adjust after a major event such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I would regard tomorrow as a real good test,'' he said. ``If
this market wants to trade well, we'll have to do better tomorrow.''
   Petroluem futures also closed below the day's highs on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. But prices still ended dramatically
higher in reaction to a swiftly imposed U.S. ban on Iraqi imports
in response to the attack.
   Iraqi oil accounts for about 8 percent of U.S. oil imports.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 72 cents to $1.57
higher with September at $23.11 a barrel; heating oil was 2.15
cents to 3.5 cents higher with September at 64.69 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 3 cents to 3.8 cents higher with September at
68.07 cents a gallon.
   Weak cash markets sent pork futures down sharply for the second
straight day on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. All frozen pork
belly contracts plunged the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a
pound; near-term hog futures fell their limit of 1.5 cents.
   Cattle futures also fell but closed above the day's lows.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent to .65 cent lower with August at
77.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .62 cent lower
with August at 88.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .65 cent to 1.5
cents lower with August at 58.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were 2 cents lower across the board with August at 47.22 cents a
pound.
   Wheat futures prices rose slightly on the Chicago Board of Trade
but the corn and soybean markets fell, extending Wednesday's losses
amid forecasts for more good crop weather in the Midwest.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 3{ cents higher with
September at $2.83 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 3 cents lower
with September at $2.52} a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 4\ cents
lower with September at $1.18} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 4}
cents lower with August at $5.80\ a bushel.

   Kuwait's invasion of Iraq shook financial
markets around the world Thursday, sending oil prices, the dollar
and interest rates soaring and stock prices reeling.
   Crude oil rose $1.57 a barrel in New York futures trading and
nearly $2 in London, unleashing fears of a resurgence of inflation
and a possible recession in the United States that affected other
markets
   Oil prices were boosted by the possibility the invasion
eventually could affect output from the two nations or other
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose $1.57 to $23.11 a barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Later months advanced $1, the limit
for one-day advances in those contracts.
   Prices soared on the opening of trading, with the September
contract reaching $23.80, but lost ground after reports circulated
that Iraq might withdraw its troops within 48 hours.
   Earlier in London, the spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the
most widely traded international crude oil, finished at $22.39 a
barrel, up nearly $2 from Wednesday but down from its highs of the
day.
   ``It's been a rumor-driven market,'' said Greg Dreis, a trader
with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Traders said they had not seen oil prices shoot up as fast since
1979, when the Iranian revolution also raised concerns about the
flow of oil from the Middle East.
   But trading was checked somewhat by the knowledge that other oil
producers, including OPEC's biggest member, Saudi Arabia, could
increase their output and provide a safety valve against a severe
drop in oil shipments.
   ``They have the potential to make up for a substantial portion
if not all of any deficit,'' said William Byers, an analyst with
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   Trading was similar for the dollar, which rose in early trading
before falling back somewhat.
   The U.S. currency got a two-fold boost: The dollar is considered
a safe haven for investors during world strife, and it is the
medium of exchange for crude oil. Analysts said traders who have
shied away from it recently were buying heavily in early trading to
adjust their holdings.
   But the dollar, which has been depressed in recent weeks because
of the weakening U.S. economy, gave up some of its gains as foreign
exchange traders later grew pessimistic about the economic
ramifications of surging oil prices.
   With oil and other energy sources crucial for every segment of
the economy, rising crude prices can reinvigorate inflation. That
would make the Federal Reserve _ which considers fighting inflation
one of its top priorities _ less likely to move interest rates
lower.
   ``Even if the Fed eased (credit), it would be more tentative,''
said Raymond Stone, a managing director of Stone &amp; McCarthy
Research Associates Inc.
   ``If these oil prices stick, it means the country will be that
much closer to recession,'' Stone said.
   The dollar closed at 1.5910 West German marks, up from 1.58885
late Wednesday in New York trading. The British pound, which has
stormed higher against the dollar recently, slipped to $1.8545 from
$1.8552.
   The Japanese yen fell sharply, as Japan imports 99 percent of
its oil and would be hurt by a surge in oil prices. The dollar rose
to 149.30 yen from late Thursday's 147.30.
   Stock and bond prices also were depressed by fears about the
economy.
   On Wall Street, traders were concerned about the effect oil
prices would have on corporate profits. Heavy selling sent stock
prices broadly lower.
   The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue chip stocks dropped
34.66 points to 2,864.60. On the broader market, declining issues
outpaced advancers by a margin of more than 5 to 2 on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   One sector of stocks that bucked the downward trend was energy
issues, which advanced on the expectation of higher profits for oil
producers.
   Stocks also fell in London, where the widely followed Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index dropped 34.5 points to 2,304.5.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 592.81 points, or 1.92 percent, to close at 30,245.18 in
Thursday trading. Investors were panicked by the effect that oil
prices would have on business in Japan.
   Bond prices were hit hard by the prospect of higher inflation,
which erodes the valued of fixed-income securities, and by the
possibility that interest rates won't be dropping soon. Bond prices
rise when rates decline, so higher rates depress prices.
   In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down
about $12.18 per $1,000 in face value. The bond's yield, considered
a benchmark for interest rates throughout the economy, soared to
8.46 percent from 8.35 percent late Wednesday.
   The rising prices of crude boosted prices for refined products
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The September contract
for home heating oil rose 3.50 cents to 64.69 cents a gallon, while
wholesale unleaded gasoline for September delivery jumped 3.80
cents to 68.07 cents a gallon.
   In natural gas trading, the September contract closed at $1.432
per 1,000 cubic feet, up from $1.402.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One measure of the nation's money supply rose
while another fell in the week ended July 23, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,268.5 billion from $3,273.9 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,054.9 billion from $4,052.0 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $808.0 billion from $807.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.1 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.0 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged 3,269.0 billion, a 1.0
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,055.8 billion, down 0.5 percent, while M1
rose 2.2 percent to an average of $807.9 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $383 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $523 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$654 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $123
million in the two weeks ended July 18, down from $280 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $310.8 billion in the two-week period ended
July 25, up from $307.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>KG&amp;E Urges Stockholders To Reject Tender Offer From KCPL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas Gas and Electric Co. urged
stockholders Thursday to reject a $27-per-share, $875 million
takeover offer from Kansas City Power and Light Co.
   KG&amp;E said the offer, made last month, of $857 million in cash
for its common stock and $18 million cash for three series of
preferred stock was inadequate.
   KCPL spokesman Turner White said the utility still was willing
to negotiate with KG&amp;E. But he said KCPL officials needed to study
KG&amp;E's full response before deciding on their next move.
   Federal lawsuits have been filed by both utilities and two
groups of KG&amp;E stockholders in connection with the takeover attempt.
   In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
in Washington, KG&amp;E said its board decided last Friday that the
offer was inadequate and not in the best interests of the company
and its shareholders.
   KG&amp;E did not indicate how much the offer fell short of its
perceived value of the company.
   KG&amp;E said it was not involved in merger, sale or reorganization
talks with anyone. The company said it does not believe KCPL has
met conditions needed to require KG&amp;E to provide a list of
stockholders and call a special shareholders meeting.
   The utility said it believes the offer could have adverse tax
consequences for some shareholders and significant effects on
employees, customers and the communities KG&amp;E serves.
   White said KCPL does not plan to lay off any KG&amp;E workers. He
said the utility would freeze customer rates until Jan. 1, 1993,
and has a strong record of commitment to communities in its service
area.
   KG&amp;E has excess generating capacity that KCPL would like to
utilize to postpone building new generating plants.
   KG&amp;E said its strategies for the future include a ``carefully
structured long-term plan for revenue enhancement from increased
sales of power and energy in both wholesale and retail markets.''
   The filings also said KG&amp;E was instituting further controls on
capital and operating costs that would improve earnings without
significantly increasing rates.
   KG&amp;E, headquartered in Wichita, has 1,330 employees and 254,000
customers in south central and southeast Kansas. Its 1989 revenue
was $533.5 million and it reported net profits of $47.5 million.
   KCPL, headquartered in Kansas City, Mo., employs 2,800 people
and serves 409,000 customers in western Missouri and eastern
Kansas. It made $108.6 million on $730 million in revenue in 1989.

<HEAD>Mahlmann's Problems Fuel SEC-CFTC Turf War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scandal-ridden resignation of Chicago Board
of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann has helped revive a regulatory
turf war that appeared to be winding down for lack of fuel.
   Within hours of Mahlmann's announcement Wednesday, U.S. Reps.
John D. Dingell, D-Mich., and Edward J. Markey, D-Mass, announced
an investigation into the collapse of his brokerage firm with an
emphasis on ``the adequacy of regulation and oversight in the
futures industry.''
   On Thursday, one futures industry leader countered that the
Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates securities
trading, might be more to blame than the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which regulates futures trading, for any failure to
protect customers of Mahlmann's trading company, Stotler Group Inc.
   After all, said David Vogel, chairman of the Futures Industry
Association, as a futures brokerage trade group, the SEC had
jurisdiction over Stotler's offering of shares in two commodity
investment funds that are at the center of federal allegations that
Stotler defrauded customers.
   ``If anybody wants to start throwing stones, it's a little
difficult to figure out who to throw stones at,'' said Vogel, chief
executive of the futures brokerage LIT America Inc.
   ``I don't want to say the SEC's responsible but I don't think
the CFTC's responsible at all,'' Vogel said in a telephone
interview.
   The argument signals another round in the long-running SEC-CFTC
brawl for jurisdiction over stock-index futures.
   The fall of ``Cash'' Mahlmann had nothing to do with stock-index
futures, which are contracts traded on futures exchanges that allow
investors to speculate on stock-market movements without ever
owning stocks.
   But Mahlmann's problems have much to do with critics'
perceptions that the CFTC is a lax regulator with a too-cozy
relationship with the industry it is supposed to be overseeing.
   William Hegen, deputy regional administrator of the Chicago SEC
office, has said the SEC tipped off the CFTC to an allegedly
improper transfer of $13.4 million in debt from a Stotler unit to
the parent company.
   Critics of the futures industry are likely to complain that the
CFTC should have been keeping a closer watch on Stotler, said James
McGurk, a Chicago commodities lawyer who has followed the SEC-CFTC
turf battle.
   ``The foes of the industry are going to use this,'' he said.
``The battle rages.''
   The fight had cooled recently amid waning congressional support
for a Bush-administration bill transferring jurisdiction over
stock-index futures to the SEC.
   But Stotler's collapse gives the SEC and its supporters more
ammunition, McGurk said.
   ``Now they've got an answer: `We're trying to do it better than
these guys who couldn't do it.' That's the argument that's going to
be advanced,'' he said.
   The fraud charges filed Tuesday by the CFTC were prompted by an
alleged separate attempt to inject cash into the financially ailing
Stotler. Court documents allege that Stotler Funds Inc., an
affiliate of Stotler that operates commodity investment pools,
improperly transferred more than $5 million in customer funds to
the parent company.
   The funds were supposed to be used only for investment in
commodity markets.
   Mahlmann has denied any involvement in Stotler's recent
financial decisions, saying he was spending almost all his time
running the Board of Trade.

<HEAD>Earnings of Secondary Mortgage Company Rise 11 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Freddie Mac, the secondary mortgage market
company, said Wednesday that earnings rose 11 percent in the
April-June quarter to a 20-year record.
   Earnings were $118 million, or $1.97 per share, compared with
$106 million, $1.77 per share, in the same period of 1989.
   Freddie Mac, the nickname for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp., is a congressionally chartered, shareholder-owned company
that purchases mortgages from lenders and packages many of them
into securities for resale to investors.
   Its activities account for financing of about one in eight home
purchases.
   Robert J. Quinlan, Freddie Mac's senior vice president of
control, attributed the earnings rise to increased fee income and a
widening in the spread between the interest it earns on its
mortgages and the interest it pays on its securities.
   The earnings increase came despite a rise in Freddie Mac's
provision for mortgage losses, which totaled $87 million in the
second quarter, up from $61 million a year ago.
   The company's purchase of mortgages declined 4 percent to $17.6
billion in the second quarter, compared with $18.4 billion a year
earlier.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top futures regulator denied that
a commodities firm linked to former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman
Karsten Mahlmann received special treatment in a probe of alleged
wrongdoing.
   Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Wendy Gramm told a
Senate panel Thursday night that Mahlmann, who resigned as CBOT
head amid charges of wrongdoing against a company he headed, was
not treated as ``a fellow insider by industry insiders.''
   Gramm, the wife of Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, also denied
allegations that she did polticial work for her husband and was
paid out of campaign funds, which might be a conflict of interest
if any contributors were regulated by the CFTC.
   ``I don't involve myself in my husband's campaign,'' Gramm told
the Senate Agriculture Committee, adding that she did not know who
contributors were.
   Except for those two issues, the one-hour hearing seemed more
like a testimonial dinner as senator after senator among the
handful of committee members present late Thursday praised Gramm
and her agency.
   The panel was expected to vote favorably on her renomination and
send it to the full Senate Friday or Saturday, Senate aides said.
   On Wednesday, the same day he resigned as chief of the world's
largest commodity futures exchange, Mahlmann also stepped down as
head of Stotler Group Inc., the parent company of a firm accused by
the CFTC of fraud.
   But in answer to a question by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the
committee's chairman, Gramm said neither the CBOT nor the CFTC
moved slowly against Stotler because of Mahlmann's position.
   ``Certainly this commission has never shied away from taking
action against well respected members'' of exchanges, Gramm told
the panel.
   But another committee member, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said
in a written statement that ``incidents such as the Stotler case
only serve to strengthen'' support for a Bush administration-backed
bill to strip the CFTC of authority over stock index futures and
give it to the rival Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The SEC and the Treasury Department claim control of stock index
futures, which allow investors to trade on the market's movement
through a large array of stocks without actually buying the
underlying stocks, is necessary to avoid sharp market fluctuations
like the 1987 stock market crash.
   The CFTC and the futures industry oppose the move, saying it
will impede the futures markets.
   An attempt to work out a compromise measure and include it in
the Senate farm bill ran out of time late last week.
   Bond said if a compromise to eliminate the turf battle between
the CFTC and the SEC isn't reached he could ``easily be among those
pushed into the Treasury camp.''
   But Leahy used the hearing to repeat his opposition to a
jurisdictional swap.
   ``I feel that the Treasury Department and the SEC have acted in
a highly irresponsible manner by pressing this idea in a way that
has created a bitter political stalemate'' blocking reform bills
for both the futures and securities markets,'' said Leahy.
   He conceded that a compromise would have to be worked out or a
bill reauthorizing the CFTC and giving it added anti-fraud powers
``stands no chance of becoming law in the final weeks of this
Congress.''
   Critics have questioned Gramm's numerous trips to Texas in the
two-and-a-half years as CFTC chairman.
   She said she made nine trips in 1988, nine more last year and
four so far this year.
   While she conceded accompanying him to ``some fundraising
events'' Gramm said she didn't know who contributed ``because I
don't look at the list of contributors.''
   Her husband does not accept honoraria from organizations
regulated by the CFTC to avoid the appearance of a conflict of
interest but ``I don't know if there are any regulatees of the
commission who contribute to Phil's campaign because I'm not
involved in that area,'' she said.

   Major U.S oil companies said Thursday they had
small or no operations in Kuwait and did not expect infrequent
crude shipments from the country to be disrupted because of the
invasion by neighboring Iraq.
   Texaco Inc. operates the only refinery in either country _ a
50-50 joint venture with state-owned Kuwait Oil Co.in an area known
as the neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   Texaco spokeswoman Anita Larsen said about 80 percent of the
refinery's 800 employees are Saudi nationals and are 17 American.
She said operations were continuing despite the invasion.
   Gerald Lastelic, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute
in Washington, said the Texaco-Kuwait venture is the only
U.S.-owned refinery operating in Iraq or Kuwait.
   The Texaco-Kuwait refinery produces about 135,000 barrels a day
out of three fields, Larsen said.
   Eight American oil field workers were reported missing near the
border of Kuwait and company officials suspected they had been
picked up by the invading Iraqi army, the State Department said.
The whereabouts of the eight were unknown and State Department
officials would not identify the company for whom they work.
   Among other large American oil companies, Exxon Corp., Mobil
Inc., Atlantic Richfield Co., Amoco Corp. and Chevron Corp. all
said they had no operations in Kuwait and did not rely on oil from
the Middle East nation.
   Amoco spokesman Michael Thompson in Chicago said that less than
5 percent of the oil used in its U.S. refineries was Kuwaiti crude.
   ``We have no reason to believe shipments from Kuwait will be
threatened,'' he said. ``And even if they were, a short-term loss
of Kuwait oil would not hinder our U.S. refining operations.''
   Chevron spokesman Larry Shushan said from his company's San
Francisco headquarters: ``We do from time to time of course take
oil from ports in that area. It obviously is something we are quite
concerned about because we are not going to be sending any ships
into a war zone.''
   Royal Dutch Shell Group, the European parent of Shell Oil Co.,
has one employee of a lubricants subsidiary in Kuwait, spokesman
Norman Altstedter said, but no other operations.
   He said Shell Oil imports no oil from Kuwait but 60,000 to
80,000 barrels a day from Iraq, about 6 percent of its crude oil
capacity. Short-term needs would be covered by inventories but
Altstedter said some adjustments may be needed on the company's
longer term purchasing requirements.
   Exxon issued a statement saying it has imported some oil from
Iraq to the United States in recent months. ``We are currently
evaluating our situation and taking steps to minimize any impact on
our customers worldwide,'' it said.
   Although none of the companies was directly affected, U.S. oil
company stocks rose sharply on news of the invasion, which boosted
oil prices.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading, Texaco gained $2.50 to
$66.50, Amoco rose $2.87{ to $58.25, Chevron rose $1.62{ to
$80.37{, Mobil was up $1.87{ to $67.25, Atlantic Richfield was up
$4.87{ to $135.37{, Exxon rose $1 to $53.12{ and Unocal was up
$2.12{ to $33.25.

<HEAD>Delta, Pilots Union Reach Contract Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines and the Air Line Pilots
Association agreed Thursday to a new contract that the union said
included 12.5 percent pay raises that would make the carrier's
pilots the industry's best-paid.
   The tentative agreement follows 19 months of direct negotiations
between the company and ALPA, which represents about 7,600 pilots
at Delta.
   ``We are pleased that we've been able to reach a tentative
agreement without having to resort to mediation,'' said Capt. Gary
Holcombe, chairman of the Delta pilots' Master Executive Council.
   ``This contract is industry-leading in all aspects, and one that
will both compensate Delta pilots fairly and give Delta the
resources it needs to continue to grow,'' Holcombe said.
   Delta spokesman Neil Monroe said the airline was pleased the
agreement was made, but said the company had no further comment.
   ALPA said the agreement calls for pay increases totaling 12.5
percent until the contract can be amended in 1993. A statement by
the union said it would make the Delta pilots highest paid in the
industry, however the union was not able to provide figures on
top-scale salaries.
   ALPA spokesman Rhea Nicolls said under the terms of the
agreement, the starting salary for new hires, including hourly pay
during their training, would rise from $1,800 a month to $2,500.
   The agreement also calls for the elimination of Delta's two-tier
wage system, which pays newer employees at a lower rate than
veterans, in the fourth and fifth years of a pilot's employment
beginning Sept. 1, 1992. Nicolls said such pay scales have been
common in the industry, though disliked by pilots, since airline
deregulation.
   ``This is a big breakthrough in the airline industry,'' he said.
   The contract will be formally written over the next four weeks,
and will be submitted to Delta pilots for ratification.

<HEAD>Grumman Reports 37 Percent Increase in Second Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHPAGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grumman Corporation reported Wednesday
that net income for the second quarter of the year increased 37
percent on higher revenues from its aerospace business, the company
said.
   Net income was $26.7 million, or 78 cents per share, on sales of
$1.05 billion in the April-June period. For the same period last
year, net income was $19.5 million, or 56 cents per share, on
revenue of $881.4 million.
   Both sales and profit increases were primarily related to the
F-14D fighter plane program that has higher unit prices than the
F14A Plus aircraft delivered last year, the company said.
   Renso Caporali, Grumman's newly appointed chairman, said the
favorable results indicate the company is doing a good job of
managing its business in a difficult environment for the aerospace
industry.
   In the second quarter, sales in the aerospace segment of the
company increased to $799.3 million from $618.3 million.

<HEAD>KCPL Takeover Bid Generates Court Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kansas Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday asked
a judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to force the utility to call a
special shareholder meeting to consider a takeover bid by Kansas
City Power and Light Co.
   KG&amp;E asked that the suit filed by KCPL in U.S. District Court in
Kansas City, Mo., be dismissed or transferred to Wichita's federal
court. The KCPL suit seeks a court order requiring the special
shareholders' meeting.
   KCPL launched a $27 cash per share tender offer for KG&amp;E on July
23. KG&amp;E has said it will respond to the offer, which amounts to
$875 million, by Friday.
   KG&amp;E accused KCPL of forum shopping _ trying to find a friendly
court jurisdiction in which to file suit, hoping for favorable
treatment.
   ``KCPL has reversed the roles of plaintiff and defendant in a
transparent attempt to select the forum,'' KG&amp;E said in its court
papers.
   A KG&amp;E stockholder filed a class action lawsuit in federal court
in Kansas City, Mo., Tuesday echoing the allegations made in a
similar suit filed July 26 by another stockholder.
   The Tuesday suit accuses KG&amp;E management of entrenching itself
in office and trying to thwart an auction of the company.
   KG&amp;E filed suit Tuesday in Witchita federal court challenging
the legality of the unsolicited takeover bid. The action seeks to
block KCPL's requests for a list of KG&amp;E stockholders and a special
meeting of shareholders in late August or September.
   KG&amp;E claims the takeover bid is illegal because KCPL hasn't
asked for Securities and Exchange Commission approval. Therefore,
the request for the list and shareholders' meeting is invalid, the
lawsuit claims.
   KCPL contends the acquisition doesn't require SEC approval.

<HEAD>Dollar, Oil Move Higher On Iraqi Offensive News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved higher along with oil prices
during morning trading in Tokyo Thursday on news of Iraq's
offensive into Kuwait.
   The dollar tends to rise in times of world unrest because it is
regarded as a safe haven.
   The dollar closed the morning session at 147.70 yen, up 1.05 yen
from Wednesday's close of 146.65 yen. After opening at 147.13 yen,
the currency ranged between 146.50 yen and 148.15 yen.
   Tokyo traders reported the marker price for North Sea oil, Brent
crude, was bid up to 21.30 dollars a barrel, about 30 to 40 cents
higher than in New York late Wednesday. No sellers were reported,
however.
   Currency dealers said the news that Iraqi troops crossed the
border with Kuwait set off sharp buying of the dollar, which had
been pushed to its morning lows against the yen.
   ``The dollar was bought briskly and suddenly when the news came
'' of the Iraqi troop movement, said Masakazu Kimura, a dealer with
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.
   Kimura said the dollar moved up to 147.85.-.95 yen from 146.50
yen, soon after the Iraqi action was reported at around 11:30 a.m.
local time.
   The offensive came after negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait in
their dispute over oil, borders and money collapsed Wednesday.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 255.55
points, or 0.82 percent, closing the morning session at 30,582.44.
The index lost 197.67 points on Wednesday.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 7.530 percent from Wednesday's
close of 7.480 percent. Their price stood at 85.50 points, down
from 85.72 points.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started falling with many
market players taking a wait-and-see position amid the yen's
depreciation and the weakening bond market, securities dealers said.
   ``The index lost as much as 353 points at one point, but it made
some recovery by index-related buying coupled with those buying on
a share's weakness,'' said a Nomura Securities dealer who spoke
anonymously.
