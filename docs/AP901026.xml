   On of the eve of Terry Anderson's
birthday, a community theater troupe remembered the journalist and
other Westerners held hostage in Lebanon by staging a play about
them.
   ``What we hope to accomplish with the play is arouse the
compassion of the public to voice their concern for the hostages
and urge the president to make their release a priority,'' said
Pamela Courtney, who wrote the play.
   ``We won't have an ending until Terry Anderson and the others
are released,'' she said.
   The play, ``Cry from Lebanon,'' was performed Friday night by
the Bardstown Community Theater acting troupe. It is Ms. Courtney's
first play.
   The play opened Thursday and closes Saturday night, the date of
Anderson's 43rd birthday, at the Bardstown Civic Center in this
community of 6,100 about 20 miles south of Louisville.
   Anderson was the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press when he was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The play is set in a warehouse near Beirut International
Airport. Among incidents depicted are the attempted suicide of
Thomas Sutherland, acting agricultural dean at American University,
abducted in 1985; and the murder of CIA agent William Buckley.
   Audience members are being asked to fill out postcards that ask
President Bush to make the hostages' release a priority.
   Ms. Courtney, 39, is an office manager for a restaurant and tour
company. She said she was first drawn to Anderson's story through a
magazine article written by Peggy Say, Anderson's sister, who lives
in Cadiz, Ky.
   ``I was just moved by her urgency, in her trying to get people
involved and aware of the hostage situation,'' Ms. Courtney said.
``I can imagine what it would be like if I had been trying to get
my own brother released after five years.''
   Although Anderson is featured among the 10 cast members, the
play also deals with the other hostages.
   To research the play, Ms. Courtney read books by former hostages
Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister released in 1985 after
16 months of captivity, and Jeremy Levin, the Beirut chief of U.S.
Cable News Network who escaped in 1985.
   Ms. Courtney also interviewed Weir and Mrs. Say and read
numerous newspaper and magazine accounts. She began researching the
play in January and spent about two months writing.

   House leaders scoured the Capitol for votes
Friday for a compromise budget that would reach into the pockets of
the rich, raise Medicare recipients' bills and add an extra nickel
to everyone's gasoline tax.
   Top Democrats and Republicans said they believed the House would
endorse the giant deficit-cutting package. For the rank and file,
the vote - the climax of the 101st Congress' raucous year - was a
chance to make a statement and return home in time for Election
Day.
   ``Democrats have a message of fairness to carry home, and I want
to get out of here so I can do it,'' said Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md.
   ``I'm voting against this because it's not necessary to raise
taxes on anybody, let alone everybody,'' said Rep. Richard Armey,
R-Texas.
   Sensing that support could only wane with time, House leaders
planned to bring the measure to the floor as soon as it was drafted
into legislative language - a painstaking process not expected to
be over until well after midnight.
   Just a week after the House and Senate approved separate
budgets, bargainers molded the final details of a compromise
bearing about $140 billion in new taxes and $100 billion in
spending cuts for the next five years.
   The original $250 billion size of the package shrank by about $9
billion as leaders dropped unpopular items - such as forcing state
and local government workers to join Medicare - as a tradeoff for
votes. By late afternoon, leaders said the fine-tuning was
complete.
   ``It's over,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo. ``We're done.''
   Even some conservatives who would have preferred deeper spending
cuts supported the plan, arguing that at least it took a whack at
the government's growing red ink.
   ``I don't know if it was Confucius or Garfield who said, `When
you find yourself in a hole, the first rule is quit digging,'''
said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas.
   When enacted, the bill is to be the heart of an effort to shrink
the deficit by $500 billion over the next five years. The remaining
savings are to come from restraints on defense spending and from
lower interest payments because of reduced borrowing.
   White House officials said President Bush liked the way the
package was shaping up. But he contended anew on a campaign trip in
California that the Democrats were to blame for letting the federal
deficit rise so high that he had to go back on his no-new-taxes
pledge to support the deficit-cutting effort.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department reported that the red ink
figure for fiscal 1990 - which ended Oct. 1 - reached $220.4
billion, the second highest ever.
   Passage of the budget package would ease the way for an end to
the long and troubled congressional session. On Friday, the House
and Senate also dealt with a flurry of other legislation:
   -The Senate gave final congressional passage to a $268 billion
defense bill that made modest cuts in weapons systems.
   -The Senate passed, 89-8, a comprehensive overall of the
nation's immigration laws. But the House threw the bill onto a
siding, facing an uncertain future, when it voted 235-186 not to
approve ground rules for debate.
   -A conference committee of the Interior approprations bill voted
to accept the mild anti-obscenity on arts financing in the House
bill, dropping the tougher provisions of the Senate version.
   -The House approved on a voice vote and sent to the Senate a
bill toughening sanctions against banks and savings and loans
convicted of money laundering for drug dealers.
   -The House passed and sent to the president a bill requiring
more nutrition information on food labels.
   -A House-Senate conference committee reached agreement early
Friday on a $15.5 billion foreign aid bill that, among other
things, would forgive $6.7 billion in Egyptian military
indebtedness to the United States.
   Although legislative leaders expressed confidence that the
budget deal would make it through Congress, they spent much of the
day hunting for votes among the rank and file.
   Top Democrats sought the support of the Congressional Black
Caucus. But many of its 24 lawmakers - all Democrats - said they
would oppose the budget unless the Senate took another crack at
overriding Bush's veto of the civil rights bill. The Senate fell
one vote short of override this week.
   ``Then, we could declare victory and all go home,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
   Once the bargaining was over and the deficit-reduction bill
moved through the House, it was expected to have little trouble in
the Senate.
   The package nearing completion contained a jump in the federal
gasoline tax to 14 cents a gallon from 9 cents. New levies also
would be aimed at alcohol, tobacco, furs and costly private planes.
   The ballooning costs of Medicare would be reined in by $44
billion over the next five years. Most of the reductions would be
in payments to doctors and hospitals, but $10 billion of the cuts
would come directly from the elderly and handicapped people the
program serves.
   Their monthly premiums for doctors' coverage would swell from
$28.60 this year to $46.20 in 1995, and their annual deductible
would be bumped from $75 to $100.
   For the upper-middle class, the 1.45 percent payroll tax that
supports Medicare - now deducted only up to $51,300 in earnings -
would extend to a person's first $125,000 of income.
   People earning more than $100,000 annually would lose some of
their income-tax deductions and face a phaseout of the $2,050
personal exemption.
   The income-tax rate on the 600,000 richest Americans would rise
from 28 percent to 31 percent. The top rate on the 4 million next
most well-to-do - individuals earning more than about $80,000 -
would drop from 33 percent to 31 percent.
   Cuts would also be made in programs ranging from agriculture to
student loans. But the measure did contain some provisions that
eased the pain.
   Included were $2.5 billion in tax breaks for the gas and oil
industry, compliments of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   There were also expansions of the Medicaid program, which helps
the poor afford medical care. There was new spending for home care
of low-income elderly and services for children, and new
protections against abuses by companies that sell health insurance
to senior citizens.

   Jon Grunseth, the gubernatorial
challenger in trouble over reports he swam nude with teen-age girls
in 1981, announced late Thursday he will stay in the race after
planning earlier to withdraw.
   ``I came here tonight to withdraw from this race,'' Grunseth
told about 100 supporters.
   ``But there has been just an incredible outpouring of love ...
and prayer for this family that has overwhelmed both Vicki (his
wife) and me. We are going to press forward no matter (what),'' he
said.
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier that
Grunseth would withdraw on the condition that the party's
325-member state central committee name his successor on the
ballot.
   Grunseth kept reporters and anxious supporters waiting for hours
as he huddled with advisers far past 7 p.m., the time he set for a
news conference at which he had been expected to announce his
withdrawal from the race.
   Grunseth had been running close to Democratic incumbent Rudy
Perpich before Oct. 15, when two women charged in sworn statements
that Grunseth encouraged them to join him in a nude swim in 1981,
when they were 13 and 14.
   Grunseth, 44, denied the allegation but had been under
increasing pressure from his party to quit the race. He had
consistently vowed to remain on the ballot.
   The source in the Grunseth camp said Grunseth would throw his
support to Cal Ludeman, a Tracy farmer and former state legislator
who was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986.
   Ludeman scheduled a news conference for later Thursday in the
same Bloomington hotel, but it was never held.
   The Grunseth partisan said Grunseth did not want to
automatically hand the GOP spot on the ballot to Arne Carlson, who
launched a write-in campaign on Monday after losing to Grunseth in
the Sept. 11 primary.
   Grunseth, who considers himself a moderate-conservative, had
said Carlson, a leader of the moderate wing of the party, is not
acceptable to him as the party's gubernatorial candidate.
   Elam Baer, executive director of Grunseth's campaign, met
privately with Republican U.S. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, who said during
a swing through southern Minnesota earlier in the day that
Republicans can't win the gubernatorial race with both Carlson and
Grunseth in the race against Perpich.
   ``We have a situation where two Republicans are running and one
Democrat is running,'' Boschwitz told reporters. ``Our base simply
is not big enough to cut it in half.''
   Carlson was not immediately available for comment. He was en
route to Alexandria but canceled the appearance and headed back to
the Twin Cities, said his campaign press secretary, Dave Sampsel.
   ``Until we know officially that Jon is out of the race, we don't
have much reaction,'' Sampsel said. ``Up until this point, everyone
in the Grunseth campaign has maintained rather steadfastly that Jon
was going to stay in the race until the end.''
   Ray Bohn, Perpich's press secretary, said the governor was not
immediately available. He said he did not know if Perpich would
comment after Grunseth's news conference.
   ``We're sitting 12 days away from a general election and we hope
in the next few days the Republican Party will clean up its mess
and decide who's on the ballot to face Governor Perpich,'' said
Perpich's campaign manager, John Stanoch.

   Tough anti-tax proposals in half a dozen states and a radical
school-choice scheme on Oregon's ballot have turned Election '90
into a watershed for public schools and colleges.
   Educators in California, Nebraska, Massachusetts, Utah, Oregon
and several other states are warning of school district
bankruptcies, teacher layoffs and campus closures if tax revolt
measures are approved Nov. 6.
   ``We would be on the brink of an educational meltdown,'' said
Harold Raynolds Jr., education commissioner of Massachusetts.
Voters there are about to decide on the harshest tax revolt measure
anywhere: a proposed $2 billion tax rollback. If approved, it would
be the nation's largest voter-initiated tax cut in history.
   Taxes and government waste, not schools, are the usual targets
of voter wrath in most states. But that's small comfort to school
officials, who claim they'd suffer more than most if taxing and
spending curbs are approved.
   Latest opinion polls suggest that the education forces may be
beating back anti-tax measures several states, including
Massachusetts.
   But no one is taking victory for granted.
   ``It seems like the mood of the public is sort of
anti-everything,'' said Chris Pipho, a spokesman for the Education
Commission of the States.
   ``Many voters are so blinded by an anti-tax mentality that it
doesn't matter what the tax is for,'' said Richard Novak, director
of state education policy and finance for the American Association
of State Colleges and Universities in Washington, D.C.
   And all eyes of the nation's education establishment are on
Oregon, where the most far-reaching ``choice'' scheme ever
considered would grant parents a $2,500 tax credit to send their
kids to any school, even church-related, or to teach them at home.
   The Bush administration calls ``choice'' a cornerstone of school
reform. The National Education Association, the nation's largest
teachers' union, has been leading the fight to defeat it. It says
the plan ``could well determine the fate of education for years to
come.''
   Polls have flip-flopped, but recent opinion surveys show the
choice plan trailing.
   Among key ballot contests:
   - Massachusetts Question 3, the proposed tax rollback, has
educators talking about closing college campuses, 5,000 or more
teacher layoffs, no new texts or extracurricular activities, even
bankruptcy for the poorest districts.
   ``Public education would not exist as we know it a year from
now,'' said John R. Correiro, superintendent of the impoverished
Fall River school district.
   A poll last week for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV showed 59
percent opposed to the rollback.
   - Nebraska's proposed Measure 405, the ``2 Percent Solution'' to
its proponents, would amend the constitution to limit state and
local budget increases to 2 percent. The lid could be overridden by
referendums at the local level or by a vote of 40 of the 49
legislators at the state level.
   Omaha school officials warn passage could lead to sharp program
cuts, including an end to many sports programs.
   A second proposition would repeal a year-old school finance
reform law that shifted the burden of school finance from the
property tax to the state sales and income tax.
   The contest pits educators and landowners who stand to benefit
from lower property taxes against many of the state's business
interests who insist higher sales and income taxes would put the
state at a competitive disadvantage.
   Polls suggest a close vote.
   - Colorado's proposed Amendment 1, dubbed ``Taxpayers Bill of
Rights'' by supporters, would require voter approval for state and
local tax increases and limit the rate of increase in state
spending, effective Dec. 31.
   - In addition to the ``choice'' plan, Oregon voters will weigh
Measure 5, a proposed 1.5 percent cap on property tax increases by
1995.
   - California Proposition 136 would require a two-thirds
legislative or popular majority on future tax increases.
   - In Utah, college officials warn that as many as 9,000 students
could be denied entry if voters approve a proposed repeal of the
sales tax on most food. Higher education officials figure they'd
lose $31 million, more than any other state agency.
   - Arizona's Proposition 103, the Classroom Improvement
Initiative, would require the state to boost spending by $100 per
student every year for the next 10 years. Cost estimates run from
$6 billion to $10 billion, and several GOP critics say it's just
throwing money at the state's school problems.
   - Kansas voters will decide an amendment stripping the state
board of education and the board of regents of much of their
independent authority and giving control of public and higher
education to the legislature.

   Loic Wacquant stepped into a boxing ring,
suffered a broken nose, nursed broken ribs and was KO'd - injuries
the sociologist chalks up to the pursuit of thesis material on life
in the inner city.
   The University of Chicago doctoral candidate is studying race,
class and joblessness in Chicago.
   Two years ago, he stumbled upon the Woodlawn Boys and Girls Club
and decided the South Side youth organization would provide a
perfect study field for his dissertation.
   ``I felt that both the popular and scholarly literature on
poverty and black America was full of stereotypes and caricatures
and wanted to find out what really was going on in a black
neighborhood,'' Wacquant said.
   ``I was, as they say, seduced by the world of boxing.''
   The catch, however, was a rule that only people willing to hop
into the ring could hang around the gym.
   So the 29-year-old native of Montpellier, France, spnt months
at the gym -really just a ring and a few punching bags - trying to
get the hang of boxing.
   ``People used to come to the gym just to laugh at me,'' Wacquant
said. ``I went through a procession of nicknames, from `Frenchman
with an attitude' to `bad dude' to `Busy Louie.'
   ``They call me Busy Louie because I throw a lot of punches in
the ring because I have no defense,'' he said.
   By February, the 5-foot-8{-inch, 159-pound Frenchman whose name
is pronounced loo-ee' vah-cohnt' believed he was ready for his
first fight in the Chicago Golden Gloves tournament. Three rounds
later, he wasn't so sure.
   Neither was his wife, Elizabeth, who trained with him.
   ``I thought he would be killed,'' she said.
   His trainer, D.D. Amour, said he ``retired'' Wacquant from the
ring because he has a major physical weakness for boxing - his nose
``bleeds like a faucet.''
   Wacquant said the gym, in a neighborhood of boarded up buildings
and empty lots, gives hope to neighborhood youngsters.
   ``Sports such as football, basketball and boxing are very
attractive to poor inner city youth as conspicuous examples of
success and masculine achievement,'' said Wacquant, who also is
filming a documentary on the gym.
   ``Intense bodily discipline protects from pressures and
insecurity of ghetto life,'' he added. ``It is a stable
organization where they can channel their energies.''
   The sociologist, recently named a fellow at Harvard University,
worked with the French government and a colleague in Paris to
organize an exchange of underprivileged young boxers between the
two countries.
   Wacquant's adviser, William J. Wilson, a professor of sociology
and public policy at the University of Chicago, said Wacquant was a
brilliant graduate student.
   ``He's a very, very resourceful student and extremely
creative,'' Wilson said. ``Would you get into a ring for
research?''

   Rest easy, Gothamites, Batman has a new Robin.
The Caped Crusader, who saw his sidekick blown to bits by the Joker
two years ago, has found somebody to fill the Boy Wonder's shoes -
although the footwear and the rest of his outfit are new.
   Tim Drake, who turned up at stately Wayne Manor one year ago, is
now Robin No. 3. Drake joins Bruce Wayne's alter-ego this month in
Batman comic No. 457, where he manages to rescue Batman and Vicki
Vale from the clutches of the psychotic Scarecrow.
   The third Robin, you say? Yes. The original, of course, was Dick
Grayson, who now works as a solo superhero called Nightwing. His
successor, Jason Todd, was murdered in Batman No. 428, an episode
called ``A Death in the Family.''
   Like his predecessors, Drake is an orphan taken in by
millionaire Wayne. ``I think it's part of the job description,''
said DC Comics spokeswoman Martha Thomases.
   Drake - who used his powers of deduction to figure out that
Bruce and Batman were one and the same - has been hanging around
the Batcave for the past year handling the more mundane aspects of
crime fighting.
   But the folks at DC Comics decided the time was right for a
replacement Robin, and Drake - holy sidekick, Batman! - has stepped
in.
   ``Over the last year, he has proven himself mentally, morally,
spiritually and physically capable of taking over,'' Batman editor
Dennis O'Neil said Thursday. ``Today is his rite of passage.''
   The '90s Robin also should help Batman psychologically. The
crimefighter ``would soon skew into a nasty insanity if he did not
have someone to care for, someone to maintain a link with common
humanity,'' explained O'Neil.
   Drake stakes his claim to Robin status by overcoming the
Scarecrow, who has terrorized Gotham City by mailing out drug-laced
Christmas cards that sent the recipients into homicidal frenzies.
   Afterward, Batman officially makes Tim the new Boy Wonder in a
Batcave affair attended by the ever-trustworthy butler, Alfred. The
new Robin gets a new outfit as well, one designed (in the comics)
by Batman and approved (in real life) by ``Batman'' movie director
Tim Burton.
   Did anybody say sequel?
   Due to the demise of his last partner, Batman has come up with
new Robin-wear that is heavy on safety. Gone is Robin's old yellow
cape; in its place is a black model fashioned from bullet-resistant
Kevlar. The same material is used for the shirt, which has an
armored collar.
   The utility belt is still there, albeit a color-coordinated
version that looks like it was designed by Perry Ellis rather than
Bruce Wayne. A new ``R'' logo appears on his outfit; his shoes are
no longer green boots, but fire-resistant and bullet-proof black
numbers.
   The net result: Robin looks sharp, and Batman should sleep
easier. ``I think Batman psychologically felt that to put a new kid
on the firing line he needed a new, safer costume,'' said DC editor
Dan Rapser.

<TEXT>
   Thomas Campbell told his family that being
held hostage for 14 hours at the Camp Hill State Prison one year
ago was more torturous than hand-to-hand combat in Vietnam.
   In Vietnam, Campbell could defend himself.
   Campbell was one of 18 prison employees taken hostage by inmates
during the uprising on Oct. 25-27, 1989, in which 123 people were
injured.
   Guards say they warned before the riot that trouble was brewing
and complain that little has been done since then to improve the
situation.
   Inmates used a nail-studded board to beat Campbell on his back
and legs. They pounded his body with a metal baseball bat, stabbed
him with a screwdriver, sliced open the back of his left hand and
hit him between the eyes with a piece of lumber.
   When he was finally rescued, the 42-year-old guard had about 80
puncture wounds in his back, seven stab wounds in his left side and
knees that ``looked like basketballs,'' his mother said.
   ``I went in to him that morning, he was in intensive care, and I
didn't even recognize him, his face was so swollen,'' said his
mother, Barbara Campbell. ``I said, `Honey you're going to be all
right, look what you've been through.'
   ``He said, `Mom, this was worse than Vietnam.' ''
   Campbell spent 11 days in a hospital, and several months in
therapy and at-home rehabilitation. He is expected to return to
work Nov. 5.
   It has cost the state millions of dollars to begin repairs at
the medium-security prison, shift inmates temporarily from ruined
cellblocks to the federal prison system and pay overtime.
   Cumberland County District Attorney Michael Eakin said more than
a quarter of his staff's time and money has gone to prosecute the
estimated 200 inmates allegedly involved in the riots. The prison
is in Cumberland County, about five miles from the state capital,
Harrisburg.
   ``It's a logistical can of worms and a burden on the attorneys
in the office and the clerical staff,'' Eakin said. ``It's going to
end up costing the county over a million dollars.''
   Gubernatorial candidate Barbara Hafer and other Republicans have
tried to turn the riot into a factor against Gov. Robert P. Casey's
bid for re-election in November. They point to unrepaired damage
and to guards' repeated warnings that it could happen again.
   Two cell blocks, the main dining hall, gymnasium, greenhouse and
auditorium are still gutted and only half of the education building
is usable.
   Guards say the prison is woefully understaffed, forcing them to
pull 12-hour shifts, sometimes six days a week. Officials say 50 to
70 guards and staff have not returned to work since the riots.
   ``Nothing's changed. It's gotten worse,'' said Daniel Murdock, a
guard with 11 years' experience. He said officials don't listen to
what guards have to say.
   Before the riots, 2,700 inmates were housed at the prison, which
was designed to hold 1,826, said John Palakovich, Camp Hill prison
spokesman. The riot left housing only for 1,537 prisoners but 2,193
inmates are still there.
   More than 500 remain in 31 federal prisons across the country,
at a cost to the state of about $25,700 each day. Officials say
they are ready to bring them back. At one point, 806 inmates had
been farmed out to the federal system.
   Administrators say things have improved.
   Casey spokesman Vincent Carocci said the administration
responded adeptly by establishing a commission to investigate the
riots. The commission's 57-page report included several key
recommendations, which officials say have already begun. The prison
administration also was replaced.
   Prison officials point to a new, $6.8 million concrete and steel
modular cell unit that can house 256 inmates, new security fences
inside the prison and steel mesh to cover cell doors. They say the
hiring of more guards has been approved and prison expansion is a
priority.
   Department of Corrections spokesman Ben Livingood said the
damaged buildings should be repaired by spring and four additional
maximum-security housing units should be constructed in about nine
months.

   The Pentagon is sending additional troops to
Saudi Arabia partly to counter a recent hardening of Iraq's
defenses in occupied Kuwait, officials say.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday that more American
GIs - possibly as many as 100,000 - will be shipped to the Saudi
desert to join the 220,000 U.S. forces already in the Persian Gulf
area following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   He said no final decision has been made on which additional
units will be sent.
   Cheney and other officials said the troop addition does not
signal a switch in U.S. policy from defending against a possible
Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia to laying the groundwork for an
offensive against Iraq.
   Cheney said the extra troops, some of which may come from U.S.
bases in Germany that are scheduled to close, will give U.S.
military authorities more leverage in dealing with Iraq's huge
army, which includes an estimated 3,500 tanks in Kuwait.
   ``Our decision to add forces results from Iraq's almost doubling
of forces in Kuwait and southern Iraq from approximately 265,000 in
early September to about 430,000 today,'' the Pentagon said in a
statement released after Cheney disclosed the decision in
television interviews.
   Iraqi President ``Saddam Hussein continues to fortify his
positions in Kuwait and southern Iraq and continues to accumulate
significant forces that could, conceivably, go south,'' the
statement said.
   Cheney also said the Pentagon was planning to send fresh troops
to the Saudi desert to replace units due for rotation back to their
home stations. He said final decisions were pending on which units
to rotate and in what order.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said the U.S. force in Saudi Arabia appeared
ill-fitted for the Bush administration's stated aims.
   ``It's the wrong size force,'' the Wisconsin Democrat said.
``It's too big to stay there and too small to attack.''
   Echoing Cheney's remarks, CIA Director William Webster said
Thursday that Saddam was greatly improving the quality of his
defenses in Kuwait, making any U.S. offensive operation more
problematic and costly.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters the Iraqi
occupation forces were fortifying their positions by digging
anti-tank ditches, laying mines and building berms, or earthen
walls, to protect and hide their armor. He said they also were
building roads to allow for quick reinforcements.
   ``While the Iraqis have dug in, that is an indication to our
analysts not that they have lost the capability to go on the
offensive but rather that they don't show any sign of letting go of
Kuwait,'' Williams said.
   Cheney stressed that Bush has not ordered him to prepare for an
offensive action against Iraq, but he noted that the president has
not ruled out the use of force.
   The Pentagon chief said U.S. forces are in the gulf area to
deter Saddam from invading Saudi Arabia, to defend the Saudi
kingdom in the event of an attack and to enforce United Nations
sanctions against Iraq.
   ``We want to have the capability for the president to make the
decision to use other options should that become necessary in
response to a provocation, for example,'' Cheney said.
   At another point, he said, ``For a number of reasons I would
expect a continuing flow of forces to the gulf in the period
ahead.''
   Asked whether as many as 100,000 more troops might be sent, the
secretary said: ``It's conceivable that we'll end up with that big
an increase.''
   Williams indicated that Cheney was considering transferring as
many as 50,000 troops from Germany to Saudi Arabia, but that plans
were incomplete.
   The Saudi ambassador, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan, said after a
late afternoon meeting Thursday with senior State Department
officials, ``The issue of peace or war is in the hands of Saddam
Hussein.''
   Asked why the United States was sending more troops, the
ambassador replied, ``It just means we will not take any chances.''

   When the Senate Appropriations Committee wrote
the Energy Department spending bills, Chairman Robert Byrd got $10
million for Alzheimer's disease research at West Virginia
University, in his home state.
   The committee's top Republican, Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon,
negotiated $12.5 million for a neurosensory research center at
Oregon Health Sciences University.
   In the House, Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten,
D-Miss., persuaded colleagues to approve $2.5 million for computer
research atJackson State University. Top committee Republican
Silvio Conte of Massachusetts got $10 million for catalysis-based
energy research at Boston College.
   The bill was laden with additional tens of millions of dollars
for research projects in other panel members' home states.
   None of the spending was sought by the Bush administration or
authorized by House committees with jurisdiction over scientific
research. None of the House members' projects were in the Senate
bill, nor were any of the senators' projects in the House measure.
   But when the two different versions were merged in a conference
committee, all of the projects survived intact - despite $700
million in cuts from other energy and water programs to meet
deficit-reduction goals.
   ``Frankly, what we are doing is ignoring the science, the
judgments of the scientists, and we are depending upon the
judgments of the politicians,'' said Rep. Don Ritter, R-Pa., a
former research engineer.
   Rep. Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, the top Republican on the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee, tried in vain last
week to stop ``the unauthorized pork barrel projects.''
   Not a chance. The House voted against him nearly 3-1. ``The word
on the floor,'' he said, was ``you better be with us on this, or
we're going to take a look at your projects, too.''
   Congress' struggle to find $20 billion in spending cuts this
year as a part of a five-year, $500 billion deficit-reduction plan
is not stopping lawmakers from taking care of their home districts.
   ``All politics is local,'' former House Speaker Thomas P.
O'Neill often said. And with an election coming up Nov. 6,
lawmakers are well aware their job security hangs as much on
bringing home the bacon as on their voting records.
   ``I'm over outrage; I'm into nausea,'' said Walker. ``The fact
is that when we are allocating money, it is not based upon merit
other than the people who are sitting in the room divvying up the
money.''
   But members of the appropriations committees show no remorse in
exercising their power to fund projects back home.
   ``This is research that has to be done,'' said Rep. John Myers,
of Indiana, the top Republican on the House Appropriations
subcommittee on energy and water projects. He got $4.8 million for
a new technology center at Indiana State University.
   ``Maybe they are located in some of the districts of members,
but we know more about them there,'' Myers said.
   Lawmakers don't have to be on the appropriations committee to
get money for the folks back home, though. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., this week trumpeted Senate approval of $32.5
million for five recreational and cultural projects in New York,
including construction of the Women's Rights Park in Seneca Falls.
   The appropriations process often ends up in a public tussle.
This week, Virginia lawmakers told constituents that a House-passed
bill means a Newport News, Va., shipyard will win a coveted
contract to build the $1.7 billion SSN-21 Seawolf submarine.
   ``We have won the struggle,'' declared Rep. Herbert H. Bateman,
R-Va.
   Not so fast, said lawmakers from Connecticut. Rather, they said,
the bill requires Newport News to compete with the General Dynamics
Corp. submarine construction yard in Groton, Conn.
   A congressional staffer familiar with the legislation said
General Dynamics still could win the contract.
   Byrd, a 32-year Senate veteran, gave up the more prestigious
majority leader's job two years ago to head the Appropriations
Committee, ``where I can best serve the people of my state.''
   ``My proposals for West Virginia come under the sharpest
scrutiny, more so because I'm the chairman,'' Byrd said Thursday.
``This nation must invest in its infrastructure, its research and
its people .... My efforts to strengthen West Virginia's economic
bases reflect that belief.''

<HEAD>New `Masked Ball' Production Stars Pavarotti, Millo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Will stand for PMs.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``The Masked Ball'' is back in Stockholm at the
Metropolitan Opera and Luciano Pavarotti and Aprile Millo are
starring in the new production.
   They were in splendid voice and Juan Pons, singing as the
husband, vocally held up his side of the triangle, when the new
production premiered on Thursday night.
   Verdi set ``The Masked Ball'' in 1792 Stockholm but Italian
censors rejected that and he moved it to Boston. The production
that this one replaces, last seen at the Met in the 1982-82 season,
had Scene 1 in what looked like a spartan, bare wood courtroom. The
sumptuousness of a throne room is more fun for an audience and the
music Pavarotti sings, and the way he sang it Thursday, are
suitable for a king.
   Pavarotti sang with the beauty that has made him a worldwide
star. He may have started singing Verdi too soon in the mid-1970s
but now he's right for it and sounding wonderful.
   Miss Millo is a real Verdi soprano, with the right roundness of
voice, confidence, strong projection and lovely, youthful-sounding
top notes.
   James Levine conducted sensitively, keeping orchestra volume low
during thought-filled arias.
   Harolyn Blackwell sang effectively - we especially like her
light coloratura singing - as the king's page. She must have been
frustrated by opening night mishaps - her hat fell off four times
and she dropped a cloth draped over her arm - but she carried on
with aplomb.
   Elena Obraztsova sang Ulrica, the fortune teller, with deep
Slavic-sounding chest tones, consistant with the character.
   Piero Faggioni did set, costume and lighting design. Pavarotti
dons a royal cape in Act 1 with a train that extends down four
stairsteps. His other capes and jackets were bordered in gold. Miss
Millo's first costume was a striking, flamboyant gown and big
feathered hat. Even in disgrace with her husband at home, she
wasn't shabby.
   There is wonderful music in ``A Masked Ball,'' duets, ensembles
and choruses, but Verdi lavished even more in other operas.
   Though we like the Swedish court better than Boston, there are
quibbles about this production. On Act 2, steam puffed out, maybe
meant to be clouds, but it was distracting. In Act 3, it puffed up
behind and above interior rooms.
   A ceiling with a row of skylight windows was always present,
looking especially odd outdoors in Act 2. Act 2 looked overly
Wagnerian, with steps down mountains on each side and a cut between
mountains in the center. Some of the staging, with walkways above
walkways and lots of people onstage, was in the massive Zeffirelli
style.
   This production does solve the king's death scene difficulties
by carrying him from the floor to his throne during the time when
tenors in previous productions have seemed to expire then rouse to
sing some more.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bloodshed in Lebanon Hardly Attracts U.S.
Attention</HEAD>

   The slaying of 19 Palestinian Arabs during a
riot in Jerusalem brought the United States into open conflict with
Israel, its closest ally in the Middle East.
   But next door, in Lebanon, the death toll is far greater, and
the Bush administration is keeping its head down.
   There is some discussion of the country's plight in United
Nations corridors. And the State Department this week implicitly
criticized Syria for not curbing the bloodshed.
   But no one is demanding a U.N. inquiry. And the Bush
administration is not blaming anyone publicly for the violence.
   By contrast, the United States was the chief sponsor of the
resolution approved Oct. 12 by the U.N. Security Council that
condemned Israel for the shooting deaths of the 19 Palestinians
during a riot on the Temple Mount four days earlier.
   The United States voted against Israel again Wednesday for
refusing to admit U.N. investigators.
   One of the reasons Israeli leaders gave for rejecting the U.N.
investigation - despite a plea from President Bush - was that the
Security Council had already reached its conclusions, finding
Israel at fault for the slayings.
   When it comes to Lebanon, however, the administration is not
assessing blame for the nearly daily slayings that have torn the
country apart.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beirut was closed last September. Ambassador
John McCarthy and his staff were recalled for their safety.
   Lacking an official U.S. presence, the State Department says it
is unable to determine who is responsible for particular acts of
violence.
   The killings increased after Gen. Michel Aoun, the last major
Christian holdout against Syrian influence over Lebanon, gave up
the fight two weeks ago.
   ``We have seen the many press reports of atrocities carried out
in East Beirut since the surrender of General Aoun,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   She added: ``If those reports are true, whoever is responsible
the United States would condemn them in the strongest terms.''
   The administration had urged Aoun to end his resistance. He has
taken refge in the French embassy.
   ``We have told the Syrians they have a special responsibility,
given their control over parts of Lebanon, to ensure that such
abuses do not take place in areas under their control,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.
   Syria, which has influence over the Lebanese government headed
by President Elias Hrawi, is a key Arab ally of the United States
in its campaign against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. About 4,000
Syrian troops are in Saudi Arabia to help defend the kingdom
against Iraqi attack.
   Yet Syria remains on the State Department's list of countries
that promote terrorism.
   When Secretary of State James A. Baker III called on President
Hafez Assad last month in Damascus he made a point of the U.S.
allegations.
   Raymond Tanter, a University of Michigan professor who served on
the National Security Council at the outset of the Reagan
administration, commends Bush for his response to Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   Yet Tanter, who has just written a book titled ``Who's at the
Helm: Lessons of Lebanon,'' accuses the administration of
exhibiting benign neglect when Syria increased its troops in Beirut
this month.
   ``Why would Bush deploy over 200,000 troops, building up an
international coalition, impose an economic blockade and embargo,
and threaten military action against Saddam Hussein of Iraq while
ignoring the takeover of Lebanon by Hafez Assad of Syria?'' Tanter
asked Thursday.
   The answer, he said in a telephone interview, is simple.
   ``Although there is firm evidence linking Assad to all manner of
terrorist acts, including the downing of Pan Am 103, it is more
important to focus attention on Saddam's rape of Kuwait and to hold
together the coalition against him than it is to aid Lebanon,''
Tanter said.
   However, he said, this approach could send the wrong signal to
Damascus, encouraging Assad to challenge Israel or to move against
Jordan.
   A Palestinian group with strong ties to Syria, the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, is suspected in
the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in which 270 people perished.
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shara said during a news
conference with Baker there was no hard evidence the Popular Front
was responsible for the tragedy. He said Syria condemned terrorism
in all its forms.

   Iraqi occupation forces are pulling
Kuwaiti license plates off cars and refusing gasoline to owners who
won't change them to new, ``Kuwait-Iraq'' plates, Kuwaitis fleeing
their country say.
   Traffic has fallen off sharply at this dusty border post, with
only 16 cars crossing into Saudi Arabia in a five-hour period
compared to up to 300 a day in recent days, a senior Saudi official
told reporters Thursday.
   One Kuwaiti at the border, who gave only his first name Falah,
said Iraqi soldiers stopping cars at checkpoints were removing
plates and confiscating identity cards.
   ``They are arresting our young men and beating them,'' he said.
``Every day, all over the place, they have checkpoints.''
   He stood under a concrete canopy as Saudi border police searched
his car, even using a search dog to sniff out the trunk. The
Saudis, and other Persian Gulf nations, have been searching
incoming travelers closely for weapons and other materials that
might be used in Iraqi-inspired terrorism.
   But the senior official, who spoke on condition of not being
named, said there had been no arrests of Iraqi spies and no
seizures of prohibited goods at the border.
   Nearby, a tent village originally set up to handle the flood of
fleeing Kuwaitis and foreigners from Kuwait stood almost empty, the
tents' canvas doors flapping in the hot desert wind. Only 20 people
were using the tents.
   Many arriving Kuwaitis have no identity papers. They are given a
certificate that will help them with formalities in Saudi Arabia
such as checking into hotels.
   Kuwaitis confirmed that gasoline was only being provided to cars
with the new ``Kuwait-Iraq'' plates. The senior Saudi official said
the Iraqi order limiting gasoline supplies appeared to be a factor
in the decline in numbers of cars crossing the border.
   Gasoline rationing went into effect Tuesday. Private cars are
allowed 8 gallons a week and trucks, 24 gallons.
   The Kuwaitis said that long lines of cars have formed at the
three centers set up in Kuwait to allow them to convert their
plates.
   Kuwaiti officials in exile say such moves are designed to
obliterate the notion of Kuwaiti nationality. Tens of thousands of
Iraqis are reportedly being settled in Kuwait in an attempt to
change the demographic balance there.

   Author Salman Rushdie, in hiding since Ayatollah
Khomeini ordered his execution for writing ``The Satanic Verses,''
will appear on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' Sunday.
   CBS officials said the interview with Mike Wallace took place at
a secret location. Rushdie was escorted there by police from
England's Scotland Yard.
   The author went into hiding in 1989 after Khomeini ordered him
killed. The late Iranian leader said the ``The Satanic Verses''
denigrated Moslems.
   Rushdie told Wallace he did not intend to insult Moslems.
   ``I'm not this kind of creature with horns and a tail that I've
been painted,'' Rushdie said.
   The 43-year-old author said he remains optimistic he can
eventually reconcile with the Moslem world. But Rajei-Khorrasani,
an Iranian Parliament leader, told Wallace the death sentence can
never be lifted.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Dennis Barrie, acquitted of obscenity charges
for showing photographer Robert Mappletorpe's controversial photos,
says the controversy may put his museum out of business.
   Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and Barrie, its director,
were acquitted this month of obscenity charges stemming from an
exhibit of of Mapplethorpe's photos, some of which showed nudity
and graphic sexual behavior.
   Barrie, in New York on Thursday to accept a Hugh M. Hefner First
Amendment Award from the Playboy Foundation, said the dispute has
crippled the museum's fund-raising efforts.
   ``We quite honestly don't know if we will exist in a year or
two,'' he said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Keenen Ivory Wayans, the creative force behind
the hit comedy ``In Living Color,'' says he never worried that
white people wouldn't get the jokes, but he was surprised that so
many like the show.
   ``I knew there wouldn't be a problem with white people getting
it, especially urban, hipper folks,'' said Wayans, who created the
show and is one of its actors and writers. ``I was really concerned
about the folks in the outskirts.''
   But the fact that ``so many people get it ... gives validity to
my theory that people aren't color-conscious in their viewing
habits. They're content-conscious,'' he said in the Oct. 26 issue
of USA Weekend.
   The show, which won an Emmy during its first season, includes
such skits as ``Homeboy Shopping Network,'' in which two
chain-bedecked black men sell off luxury cars in a stadium parking
lot while the vehicle owners watch a baseball game.
   It also features wicked impersonations of such black celebrities
as Mike Tyson, Arsenio Hall and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
   Wayans acknowledges that white people couldn't get away with
such jokes.
   ``It's the old rule, you do have the right to have fun with your
own, but not talk about the other guy,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Guns N' Roses has filed a $2 million lawsuit
against K mart Corp. for alleged unauthorized use of the rock
band's picture and name in an advertisement for a toy drum set.
   The band members ``suffered damage to their reputation, loss of
good will, mental anguish resulting from the use of the
advertisement without their consent,'' acording to the Superior
Court lawsuit filed Wednesday.
   The lawsuit, filed by attorney Kevin F. Ruf, seeks $1 million in
special damages and $1 million in general damages. It alleges
commercial invasion of privacy, misappropriation of the band's
name, unfair competition and trademark infringement.
   K mart's corporate offices in Troy, Mich., were closed late
Thursday and no one was available to comment on the lawsuit, said a
security guard who answered the phone.

   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - The ex-wife of Revlon founder Charles

seawall at her $3 million estate.
   Johanna ``Ancky'' Johnson has been ordered to pay $193,000 or
Palm Beach may begin foreclosure proceedings, said Town Attorney
John Randolph. Officials placed a lien on her home last June.
   Mrs. Johnson called the fine and lien ridiculous and said her
son John Revson has been working with engineers to arrange repairs.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actor Edward Woodward is returning to
television after a heart attack and exhaustion associated with
working on the old show ``The Equalizer.''
   When he quit two years ago, Woodward said he wouldn't be back in
another TV series, but he says he got restless and liked the role
offered him in the new CBS show ``Over My Dead Body.''
   ``I did not want to do another television series, but it had
nothing to do with the heart attack, although that was a terrifying
experience,'' Woodward said recently.
   ``No, the fact is, I am not a television-series animal. I get
restless quickly and I have always liked playing different roles
constantly.''
   In ``Over My Dead Body,'' Woodward plays a mystery novelist who
teams up with a young, female newspaper writer to solve crimes.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evander Holyfield knocked Buster Douglas
unconscious with a right to the jaw in the third round and became
the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world Thursday night.
   The stunning finish ended the reign of Douglas, which began when
he shocked the sports world with a 10th-round knockout of Mike
Tyson last Feb. 11.
   Douglas had just thrown a right uppercut that missed when
Holyfield crashed home a right that dropped the 246-pound champion
flat on his back at 1:10 of the third round. Douglas was counted
out by the referee, and remained on the canvas for several seconds
before being helped to a stool where he was examined by a ringside
physician.
   Douglas went into the ring a 7-5 underdog, making him the 11th
heavyweight champion to be an underdog when defending a title. He
also became the 17th heavyweight champion to lose the title in his
first defense.
   Holyfield now has a 25-0 record with 21 knockouts. Douglas is
30-5-1 with 20 knockouts.

   Federal health authorities, reporting 45
hospitalizations and two deaths in police training in Massachusetts
and firefighter fitness tests in New York, called for a balance
between training and safety.
   In a report Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control didn't
criticize the programs or the public safety officials involved. But
the Atlanta-based agency did warn that the programs can be
dangerous.
   ``The need for physical performance testing must be balanced
carefully with the safety of persons participating,'' the CDC
cautioned.
   Massachusetts' cases came in a highly publicized episode in
September 1988, when 13 of 50 trainees from local police
departments became ill and were hospitalized during a 14-week
``mental stress'' and physical training program at a
state-sponsored police academy. One trainee died.
   In New York City, 32 out of 16,506 firefighter candidates were
hospitalized between May 1988 and December 1989 after fitness tests
designed to simulate the rigors of firefighting. Again, one died.
   In both locations, symptoms included back pains, nausea and
either dark or decreased urine. Four New York firefighter
candidates and six Massachusetts police recruits required kidney
dialysis, the CDC said.
   The cases are characterized as exercise-related breakdowns in
muscle fiber, accompanied by acute kidney impairment. In both
locations, health investigators found those most likely to become
ill were recruits not accustomed to vigorous exercise, the CDC
said.
   Breakdown in muscle tissue ``is a natural consequence of
vigorous physical activity,'' including athletics and military
work. But in persons unaccustomed to regular exercise, it can be
extensive, and kidney impairment can also occur, the CDC said.
   In New York, the fire fitness test was offered over a two- to
three-month period every four years. In 1988-89, it was repeatedly
suspended for health concerns.
   The timed test lasted only a few minutes and included the
performance of firefighting tasks while wearing heavy equipment.
After the illnesses, the city Department of Health recommended that
the test be modified before it is given again.
   The Massachusetts training program included strenuous exercise
under hot conditions and limited water availability. It
subsequently was revised and the state attorney general urged an
overhaul of the agency responsible.

<HEAD>EC Planned Ban on Imports of U.S. Meat Attacked</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan by the European Community to ban
imports of U.S. meat on grounds it is produced under unsanitary
conditions is seen by industry and Agriculture Department officials
as a flagrant example of a non-tariff trade restriction.
   Besides infuriating U.S. officials, the EC plan puts a further
snarl in Uruguay Round negotiations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, which are supposed to conclude by the end of the
year.
   One of the goals of the GATT talks is to bring some kind of
order to international health standards for food and agricultural
products.
   But the 12-nation EC, a major player in the GATT talks, plans to
announce soon a ban on imports of U.S. pork, beginning on Oct. 31,
and beef imports by the end of the year.
   The plan was outlined by Ray MacSharry, EC commissioner, in a
letter this week to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   MacSharry said the long-sweltering issue over U.S. meat products
had not been resolved to the satisfaction of the community.
   Further, he said, many of the sanitary problems noted by EC
authorities still exist in U.S. hog-slaughter plants, including
``insufficient general hygiene and veterinary control, insufficient
post-mortem inspections and trichinella treatment or inspection.''
   MacSharry continued: ``I am afraid that these results show that
no matter how much patience and goodwill is shown on the part of
the (EC) there remains an absence of commitment on the part of the
U.S. authorities concerning establishments producing fresh meat for
the community.''
   Yeutter, who was in South America this week, replied in a
statement issued by his office that the EC's intention to ban meat
imports was an ``absurd'' idea.
   A 1989 restriction on imports of U.S. beef products because of
potential hormone contamination was eased, but not until the United
States had countered with high tariffs on imports of EC
agricultural products.
   Yeutter said USDA has been working with the EC the past two
years to make regulatory requirements and technical methods
acceptable to both sides.
   ``While we and the U.S. meat industry do not agree with the EC's
allegations, many U.S. companies have made changes within their
plants to comply with the EC requirements, even though these
changes do not result in a superior or safer product,'' he said.
   Yeutter added, ``It is exasperating that the EC has ignored the
attempts by the U.S. meat industry to comply with its requirements
and has taken this action to stop U.S. meat exports into the EC.''
   Meat makes up a relatively small part of the total U.S.
agricultural exports to the EC, which last year totaled about $6.57
billion, according to Agriculture Department trade statistics. Meat
and meat products were put at $147.7 million, or about 2 percent of
the total.
   However, Europe is an important market for ``variety'' meats,
the edible offals such as livers, tongues and other organs not in
great demand among American consumers.
   According to Yeutter and others close to the GATT talks,
agreements are being sought ``to ensure that sanitary and
phytosanitary rules are used for legitimate food safety purposes,
not to build trade barriers.''
   Current GATT rules state that the 97 member countries of the
agreement have the right to adopt any measure considered necessary
to protect human, animal or plant life or health.
   But the rules are so vague that many countries use ``health
requirements'' to shut out certain imports when they choose to do
so.
   ``This is an artificial trade barrier, not a food safety
issue,'' said Mike Wehler, president of the National Pork Producers
Council.
   ``This is one more example of the EC's fortress mentality when
it comes to trade barriers that protect its pork industry,'' he
said.
   Under procedures being developed during the GATT talks, a
country would be able to challenge another's claim that
health-related import regulations were necessary to protect
domestic human or plant life or health. The challenge then would be
settled within the GATT framework.
   Each nation would still be able to set its own food safety
standards based on its definition of acceptable risks. However,
international standards would serve as a reference for settling a
dispute under GATT proceedings.
   The idea is to formulate food safety standards based on
scientific evidence and science, and to eliminate their use as
trade barriers, according to a USDA background report.
   Three international scientific organizations would serve as the
basis or initial reference point for settling disputes within the
GATT:
   -Codex Alimentarius Commission, established in 1963, with a
membership of 135 countries. It is concerned with protecting the
health of consumers, ensuring fair practices in food trade, and
promoting the coordination of food standards.
   -International Office of Epizootics, with 106 members. It is
concerned with health and sanitary requirements for animal imports
and exports. It was founded in 1924 and is the oldest international
veterinary organization.
   -International Plant Protection Conference, with 88 member
countries. It develops plant quarantine requirements and other
measures to prevent the spread of plant pests and diseases from
country to country. It was formed in the 1950s and works mainly
with regional groups such as the North American Plant Protection
Organization.

   Forty-one students were injured Thursday
when gymnasium bleachers collapsed just after a high school
assembly ended.
   The bleachers gave way about 11 a.m. at St. Mark's High School
as students were being dismissed from an anti-drug rally, state
police said.
   The bleachers, of 12 rows each, are in sections lining both
sides of the gym. Nine of 12 rows of one section collapsed.
   The injured students were treated at two area hospitals and
released. John LaForgia, spokesman for the Medical Center of
Delaware, said the most serious injury was a concussion.
   ``There were a lot of bumps and bruises and a couple of sprains.
One person had broken teeth,'' LaForgia said.
   The bleachers have been in the school since it opened in
September 1969, Principal Ronald R. Russo said.
   He said the bleachers are maintained by the school's maintenance
workers. He did not know when they were last inspected.
   He said none of the bleachers will be used until all are
inspected by a structural engineer. Russo said he plans to have the
manufacturer inspect the damage and may schedule an independent
examination. The school's insurance company was also expected to
inspect the damage.

<HEAD>Bulgaria Faced With New Dilemna: Unsafe Nuke Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TEDDIE WEYR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International experts say Bulgaria's only
nuclear power complex is dangerously understaffed due to a brain
drain, but shutting it down could cripple the country's economy.
   The dilemma extends across Eastern Europe, where nuclear plants
run by the Soviet Union's former allies have raised concern about
their design and operation. The German government plans to close
five Soviet-built reactors in what once was East Germany by
December.
   The five plants at Bulgaria's Kozlodui nuclear complex, on the
Danube River bordering Romania, generate 30 percent of the
country's electricity.
   But Ferdinand Franzen of the Vienna-based International Atomic
Energy Agency said Thursday that the facility was in a ``critical
phase,'' and that the seriousness of the problem ``should not be
underestimated.''
   Franzen said there was a ``dramatic brain drain'' of qualified
technicians that endangered a sixth reactor under construction, and
could lead to a possible shutdown of the fifth unit.
   Franzen spoke to the Bulgarian news agency BTA after the IAEA
team he led finished a two-week review of conditions at Kozlodui,
80 miles northeast of the capital Sofia.
   The fifth and sixth reactors at the complex are the same design
as the reactor that exploded at Chernobyl in April 1986. The Soviet
Union has decided to stop building those reactors and is closing
Chernobyl.
   Earlier this month, workers at Kozlodui said the sixth reactor
was plagued with safety violations and would explode if started up.
   Parliamentarian Krassen Stanchev said the agency's report
creates a dilemna for Bulgaria.
   A shutdown would force the government either to close
industries, risking mass unemployment, or add electricity to the
long list of food and household items that are rationed to
consumers, he said.
   ``We need the nuclear station at any price, but the additional
measures to improve the safety are very expensive for us,'' said
Stanchev, an opposition member and head of the Environmental
Commission in Bulgaria's Parliament.
   Stanchev said sufficient safety measures would cost an extra
$400 million. Without Western aid they would be impossible, he
said, in an interview Wednesday in Vienna, where he was attending a
conference on the environment.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov acknowledged there was a shortage of
personnel at the plant, but said the facility offers a way out of
Bulgaria's energy crisis.
   Bulgaria already is short of energy as a result of the Persian
Gulf crisis, a shortfall in Soviet supplies and its own economic
ills.
   Energy shortages already have led to shutdowns of electric power
in Sofia and other parts of Bulgaria, where staple food items, gas
and heating oil are being rationed.
   The economic crisis has led to renewed protests against the
ruling Socialist Party, which was the Communist Party until it
changed its name last year.
   Other former East bloc countries also rely heavily on nuclear
energy. It accounts for more than 27 percent of Czechoslovakia's
electricty and nearly 50 percent of Hungary's, according to 1989
statistics published by the IAEA.
   An IAEA team visiting Romania earlier this month found poor
construction quality and lackadaisacal attitudes among workers at
the Cernavoda plant, under construction there. The Western-designed
plant would be Romania's first.
   Czechoslovakia has acknowledged that one of its two nuclear
reactors does not meet world safety standards.
   Eastern Europe's energy crisis is not likely to be overcome
soon. The Soviet Union is to begin demanding hard currency for its
oil exports starting Jan. 1. Higher world prices sparked by the
Persian Gulf crisis will add to the burden.
   Growing environmental consciousness rules out further
development of such heavy polluters as brown coal, another possible
source of electricity.

<HEAD>How to Put Saddam `Back in His Box'?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Middle East won't be safe until Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is contained, says CIA Director William
Webster.
   The Bush administration is reluctant to see Saddam remain in
power regardless of what happens in Kuwait, Webster suggested
Thursday.
   ``Can you put him back in his box?'' he asked.
   Officials have ``no real confidence that the area will ever be
secure again as long as he (Saddam) is still there'' unless he is
``disassociated'' from his weapons, Webster said. A regional
peacekeeping force would be the best way to east tensions in the
long term, he said.
   Saddam has amassed one of the largest military machines in the
world. He also possesses chemical weapons and reportedly is
developing nuclear weapons. U.S. officials estimate he has 400,000
troops in or around Kuwait, which he invaded Aug. 2.
   Because of Saddam's tight security operation, any successful
effort to oust him likely would have to come from his small inner
circle, CIA officials have said.
   Saddam has ruthlessly squashed dissidents, killing them or
frightening them into exile in London and other world capitals.
   Webster said, however, there have been some ``encouraging
reports'' of some dissatisfaction with Saddam inside Iraq. Economic
sanctions imposed by the United Nations are beginning to take their
toll, he said.
   Iraq's rigid dictatorship and extensive internal security
apparatus make the country a difficult place for U.S. intelligence
agents to work, according to Webster and other officials.
   If the CIA were to pursue any covert action in Iraq, President
Bush would have to sign a ``finding'' allowing such action.
   There have been unconfirmed reports that Bush has signed a
finding, but neither CIA officials nor congressional sources would
comment on such a secret document.
   The term ``finding'' dates from 1973 legislation that says no
money can be channeled to covert action unless ``the president
finds that such an operation is important to the national security
of the United States.''
   Findings must be presented to key members of Congress before the
operation or soon afterward.
   New legislation passed by Congress this week spells out the
finding must be in writing and must coincide with ``identifiable
foreign policy objectives.'' Bush is expected to sign the measure,
which grew out of the Iran-Contra affair.
   David Whipple, head of the Association of Former Intelligence
Officers, said findings usually deal with specific operations, not
broad goals. They detail how much an operation will cost, what it
is designed to achieve and how it will be carried out.
   President Reagan came under intense criticism in the Iran-Contra
affair for making an oral rather than a written finding that
authorized the first arms-for-hostages swap, and for failing to
tell Congress about the finding for more than a year.
   In addition to the finding requirement, a 1976 executive order
bars anyone working for the United States from plotting or carrying
out assassinations. The order was drawn up after congressional
investigators found evidence of CIA involvement in attempts to kill
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   Bush and Congress agreed to review the rules governing covert
action following the unsuccessful October 1989 coup attempt by
Panamanian opponents of Manuel Noriega. American intelligence
officials did not help the coup plotters either logistically or
with advice.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said Congress and the administration agreed to relax the
restrictions so the United States would not be liable if someone
were killed in a covert action.
   ``If a person might be killed incidental to (a coup), that's
quite a bit different from a premeditated assassination,'' said
Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, vice chairman of the intelligence
panel.

<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors won convictions in the
first South Carolina Statehouse corruption trial.
   State Rep. Luther Taylor, one of 10 lawmakers indicted after
being snared in an FBI sting, was convicted Thursday of accepting
$4,300 in bribes for his support of a pari-mutuel betting bill. He
faces up to 120 years in prison and a $1.5 million fine.
   The 40-year-old Columbia Democrat was convicted of six counts of
violating the Hobbs Act, a federal anti-bribery law. An indictment
accused him of accepting five separate bribes and conspiring to
solicit those bribes in exchange for his support of the pari-mutuel
bill.
   Four other lawmakers caught in the sting, labeled ``Operation
Lost Trust,'' pleaded guilty to bribery charges and resigned their
seats. One lawmaker pleaded guilty to drug charges and resigned. A
lobbyist caught in the sting also pleaded guilty to drug charges.
   The remaining four lawmakers face trial in November and
December.
   ``People are not going to put up with public officials selling
the public trust,'' U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel said after Thursday's
verdict.
   He refused to link the Taylor case with the trials of the other
four lawmakers, but he said the verdict at least partially
vindicated the sting against charges of racial bias.
   ``It's pretty easy to make accusations,'' Daniel said. ``But
there's no evidence of (racial bias).''
   Four of the 10 legislators are black, including Taylor and three
of the four awaiting trial, leading to some complaints that the
sting was slanted more toward black members of the Legislature.
   The jury in Taylor's trial had three blacks and nine whites, a
racial makeup close to that of South Carolina's population.
   Jurors reached their verdict after about six hours of
deliberation. Taylor sat expressionless as the verdict was read,
but said outside court he was ``not happy.''
   He remains free on $25,000 bond pending sentencing. He and his
lawyer, Joel Collins, said no decision had been made on whether to
appeal.
   Videotapes and informant Ron Cobb dominated the prosecution's
side of the trial. Cobb, a former Democratic House member who had
become a lobbyist, worked undercover for the FBI after getting
caught in a drug deal.
   He testified he had bribed Taylor with $2,500 to help recruit
other lawmakers to support the pari-mutuel measure, which would
have let voters decide whether to allow betting on horse and dog

<HEAD>Largest Galaxy is 60 Times Size of Milky Way, Astronomers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

   Astronomers reported today they have found the
largest galaxy ever discovered in a concentration of stars that
stretches for 6 million light years, or more than 60 times the size
of the Milky Way.
   A central galaxy in a distant cluster of galaxies called Abell
2029 has more than 100 trillion stars, said a study published in
the journal Science. The Milky Way, which includes the sun and its
solar system, has about 3 billion stars.
   The stellar structure ``is the largest single galaxy that has
been resolved,'' said Jeffrey R. Kuhn, a Michigan State University
astronomer who coauthored the study.
   ``If we talk about the galaxy and the halo (diffused light
around the galaxy) as a single entity, then it is the largest
object that we are aware of,'' he said.
   Until this study, the largest known galaxy was Markarian 348,
which was identified in 1987. It is 1.3 million light years in
diameter.
   Kuhn and his co-investigators, Juan M. Uson of the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory and Stephen P. Boughn of Haverford
College, determined the size of the galaxy using a series of
observations from the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona.
   Sixteen photos taken by the observatory's 36-inch telescope were
processed through a computer that removed from the view all of the
light from other sources. This enabled the scientists to precisely
measure the brightness and size of the galaxy, although individual
stars could not be resolved.
   Later, a second series of photos from Kitt Peak confirmed the
findings.
   Kuhn said the Abell 2029 cluster of galaxies is about a billion
light years away and includes about a thousand galaxies, each with
billions of stars.
   ``If you were to look up into the sky and could see this
cluster, they would occupy an area a little smaller than the
moon,'' he said. ``Of course, they are much fainter than the eye
can see.''
   A light year is 5.89 trillion miles, the distance that light can
travel in one year in a vacuum.
   The very large galaxy, classified by astronomers as a cD (for
central dominant), emits more than a quarter of all the light
radiated by the entire cluster.
   Kuhn said that by analyzing the diffuse light by computer, the
group was able to determine that there was little stellar matter
between the cD galaxy and others in the Abell 2029 cluster. This
suggests, he said, that the cD galaxy and the cluster itself formed
about the same time.
   ``One of the theories about cD galaxies has been that they form
by collisions of galaxies,'' Kuhn said. ``When galaxies collide,
stars in the smaller galaxies end up being stripped away and fall
into this giant galaxy in the middle.''
   But the cD galaxy in Abell 2029, he said, ``is much too large to
have been formed by stripping. It seems likely that it formed at
the same time that the cluster formed and it may have formed out of
remnant material that did not fall into the small galaxies.''
   Also, Kuhn said, if stripping was a factor in the formation of
the galaxy, there would still be clumps of debris giving off light
between the galaxies. But the observations detected only a smooth,
empty space.
   Richard Mushotzky, an astronomer at the Goddard Space Center in
Maryland, said the work may help solve one of the underlying
mysteries in astronomy.
   ``We don't understand how clusters are built,'' Mushotzky said.
``If this (Abell 2029 study) can be verified, it could
substantially advance our understanding of how galaxies and
clusters are formed.''

   Drivers, smokers and drinkers are about to be
socked to cut the federal deficit. But many wealthy Americans,
especially those with big families, may feel they're being soaked.
   A $150 billion, five-year tax increase making its way through
Congress would hit especially hard at high-income people. One new
provision affecting the well-to-do is being criticized as nothing
less than a tax on children.
   It would phase out the tax saving from personal exemptions as
family income rises above $150,000 a year. Losing that tax saving
would have the effect of raising the marginal tax rate on those
families - and the larger the family, the higher the rate.
   ``The dependent exemption is the most vital pro-family feature
of the income tax code,'' Gary L. Bauer, president of the
conservative Family Research Council, said Thursday. ``By phasing
out this exemption, members of Congress are thumbing their noses at
the practice of adjusting tax liability to reflect differences in
household size.''
   Congressional analysts said the emerging bill would raise from
15.4 percent to 16.1 percent the portion of the federal tax burden
paid by those with incomes over $200,000 a year. Their taxes would
rise on the average by 6.3 percent.
   On the other hand, those with incomes under $20,000 would get a
tax cut because of an increase in the earned-income credit for poor
working families with children. Those with incomes between $20,000
and $200,000 would face tax increases in the range of 2 percent,
although the added bite on those between $50,000 and $75,000 would
average only 1.5 percent.
   For most people with incomes under $50,000, the bill's only
increases would come from consumer taxes.
   But for those with higher incomes, especially over $100,000, the
bill would bite in several ways. The biggest change would come from
raising from 28 percent to 31 percent the top income tax rate paid
by the 600,000 wealthiest couples and individuals.
   This would mean a tax increase for single people with taxable
income (after deductions and exemptions) above $97,620 and for
four-member families over $208,690.
   On the other hand, as many as 4 million with taxable incomes
between $78,400 and $208,690 (four-member families) or between
$47,050 and $97,672 (singles) would get tax cuts because their 33
percent top rate would drop to 31 percent. Analysts note that most
members of Congress fall into that income range.
   However, those tax cuts could be illusory. In addition to losing
their exemptions as income rises, those taxpayers would have to
give up part of their itemized deductions when their income, before
subtracting exemptions and deductions, tops the $100,000 mark.
   This same group of taxpayers would get the bill's only tax break
for capital gains - a limited cut on profits from the sale of
investments that is far less than President Bush wants. The bill
would prevent anyone from paying a capital gains rate above 28
percent, which would cut taxes on those who now pay a 33 percent
rate.
   The bill would raise the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax and the
15-cent diesel tax by 5 cents.
   The 16-cent cigarette tax would rise to 20 cents on Jan. 1 and
to 24 cents two years later. Taxes on snuff, cigars and other
tobacco would go up by 25 percent in each of those years.
   The 16-cent levy on a six-pack of beer would double. Negotiators
are deciding whether to raise the tax on liquor, now $12.50 for a
gallon of 100-proof, to $13.70 or $14. Taxes on wines, which vary
according to alcohol content, would go up; the 3-cent levy on a
750-milliliter bottle of table wine, for example, would rise to 21
or 25 cents.
   Airline passengers would pay $6 more on an average, 300-mile
roundtrip ticket. The current 8 percent tax would rise to 10
percent.
   A new tax would take 10 percent of the price of certain
expensive luxuries - cars, boats, planes, jewels and furs. For
example the tax would apply only to that portion of the price of
cars exceeding $30,000 and jewelry over $5,000.
   The 1.45 percent tax that finances basic Medicare coverage would
cost higher-income workers and their employers more. It now applies
only to the first $51,300 earned each year; the bill would raise it
to $125,000 or $130,000.
   A worker earning $85,000 a year, for example, would pay $1,233,
or $489 more than present law. A $50,000 earner would pay no more.
The tax is matched by the employer.

<HEAD>Yale Scientists Develop Vaccine Against Lyme Disease in Lab Mice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Research with mice at Yale University may lead
to a vaccine to protect humans from Lyme disease and perhaps even
syphilis, said a study published today.
   Yale scientists reported in the journal Science that they found
a laboratory mouse that can be infected with the Lyme disease
spirochete bacteria and then used genetic engineering techniques to
make a vaccine that protects the animal against the disease.
   The work could point the way to vaccines for humans, said
Richard A. Flavell, leader of the Yale team, but that is several
years away.
   ``It's very likely that we'll be able to get a good Lyme vaccine
for humans from this technique,'' he said. ``If it works on this
disease, then it may be used to develop vaccines against other
diseases with spirochetes, such as syphilis.''
   A Harvard researcher, however, said the success of a Lyme
disease vaccine, even for mice, cannot be proven until the immunity
is tested against disease in the way it is naturally spread -
through a tick bite.
   David H. Persing of the Harvard School of Public Health said the
saliva of Lyme disease-infected ticks also contains substances that
depress some immune functions. A vaccine would be proven, he said,
only when it is shown to give protection against the effects of
these substances also.
   Lyme disease was first identified in 1975 and named for the
Connecticut town where a Yale study was conducted. The disease is
spread by a small deer tick that passes along the spirochete when
it sucks blood from a victim.
   The disease can cause heart problems, arthritis-like joint pain,
skin rash and even brain disorders. Diagnosed early, it can be
successfully treated with antibiotics.
   Flavell said that to develop the vaccine, the Yale scientists
first had to find a special inbred strain of laboratory mice able
to contract Lyme disease.
   Stephen W. Barthold, a Yale veterinary scientist, tested many
strains before he found that a mouse called C3H-He could be
infected with the Lyme disease spirochete and develop symptoms
within five days.
   To make the vaccine, the researchers cloned a gene for a
protein, called OspA, that is on the surface of the Lyme
spirochete.
   The gene was then spliced into a common laboratory bacteria
which, in turn, produced the OspA protein.
   A purified form of OspA was injected into a group of mice and
tests showed that the rodents developed antibodies to the protein.
   Inoculated mice then were challenged with Lyme disease by
injecting them with the Lyme spirochete.
   Mice that received shots of OspA protein did not get Lyme
disease. Antibodies made by the mouse immune system in response to
the OspA protein were able to keep the bacteria in check. Other
mice that had not received the OspA shots developed the Lyme
symptoms.
   Dr. Erol Fikrig, a member of the Yale team, said the study
required use injected bacteria because the researchers had to know
exactly how much spirochete each mouse received. Using a tick to
spread the disease, he said, ``would be highly variable and could
not be reproduced'' precisely.
   Fikrig acknowledged that laboratory work is not a true test of
vaccine effectiveness against the tick-born disease.
   ``In nature, things could be different and further studies on
that will have to be done,'' he said.
   The importance of the study, he said, is that some immune
protection was demonstrated against a spirochete bacteria.
   ``The fact that we can make a vaccine against this organism is
certainly encouraging that vaccines against other spirochete
illnesses can be developed as well, and that includes syphilis,''
said Fikrig.
   Flavell said it will take five to eight years of additional
laboratory work before the candidate Lyme disease vaccine can be
tried experimentally on humans.

<HEAD>Final Child Care Bill Takes Shape</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Congress Rdp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new $2.5 billion program of grants to the
states is emerging as the centerpiece of major child-care
legislation nearing enactment in Congress.
   Key House and Senate sponsors said their agreement on the
program would break a months-long deadlock over child-care
assistance.
   Differences remain over additional related elements, including
an expansion of tax credits for low-income families. But
congressional sponsors said those differences would be resolved
with the pending deficit-reduction tax package and would not hamper
the grant program.
   The Senate passed a version of the bill more than a year ago,
and the House approved a more ambitious measure earlier this year,
but the issue has been stalled in conference panels for months.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., told reporters Thursday that
final negotiations had gained the support of House leaders for the
child-care agreement he worked out with administration officials
earlier this month.
   ``I'm confident whatever the (budget) reconciliation bill looks
like, child care will be a part of it,'' Dodd said.
   The agreement calls for establishment of a program of block
grants to the states to provide direct assistance to low-income
families for child-care and support to schools and community
agencies that provide child care.
   Details of a roughly $13 billion expansion of the earned income
tax credit sought by congressional tax writers remain to be worked
out. The money would go to low-income working families with
children, but it would not be tied to child care expenses.
   Dodd said the credit expansion was intended primarily to make
the total package of tax increases in the budget bill more
progressive.
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., a sponsor of the House's child-care
bill, balked last week after Dodd agreed with the White House on
the grant program and the Senate quickly incorporated it into its
version of a deficit-reduction package.
   Downey said Thursday he now will go along with the grants but is
trying to add a program of child-care assistance for poor families
under the Social Security Act.
   The price tag on that would be an additional $1.5 billion over
five years. Downey and Dodd said the money could come from scaling
back the tax credit.
   The grant program would carry a $2.5 billion authorization over
three years, and Dodd said he expected it to reach $5 billion in
five years. A portion, $180 million of the $750 million first-year
total, would go to early childhood education and ``latchkey''
after-school care, based in schools or run by community groups.
   The long holdup in final congressional approval, and the scaling
back of the package from earlier versions, drew criticism from
members of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues. They also
complained that no women were included in two conference committees
that considered the bill.
   ``Minuscule,'' Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said of the
legislation. ``It's about a quarter loaf, compared to what the
House passed.''
   ``We'll take whatever it is and build on it next year,'' said
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.
   On other domestic legislation Thursday:
   -The House approved by voice vote a compromise, $57.4 billion
housing bill. It would restructure housing programs, shore up the
financially troubled Federal Housing Administration and extend the
life of low-interest mortgage programs.
   The bill authorizes $27.5 billion this fiscal year, a 63 percent
increase over the previous year's appropriations and $3.3 billion
over what would be required to maintain current policies. It
provides $29.9 billion in fiscal 1992.
   The FHA overhaul will assess a new annual premium on borrowers
of FHA-backed loans that would increase minimum upfront closing
costs. For example, the buyer of a $65,000 home would need $3,639
in cash, about $800 more than the current average requirement.
   -The House rejected for a second time a bill that would permit
taxpayer-financed abortions in the District of Columbia. The bill
was identical to the appropriations bill for Washington's city
government that the House rejected, 211-185, last Saturday. This
time the vote to reject was 211-195.
   Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the D.C. appropriations
subcommittee, said he would return the bill to a House-Senate
conference and delete the expanded abortion provisions. The bill
would permit the city government to use locally raised taxes for
abortions, and would permit use of federal money for abortions for
poor women in cases of rape or incest.
   -A $182 billion spending bill for the Labor, Education and
Health and Human Services departments was held up by unrelated
Senate amendments. The bill, which would increase spending by $22
billion over last year's levels, is the largest domestic
appropriations bill.
   -A $78 billion spending bill for the Veterans Affairs and
Housing and Urban Development departments and independent agencies
was approved by the Senate and sent back to the House with
amendments. It includes $14 billion for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, whose 14 percent increase was the largest
of any agency in the bill.

   Doctors who transplanted part of a woman's
lung into her dying daughter said the procedure - believed to be a
first in this country -greatly reduces the chances of transplant
rejection.
   The girl, 12, and her mother, 46, whose names were withheld at
the family's request, were reported in good condition after their
operations Thursday at Stanford University Medical Center.
   ``The mother was a far closer tissue match than could have been
expected from an unrelated donor,'' said Dr. Vaughn Starnes, who
heads the medical center's heart-lung transplant team.
   Kidneys and a portion of a liver have been transplanted from
living donors, but all lung transplants in this country have
previously involved brain-dead donors, Stanford officials said.
People have survived removal of a disease  lung.
   Starnes said that the mother and child matched on four of six
genetic markers, or tissue antigens, compared with no more than two
such matches in previous lung and heart transplants involving
brain-dead donors.
   He said transplants from related, live donors are particularly
important for children because youngsters have a higher rate of
rejection than adults.
   Half of 14 children who have received heart-lung transplants at
Stanford suffered rejection severe enough to impair lung function.
That's nearly twice the rejection rate of the 71 adults who have
undergone the same operation at the medical center.
   ``These children have so much trouble with rejection that the
transplant almost isn't worth it with an unrelated donor,'' said
Marguerite Brown, a nurse who coordinates Stanford's donor program.
   During Thursday's surgery, doctors removed the upper one-third
of the mother's right lung and transplanted it in the child's chest
in place of her right lung.
   The girl suffers from a rare malady called bronchopulmonary
dysplasia that causes scarring and high blood pressure of the
lungs.
   ``The child was already experiencing difficulty breathing and
required home oxygen and therefore was going to sustain serious
damage,'' Starnes said.
   He said the mother should regain almost total function of her
partial lung. The daughter is expected to be able to fully use the
transplanted lung, which will likely increase in capacity and may
even grow in her body.
   ``Both mother and daughter are expected to resume normal
activity within a few months,'' Starnes said.
   Stanford doctors expect the girl to remain hospitalized for
several weeks. The mother probably will go home earlier.

<HEAD>Agency Investigates False Positive at North Carolina Lab</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials of the National Institute on Drug
Abuse are trying to find out why drug testing by a
government-certified laboratory in North Carolina incorrectly
identified five people as using illegal methamphetamines.
   In each case, the lab's confirmatory tests confused the
stimulant drug with high doses of over-the-counter cold medications
containing ephedrine and other stimulants, said Dr. Joseph Autry,
director of applied research at the government institute.
   ``This is one (type of) test in one lab for one drug, and it's
the only time a false positive has happened in a NIDA-certified
lab,'' Autry said. ``We're taking it very seriously.''
   The case that brought the problem to the government's attention
was that of a truck driver, who was removed from his job last July
despite his vehement denials that he was falsely accused, officials
said.
   Officials did not identify him and said his case has resulted in
litigation. He was tested under Transportation Department
regulations requiring drug testing of employees in
department-regulated industries. This testing must be done by one
of the 57 labs certified by the institute.
   The laboratory that conducted the tests was suspended last week
while institute officials try to determine whether the problem was
with the lab's testing or was inherent in the testing procedure
itself, Autry said.
   The testing problem could have broad repercussions, such as if
the case were used by critics to try to block drug testing
altogether, he said.
   The lab was identified in the Federal Register as Roche
Biomedical Laboratories of Research Triangle Park, N.C. Company
officials did not return a telephone call for comment Thursday.
   In the case of the truck driver, his vehement denial of
methamphetamine use prompted more confirmatory testing by the lab.
This further testing showed the previous result to have been
incorrect.
   When institute officials learned of the false positive, they
checked the seven other samples that had tested positive for
methamphetamines by Roche in recent months, and found five were
negative, officials said.
   NIDA officials alerted the 56 other laboratories the institute
has certified for drug testing, and found that eight were using the
same methamphetamine test Roche was. About 100 samples tested by
these labs had come out positive, and all are being rechecked,
Autry said. He expected results in about two weeks.
   The testing procedure being questioned is used to confirm the
presence of methamphetamines. Several other methods also are used
and no false positives have been discovered with any of those,
Autry said.
   He said he did not know how many private testing laboratories
may be using the method Roche was using.
   Transportation Department testing regulations require that a
worker who tests positive for methamphetamines, amphetamines, PCP,
opiates, marijuana or cocaine be removed from a safety-sensitive
job.
   But if the finding is reversed, regulations do not require that
the worker be reinstated; they only prevent the employer from
refusing to reinstate the worker on the basis of the inaccurate
test.

   Republicans enlisted Bart Simpson without his
permission, Chevy Chase added $50,000 to Dianne Feinstein's
campaign and Angela Lansbury was lambasted for what critics called
``Distortions, She Wrote.''
   It's lights, camera and political action in Hollywood, where a
few golden words from a celebrity can speak decibels louder than
dozens of stump speeches by politicians.
   Movie and television stars are getting behind gubernatorial
candidates from both parties, as well as Big Green, a sweeping
state environmental initiative.
   ``There are many entertainers who by their past work have become
trusted by the public, and for them to research and then support an
issue like Big Green helps us spread the word,'' said initiative
spokesman Duane Peterson.
   As the political free-for-all nears its Nov. 6 election day
conclusion, one cartoon celebrity found himself backing a cause he
didn't embrace and a highly regarded TV star opposed a pair of
measures she didn't fully understand.
   Bart Simpson, the animated underachiever of TV's ``The
Simpsons,'' was quoted at length in a Republican news release about
Democrat Feinstein's use of crib notes during a debate against U.S.
Sen. Pete Wilson.
   ``If you're gonna use cheat sheets, man, use `em right,'' Bart
was quoted as saying. He even offered this advice: ``The best is
taping the notes in your shoe, dude.''
   The Fox Broadcasting Co., which broadcasts ``The Simpsons,''
never gave permission to use the character or his words, but Bart's
creator, cartoonist Matt Groening, shrugged it all off.
   ``That doesn't surprise me,'' said Groening. ``Republicans think
they own everything anyway.''
   Television commercials by Miss Lansbury, star of CBS' ``Murder,
She Wrote,'' opposing a pair of intiatives that would limit terms
for most state officials went on the air Tuesday and drew harsh
criticism from supporters.
   Lewis Uhler, a primary author of one bill, labeled the TV spots
``Distortions, She Wrote.''
   The actress did not know the commercials were paid for by state
legislators and did not fully understand other provisions of the
bills, said her son and agent, David Shaw.
   Proponents of the Uhler-written bill said the commercials
incorrectly suggest that the measure would require public funding
of campaigns.
   ``She doesn't really read newspapers,'' Shaw said, adding that
his mother does oppose term limits and would not seek to have the
ads pulled.
   Station KCBS-TV said Thursday is planned to pull the ads until a
dispute over truth in advertising was resolved. Ads typically must
include a mention of who paid for them.
   Feinstein got a boost from comedy actor Chase with his $50,000
donation. He also performed at an event that featured Henry Mancini
and Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry of ``L.A. Law.''
   The large donation brought criticism from the Wilson camp, but
Wilson got his share of celebrity support at an October fund-raiser
headlined by first lady Barbara Bush. Among the stars on hand were
Chuck Norris, Donald O'Connor, Scott Baio, Phyllis Diller, Efrem
Zimbalist Jr. and ``Entertainment Tonight'' hostess Mary Hart.
   For sheer star power, nothing beat the campaign for Big Green,
which would affect a wide range of environmental issues including
toxic dumping, offshore oil drilling and trash recycling.
   The campaign is co-sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden of Santa
Monica and state Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who lost to
Feinstein in the Democratic primary.
   Celebrity supporters include Jane Fonda, Meryl Streep, Robin
Williams, Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, Cher, Olivia Newton-John and
Ted Danson.
   ``This is not a point of view,'' Danson said. ``I'm not
comparing environmental issues to other issues.
   ``The environment just pretty much is - it's rocks are hard,
water is wet. You may agree or disagree, but it has nothing to do
with the reality of what's happening. Acid rain is not a point of
view. Dirty harbors are not a point of view. It's reality.''

<HEAD>Farm Bill Sent to President Bush</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 1990 farm bill, an omnibus measure that
could reshape American agriculture, is headed to President Bush,
who is expected to sign it.
   The Senate approved the bill 60-36 Thursday, two days after
318-102 passage in the House.
   Bush administration officials, who worked with Congress in
devising the package, have said the president would be satisfied
with the five-year, $40.8 billion measure. The bill sets policy for
virtually every operation in the Agriculture Department.
   It establishes new environmental rules for farmers, sets the
government's nutrition programs, including food stamps, determines
trade policy for food products and sets the government's support
programs for commodities.
   Opposition to the bill came from senators who feared for farmers
in their states if a 15 percent reduction in subsidized acreage in
the measure goes into effect.
   The change in support hinges on Congress passing a $13.6 billion
spending cut for agriculture over the next five years.
   Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., who voted against the bill, said
the change in the subsidy program ``amounts to a slow economic
death sentence for the nation's family farmers.''
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said it threatens the livelihood of
one out of every three farmers.
   ``I don't think the senators know what they will be doing to
American farmers if this bill becomes law,'' Baucus said. ``Next
year we must make improvements in the farm program.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the ranking Republican on the
Senate Agriculture Committee, said debate over farm bills often
includes forecasts of dire consequences for farmers.
   ``Predictions for the last two farm bills were egregiously off
the mark,'' Lugar said. He said farm income need not fall simply
because subsidized acreage is reduced.
   Lugar said target prices have been frozen and loan rates in some
areas raised. He said farmers would be able to use the 15 percent
of the acreage being taken off government subsidized crops to plant
according to consumer demand.
   ``American farmers will determine their income by the expertise
they have,'' he said.
   Throughout debate on the bill, Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., emphasized its environmental
provisions. He called it ``one of the most important environmental
laws passed by this Congress.''
   He blamed ``free-wheeling'' spending policies of the Reagan-Bush
administrations for the need to cut farm subsidies.
   ``If we'd had more of this reality over the last 10 years we
wouldn't have the deficit we have today,'' Leahy said.
   The legislation's environmental measures would:
   -Allow farmers to drain wetlands for farming without net loss of
important wildlife habitats by selling the federal government a
conservation easement on their property that can be restored to
wetland status.
   -Create an incentive program to help farmers prevent
contamination of ground and surface water on 10 million acres of
land.
   -Require the Agriculture Department to help farmers meet state
and federal environmental standards.
   -Require farmers to keep records of hazardous pesticide use and
authorize the first effort to assess the threat of global climate
change on agriculture.
   The conference committee dropped a provision in the original
Senate bill that would have prohibited export sales of pesticides
banned or unregistered in the United States. Chemical companies
said it would cause grave economic damage, but Leahy said he would
reintroduce the measure next year.
   The bill also:
   -Establishes a program to protect 25 million acres of private
forestland.
   -Creates national standards for organic farming.
   -Creates a rural development administration within USDA to help
communities recover economically from the loss of farms.
   -Sets up a satellite program for rural hospitals and schools to
receive information from urban areas.
   -Establishes a matching fund program for rural businesses.
   -Authorizes increased funds for existing water and sewer
programs in rural communities to improve drinking water and waste
disposal.
   -Freezes target prices on wheat at $4 a bushel; corn, $2.75 a
bushel; grain sorghum, $2.61 a bushel; barley $2.36 a bushel; oats,
$1.45 a bushel; cotton, 73 cents a pound, rice $10.71 per hundred
pounds.
   -Sets an 18 cent loan rate on sugar.
   -Freezes government dairy prices at $10.10 per hundred pounds,
but requires the agriculture secretary to report to Congress on
other options for the dairy program by Aug. 31, 1991. An assessment
will be levied on dairy producers if government surpluses exceed 7
billion pounds.
   -Sets a $5.02 a bushel loan rate on soybeans with a 2 percent
service charge.

<HEAD>Governor's Race Hot in Oklahoma</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat David Walters is billing himself
as a political outsider while Republican opponent Bill Price is
emphasizing his crime-fighting credentials in a bitter governor's
race in Oklahoma.
   Price is suing Walters for libel. Walters is accusing Price of
trying to buy the election. And the Republican is emphasizing
Walters' ties to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   President Bush flies to Oklahoma on Monday to campaign for Price
and Vice President Dan Quayle was in Oklahoma on Oct. 9 on a
fund-raising mission for the Republican.
   For Walters, a victory would be a comeback. The 38-year-old
businessman became mired in a long legal battle over a questionable
$162,500 campaign loan in 1986, when he won the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination. He lost in the general election four
years ago to Republican Henry Bellmon, who is retiring.
   Price, 42, is making his first political race. But he was a
high-profile federal prosecutor in the early 1980s, heading an
investigation into a county commissioner kickback scandal in
Oklahoma in which some 240 people were convicted.
   Walters, as he did in 1986, is offering himself as a political
outsider who can bring a new approach to government.
   Price has portrayed Walters as a liberal in a conservative
state. Walters was the Oklahoma chairman of Dukakis' presidential
campaign.
   Walters is the person who tried to ``ram Michael Dukakis down
the throats'' of Oklahomans, says one Price radio ad.
   The reduced office rental rate which Walters gave Dukakis is the
subject of a federal election complaint filed by the state GOP
chairman.
   The Walters-Price race is the most expensive political campaign
in Oklahoma history.
   Walters is expected to spend more than $2 million and Price
upwards of $1.8 million. The bill for the governor's race, counting
losing candidates in the primaries, is expected to be about $8
million - more than double the amount spent four years ago. The
Walters campaign collected $600,000 at a fund-raiser this week.
   Walters has accused Price of trying to buy the election by
putting $435,000 of his own money into the race.
   Walters alleged this month that Price was involved in price
gouging on oil taken from land held in a family trust. Price,
according to Walters, was among a group of people fined $1.74
million for oil overcharges. Price denied the accusations and filed
a libel suit against Walters and a campaign consultant.
   ``Bill Price can dish it out, but he can't take it,'' Walters
told Price on a radio broadcast this month.
   ``You have a total disregard for the truth,'' Price snapped.
   The clashes over campaign financing, political affiliations and
business practices have obscured issues such as education and
taxes.
   The two candidates differ on repeal of a $223 million school
reform and tax bill enacted earlier this year, with Bellmon's
backing. Walters opposes repeal, saying that would cause too many
problems for schools and hurt the state's image nationally.
   Price says the threat of repeal through an initiative petition
is the only way to force the Legislature to enact what he views as
needed education reforms, such as an open transfer policy for
students and merit pay for teachers.
   There has been no publicly released independent polling data on
the governor's race. Walters is considered the frontrunner, mainly
because Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 2-to-1 ratio in
Oklahoma. Also, Price was embroiled in an unusually heated GOP
primary. Price had to rally from a second-place showing in the
primary in order to upend businessman Vince Orza in a runoff
election.

   Congress is taking final action on a 1991
defense bill that slashes President Bush's budget request for the
Strategic Defense Initiative and barely keeps alive the B-2 stealth
bomber program.
   The Senate was expected to approve companion military spending
and authorization bills today.
   The spending bill totals $268 billion, a cut of $19 billion from
Bush's initial proposal in January.
   Among the provisions in the bills are a nearly $2 billion cut in
the president's $4.7 billion request for the anti-missile SDI
program, a reduction in funds for the B-2 bomber that keeps the
program alive for at least one more year and sharp cuts in money
for land-based nuclear missiles.
   The bill also provides money for the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor
aircraft that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has tried to cancel for
two years.
   The House on Thursday gave voice-vote approval to the spending
bill, which largely tracks the authorization bill but diverges from
that blueprint on several issues.
   The spending plan calls for a troop cut of 78,500 from the
2.1-million-member active force, just over $900 million for the
MILSTAR communications satellite and full-scale development of the
Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   Bush requested $283 million for full-scale development and $763
million to complete the demonstration and validation phase of the
prototype aircraft.
   The defense blueprint provides $964 million for the program but
prohibits full-scale development in the current fiscal year, which
began Oct. 1.
   The authorization bill emphasizes the need for the Air Force to
finish demonstrating several technologies, including aerodynamic
performance, low observability and engine capability, before
beginning full-scale development of the new fighter.
   The Pentagon plans to begin buying the first of 750 planes,
intended to replace the Air Force's F-15, in 1996.
   The spending bill concurs with the administration's request on
the fighter as well as its proposal for the SRAM-T, a tactical
nuclear weapon.
   The authorization measure reduces U.S. troop levels by 100,000,
but, bowing to pressure from the Pentagon, gives the defense
secretary added authority to limit the troop cut to 80,000 if he
believes the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf warrants
such a step.
   The authorization bill also provides $600 million for MILSTAR,
but again, responding to Pentagon demands, permits Cheney to
transfer money from other accounts for the program.

   ``I know that the people of Hawaii will receive President Bush

with him to participate in all the activities.
   ``I express my sincere gratitude to him for coming to Hawaii and

   The large sign outside his house

   A letter signed by President Bush seeking

Republicans such as Don Nickles, John Inhofe and Mickey Edwards.''
   But Mr. President, it's Jim Inhofe.
   The letter was mailed to Oklahomans recently in search of GOP
campaign funds, the Tulsa World reported. Inhofe and Edwards are
Oklahoma congressmen. Don Nickles is an Oklahoma U.S. senator.
   The wrong-name syndrome is hardly new for Republican presidents
campaigning in Oklahoma.
   In 1986, President Reagan referred to Nickles as ``Don Rickles''
at a GOP rally at the University of Oklahoma.
   In 1964, GOP presidential nominee Barry Goldwater came to Tulsa
to campaign for then-U.S. Rep. Page Belcher. He urged the
re-election of ``my good friend, Page Bellmon.'' Henry Bellmon was
governor at the time.

   A television ad by Michigan Supreme Court
candidate Clark Durant re-enacts a murder and criticizes the high
court for throwing out a 200-year sentence in the case.
   The 30-second ad begins with a pistol firing two shots and then
cuts to a woman struggling with a man and then running through a
house screaming for help. The re-enactment ends with a close-up of
a knife held up in the air.
   ``This is unprecedented. There's never been anything like this
in Michigan. This is Freddy Krueger hits the campaign trail for the
Supreme Court,'' said political analyst William Ballenger,
referring to a horror movie villain.
   The re-enactment is of a Feb. 25, 1985, murder in which a woman
was shot twice, then stabbed at least seven times. Timothy Moore
was convicted of second-degree murder in Detroit Recorders Court
and sentenced to 100 to 200 years in prison.
   The Michigan Court of Appeals upheld the sentence, but the high

   Truck drivers, pressmen and hundreds of other
union workers for the Daily News went on strike Thursday night
after months of bickering erupted in violence over a worker sitting
down on the job.
   News management published a Friday edition. Relief drivers
trucked the first copies out of the paper's Garden City, N.Y.,
plant early Friday past 200 to 300 picketing strikers. Police said
five picketers there were arrested.
   Within an hour, six trucks accompanied by 25 police officers in
riot gear carried papers out of the News' Kearny, N.J., plant. The
vehicles' windows were covered with duct tape to protect them
against rocks thrown by the crowd of 200 strikers.
   A short time later, three trucks surrounded by 100 police
officers rolled past jeering protesters outside the News' printing
plant in the city borough of Brooklyn.
   Strikers there pelted buses carrying replacement workers with
bottles, rocks and eggs, breaking some windows. A fireworks-style
explosive was set off underneath one bus. Police reported two
arrests.
   Michael Alvino, president of the drivers' union, got cheers from
his membership when he announced the strike.
   Seven of the newspaper's 10 unions followed the drivers' lead,
said George McDonald, head of the Allied Printing Trades Council,
the umbrella group for the unions. A ninth union, the Newspaper
Guild, said it would honor the picket lines.
   The 10th union, for typographical workers, had said it would not
strike because it has lifetime guaranteed jobs for its 200 members.
   About 1,800 workers went on strike. The Newspaper Guild, whose
members planned to meet Friday, has about 800 members.
   Picket lines were set up at the newspaper's Manhattan building
and outside its three printing plants.
   About 2 a.m. Friday, three to four hours later than usual, the
first copies of Friday's edition were trucked out of the Garden
City plant, said a News management source who spoke on condition
that his name not be used.
   The source could not say how many copies would be printed. The
paper's usual weekday circulation is 1.18 million.
   ``The trucks have been in and out. The papers are getting out,''
Lt. William Fitzpatrick of the Garden City police confirmed. He
said five of 200 to 300 picketers were arrested, mostly on
disorderly conduct charges. He reported no serious injuries.
   Two people were charged with disorderly conduct at the Brooklyn
plant, police said. One threw a rock at a bus carrying replacement
workers but missed and hit a police officer. Details of the second
charge were not immediately available.
   ``It is indeed unfortunate that a strike was provoked by these
unions against the Daily News at a time when we were involved in
the collective bargaining process to resolve our differences,''
said John Sloan, the newspaper's vice president for labor
relations.
   The strike comes more than six months after the expiration of
contracts between the Daily News and its 10 unions, months marked
by bitter exchanges but stalemated negotiations.
   The strike followed a walkout early Thursday at the Brooklyn
printing plant in a dispute over a union worker's right to do his
job sitting down. A bus carrying replacement workers at the plant
was attacked by about 200 employees with sticks, smashing its
windshield. Police cited two workers.
   Following the attack, labor accused management of a lockout.
   A coalition of the newspaper's 10 unions met Thursday afternoon,
then sent leaders to a meeting with management at the Daily News'
headquarters. They emerged 50 minutes later, shaken.
   The Daily News is the nation's second largest metropolitan daily
and has 3,500 employees. But during the past decade it has lost
about $115 million and seen daily circulation slip by about
700,000.
   The Daily News has been caught in one of the nation's fiercest
newspaper wars and analysts have questioned whether the city can
support three tabloids and The New York Times.
   The New York Post and New York Newsday planned to increase press
runs.
   The Daily News' managers say they need to end labor abuses, have
the ability to set staff sizes and save $50 million to $70 million
annually.
   The unions say the newspaper is trying to break them and they
have called for an advertisers' boycott.
   The workers walked out early Thursday after their business
agent, Seymour Goldstein, was ejected from the plant by management,
according to George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing
Trades Council, a union umbrella group.
   ``It's indeed unfortunate, No. 1, that the drivers union has
struck the Daily News when we are in the process of collective
bargaining. And, No. 2, it's indeed unfortunate that they resorted
to unruly and violent behavior,'' responded Sloan.
   Sloan said about 800,000 copies of Thursday's News had been
printed.
   The crisis apparently began when Goldstein became involved in a
dispute involving a drivers' union member who was working while
sitting down.
   McDonald said the man's job did not involve driving, but
required him to make sure newspapers properly came off of a
conveyor belt; that he was on ``light duty'' because of a
disability; and that many healthy workers normally sit and read
magazines while doing the job.
   When supervisors told the man to work standing, Goldstein said,
``He appealed to me. I told him to sit down. They gave me two
choices: leave or be escorted out. They escorted me out.''
   When Goldstein went out, so did the drivers, McDonald said.
   Sloan said Goldstein was expelled for ``countermanding a direct
order from the supervisor. As far as we are concerned, (whether the
employee is disabled) is not the issue here.'' The employee was
suspended.
   The bus carrying replacement workers arrived little more than
half an hour later.
   ``This was an organized plan to lock us out,'' Goldstein said.
``Security is under orders to not let us in.''
   Two men were given tickets for criminal offenses, one for
allegedly inciting workers to do further damage, the other for
letting the air out of delivery truck tires. Neither was held.
   Other News employees were seen draining radiators on delivery
trucks, and police later said the radiators of 40 trucks were
punctured. Firefighters put out a small fire in the back of a
delivery truck, and another truck was gutted by fire.
   Angry employees also blocked the street with about 20 delivery
trucks.

<HEAD>Retired Justice Powell: Vote in Georgia Sodomy Case Probably a
`Mistake'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell
says he ``probably made a mistake'' in casting the pivotal vote in
a 1986 decision that denied the right of privacy to consenting
homosexuals.
   But he still regards the decision upholding Georgia's
anti-sodomy law as ``one of little or no importance'' because no
one actually had been prosecuted for homosexual conduct, Powell
said.
   His current views on the matter were revealed during a
question-and-answer session after a lecture the retired justice
delivered at New York University School of Law on Oct. 18.
   According to The National Law Journal, Powell told the law
students, ``I think I probably made a mistake in that one'' when
asked about the 5-4 ruling in 1986.
   In a report to be published Monday, the legal newspaper quotes
Powell as saying in an interview that he now believes sodomy
decision conflicts with the court's approach to privacy rights in
its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion. Powell
voted with the majority in that ruling.
   ``I do think (the 1986 decision) was inconsistent in a general
way with Roe,'' Powell told the newspaper. ``When I had the
opportunity to re-read the opinion a few months later, I thought
the dissent had the better of the argument.''
   Powell told The Associated Press on Thursday he stands by the
statement he made to the National Law Journal. But he said he is
surprised his re-evaluation of the 1986 ruling is considered
newsworthy.
   ``I thought it was a frivolous case,'' Powell said. ``I still
think it was a frivolous case. But perhaps on more reflection I
could have reached a different result.''
   The 1986 ruling was one of the most publicized and controversial
high court rulings of that term. The Washington Post later reported
that Powell originally planned to vote to strike down Georgia's ban
on sodomy.
   The newspaper, quoting anonymous sources, said Powell voted at a
private conference of the nine justices to strike down the Georgia
law. Such votes are tentative, and justices may change their minds
before the decisions are announced.
   Justice Byron R. White, who wrote the court's majority opinion
in the 1986 case, said, ``The proposition that any kind of private
sexual conduct between consenting adults is constitutionally
insulated from state proscription is unsupportable.''
   The decision has been bitterly denounced by gay rights groups.
   The court's interpretation of the scope of privacy rights
remains one of the hottest issues confronting the justices -
especially in the area of abortion. The court has held that
Americans have a fundamental privacy right to marry, have children
and practice birth control.
   The Georgia law was challenged by Michael Hardwick, an Atlanta
bartender and homosexual who was arrested in 1982 for allegedly
committing sodomy in his home. Prosecutors later dropped the
charge, which carries a maximum 20-year prison penalty upon
conviction.
   The case reached the Supreme Court after Hardwick sued Georgia
officials to have the law declared unconstitutional.
   In Atlanta, the Atlanta Gay Alliance said it understood Hardwick
had moved to Key West, Fla. There was no telephone listed for him
there.

<HEAD>Elusive Scientist Agrees To Appear for Cold Fusion Review</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PEG McENTEE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist who pioneered Utah's cold
fusion research and dropped out of contact before skipping a state
oversight committee meeting belatedly agreed to meet with the panel
early next month.
   Members of the Fusion Energy Advisory Council on Thursday voted
to try to force electrochemist B. Stanley Pons to appear for the
Nov. 7 review. Minutes later, Pons agreed in a telephone call to
show up.
   ``I told him he was wanted, that it was necessary,'' Chief
Deputy Attorney General Joe Tesch told the council. ``Stan Pons
committed he would be here on Nov. 7.''
   The telephone call arranged by Pons' attorney appeared to ease
the panel's irritation with Pons and British colleague Martin
Fleischmann for missing the meeting and being virtually
unreachable, except through their lawyer.
   ``We are perfectly willing to fund the work, but we do expect
accountability,'' said Raymond Hixson, council chairman. ``We must
know what we are getting for the money.''
   The advisory council oversees the state's interest in the
research. The Legislature appropriated $5 million following the
electrochemists' March 1989 announcement that they had achieved a
fusion reaction in a tabletop experiment at room temperature.
   If true, the achievement could prove a cheap solution to energy
sources. But most scientists remain skeptical, Fritz Will, director
of the National Cold Fusion Institute, told the panel in an
overview of the institute's research.
   Will said dozens of scientists around the world have reported
achieving similar results. He said experiments continue to produce
excess heat and other nuclear fusion indicators.
   He declined to discuss the specific experiments being done by
Pons and Fleischmann.
   Fusion is the process that powers the sun, stars and hydrogen
bombs. It is achieved when atomic paticles fuse and release large
amounts of energy. The process usually requires millions of degrees
of heat to get started.
   The panel's unanimous decision to ask University of Utah
President Chase Peterson to apply pressure on Pons to attend a
review grew out of its frustration with his unexplained absence.
   The pair's attorney, C. Gary Triggs, told Tesch the researchers
were reluctant to appear Thursday because of a patent application
they were preparing.
   Hixson said that argument was faulty because the state will own
any patents produced from the work and panel members are sworn to
secrecy.
   Fleischmann, reached at his home in Tisbury, England, said he
had not learned of the council meeting until a journalist told him
late Wednesday.
   Will said he had faxed a notice to Fleischmann more than a week
ago and later telephoned the scientist's office, only to be told he
was unavailable.
   ``We have attempted to have the two present during an external
review in October. We have abundantly explained; they have
categorically refused,'' Will said before the meeting.
   Triggs said Pons and Fleischmann had explained they would be out
of the country during October.
   The attorney would not say where Pons had gone, although the
teacher of his young son said Wednesday the family had told her
they would be in France for ``a year or two.''
   Pons has applied for a one-year sabbatical. Peterson said the
request would be handled by the Chemistry Department, whcih Pons
once chaired.
   Besides the scientific review, the institute is scrambling for
renewed funding. An audit was completed recently, but State Auditor
Tom Allen said he would not disclose its recommendations until the
institute has responded.

<HEAD>Ethics Committee Orders Investigation of News Leaks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee says it has
arranged for an outside investigation of unauthorized disclosures
after news leaks from its probe of five senators linked to a failed
savings and loan.
   The panel, after a lengthy closed meeting Thursday, also labeled
as false a report saying it was considering giving Charles H.
Keating Jr., who headed failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association,
an assurance that information he gives to Congress will not be used
against him.
   ``The committee has at no time discussed or considered granting
immunity to Charles Keating Jr.,'' the panel said. ``Reports to the
contrary are incorrect.''
   The Los Angeles Times quoted unidentified committee sources in a
Thursday report that said Ethics Committee members were weighing a
guarantee known as limited immunity for Keating. The Times'
national editor, Norman Miller, said Thursday the newspaper stood
by its story.
   ``We believe our sources are accurate,'' Miller said. ``It may
be there's some technical difference that could account for their
statement. But we're confident we were given a correct story.''
   A grant of limited immunity for a defendant appearing before
Congress could jeopardize a criminal prosecution. This kind of
immunity means a prosecutor can make no use of the testimony.
   The committee is investigating whether the so-called ``Keating
Five'' senators violated ethics rules in interceding with federal
regulators on behalf of Lincoln Savings. Hearings are scheduled to
begin Nov. 15.
   Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Donald
W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and John McCain,
R-Ariz., received a total of $1.3 million in campaign
contributions, or donations to favored causes, from Keating, former
chairman of Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., Lincoln's
parent company.
   All five have denied any connection between Keating's money and
their help for the Irvine, Calif.-based thrift, which was seized by
the U.S. government in April 1989 at a potential cost to taxpayers
of more than $2 billion.
   If the committee eventually decides Senate rules were broken, it
could recommend that the full Senate impose severe sanctions such
as a censure or expulsion or it could administer a mild punishment
itself such as a letter of rebuke.
   In a statement signed by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., the
chairman, and Vice-Chairman Warren Rudman, R-N.H., the panel said
Thursday ``it appears ... some committee sensitive documents have
been disclosed to the press.''
   ``Some of these press articles have contained a number of
inaccuracies, distortions and misstatements,'' it said. ``Because
some of these disclosures may have come from the committee itself,
we concluded that an outside organization would be best able to
conduct an independent and impartial inquiry into this matter.''
   The panel said it asked the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, to conduct the probe.
   ``The committee will not speculate upon motives,'' the statement
said, ``but does observe that such conduct discredits the
individuals responsible, and violates the committee's rules.''
   Keating, 66, and the three associates face 42 counts of
securities fraud related to the sale of $200 million in bonds by
Lincoln's Southern California branches to thousands of investors.
   Lincoln collapsed in April 1989, rendering the bonds worthless.
Bailing out Lincoln could cost taxpayers $2 billion, regulators
have said.
   Keating is free on $300,000 bail. Trial in Superior Court in Los
Angeles is set to begin on Nov. 26.
   Documents recently obtained by The Associated Press and others
indicate that Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle had more extensive
relationships with Keating than they previously acknowledged.
   For example, the documents show that Cranston wrote Keating to
thank him for a $250,000 contribution to a Cranston-backed voter
registration project and at the same time expressed his pleasure
that Keating met with the top thrift regulator to plead his case
about Lincoln.

<HEAD>Influence Peddling Charges, Infighting Shake Brazil's Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resignations, charges of influence
peddling and infighting are damaging the image of President
Fernando Collor de Mello's 7-month-old conservative government.
   ``The government retains its authority but its credibility has
been substantially weakened,'' said prominent sociologist Helio
Jaguaribe. ``Collor must take action soon to control the damage.''
   The charges are especially harmful because Collor promised to
build a ``new Brazil,'' with morality and austerity as its
foundations, waging a painful war on inflation.
   Even though the president has not been directly implicated in
any alleged wrongdoing, his image appears to have suffered.
   On Wednesday, Collor addressed the subject for the first time
during a five-day visit to Portugal, saying he would dismiss any
government official who ``sacrificed the ideas that are taking us
forward.''
   The president reportedly called a Monday Cabinet meeting to
discuss the situation.
   Collor's administration has been shaken in recent weeks by a
series of well-publicized events. Among the most damaging:
   -On Oct. 19, Luis Octavio da Motta Veiga, head of the huge state
oil monopoly Petrobras, was forced to step down. He said the cause
was his refusal to approve a $40 million loan to a Sao Paulo
businessman, despite pressure from Collor's friend and power broker
Paulo Cesar Farias.
   Presidential spokesman Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva said Motta
Veiga was fired due to ``incompetence and insubordination.'' Motta
Veiga said he would not reply to a ``circus helper.''
   -Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral resigned in early October
after the press revealed he was having an affair with Economy
Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello. Cabral accused Rosa e Silva of
plotting behind his back and calling the press spokesman
``worthless.''
   The media observed that Cabral's resignation broke an earlier
pledge by Collor that all his ministers would serve until his term
expired in 1994.
   -Despite official denials, the economy minister's job is also
rumored to be in jeopardy, due to the romantic scandal and slow
progress in bringing inflation down from its current monthly level
of more than 12 percent.
   -Eduardo Cardoso, a Brasilia businessman and also a friend of
Collor, recently received a large loan with generous terms from the
Caixa Economica Federal, the government savings bank. Some charged
it was granted on political grounds.
   So far, negative fallout from the events and rumors seems
largely limited to the small middle class and the
university-educated elite. Most observers say Brazil's poor
majority are far more concerned with bread-and-butter issues than
political intrigue.
   But Luis Eduardo Soares, a political science professor at Rio's
University Research Institute, said: ``Political opinion in Brazil
is largely formed by a very small group. It is exactly those people
who have reacted most negatively to all the current noise.''
   Carlos Castello Branco, the country's most prestigious political
writer, recently noted a ``growing apprehension'' about events
taking place.
   ``The impression being formed is that `New Brazil' is in fact no
more than a remake of `Old Brazil,''' he wrote in a Wednesday
newspaper column.
   Jaguaribe said the government was being ``surrounded by an aura
of corruption'' due to a few bad apples.
   Some analysts say Collor's difficulties have been exaggerated,
however. They note conservatives won major victories in Oct. 3
congressional and gubernatorial elections, greatly strengthening
the president's hand.
   ``Too much significance is given to these court skirmishes,
which are really quite usual,'' said political analyst Sergio
Abranches.

<TEXT>
   When the Israelis jailed Palestinian leader
Faisal Husseini in 1987, he spent much of his 18 months behind bars
teaching himself Hebrew.
   The son of the Palestinians' most famous war hero used his new
language to launch a campaign urging Israelis to back his people's
drive for independent statehood.
   On Thursday, fresh from another spell in jail, Husseini renewed
his appeal, this time in English and his native Arabic.
   ``We are fighting to free our people, not to enslave any other
people,'' he told a crowded news conference in Arab east Jerusalem.
``We are fighting to build our state, not to destroy any other
state.''
   Husseini was arrested Oct. 8 on suspicion of fomenting riots on
the Temple Mount in which Jewish worshipers were stoned and Israeli
gunfire killed at least 19 Palestinians.
   He walked free 17 days later into a new ``circle of blood,'' as
he put it - a wave of Arab attacks on Jews and Jewish vengeance
assaults. He condemned the bloodshed.
   ``There is no difference for me between the crying of a
Palestinian woman who lost her son or the crying of an Israeli
woman who lost her son,'' Husseini said.
   Husseini denies fomenting the Temple Mount violence. He blames
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's government for creating ``a sense
of hopelessness'' among Palestinians by refusing to negotiate peace
and by settling Jews on occupied land that is home to 1.7 million
Palestinians.
   He said Israel's refusal to accept a U.N. probe of the Temple
Mount incident could spur further violence.
   ``If there is no hope, if Israel decides to be outside
international legitimacy ... they are ensuring we will live in a
jungle,'' Husseini said.
   Israel says such an investigation wold challenge its
self-proclaimed sovereignty over Arab Jerusalem.
   An outspoken voice for coexistence, Husseini is recognized by
both Palestinians and Israelis as the Palestine Liberation
Organization's top supporter in Jerusalem, and the political leader
of the 34-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Balding, asthmatic and not given to rousing oratory, 50-year-old
Husseini nonetheless arouses strong emotions in both camps.
   When his name came up during a televised debate Wednesday night,
all four Israeli lawmakers on the panel began talking heatedly at
once.
   Uzi Baram of the opposition Labor Party argued that Husseini
represented Palestinian moderation and that if Israel didn't talk
to him, it might end up having to talk to Hamas, the Moslem
fundamentalist movement.
   But Uzi Landau of the ruling right-wing Likud bloc wouldn't hear
of it. ``The difference between Faisal Husseini and Hamas is
exactly the same as the difference between Saddam Hussein and the
Ayatollah Khomeini,'' he said.
   Arab opinion is divided, too.
   His friend and colleague Sari Nusseibeh says Husseini is a
natural leader ``who feels the responsibility to lead.''
   A recent Islamic fundamentalist tract, however, pounds Husseini
for conducting armchair politics instead of fighting in the
streets.
   Such resentment stems partly from Husseini's high-profile
contacts with Israelis, noteably Yael Dayan, daughter of the late
Israeli war hero Moshe Dayan. They made a joint lecture tour of the
United States this year.
   Husseini was a child of revolution.
   He was born in Baghdad, where his father, Abdul Khader Husseini,
was hiding from the British army for participating in the 1936-39
Arab uprising in what is now Israel. He was 7 when his father died
leading an assault on Israeli troops in the 1948 battle for
Jerusalem.
   Husseini attended universities in Baghdad, Cairo and Beirut, but
never graduated. Later he joined the Palestine Liberation Army, a
military arm of the PLO scattered in the Arab world.
   Husseini thinks his much-revered father would identify with his
activities today, would understand the shift from the battlefield
to the international political arena.
   ``I believe he was fighting starting from his love for his
people, for his land, not starting from hating others,'' Husseini
said.
   The Israelis first arrested Husseini in 1967 after they captured
Arab Jerusalem. Parts of a gun were found in his house, and he
spent the next year in jail.
   In 1987 he was detained without charge for two periods adding up
to 18 months. On Wednesday, he was freed on personal bail, and
police say inquiries continue.

<TEXT>
   Once replaced by a fatter breed of cattle,
the legendary Texas Longhorn is on the comeback trail in grocery
stores as Americans become more health-conscious, cattle raisers
say.
   ``Probably the largest hurdle we have is convincing old-time
cattle raisers they need to change,'' Bill Anthony, president of
the International Texas Longhorn Association, said at the group's
first meeting Thursday.
   Anthony, an Ardmore, Okla. rancher, started raising Longhorns 25
years ago and has fallen in love with the breed.
   ``They are extremely intelligent. You can make housepets out
them if you want.''
   But it's not their intelligence that is putting them back on the
market.
   ``The bottom line is the Longhorn has qualities consumers want
on their dinner plates and the qualities many ranchers are seeking
to develop in their livestock,'' said Mike Moeller, deputy state
agriculture commissioner.
   Moeller said Longhorn beef has 10 percent fat and yields a
greater percentage of lean beef than any other breed. The hardy
breed had been replaced by fatter stock by the turn of the century.
   For cattlemen, Longhorns are a low-maintenance, genetic gold
mine.
   Descended from Spanish cattle brought here centuries ago, the
Longhorn has adapted to severe climates, can forage on poor quality
grass, is resistant to several diseases and produces rich milk.
   When bred with other breeds, the Longhorns cut down on the
number of calving problems, Moeller said.
   Also there is the mystique of raising an animal that helped
create the cowboy and turn the country into a people of beefeaters.
   ``When you have something that has been for so many years of
historical greatness, it's hard not to be fond of Texas Longhorn
cattle,'' Anthony said.
   The first Longhorns were sent out of Texas to New Orleans in the
1840s. A few were driven to Missouri later in that decade. In the
1850s, Longhorns were herded all the way to Chicago.
   But the Civil War intervened and the men who had been driving
cattle took up arms or sold the cattle they raised to armies from
both sides.
   After the war, driving Longhorns to railheads in Kansas became
big business.
   The Texas State Historical Association estimates that 10 million
Longhorns were driven northward on the Chisholm Trail during the
first 25 years after the the Civil War.
   The Longhorn replaced the buffalo as meat for men who were
building the railroads and helping the population move westward.
The huge buffalo herds had been decimated by too much hunting.

   A drug newly approved for fighting a painful and
fertility-threatening condition among millions of women also may
help treat premenstrual syndrome, benign breast tumors and other
ailments, doctors say.
   The drug, Lupron Depot, was approved by the federal Food and
Drug Administration this week for treating endometriosis, a
sometimes painful condition that occurs when tissue lining the womb
migrates to the abdomen and pelvis. If it develops in the ovaries
or fallopian tubes it can cause blocking, scarring and infertility.
   Lupron Depot previously had been approved only for use as a
prostate-cancer medicine, but doctors had for years prescribed it
to women suffering from endometriosis because they knew it worked.
   Insurance companies, however, refused to cover its costs - $252
per monthly injection, typically administered for six months -
because it did not have approval for that use.
   Doctors said this week's OK could also encourage its use in many
other gynecological applications.
   ``These agents (in the same class as Lupron Depot) are clearly
effective for a number of other diseases, such as premenstrual
syndrome, uterine fibroids, and polycystic ovary syndrome,'' said
Dr. Robert L. Barbieri, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at
State University of New York at Stony Brook.
   Premenstrual syndrome is marked by irritability, tension or
depression in possible combination with breast tenderness, fluid
retention and headaches; fibroids by the growth of benign tumors in
the womb; and polycystic ovary syndrome by the growth of cysts in
the ovaries.
   Dr. Edward L. Marut, director of reproductive endocrinology and
infertility at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center in
Chicago, said Lupron Depot also may be useful in treating benign
breast tumors.
   In combatting endometriosis, the drug suppresses production of
the female hormone estrogen, which controls the growth of the
tissue lining the womb, called the endometrium.
   An estimated 2 million to 5 million women have endometriosis. It
is mild or symptom-free in some people but in others it can cause
severe menstrual cramps, pain during sexual intercourse, painful
urination or painful bowel movements.
   Doctors say side effects of Lupron Depot resemble those of
menopause, including hot flashes, but the effects are not permanent
and may be relieved with other medication.
   ``The main downside of the drug is it does cause a low estrogen
state, and it may cause thinning of vertebral bones,'' Barbieri
said. He added that further study will be necessary to determine
whether the amount of bone-thinning is significant.
   ``In essence what we're doing is creating a temporary, medically
induced menopause, a reversible menopause, that, in turn, stops the
stimulation of the endometriosis,'' said Dr. James Miller, medical
director at TAP Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures the drug.
   Barbieri said the only other drug products approved for
endometriosis treatment are Synarel, a nasal spray that has a
similar biological mechanism as Lupron Depot and costs about the
same, and Danazol, a derivative of the male hormone testosterone
that costs about half as much.
   Synarel has the disadvantage of requiring twice daily doses for
six months and being poorly absorbed by the body, he said. Danazol
has the disadvantage of causing women to develop male traits - a
deepening of the voice, facial hair, oilier skin and upper body
muscles.

<TEXT>
   Exuding youth and sex, or worldly chic,
ready-to-wear fashions for summer shown recently offered
split-personality alternatives.
   Will the real Paris fashion world please stand up, observers at
last week's shows are tempted to ask.
   On one hand, there were unabashed, nubile silhouettes molded by
Lycra body stockings, with fancy toppers.
   On the other, Paris still opts for fitted, chic suits and a new
line of looser, fluid dresses and blousons, airy shirt-jackets or
flared tops to keep women of all ages moving in comfort.
   Lacy lingerie inspirations, decolletes, hot pants, navel-baring
bra-and-sarong outfits abound.
   But for the 1990s, there's also a refreshing return to looser
looks in airy, long duster jackets or trapeze coats, or new-looking
billowing party pants. In silky Turkish style, they're done with
panache at both Givenchy - with genteel chic - and Saint Laurent,
with showy glitz.
   Highlights from the collections offer ideas for everybody:
   Claude Montana turned in an outstanding collection of short,
skimpy mini dresses in full, belted coats or modified A-lines. They
came most often in silk fabrics, with hemlines often swooping deep
in the back.
   In white or ivory spangled with silver, or in acidic shades of
pink, yellow and green, Montana's clothes were stunning displays of
talent.
   Statesmen's teen-age daughters, rather than their wives, will
now want to dress at Chanel, as shown by Karl Lagerfeld.
   Youngsters took up his idea of wearing just a long jacket over
tights or leggings, and now Lagerfeld has varied the menu with a
bevy of great jackets, short or long. And they can be worn with
other things than merely tights or pleated minis.
   But winds of change are also blowing for Chanel in new, loose
and easy toppers.
   Christian Lacroix's collection was as vibrantly glowing with
color as ever, with a calculated risk in mixes of plaids and
patterns, brocades, taffetas and chiffons.
   Even the Lacroix solid-color suits with their typical fitted or
flyaway bolerojjackets and straight minis or shaped oval skirts
came in mixes of hot-colored raw silks.
   Like many Paris designers, Lacroix could not resist the call of
the body stocking. He showed some of the liveliest Pucci-style
prints in town on lycra bodysuits and easy shirt-jackets.
   Ungaro's flowery extravaganza went both new in style with his
blousing chemise dresses and typically Ungaro sexy in style with
fitted, draped late-day wear. He also offered a fine array of
less-constricting dresses with jackets or suits - typical of this
great tailor.
   Jean-Louis Scherrer, the animal-lover whose star model and
daughter Laetitia also hosts a weekend TV wildlife show, brought
out his panoply of jungle and wild-animal prints in clothes fitted
and loose.
   Nearly everyone from Saint Laurent to Guy Laroche and Scherrer
showed impeccable yet individual mariner styles in navy, white and
sometimes red.
   Safari or bush jackets are another favorite, along with a welter
of well-cut long and tailored or slim pants to vie with the
bodysuits, hot pants and wider, flaring shorts in 1930s style.
   There is hope for those who wish for longer skirts, as women
still wear them on the streets, even in Paris. A few new versions
in slim or flared mid-calf skirts crept in at Saint Laurent, Sonia
Rykiel and Kenzo.
   Fabrics to watch for spring and summer are on the light side:
lightweight gabardine and broadcloth or cashmere blends come out in
spring coats and suits.
   Colors run the gamut, with plenty of navy and white in classic
daytime wear. There is heavy emphasis on reds and pinks from smoky
and tea rose to mandarin orange, Day-Glo or shocking pink.

   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) - Yemen, a nation born only five months ago
from the merger of North and South Yemen, is already at odds with
its powerful neighbor, Saudi Arabia.
   More than 400,000 Yemenis have left Saudi Arabia in the past
five weeks, in what Yemen's foreign minister says is a Saudi bid to
cripple its fledgling government.
   The foreign minister, Abd al-Karim al-Iryani, said Saudi
pressure was not over Yemen's support for Iraq but rather
territorial claims and other issues.
   He said Saudi Arabia had already complained officially that
Yemen would not move ``on certain aspects of our relationship''
which Iryani described as boundaries in a potentially oil-rich
quarter.
   The two Yemens united on May 22, raising old border issues
predating the establishment of Saudi Arabia in the 1930s.
   The Saudis hoped that Yemen would be overwhelmed by the deluge
of refugees, Iryani said. Also, the remittances from Yemenis in
Saudi Arabia had made up a third of the gross national product, so
the Saudi move was a financial blow.
   ``We are easily reabsorbing 400,000 people,'' Iryani said.
``There will be difficulties, of course, but we will not go down
the drain as the Saudis wish us to do.''
   On Sept. 18, Saudi authorities withdrew special status for the 1
million to 2 million Yemenis in the kingdom, many of whom had been
residents for more than 30 years. They were given a month to find a
Saudi sponsor or go home.
   On Tuesday, the Saudis extended the deadline by a month.
   ``We are simply saying that all foreigners are created equal,''
a senior Saudi official told The Associated Press on Monday. ``Why
should we give them special treatment when they turn on us?''
   Iryani dismissed as ``malicious nonsense'' what he called
Saudi-inspired rumors that Saddam Hussein had promised Yemen the
disputed Asir region or that Iraqi missiles were installed here.
   Yemen condemned the invasion of Kuwait, he said, and objected
only to non-Arab troops in the region.
   He said Yemen abstained on crucial Security Council votes
against Saddam because its envoy was awaiting word from the Arab
League.
   ``Yemen never took a firm stand in support of Iraq,'' he said.
Yemen, like Jordan, argued that Saddam should be pushed out of
Kuwait - but not by hardening his position with a Western presence.
   ``The Saudis expected us to toe the line without question,''
Iryani complained.
   He acknowledged that Saudi Arabia had committed $100 million a
year in budgetary support and had made major concessions to Yemen.
   ``We are not denying they have done very well in helping Yemen,
but to what end do you want to help?'' he said.
   ``Quite clearly, we have discovered it was not for simple
neighborliness, common faith, common destiny. Apparently, it was
intended for something else.''
   Western diplomats in San`a estimate the returnees at about
350,000. One, who had toured the border area, said he saw no sign
that Saudi authorities had prevented them from selling their
holdings and bringing out property.
   ``It looks like they can absorb 400,000 without too much
trouble,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``But what happens if it goes to a million?''
   The Saudis dispute the 350,000 figure as inflated.
   Iryani estimated that Yemen's economy would taken up to three
years to recover from the shock but would emerge stronger as a
result. The main hope, he said, is oil.
   Hunt Consolidated Inc. of Dallas is already producing 210,000
barrels a day near Marib at the southern end of the empty quarter.
Recently, Saudi engineers reported a find in the south that might
increase their reserves by 20 percent.
   That, Iryani said, was the heart of the dispute.
   ``If there is oil to the south and oil to the north, it is
likely there is oil in the middle.''

<HEAD>Death Toll Reaches 89 in Hindu-Moslem Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The religious dispute that pits Hindus
against Moslems is threatening to bring down the government, and
the death toll in the violence has risen to 89, according to news
reports today.
   United News of India reported that 71 people died Wednesday and
Thursday in religious riots in the cities of Jaipur and Jodhpur in
western Rajasthan state.
   The news agency quoted hospital sources as saying 68 bodies of
people killed in the rioting had been brought to Jaipur, and at
least three other people were known to have died.
   Elsewhere in the country, news reports said that at least 18
others had died in Hindu-Moslem clashes since Tuesday when the
leader of a right-wing Hindu party was arrested.
   Lal Krishna Advani was detained while leading a caravan across
northern Indian to rally support for a campaign to replace a 16th
century Moslem mosque with a Hindu temple in the Uttar Pradesh city
of Ayodhya. Hindus claim the mosque, built in 1528, is on the site
of the birthplace of Lord Rama, and thus is as holy to Hindus as
Mecca is to Moslems.
   The arrest of Advani, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party,
triggered riots in a half-dozen states where large Moslem
communities are mingled among the Hindu majority.
   As many as 50,000 supporters of Advani's party have been placed
under ``preventive arrest'' over the past two weeks. Indian law
allows people to be detained without charges when authorities fear
there is a threat to public safety.
   After Advani's arrest, his party withdrew its support for
Singh's coalition government, plunging India into a political
crisis. The party's defection deprived Singh of a parliamentary
majority.
   Singh said he would seek a vote of confidence on Nov. 7 to prove
he could still muster a parliamentary majority.
   But the Congress Party, the largest opposition party, said it
would oppose Singh in any vote of confidence because of his
handling of the religious dispute.
   Within Singh's fractious Janata Dal party, there appeared to be
moves under way to oust him as party leader.
   The Times of India newspaper reported a concerted effort in top
party circles to replace Singh so Janata Dal could remain in power.
   The national daily said smaller parties in the government
coalition had indicated they ``would not be adverse to support a
government minus V.P. Singh ... if it can spare the nation travails
of another parliamentary poll within a year.''
   Singh's Janata Dal party and smaller partners in his National
Front coalition government now hold 146 seats in the 522-member
policy-making lower house - the Lok Sabha, or House of the People.
   He still has the support of the Communist-led Left Front
alliance, which has 51 seats, but the loss of the 86 seats held by
the Bharatiya Janata Party has cost him his majority.
   The opposition Congress Party and its allies hold 210 seats. The
remainder are held by smaller parties and independents.
   The political crisis was triggered by a religious dispute over a
shrine in Ayodhya, a town of 40,000 in Uttar Pradesh.
   Tens of thousands of Hindus have converged on Ayodhya this week
to help build the temple. The government has dispatched tens of
thousands of police and paramilitary troops to prevent violent
clashes.
   Singh and his Janata Dal party allies who run Uttar Pradesh's
state government have tried to halt construction of the temple
until a court can rule on the religious dispute.
   Moslems comprise only 12 percent of India's 880 million people.
India is officially a secular state, but the Hindus make up 82
percent of the population and dominate the government.

<HEAD>Senate Grills Industry, Administration Officials On Oil Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administration energy expert says consumers
can expect the price of gasoline to hover between $1.30 and $1.62
over the next year, that is if no war breaks out in the Persian
Gulf.
   U.S. Energy Information Administrator Calvin Kent also told a
Senate panel Thursday to expect home heating oil prices to range
between $1.13 and $1.45 per gallon through 1991, roughly equal to
the high levels heating oil reached in last winter's cold snap.
   Kent's forecast came in the opening session of a three-day
hearing on why oil prices shoot up on the slightest rumor of
trouble in the Mideast but don't seem to come down on rumors of
peace.
   Kent told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that an
improvement in the Mideast situation might lower the price of crude
oil, but an immediate response at the gasoline pump shouldn't be
expected.
   ``Prices go up more quickly than they come down,'' Kent said.
   Kent's price estimates assume that the Persian Gulf crisis does
not dissolve into war, that the winter is normal in severity and
that market factors such as inventories and daily oil production
remain relatively stable.
   Also assumed in his forecast was that crude oil remains at about
$30 per barrel. That assumption seemed open to question even as he
testified; in New York's mercantile exchange oil jumped $3.17 per
barrel in early trading to $34.25 by mid day.

his office.
   A spokesman said Rep. Raymond McGrath, a Republican, was
admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center Thursday.
   ``He felt faint. He broke out in a sweat. He said he felt a
heaviness in the chest - not pain,'' said Dan Zielinski. ``He was

<HEAD>Survey: Majority of Catholics Oppose Bishops' Political
Involvement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large majority of Roman Catholics oppose the
involvement of U.S. bishops in abortion politics, according to a
survey released by a private group of Catholics.
   The poll commissioned by Catholics for a Free Choice found that
71 percent of Catholics and 74 percent of all respondents said
Catholic bishops should not ``use the political arena to advance
their moral opinions.'' Results of the survey were made public.
   ``What we find is that Catholics and non-Catholics are opposed
to the style and approach the bishops are taking on abortion
politics,'' Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free
Choice, said at a news conference.
   Helen Alvare, public information director at the pro-life office
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, disagreed with the
results of the survey.
   ``It promotes the idea that the bishops shouldn't speak out on
the human rights issue of abortion,'' she said. ``It would prefer
to gag us as moral leaders in the public square.
   ``In fact, the bishops won't be silenced on any human rights
issue, including things like economic justice, civil rights or
abortion,'' Alvare said, contending that most of the poll questions
involved the church's getting involved in elections, ``which we
don't do.''
   She also said the survey did not distinguish between regular
churchgoing Catholics and Catholics who don't go to church
regularly.
   Kissling said the U.S. Catholic Conference and a number of
bishops were inappropriately participating in the political process
by attacking individual candidates and elected officials whose
views on abortion differ from theirs.

<HEAD>Female Deserter a Male And Ready for Duty, Army Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army reservist that military officials
mistakenly listed as a deserter and a female is neither.
   Pfc. Lavern Fay Johnson is willing to serve. And he's a man.
   Army officials said Thursday they mistakenly identified Johnson,
26, of Bluford, as a female deserter Wednesday while discussing the
case of Spec. Stephanie Atkinson of Murphysboro.
   Atkinson, who has refused to report for duty with the 300th
Adjutant Postal Company, says she has become a concientious
objector and opposes the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Someone erred,'' said the Army's Fort Sheridan spokesman, Maj.
Bob Host. ``He has been removed from the classification of
deserter.''
   Army officials said they discovered the mistake Thursday while
looking up more information on Johnson in response to a reporter's
questions.
   Johnson, who was working with a carnival in Florida, couldn't be
reached for comment. But his mother, Dorothy Johnson, said he had
already made plans to report for duty and had been told to ``stay
put'' until he was needed.
   ``He said some time ago that if his unit went to Saudi Arabia,
he would go,'' his mother said. ``His younger brother already is
over there in the Army.''
   She said she hadn't been told about the mix-up involving her
son, but was glad to hear it had been resolved.

<HEAD>Once America's Largest Newspaper, Daily News Strength Had Eroded</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Daily News, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News, once America's largest
newspaper, has seen its circulation and financial stability slowly
erode in recent decades.
   The tabloid slipped to being the nation's second largest
metropolitan daily this year, giving up the top spot to the Los
Angeles Times. Before the strike called Thursday, circulation stood
at 1.18 million on weekdays and 1.46 million on Sunday.
   The Daily News first went to print in 1919 as the Illustrated
Daily News, founded by late publisher Joseph Medill Paterson. It
billed itself as ``New York's Picture Newspaper,'' a slogan that
still appears on the masthead.
   It gained a reputation as a feisty tabloid, specializing in
crime stories, exposes and colorful local features.
   In 1928, one of the most gruesome but spectacular newspaper
pictures ever published was the paper's front-page shot of Ruth
Snyder in Sing Sing prison's electric chair as she was executed for
the murder of her husband.
   The photo was snapped secretly by a photographer with a camera
strapped to his leg and smuggled out under the noses of prison
officials.
   When President Ford decided not to bail New York City out of its
fiscal crisis in 1975, the News published one of its most famous
headlines: ``Ford To City: Drop Dead.''
   Circulation reached its zenith in the years after World War II
when it sold 2.4 million copies on weekdays and 4.7 million on
Sundays, the largest ever for a U.S. newspaper.
   Like many of its competitors, the paper began to experience
harder times. Television lured people away and blue-collar workers
formerly loyal to the Daily News began to move out of the city and
turned to suburban newspapers.
   Along the way such notable New York dailies as the Herald
Tribune, the Sun, the World-Telegram, the Journal-American and the
Daily Mirror folded. The News survived along with the New York Post
and The New York Times.
   In 1980, the paper embarked on a disastrous attempt to lure
afternoon readers away from the Post with an evening paper called
Tonight. The experiment folded after one year.
   By the end of 1981, the News was offered for sale by its owner,
Chicago-based Tribune Co., but no buyer surfaced and the paper
struggled on through various cost-cutting efforts.
   Unions representing most of the News's 3,500 employees have been
locked in bitter negotiations with management since January. The
News claims losses of $115 million from 1979 to 1989 on revenues of
$4 billion.
   Management says it needs to eliminate featherbedding and other
alleged labor abuses and save $50 million to $70 million annually
so that it can invest $500 million in new color presses to remain
competitive.
   The Allied Printing Trades Council, an umbrella group of 10
unions at the News, says the Tribune Co. is really interested in
making the paper lean enough to interest a buyer, or it will shut
down the paper.
   By destroying the unions first, the paper would save $100
million in shutdown costs, union leaders say.
   Central to the negotiations has been the News' determination to
give management broad powers over staffing levels, work rules and
other areas of operations now controlled largely by the unions.
   George McDonald, head of the Allied, has said the unions will
never agree to the management rights concept.
   During the past few months, the News has been preparing to print
and deliver the paper without its union workers, recruiting
replacement workers and training management in various areas of the
paper's operations.

   The dollar rose against most major foreign
currencies today in early European trading. Gold prices rose on the
back of robust world oil prices and persistent jitters over a
possible military flare-up in the Persian Gulf.
   One Frankfurt dealer said expectations of a resolution in the
U.S. budget talks might spur more speculation of U.S. interest
rates easing next week.
   To a growing extent, however, the expectation of lower rates has
already been factored into the dollar's current weakness, the
dealer said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.35 yen to a closing 128.50 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 128.20 yen.

   Police opened fire to break up
protests and black factions clashed in several towns, leaving nine
blacks dead and scores wounded, police said today.
   Five blacks were killed Thursday and about 80 injured in battles
with riot police in Khayelitsha township outside Cape Town after
police broke up a march with shotgun fire, police said. It was not
clear how many died from police bullets.
   Clashes continued Thursday night, with police shooting at youths
who erected barricades to block streets. At least 50 shacks were
burned, but no other casualties were immediately reported.
   Residents said the area remained tense today and that heavily
armed police units roamed the township.
   The independent South African Press Association and several
newspapers reported seven people had been killed in the clashes.
Police denied the reports.
   A police statement today said four people were killed in black
factional fighting in Natal Province during the previous 24 hours.
   A group of blacks with rifles attacked a house at Ntzuma,
killing two men and wounding a woman, the statement said. Two black
men were killed at Mnjamda, but police gave no details.
   Three blacks were hurt late Thursday in Pretoria when passengers
jumped out of a moving train after men with whips attacked people,
police said.
   Police said the attackers were trying to enforce a work boycott.
They said they had no details of the boycott.
   Tension has been high in Khayelitsha since the slaying last week
of Momsa Mapongwana, the wife of an anti-apartheid leader in the
township. There have been no claims of responsibility or arrests in
the slaying.
   Violence broke out Thursday when an explosion started a fire at
the town council building, police said. They said the blast could
have been caused by a limpet mine.
   Many residents of black townships oppose the local councils and
consider council members collaborators with the white-led
government.
   Firefighters put out the blaze, but police said township
residents began hurling stones at officers, who then fired tear
gas, rubber bullets and birdshot.
   Maj. Gen. Flip Fourie said police initially did not object to
the march Thursday.
   ``But when extensive damage was done to the (town council)
offices in an explosion and thousands of residents started
gathering in the streets at 4 a.m., stoning cars, erecting burning
barricades and torching vehicles, we had to act,'' Fourie said.
   Witnesses said police declared the march illegal and gave people
a minute to disperse. Some marchers began walking toward police
with their hands up, making peace symbols with their fingers, and
police began shooting, the witnesses alleged.

<HEAD>Negotiators Clear Egypt Debt Relief, Salvador Aid Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators agreed early
today on a $15.5 billion foreign aid bill for the coming year that
will set a new U.S. policy direction in El Salvador and forgive
Egypt's military debt to the United States.
   Accord came after a marathon, and at times stormy, all-night
bargaining session that hinged on the administration's swallowing a
50 percent cut in military aid to El Salvador in return for the
$6.7 billion debt relief for Egypt, which President Bush badly
wanted.
   The compromise package now goes back to the full House and
Senate for ratification before going to Bush, whose advisers have
threatened a veto over the El Salvador provisions.
   Administration officials have said erasing Egypt's past military
debt from the books is crucial to maintaining the international
coalition that has been built against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   ``The entire U.S. and world position against (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein and Iraq will be at risk'' if the debt were not
forgiven as Bush promised, said Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., the
senior GOP member of the Senate Appropriations foreign aid
subcommittee.
   But House subcommittee Chairman David Obey, D-Wis., countered
that he would have difficulty winning votes for the bill in the
House if it fully forgives Egypt's debt. And he complained heatedly
that Bush made the promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
without first consulting lawmakers.
   The El Salvador provision calls for an immediate 50 percent cut
in this year's $85 million in military aid as a step toward
creating incentives for the San Salvador government and the leftist
FMLN rebels to end their decade-long civil war with a negotiated
political settlement.
   If the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
walk away from U.N.-sponsored peace talks, the aid could be
restored. But if the government fails to pursue peace, it could
lose the other half of its military aid.
   The arrangement represents a major change in U.S. policy toward
El Salvador, which has received aid at a rate of nearly $1 million
a day in recent years. It also was a victory for congressional
opponents of administration policy, who are weary of 10 years of
aid that has done little to encourage moderation in the Central
American country.
   In other provisions, the bill pointedly omits any specific
earmark for Pakistan, which in past years has been the
third-largest recipient of U.S. aid. In fact, it erects new hurdles
before aid can be granted, including certification that this week's
elections were free and fair and restoration of full civil
liberties in the country.
   In the past, Pakistan has been particularly important because of
its role in supplying anti-communist rebels in neighboring
Afghanistan. The United States has looked the other way when
Pakistan advanced its nuclear weapons program. But with U.S.
participation in that war winding down, Congress is taking a more
critical look at the aid.
   As usual, Israel is the top beneficiary of the bill with some $3
billion in cash military and economic aid, and millions more in
non-cash benefits. The conferees agreed to include a section that
would let the United States give Israel up to $700 million worth of
new weaponry from Pentagon stocks.
   In addition to the debt forgiveness, Egypt is the second-largest
cash aid recipient, with $2.1 billion. The money for the two Middle
Eastern countries stems from their Camp David peace accord and
their status as staunch U.S. allies in the region.
   The bill provides a total of $3.1 billion for economic aid and
$4.6 billion for military aid. Congress is giving the
administration more latitude than usual to decide how to distribute
the money.
   But lawmakers did include specific earmarks for several favored
countries: Jordan, $35 million in economic aid; Morocco, $20
million in economic and $43 million in military aid; Greece, $350
million in military aid; Turkey, $500 million in military aid; and
$62.5 million in economic aid for Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.
   The bill also includes $800 million for sub-Saharan Africa, $7.5
million for Lebanon, $20 million for Ireland, $364 million for
Eastern Europe and up to $20 million for humanitarian and
development aid in Cambodia.
   The Philippines would get $160 million for this year's payment
on a five-year, $1 billion aid program called the Multilateral
Assistance Initiative. That is $40 million less than the
administration had asked, and the same as last year's amount.

<HEAD>100-Year-Old Woman Favors Driver's Seat Over Rocking Chair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jessie Fiedler just turned 100 and
she'd rather sit in a driver's seat than a rocking chair.
   ``Driving is one of my pleasures in life,'' said Fiedler, who
hit the century mark Thursday. ``It keeps me young and interested
in life.''
   Her driver's license expires in 1992.
   ``Of course I plan to renew it,'' she said.
   ``If I had to sit in a rocking chair all day, I'd feel
pathetic,'' she said Wednesday after taking a pre-birthday drive
around the block in her 1980 Buick Century. ``I always say it's
better to wear out than to rust out.''
   Fiedler's brother taught her how to drive on a Sunday afternoon
when they were growing up in Uniontown, Pa., and she was ``driving
the next day.'' She admits she wasn't a very good driver at first
but said her few accidents were usually ``the other fellow's
fault.''
   Age has improved her driving, Fiedler said.
   ``When you practice for a lot of years, you'd have to get
better,'' she said. ``I had my car insurance reduced because I've
been a safe driver. That's good for a 100-year-old.''

<HEAD>Parliament Chamber Votes To End State Monopoly on Mail and Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lower house of Parliament today voted
to abolish the government's monopoly on radio, TV, telephones and
postal services, which would formally open the door to private
ventures in those sectors.
   The law was approved by the Sejm on a vote of 256 to 1 with five
abstentions. It must still be passed by the Senate and signed by
President Wojciech Jaruzelski, but approval was expected.
   The move is another step in the former Communist country's
free-market reform program that began the first of the year.
   Private radio stations and at least one TV station already have
been functioning during the past year with the official
acquiescence while the new legislation was being drafted.
   The new law allows for the assigning of specific broadcasting
frequencies to licensees under the supervision of the Ministry of
Communications.
   It would end the government's legal monopoly over postal
services, telecommunications, radio and television.
   Before passage, the Sejm accepted one amendment to limit radio
frequencies assigned to military and police. Before whole sections
of the wave spectrum were assigned to these units, but now they
will be limited to specific channels.
   Several foreign companies have expressed interest in helping to
establish a third commercial TV channel in Poland, in addition to
the two government-owned channels currently operating.

<HEAD>Planetary Lineup Spurs Early Suspension of Magellan's Mapping
Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA decided to suspend the Magellan
spacecraft's Venus map-making mission today, three days earlier
than planned, because a planetary lineup is affecting its
navigation and communications with Earth.
   It will be at least 12 days before Magellan can resume its $744
million mission to use radar to make pictures and maps of
cloud-covered Venus, said Jim Scott, mission director at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The space agency had planned to halt mapping by Magellan for
nine days starting Monday.
   But laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle said increasing difficulty
with Magellan's navigation, communications with Earth, solar panels
and ability to make quality pictures prompted the decision to
suspend operations today.
   Scott said the problems may stem from an astronomical event
called ``superior conjunction.''
   That occurs next Thursday when Venus and Earth are at their
maximum distance from each other - about 161 million miles - and
the sun lies almost directly between the two planets.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989. It went into orbit around Venus 2{ months ago, and started
mapping Venus full-time Sept. 15.
   So far, its radar pictures have shown extensive quake faults, a
wide variety of volcanos and lava flows, Los Angeles-sized
meteorite impact craters and 600-mile-wide bulges that are like the
``hot spots'' on Earth's crust that created Hawaii.

<TEXT>
   A church plans to burn books by Moslems and
Jehovah's Witnesses along with pornography and ``satanic
paraphernalia'' on Saturday in what the church's pastor hopes will
become an annual event.
   ``Our purpose is to rid our city - and throughout the years
we'll continue to rid our city - of more satanic paraphernalia, and
then we believe the Holy Spirit will have a greater freedom to
flow,'' the Rev. Donovan Larkins, founder of the non-denominational
Victory Bible Church, said Thursday.
   The church distributed fliers in several neighborhoods this week
inviting people to bring in books by Moslems and Jehovah's
Witnesses; books on New Age religions, witchcraft, yoga,
transcendental meditation and Christian Science; horoscopes;
playing cards; and ``secular albums, tapes and bumper stickers.''
   Larkins said he doesn't care if his bonfire offends everyone in
the city.
   ``What God says is what's important to me,'' he said.
   He suggested that anyone who wonders why items from other
religions were chosen should ``come to our church ... so that we
can expound to them the unadulterated word of God.''

<HEAD>Heart Attack Victim Dragged Out of Store After Owner Thought He Was
Drunk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who suffered a fatal heart attack was
dragged out of a grocery market on his stomach when the store
manager mistook his semiconscious condition for drunkeness.
   B&amp;M Market cashier Charelle M. White said the man was left
outside for 20 minutes Thursday morning before paramedics were
called. The victim, identified as James Drumright, 57, of
Baltimore, died at Liberty Medical Center.
   Paramedics said they couldn't determine if Drumright would have
lived had he received medical assistance sooner.
   Police said a community relations officer and members of the
group Alliance of Rosemont Community Organizations planned to
investigate.
   Alliance president Leslie C. Howard said the incident could
inflame racial tensions because the store's owners are Korean and
the victim was black.
   Many Korean store owners operate in predominantly black
neighborhoods in Baltimore, and cultural differences have caused
misunderstandings. Several storekeepers have been the targets of
violence.
   In New York City, blacks have been demonstrating since early
this year over an incident in Brooklyn, where a black woman claimed
she was roughed up by a Korean store worker.
   Several angry passersby stayed at the B&amp;M Market until late
Thursday, urging people not to shop there.
   ``If we had any idea he had had a heart attack, we would have
called the paramedics,'' said the store's owner, Kenny Kang.
   ``I feel bad now, but I thought he was drunk,'' said store
manager Marcus Gaffney, who helped drag the man outside.
   Gaffney said a shopper told him the man was slumped over a meat
case in the back of the market. When he went to investigate, he
said he saw a liquor bottle poking out of the man's back pocket.
   White said Kang told Gaffney and another employee to drag the
man outside.

<HEAD>Human Hair Grown in Test-Tube Could Lead to Cure for Baldness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human hair has been grown in a test tube for the
first time, and the discovery could lead to a cure for baldness by
the year 2000, a Cambridge University scientist said today.
   ``This is the real thing,'' said Dr. Terence Kealey, leader of
the research team at the Department of Clinical Biochemistry. ``We
have for the first time succeeded in getting hair to grow in
vitro.''
   The balding scientist stressed in a BBC radio interview that
growing hairs in a test tube ``is not in itself a cure for
baldness,'' but it does provide the perfect arena for experiments.
   The next step, he said, is to find out why the normal
``kickback'' mechanism that triggers the growth of new hair when
existing hair follicles come to the end of their normal growth
cycle stops working in many middle-aged men.
   ``I hope that within 10 years we could come up with a cure for
baldness,'' he said.
   He said the successful growth of test-tube hair came after a
team member, Dr. Michael Philpott, devised a method for extracting
hair follicles from the skin without damaging the hair roots.
   The two top layers of skin have to be carefully sliced away
before removing the follicles with fine tweezers, he said. The
follicles are then grown in a synthetic blood substitute maintained
at body temperature.
   Watching human hair growing in a test tube is ``an amazing
sight,'' Kealey said. ``It grows absolutely identical to normal
hairs - at the same rate of 0.012 inches a day and in the same
shape.''
   He said his team will now expose the test-tube hair to a variety
of different biological materials and observe the results.
   The team's research, funded by the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant
Unilever and Britain's Science and Engineering Research Council,
will be published in next month's issue of the Journal of Cell
Science.
   Kealey said the research could also produce a much more
effective depilatory for women to remove unwanted hair.
   He explained that hairs grow for about two years and then
spontaneously shed. ``If you can promote ... that process up, you
have a natural depilatory,'' he said.
   ``In fact what we can do now in the laboratory is persuade hairs
to shed in this very natural manner and so we hope that we might
quite quickly start trying to work on improved depilatories as well
as a cure for baldness.''
   Cambridge is known for its scientific breakthroughs, including
discoveries of the electron, the neutron and the structure of DNA,
the building blocks of genetic material.
   Asked how the test-tube hair compared with the other scientific
breakthroughs, Kealey replied:
   ``We're absolutely thrilled to have made this breakthrough, but
I think honestly as an intellectual breakthrough, it has to be
viewed as rather trivial. I am myself bald, but I don't think it's
something that bothers me very much.''
   But Kealey added: ``One has to be fairly catholic and understand
that for many people it is intensely traumatic - maybe because it
is the first visible sign of advancing age.''

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived today for a
three-day visit to Spain intended to drum up support for his
country's troubled economy.
   The trip is the Soviet leader's first abroad since he was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Oct. 15 and is the first by a
Soviet head of state to Spain.
   The Soviet president and his wife, Raisa, were greeted by Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez at Madrid's airport. King Juan Carlos was
hosting an official welcoming ceremony at the palace.
   Soviet flags lined Madrid's main avenues, and large crowds
turned out to try to catch a glimpse of the Gorbachevs.
   In an interview published today in Spain's largest daily El
Pais, Gorbachev hailed growing U.S.-Soviet cooperation.
   ``We believe we're at the start of a long and stable period of
normal, strong and equal relations,'' he was quoted as saying.
   ``It fills us with hope that these relations have already passed
the tests of the dramatic events of Eastern Europe, and the first
serious international crisis since since the end of the Cold War in
the Persian Gulf, which has not perturbed, but strengthened
Soviet-U.S. cooperation,'' Gorbachev told the newspaper.
   ``This indicates we have found the key to common efforts to
create a safer and more just world order,'' he added.
   The trip to Spain, where Gorbachev is widely admired, provides a
welcome break from the growing economic problems and nationalist
tensions at home.
   On the eve of the visit, the Soviet central Asian republic of
Kazakhstan because the latest republic to declare its sovereignty
from Moscow.
   After protracted debate, the Soviet Parliament this month
approved Gorbachev's plan to switch from a centrally planned to a
market economy, a move that could exacerbate problems in the short
run.
   Gorbachev, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, was to meet with parliamentarians, receive two
honorary degrees and meet business leaders in Madrid and Barcelona.
   The Soviet entourage included about 40 top political, economic
and cultural figures.
   Gorbachev and Gonzalez were expected to sign up to a dozen
accords aimed at boosting trade, investment and strengthening
bilateral relations.
   Officials of the two countries were negotiating an agreement
under which Spain would extend to the Soviets a $1.5 billion line
of credit to buy Spanish goods and technology. Spanish-Soviet trade
totaled about $2 billion last year, 70 percent of it in Soviet
crude oil exports.
   Gonzalez and Gorbachev were to sign a joint political statement
covering what Gorbachev called coinciding views on a wide range of
European and international issues.
   The Soviet president was to leave to Paris on Sunday.

   The republic of Moldavia today declared a state of
emergency in its restive southern region, and Kazakhstan has become
the 14th of the 15 Soviet republics to declare sovereignty, Soviet
media reported.
   In its sovreignty declaration Thursday, Kazakhstan defied the
national legislature and banned nuclear tets on its territory.
   Environmental activists in the Central Asian republic claim its
15 million people suffer an elevated cancer rate and other health
problems because it is the site of one of the country's main
testing grounds for nuclear warheads.
   In Moldavia, which borders Romania, authorities imposed a state
of emergency in the Gagauz region, where an ethnic minority has
declared sovereignty and begun holding elections.
   Moldavia's parliament also voted to abolish local governments in
the region and replace them with committees appointed by the
republic, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   Movement in and out of the region was restricted and public
rallies and other meetings banned, the news agency said. The state
of emergency will be enforced by Soviet Interior Ministry troops
under the control of officials in the republic, it said.
   Busloads of college-age volunteers were also headed for the area
today. Konstantin Rabu, a member of the Moldavian People's Front,
said in a telephone interview from the Moldavian capital of
Kishinev that the volunteers were unarmed and would try to end the
Gagauz independence drive peacefully.
   ``We want to talk them out of this craziness,'' he said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a telephone call to
Moldavia's president, Mircha Snegur, to warn that ``violence and
confrontation are impermissible,'' Tass said.
   About 150,000 Gagauz, who are of Turkish descent, live in
Moldavia and make up 3 percent of the population.
   The chairman of Moldavia's parliament, Alexander Moshanu, made a
televised appeal Thursday night for ``maximum restraint, calm and
tolerance to prevent clashes between volunteers and the Gagauz
people.''
   Militants on both sides are ready to ``cast us into the abyss of
violence,'' he said.
   Kazakhstan's parliament ordered a halt to all nuclear testing on
its territory, stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Chinese
border, the independent Interfax news agency reported.
   With Kazakhstan's sovreignty call, the only republic that has
not declared sovereignty from the central Soviet government is
Kirgizia. The republic is a mountainous region in Central Asia with
4.2 million people, about half of whom are ethnic Kirgiz and
predominately Moslem.
   The Kirgiz parliament is debating the issue and is likely to
take the step soon, the republic's most famous native son, writer
and Presidential Council member Chingiz Aitmatov, said in an
interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday.
   The accelerating breakaway of the republics, which began with
Lithuania's declaration of independence on March 11, has plunged
the Soviet government into a constitutional crisis.
   The national legislature passed legislation Wednesday saying its
laws take precedence over decisions by parliaments in each
republic. But the republics have shown no intention of complying.
   Kazakhstan's parliament said its decisions would hold sway in
cases of conflict with national laws, and it claimed control over
the republic's natural resources, Interfax reported.
   Gorbachev has been trying to persuade the republics to negotiate
a new treaty that would redefine and preserve the union as a
confederation of sovereign states.
   Kazakh lawmakers have indicated willingness to join such a
confederation. But the leaders of many republics have been
reluctant to participate, and negotiations have yet to begin in
earnest.
   While the republics are pushing for autonomy from the central
government in Moscow, some also are simultaneously trying to stop
separatist movements in smaller regions inside their territory.
   Moldavia faces independence movements not only by the Gagauz,
but also by a smaller number of ethnic Ukrainians in another corner
of the republic, the so-called Dneister republic.
   The huge Russian Federation faces separatist movements from
Finnish-speaking people in the northern Komi Autonomous Republic
and from the Chuvash, a region of 1.3 million people along the
Volga River. It is the largest of the Soviet republics with about
two-thirds of the nation's land mass and half the country's
population.
   On Wednesday, the Chuvash parliament declared itself a full
Soviet republic. The central government and 15 recognized republics
have not recognized the claim.
   In Georgia, fighting has broken out between the mostly Christian
majority and the Moslem minority in Abkhazia, a region of about
500,000 people along the Black Sea.
   Azerbaijan also has been fighting for two years to retain
control of Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave of ethnic Armenians. On
Thursday, Tass reported that Soviet Interior Ministry officials
were taken hostage by people demanding the release of Armenians
detained in a passport check. The agency did not say how many
hostages were involved.

   Police today identified the body of a man killed
when he was turned into a ``human bomb'' by the IRA as a
42-year-old handyman who worked for the Defense Ministry.
   Patrick Gillespie was killed Wednesday when IRA gunmen held his
family hostage and forced him to drive a vehicle laden with a
1,000-pound bomb into a military checkpoint near Londonderry,
Northern Ireland's second city.
   Five soldiers also died in that blast and a sixth soldier was
killed in a simultanous bomb attack at Newry, 100 miles southeast
of Londonderry.
   In London, meawhile, six months of negotiations between Britain
and the Irish Republic aimed at restoring local government to
British-ruled Northern Ireland ended in deadlock late Thursday.
   British and Irish officials told a news conference they would
try to overcome differences, but the outlook was bleak.
   ``We have gone as far as we can - and that is generally
accepted. The situation is somber,'' Irish Foreign Minister Gerry
Collins told reporters.
   The officials said the main sticking point was when the Irish
government should become involved in the negotiations between
Northern Ireland's Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders.
   The Irish Republic wants to be involved at every stage, while
the Protestants, who are the majority in Northern Ireland, envision
a role for Dublin only at the last stages.
   Collins and Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke, Britain's
top official in the province, also condemned Wednesday's IRA
violence.
   In a joint communique, they expressed ``absolute abhorrence of
the appalling inhumanity involved in the coercion of human victims
to deliver bombs to the point of attack.''
   Thirty-five people were injured, including a 65-year-old man
forced to drive the bomb-laden car in Newry. It was the most deadly
Irish Republican Army attack in Northern Ireland in two years.
   A third attempted bomb attack at a British army base near Omagh,
55 miles west of Belfast failed when the bomb did not go off.
   Gerry Kelly, the Roman Catholic man forced to drive that
vehicle, said he was convinced he would die when IRA men strapped
him in the seat and followed him to the Sherwood Foresters military
base.
   ``The sweat was dribbling down my face. All sorts of things were
going through my mind and I thought this was it,'' Kelly said
Thursday.
   He said his IRA kidnappers told him the explosives were attached
to a 40-minute timer. ``They said, `Don't do anything stupid, we
have a rifle trained on you,' '' Kelly said.
   In new violence today, a railway line between Newry and Dundalk
in Northern Ireland was closed after reports of an explosion,
police said.
   The IRA is fighting to unite Protestant-dominated Northern
Ireland with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   The IRA is banned on both sides of the border.

   Congressional negotiators inched toward final
approval of a deficit-reduction plan today as the chairmen of two
tax-writing committees agreed on most elements of a $250 billion
package of tax increases and spending cuts, staff members said.
   The only remaining issue in the plan was how to restrain
spending for Medicaid health services for low-income Americans.
   Spokesmen for Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said details of the final
agreement would be announced later in the morning.
   The plan includes increases in consumer taxes on gasoline,
tobacco, alcoholic beverages and luxuries. It carries a
considerable tax increase on upper-income Americans. Medicare
recipients would foot $10 billion more of their own health costs
under the bill.
   The deficit-reduction package was one of the last major items of
business for a fractious, wearying congressional session that
extended several weeks beyond expectations. ``I think this session
has gone on long enough,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance
Committee arranged meetings later in the day to give their approval
to the package. That would open the way for Congress to get the
bill to President Bush's desk by Sunday.
   Although there was stiff opposition to the bill from many
lawmakers in both parties, House Democratic and Republican leaders
predicted its passage. White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said
Bush considered the plan ``real and credible.''
   ``I haven't been working on this for so long to have something
go down,'' said House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   In other action as Congress pushes toward the end of it its long
election-year session:
   -The House gave voice-vote approval to a $268 billion defense
spending bill, while the Senate planned to vote today on that
measure and the companion military authorization bill. The spending
bill is a cut of $19 billion from Bush's initial proposal in
January. It slashes the president's request for the Strategic
Defense Initiative and barely keeps alive the B-2 stealth bomber
program.
   -The Senate voted 60-36 Thursday to send Bush the 1990 farm
bill, passed by the House two days earlier. The president is
expected to sign the five-year, $40.8 billion measure, which sets
new environmental rules for farmers, sets government nutrition
programs, including food stamps, and aims to reduce subsidized
acreage for farmers by 15 percent.
   -House and Senate sponsors announced agreement on a new $2.5
billion program of child care grants to the states, as the
centerpiece of a long-debated child care bill. Differences remain
over some elements, including an expansion of tax credits for
low-income families.
   -The House approved by voice vote a $57.4 billion housing bill,
including $27.5 billion this fiscal year and $29.9 billion in
fiscal 1992.
   The massive deficit-reduction package - product of half a year
of partisan brawling and interminable negotiations - would affect
almost all Americans.
   It raises the 9-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax by about a
nickel and increases levies on alcohol, tobacco and jewelry as
well.
   It boosts - from 28 percent to 31 percent - the income-tax rate
on the richest Americans, but drops the rate paid by the
upper-middle class from 33 percent to 31 percent. The measure also
reduces the deductions available to people earning more than
$100,000 yearly by 3 percent, and phases out their $2,050 personal
exemptions.
   The details were subject to change in late negotiations.
   Bargainers agreed informally late Thursday to slow the growth of
Medicare benefits by $10 billion through 1995, officials said.
   That figure matched a House proposal that was about $7 billion
lower than the reductions the Senate voted for. Medicare helps pay
medical bills for about 33 million elderly and disabled people.
   An official demanding anonymity said that under the agreement,
the $75 annual deductible paid by beneficiaries would increase to
$100. The monthly premium - $28.60 this year - would grow gradually
to $46.20 by 1995.
   Disagreement remained over the exact size and nature of cuts in
Medicare reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. Those reductions
were expected to total about $33 billion over the next five years.
   The plan cuts student loans, farm aid and other benefit
programs.
   Final agreements were being sought over Medicaid, which helps
the poor pay medical bills. Although the program will be cut,
liberals wanted to provide an additional $2.9 billion for
low-income elderly people. The Bush administration was trying to
reduce that figure.
   Also under negotiation were $2.5 billion worth of tax breaks for
the oil and gas industry, championed by Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas. The Senate also wanted $5.6
billion worth of tax breaks for businesses, including those doing
research, and individuals, for items such as employer-provided
educational benefits.
   With Election Day approaching, members were getting itchy to
halt the budget bickering and return home for campaigning.
   If the leaders were reading their votes correctly, the House and
Senate - where few problems were expected - would dispose of the
bill quickly and let Congress adjourn for the year over the
weekend.
   Michel expected only about 50 of the House's 175 Republicans to
vote for the plan, mainly because of disgruntlement over its
approximately $150 billion in new taxes and spending cuts
considered by some as insufficient. But a GOP pep rally for the
plan on Capitol Hill, attended by Sununu and budget chief Richard
Darman, left supporters encouraged.

<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Larry Pressler is a
self-proclaimed political maverick who often is at odds with GOP
party leaders. But on Election Days past, he has been a consistent
landslide winner.
   Democrat Ted Muenster hopes the disenchantment of GOP leaders is
spreading to voters, but polls indicate he's not having much
success. The Sioux Falls businessman is trying to derail Pressler's
campaign for a third Senate term.
   Muenster casts Pressler as an ineffective, publicity-seeking
professional politician.
   Pressler laughs off such charges. He says he ruffles feathers
because he sometimes votes against the White House and Republican
congressional leaders to do what's best for his home state.
   ``I march to my own drum. I've been criticized for being
independent, but I put South Dakota first,'' the senator says.
   The tactic has worked well in past elections, particularly when
he won re-election in 1984 with the most votes ever cast for a
South Dakota candidate.
   Earlier this year, Muenster was touted as one of the Democratic
party's best hopes for defeating a Republican senator.
   But an independent poll taken early this month showed Pressler
leading by a wide margin. Pressler was supported by 60 percent of
those surveyed and Muenster by 26 percent in a poll with a 4.5
percentage point margin of error.
   Muenster says his own polls show a much closer race. He says
he's winning the undecided voters, many of them swayed by ads done
for him by Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle, probably South Dakota's
most popular elected official.
   Pressler says most of his GOP critics are people who want his
job.
   ``The real test of all this is not what people say, but what the
voting results are,'' he says.
   Muenster acknowledges Pressler has been immensely popular but he
maintains that voters are coming to believe the GOP senator is
ineffective and gets no respect from other members of Congress.
   ``He portrays that as independence, but he is not independent,''
Muenster said. ``In fact, he's out of it in terms of being a factor
in Congress.''
   Most GOP grumbling comes in private conversations.
   But when former GOP Gov. Bill Janklow was asked last year to
list Pressler's significant achievements, he said: ``I honestly
can't think of anything.''
   Sioux Falls businessman David Billion briefly considered
challenging Pressler in a GOP primary, saying Pressler hadn't
accomplished much for South Dakota.
   On Thursday, Pressler came under Democratic fire on the floor of
the Senate after he complained about lax limits on the use of
congressional mailings by members of the House.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., rose to question Pressler about his
own mass mailings. ``I believe ... that he was the newsletter king
last year,'' Ford said.
   Pressler responded that he had mailed just one congressional
newsletter this year. Senate records show that last year, he sent
out 10 mass mailings for every household in his state, more than
any other senator.
   Last month, Ford made a campaign appearance for Muenster in
which he said Pressler ``doesn't mingle'' and ``doesn't prepare for
anything.''
   Muenster says Congress isn't dealing with the nation's problems,
particularly the need to balance the budget, and that Pressler is
an example of what's wrong.
   ``I'm not a professional politician,'' he said. ``We need more
citizen members of Congress and fewer professional politicians.''
   Pressler responds by citing a long list of accomplishments for
South Dakota. He says he's helped save a rail line, protected
federal highway funding and air service, fought for senior citizens
and small businesses and for open international markets for U.S.
farm products.
   ``The point is, I put South Dakota first,'' he says.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of high school students staged
protests today across France, intensifying pressure on education
authorities to improve safety at crumbling, crime-ridden public
schools.
   The demonstrations were the latest in a two-week series of
strikes by students fed up with campus violence, overcrowded
classrooms, and what they see as government indifference to the
poor condition of their schools.
   On Wednesday, Education Minister Lionel Jospin promised that 100
security guards would be added to schools most troubled by the
surging wave of campus violence that led to the original strikes.
   But student leaders in Paris derided the measure as
insufficient.
   Police reported about 7,000 students marched today in the
streets of Toulouse, 5,000 in Valenciennes, 4,000 in Amiens, 4,000
in Saint Etienne and 18,000 in seven other provincial cities.
   Regional authorities near Montpellier, in southern France,
reported that four student demonstrators fell off a staircase and
were injured. Two were hospitalized.
   The marches began a week ago in the tough northern suburbs of
Paris with a few hundred students but have since swelled as a
prelude to the one-week All Saints Day vacation period.
   The recent surge of crime at high schools has included the rape
of a girl in a school lavatory, assaults on several teachers, and
cases of extortion.
   Thousands of teachers held a protest last weekend in sympathy
with the students and to demand higher pay.
   But Jospin warned teachers on Wednesday that salary increases of
$1,192 promised this year would have to be cut to $384 due to
budget constraints.
   The move seemed certain to escalate tensions between the
government and teachers unions.
   The most violent schools are those built in the 1960s near
hastily erected high-rise projects built to house immigrant workers
and poor French families.
   French media reported this week on schools with crumbling
concrete, holes in the ceilings, graffiti-scarred hallways, and
classrooms with no desks or chairs.

   A 3-year-old girl was reunited with her
mother today after she was abducted from the family car and held
for a ransom of cocaine and cash, authorities said.
   Three armed men took Porshea Hamilton from her mother's car in
the driveway of their west Los Angeles home at 9:30 a.m. Thursday,
said Officer Jim Farris.
   The child was released about midnight on a street in
south-central Los Angeles. She knocked on the door of a nearby home
for help, Ferris said.
   ``The child is safe. The child is in good condition. She was not
harmed,'' said Cmdr. William Booth. Officers gave her an apple and
milk to drink at the police station.
   Harold Bridges, 27, Tonia Hilt, 21, Donzie Hill, 20, Baron
Williams, 20, and a 16-year-old boy were taken into custody, police
said. The youth's identity was not released because of his age.
   Bridges and Hilt were booked for investigation of kidnapping and
held on $100,000 bail, police said. Bail had not been set for the
others early today.
   Police said Porshea was abducted as her mother, Gina Hamilton,
backed the car out of their driveway. Later, Ms. Hamilton received
telephone calls demanding a ransom of cocaine and cash, Booth said.
   Undercover officers negotiated with the callers and set up a
ransom payment at a parking lot, which they staked out to make the
arrests, Booth said.

<HEAD>Three Charged In Sheriff's Campaign Worker Shooting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men have been charged in what police called
the politically motivated shooting of a campaign worker in the
bitter election fight for sheriff.
   Authorities charged the three men on Thursday as the campaign
between Cook County sheriff candidates Michael Sheahan and James
O'Grady continued.
   Doctors at Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn upgraded Cook County Jail
guard Irving Bell from critical to serious condition Thursday, said
nursing supervisor Therese Murray.
   Bell, a Sheahan supporter, was shot three times outside a South
Side tavern, the Surf Lounge, early Tuesday in a dispute over
campaign signs. Bell's companions ran over him with a van as they
fled, police said.
   Bell and other Sheahan supporters were hanging signs outside the
when the shooting began, said Sheahan, the Democratic candidate
trying to oust incumbent Republican O'Grady.
   But O'Grady accused Bell of trying to tear down his campaign
signs and said Sheahan's campaign of intimidation and vandalism
sparked the incident.
   The candidates have accused each other's campaign workers of
vandalizing signs and offices.
   Tyler Sanders, 23, of Chicago was charged with one count each of
attempted murder and mob action in the attack, said Chicago Police
Detective John Boyle. Cook County correctional officer John Magett,
47, and Brian Frazier, 25, who worked as a disc jockey at the Surf
Lounge, were each charged with one count of mob action, Boyle said.
   The trio, arrested shortly after Tuesday's shooting, remained in
police lockups Thursday night awaiting bond hearings, Boyle said.
   Meanwhile, a third-party candidate for sheriff, placed back on
the November ballot by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Thursday,
said the incident proved that neither Sheahan nor O'Grady deserved
to hold the office.
   ``Look at the way they've campaigned,'' said Harold Washington
Party candidate Thomas Brewer. ``They have created this kind of
environment that then filters down to their employees.''

<TEXT>
   An anti-government strike ended
today, and a shootout aboard a bus killed a policeman and two
Communist rebels and left seven people wounded.
   The three-day nationwide strike, called by leftist unions, had
been marked by attacks on public transportation.
   The strikers warned they would return to the streets if the
government would not agree to their wage demands.
   However, they backed off somewhat on those demands and were
awaiting a reply from the government on their latest call.
   The early morning gunfight in Laguna province south of Manila
came after police questioned suspected New People's Army guerrillas
when the bus stopped at a checkpoint in Pila town.
   Police Capt. Gilbert Sauro said the suspects opened fire,
killing the policeman. Police returned the fire, killing two
rebels. Sauro said the guerrillas were apparently planning to set
the bus on fire.
   About 5,000 militant workers and students marched to the
presidential palace for a rally today, where they announced the end
of the strike. The demonstration ended peacefully.
   President Corazon Aquino ordered the Justice Department to study
possible charges against strike leaders. She also ordered
government employees who joined the strike to explain their action
or face discipline.

<TEXT>
   Temple University and the union representing
professors reached a tentative agreement on a new contract,
resolving disputes that led to a 29-day strike.
   But bitterness remained as the Temple faculty senate voted 116-1
on Thursday to have the entire faculty vote on a demand that
university President Peter J. Liacouras resign. Liacouras'
opponents said he was not giving the faculty enough voice in
decision-making.
   Neither side would release details of the contract agreement
reached late Thursday.
   ``I will talk to the members first,'' said Arthur Hochner,
president of the Temple Association of University Professionals.
The association represents 1,100 faculty members and other academic
employees.
   The union rejected the university's offer of 5 percent annual
pay increases and struck Sept. 4. The walkout ended Oct. 3 after a
judge ordered professors to return to their classrooms. The
university then revised the calendar, extending fall semester
classes through Jan. 15.
   Union members will vote next week on ratification of the
agreement, Hochner said.
   Temple spokesman George Ingram said the agreement grew out of 60
to 70 hours of negotiations over the past week.
   Negotiators resolved the issue of pay for teachers who have been
asked to work an extended schedule to make up classes missed during
the strike, he said.
   Liacouras released a statement saying the administration was
pleased about the tentative settlement.
   ``We are especially pleased that the length of this contract
will provide for long-range stability,'' he said. But he wouldn't
say how long the contract was.
   Liacouras, a former dean of the Temple law school, has been
university president since 1982.

<TEXT>
   Seven candidates, including rivals Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, say
they have entered the race for the country's first popularly
elected president.
   The seven said they had submitted the required number of
signatures to enter the race, and the National Election Commission
was checking the documents today.
   The deadline for registering as a candidate for the Nov. 25
election was midnight Thursday. Fifteen men had announced their
candidacy, but only seven claimed to have met the registration
requirements.
   Among the candidates are Mazowiecki, representing the Citizens'
Movement for Democratic Action, and Walesa, running on the Center
Alliance ticket.
   Both parties have their roots in Solidarity. The trade union
divided into the two groups in June.
   Mazowiecki draws his support largely from intellectuals in
Warsaw and Krakow, while Walesa is backed by workers and farmers.
   A nationwide poll this week by the government polling agency
CBOS suggested Mazowiecki was the front-runner.
   According to the survey of 791 people who have decided on a
candidate, 49 percent favored Mazowiecki, 34 percent support
Walesa, and 17 percent backed other candidates.
   Walesas supporters dismissed the poll results as unreliable.
   If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote on Nov.
25, a run-off election between the two leading candidates will be
held Dec. 9.
   The other candidates and their affiliations are:
   -former Communist Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Social Democracy.
   -Roman Bartoszcze, Polish Peasant's Party.
   -Stan Tyminski, a Polish-born Canadian, an independent.
   -Leszek Moczulski, the KPN, a small right-wing party.
   -and Kornel Morawiecki, the Fighting Solidarity organization.
   Campaign broadcasting on the country's two state-run TV stations
and four radio stations was scheduled to begin today and will last
until Nov. 23.

<TEXT>
   Resentment is bubbling over congresional
approval of $500,000 to restore the birthplace of Lawrence Welk,
the king of champagne music.
   The project's leader defended the plan to renovate the sod
farmhouse where Welk was born and develop a German-Russian history
museum and other tourist attractions.
   ``People are saying we're taking money away from farmers. It's
not so,'' Rosemary Schaefbauer, president of Welk Heritage Inc.,
said Thursday. ``This money was allocated for rural development.
North Dakota is going to benefit a whole lot from it.''
   The grant is included in a $52.2 billion agricultural
appropriations bill that the House passed Monday and sent to
President Bush.
   It piqued the interest of radio talk-show hosts across the
country, who have been calling Schaefbauer. It also raised the ire
of Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., who said it's an example of the kind
of projects the country cannot afford during a budget crunch.
   ``What will they do for an encore? Earmark funds to renovate Guy
Lombardo's speedboat? Or restore Artie Shaw's wedding tuxedo?''
Conte asked.
   Welk, 87, does not grant interviews, but one of his daughters,
Shirley Fredricks, said by telephone from Los Angeles that the
grant caught the family by surprise.
   ``We were astonished and I must say embarrassed,'' she said.
``We actually didn't know until last week that the funding had even
been asked for.''
   She said the family would have preferred the money come from
private sources, but Sen. Quentin Burdick, D-N.D., thought federal
money could help.
   ``As the senator said, it's for the town, it's not for Lawrence
Welk,'' press secretary Jean Broadshaug said today. The money will
help with the town's plans to build a small hotel, community center
and restaurants.
   ``Everyone does what they can for their own constituents,'' she
said, replying to Conte's remarks. ``And I think in this case
anyone who has ever been to Strasburg can recognize it needs some
help.''
   Welk Heritage Inc. applied for a federal grant three months ago,
after a board member saw an application in a Farmers Home
Administration office.
   Many in Strasburg, a town of 600 in south-central North Dakota,
say the money could have been put to better use, but that the town
may as well take it. ``If there's money to throw away, we might as
well have it,'' said Fred Martin, a resident of the Strasburg
nursing home. ``Farmers will get their share.''
   ``If you want to do something with the money, why don't they do
something to help the roads and bridges?,'' said resident Neis
Norman. ``We're a farming community and if farmers don't have
anything, the town doesn't either,'' he said.
   Welk lived on the farm near Strasburg until he was 21. Then,
with a new accordion, he formed a band in Yankton, S.D., and began
his career as one of the country's most successful bandleaders.
   The total cost of the restoration project is estimated at
$750,000, including $500,000 for a trust to maintain the museum
after it opens. Work began this summer in anticipation of a June 2
grand opening.
   ``I can well understand that citizens are very concerned that
tax dollars are going into this project,'' Schaefbauer said. ``But
it's very common for museums and so forth to get federal grants
from time to time.''
   ``It's more than just the birthplace of Lawrence Welk,'' she
said. ``It's a perfect example of how their homes were built in
that time frame.''
   ``I think the payoff will probably come down the line in another
generation, when our children will be able to go there and see how
the pioneers lived.''

defendant must now become an example of another kind,'' Jackson
said.
   In issuing the sentence, Jackson forged a middle ground between
the recommendations of prosecutors who urged that Barry be given
the maximum one-year sentence and the defense, which argued for
parole or community service.
   For the first time in his 10-month legal drama, Barry himself
spoke in court and asked for leniency from the judge.
   ``I stand here truly remorseful and ask this court to impose
community service as a sentence,'' Barry said.
   In court papers submitted late Thursday, Barry for the first
time admitted he was a drug addict.

<HEAD>Woman Gets 10 Years for Killing That Touched Off Riots</HEAD>

   A judge ordered a 10-year sentence for a
19-year-old woman accused of igniting two nights of rioting when
she killed a bystander while shooting into a crowd during a drug
deal.
   Tamala Vergo was sentenced Thursday by state District Judge
Eugene Bryson.
   ``This court has before it a 19-year-old woman who was at the
wrong place - a drug area; with the wrong people - drug dealers;
doing the wrong thing - trying to purchase drugs,'' Bryson said.
   In June, Vergo was convicted of manslaughter in the Sept. 20,
1988, death of David McKinney, a bystander in a parking lot where
Vergo and a friend had gone to buy crack cocaine.
   The pair's car stalled when they tried to leave after an
argument with the drug dealers. Vergo fired at the dealers, killing
McKinney.
   She was acquitted of the more serious charge of second-degree
murder, which carries an automatic sentence of life in prison. The
friend, Cynthia Johnson, 27, was acquitted of charges of being a
principal to McKinney's murder.
   A large crowd that gathered after the shooting pelted Shreveport
police with rocks and bottles. The crowd also looted and burned
four businesses.
   At her sentencing, Vergo maintained that she fired the gun in
self-defense.
   ``I feel like the conviction was all wrong,'' she said
tearfully. ``I was scared for my life.''
   A wrongful death suit filed by McKinney's family against Vergo's
parents was settled for $100,000, court documents show.
   Jack Bailey, an attorney representing McKinney's family,
criticized the sentence.
   ``It wasn't very much recovery for the death of a son,'' Bailey
said. ``I think a 10-year sentence for that crime is awfully
lenient.''
   Defense attorney Maurice Loridans said he will appeal Vergo's
conviction. He would not comment on the sentence. She could have
received up to 21 years.
   The judge denied prosecutor Howard Fish's request that Vergo be
required to serve at least five years before becoming eligible for
parole. She will be eligible for parole in three years.

   Chinese Vice President Wang Zhen has been
hospitalized, an official report said today.
   The Guangming Daily said in a two-paragraph report that Wang
received a delegation from the Japanese Friendship Association in
his hospital room Thursday. He is onorary chairman of the
Sino-Japanese Friendship Association.
   The report gave no details about Wang's condition, and the
Japanese delegation could not be immediately reached for comment.
   Wang, 82, has been rarely seen in public in recent months. He
was conspicuously missing on Sept. 30 from a National Day
reception, which was attended by all other state and Communist
Party leaders.
   Wang is not known to have any serious health problems although
he walks with the aid of a cane.
   A former political commissar, Wang is a hard-line ideologue who
rose through the military ranks.
   Although the vice presidency is a largely ceremonial post,
Wang's influence is believed to have grown since the retirement of
senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Wang was one of the old revolutionaries who took part in the
Communists' guerrilla struggle against the Nationalists and the
Japanese. He is believed to be close to Deng and have a high
standing among the military.

<HEAD>Probe into Garcia's Role in 1986 Prison Massacre Approved</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EMERY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional committee has approved an
investigation into the role of former President Alan Garcia in the
1986 massacre of 250 prisoners.
   The committee, which is headed by leftist legislator Julio
Castro Gomez, approved the measure unanimously on Thursday. ``There
is sufficient proof for the investigation to proceed,'' Castro
said.
   Garcia, who served as president from 1985 until July 28, has
already renounced his congressional immunity, and could be jailed
if found guilty of ordering the massacres.
   As a former president, Garcia was named senator for life when he
handed over power to President Alberto Fujimori.
   Opposition congressmen say Garcia should share the
responsibility for the June 1986 massacre, which occurred when the
armed forces put down riots in three Lima prisons. Most of the dead
were members of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla movement.
   A 1987 Senate investigation produced a report blaming Garcia and
his Cabinet for the killings. It said Garcia's decision to place
control of the situation in the hands of the military led directly
to the massacre.
   Garcia has maintained he and military leaders at the time were
innocent. He accused lower-ranking military officials of carrying
out summary executions of prisoners after they surrendered.
   In December, a military court found a police colonel and
lieutenant guilty of killing 60 to 70 rebels in the Lima prison of
Lurigancho. The court absolved another 76 army officers and
policemen.
   Garcia, who at age 36 became the youngest president to be
elected in Peru's history, brought on an unprecedented economic
crisis.
   His free-spending, center-left administration left the country
with 3,000 percent annual inflation and a $20 billion foreign debt
on which no payments have been made since 1987.
   During Garcia's tenure, the rural insurgency and poverty
increased amid charges of widespread government corruption.

<HEAD>Feds Suspend Northwest Pilot's License After Small-Plane Incidents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FARIBAULT, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines captain had his
pilot's license suspended after authorities said he buzzed a
snowmobile race in one small plane and crash-landed another because
of a fuel problem.
   Martin ``Roy'' Redman of rural Faribault and members of his
family escaped injury when a twin-engine Beechcraft plane he was
piloting crash-landed at Faribault airport in August.
   Chris Zurales, a Federal Aviation Administration attorney, said
Tuesday that the National Transportation Safety Board already was
investigating Redman for allegedly buzzing the race on Cannon Lake
last winter. The board issued an emergency revocation of Redman's
license Sept. 11 in response to the August crash, Zurales said.
   Redman appealed the revocation at an Oct. 9-10 hearing before an
NTSB administrative law judge, who ordered a nine-month suspension
of Redman's license.
   Bob Gibbons, spokesman for the Minnesota-based Northwest, said
today that after a suspension, a pilot must requalify to fly for
the airline.
   ``He'll have to go through ground training and simulator flight
training and be evaluated by the Northwest training department and
the FAA,'' Gibbons said.
   Rick Rabeneck, a sheriff's deputy who was at the snowmobile
race, said Redman caused a panic when his 1948 Monocoupe plane
dived toward the crowd, passing over it at 25 or 30 feet.
   Redman says he saw what looked like a runway and made a slow
descent to get a better look. He then flew the plane over the race
course.
   ``It was not a dive,'' he said.
   Redman admits he broke FAA regulations by flying lower than
1,000 feet above a crowd, but calls Rabeneck's allegations
``exaggeration.''
   In the second incident, an FAA official said an engine quit
because of fuel starvation. The FAA found that Redman had placed a
fuel selector in an incorrect position, but the pilot insists a
mechanical failure in the fuel system was the likely cause.

<HEAD>Albania Condemns Writer's Defection as ``Ugly Act''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania today condemned as ``an ugly
act'' the defection of the country's leading writer, which
embarrassed Communist leaders hosting their first high-level
international conference in decades.
   Ismail Kadare, probably Albania's best-known public figure after
President Ramiz Alia, requested political asylum Thursday during a
visit to France with his wife and two daughters. France granted his
request hours later.
   The announcement came as Albania, seeking to emerge from decades
of self-imposed isolation, hosted foreign ministers from the other
five Balkan nations - Bulgaria, Turkey, Greece, Romania and
Yugoslavia.
   Albania is seeking to join the 34-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe. It was the only country in Europe which
refused to sign the 1975 Helsinki Final Act which spawned the
conference.
   Officials said Thursday the timing of Kadare's defection did not
appear coincidental. ``He picked his moment,'' an official from the
Albanian Journalists' Union said on condition of anonymity.
   Official Albanian media only reported the defection Friday. The
official ATA news agency cited foreign media as the source of the
news.
   ``The foreign press reports say that the writer Ismail Kadare
... requested political refuge'' in France Thursday, ATA said.
   ``Through this ugly act, which is a grave offence for the
patriotic and civic conscience of our people, he abandoned the
people and homeland and placed himself in service of the enemies of
Albania and the Albanian people.''
   The statement smacked of the Stalinist terminology often used by
Eastern Europe's hard-line Communist leaders before the Soviet bloc
was swept by democratic revolutions late last year.
   The defection dealt a blow to the Communist leadership just as
it is introducing cautious reforms in the hope it can avoid the
fate of Eastern Europe's fallen Stalinists.
   In a country where writers and intellectuals traditionally play
a part in political movements, Kadare was seen as a spiritual
leader for reform, as well as the nation's greatest author.
   Last year he was made deputy chairman of the Democratic Front, a
leading Communist group, and had begun speaking out for human
rights in Albania. He had strongly criticized the country's secret
police.
   Some officials did not believe the news of Kadare's defection.
Foreign Minister Reis Malile suggested Thursday it was a
``set-up,'' though he did not say by whom. ``Kadare is dead.
Democratization is not dead,'' Malile said, suggesting that gradual
reforms would continue.
   Kadare was respected, especially among the young, because of his
international standing. His books are relatively well-known in
France; a few have been published in the United States.
   He has never been a dissident in his own country. Even under
Enver Hoxha, the country's post-World War II founder and dictator
until his death in 1985, he was revered as a writer.
   Kadare's elevation by authorities to a leadership role in the
ruling paty indicated he was supposed to help the process of
gradual reform. But in his statement from Paris Kadare said reforms
weren't coming fast enough.
   ``The promises made were not kept, and my disillusion, like that
of the immense majority of Albanians, was all the more bitter,'' he
said.
   In May, Albania loosened emigration controls, and about 5,000 of
the country's 3 million citizens fled abroad.
   A draft election law published this week provides for more than
one candidate to contest each parliamentary seat and for secret
ballots. But it does not foresee a multiparty system.

   The battleship USS Iowa, which survived two
wars and a catastrophic explosion and fire that killed 47 crewmen,
was decommissioned today for a third time.
   The World War II and Korean War veteran, with 16-inch guns that
sent their 2,000-pound projectiles at targets as far away as 20
miles, was taken out of service 47 years after it first joined the
Navy.
   Strong wind and rain forced the ceremony to be moved from a pier
at the Norfolk Naval Base to the bridge of the ship. Several
hundred former Iowa crewmen and their families gathered in the
ship's mess hall, where they chatted but could not hear the
ceremony.
   Also aboard were some relatives of crewmen who were killed in
the explosion and fire on the ship on April 19, 1989.
   ``He would want us to be here,'' said Paula Schwarz of
Levittown, N.Y., whose brother, Peter Bopp, died in the blast.
   In the ceremony, the Iowa's chaplain said the ship's crewmen,
living and dead, should be remembered for their role in preserving
democracy.
   ``Although we bid farewell to the teak decks and steel plates,
we do not say goodbye to Iowa, for Iowa is us,'' said the chaplain,
Cmdr. Joseph C. Cappar.
   During World War II, the ship carried President Roosevelt to a
war conference. The ship was fitted with a bathtub for Roosevelt,
who had trouble standing because of polio. To this day, the Iowa
remains the only ship in the Navy with a bathtub.
   After serving in the Pacific providing protection for aircraft
carriers, the Iowa was decommissioned in 1949.
   The battleship stayed in mothballs for little more than two
years before it was brought back to service in August 1951. Its
guns fired more than 4,000 rounds during the Korean War.
   The ship was put in storage from 1958 until 1984, when it was
recommissioned as part of the Navy buildup to a 600-ship fleet. At
a cost of $435 million, the ship was modernized into a platform for
cruise missiles. The big guns were considered a bonus.
   Perhaps the most shattering incident in the ship's history was
the explosion and fireball that raced through the No. 2 turret
during an open seas gunnery exercise last year. The crew fought the
fire and saved their ship.
   In less than 60 days, the ship was able to make a scheduled
Mediterranean deployment, with its No. 2 turret sealed. But because
of federal budget deficits, officials decided not to spend the
estimated $13 million it would cost to repair the ship.
   A Navy investigation into the explosion laid the blame on a
disgruntled gunner's mate who died in the blast. Navy officials
said the gunner's mate deliberately sabotaged the guns.
   That report has been challenged by some of the families of the
47 sailors and some members of Congress. Earlier this year, the
Navy reopened a portion of the investigation.

   Officials aren't legally responsible for
the murder of a former district attorney by a man he once
prosecuted, even though they didn't warn him that the released
convict was in trouble with the law again, a court ruled.
   The state appeals court ruled Thursday in a suit filed by the
family of William Weissich against authorities for allegedly
breaking a promise to warn Weissich about the convict, who had
threatened his life.
   The suit said officials of Sonoma and Marin counties and the
state knew that Malcolm Schlette was convicted of possessing guns
in 1983, eight years after his release from prison, but failed to
tell Weissich.
   Weissich, Marin County district attorney from 1953 to 1960, was
shot to death in his San Rafael law office in November 1986 by
Schlette, who then killed himself.
   In upholding a judge's dismissal of the suit, the 1st District
Court of Appeal said law enforcement officers may have made a
binding promise in 1975 to warn Weissich about any menacing actions
by Schlette.
   But any legal duty to warn the former prosecutor had expired by
1983, when Schlette was arrested again for the guns possession, the
court said.
   ``The duty of a good Samaritan is of limited duration,'' said
the 3-0 ruling, written by Justice Gary Strankman. ``A person who
has performed a voluntary duty is not required to render aid
indefinitely.''
   Marin County Counsel Douglas Maloney said the court ``had to
draw the line somewhere.''
   ``There's a limit to how much protection you can give anyone,''
he said. He said the murder was ``a terrible tragedy, but the law
can't solve all these things.''
   Alvin Goldstein, a lawyer for Weissich's widow, Rosemary, and
her family, said the ruling would be appealed.
   Schlette was convicted of arson and sentenced to 20 years in
prison in 1955, and threatened the lives of Weissich and others in
the case. He was paroled in 1966 and was promptly arrested again,
carrying a list of names of people involved in the prosecution. He
finished his sentence in 1975.
   The suit said county and state officials then promised to tell
Weissich of any threatening behavior by Schlette. But they failed
to tell him in 1983 when Schlette was arrested by federal agents,
pleaded guilty to illegal gun possession and was placed on
probation, the suit said.
   It also said Sonoma County learned in May 1986 that Schlette
again had guns, but failed to detain him or warn Weissich.
   Weissich, who installed a bulletproof door and took other
security measures after Schlette's earlier threats, moved to a new
office and relaxed his guard after authorities promised to warn
him, his family's suit said.
   A similar suit is pending in federal court accusing the federal
government of improperly releasing Schlette on probation after his
1983 arrest.

   Central Iowa hospitals are bracing for a
late fall baby boom believed linked to a March ice storm that left
many homes without heat or electricity for days.
   Des Moines hospitals that offer childbirth classes report sharp
increases of enrollment among families expecting babies in late
November or early December.
   Health professionals speculate most of those babies were
conceived in early March after a storm that toppled power lines and
left many homes without electricity for as long as three days.
   ``It's just our general idea that's what happened,'' said Pam
Stephens, the receptionist at Gynecology and Obstetrics M.D.s in
Des Moines. She said the three doctors on staff expect to deliver
45 babies in December, compared with about 35 in an average month.
   Judy Schlife, childbirth education coordinator at Mercy Hospital
Medical Center in Des Moines, said enrollment in Lamaze classes
rose by 25 couples from October to November.
   At Iowa Lutheran Hospital, 24 couples have signed up for
Wednesday and Thursday childbirth classes, double the number
usually enrolled for the midweek program. The Des Moines Birthplace
reports a 50 percent increase in class size.

   A group of cabdrivers' wives, fed up with their

arrested on gambling charges.
   One wife didn't stop with calling police, said Officer Roger
O'Brien. She also wrote letters to the district commander
complaining about her husband's gambling losses.
   In addition, the commander received complaints from North Side
residents because many cabs frequently were parked near the M &amp; M
Restaurant.
   ``In excess of 50 cabs were parked in the immediate area - in
front of the restaurant and in a parking lot,'' O'Brien said
Thursday. ``It was unbelievable.''
   Several wives called police, some anonymously, to complain that
money needed to pay family bills was being lost by their spouses at
the restaurant, O'Brien said.
   O'Brien and two other officers raided the restaurant Wednesday
night after observing gambling through a window during a weeklong
investigation.
   Much of the action, O'Brien said, involved side bets on two pool
games; other cabdrivers gambled on electronic games.
   The restaurant owner was charged with operating a gambling
house.

   Guinea's ambassador to the United States
faces sex charges in connection with an alleged assault of a maid
at a downtown hotel.
   Ambassador Moussa Sangare faces up to 18 months in jail and a
$3,000 fine if convicted on one count each of misdemeanor sexual
battery and false imprisonment, said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the
City Attorney's Office.
   ``The State Department advised us to prosecute this case like we
would any other and take it from there,'' Qualls said Thursday.
   Authorities said the maid at the Biltmore Hotel told them she
knocked on the door of the ambassador's room Sept. 4 to ask if he
wanted his bed turned down, a routine service. Sangare is accused
of grabbing her and fondling her as she turned the bedsheets down.
   A telephone message seeking comment, left with the Embassy of
Guinea in Washington, was not immediately returned.
   As an official representative of another country, the ambassador
can claim diplomatic immunity. If he does, the case would be
forwarded to the State Department, Qualls said.
   Arraignment in Municipal Court was scheduled for Jan. 3.
   The City Attorney's Office sent a letter to Sangare's
Washington, D.C., residence on Thursday, notifying the ambassador
that charges had been filed.
   The ambassador checked into the Biltmore on Sept. 3 with a group
of other West African ambassadors. He left on Sept. 9, returning to
Guinea.

   The artists take center stage, pouring
their hearts into soulful renditions of Chopin's ``Waltz in C Sharp
Minor,'' upbeat versions of ``You Are My Sunshine'' and jazzy
interpretations of ``New York, New York.''
   But these musicians aren't pounding pianos or plucking guitars.
Their instrument is the accordion.
   ``The accordion is a personal instrument,'' said Lindy Kao,
president of the Chicago Accordion Club. ``When you strap that
accordion on your chest, it's a part of you. You really feel the
music.''
   The Chicago Accordion Club has 184 dues-paying members who meet
on the fourth Monday of each month to play and listen to accordion
music.
   ``A lot of people love accordion music, but they're sort of
closeted,'' said Jimmy Dee, the club's 64-year-old treasurer. ``The
club gives them the opportunity to come out.''
   Dee said he hopes the accordion's popularity is on the upswing
with the younger generation, but about two-thirds of club's members
are over 40.
   ``When we're gone, we don't want to leave the instrument out in
the cold,'' Dee said of the instrument he has played for 53 years.
``We've been just waiting for a revival.''
   Club members say they're encouraged to see pop musicians like
John Cougar Mellencamp and Billy Joel using accordions in their
music.
   ``I made my living with the accordion, supported my family, sent
my kids to school,'' said Manny Quartucci, 69, the club's vice
president. ``When all the electronic instruments came along ... it
hurt the accordion.''
   But the accordion also is squeezing its way into the electronic
world.
   Joe Petosa, 30, of Seattle, manufactures accordions, including
the electric MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) accordion,
which can function similar to synthesizers widely used in pop
bands.
   ``I think the instrument's on its way back,'' Petosa said.

   A gale blew a dredge into the only bridge
to Hatteras Island today, severing the span and stranding thousands
of people without power.
   The island's estimated 5,000 residents and an unknown number of
tourists had no way off the island. Ferry connections to via
neighboring Ocracoke Island couldn't be used because winds were
gusting to 60 mph, creating waves of 5 to 7 feet in Pamlico Sound.
   No injuries were reported in the crash, which collapsed a
250-foot section of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, severed utility
lines that run along it, and grounded the dredge Northerly Island.
Another 50-foot section of the bridge was in danger of falling,
police said.
   The 2{-mile-long bridge connects Hatteras Island with Bodie
Island to the north along North Carolina's Outer Banks.
   ``There is no way to get across that bridge. It's gone,
collapsed,'' said Gwen White, Dare County public information
officer.
   The accident knocked out electrical and telephone service to
Hatteras Island and to most of Ocracoke Island, located to the
south and accessable only by ferry.
   Renee Hoffman of the state Emergency Management Division said
authorities were trying to figure out how to get temporary
electrical service set up. It is hoped that ferry service can be
re-established witin 24 hours, she said this morning. Repairing
the bridge could take months.
   Dare County Commissioner Gaskill Austin, who lives on Hatteras
Island, said residents were ``literally in the dark out here'' but
were used to minor power outages because of the frequent storms.
   ``As the word spreads, I'm sure my phone's going to be jammed,''
he said in an interview conducted by ham radio.
   ``A big need will be generators ... and to save as much
foodstuffs as we have here in the stores. That and the water is my
primary concern at this point.''
   County emergency officials believe nobody was on the bridge when
the 200-foot-long dredge struck it at about 1:30 a.m. They had
gotten word a half hour earlier that the dredge had broken free of
its anchor, and they closed the bridge.
   Highway Patrol Trooper A.C. Joyner was on the bridge when the
dredge hit about 300 yards south of him.
   ``The bridge started bowing out in a westerly direction, and it
bowed out from one to two to three feet as the ship was pressing
against it,'' Joyner said. The bridge collapsed about an hour
later, he said.
   ``There was an electrical explosion and all the power lines and
telephone lines were destroyed.'' He said the dredge was stuck in
the bridge, but later authorities said it appeared to be grounded,
possibly on pieces of the collapsed bridge.
   Four of the 10 people on the dredge got off safely by climbing
to the top of the dredge and onto the bridge. The six others were
expected to remain on the dredge until the waves subsided, said
Mikey Daniels, chairman of the Dare County Board of Commissioners.
They were not in danger, authorities said.
   Daniels estimated the island's permanent population at 5,000.
About 500 to 600 people live at Ocracoke. The Outer Banks are a
popular destination for tourists, and while the peak summer tourist
season has passed, it's still a prime season for fishermen.
   Repairing the bridge could take six months, Daniels said. Ms.
White said state officials said the repair job was so big that a
private contractor would have to be hired.
   The bridge was the only route to the island from the north.
Residents would have to drive to a ferry taking them to Ocracoke
Island, then to one of two ferries to the mainland. The detour for
someone trying to reach Nags Head, about 10 miles north of the
severed bridge, would involve more than 125 miles of driving and
the two ferry rides, one about 25 miles long.

<TEXT>
   Kidnapped American journalist Terry
Anderson, the longest-held among 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon,
turns 43 on Saturday, his sixth birthday in captivity.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped at gunpoint in Moslem west Beirut on March 16,
1985. There has been no indication that his pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem captors plan to free him.
   Former hostage Brian Keenan of Northern Ireland, who was
released on Aug. 24, said he spent part of his more than four years
in captivity with Anderson.
   He said Anderson, whom he last saw ``some time ago,'' suffered
from a digestive ailment and was frequently in pain.
   But Keenan noted that Anderson bore his pain stoically because
``in truth, all pain and illness was generally dismissed by our
keepers, although they would eventually supply us with some form of
antibiotics.''
   He said Anderson, who with other hostages was kept in chains and
blindfolded much of the time, suffered ``periods of despair and
would seek solace in his family.''
   But he noted that Anderson has been allowed to receive letters
from his family and has a photograph of his youngest daughter,
Sulome, 5, who was born three months after he was kidnapped.
   ``Terry and myself would sit through those long nights and speak
with great pain and remorse and longing for his daughter,'' Keenan
said.
   On Saturday, Lebanese newspapers plan to publish letters to
Anderson from Sulome, her Lebanese mother, Madeleine, and Peggy
Say, his sister.
   The Arabic-language papers said they will also publish the
original English texts of the letters in the hope that Anderson
will be allowed to read them. Anderson did not know Arabic when he
was kidnapped.
   During his captivity, he has lost his father, Glenn R. Anderson,
and elder brother, Glenn Richard Jr. Both died of cancer. As far as
is known, Anderson is unaware of those deaths.
   Anderson's father died 11 months after the kidnapping and his
46-year-old brother died June 7, 1986, four days after making a
videotape from his hospital bed pleading with Anderson's kidnappers
to release him.
   Apart from Anderson, the missing Westerners include five other
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans and an Italian.
   Altogether, 89 foreigners have been kidnapped or disappeared in
Lebanon since January 1984. Sixty-seven have been freed or said
they escaped and nine have been killed.
   Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the U.S. military
deployment in the Persian Gulf have complicated efforts to free
Anderson and the other Americans, with pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
leaders close to the kidnappers denouncing both developments.
   Hussein Musawi, reputed mentor of some of the hostage-holders,
has repeatedly emphasized that an early release of the American
captives was unlikely.
   ``We denounce Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and we also
denounce the American military deployment in Moslem lands,'' he
said.
   A fundamentalist Shiite faction called Islamic Jihad, or Islamic
Holy War, claims to hold Anderson and another American, 58-year-old
educator Thomas Sutherland, who was kidnapped on June 9, 1985.
   The last statement from Islamic Jihad that referred to Anderson
and Sutherland was issued on Oct. 24, 1989. It renewed the group's
demand that 15 convicted terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait be freed.
   But the terrorists, jailed for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in Kuwait in December 1983, are no longer in Kuwaiti
hands.
   At least two witnesses who escaped from Kuwait when the Iraqis
invaded said they saw the terrorists getting into cars before the
Iraqis reached Kuwait's central prison.
   The 15 were mostly Iraqi Shiites opposed to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein, but they included two Lebanese Shiites related to
Islamic Jihad leaders. The prisoners were apparently set free by
their guards.
   Shiite sources have reported that the two Lebanese terrorists,
whom Islamic Jihad particularly wanted freed, were now back in
Lebanon.
   Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, recently helped crush a
rebellion by a Lebanese Christian general, but neither the Syrians
nor the Lebanese army has challenged the fundamentalists in their
Beirut strongholds where the Western hostages have been held.
   One Shiite source, who is familiar with the kidnappers'
thinking, said the issue of the American captives has become ``a
puzzle.''
   ``The American military deployment in the gulf makes it
embarrassing for Iran to pressure the captors into releasing
Americans,'' he said, adding that even Iranian moderates such as
President Hashemi Rafsanjani would find such a move difficult.
   ``Of course, the kidnappers are pro-Iranian and can be
influenced by Iran, but one shouldn't forget that America has been
the Great Satan in Iran's eyes since Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
rose to power in 1979,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, has been
seeking to have all the Westerners freed in line with his drive to
improve Tehran's relations with the West and attract badly needed
investment and advanced technology. But he is opposed by Iran's
anti-Western radicals.

   The House agreed Friday to spend $1.3 billion
over the next eight years toward completing the Washington area
subway system.
   The legislation, passed by voice vote, calls for local
governments to provide $780 million as their portion of
constructing 13.5 miles of Metro's green line.
   The bill, already approved by the Senate, goes to President
Bush, who is expected to sign it.
   Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the District of Columbia
Committee, called the subway ``an essential part of the national
capital transportation system.''
   He said the portion to be completed ``serves the most
transit-dependent population'' in the area.
   ``It is unfortunate that the neediest will be the last to have
access to mass transit,'' said Dellums, noting that the first
sections of the system served more affluent areas.

   Trailing by 40 points in the polls,
Republican Gov. Edward D. DiPrete is up against two tough
opponents.
   One is Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun. The other, more formidable
according to political scientists, is the region's battered
economy.
   ``I would say it's almost impossible for Gov. DiPrete to come
back,'' says Brown University political scientist Darrell West.
``Whether he deserves it or not, people are tying him to the
economy.''
   DiPrete is quick to pull out a Moody's credit report that says
the state's long-term fiscal management has been solid, although
the current budget threatens to hemorrhage red ink.
   ``I wouldn't concede it's out of anyone's control, but it's
certainly making it more difficult for us to get our message out,''
a subdued DiPrete said.
   His consultant, Paul J. Manafort, the architect of President
Bush's victory, says that if voters don't buy the
forget-the-past-I-am-the-future message: ``I wouldn't say we're
dead. We just don't win.''
   DiPrete portrays Sundlun's promise to slash millions of dollars
of waste from the $1.5 billion state budget as Draconian, cutting
into services needed by the poor and elderly. But fiscal experts
within and outside government suggest DiPrete may have to do the
same thing.
   The governor, seeking his fourth two-year term, says he alone
has enough experience to lead Rhode Island through a recession -
and that he is the bulwark against Democrats who dominate every
other Statehouse office and the General Assembly.
   He's proposed sweeping ethics and campaign finance reforms, a
broad restructuring of state government and apologized for any
mistakes he might have made.
   But the reaction generally has been: Why not before this?
   ``He's running an election where Paul Manafort can't control the
agenda,'' said one of the state's highest Republican officeholders,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``To make it work, he's got to
raise Bruce Sundlun's negatives, and it just won't fly.''
   DiPrete, 56, has spent more than $2 million and Bush twice has
attended fund-raising events. Sundlun, a millionaire businessman
who largely finances his own campaigns, has spent about $3 million
in the race, including the cost of the bitter three-way primary he
won Sept. 11.
   Sundlun, 71, never known for the light touch in two previous
campaigns against DiPrete, has played like an incumbent while
contending he's not a professional politician. But he's is trying
to guard against cockiness.
   ``One of the problems I have right now is that the media is
trying to make me the governor, and I'm leaning over backwards not
to be the governor,'' he said. ``That would be presumptuous.''
   It's that touch of overconfidence that DiPrete hopes will cause
Sundlun to make a major gaffe.
   ``I'm playing the role of the underdog,'' DiPrete said. ``And
yet I think I can reverse this if I can pull him out a little.''
   But it won't mean much if people don't vote, and there's every
indication they may not rush to the polls Nov. 6.
   There were 12,300 requests for mail ballots in 1988. This year,
the number of requests is down by 5,000.
   However, there were 4,000 ballot requests for the September
primary, twice the usual number.
   ``They were mad in September,'' said Henry Kinch, an aide to
Secretary of State Kathleen Connell. ``Now, they're just fed up.''

announced this week.
   The Society of the Cincinnati, which owns the 18th-century house

<TEXT>
   Two top Minnesota Republican leaders
today urged GOP candidate Jon Grunseth to drop out of the
governor's race, hours after Grunseth had been on the brink of
doing so before changing his mind.
   Grunseth, whose campaign has been crippled by allegations that
he swam nude with teen-age girls nine years ago, called a news
conference Thursday to announce he was dropping out of the race but
switched at the last minute.
   Senate Minority Leader Duane Benson and House Minority Leader
Bill Schreiber held a news conference at the Capitol today to
publicly urge Grunseth to leave the field to state Auditor Arne
Carlson, a Republican running as a write-in candidate.
   ``My message here today is a very simple one, that Jon
Grunseth's candidacy is hurting the entire ticket,'' said Benson.
   ``Senator Benson and I are of one mind on this issue,'' said
Schreiber. ``There is no question that the governor's race is
bringing down politics in Minnesota to a level never before
experienced.''
   Grunseth, 44, who held up his news conference for more than
three hours while he reconsidered late Thursday, said he had
definitely decided to quit the race earlier in the day.
   ``But there has been just an incredible outpouring of love and
affection and support and prayer,'' he said. ``We spent hours
agonizing over this decision, and we decided about a half-hour ago
that we were going to press forward no matter what.''
   The decision leaves next month's gubernatorial election a
three-way race between the Grunseth, Carlson and Democratic
incumbent Rudy Perpich.
   Carlson lost to Grunseth in the Republican primary. He mounted
his write-in effort after fellow Republicans began to urge Grunseth
to quit the race.
   Grunseth's campaign was thrown into turmoil Oct. 15 when it was
reported that two women said in sworn statements that he tried to
get them to swim nude with him during a 1981 pool party at his
home.
   The women, who were then 13 and 14, said they refused but that
Grunseth, his teen-age daughter and a 16-year-old girl took off
their bathing suits. One of the women also said Grunseth tried to
pull down her bathing suit top and touch her breast.
   Grunseth has denied the allegations.
   Some Republicans complained Thursday that his decision not to
quit could give the Nov. 6 election to Perpich, who seeks an
unprecedented fourth term.
   ``If he can't have it his way he'll take the whole business down
to catastrophe,'' said former Gov. Elmer L. Andersen, a Carlson
supporter.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., indicated earlier in the day that
the Republican Party couldn't unseat Perpich with two candidates.
   ``Our base simply is not big enough to cut it in half,'' he
said. ``So that we're going to have to some way repair that
situation.''
   Perpich was preparing for tonight's debate with Grunseth and
Carlson and was unavailable for comment, spokesman Ray Bohn said
today.
   A member of Grunseth's finance committee said that after
Grunseth told 15 to 20 committee members he was dropping out, they
tried to get him to change his mind.
   ``Jon told us he definitely was not going to stay in,'' said Rod
Hendrickson. ``But after some very persuasive conversations by
certain members, we felt he was going to reconsider.''
   Committee members told Grunseth they would provide him an
additional $200,000 in campaign funds if he would remain in the
race, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported today.
   One contributor offered Grunseth $90,000 if he would stay in the
running, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported. Campaign manager
Leon Oistad said Grunseth won't hold that person to the offer,
which was made in the emotion of the moment, but the campaign would
welcome it.

<HEAD>Cubans Don't Know It but Soviet Daily Says Castro Has Wife, 5 Kids</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unbeknownst to the Cuban people, President
Fidel Castro has a wife with whom he has had five children, a
Soviet newspaper says. He also has 32 houses and 9,700 guards
responsible for his personal security, it says.
   These tidbits - all unverifiable - about Castro's personal life
appeared in a recent edition of Komsomolskaya Pravda, a leading
liberal daily in Moscow. They added a new dimension to the trend
toward more candid reporting about Cuba in the Soviet press.
   ``This is the most biting article yet because it goes after
Fidel Castro personally,'' one Bush administration official said. A
translation of the article appeared in a U.S. government
publication that monitors the foreign media.
   Castro's private life is a mystery to the Cuban public. Cubans
are aware that he was married in the late 1940s, has a son,
Fidelito, by that marriage, and that he was divorced in the
mid-1950s.
   ``All details concerning the personal life of Fidel Castro and
the whole party-state elite in Cuba are shrouded in an impenetrable
veil of secrecy,'' begins the article by A. Novikov.
   It said that apart from Fidelito, Castro also has an
illegitimate daughter, Alina Fernandez Revuelta, about 34 years
old.
   Castro's ``present wife'' works in the Cuban Institute of
Oceanography and they have five sons, all of whom have first names
starting with ``A'' - Aloin, Alex, Anatolio and so on, the story
said.
   The sons all studied in the Soviet Union, it said, and were
taken care of by a married couple who were Cuban state security
employees.
   Some details in the article were corroborated by Georgie Ann
Geyer, a syndicated columnist who has written a soon-to-be-released
biography of Castro, ``Guerrilla Prince, The Untold Story of Fidel
Castro.''
   The woman referred to in the article apparently is Daria Soto
del Valle, Ms. Geyer said. She, too, said that the couple has
produced five children and added that her research indicates Castro
may have fathered 14 or more offspring over the years.
   Explaining Castro's passion for secrecy, Ms. Geyer said, ``A
charismatic leader's power depends on his not being known.''
   The Komsomolskaya Pravda article continued: ``Fidel has 32
houses (state houses, of course) scattered around the whole
country. In Havana, he has three houses and two underground
bunkers, where, if need be, the commander in chief can hide,
together with his retinue of 57 generals.''
   The account apparently touched a raw nerve in Cuba. When a
Mexican television crew in Moscow reported on the story earlier
this week, Cuban authorities retaliated by expelling a crew from
the same network which was on assignment in Havana.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda is described as a leading practitioner of
the new wave journalism introduced in recent years in the Soviet
Union. It is a supporter of the country's best known radical
politician, Boris Yeltsin, who is president of the Russian
Republic.
   U.S. officials said the details of Castro's personal life
apparently were leaked to the publication by Soviet officials who
believe Moscow should loosen its ties to Cuba.
   Relations remain outwardly cordial but trade between the two
countries has fallen sharply, partly because of the economic chaos
in the Soviet Union.
   The story said that the marriage of Castro's brother, Raul,
broke down five years ago but the couple still appear together in
public. Raul is No. 2 in the Cuban hierarchy.
   ``At the moment, Raul is `illegally' married to a Bulgarian
woman and apart from this, has an illegitimate daughter by a woman
who is the director of Cuban television,'' it said.
   None of the contentions in the article could be verified
independently.
   The article says that Castro's personal guard numbers 9,700
people throughout the country, 2,800 of whom are in the capital.
   But when he visits any province, the deployment of additional
units can mean that up to 28,000 people are mobilized for ``the
security of one single person,'' it said.
   When Castro goes bathing or sailing on one of his three yachts,
122 divers ``comb the sea bed inch by inch in search of underwater
mines and traps,'' it added.
   Cuban officials have justified the tight security around Castro
by citing U.S.-sponsored assassination attempts against him. A
Senate study 15 years ago concluded ther were eight such attempts
while Castro himself has put the figure at 25.

   President Bush today blamed Democrats for
the higher taxes his administration is negotiating with lawmakers,
saying the Democratic-controlled Congress ``has been on an
uncontrolled spending binge for years.''
   Bush, who promised during his presidential campaign he would not
support tax increases, said he was forced to compromise to get a
deficit-reduction agreement through the House and Senate.
   Noting that Democrats for 36 years have controlled the House, he
said that ``year after year after year they have presided over
these budget deficits and they appropriate every dime and they tell
me how to spend every dime.''
   ``Yes I've had to compromise, haven't liked that a bit, but I've
done it because the president must at certain times put the overall
good of the country first,'' he told a fund-raising breakfast for
the California Republican Party.
   In accepting his presidential nomination at the 1988 Republican
National Convention, Bush said: ``And the Congress will push me to
raise taxes, and I'll say no, and they'll push, and I'll say no,
and they'll push again. And I'll say to them: Read my lips. No new
taxes.''
   Bush complained that a top Democrat was criticising his
leadership in this morning's newspaper - apparently a reference to
statements by Rep. Richard Gephardt published today in The
Washington Post.
   ``I think George Bush can be beaten in 1992,'' said Gephardt,
House majority leader. ``In the last two months, he's shown a real
failure of leadership. He needed to explain to the American people
why they were being asked to swallow strong medicine, but he didn't
do it.''
   Bush said, ``The American people know that strong medicine ...
is required because the Democratic Congress simply has been on an
uncontrolled spending binge for years. You don't have to be a
rocket scientist to know that Congress has been spending more than
we take in for far too long.
   ``The (deficit-reduction) agreement that we get won't be the
best deal possible but in my judgement it will be the best deal
possible with this Congress,'' he said.
   Bush was to appear later at a campaign luncheon for Sen. Pete
Wilson, California's GOP gubernatorial candidate running against
former Democratic Mayor Dianne Feinstein of San Francisco.
   Wilson did not attend this morning's breakfast, speaking instead
by telephone loudspeaker. He said he stayed in Washington to work
on the budget negotiations which are nearing completion.
   In the budget fight, members of the president's own party
defected from the bipartisan package he approved earlier because it
contained tax increases.
   Charles Black, spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said earlier that Bush was preparing a new, ``partisan sharp
message'' but holding off on the most venomous anti-Democratic
rhetoric until the bipartisan budget agreement was signed.
   After his California appearances, the president was heading to
Hawaii to stump for Senate candidate Rep. Pat Saiki, and meet with
leaders of 11 Pacific island nations. En route home, he will make
another stop for Wilson in San Francisco and then in Oklahoma to
campaign for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Price.
   Bush delayed his Thursday departure and canceled stops in
Arizona and New Mexico while final details of the budget pact were
nailed down.
   His trip ends Monday, just a week before election eve, and
continues his pattern of helping Republicans whose loyalty to him
has been selective.
   Wilson and Saiki have bucked the White House on key issues. Both
helped defeat the deficit-reduction pact, backed by Bush, that was
the forerunner to the package emerging this week.
   Wilson, in a neck-and-neck race against Democrat Dianne
Feinstein, issued a statement at the time saying its ``tax hikes
will only encourage Congress to spend more and more.''
   Saiki also voted for the sweeping civil rights legislation that
Bush vetoed. She was preparing to vote to override his veto before
the override was killed in the Senate, her office said.
   In a related development Thursday, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater all but invited the National Republican Congressional
Committee to fire co-chairman Edward J. Rollins for a recent memo
in which he told House GOP candidates: ``Do not hesitate to oppose
either the president or (budget) proposals advanced in Congress.''
   Fitzwater said Rollins' remarks ``were not helpful. I think the
... committee will be able to take charge of this situation.''
Asked whether Rollins should be dismissed, he said: ``That's up to
the committee.''

<HEAD>European Leaders Will Hold Summit on Gulf, Trade, Political Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   European Community leaders get their
first formal chance this weekend to discuss the Persian Gulf
crisis, but their talks may be overshadowed by a sharp clash over
plans for modest cuts in farm subsidies.
   The leaders of the dozen West European nations will open a
mini-summit Saturday evening at the Palazzo Madama, or Italian
senate, in Rome and wind it up Sunday morning. Italy holds the
community's rotating presidency.
   During the eight hours of talks, they are expected to cover
issues ranging from the gulf crisis and troubles in the Soviet
Union to futuristic plans for giving the community a single voice
in foreign policy.
   But the meeting could turn sour if the leaders are forced to
break a deadlock over a community proposal for snipping farm
subsidies by 30 percent over 10 years.
   Such a discussion would be ``totally unproductive and I would
even say disastrous,'' said Jacques Delors, president of the
community's executive body.
   But British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is expected to
raise the issue if agriculture and trade ministers are unable to
end the dispute before the summit. ``It would be disastrous not to
have it on the agenda,'' said a British source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose government faces elections
in December, opposes the plan for farm cuts. His aides insist on
special aid to offset any income losses suffered by farmers.
   Germany's action, backed by France and Ireland, has threatened
the ambitious Uruguay round of international trade talks, a
four-year effort to revamp the world trade system. Final bargaining
will begin in five weeks.
   The leaders are expected to discuss the gulf situation and
possibly aid to Jordan, Turkey and Egypt, hard hit by the trade
embargo on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait. The leaders have
discussed the issue in bilateral talks but not all together.
   The economic woes of the Soviet Union and the new democracies in
Eastern Europe also will be on the agenda, although new aid offers
appear unlikely.
   At a June summit in Dublin, the leaders asked aides to put
together proposals for short-term loans and other assistance for
the Kremlin.
   But community officials say they are not ready. The work has
been hampered by the Soviets' lack of statistics and delay in
adopting an economic reform plan. They also say the Soviet Union,
the world's largest crude oil producer, will be helped by the
recent surge in oil prices.
   The leaders may spar, as in the past, over far-reaching plans to
form a political merger with a common foreign and security policy
and an economic and monetary union with a joint currency and
central bank.
   Special conferences will open in mid-December to make changes in
the community's founding Treaty of Rome to set out new powers.
   Mrs. Thatcher has opposed some of the more radical suggestions
for joining forces with her allies on the continent, arguing
against giving up national powers to new institutions.
   ``We see no prospect of a United States of Europe,'' she said in
an interview with London's Independent newspaper.
   ``But there are many practical ways in which Europe can grow
together,'' she said. ``The community should not stand still.''
   She is certain to oppose a push by Italian Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti to set a date, likely Jan. 1, 1994, for the start of work
on a central bank.
   Moreover, Andreotti, according to spokesman Pio Mastrobuoni,
will urge support for eventual creation of a single currency - an
idea flatly rejected by Mrs. Thatcher.
   Turning to political union, a new Italian report said the
community ``is increasingly a major factor of stability in Europe
and one of the major players in international affairs.''
   ``It will be able to fully play this role only if it acquires
stronger unity and (can act) with its own identity on the
international scene,'' the report said.
   Germany, aware of fears the newly united nation will become too
powerful, supports closer political ties. ``It is essential for us
that we strengthen Europe,'' said a German source, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   But Britain and France want to retain a good deal of power in
their own hands, while smaller countries worry about being left
out.
   ``Our interests would be better protected in an organized
structure where there is room for everybody, not just the larger
countries,'' a Dutch official said.
   Some want the community to take on a defense role, too. Italian
Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis wants the community to adopt
the Western European Union, a security grouping of nine EC nations.
   But neutral Ireland would balk at any attempt to turn the
community into a military powerhouse, while close U.S. allies
oppose moves to weaken the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<HEAD>Ohio Supreme Court Reinstates Convictions Of Two In Collapse Of
Ohio Thrift</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ohio Supreme Court today reinstated
the convictions of the former owner and the former president of
Home State Savings Bank, whose whose failure five years ago
triggered a state savings and loan crisis.
   Marvin Warner and David Schiebel were convicted of charges
relating to the collapse of the Cincinnati-based Home State, of
which Warner was owner and Schiebel president. The convictions were
overturned last year by a state appeals court.
   Home State collapsed on March 8, 1985, four days after ESM
Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was declared
insolvent. Home State lost $144 million through its securities
transactions with ESM.
   Home State's collapse caused a run on the state's 69 other Ohio
savings and loans institutions whose deposits were insured by the
Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund. The privately owned, state-chartered
fund was similar to the federal deposit insurance agencies.
   The crisis forced Gov. Richard Celeste to temporarily close the
thrifts and order them to obtain federal deposit insurance or merge
with companies that had federal protection before they could
reopen.
   Warner was convicted of nine felonies - six counties of
misapplying about $14 million in bank money through unauthorized
payments to ESM and three counts of securities violations. He was
acquitted of 76 other counts.
   Schiebel was found guilty of three securities violations.
   The convictions on March 2, 1987, came in a four-month trial in
Hamilton County Common Pleas Court.
   Warner had been sentenced to 3{ years in prison and Schiebel to
six months, but both were free on bond pending their appeals.
   Another former president of the thrift, Burton Bongard, was
convicted of 82 counts of missapplication and unauthorized transfer
of funds. Bongard later pleaded guilty to loan violations and
received a 4{-year prison sentence. He was released from prison in
July 1989 on probation.
   A three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati overturned the convictions of Warner and Schiebel on
Nov. 15, 1989.
   The court reversed Warner's and Schiebel's convictions on the
three securities counts that alleged they covered up Home State's
precarious financial position in circulars distributed to raise
money for Home State's operations in 1984. That portion of the case
was sent back to the lower court for possible new trial.
   In its ruling that was reversed today, the appeals court also
dismissed Warner's convictions on the six counts that he oversaw
unauthorized transfers of Home State money to ESM. The court said
the state did not present sufficient evidence.
   The appellate court also threw out the lower court's order that
Warner pay $22 million in restitution to Ohio and $250,000 in court
costs, and that Schiebel pay $25,000 in court costs.

   Congress' struggle to find $20 billion in
spending cuts this year as a part of a five-year, $500 billion
deficit-reduction plan is not stopping lawmakers from taking care
of their home states and districts.
   Indiana Rep. John Myers, the top Republican on the House
Appropriations subcommittee on energy and water projects, got $4.8
million for a new technology center at Indiana State University.
   Another subcommittee member, Rep. Wes Watkins, D-Okla., got $5
million for a technology research center at Oklahoma State
University. Yet another, Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., got $5.7
million for biochemistry and chemical engineering research at the
University of Nebraska.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., got $10 million
for biomedical research. Its No. 2 Democrat, Rep. Lindy Boggs of
Louisiana, also got $10 million, for an energy research park at the
University of New Orleans.
   None of the spending had been sought by the Bush Administration
or authorized by any House committees with jurisdiction over
scientific research.
   All of it, plus another $45 million that key members of the
Senate Appropriations Committee wanted, showed up in a negotiated
compromise between the two houses directing President Bush just
where to spend Department of Energy funds next year.
   ``This is research that has to be done,'' Myers maintains.
``Maybe they are located in some of the districts of
(appropriations committee) members, but we know more about them
there.''
   But to many of the 449 members of Congress who don't hold seats
on the House or Senate Appropriations Committees, the 29 senators
and 57 who do often abuse their power of the purse in directing
just where $183 billion for various domestic programs will be spent
in fiscal 1991.
   ``I'm over outrage; I'm into nausea,'' says Rep. Robert Walker
of Pennsylvania. ``The fact is that when we are allocating money,
it is not based upon merit other than the people who are sitting in
the room divvying up the money.''
   Walker, the top Republican on the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee, tried in vain last week to stop what he
called ``the unauthorized pork-barrel projects.''
   The House voted against him nearly 3-to-1. ``The word on the
floor'' was ``you, better be with us on this, or we're going to
take a look at your projects, too,'' he said.
   Sometimes lawmakers' efforts involve more than just getting
money for their home states and often it requires more than a
single year's effort.
   For example, Hawaii Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, the No. 2 Democrat on
the Senate Appropriations Committee, got $5 million for his state's
Department of Business and Economic Development to verify potential
geothermal resource sites.
   But he also set in motion getting $50 million next year to help
pay for renovating the medical center of George Washington
University in Washington.
   A graduate of the university's law school and now a member of
its board of trustees, Inouye got the Senate last week to authorize
a $50 million grant for the school as part of the Medical Devices
Act.
   An aide to him described it as a ``lure'' to help the university
raise $100 million in matching funds from its alumni so that Inouye
can seek actual appropriations for the project next year as part of
the fiscal 1992 budget.
   The unabashed champion of directing federal money to his home
state is Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the president pro-tempore
of the Senate and Democratic chairman of its Appropriations
Committee.
   A 32-year Senate veteran, he gave up the more prestigious
majority leader's job two years ago to succeed retiring Mississippi
Sen. John Stennis as appropriations chairman ``where I can best
serve the people of my state.''
   Byrd included $10 million for Alzheimer's research at West
Virginia University in the measure that Walker tried to stop. He
also helped ax $55 million that President Bush wanted for hiring
1,000 new IRS agents to instead build a new $80 million federal
courthouse in Charleston.
   And last spring, he won $185 million to relocate the FBI's
fingerprint laboratory, ``a law enforcement priority that would
have to be built somewhere,'' from Washington to Clarksburg, W.Va.
   ``My proposals for West Virginia come under the sharpest
scrutiny, more so because I'm the chairman,'' Byrd said this week,
citing the depressed economy in his state. ``This nation must
invest in its infrastructure, its research and its people .... My
efforts to strengthen West Virginia's economic bases reflect that
belief.''

<HEAD>Child's Report of Brother's Fatal Beating Dismissed by Emergency
Operator</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An emergency operator told a 7-year-old girl to
``get off the phone'' when she called to report her brother being
fatally beaten, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Troy and Jane McCants pleaded guilty Thursday to involuntary
manslaughter in the June death of their 6-year-old son, Antwon
Dumas. The couple originally was charged with second-degree murder.
   The plea agreement was prompted in part by records showing their
daughter's 911 emergency call was ignored, The Detroit News said.
   ``My brother been murdered,'' Iyesha McCants told a 911
operator, according to police recordings.
   The operator responded, ``Get off the phone, ... get off the
phone right now,'' according to the newspaper. It said the girl's
continued pleadings were obscured by the operator's voice telling
her to hang up.
   Jane McCants called for an ambulance five minutes later,
according to the tape, but the boy was dead when the ambulance
arrived.
   Authorities said they were not certain whether the boy could
have been saved five minutes earlier.
   Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hair said the operator, who
wasn't identified, has been disciplined. O'Hair would not say what
measures were taken.
   Judge Robert Ziolkowski ordered the McCants to undergo a
psychiatric evaluation and set sentencing for Nov. 5. The couple
could receive 15 years in prison.
   At a preliminary hearing in July, Iyesha McCants testified that
her parents had three extension cords they used to beat her
brother. She said her mother beat him with a leather belt the day
he died.
   Assistant Prosecutor Nancy Diehl said the guilty pleas will save
the girl from the trauma of testifying again.
   ``One young life was ended needlessly,'' Diehl said. ``We do not
want to harm another.''

<HEAD>Israeli Report Blames Police for Indiscriminate Firing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with final pages of report saying police
fired indiscriminately during Temple Mount masscre. No pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Israeli investigation into the Temple Mount
killings said today that police use of live ammunition was
justified but that there was indiscrimnnate shooting.
   The probe severely criticized Israel's police chief and
Jerusalem's two top officers for ignoring advance signs of trouble
at the holy site.
   The three-man commission also that Palestinians provoked the
riot, but that police showed little sensitivity to the Temple Mount
as a holy place for Jews and for Moslems, who call it Haram
es-Sharif.
   The report said that when police broke into the Temple Mount
compound to confront Palestinian rioters, ``there was
indiscriminate use of live ammunition.''
   It said the use of live ammunition ``was unavoidable'' to rescue
two policemen thought to be trapped in a station on the Temple
Mount and to secure their armory of three submachine guns and 43
pistols.
   However, the report did not give details of the indiscriminate
shooting, discussing it only in general terms near the end of the
59-page report and not even mentioning it in the report's main
conclusions.
   But the report implied that police may have fired when they were
not in danger and may have continued firing after it was no longer
necessary to gain control of the area. ``The use of live fire was
without strict supervision by officers,'' it said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir named the commission two days
after the rioting on Oct. 8 to examine what led to the
confrontation, which began after Arabs stoned Jews praying at the
Western Wall, below the Temple Mount.
   Police said at the time that 19 Palestinians were killed and
more than 140 wounded in Israeli gunfire, but today's report said
20 were killed.
   The massacre prompted two U.N. Security Council resolutions,
both of which brought the United States into conflict with Israel,
its closest ally in the Middle East. The United States was the
chief sponsor of a resolution approved Oct. 12 by the Council that
condemned Israel for the shooting deaths of the Palestinians on the
Temple Mount and called for a U.N. investigation.
   The United States voted against Israel again on Wednesday for
refusing to admit U.N. investigators.
   Israel fears accepting the U.N. mission would be tantamount to
accepting world objections to Israel's annexation of predominantly
Arab east Jerusalem, captured with the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip in the 1967 war.
   Israel had said its internal investigation will be adequate.
   Today's report justified the police use of force to capture the
area up to the line of the two mosques on the Temple Mount, but
questioned whether police needed to go north of the line and make
arrests.
   ``Groups and individuals acted on their own judgment north of
the line of the mosques,'' it said. Some of them ran into
``difficult situations'' and had to open fire. ``But it is doubtful
whether the cleaning up of the area and the conduct of arrests ...
was essential in the conditions that prevailed on the Mount,'' the
report said.
   It said that the force that charged onto the Mount was
unsupervised, put together at random and not fully briefed.
   The report referred without elaboration to ``initiatives'' taken
by commanders after the stabilization of the mosque area.
   These could be justified in an emergency, it said, ``but on the
Temple Mount, because of its distinctiveness and in non-emergency
conditions, such an initiative is dangerous.''
   It cited one such case, saying: ``We did not find that this
officer's initiative caused injury or loss of life, but the action
remains grave.''
   The report said police had prior reports of the possibility of
riots on the Temple Mount. It said police commanders failed to
recognize passions aroused by the 34-month-old Palestinian
uprising, Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, and ``the inflammatory
calls'' of Moslem clerics a week earlier to block a rumored march
to the Mount by Jewish zealots.
   The report criticized the top police echelon for being absent
even when it became obvious a dangerous situation was brewing.
   Jerusalem Police Commander Aryeh Bibi ``should have hurried
immediately to the Temple Mount,'' while Jerusalem District
Commander Rahamim Comfort should have joined him ``to supervise the
situation personally,'' the report said.
   It said the police ``who were attacked by an incited mob ...
feared for their lives and the lives of tens of thousands
worshipers who were at the Western Wall for a holiday prayer.
   ``After the massive pelting with stones and other materials, the
police fired (tear) gas grenades and rubber bullets and hoped this
would deter the rampaging crowd and force it some way back from the
Western Wall,'' the report said.
   It said the police fell back through a gate leading out of the
mosque compound, which the Arabs then blocked while continuing to
throw stones at the Western Wall, also known as the Wailing Wall.
   The police, having fled, then heard over their walkie-talkies
``a desperate cry'' for rescue by two policemen manning a regular
post inside the compound, which also contains ``dozens of weapons
and ammunition,'' the report said.
   The police charged back into the compound, not knowing the two
officers were by now safe, and used ``gas grenades and even live
fire as the crowd bombarded them with rocks and other materials
that threatened their lives.''
   ``It was at this stage that the heavy losses of life were caused
among those congregated on the Mount and when the congregants went
into the mosques an order to cease fire was given,'' the report
said.

<HEAD>International Poll Watchers: No Evidence to Support Fraud Claims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ZAHID HUSSAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International poll watchers said Friday
they found no evidence to support ousted Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto's claims that her party lost a parliamentary election
because of widespread voter fraud.
   Ms. Bhutto rejected the findings and declared: ``Today we have a
constitutional dictator after an electoral coup d'etat.''
   The winning alliance said it hoped the investigation would
persuade Washington to resume vital economic and military aid to
Pakistan.
   Ms. Bhutto's center-left Pakistan People's Party was defeated by
the right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance more than 2-1 in
Wednesday's election.
   The 37-year-old former premier, whose government was dismissed
Aug. 6 on corruption and mismanagement charges, has refused to
concede defeat. She has accused the army-backed caretaker
government and her opponents of massive vote-rigging and said she
will challenge the election results in court.
   The alliance, a loose-knit coalition of 18 parties, called Ms.
Bhutto a sore loser and said such large-scale tampering would be
impossible.
   At a news conference in this southern port city, a 40-member
observer team from the Washington-based National Democratic
Institute said it had found no evidence to support Ms. Bhutto's
claims.
   ``We have not found any evidence of irregularities which could
have altered the outcome of the elections significantly. Voting
took place in a peaceful and positive atmopshere,'' said Vahit
Halefaglu, a prominent Turkish diplomat and leader of the
delegation.
   Halefaglu said the team, which monitored 30 constituencies
nationwide, would probably release its final report in about three
months.
   The institute sent observers from 18 countries to monitor the
election of a new National Assembly, the law-making lower house of
Parliament that will choose Pakistan's next prime minister.
   Earlier this week, a 15-member team from India, Nepal, Sri Lanka
and Bangladesh said its preliminary findings showed the poll was
fair and free.
   Both teams will monitor legislative elections in Pakistan's four
provinces Saturday, seen as a test of strength for the alliance and
a measure of the erosion of Ms. Bhutto's popularity.
   Ms. Bhutto's lawyer and former interior minister, Aitzaz Ahsan,
said the People's Party stands by its claims regardless of the
institute's findings.
   ``The tampering is self-evident. If then NDI is saying this was
a fair election, then the NDI hasn't seen anything,'' Ahsan said.
   Sartaj Aziz, finance minister in the caretaker government and an
alliance member, said he hoped the institute's initial findings
would reinforce the notion that Pakistan's political institutions
are able to hold free, fair elections.
   The United States and other Western countries had threatened to
cut off hundreds of millions of dollars in economic and military
aid if the election was rigged and Ms. Bhutto victimized.
   Earlier this month, Washington suspended a $573 million aid
package because Pakistan had not given enough guarantees that it
did not possess or want to possess nuclear weapons.
   Before asssitance resumes, Congress has demanded certification
that this week's polls were free and fair.
   Halefaglu said that although the group did not rule out the
possibility of some rigging, the voting overall was orderly and
peaceful.
   ``Despite these positive conditions, the election process was
not without problems,'' he said,
   The team found the monthlong election campaign was conducted in
a highly polarized political environment, he said. That was in part
because of the dismissal of Ms. Bhutto's government and the
establishment of special tribunals to try her and members of her
government for corruption.
   Halefaglu was critical of election coverage by state-run
television, saying it was heavily biased in favor of the caretaker
government.
   He also said the team had received complaints of party workers
being killed, reports of armed attacks on election officials and of
ballot boxes being switched.
   The team is investigating complaints and also comparing the
final ballot count to voter lists, Halefaglu said. Even if the
complaints were proved, he said, it would not have altered the
outcome.

<HEAD>Transplant Patient Starts Breathing On Her Own</HEAD>

   A 12-year-old girl was breathing on her own
Friday after receiving part of her mother's lung in what's believed
to be the nation's first live-donor lung transplant, hospital
officials said.
   The operation offers hope to perhaps hundreds of children a year
who suffer from certain lung diseases because transplanted tissue
from a relative reduces the risk of rejection, said Dr. Vaughn
Starnes, who led the surgical team.
   Mother and daughter remained in good condition a day after
surgeons replaced the daughter's right lung with a lobe removed
from the mother's right lung, said Joyce B. Thomas, a spokeswoman
for Stanford Medical Center.
   ``Both are doing fine,'' Thomas said.
   The mother started breathing on her own shortly after the
four-hour operation Thursday.
   Doctors had given the girl 12-18 more months to live, but they
now expect her to fully recover. Doctors expect the girl to remain
hospitalized for several weeks. The mother will probably go home
earlier.
   Doctors said its likely the transplanted lung will expand
capacity and may even grow.
   ``The girl probably won't be a sprinter, but certainly she can
go to school, participate in games and activities and go on dates,
do all the normal things that kids can do,'' Stanford spokesman
Mike Goodkind said.
   The mother's lifestyle is not expected to be changed by the
procedure, Goodkind said.
   ``Very commonly, for lung cancer for example, an entire lung is
removed. People can function normally with one lung,'' Goodkind
said.
   Transplants from related, live donors are important for children
because they have a higher rate of rejection than adults, which
``might have something to do with their more active immune
systems,'' Starnes said.
   The most likely benefactors are patients with a large hole in
the diaphragm, high blood pressure on the lung or scarring of the
lung, said Goodkind.
   ``The fact is this is not a procedure that would have wide
application for millions of people. It is a specific treatment for
a select group of child patients who are terminally ill,'' Goodkind
said.
   ``The fact that it was a live-donor transplant was, in this
case, subordinate to the idea that the recipient was so closely
related to the donor.''
   The 46-year-old mother and her child matched on four of six
genetic markers, or tissue antigens, compared to no more than two
such matches in Stanford's previous brain dead-donor lung and heart
transplants, Starnes said.
   Seven of 14 children who have received heart-lung transplants at
Stanford suffered rejection severe enough to impair lung function.
That's nearly twice the rejection rate of 71 adults who have
undergone the same operation, according to Stanford.
   The girl suffers from a rare malady called bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, which causes scarring of the lungs and high blood
pressure. The condition was the result of being placed on a
respirator after being born prematurely, said Goodkind.
   The malady also affects her remaining left lung, but won't
impair the transplanted tissue, Goodkind said.
   The patients' names were withheld at the family's request.

   Saddam Hussein is seeking to make peace with Iraq's Kurdish
minority, a Baghdad newspaper said today. The Kurds have in the
past been the target of poison gas attacks and forcible relocation
by the Baghdad government.
   Saddam's reported bid to reconcile with the Kurds comes several
weeks after the Iraqi president made peace with another
longstanding foe, Iran, so he could move tens of thousands of
troops from the Iranian border to occupied Kuwait and the Saudi
Arabian border.
   It was not immediately clear why Saddam would want to placate
the Kurdish minority, but he may want to eliminate all internal
opposition to prepare for possible combat with the multinational
force arrayed against him.
   The Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait have arrested two Americans
who had been hiding in the occupied emirate to avoid internment in
Saddam ``human shield,'' Western diplomats disclosed today.
   Uwe Jahnke, 47, of Washington Depot, Conn., and John Stevenson,
44, of Panama City, Fla., were brought to Baghdad on Oct. 22, a day
after their arrest in Kuwait, said the diplomats, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said the pair were taken to the government-run
Mansour-Melia Hotel, where scores of other foreigners are being
held.
   In another development, Iraq's foreign minister criticized the
United States and Britain, saying they were trying to block any
Arab solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Tariq Aziz, in remarks reported today by the official Iraqi News
Agency, also accused the U.S-led multinational force of seeking to
seize control of the region's oil resources.
   If the multinational force eventually moves to evict Iraq from
Kuwait and the emirate is destroyed in the process, that will not
be too high a price to pay for liberation, Kuwait's exiled prime
minister was quoted as saying today.
   ``What is left of Kuwait after what Saddam's soldiers did to
it?'' said Prime Minister Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah,
according to the Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat.
   ``As a citizen and a responsible official, I am ready to
sacrifice everything for the sake of regaining my land and
liberating it, and that is how each ordinary Kuwaiti thinks,'' said
Sheik Saad, who is also the crown prince.
   Kuwait's government-in-exile has also disclosed that casualties
from the invasion were far higher than initially reported. The
government-run Kuwait News Agency, monitored in Bahrain, said 4,200
Kuwaitis were killed during the invasion. Initial reports had said
several hundred died.
   The news agency, citing Kuwaiti government officials, also said
12,000 Kuwaiti soldiers weretaken prisoner, out of a total
pre-invasion Kuwaiti military force of about 20,000.
   Fears about war in the gulf sent oil prices up more than $3 per
barrel in the futures market Thursday. Light sweet crude rose $3.17
to $34.25 a barrel for December delivery contracts on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, a key market. It was crude oil's third-biggest
one-day jump in the Mideast crisis.
   When the market reopened today, oil prices jumped again, up 95
cents to $35.20 per barrel. ``It's definitely just the increased
war fears and seeing the war premium getting put back in the
market,'' Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc., said in New York.
   In the report about Saddam's effort to make peace with the
Kurds, the Baghdad newspaper, al-Jumhuriya, reported the Iraqi
president visited the northeastern Kurdish province of Suleimaniya
on Thursday. It said he walked the streets and prayed with
residents.
   ``Give us five years during which we will not resort to the
rifle and if we see that the situation is improving, we will go
ahead and bury the rifle and say that the issue has come to an
end,'' Saddam was quoted as telling one resident.
   There are up to 3.5 million Kurds in Iraq. They have campaigned
since the beginning of the century for an independent homeland
together with fellow Kurds in Iran and Turkey.
   Kurds were suspected of collaborating with Iran during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war that unofficially ended in 1988 and
Baghdad used poison gas to kill thousands of them. The killings
drew international outcry. Iraq also relocated thousands of Kurds
to areas away from the Iranian border region.
   Saddam is ready to use chemical weapons against if the
predominantly American multinational force in the gulf attacks him,
former Prime Minister Edward Heath has told British legislators,
Press Association reported today.
   Heath met with Saddam on Sunday and negotiated the release of 32
British passport holders.
   Britain's domestic news agency said Heath was understood to have
told Conservative Party lawmakers at a private meeting Thursday
that Saddam said he also would mistreat foreign hostages if
attacked.
   ``Mr. Heath is said to have expressed the view that the Iraqi
leader was ruthless, cold and calculating, but not mad,'' Press
Association reported.

<HEAD>Test Tube Hair Could Lead to Cure for Baldness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hair-raising experiment at Cambridge University
has raised hopes for bald men, but experts said Friday it could be
years before scientists can apply their test tube hair growth to
shiny heads.
   ``This is the real thing,'' said Dr. Terence Kealey, leader of
the research team which grew hair in a synthetic blood product at
the Department of Clinical Biochemistry.
   ``We have for the first time succeeded in getting hair to grow
in vitro,'' he said.
   The balding scientist stressed in a BBC radio interview that
growing hair in a test tube ``is not in itself a cure for
baldness.'' But, he added, it provides the perfect medium for
experiments and could lead to effective treatment within 10 years.
   The results of the research are to be published in the Journal
of Cell Science next month.
   Experts welcomed the achievement, saying it could lead to
preventing hair loss in men genetically disposed to baldness.
   ``Any knowledge of how hair grows and metabolizes could have
various offshoots in preventing baldness from happening,'' said Dr.
Ken Maxted, a dermatologist with the Glasgow Health Board who went
bald at 18.
   ``Whether it is a cure for people who are bald, I'm not quite
sure. I think it's rather nice having a waterproof head,'' he said
in an interview.
   Dr. John Firmage, a consultant at the Scalp and Hair Hospital in
London, said the research was an important first step to
understanding what affects hair growth and loss.
   ``Until now, it has been very difficult to know what happens''
except that the process of balding is hereditary, Dr. Firmage said.
``Hence the many lotions and potions which are produced.''
   Dr. John Romano at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in
New York said scientists would be able to test new chemicals on
test-tube hair without worrying about injuring someone's scalp.
   ``Researchers can use many more different chemicals because they
don't have to worry about toxicity,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Kealey said the next step is to find out why many middle-aged
men suffer a disruption in the normal mechanism that triggers the
growth of new, replacement hair.
   ``I hope that within 10 years we could come up with a cure for
baldness,'' he said.
   The successful growth of test tube hair came after a team
member, Dr. Michael Philpott, devised a method for extracting hair
follicles from the skin without damaging the roots, Kealey said.
   This is done by carefully slicing away the top two layers of
skin to remove hair follicles with fine tweezers. The follicles
then are grown in a synthetic blood substitute maintained at body
temperature, he said.
   Watching hair growing in a test tube is ``an amazing sight,''
Kealey said. ``It grows absolutely identical to normal hairs - at
the same rate of 0.012 inches a day and in the same shape.''
   The research was funded by the Anglo-Dutch consumer giant
Unilever and Britain's Science and Engineering Research Council, he
said.
   Kealey said the research also could lead to a more effective
depilatory for removing unwanted hair.
   Hairs grow for about two years and then spontaneously shed, he
said, adding that a natural depilatory would result if the shedding
process could be hastened.
   ``In fact, what we can do now in the laboratory is persuade
hairs to shed in this very natural manner and so we hope that we
might quite quickly start trying to work on improved
depilatories,'' Kealey said.
   Cambridge University is known for its contributions to
scientific research, including discovery of the electron, the
neutron and the structure of DNA, the building blocks of genetic
material.
   Kealey said that although he was ``thrilled'' at the team's
breakthrough, as an intellectual achievement ``it has to be viewed
as rather trivial.''
   Nevertheless, many men will find the breakthrough welcome news
since, Kealey said, the onset of balding can be ``intensely
traumatic - maybe because it is the first visible sign of advancing
age.''
   ``I am myself bald, but I don't think it's something that
bothers me very much,'' he added.

   Not all the pumpkins decorating homes
this fall were scooped out and carved into jack-o'-lanterns. Some
are 5 feet high, 4{ feet wide and stuffed with leaves.
   Giant Stuff-A-Pumpkins, 260-gallon plastic leaf bags with black
pumpkin faces, are the rage this Halloween season, ornamenting
millions of lawns across America.
   ``We don't have any trees in our yard, so we went out one night
and robbed the leaves of the people next door,'' said Betty Brown,
a West Hartford mother of three whose family of Stuff-A-Pumpkins
peer down from her front-porch roof.
   ``It was fun filling them,'' said her 11-year-old daughter,
Jennifer. ``Kids on the bus see them on the roof and they ask me,
`Where'd you get em?'''
   The bags are made by Stamford-based Sun Hill Industries Inc.
   Sun Hill gave the world those tiny, stick-on digital clocks,
plastic banana ears and Cool Sounds, a beach cooler with a radio
built into the lid, along with mostly seasonal novelties like
floating ghosts, pumpkin lampshade-covers and Easter egg decorating
kits.
   The Giant Stuff-A-Pumpkin is its biggest seller ever, said
Benson Zinbarg, president of the company.
   ``It's a self-advertising product,'' he said. ``When people see
it on their neighbor's lawn, they want to have it in their yard.''
   One of Sun Hill's executives dreamed up the idea in late 1988,
during one of its brainstorming sessions.
   Zinbarg couldn't get bank financing to develop and market the
pumpkin bags. He ended up gambling all his savings and persuading
friends to invest.
   The bags were in stores last fall, but didn't take off until
this year. They are now sold in nearly every major retail chain,
said Zinbarg, a former plastics engineer.
   Zinbarg wouldn't disclose sales figures for his privately held
company, but said he will be able to pay off his creditors by next
month thanks to the Stuff-A-Pumpkin. His employees can except a
nice bonus, too, he said.
   Susan Feinberg, a spokeswoman for K mart Corp. in Troy, Mich.,
said the chain ran out of the bags within a couple of weeks at its
2,100 stores nationwide.
   The Giant Stuff-A-Pumpkin sells for $3.98 retail, but can be
found for as little as $1.98 in some discount stores.
   Sun Hill recently added ``Pumpkin Patch'' bags, in papa, mamma
and baby sizes of 32 gallons, 21 gallons and 11{ gallons. Then
there's the Stuff-a-Bat, Stuff-a-Cat and Stuff-a-Witch. But the
Giant Stuff-A-Pumpkin is the blockbuster, Zinbarg said.
   Stamford-based Sun Hill obtained a patent for its
Stuff-A-Pumpkins in August. A few imitations have cropped up, but
five manufacturers have agreed to stop producing the phonies,
Zinbarg.

   Mayor Marion Barry was sentenced today to six
months in prison, fined $5,000 and given one year probation for his
conviction on a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge.
   Barry declared himself ``truly remorseful'' and asked U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson for leniency. But Jackson
told the mayor he had abused his office and the collective trust of
the community.
   ``Having failed as the good example he might have been, the
defendant must now become an example of another kind,'' Jackson
said.
   The sentencing ended a 10-month legal drama that began with the
mayor's arrest Jan. 18 in an FBI sting operation that caught him on
videotape smoking crack cocaine with a former girlfriend. The night
before sentencing Barry, in a letter to the judge, said he wasa
``recovering alcoholic and drug addict.''
   ``I stand here truly remorseful and ask this court to impose
community service as a sentence,'' Barry told Jackson at today's
hearing.
   Barry said he was willing to ``take full and personal
responsibility for all my actions, all my attitudes.''
   But Jackson said Barry's position as mayor and ``his breach of
public trust alone warrants an enhanced sentence.'' The judge also
said:
   ``The public rumors of defendant's frequent and conspicuous drug
use - never dispelled and now unfortunately shown to have been true
- has given aid, comfort and encouragement to the drug culture at
large and contributed to the anguish that illegal drugs have
inflicted on this city in so many ways for so long.''
   Jackson also said he found evidence from the trial that Barry
had obstructed justice. However, the judge gave some weight to
Barry's admission that he was an alcoholic and a cocaine user.
   In issuing the sentence, Jackson forged a middle ground between
the recommendations of prosecutors who urged that Barry be given
the maximum one-year sentence and the defense.
   Jackson also ordered Barry to join a drug rehabilitation program
while in prison and said the mayor will be subject to random drug
testing during his year of probation.
   The mayor, whose term expires in January, is currently running
for city council. The sentence does not affect his position as
mayor or his candidacy.
   Barry ducked reporters waiting for him outside the U.S.
Courthouse and left by a side entrance, but his attorney, R.
Kenneth Mundy, said he planned to appeal the conviction and the
sentence, saying ``The final chapter has not been written.''
   The mayor, asked later about his sentence, said, ``I should have
been shocked and stunned, but I'm not. I understand that there are
different sets of standards for different people, and that's the
American injustice system.''
   Asked whether he should continue his bid for a city-wide council
seat, Barry responded, ``Absolutely. Why not?''
   Mundy said he and the mayor were disappointed by the sentence.
The defense attorney said prosecutors had made Barry ``a whipping
boy for all the ills that beset the District of Columbia.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said he would comment later in the
day.
   Barry was convicted on Aug. 10 of a single cocaine possession
charge and acquitted on another after a dramatic 10-week trial. The
jury deadlocked on the remaining 12 counts, and prosecutors said
they would not seek a new trial.
   The judge made clear that he disagreed with the jury's failure
to convict the mayor of the other charges. Jackson said he would
ignore ``what I perceive to have been the defendant's efforts ...
to induce the jury to disregard the law and the evidence.''
   ``The jurors will have to answer to themselves and to their
fellow citizens for the way in which they discharged their duty,''
he said in a stinging criticism of the panel.
   Barry's place of confinement has not yet been determined and
will be assigned by the federal Bureau of Prisons.
   In a 19-page pre-sentencing memorandum, Stephens said Barry has
shown a ``flagrant disregard for the law and seriously impugned the
integrity'' of his office.
   ``In short, the defendant is not genuinely remorseful about his
criminality,'' the memo said. ``He is sorry only that he got
caught.''
   Stephens said Barry, in his pre-sentencing interview with chief
deputy U.S. probation officer Arthur Carrington, admitted to ``two
dozen unspecified cocaine possessions.''
   The prosecutor wrote that Barry had a ``brazen disregard for the
law'' which ``conveyed a particularly devastating message to a
number of people,'' iccluding the city's youth and law enforcement
officers who were struggling to bring drug-driven crime in the
capital under control.
   The mayor, who underwent substance abuse treatment at two
clinics following his arrest, has acknowledged abusing alcohol and
prescription drugs. But he had never previously admitted using
illegal street drugs, although his lawyer had called him an
``occasional'' user.
   Prosecutors built their case against Barry on the testimony of
former girlfriends, friends, allies from the civil rights movement
and city employees who testified that they had used drugs with the
mayor and supplied drugs to him.

   The daughter of U.S. Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was
sentenced to three years' probation in a drug-related case.
   Gayle Rosten, 33, originally was charged with possession of
cocaine with intent to deliver, a crime that would have mandated a
prison sentence had she been convicted. But last month she pleaded
guilty to a reduced drug charge.
   Judge Harry Hartel on Thursday also ordered Rosten to perform
200 hours of public service, pay a fine of $2,800 and forfeit the
1988 car in which an ounce of cocaine was found when she was
arrested.
   Rosten has been attending a drug treatment program since June 5,
according to her attorney James Reilley.
   She has no criminal record, but has been a heavy drug user, said
Robert Will, her Waukegan attorney.
   Rostenkowski, D-Ill., is a major power behind the nation's tax
laws.

   Delegates from 22 countries puffing on
pipes, cigars and cigarettes urged the United Nations on Friday to
allow smoking in the name of human rights.
   ``Smoking is a human right and should be respected according to
the Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations,'' said a
declaration adopted on the opening day of Smokepeace 90, the first
international smokers' conference.
   The 123 delegates came from Europe, South America, the United
States, Japan and Australia to the two-day meeting. They said they
represented 1.7 billion smokers worldwide.
   The meeting was sponsored by Finnish hotels and restaurants as
well as large multinational tobacco corporations including Philip
Morris and Rothmans.
   ``We are not puffing into the faces of nonsmokers. We are just
fighting back and want them to be aware of our feelings, as we are
of theirs,'' said Steve Handman, a spokesman for the American
Smokers Alliance.
   ``It seems to be a last-ditch effort by the smokers, but I think
to have this many people is amazing. Obviously, there's a little
lashback here,'' said Maureen Gail Mulvaney, a conference speaker
from the United States.
   Other delegates, including nonsmokers, maintained they were
attending the conference to fight for civil rights.
   ``What the whole world is facing is a barrage of intolerance
and, indeed, the outright infringement on personal liberty,'' said
Chris Tame, British director of the Freedom Organization For The
Right To Enjoy Smoking Tobacco.
   ``I don't smoke, but the threat to the freedom of smokers is a
threat to the freedom of all of us. Smokers now, drinkers next,''
Tame said.
   Finland has banned smoking in most public places and is among
countries with the strictest anti-smoking laws. However, delegates
soon filled the conference room in Finlandia Hall with smoke.
   Aarne Saarinen, a former leader of the Finnish Communist Party,
said the conference venue had been carefully chosen.
   ``It was here after all that the Helsinki Human Rights Accords
were signed in 1975 ... where the process of international detente
got off to a good start,'' said Saarinen, who was the official host
of the conference.
   ``What we want is detente between smokers and nonsmokers,''
Saarinen said.
   ``Recently, anti-smokers have had seven international
conferences. This is the first occasion that those who want to
disagree with them can speak out,'' said Bob Browning, a
businessman from Australia.
   Browning said he had been a heavy smoker but had quit for health
reasons.
   ``I have taught my kids not to smoke. But banning smoking is not
the answer. You have to listen to the other side too,'' Browning
said.

   A free-lance photographer who says he was
``roughed up'' after John Goodman's wedding in New Orleans last
year is suing the actor, three police officers and the city.
   Russell Turiak of New York, in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday,
said he was accosted by policemen when he tried to take pictures of
the Goodmans as they left their wedding reception aboard the river
boat Creole Queen.
   Goodman, 37, married Annabeth Hartzog, a former University of
New Orleans student and model.
   The photographer claims an officer grabbed him in a choke hold
and removed the film from his camera after threatening to kill him
if he didn't give it up.
   Losing the film cost Turiak money and damaged his professional
reputation with the unnamed publications to which he promised
photos, the suit said.
   Turiak seeks unspecified damages.
   Goodman, who plays Roseanne Barr's husband on the television
show ``Roseanne,'' appeared in ``The Big Easy'' and ``Everybody's
All-American,'' both filmed in the New Orleans area.
   He is scheduled to appear as Santa Claus in a New Orleans
Christmas parade in December.
   Goodman's publicist, Stan Rosenfield, would not comment on the
lawsuit, except to say, ``To my knowledge Mr. Goodman has not been
served.''

   LONDON (AP) - Prince Charles says developers need to check with
environmental groups before beginning projects that could destroy
Britain's wildlife habitats.
   The heir to the British throne made the statement Thursday in a
videotaped message played at a news conference. It accompanied the
release of a report by the Royal Society for Nature Conservation.
   Nearly 700 sites of special scientific interest were lost or
damaged between 1984 and 1988, the prince said, quoting government
figures.
   Road-building plans in southeast Britain could damage more than
370 other sites, he said.
   ``One pond drained, one new road through one small corner of an
ancient woodland, might not in itself be a disaster, but the
destruction of a whole network of sites, by a whole catalogue of
changes, can destroy the viability of entire communities of
wildlife,'' he said.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos on Friday
announced $2.4 million in grants to help state and local education
agencies address the needs of homeless elementary and high school
students.
   Seventeen agencies in 14 states will receive grants ranging from
$64,414 to $265,000 under the Homeless Children and Youth Exemplary
Grant Program. Programs range from Project HOPE, Homeless Outreach
Program for Education, which focuses on children in mobile units in
Costa Mesa, Calif., to a school-based tutoring network in Quincy,
Mass.
   Describing the children as living ``in the most dire
circumstances,'' Cavazos said, ``These outstanding programs are
evidence that communities can provide for the needs of all children
including those temporarily without a home.''
   The Education Department estimates there were 272,773 homeless
students from kindergarten through high school age in 1988-89. In
the states that reported, about 72 percent of the students actually
attended school. About eight states did not report homeless
statistics, officials said.
   About 49 percent of the students were in elementary school, 21
percent in junior high school and 26 percent in high school. About
4 percent were not classified.
   Problems facing homeless children include ragged clothes, no
place to study and poor self-esteem.
   A report the department submitted to Congress in March showed
that 125,000 children lived in private shelters, 61,682 lived with
friends or relatives and 36,000 stayed in public shelters. About
58,000 listed ``other,'' with no explanation.
   Cavazos said the grants may be used to support efforts to
improve educational assessment, screening and placement of homeless
children and youth; to provide counselors, social workers and
health care; to increase sensitivity and awareness of school
personnel to the problems of homelessness; to increase parental
involvement; to assure an appropriate place to study after school;
and to provide adequate transportation.
   Programs receiving grants were:
   -Orange County Department of Education, Costa Mesa, Calif.,
$170,793.
   -Iowa Department of Education, Des Moines, $128,922.
   -Kansas State Department of Education, Topeka, $171,803.
   -Maryland State Department of Education, Baltimore, $44,140.
   -Massachusetts Depatment of Education, Quincy, $168,605.
   -City of Detroit Board of Education, $64,414.
   -Minneapolis Public Schools, $83,768.
   -Community School District 2, New York City, $170,564.
   -BOCES Southern Westchester, Tarrytown, N.Y., $135,608.
   -New York City Board of Education, $123,557.
   -North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, Bismarck,
$78,000.
   -Oklahoma City Public Schools, $197,862.
   -School District 1, Portland, Ore., $149,577.
   -Salem-Kizer School District 24J, Salem, Ore., $88,196.
   -Pennsylvania Department of Education, Philadelphia, $265,000.
   -Seattle Public School District, $249,548.
   -Madison Metropolitan School District, Wis., $71,750.

   The USS Iowa, which survived two wars and a
fiery explosion, was decommissioned Friday, with relatives of some
of the 47 crewmen killed in the 1989 blast among those on board.
   ``I was on her when they commmissioned her and I wanted to be on
when they decommissioned her,'' said Bob Smith, 65, a retired truck
driver from Webster, Mass., who served aboard the battleship in
World War II.
   ``It's hard to see her go into mothballs. I'll start counting
the days until she comes out again,'' said Dr. Jack B. Martin, one
of several former crewmen who predicted the Iowa would return to
service someday.
   ``This world isn't at peace yet,'' said Martin, 70, a World War
II veteran who is an optometrist in Clarinda, Iowa.
   Adm. Jerome L. Johnson, vice chief of naval operations, agreed
that the battleship may be called back to active duty.
   ``If we need her again, she will be there,'' Johnson said at the
ceremony.
   Strong winds and rain pushed the decommissioning ceremony from a
pier at the Norfolk Naval Base to aboard ship. While the ceremony
took place on the ship's bridge, current and former crewmen and
their family members milled around the rain-soaked wooden decks or
drank coffee in the mess hall.
   Among those on board were several relatives of the 47 crewmen
killed during the April 19, 1989, gun turret explosion.
   Paula Schwarz and Mary Messina of Levittown, N.Y., wearing
sweatshirts that read ``Remember the Iowa 47,'' said they came to
honor their brother, Peter Bopp, who died in the blast two days
before his 22nd birthday.
   ``He loved the ship. He would have been here,'' Ms. Messina
said.
   The ship's chaplain, Cmdr. Joseph C. Cappar, said the Iowa's
living and dead crewmen should be remembered for their role in
preserving democracy.
   ``Although we bid farewell to the teak decks and steel plates,
we do not say goodbye to Iowa for Iowa is us,'' Cappar said in the
ceremony.
   The ship will be moved to the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in
neighboring Portsmouth for decommissioning work before it goes into
mothballs at the Philadelphia Naval Yard next year.
   Shortly after the ship was commissioned in 1943, it carried
President Franklin Roosevelt to a war conference. For the trip, the
ship was outfitted with a bathtub and to this day remains the only
Navy ship with a bathtub.
   After protecting aircraft carriers during Pacific battles, the
Iowa was decommissioned in 1949. Two years later, it was returned
to service for the Korean War.
   The ship was back in mothballs from 1958 to 1984, when it was
recommissioned as part of the Navy buildup to a 600-ship fleet. The
Navy continued to use the ship's 16-inch guns, which could fire at
targets as far away as 20 miles, and added cruise missiles.
   After the April 1989 explosion off Puerto Rico, the ship
returned to sea within two months with the damaged gun turret
sealed. Officials estimated repairs would cost $13 million, which
led to the decision to mothball the ship as part of efforts to cut
the federal budget deficit.
   Navy investigators said a disgruntled gunner's mate sabotaged
the guns, but questions about the findings from the victims'
families and members of Congress led to a new probe that should be
completed in a few months.
   The battleship USS New Jersy will be decommisioned in February,
leaving the Navy with two battleships, the USS Wisconsin and the
USS Missouri.

<HEAD>War Resumes Between Colombian Cocaine Cartels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colombia's two main cocaine cartels have
resumed their bloody war with a series of tit-for-tat kidnappings
and murders, police said Friday.
   Twelve men were kidnapped Thursday from a slum hotel in
Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city, and within hours two were
found murdered and a third was wounded, according to a national
police report.
   All the men were residents of Cali, home base to a cocaine
cartel that competes with the Medellin clan for access to the
lucrative U.S. drug market.
   Police said the two murdered men had long criminal records. They
were apparently in Medellin to take revenge for the murders last
month of 19 people killed by members of the Medellin cartel in the
outskirts of Cali, the police said.
   Also Thursday, two men and a woman were found murdered at a
private house in the capital of Bogota, the police report said.
Their bodies were discovered bound and gagged.
   Red paint sprayed on the walls read: ``Death to those of the
Medellin cartel.'' Security forces found a car packed with about 70
pounds of dynamite police said was apparently for use in terrorist
attacks in the capital.
   The report added that Bogota police on Thursday also arrested
three men suspected of carrying out terror attacks for the Medellin
cartel. The suspects possessed blueprints of an army recruiting
building where they apparently were planning an attack, the report
said.
   On Friday, security forces shot dead nine people allegedly
responsible for a kidnapping 23 days earlier. The three abducted
people were freed during the operation in a small town about 45
miles south of Bogota, Bogota police commander Yazim Yanine said.
   He said police had not determined if the kidnappings were linked
to drug traffickers.
   So far this year, 950 people have been kidnapped in Colombia,
according to official figures. Drug traffickers, leftist guerrillas
and common criminals seeking ransom money are most often
responsible.
   The Medellin and Cali cartels have been fighting each other for
two years to gain control of the multimillion-dollar U.S. cocaine
markets.
   Authorities say the Medellin cartel, the main target of a
government anti-drug crackdown, has lost ground to the Cali gang in
recent months.
   The Medellin cartel has been blamed for killing about 550
Colombians, including three presidential candidates, since the
government and the cartel declared war on each other in August
1989.
   The Medellin mafia's most recent offenses were the kidnappings
two months ago of seven journalists, including the daughter of a
former president and the news editor of the country's leading
newspaper, El Tiempo.
   The journalists and Marina Montoya, sister of Colombia's
ambassador to Canada, are still in captivity. Drug traffickers are
apparently trying to force the government into granting them a
pardon.
   In a related develpment, Antonio Navarro, the first ex-guerrilla
to hold a Cabinet position, resigned as health minister Friday to
run for a seat in Colombia's national assembly, which will reform
the country's 104-year-old constitution.
   Navarro was appointed in August, months after his M-19 leftist
guerrilla group signed a peace treaty with the government. Recent
public opinion polls indicate that Navarro would be a shoe-in for
one of 70 seats in an upcoming constitutional assembly.

   House and Senate negotiators agreed early
Friday to give President Bush the debt relief he seeks for Egypt
but at the same time defied the president in slashing aid to El
Salvador.
   After an all-night and often stormy marathon bargaining session,
the two sides set up a difficult choice for the president: whether
to swallow an unwanted 50 percent cut in El Salvador military aid
to win forgiveness of Egypt's $6.7 billion in past military debt.
   Both new provisions are part of a $15.5 billion foreign aid bill
for the year that began Oct. 1, which includes economic and
military support for America's friends and allies around the globe.
   Bargainers faced with a likely weekend adjournment of Congress
began Thursday and worked all night to come up with a compromise
package that could be sent to the full House and Senate in time to
get the bill enacted.
   Bush's senior advisers have threatened a veto over the El
Salvador provisions, which are a departure from nearly 10 years of
U.S. policy begun during the Reagan administration.
   But the erasure of Egypt's debt, intended as a reward for
Cairo's leadership of the Arab response in the Persian Gulf crisis,
is a powerful incentive for Bush to accept the package.
   ``The entire U.S. and world position against (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein and Iraq will be at risk'' if the debt is not
forgiven as Bush promised, said Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., the
senior GOP member of the Senate Appropriations foreign aid
subcommittee.
   And subcommittee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said the gesture
was nothing less than a test of American resolve. ``I don't want a
war to start in the Middle East because people questioned the
commitment of the United States,'' he argued.
   But House subcommittee Chairman David Obey, D-Wis., countered
that he would have difficulty winning votes for the bill in the
House if it fully forgives Egypt's debt. Members facing elections
just two weeks away will find it hard to support such a gesture
while voting for higher taxes for their constituents, he said.
   And Obey complained heatedly that Bush made the promise to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak without consulting lawmakers
first. ``The Congress got sandbagged on this issue,'' he said.
   The El Salvador provision calls for an immediate 50 percent cut
in this year's $85 million in military aid as a step toward
creating incentives for the San Salvador government and the leftist
FMLN rebels to end their decade-long civil war with a negotiated
political settlement.
   If the rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
walk away from U.N.-sponsored peace talks, the aid could be
restored. But if the government fails to pursue peace, it could
lose the other half of its military aid.
   The arrangement represents a major change in U.S. policy toward
El Salvador, which has received aid at a rate of nearly $1 million
a day in recent years. It also was a victory for congressional
opponents of administration policy, who are weary of 10 years of
aid which has done little to encourage moderation in the Central
American country.
   In other provisions, the bill pointedly omits any specific
earmark for Pakistan, which in past years has been the
third-largest recipient of U.S. aid. In fact, it erects new hurdles
before aid can be ranted, including certification that this week's
elections were free and fair and restoration of full civil
liberties.
   Israel is the top beneficiary of the bill with some $3 billion
in cash military and economic aid, and millions more in non-cash
benefits. The conferees agreed to include a section that would let
the United States give Israel up to $700 million worth of new
weaponry from Pentagon stocks.
   In addition to the debt forgiveness, Egypt is the second-largest
cash aid recipient, with $2.1 billion. The money for the two Middle
Eastern countries stems from their Camp David peace accord and
their status as staunch U.S. allies in the region.
   The bill provides a total of $3.1 billion for economic aid and
$4.6 billion for military aid. The remaining funds go for other
programs, including health and environmental assistance and
contributions to the World Bank and other multilateral
institutions.
   Congress is giving the administration more latitude than usual
to decide how to distribute the money.
   But lawmakers did include specific earmarks for several favored
countries: Jordan, $35 million in economic aid; Morocco, $20
million in economic and $43 million in military aid; Greece, $350
million in military aid; Turkey, $500 million in military aid; and
$62.5 million in economic aid for Peru, Bolivia and Colombia.
   The bill also includes $800 million for sub-Saharan Africa, $7.5
million for Lebanon, $20 million for Ireland, $364 million for
Eastern Europe and up to $20 million for humanitarian and
development aid in Cambodia.
   The Philippines would get $160 million for this year's payment
on a five-year, $1 billion aid program called the Multilateral
Assistance Initiative. That is $40 million less than the
administration had asked, and the same as last year's amount.

<HEAD>Town Council Quits in Huff Over Mafia Accusation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALMA DI MONTECHIARO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Town Council has
resigned to protest reports its members are suspected of ties with
the Mafia.
   The councilmen followed the lead of the mayor, Paolo Scarna.
   He quit after a nephew was suspected of killing a judge last
month who was ruling on whether purported Mafia members should be
kept under house arrest, news reports said Friday.
   The resignations of the 32 council members came amid reports
that police were investigating local politicians for possible links
with organized crime.
   The town of 25,000 people, one of the poorest in Sicily, is in
the province of Agrigento, an area that over the last few years has
seen many slayings linked to the mob, including the murder of two
anti-Mafia magistrates.
   Italy's top anti-Mafia fighter, Magistrate Domenico Sica, has
looked into possible Mafia activity in the town.
   In Palermo, meanwhile, officials announced on Friday that police
have arrested 12 people suspected of drug-trafficking and
money-laundering.
   The arrests came in a nationwide sweep that began Thursday night
and involved searches of houses and business offices in Palermo,
Rome, Milan and the northern cities of Como and Asti, police
officials said.
   Those arrested were held for investigation of suspected
organized crime ties that involved drug dealing and money
laundering.
   Investigators said they were aided by the testimony of a former
mobster-turned-informer and by the discovery in January of a ledger
that police say contained entries on Mafia financial transactions.
The ledger was found in the house of a fugitive suspected Mafia
boss.
   The drugs appeared to have moved directly from Turkey to Sicily
and the drug profits appeared to have been laundered through Swiss
banks, the Italian news agency AGI reported.

   Officials relented and allowed the removal of fig
leaves covering three nude figurines displayed at City Hall after
the artist accused the city of censorship.
   Assistant City Manager Levi Davis and city park officials on
Monday ordered the ``Getting Better Ain't Always Easy'' exhibit by
Lubbock artist Future Atkins covered.
   By Thursday, city officials had countermanded their decision.
   Dallas artist Chase Yarborough, who designed the makeshift
leaves, removed them Thursday. The figurines were then moved away
from a public entrance to a less conspicuous location in a corner
of the first-floor lobby.
   The officials said they wanted the 7{-inch statues clothed
because they thought the nudity might offend visitors.
   ``Now they can be seen as they were intended: unfigged,
uncensored,'' Atkins said.
   She said people who view the exhibit probably will be
disappointed.
   ``I think people who expect more risque stuff are going to be
disappointed,'' she said. ``They'll say, `This is what all the
trouble is about? That is all it is?' ''
   The three female figures are portrayed in yoga positions.
   Dallas assistant park director Yvonne Washington called Ms.
Atkins Wednesday to apologize for the episode.
   The artist said she accepted the apology and will allow city
officials to move the exhibit to the rear of the lobby.
   The Dallas Women's Caucus for Art sponsored the exhibit that
includes Ms. Atkins' figurines.
   onnie Wilber, president of the women's art group said the
unveiling is a victory.
   ``We do feel good about it,'' Wilber said. ``But we would feel
better about it if the issue had never come up.''

<HEAD>Israeli Report Says Palestinians Started Riot But Criticizes
Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Israeli report on the Temple Mount killings
exonerated police Friday for using live gunfire on rioting stone
throwers. But it severely criticized police commanders for ignoring
warning signs of potential riots.
   The report drew immediate criticism from Palestinians and
Israeli leftists and brought renewed demands for Israel to allow a
United Nations investigation into the deaths of 20 Palestinians in
the Oct. 8 bloodbath.
   The three-man Israeli investigative team said Palestinians
started the riots. Still, it accused police commanders of failing
to heed the danger that rioting could easily erupt in the heated
atmosphere among Moslems at the shrine. And it said there was
``indiscriminate use of live ammunition.''
   The panel, appointed by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
danger to policemen's lives justified the overall use of gunfire,
but also emphasized ``the immediate need to develop alternatives to
the use of live ammunition.''
   In the riots at the shrine in Jerusalem's walled Old City, more
than 140 people were wounded by gunshots in addition to those
killed, according to hospitals.
   Police intially listed 19 dead, but Friday's report increased
the toll to 20.
   The killings brought a hail of international criticism of
Israel. On Oct. 12, the U.N. Security Council condemned the use of
excessive force, and on Wednesday it delored Israel's refusal to
accept a U.N. investigation.
   Both resolutions were backed by the United States, Israel's
chief ally.
   Friday's 59-page report blamed the start of the rioting on
``violent and threatening'' calls through loudspeakers at the
Mount's two mosques, including an exhortation to ``slaughter the
Jews.''
   A barrage of rocks and metal objects was then unloosed at
policemen on the Mount, the report said.
   ``The commission has concluded tat the lives of the police on
the Temple Mount were endangered, and that they feared for their
lives and for the lives of thousands of worshipers at the Western
Wall,'' the report said.
   Stones hitting Jews caused an intensely emotional reaction since
the wall, also known at the Wailing Wall, is revered as the last
remnant of the ancient Jewish temple.
   Initial reports said the stoning began when as many as 20,000
Jews were at the wall for prayers during the eight-day festival of
Sukkot. But the report noted that the first stones were aimed at
police on the Mount above 55 minutes after the prayers ended, when
Jews began moving away.
   It listed nine Jews injured at the wall and 21 police hurt by
rocks during the 40 minutes before police issued a cease-fire
order.
   After tear gas and rubber bullets failed to halt the rioting,
police retreated from the mosque compound, the report said. It said
they began to use live ammunition as they charged back onto the
Mount.
   The live fire also was justified by pleas for rescue from two
police on the Mount, the report said. However, it later turned out
the men already had been rescued by Moslem officials.
   The use of uncontrolled fire by police was not mentioned until
the next-to-last page of the report.
   It said there was ``indiscriminate use of live ammunition,''
implying it came when lives were no longer in danger and the Temple
Mount area was under control.
   The report's strongest criticism was aimed at Jerusalem Police
Chief Aryeh Bibi and District Commander Rahamim Comfort, saying
they did not recognize the potential for rioting and were not even
present in the area.
   ``Police had prior reports of the possibility of riots on the
Temple Mount'' but the two commanders reacted with an attitude that
was ``routine and even mistaken,'' the report said.
   It added: ``We found virtually no attitude of special
sensitivity ... when masses of Jewish worshipers were in the
Western Wall plaza while at the same time, opposite on the Temple
Mount, thousands of impassioned youths were gathering.''
   The Temple Mount is also holy to Moslems, who call it the Haram
es-Sharif and believe it is the spot where Prophet Mohammed
ascended to heaven.
   The rioting erupted on a day when a group of extremist Jews had
announced a gathering to lay a cornerstone for the building of a
Third Jewish Temple atop the Moslem-controlled Mount.
   Although police blocked the march, the group's members were
allowed in the area, and rumors persisted among Moslems that the
zealots were going to assault the Mount.
   The commission did not recommend disciplinary action against
police officials, saying that was not part of its mandate. But
Police Minister Roni Milo told reporters that after he studied the
commission's findings ``the necessary conclusions will be drawn.''
   After the report was released, the liberal Shinui Party and the
Communists both urged the government again to allow a U.N. team to
probe the killings.
   Tzali Reshev of the Peace Now movement charged that the report
left many questions unanswered. Palestinians said it did not take
their side of the story into account.
   ``This was not a committee of investigation, but one formulating
the government of Israel's stand,'' said Faisal Husseini, the
leading PLO supporter in Jerusalem.

   Iraqi occupation forces have seized two
Americans who had been hiding in Kuwait to avoid capture, Western
diplomats disclosed Friday.
   Uwe Jahnke, 47, of Washington Depot, Conn., and John Stevenson,
44, of Panama City, Fla., were brought to Baghdad on Oct. 22, a day
after their arrest in Kuwait, said the diplomats, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   They said the pair was taken to the government-run Mansour-Melia
Hotel, where scores of other foreigners are being held.
   Baghdad has refused to allow thousands of foreigners trapped by
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait to leave. Foreign women and
children were eventually allowed to depart, and some men were
released at the intervention of officials from their governments.
   But hundreds of others, including more than 100 Americans, were
sent to strategic installations to deter a possible attack by
U.S.-led multinational forces that assembled in Saudi Arabia after
the invasion.
   Western diplomats were allowed access to the recently captured
Americans, they said.
   ``They're obviously upset at being held by the Iraqi authorities
but otherwise they're just fine,'' one diplomat said.
   The sources said Jahnke had worked with an investment company in
Kuwait and Stevenson was an employee of the Bank of Kuwait.
   Jahnke's wife, who refused to give her full name, said in a
telephone interview from her Connecticut home that the State
Department had told her of her husband's capture. She said he had
been in hiding in Kuwait since the Iraqi invasion.
   He worked as a banker for the Gulf Investment Corp. in Kuwait
and had lived in the emirate for the last 4{ years, she said.
   The two were seized by Iraqi soldiers at an apartment where they
had been hiding in Kuwait City, the diplomats said.
   ``They shifted together to the apartment from their homes to
evade being detected, but apparently they were turned in by some
informers,'' one diplomat said.
   They said they had no other details about the seizures.
   The two men were brought to Baghdad aboard a bus in a 19-hour
desert journey, the diplomats said.
   One diplomat said he feared Iraqi authorities would punish the
pair by sending them to be held at potential military targets.
   ``Our concern starts now,'' he said.

<HEAD>Soviet Coal Miners Union Could Become Second Largest Mass
Organization</HEAD>

   Hundreds of hopeful coal miners created
the Soviet Union's first nationwide independent trade union Friday,
unanimously accepting an ambitious plan to reduce government
control over their lives.
   The new Association of Independent Unions of Miners will act as
an umbrella organization for an unlimited number of local unions.
Membership could include 2 million miners and an unknown number of
students, engineers, rescue workers and others who work at the
country's 600 mines.
   It could become the country's largest mass organization outside
the 18 million-member Communist Party.
   The new confederation, created during the second nationwide
miners' congress in this industrial Ukrainian city, plans to use
national strikes to push its demands, which range from better
medical care and mining equipment to profit-sharing and higher
salaries.
   The 900 delegates to the congress put off calling any strikes
until the parliament of the Russian Federation, the largest Soviet
republic, finishes its special session in December.
   The union registered its first victory just hours after its
formation when a deputy minister of the coal industry agreed to
dispatch a special commission to investigate complaints about
unfair firings at several mines.
   However, the new union still faces several hurdles in
establishing itself.
   The Soviet coal industry and its official union administer
dozens of schools, hospitals, vacation resorts and housing
complexes, in addition to mines and mineral processing factories.
Miners have become accustomed to the state-provided services, and
the new union has yet to decide which of the tasks it can or should
try to take over.
   It was also unclear how many miners might join the new union or
remain loyal to the official one.
   ``We have created a new union, but the old one still exists,''
Konstantin Fesenko, a miner from Donetsk, told the congress. ``The
old and new unions at some point might negotiate to come together,
but the current apparatchiks must go first.''
   The delegates, many of whom fear for their jobs without
government guarantees and subsidies, were deadlocked for most of
the congress over whether and how to create an independent union.
   The impasse was broken when a group of 130 miners, fed up with
the delays, split Thursday night to form an independent union led
by radicals from the Kuznetsk Basin, a mining region in western
Siberia.
   On Friday morning, the congress voted by unanimous show of hands
to absorb the radicals' union into its new, much larger
confederation.
   Vyacheslav Golikov, leader of the radicals, drafted a charter
that became the basis of the new confederation. It calls for the
union to ``represent and defend miners' interests'' in negotiations
with the government, take actions based on a consensus of its
members, administer a strike fund and set up a bank for the miners.
   On Friday, the congress approved the charter and created a
20-member executive bureau to plan the union's first conference. No
date or location was set.
   Miners were told to return home to solicit members for the new
local unions that will, in turn, elect representatives to a union
legislature.
   The union will be funded by deductions from miners' monthly
wages, which average $673, about one-third more than the national
average.
   Delegates at the congress represented hundreds of workers'
committees that sprang up during a series of strikes across the
country in 1989. The biggest wave of strikes that summer threatened
nearly half the country's energy supplies and forced concessions
from the government, including promises to improve safety equipment
and supplies of consumer goods.
   However, the miners say many of the promises have not been kept.
At their first congress in June, they demanded the resignation of
the national Council of Ministers, or cabinet, led by Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   ``The central government has not fulfilled its promises,'' said
Alexander Sergeyev, a Kuznetsk miner. ``Now we demand financial and
material support from the government during the country's
`transition to a market economy.' The official union also must give
back dues to workers who are leaving to join our new union.''
   In a parallel congress in Moscow this week, the official Central
Council of Trade Unions voted to reconstitute itself as a voluntary
organization. Previously, all trade unions had been required to
belong to it.
   Organizers of the Donetsk congress denounced the central
council's move as a facade to hide continuing government control of
unions. A representative of the council told the congress Friday
that the council's leaders would meet soon to decide whether to
recognize the new union.

<HEAD>Panel Would Use Carrot and Stick to Deter Corporate Crime</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal commission on Friday proposed a
``carrot-and-stick'' approach to deter and punish corporate crime -
promising massive fines for unrepentant wrongdoers.
   The U.S. Sentencing Commission announced a complex set of
alternatives designed to assure that businesses operate within the
law.
   ``I am convinced that the guidelines the commission ultimately
adopts will motivate organizations who might otherwise commit
crimes to conform to acceptable standards of behavior,'' said
commission Chairman William W. Wilkins Jr., a federal appellate
judge.
   The proposals are ``premised on a carrot-and-stick approach that
provides incentives for organizations to establish meaningful
compliance programs that deter, detect and report criminal conduct
by their agents and employees,'' he said.
   The seven-member commission asked for public comment on the
guidelines, which could be amended before they are submitted to
Congress early next year.
   For example, in one set of alternatives the commission proposed
a range of fines from $5,000 to $165 million depending on the
severity of the offense.
   Businesses could lessen the fines by promptly and voluntarily
reporting the offense prior to a government investigation, by
adopting programs to prevent future abuses and by proving that the
company's management was not involved.
   Jail terms for individual offenders are not covered by the
proposals.
   The commission, formed in 1985, established sentencing
guidelines for individuals in 1987. The constitutionality of those
guidelines, covering all forms of criminal behavior, were upheld by
the Supreme Court and are unaffected by the proposed business code.
   An earlier commission draft on punishing corporations was
attacked at a public hearing in February. Business groups said they
were too tough; public interest representatives said they did not
go far enough.
   The seven-member panel then revised the draft.
   The new proposals, by offering incentives for compliance, are
designed to meet some of the business opposition without
excessively softening the penalties.
   Wilkins, in a speech Thursday, said the plan ``rewards the
organization for its positive actions taken to prevent and detect
criminal conduct ... but significantly punishes the organizatoon
that does not have its house in order. It rewards the good and
punishes the bad.''
   Other proposals by the commission would:
   -Require corporations to surrender all illegal gains in addition
to any fines.
   -Require they pay restitution to compensate victims.
   -Force out of business any enterprise created for criminal
purposes by seizing its assets.
   -Give judges power to impose extra penalties for businesses that
engage in particularly serious offenses such as threatening the
environment or national security.
   -Put businesses on court-supervised probation to assure future
compliance.

<HEAD>Downed, Shot Pilot Pleads No Contest to 364 Securities Charges</HEAD>

   Thomas Root, the lawyer who was found
with a gunshot wound following an airplane crash in the Atlantic,
pleaded no contest Friday to 364 counts of securities fraud,
conspiracy and related charges.
   Under a plea bargain, Root agreed to a 15-year prison sentence
and a $5,000 fine, which will not be imposed until January. He also
agreed to testify against others indicted in an alleged securities
scam.
   The state dismissed 91 other charges against Root.
   Root, who faced up to 1,812 years in prison if convicted of all
455 charges, called the agreement an ``offer so attractive to me
that I could not refuse it.''
   ``I continue to suspect that my name was included in the
indictment not because of my culpability but rather because my
notoriety from my ill-fated airplane flight in July 1989 ensured
the prosecution of getting plenty of press attention for the
indictments,'' he said.
   Root, 37, who is a Washington lawyer, passed out in the cockpit
of his single-engine plane during a flight from Washington to Rocky
Mount, N.C. The plane, which was shadowed by military planes,
eventually crashed in the ocean off the coast of Florida.
   Root was pulled from the ocean after the crash and rescuers
discovered he had been shot in the abdomen. Root has insisted that
a pistol he kept in the plane discharged during the crash, but
experts have questioned his explanation of the wound.
   ``Fifteen years is a pretty good sentence,'' said Secretary of
State Rufus Edmisten, whose office was investigating Root and
Sonrise Management Services at the time of Root's aerial odyssey.
``It indicates we're not going to tolerate securities fraud in this
state.''
   A Nash County grand jury in June returned 24 indictments
containing 2,695 counts against Root and other officials of Sonrise
Management and Telemedia Inc.
   Sonrise helped form partnerships to federal licenses for
low-power FM radio stations. Edmisten said only a handful of
Sonrise's 1,600 investors ever received a license.
   ``In all, 1,018 people in North Carolina contributed more than
$8 million to this organization,'' Edmisten said. ``Nationally,
more than $16 million was invested by people from 25 states.''
   Root's state prison sentence will run concurrently with any
federal sentence he receives. Root pleaded guilty to five federal
securities charges in June and is awaiting sentencing.

<TEXT>
   Spanish officials said Raisa Gorbachev let
it be known from the start she didn't want a special program when
her husband Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a three-day official visit to
Spain.
   So, when the Soviet president began his first round of talks
with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez after arrival Friday, Raisa
Maximovna changed into a black tweed suit and set out to see the
Spanish capital.
   Her arrival at Plaza de Espana, a square in the heart of
downtown Madrid best known for its monument to Don Quixote and as a
haven for homeless African refugees, startled pigeons and
passersby.
   A Spanish TV reporter rushed up to Mrs. Gorbachev, greeted her
in English and asked her whether she liked Miguel Cervantes, author
of the 16th century novel about the man from La Mancha.
   ``I know and I like both Don Quixote and Sancho Panza,'' Mrs.
Gorbachev replied in Russian.
   At the Plaza Mayor in oldtown Madrid, Mrs. Gorbachev stopped in
a tavern with a city official and drank a toast with red Rioja wine
to the Spanish and Soviet people. Onlookers applauded.
   During her one scheduled event of the day, Mrs. Gorbachev and
Queen Sofia visited the Prado Museum and the Cason del Buen Retiro
annex that houses Guernica, Pablo Picasso's monumental painting
against the horrors of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War.
   ``Guernica is the symbol of civil war, the worst thing that can
happen to a country,'' Mrs. Gorbachev said after pausing in front
of the painting that is protected from attack by a clear plastic
shield.
   The Soviet Union supported the Second Spanish Republic in its
ill-fated struggle against an army rebellion led by Gen. Francisco
Franco, who subsequently established a 36-year dictatorship.
   Fear of a civil war grips many Soviets today, as long-suppressed
ethnic groups pit their conflicting territorial and religious
claims against each other.
   Once outside, Mrs. Gorbachev joined her husband for a visit to
city hall and Parliament, where nine years ago rebellious Civil
Guards held deputies hostage for 18 hours in an attempt to topple
Spain's government.
   The Gorbachevs were to dine privately with King Juan Carlos and
Queen Sofia on Saturday night and leave Sunday for Barcelona,
Spain's second city.

<HEAD>Federal Deficit Will Still Hit Record $250 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even if Congress agrees on a massive
deficit-reduction plan, the nation's deficit is still expected to
hit a record $250 billion this year and the $3 trillion federal
debt will continue to swell.
   ``As usual, the public is being overpromised or the rhetoric is
such that it's misleading, that this is the deal that will do away
with the deficit once and for all,'' said Stan Collender, who
watches federal budget policy for the Price Waterhouse accounting
firm.
   Analysts said many Americans are probably unaware that the $250
billion deficit-reduction plan - which Congress and the Bush
administration spent months feuding over - will rein in deficit
spending but won't eliminate it.
   The White House estimates the deficit for the current fiscal
year, which began Oct. 1, will be $294 billion. The budget
legislation before Congress would trim that by roughly $40 billion,
so another $254 billion will get added to the nation's long-term
debt.
   The size of the deficit, which totalled $220.4 billion in the
fiscal year ending Sept. 30, could be even worse in fiscal 1991 if
the nation's struggling economy continues to sour.
   ``Next year, when the projection of the deficit is released,
there's going to be a continued amount of cynicism. The public's
probably going to say, `We went through all this, and the deficit
is still going to be $250 billion?''' Collender said.
   Still, the budget watchers stress the significance of the
deficit-reduction plan, noting it's the largest one-year reduction
ever.
   ``It's a bloody miracle they managed to keep it as big as they
have. It's a very significant achievement,'' Carol Cox, president
of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said of
Congress' $250 billion, five-year package of new taxes and spending
slashes.
   The impact of the deficit reduction plan is relative, Collender
said.
   ``Compared to what the deficit would be if you didn't do this,
it will make a significant dent. Compared to zero, it's pretty
big,'' he said.
   The deficit is the amount by which spending exceeds revenue in a
given year, while the national debt is the compilation of years of
deficits.
   The national debt reached its first trillion in 1981, and has
tripled since then as Reagan cut taxes at the same time a military
buildup was occurring. The inability to reduce the federal deficit
was considered the major economic failure of the Reagan
administration.
   The bill now going through Congress would cut the deficit $250
billion over the next five years by raising taxes and limiting
Medicare and other mandatory spending. Another $250 billion would
come principally from scaling back military spending and cutting
interest expenses by reducing government borrowing.
   The bill envisions that today's federal debt of $3 trillion-plus
will soar to $5 trillion by the end of the five-year period.
   The only way to make a bigger stab at the debt is to even out
spending with revenue income, analysts note.
   ``There's no magic to it. You cut spending or increase taxes,
which means you need a certain amount of political will that
doesn't exist right now,'' Collender said.

   The government of Moldavia clamped a state of
emergency on its southern region Friday, after the Gagauz ethnic
minority declared sovereignty from the republic and began holding
local elections.
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said the republic was ``on
the brink of civil war'' as volunteer brigades of college-age
Moldavians arrived in the disputed area to try to stop the
separatist movement.
   About 150,000 Gagauz, who are of Turkish descent, live in
Moldavia and make up about 3 percent of its 4.3 million people.
They claim 11 percent of its territory.
   The largely agricultural republic, which borders Romania, is the
latest of several Soviet republics to face separatist movements and
ethnic tension.
   The conflicts in Moldavia, Armenia, Georgia and elsewhere are
fragmenting the country and pose a serious obstacle to President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   On Thursday, the grain-growing republic of Kazakhstan declared
sovereignty, becoming the 14th of the 15 Soviet republics to assert
some form of autonomy from Moscow.
   As its first act of defiance, the Kazakh legislature banned
nuclear explosions anywhere on its territory, including
Semipalatinsk, one of the main Soviet sites for testing warheads.
   The only Soviet republic that has yet to declare sovereignty is
Kirgizia, a mountainous region of Central Asia. The Kirgiz
parliament has been debating the issue and is expected to issue a
declaration soon.
   Moldavian Parliament Speaker Alexander Moshanu appealed on
television Thursday night for ``maximum restraint, calm and
tolerance to prevent clashes between volunteers and the Gagauz
people.''
   Militants on both sides are ready to ``cast us into the abyss of
violence,'' Moshanu warned.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Moldavia's
parliament imposed the state of emergency after Gagauz leaders
refused to negotiate with Moldavian President Mirca Snegur.
   The parliament also voted to abolish local government bodies in
the region and replace them with committees appointed by the
republic, Tass said.
   Movement in and out of the region was restricted and public
rallies and other meetings banned for two months. The state of
emergency will be enforced by Soviet Interior Ministry troops under
the control of officials in the republic, Tass said.
   The Gagauz people, who are predominately Christian, fled to
Moldavia from Turkish Moslem rule in northeastern Bulgaria in the
early decades of the 19th century. They speak a Turkic language and
are traditionally farmers and shepherds.
   In recent years, they have complained of discrimination by the
Moldavian majority, objecting in particular to a law making
Moldavian the republic's official language and replacing the
Cyrillic alphabet with the Roman one.
   Police blocked roads leading to the Gagauz region on Friday
after columns of buses carrying volunteers in their late teens and
early 20s began arriving from central Moldavia, the independent
Interfax news agency said.
   Interfax quoted Moldavia's Interior Ministry as saying that
20,000 to 25,000 volunteers arrived in the south of the republic
``to prevent the further conducting of the elections.''
   The volunteer brigades were organized by the Moldavian People's
Front and other nationalist organizations.
   Auriel Sorokovich, a spokesman for the People's Front, said in a
telephone interview that as many as 50,000 unarmed volunteers were
headed to the region to help the militia in case of violence.
   ``Volunteers now serve as a psychological attack on the Gagauz
leaders to prevent them from inciting any undesirable
developments,'' he said.
   ``They will be used only after the militia decide that they
can't cope with the situation themselves. The volunteers are now
placed in the vicinity of the republic's key points. They are ready
to occupy buildings and capture documents if the need arises,'' he
added.
   Interfax said Gagauz independence activists were also organizing
volunteer units, and it quoted unidentified sources as saying that
Soviet paratroopers and military equipment were taking up positions
``to prevent likely interethnic clashes.''
   Tass said a dozen armored personnel carriers were sent to the
town of Chemishlia, 50 miles southwest of the Moldavian capital,
Kishinev. It said several thousand Moldavians were massing in the
town.
   The conflict was precipitated by the Gagauz elections, which
were to choose an autonomous government.
   Soviet republics and smaller regions like Gagauz have been
breaking away at an acclerating pace since March, when the Baltic
republic of Lithuania declared independence.
   In addition to being the first to seek autonomy, Lithuania has
gone further than any of the other republics or regions, asserting
full and immediate independence as a separate state.
   Most of the others have declared only a limited form of
sovereignty, usually defined as the right to overrule national laws
and control natural resources.
   Nevertheless, the moves toward autonomy could impede Gorbachev's
efforts to put an economic reform plan into effect throughout the
country, because some republics want to move further and faster
toward a market economy than others.

<HEAD>Government Checks Due for Indian Land Buy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARAGA, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Treasury said it will pay $1.6
million to Indians in Michigan's Upper Peninsula for land they gave
up more than 100 years ago.
   ``We've been waiting a long time. My grandparents and my parents
taught us about the Indian money,'' Myrtle Tolonen of the Keweenaw
Bay band of Chippewa Indians said Thursday.
  The checks will be paid to more than 2,070 members of the tribe,
said Art Staples, a tribal operations specialist with the federal
Bureau of Indian Affairs. The tribe's governing body received a
matching sum of money several years ago.
   The money compensates the tribe for a host of wrongs between
1850 and 1910 when the United States took land and timber from the
western Great Lakes region. Some Indians were underpaid for their
land and others were swindled out of their holdings, Staples said.
   Tribal Chairman Fred Dakota said the amount seems too small.
   ``We've gotten so little and given so much,'' he said.
   Staples said the checks will be written as soon as the federal
government finishes reviewing the names submitted by the tribe.
   All tribal members as of Oct. 17, 1983 - the date the
distribution plan was approved by Congress - are eligible for the
money, which will be divided evenly among them. Each check should
be about $770.
   It took the Keweenaw tribe seven years to compile the list of
names.
   Tolonen, the tribe's enrollment director, said her office in
Baraga has been swamped with inquiries from tribal members about
when the checks will arrive.
   ``The people are frustrated,'' she said. ``They were supposed to
have these done by Sept. 13.''
   The payment is one of many ordered by the U.S. Court of Claims,
Staples said. Several other Chippewa tribes in Wisconsin and
Minnesota already have received land claim payments.
   Ottawa and Chippewa tribes in Michigan's eastern Upper Peninsula
and western Lower Peninsula still are negotiating among themselves
how to split more than $10 million they were awarded in the 1970s.
   Staples said interest on that claim has swelled the amount to
almost $46 million.

   The Senate gave final congressional approval
Friday to the nation's first post-Cold War defense budget, a $268
billion package that embraces modest cuts in weapons systems geared
to the Soviet threat.
   By a vote of 80-17, the Senate adopted legislation that
represents a $14 billion reduction from spending in the last fiscal
year but is far less than the reduction Congress clamored for when
the Warsaw Pact was collapsing.
   ``This budget has as its primary goal to help protect our nation
against the threat that we face in a dangerous world,'' said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee cited the
Soviet Union's continued modernization of its strategic forces and
Iraq's conquest of Kuwait as the argument against drastic cuts in
military spending.
   An opponent of the legislation, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said
the budget fails to reflect ``the most startling political
developments in the Western World since the end of World War II.''
   ``Congress ... is no longer a new breed of budget-cutters but
Cold War warriors,'' Roth said.
   The legislation now goes to the White House, where Bush's
approval was anticipated. Shortly after the vote, the Senate
adopted the budget's companion authorization bill.
   The bills fail to terminate any weapons in the Pentagon's
arsenal and continue limited production of the B-2 bomber, the
stealth aircraft built to locate targets in the Soviet Union after
a nuclear war.
   Among the other provisions are:
   -A cut of $2 billion from Bush's budget request of $4.7 billion
for the proposed antimissile shield commonly called Star Wars.
   -A troop reduction of about 80,000 from the 2.1 million level of
active duty forces. The administration had suggested a cut of about
38,000.
   -The creation of a $680 million budget for land-based nuclear
missiles. Bush proposed $2.2 billion for the MX missile and a plan
to move them from fixed silos to railroad cars and $202 million for
development of the Midgetman missile.
   Although the package won quick House approval Thursday - debate
and final passage took just 11 minutes - the budget for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1 touched off fierce disagreement on the
Senate floor.
   ``We must continue to press for defense spending reduction at
least down to the pre-Reagan, Cold War average,'' said Sen. Tim
Wirth, D-Colo. and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Wirth charged that the bill fails to reflect the lessening
Soviet threat. Specifically, it includes Bush's full request of
$118 million for the SRAM-T, a nuclear weapon designed to be fired
from aircraft stationed at NATO bases in Europe.
   ``Has the world changed? My lord it certainly has. The Berlin
Wall is down, the Warsaw Pact doesn't exist anymore. The Soviet
Union is falling apart,'' Wirth said. ``Here we are building Cold
War systems ... It makes no sense whatsoever.''
   The ranking members of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
defense argued that deep reductions would leave the military in a
precarious state and call into question the U.S. commitment to its
volunteer force.
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who lost his arm in World War II,
recalled how after the conflict then-President Truman submitted an
$11 billion defense budget hat Congress cut in half.
   ``Somehow it sent a signal to governments around the world. The
rest is history,'' Inouye said, referring to the Korean War.
   The legislation also doubles the call-up period for combat
reserves from 180 days to 360 days. Lawmakers have urged the use of
combat reserves in the military buildup in the Persian Gulf.

<HEAD>Californian Gives $10 Million to Small Liberal Arts School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POINT LOOKOUT, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 79-year-old physician will leave the
bulk of his estate - $10 million - to the College of the Ozarks to
inspire others to give the small school money, officials said.
   ``It's a very unusual story,'' college President Jerry C. Davis
said.
   The California man, whose identity was not made public by the
liberal arts school, took an interest in the college after reading
about it in the Wall Street Journal in 1973, Davis said Thursday.
   After visiting the school, nestled in scenic Ozarks hills, the
doctor decided to make the donation after his death to get others
to give money, Davis said.
   ``That article was the only contact he had with the school,''
Davis said. ``In fact, he had never been here until about a year
ago.''
   The $10 million will be used to endow a School of Natural
Sciences, professorships and scholarships and to construct a new
classroom-office building to be named after the man.
   ``It is my hope that this commitment will enable you to start
your campaign to raise substantial sums of money,'' the man wrote
in a letter to Davis. ``I want to challenge others to help
strengthen and prepare the college for the future.''
   Davis said the college's emphasis on work experience contributed
to the man's decision.
   The college has an enrollment of about 1,400, including 1,200
full-time students. All the full-time students work at one of 65
campus jobs or industries to pay for part of their education. The
remaining portion is provided through scholarships, gifts and
donations.
   College of the Ozarks, formerly School of the Ozarks, was
founded in 1906 to educate students who were financially unable to
enter other schools.
   The school has been ranked in U.S. News and World Report
magazine as one of the top 10 liberal arts schools in the Midwest
for the past two years and the ``best buy'' college in the region.

   Mayor Marion Barry drew a six-month prison
term Friday for cocaine possession from a judge who said Barry's
drug use had given ``aid, comfort and encouragement'' to the
illegal drug culture. Barry said the sentence came from ``the
American injustice system.''
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could have merely
sentenced the mayor to probation but said Barry's ``breach of
public trust alone warrants an enhanced sentence.''
   The judge stayed the sentence, which also includes a $5,000
fine, pending an appeal, which defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy
formally filed later in the day.
   Pleading for leniency before the sentence, the mayor said he had
``led an exemplary life'' since his arrest last January in a
downtown hotel. Barry had been lured there by former girlfriend
Rasheeda Moore and was videotaped smoking crack cocaine by FBI
agents operating concealed cameras.
   After the sentencing, Barry said, ``I should have been shocked
and stunned, but I'm not. I understand that there are different
sets of standards for different people, and that's the American
injustice system.''
   Mundy, who argued during the trial that Barry had been singled
out for prosecution because he is a well-known black official, said
after the sentencing that the judge had made the mayor ``a whipping
boy for all the ills that beset the District of Columbia.''
   In addition to his biting criticism of Barry, the judge also had
harsh words for the jury, which acquitted Barry of another
misdemeanor drug possession charge and deadlocked on 12 other
counts - nine misdemeanors and three felony perjury charges.
   ``The jurors will have to answer to themselves and to their
fellow citizens for the way in which they discharged their duty,''
Jackson said.
   The judge recommended that federal prison authorities place
Barry in a drug treatment program.
   Barry, who is running for City Council after declining to seek
election to a fourth term as mayor, was also ordered to serve a
year of probation following his release from prison. During that
time, Jackson said the mayor would be required to submit to random
drug tests.
   The misdemeanor conviction and sentence does not disqualify
Barry from holding or seeking public office.
   Barry was also ordered to reimburse the federal government for
the cost of his incarceration. The mayor's imprisonment would cost
$5,167 if, as is likely, he is sent to a minimum-security prison,
according to Bureau of Prison figures.
   ``The prevalence of the public rumors of defendant's frequent
and conspicuous drug use - never dispelled, and now unfortunately
shown to have been true - has given aid, comfort and encouragement
to the drug culture at large,'' Jackson said.
   Barry's drug use ``contributed to the anguish that illegal drugs
have inflicted on this city in so many ways for so long,'' Jackson
said.
   ``Having failed as the good example he might have been to the
citizens of Washington, D.C., and, in particular, to the young who
are much more likely to respond to example than to admonition, the
defendant must now become an example of another kind,'' the judge
said.
   The judge said that he would ignore ``what I perceive to have
been the defendant's efforts, once prosecution had commenced, to
induce the jury to disregard the law and the evidence.''
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens told reporters he was satisfied
with what he called a fair sentence even though prosecutors had
sought a one-year prison term. Barry's drug use ``contributed to
this city's and our nation's most devastating problem,'' Stephens
said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that
Barry's sentence ``brings this case to a just conclusion and sends
a clear and continuing message that the use of illegal drugs will
not be tolerated in our society.''
   But Mundy, the mayor's lawyer, said outside the U.S. Courthouse,
that ``the final chapter has not been written.''
   ``There were people in the District of Columbia who were using
drugs before the mayor used drugs and there will be people who will
keep using drugs after the mayor stops using drugs,'' he said.
   Mundy also said that others convicted of ``far more serious
offenses'' had been given probation in the same courthouse. The
lawyer cited former White House aide Michael K. Deaver, whom
Jackson placed on probation for lying under oath about his lobbying
activities.
   In court, Barry, who was accompanied by his wife, Effi, and his
mother, told Jackson that ``if I appear to be nervous, I am. My
stomach is in knots.''
   The mayor described how he sat down several months ago to begin
composing a letter to the judge in which acknowledged he was a
recovering drug addict and alcoholic.
   ``I stand here truly remorseful,'' the mayor told Jackson.
   Prosecutor Judith E. Retchin scoffed at Barry's expressions of
contrition. ``First he blamed the government, then he blamed
Rasheeda, now he blames alcohol.''

<HEAD>Excerpts on Temple Mount Incident from Israeli Report</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Israel-Probe, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts from the probe into this
month's Temple Mount killings. The report, presented to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Friday, was translated in part by the
Government Press Office and in part by The Associated Press.
   -The Moslem gathering on the Temple Mount exceeded the intended
norms of a holy site. The members of the Waqf (Moslem religious
authority) knew that the High Court refused the Temple Mount
Faithful petition to lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple and
did not respond to requests by Israeli police officers on the
morning of the incident to calm the crowd.
   -The incident began when suddenly violent and threatening calls
were sounded on the speakers - `Allah Akbar! (God is Great),'
`Jihad (holy war),' `Itbakh Al-Yahud (slaughter the Jews).' ...
Many in the incited, rioting mob threw stones and metal objects
from a very short range, and some even wielded knives.
   -The storming of more than 2,000 Moslems toward border police,
some of whom were wounded, compelled them to use tear gas, shoot
rubber bullets and retreat in alarm. At this stage, live fire was
shot by only two commanders. At the same time, border police warned
worshipers at the Western Wall (also known as the Wailing Wall) to
begin evacuation.
   -The breaking into the Temple Mount came as a result of the
continued rioting and barrage of stones and in fear for the lives
of two policemen caught in the Temple Mount police station. ... Due
to lack of communications, the police commanders did not know that
the policemen trapped in the station succeeded in escaping on their
own.
   -The charging police forces gathered hastily. In his orders to
the forces, Jerusalem Commander Aryeh Bibi permitted use of live
ammunition in accordance with police regulations. At this point the
commander (Bibi) knew the lives of the two policemen on the Temple
Mount were in danger.
   -The forces organized randomly for the charge and not all heard
the orders. Some arrived as reinforcements from other units and
were not known to the commanders.
   -During the charge there was indiscriminate use of live
ammunition. The rescue of the two policemen trapped inside the
Temple Mount police station and the ammunition there justified a
quick operation ... The use of fire - rubber bullets and tear gas
and finally of live ammunition - against the stone throwers was
justified.
   -In other instances, in which the rioters continued to throw
stones and to threaten the lives of the charging police, use of
live ammunition was justified when police were under attack and
their lives were in danger.
   -In the advance of the police to the line of the mosques and the
police station on the Mount, the police were caught in a
life-threatening situation. The use of live ammunition was without
strict supervision by officers. Groups and individuals acted on
their own judgment north of the line of the mosques. Some were
caught in difficult situations that forced them to use their
weapons. The capture of the line between the police station and
Al-Aqsa Mosque was essential, but it is doubtful whether the
cleaning up of the area and the conduct of arrests ... was
essential in the conditions that prevailed on the Mount.
   -After the stabilization of the line between the mosques,
officers initiated actions on their own judgment. Such initiatives
in special, emergency conditions have justification, but on the
Temple Mount because of its special nature and in non-emergency
conditions, such an initiative is dangerous. There was a prominent
case in which such an initiative was taken. We did not find that
this officer's initiative caused injury or loss of life, but the
action remains grave.
   -In the incident on the Temple Mount, there was no lack of
advance information: general warnings by the GSS (General Security
Service, Israel's intelligence agency) and ... preachers, leaflets
and the numbers of groups of masked assailants who called for the
gathering on the Temple Mount.
   -The mistake of the commissioner, the commander of the Southern
District and the commander of the Jerusalem region was in the
evaluation of the information and in focusing on the assumption
that, if the laying of the cornerstone (by the zealous Temple Mount
Faithful) could be prevented, everything would settle down
peacefully, as in the past.
   -A correct reading of the situation, given the change in
circumstances and conditions, would have rendered possible the
preventive deployment action that was demanded and necessary. Given
this mistake, the police did not deploy forces along the lines of
past formats. A forward command post was not set up as it should
have been, and a deterrent force was not concentrated to intervene
as is acceptable.
   -There has to be an immediate implementation of the lessons of
Oct. 8. Faults have to be rectified. The functioning of forces in
the Temple Mount area in times of emergency, as well as under
regular conditions, has to be re-evaluated.

<HEAD>Protesting French Students Hear Promises from Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of students, some hurling eggs and others
breaking windows, marched nationwide Friday in the largest protests
in two weeks of strikes over violence and overcrowding in French
high schools.
   Premier Michel Rocard promised to create thousands of new jobs
to improve crumbling, crime-ridden high schools. But a student
leader said Rocard had failed to address basic demands for more
teachers and security guards.
   ``What we are asking for is to have toilets where we can go
without being hassled by five guys,'' said one Paris student, a
16-year-old girl.
   Most of Friday's protests unfolded peacefully. But in Mulhouse,
near the Swiss border, about 200 students threw eggs and paint at
Albert Schweitzer High School and threatened a teacher with a
knife. Police made two arrests.
   In Dijon, students broke four windows at a school.
   As he received a delegation of student leaders, Rocard issued a
statement pledging to create 6,000 new slots for teacher assistants
and 3,000 monitors. He also promised 1,000 new maintenance posts.
   In addition to their concerns about violence and overcrowding,
the protesting students have complained about rundown schools.
   Rocard said he had instructed Education Minister Lionel Jospin
to organize committees of student and teachers to ensure that
conditions improve.
   However, one student leader shot back, ``Basically, we haven't
won anything.''
   ``We'll stay in the street. We'll keep up the pressure after
vacation,'' the student said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
He spoke on the eve of a weeklong break for the nation's students.
   Despite the strikes, some students have been attending classes,
while others have boycotted them.
   Jospin said Wednesday that 100 security guards would be added to
schools most troubled by a wave of violence that touched off the
strikes two weeks ago.
   But student leaders in Paris derided the step as insufficient
and organized a march Friday on the the city's Left Bank. Police
estimated the crowd at 10,000; students said 30,000 took part.
   Sympathy strikes sprang up Friday in smaller cities. In Lyon,
about 6,000 students shouted, ``Jospin, you're finished, the
students are in the streets!''
   Police reported 7,000 demonstrators in Toulouse; 6,000 in Lille;
5,000 in Valenciennes; 4,000 each in Amiens, Saint Etienne and
Limoges; 3,000 each in Strasbourg, Metz and Bourg-en-Bresse; 2,000
each in Dole and Forbach; and 1,500 each in Avignon, Saint Avold
and Montpellier.
   Regional authorities near Montpellier, in southern France, said
four demonstrators fell off a staircase Friday and were injured.
Two were hospitalized.
   The marches began last week with a few hundred students in
low-income Paris suburbs. The violence that sent them into the
streets included the rape of a girl in a bathroom, assaults on
several teachers, and cases of extortion.
   The hardest-hit schools are those built in the 1960s near
high-rise projects hastily erected to house immigrant workers and
poor French families.

<TEXT>
   General Mikhail A. Moiseyev, the Soviet
armed forces chief of staff, suggested Friday that direct phone
links be established between NATO and Soviet command posts.
   He also proposed a permanent liaison between the panels of NATO
and Soviet chiefs of staff.
   Speaking to reporters after three days of talks with senior NATO
military and political officials, Moiseyev said the moves would
reflect the thaw in East-West relations.
   Moiseyev said phone links between NATO and Soviet command posts
could prevent a repeat of the scare on July 4, 1988, when a Soviet
combat plane strayed into NATO airspace. Its pilot had ejected over
Poland after an equipment malfunction.
   The pilotless plane overflew Germany, the Netherlands and
Belgium and crashed onto a house near the Belgian-French border,
killing one person.
   On other topics, Moiseyev said the defense of all Soviet
republics, some of which are clamoring for independence from
Moscow, must remain with the Soviet armed forces.
   He said there was no disagreement about that, not even in
republics most ardently seeking to loosen Moscow's grip on them.
   He brushed aside rumors that the armed forces might try to seize
control of the Soviet government to reverse the economic and
political changes.
   ``We support the people,'' said Moiseyev, who was flanked by
several high-ranking officers.
   ``Do we look like people who are preparing a coup d'etat? Don't
be afraid. Take it easy. And calm your colleagues,'' he told
reporters.
   Earlier in the week, Moiseyev had called for the dissolution of
NATO as a military organization saying the Warsaw Pact ``threatens
no one in the East or West.''
   NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner rejected that suggestion
in a statement Friday.
   ``We need NATO as a defense alliance,'' Woerner said. ``That
classical threat has gone ... but on the other hand there are many
risks remaining, uncertainties, instabilities - in the Soviet
Union, in Eastern Europe and in the crisis region of the (Persian)
Gulf.''
   Moiseyev said Moscow was well on its way to removing its forces
from Eastern Europe. He said 20,000 tanks, 20,000 artillery pieces
and 860 combat aircraft had already been withdrawn along with 26
submarines and 45 surface ships.
   Moiseyev said the Soviet Union was ready to negotiate the
removal of all nuclear arms from Europe. ``We would like to see a
Europe and a world free of nuclear arms,'' he said.

   Marriage can be a scary thing under normal
circumstances, but an offbeat Indiana couple want to make their
Halloween wedding as terrifying as possible.
   The groom will dress up like Frankenstein's monster. The bride
of Frankenstein will wear white, with lightning bolts in her hair.
The judge conducting the ceremony will be dressed as an undertaker.
   ``My friends think I'm crazy, but we're going to have a lot of
people talking,'' said bride-to-be Stephanie Plemmons, 23.
   She and her bridesmaids will carry orange and black flowers.
Groomsmen and ushers will wear spooky suits. The bride's 2-year-old
son will come as a green dinosaur and the flower girl will adorn
the wedding aisle with dead leaves.
   Black candles, jack-o'-lanterns carved with scary faces and
music by the band Road Kill will greet guests at a Monster Mash
reception after the ceremony Saturday. The wedding cake will be
trimmed in black and orange and decorated with a miniature
Frankenstein's monster and his bride.
   The bride-to-be said her fiance, Glen Hettenbach, 42, wasn't
thrilled by the ghoulish nuptials at first.
   ``It was my idea, but he had to think about it for a while,''
she said.
   The couple researched Mary Shelley's book ``Frankenstein'' and
the original 1935 movie starring Boris Karloff to ensure their
wedding garb would be authentic.
   Jittery grooms have been known to get a little green around the
gills as the time to tie the knot nears, but Hettenbach is going
all out - with green skin and bolts in his neck to keep his head on
straight.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, trying to escape blame for
higher taxes, accused the Democratic-controlled Congress on Friday
of creating the federal budget mess that made him abandon his
no-new-tax pledge.
   Bush also accused Democrats of playing politics with the civil
rights bill that he had vetoed on the grounds that it would force
employers to adopt hiring and promotion quotas.
   ``They're sitting around up there now,'' Bush said of Congress.
Referring to his alternative hiring-discrimination proposal, Bush
said, ``They could pass it in 20 minutes if there was a genuine
interest in civil rights and less interest in trying to embarrass
the president of the United States.''
   Bush unleashed his partisan attacks as he opened a four-day
Western campaign swing that will take him as far as Hawaii. He
spoke at a GOP fund-raiser in conservative Orange County and then
flew to Los Angeles to stump for Sen. Pete Wilson in his close race
for governor.
   Some veteran Hollywood stars turned out to welcome the
president, including Frank Sinatra, Andy Williams, Mel Torme, Buddy
Ebsen and Donald O'Connor.
   The president praised Democrats for helping forge a budget deal
but then turned around and blamed them for creating the deficit by
being on ``an uncontrolled spending binge for years.''
   ``It is the United States Congress that must be changed if this
country is going to move ahead,'' Bush said. ``You don't have to be
a rocket scientist to know that Congress has been spending more
than we take in for far too long.''
   Seizing on voters' discontent with politicians, Bush endorsed
the idea of limitations on the terms of members of Congress. He
said it was ``one way to correct the abuse of power and the
unbridled influence of an entrenched congressional staff. And I say
it's an idea whose time has come.''
   With Election Day 11 days away, Republicans are worried that
they will suffer heavier-than-expected political losses. Bush
himself has plunged in the polls amid deep Republican divisions
over taxes and confusion over the president's stands.
   In accepting his presidential nomination at the 1988 Republican
National Convention, Bush said: ``And the Congress will push me to
raise taxes, and I'll say no, and they'll push, and I'll say no,
and they'll push again. And I'll say to them: Read my lips. No new
taxes.''
   He took back that pledge back months ago, saying revenue
increases as well as spending cuts were necessary to fight the
soaring federal deficit. Congress was putting the final touches on
the budget package Friday, and Bush was expected to sign it.
   However, Bush said that Democrats in Congress were the real
problem, and he declared, ``I believe the American people have had
enough.''
   Bush met with Republican congressional leaders at the White
House on Thursday to plot the themes of his stump speeches and he
came out of the gate swinging on Friday.
   ``Some think that the differences between the parties are
blurred and to that I say nonsense,'' Bush said. ``Republicans
believe that power should be in the hands of people, not in the
government in Washington, D.C.''
   Bush said the deficit-reduction package had forced him to make
unpleasant compromises.
   ``Yes, I have had to compromise, haven't liked that a bit,'' he
said. Yet, Bush said presidents sometimes have to bend for the good
of the country.
   Even so, he placed the blame for the deficit - and thus the need
for higher taxes - squarely on the Democrats.
   In particular, Bush bridled at comments by House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, who accused the president of failing to tell
Americans ``why they were being asked to swallow strong medicine.''
   ``For 36 years his party, the Democratic Party, has controlled
the House of Representatives, and year after year after year they
have presided over these budget deficits. They have appropriated
every dime and they tell me how to spend every dime.
   ``But the American people know all too well that strong medicine
... is required because a Democratically controlled Congress simply
has been on an uncontrolled spending binge for years,'' Bush
charged.
   The president blended his attack with an appeal for approval of
the deficit-reduction deal.
   ``The agreement that we get won't be the best deal possible but
in my judgment, it will be the best deal possible with this
Congress,'' he said.
   He briefly complimented House and Senate Democratic leaders for
cooperating on the deficit-reduction plan. ``For that, I salute
them because I firmly believe that we must get an agreement to
start getting these deficits under control,'' Bush said. He did not
mention the House GOP revolt that helped scuttle the original
deficit-reduction deal.
   Democrats control the Senate by 55-45 and the House by 258-175.
Republicans had hoped to trim the Senate margin and hold their
House losses to fewer than 10 seats next month.
   In addition to his Orange County appearance, Bush was attending
a Los Angeles luncheon for Sen. Pete Wilson, who is in a tight race
for governor. With Congress still in session, Wilson remained in
Washington but spoke to the Irvine group by telephone.
   After his California appearances, the president was heading to
Hawaii to stump for Senate candidate Rep. Pat Saiki, and meet with
leaders of 11 Pacific island nations. En route home Monday, he will
make another stop for Wilson in San Francisco and then stop in
Oklahoma to campaign for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Price.

   Thousands of people were stranded without
power Friday on Hatteras Island after gale-force winds tore a
dredge from its moorings and slammed it into the Bonner Bridge,
toppling a 369-foot segment.
   The 2{-mile span - the only road link between the mainland and
Hatteras - may be closed for months.
   No injuries were reported.
   State Highway Patrol Sgt. A.C. Joyner rushed to close the bridge
early Friday after it was struck by the dredge Northerly Island.
The wind was blowing at 45-50 mph and gusting to 60 mph when the
collapse occurred less than an hour later.
   ``You could see both of the guard rails move toward the west and
then it just snapped,'' Joyner said.
   ``Nothing's built for that kind of stress,'' said Clayton
Jenson, superintendent of McLean Contracting of Chesapeake, Va.,
which built the 26-year-old bridge. Another section of the bridge
was unstable, Jenson said.
   ``It's just a guess, but I think it's going to take five to six
months to fix the bridge,'' Jenson said.
   The accident, combined with storms that kept ferries in port,
stranded thousands of people on the island and without power.
   An estimated 5,000 people live year-round on the island.
   Water supplies were limited, state officials said.
   Tourism officials said the loss of the bridge at the peak surf
fishing season could devastate Hatteras' economy.
   Authorities said ferries would be used Saturday to shuttle food,
fuel, and people across the inlet.
   The bridge carries telephone and power lines to Hatteras, and
the accident left some of those lines dangling over the inlet.
Power was out on Hatteras and on much of nearby Ocracoke Island,
home to 500-600 people. Electric and telephone companies were
waiting for weather conditions to ease before trying to restore
service.
   Gwen A. White, a Dare County spokeswoman, said the county hoped
to be able to run lines that could restore electricity within 48
hours.
   Cars lined up at the ferry landings on Hatteras and at Ocracoke,
waiting for service to resume.
   The accident came at the peak of the surf fishing months, said
Gene O'Bleness, director of the county Tourist Bureau. He estimated
that if the bridge was closed for three months, it would mean an
$18 million to $20 million loss.
   Gov. Jim Martin declared a state of emergency after flying to
the coast to survey the situation.
   State Transportation Secretary Thomas Harrelson said the state
was looking at landing points for ferries and was planning to set
up a temporary crossing of the bridge.
   ``If we could get one lane it would be a big help ... a good
shot in the arm for the people of Hatteras Island,'' Mikey Daniels,
chairman of the County Commissioners, told Martin.
   Without the bridge to Hatteras Island, the detour for someone
trying to reach Nags Head, about 10 miles north of the severed
bridge, would take more than 5{ hours. That trip includes more than
125 miles of driving and two ferry rides - one lasting 40 minutes
and another taking 2{ hours.
   Four of 10 people on the 200-foot dredge scrambled up its
3-story-high pilot's cabin to the top of the bridge before the
collapse. The six others decided to remain aboard to try to save
the vessel. The Coast Guard said they were fine.
   The dredge was under contract to the Army Corps of Engineers to
dig the channel, said Richard Adams of North American Trailing Co.
of Oakbrook, Ill., which owns the dredge.

<HEAD>Intoxicated Heart Attack Victim Dragged From Store On Stomach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor attempted on Friday to defuse racial
tensions at a grocery story after an intoxicated customer who died
of a heart attack was dragged outside on his stomach.
   Angry residents of the poor, predominantly black area were
urging a boycott of the store, owned by a family of
Korean-ancestry. The man who died, James Drumright, 57, was black
and many area residents said he would not have been dragged from
the store if he was white or Korean.
   At the request of Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke, however, residents
dispersed and owner Kenny Kang closed the B&amp;M Market for the day,
Schmoke's spokesman Clint Coleman said. Kang also apologized for
the incident.
   ``The mayor does not want the community to overreact to what is
clearly an unfortunate situation,'' Coleman said.
   Drumright lay on the sidewalk for 20 minutes Thursday morning
before a passer-by ran to a fire station for help. About the same
time, the owner came to check on the man and called 911 for an
ambulance. Drumright died a short time later at a hospital.
   Drumright had a blood-alcohol count of more than .20 percent
when he died, John Smialek, chief state medical examiner, said
after an autopsy was performed Friday. The level of legal
intoxication in the state is .10 percent. The autopsy also showed
evidence of liver disease, indicating Drumright was a chronic
alcoholic, Smialek said.
   ``We've determined that Mr. Drumright died from severe heart
disease,'' Smialek said. ``But he was also intoxicated from alcohol
so it could have been difficult for someone to tell what was
happening to him.''
   An informal picket was set up outside the store Thursday night.
Police escorted Kang out when he closed for the night.
   The store's manager, Marcus Gaffney, who is black, said Friday
he removed Drumright from the store when he found him slumped
against a meat counter with a bottle of liquor poking out of his
back pocket. Gaffney said Drumright urinated on himself when
Gaffney tried to rouse him.
   A cashier said the store owner ordered the man removed.
   ``If we had any idea he had had a heart attack, we would have
called the paramedics,'' Kang said. ``(The protestors) have a false
assumption that they dragged him out knowing he had a heart
attack.''
   Cashier Charelle M. White said Kang told Gaffney and another
worker to take the man outside.
   ``They dragged him on his stomach outside the store,'' where he
lay until paramedics were called, White said.
   Many Korean-American store owners operate in predominantly black
neighborhoods in Baltimore and cultural differences have caused
misunderstandings. Some storekeepers have been the targets of
violent crime.
   In New York City, blacks have been demonstrating over an
incident in Brooklyn in which a Haitian woman complained of being
attacked by a Korean store worker.

<HEAD>Weld Says Silber Has `Crazy Ideas' About Working Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Silber
suggested some women have neglected their children by deciding to
work outside the home.
   ``If the woman wants to be the lawyer and have the husband stay
home with the child (that) is perfectly sound,'' Silber said during
a radio interview on WHDH-AM.
   ``But what worries me is out of a desire to be as well-to-do
financially as possible, both husband and wife leave the child in
what I described as a third-rate day care center,'' he said. ``That
is happening all the time.''
   Women's groups Friday criticized Silber and Republican opponent
William Weld accused Silber of harboring ``crazy ideas.''
   Silber's position ``reeks of ... mean-spiritedness,'' said Molly
Yard, president of the National Organization for Women.
   The vast majority of parents cannot afford the choice of staying
at home to care for their children, said Ellen Convisser, president
of the National Organization for Women's Boston chapter.
   She said Silber has demonstrated ``a whole perspective of being
out of touch with reality.'' Convisser's group has not endorsed
either gubernatorial candidate.
   Regarding Weld, Silber said he did not need to be lectured by a
multimillionaire ``whose mother never worked a day in her life.''
   Ray Howell, a spokesman for Weld, said the GOP nominee's mother,
who died in 1986, taught drama at Barnard College in the 1930s and
worked as a volunteer for a non-profit company that helped place
handicapped people in jobs.

   The mother of the late AIDS victim Ryan
White has decorated his grave for Halloween with a smiling, 2-foot
plywood ghost.
   The wooden apparition is intended to represent White, who became
an international spokesman for people with AIDS. He was 18 when he
died in April of complications from the disease.
   The ghost was among other decorations placed at the grave by
Jeanne White, said her secretary, Shelly Henson.
   ``She just gets a lot of enjoyment thinking spiritually he's
aware of what's taking place,'' Ms. Henson said. ``She just thinks
he would like that.''
   A shock of cornstalks stands left of the large granite
gravestone, and a plastic skeleton and black plastic spider dangle
from a plant holder. A couple of wooden ghosts lurk in the floral
decorations, along with a plastic jack-o'-lantern and two small
pumpkins. A ghostly white windsock waves in the autumn breeze.
   ``Holidays were Ryan's favorite times, especially Christmas, and
she feels he would really like that,'' Ms. Henson said.
   White, a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS from blood-clotting
products, won a court battle to continue attending public school in
Indiana. He spent his last years speaking on behalf of AIDS
victims.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Restricting Logging In Alaska's Tongass Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Friday passed legislation to
reduce logging in Alaska's Tongass National Forest, sending the
president a bill that attempts to balance timber industry and
environmental interests.
   The measure, approved by voice vote, is the work of a
House-Senate conference committee which melded differing bills on
Tongass approved by the two bodies. The Senate gave its final
approval to the bill by voice vote Wednesday.
   Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, who fought the bill every step of its
way through Congress, said it would seriously damage the economy of
southeastern Alaska.
   ``It was not a compromise,'' he said. ``It was the environmental
groups across this nation not understanding what they were doing to
the Alaskan people.''
   But Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who chairs the subcommittee
that handled the legislation, said some factions wanted an even
bigger part of the forest removed from logging.
   ``We believe this is a compromise that brings some finality to
this issue,'' he said.
   Environmental groups for years have criticized logging practices
allowed by a 1980 law governing the 17 million-acre Tongass forest.
   Though 5.5 million acres were precluded from timber harvesting
by that law, it also contained a business arrangement with logging
companies allowing taxpayer-owned timber to be sold at extremely
low prices.
   It required $40 million of federal funds to be spent each year
on road-building and other activities to help logging companies. It
set a harvest goal of 450 million board feet a year.
   The new legislation requires the Forest Service to prepare only
enough timber for sale to meet ``market demand.'' It eliminates the
automatic appropriation of $40 million for timber management,
requiring that the forest compete with others federal forests each
year for funds in the normal budget process.
   It modifies the contracts with the timber companies working in
the Tongass to bring them in line with agreements governing other
national forests.
   The legislation also declares about 1 million acres off-limits
to timber harvesting and creates off-limits buffers 100 feet wide
along rivers and streams important to fishing. The original bill
passed by the House legislation would have protected nearly twice
as many acres from timber cutting.
   The Tongass, stretching across the Alaska panhandle, is the
country's largest national forest and home to a rich array of
wildlife including grizzly bears and bald eagles. It also is a
major source of timber.

<TEXT>
   The government Friday condemned the
country's leading writer, saying his defection to France was an
``ugly act'' that placed him ``in service of the enemies of
Albania.''
   The charge carried by the state news agency came a day after
Ismail Kadare announced his defection during a visit to France with
his wife and two daughters. France granted him immediate asylum.
   Kadare is probably Albania's best-known public figure after
President Ramiz Alia, who has been making gradual moves to lift
Albania out of three decades of virtual isolation from the rest of
the world.
   Albania on Thursday hosted its first high-level international
meeting in decades, a conference of foreign ministers from
Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and Turkey. Alia was asking
those countries to help Albania renew its ties with Europe.
   Albania, whose late President Enver Hoxha turned his back on the
Soviet Union in 1961 and China in 1977 because of the
``revisionist'' form of Communism in those countries, is seeking to
join the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
   Albania refused to sign the 1975 Helsinki human rights accords
that spawned the CSCE. The United States, the Soviet Union, Canada
and all other European nations are signatories.
   ATA reported Kadare's defection a day late, after the foreign
ministers' meeting was over. It cited foreign press reports as the
source for the news.
   ``Through this ugly act, that is a grave offense for the
patriotic and civic conscience of our people, he abandoned the
people and homeland and placed himself in service of the enemies of
Albania and the Albanian people,'' ATA said.
   The Association of Albanian Refugees in France issued a
communique in Paris criticizing France for the quickness it granted
Kadare's asylum request. It noted hundreds of Albanian refugees who
arrived in France in July are awaiting rulings on asylum
applications.
   Kadare was seen in Albania as a spiritual leader for reform and
the nation's greatest author. Last year, he was made deputy
chairman of the Communist-run Democratic Front and had begun
speaking out for human rights.
   Kadare's elevation to a leadership role indicated the ruling
party was warming to his liberal ideas. But in his statement from
Paris, Kadare said the regime was merely paying lip-service to
reform.
   ``The promises made were not kept, and my disillusion, like that
of the immense majority of Albanians, was all the more bitter,'' he
said.
   The government this year has liberalized travel regulations,
abolished the death penalty for those caught fleeing the country
illegally and lifted some restrictions on religious life.
   A draft election law published this week would allow more than
one candidate to compete for each Parliament seat and provide for
secret ballots. However, it does not foresee a multiparty system.
   About 5,000 dissatisfied Albanians took refuge last July in
foreign embassies until they were permitted to emigrate.

   Wally Hickel has moved from third to
first place in the governor's race, with a slight advantage over
Republican Arliss Sturgulewski and a significant lead over Democrat
Tony Knowles, a statewide poll indicates.
   The poll shows 35 percent of the respondents supported Hickel,
30 percent favored Sturgulewski, 24 percent preferred Knowles and
10 percent were undecided. It has a margin of error of plus or
minus 5 percentage points.
   The Anchorage Daily News and Anchorage radio station KENI
commissioned the poll by Dittman Research Corp. of Alaska. The
random telephone survey of 523 registered voters who cast ballots
in the 1988 general election or 1990 primary was conducted Monday

   Dittman's poll two weeks earlier showed Sturgulewski with 34
percent, Knowles at 29 percent and Hickel with 25 percent.

<HEAD>Wellstone Nearly Out of Money Before Latest Poll</HEAD>

   Minnesota Senate candidate Paul Wellstone
nearly ran out of money days before a newspaper poll brought his
fund-raising back to life, according to his latest campaign finance
report.
   The Democrat had $37,060 left in the bank on Oct. 17. He listed
debts of $42,007. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, on the other hand, still had
more than $1 million stashed away.
   The Republican had maintained a double-digit lead in the polls
through September and the first half of October. But Wednesday, the
Star Tribune of Minneapolis published a poll showing that the race
had closed to a statistical dead heat.
   Campaign aides say Wellstone's fund-raising picked up
considerably with the new poll.
   Wellstone reported raising $207,951 from Oct. 1 through Oct. 17
and spending $251,760. Wellstone has spent $728,708 so far this
year.
   Boschwitz, who has been winding down his fund-raising, raised
$97,703 from Oct. 1 through Oct. 17 and had $1.05 million in the
bank. He spent $158,974 during the period.
   Boschwitz has spent $2.5 million so far this year. His total
expenses since his last race in 1984 are expected to reach $7
million.

   Harold W. Vaughn, 48, was arrested Thursday afternoon after he
struck a mailbox while trying to drive into a driveway, according
to police.
   Vaughn is running for a seat on the Mount Carmel Board of Mayor

   He said he had taken a shot of vodka with a soft drink and that
apparently had an adverse reaction with some medication he was
taking.
   ``I had been doing last-minute campaigning, and I was just
tired. A friend offered me a drink,'' Vaughn said. ``I don't
usually drink. I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that. I was
just tired.''
   When asked if he believes the incident will affect the outcome
of the election, Vaughn said, ``I hope not. It was just one of

   He faces two other opponents for the city seat in Friday's

<TEXT>
   The government put former Contra
rebels in charge of the police in a northern region that witnessed
some of the heaviest fighting during Nicaragua's nine-year war, an
official said Friday.
   The unprecedented concession of power to the ex-rebels was made
by the Interior Ministry - controlled by the leftist Sandinistas
although they lost February's presidential elections - after
several weeks of disturbances in the area.
   Interior Ministry envoy Jaime Cuadra on Thursday night ordered
Sandinista Police officers in Rio Blanco, 150 miles northeast of
Managua, to withdraw to the local army battalion and turn the
police station over to the former Contras. The Sandinista police
force consisted of about 20 men.
   Cuadra also put ex-Contras in charge of the towns of Mulukuku,
Waslala and the surrounding hamlets, encompassing a rural area
inhabited by about 20,000 people.
   He told The Associated Press the move was ``provisional, until
the government makes a final decision.''
   The Contra force that will take control of the police is called
the Rural Police. The unit originally was authorized by the
government to police areas where former Contra rebels were being
resettled after laying down their arms.
   Residents of Rio Blanco had held street protests for two days
against the Sandinista Police over grievances that began when a
former Contra rebel was killed in town.
   A Sandinista Police officer suspected in the murder was arrested
and sent to the provincial capital, Matagalpa, where he was
promptly released.
   ``The authorities had given no response to complaints by the
population of crimes and abuses,'' said Rio Blanco town council
member Adonay Meza. ``That is why the people had public
demonstrations, to demand the substitution of noxious elements in
the police.''
   Cuadra's home in Matagalpa was bombed earlier this month, a few
days after he returned from putting down other Contra disturbances
in the northern towns of Quilali and Waslala.
   The residents of the region around Rio Blanco, a mountainous
area of small cattle ranches and farms, were among the strongest
backers of the Contra rebels during the war.
   About 20,000 Contra fighters demobilized in June after an
agreement with the government of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, which defeated the Sandinistas in Feb. 25 elections and
took over two months later.
   The former rebels remain deeply resentful that the Sandinistas
kept control of Nicaragua's police and army, which even retain the
name ``Sandinista'' and still are largely made up of Sandinista
Front militants.
   They also have complained that Mrs. Chamorro's government has
dragged its feet on promises to help them.
   The Contras ended the war with promises they would be given
farmland, food, clothing, medicine and materials with which to
build simple homes in the countryside. Most of the decomissioned
rebel soldiers are peasants.
   Former Contras also were involved in protests last week in the
remote Atlantic town of Puerto Cabezas, where they looted
government warehouses to protest a lack of provisions. Sandinista
police arrested 21 people.

<HEAD>Two Irishmen Fly Home from Iraq, Thanked by Saddam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Irishmen flew home from Iraq on Friday saying
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein granted them permission to leave as
thanks for good work on his new palace.
   Nick Drury, 19, and Michael Sands, 31, said they were confident
that other foreigners working on the project would soon be allowed
to leave Baghdad.
   Sands, a civil engineer, said his company had been negotiating
for six weeks for the release of all the men working on the palace.
He did not provide the name of the company.
   ``We were given a letter by Saddam Hussein after he visited the
palace saying we could all get out. He was impressed with the work
and wanted to reward the foreigners by giving them exit visas,''
Sands said.
   He said that he and Drury were the first British citizens to
test Saddam's promise. On Wednesday, 26 Portugese workers on the
project were allowed to leave, he said.
   Sands said he believed all 27 workers from Northern Ireland and
23 Britons would be allowed to leave ``over the next three weeks''
in a phased release.
   ``I am confident it will happen,'' said Drury, a student who had
initially gone to Iraq to visit his father and had taken a
temporary construction job at the palace. ``He gave us his word and
I don't think he'll go back on it.''
   Drury's father, George, was not part of the palace project and
had not been permitted to leave Baghdad.
   ``I am concerned, but he was pleased to see me getting away.
Hopefully he will be back with us by Christmas,'' Drury said.
   The two men said the foreigners remaining in the Iraqi capital
were beginning to show signs of stress.
   ``Tempers are maybe a bit shorter. But to counteract that,
people are trying to put on a good face,'' Sands said.
   He said life was ``fairly normal'' for the Britons and that they
all had enough food.
   But Drury added: ``The stress really does get to you. I never
realized it until I was actually on the plane home. It was like a
big hand being lifted from my shoulder.''
   Both men arrived at London's Heathrow Airport via Zurich and
were to continue to Belfast later Friday.
   The Foreign Office says there are about 650 Britons left in
Kuwait, mostly in hiding like other Westerners, and about 800
Britons trapped in Iraq, including 340 held at strategic locations
since the Aug. 2 invasion.
   On Wednesday, former Prime Minister Edward Heath brought home 32
holders of British passports from Iraq. The release followed two
days of negotiations between Heath and Saddam.

   Cuba's vice president said his government has
opened a dialogue with moderate exile groups that seek a transition
to democracy and the peaceful replacement of President Fidel
Castro.
   Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez's comments were broadcast
on state radio and monitored here Thursday, a week after a
coalition of moderate exile groups publicly invited discussions
about democratizing the communist nation.
   Rodriguez said Cuba shunned contacts with more militant
anti-communist exiles in Miami but confirmed the government has
opened discussions with moderates, whom he did not identify.
   He said those exiles propose ``to liquidate Fidel Castro
(through) dialogue; they are offering talks,'' The Miami Herald
reported.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department officials said they
believed it was premature to suggest the Cuban leadership was open
to democratic reform, but the Rodriguez statement was potentially
significant. The officials spoke with The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
   In Miami, Carlos Alberto Montaner, whose exile party belongs to
the moderate Cuban Democratic Platform umbrella group, said his
organization has met with Cuban officials to seek a solution to
Cuba's mounting problems.
   ``There have been indirect contacts with Carlos Rafael and other
important officials in the regime,'' Montaner said. ``We all agreed
that the era of Castro's communism has reached its end, and that we
must look for a Czechoslovakian solution before intransigence
imposes a Romanian solution on us.''
   Montaner referred to the peaceful transfer of power from
Czechoslovakia's communist leaders to the current democratic
government, in contrast to the bloody Romanian revolution that led
to the execution of former communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.
   In the long interview, the Cuban vice president divided the
exiles into three groups.
   He criticized the ``reactionary and ultrarightist'' wing headed
by Jorge Mas Canosa, who leads the powerful Cuban American National
Foundation, and Armando Valladares, U.S. representative to the U.N.
Human Rights Commission. A second group, he said, consisted of
people trying to return to Cuba for visits.
   The third group, which he did not identify by name, consists of
``ex-reactionaries'' who have abandoned violent strategies.
   ``We are increasing relations with the third group,'' he said.
``There is an ongoing process.''
   Mas dismissed Rodriguez's comments about his group, saying the
foundation and Valladares were working with the Bush administration
``to bring liberty to Cuba.''
   He said he was not aware of Cuban government conversations with
other groups.

<HEAD>Jazz Bassist Major Holley Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jazz bassist Major ``Mule'' Holley, who
performed with a long list of musical greats including Duke
Ellington, Woody Herman, Ella Fitzgerald and Benny Goodman, has
died of a heart attack. He was 66.
   Holley, a Detroit native, died Thursday night at a friend's home
in suburban Maplewood, N.J., according to his brother, Oscar
Holley.
   ``He had just returned from Germany where he did some
one-nighters and was scheduled to play on a cruise ship next
week,'' his brother said in a telephone interview from Detroit.
``He took ill on the plane and died two days later.''
   Holley, who had an apartment and music studio in Manhattan, was
a protege of jazz great Slam Stewart.
   Born Major Quincy Holley Jr., Holley's musical inspiration came
from his father, who was a bass singer.
   Holley began playing the violin at age 7 and learned the tuba
and every other wind-related instrument in the bass family as well
as piano during a 1940s stint in the Navy. That's also where he got
his nickname.
   Oscar Holley said his brother was in the Navy with Clark Terry
and as part of a band he used to carry all the instruments. ``Clark
told him he looked like a pack mule and the name just stuck.''
   Holley's first professional gig was in San Diego in 1946 where
he performed in an ensemble led by saxophonists Wardell Gray and
Dexter Gordon. He moved to New York after getting out of the
service.
   He went on to perform with a long list of music greats including
Charlie Parker, Art Tatum, Fitzgerald, the Kenny Burrell Trio,
Ellington, Oscar Peterson, Rose Murphy, Zoot Sims and Al Cohn.
   ``You name it and he played with them,'' Oscar Holley said.
   He also performed ``Mack the Knife'' on Frank Sinatra's 1986
``L.A. Is My Lady'' album, at the invitation of record producer
Quincy Jones.
   He taught at Berklee College in Boston from 1967 to 1970 and
toured Europe with the Kings of Jazz in the mid-70s.
   In a 1987 newspaper interview, Holley said he was not a jazz
pioneer.
   ``I've just continued trends. When I was in Duke Ellington's
band, I sounded like Duke's bass players. I remained applicable to
the circumstances of where I was - whether it was Coleman Hawkins
or a Broadway show or Judy Collins.''
   Holley, who was not married, is survived by five sisters and
three brothers.
   A funeral will be held Oct. 31 in Detroit.

   Unidentified assailants firing from a
speeding car on Friday assassinated an army intelligence agent who
served as a bodyguard for former military ruler Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, police said.
   Police said Sgt. Victor Valenzuela was shot five times as he
left his house Friday morning in a working-class neighborhood in
southern Santiago.
   Interior Minister Enrique Krauss said Valenzuela was a member of
the army intelligence service, and was assigned to Pinochet's
protection.
   Pinochet stepped down from power last March after ruling 16{
years, but remains commander in chief of the army.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack on Valenzuela.
   However, a local television station, Megavision Channel 9, said
pamphlets of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, a leftist
guerrilla band, were found by police in the car, which was
abandoned by the attackers.

   A woman who said she locked her
5-year-old daughter in her car because she didn't trust baby
sitters pleaded guilty Friday to a reduced charge.
   In an emotional plea for leniency, Chante Fernandez, 24,
admitted it was wrong to leave her daughter in the car while she
worked weekends at a shopping mall, but said she felt she had no
other choice.
   ``I was only trying to get us out of the situation we were in,''
Ms. Fernandez told Superior Court Judge Robert Figarotta. ``I hope
somehow you can understand.''
   Ms. Fernandez pleaded guilty to a disorderly persons offense,
was given a $100 suspended fine and was spared probation. She had
faced a maximum of 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
   Ms. Fernandez, from Elizabeth, was arrested Saturday after
police found her pajama-clad daughter Anjuli in the back of her car
at the Woodbridge Center Mall, where she worked part-time on
weekends.
   Anjuli is being cared for by the state Division of Youth and
Family Services, which scheduled an Oct. 30 hearing to determine
whether to reunite mother and daughter.
   Ms. Fernandez was initially charged with criminal restraint and
spent two days in jail before posting $5,000 bail. She faced up to
five years in prison and a $7,500 fine, but prosecutor Alan Rockoff
said he decided to reduce the charge after his office was flooded
with telephone calls in support of Ms. Fernandez.
   He said his review of the case led him to believe Anjuli was not
neglected.
   ``She has lost her child in the last several days, she has been
in the trepidation of feeling she was destitute without a job,''
Rockoff said. ``I think that's punishment enough.''
   After her arrest, Ms. Fernandez was fired from a full-time job
at an Elizabeth lumber company, but the company has since offered
to rehire her. Her former employer at the shopping mall also has
offered to make her position full-time.
   Ms. Fernandez said she left her daughter in the car while she
worked at the shopping mall because she could not find a baby
sitter she trusted. She also said she could not get government
child care services.
   She said she checked on her daughter during work breaks and left
the rear seat folded down so Anjuli could sleep in the trunk.
   Ms. Fernandez was desperate and did what she did ``out of love
for her child,'' said her lawyer, Kenneth Weimer.
   ``My client made a bad judgment call. She was up against the
wall,'' Weimer said.
   After the hearing, Ms. Fernandez and Weimer said the lenient
sentence was a surprise and that they would concentrate on
reuniting mother and daughter.

<HEAD>Mid-Atlantic Storm Strands Thousands on Hatteras Island</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gale-force winds battered the mid-Atlantic Coast on Friday,
toppling part of a bridge linking the North Carolina mainland with
Hatteras Island and leaving thousands of people stranded without
power.
   No injuries were reported in the storm that also struck the
Virginia coast, uprooting trees, downing power and phone lines and
flooding streets.
   The National Weather Service reported winds gusting to 92 mph
along the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnnel.
   The bay was ``just churning,'' said G. Wayne Brown, a Norfolk
planning commissioner. ``The water is right up to the dune line.''
   The storm was off the Delaware Coast by early afternoon and
headed northward. High wind warnings were posted over southeast New
York and northern New Jersey and storm warnings remained in effect
for the Atlantic coastal waters of Virginia, Delaware and Maryland.
   By mid-afternoon, rain was scattered from the southern coast of
Maine across the Delaware coast. Snow fell over east-central New
York. Skies were fair elsewhere.
   Rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included
two-thirds of an inch at Virginia Beach, Va.
   In the Southeast, temperatures were unseasonably cool Friday.
Low temperature records broken or tied Friday included Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., with 55 degrees, Grand Rapids, Mich., with 23
degrees, Mobile, Ala., with 37 degrees, and Ozark, Ark., with 29
degrees.
   Jamestown, N.D., and Rapid City, S.D., each had record highs of
80 degrees.
   The nation's low temperature was 17 degrees, recorded this
morning in Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 pm EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Saranac Lake, N.Y., to 98 degrees at El Cajon, Calif.

   Medicare recipients would see their
out-of-pocket health costs rise under Congress' compromise
deficit-cutting plan, but the elderly would also find new
protections against Medigap insurance abuses.
   The plan also would expand Medicaid with new spending to help
more low-income elderly pay their Medicare premiums and to provide
them with home care that could keep them out of a nursing home.
   Senior citizens say the package is kinder to them than a
previous one put together by the White House and congressional
leaders but rejected by the House. But they still say the
budget-cutting strategy hits them hard.
   ``The damages are less extensive, but it's still going to
hurt,'' said John Rother of the American Association of Retired
Persons.
   Under the plan, the elderly and disabled on Medicare would see
their monthly premiums for doctors' coverage rise from $28.60 this
year to $46.20 in 1995, and their annual deductible would go from
$75 to $100.
   Over the next five years, the plan would reduce spending on
Medicare - the fastest growing federal program - by $42 billion.
   Beneficiaries would contribute about one-quarter of that
savings, with doctors and hospitals providing most of the rest.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the Medigap changes he helped
engineer would offer seniors not only new protections against
abuses by insurance companies selling them the supplementary
health-care coverage, but the possibility of cost savings as well.
   ``This is one of the few things a member (of Congress) can take
home and say: `This will help keep your health costs down,''' Wyden
said.
   More than 80 percent of senior citizens have Medigap policies -
extra coverage beyond Medicare - and as many as 30 percent of those
have more than one. The measure would prohibit agents from selling
a policyholder duplicate coverage and would standardize coverage
into 10 different policies.
   The changes also would require Medigap insurance companies to
pay 65 cents in benefits for every dollar in premiums. If they
don't meet this loss ratio they would have to give policyholders a
refund to make up the difference, Wyden said.
   The Medicaid expansions include $580 million for use by state
Medicaid programs to cover home health care for low-income elderly
so they can avoid more costly nursing home care.
   Medicaid, which pays the Medicare premiums for senior citizens
whose incomes are up to 90 percent of the poverty line, would pay
these costs for seniors up to 120 percent of poverty by 1995.
   Another expansion was to allow more children access to Medicaid
services, but details on that were still being worked out Friday
afternoon.
   On the savings side, Medicaid would save $1.9 billion over the
five years by requiring drug companies to offer price discounts to
the program, as many companies already do for volume buyers such as
the Veterans Administration and health maintenance organizations.

   The consultant, Bernard Zettl, 65, of nearby McLean in the

to perform 150 hours of community service.
   The sentencing by U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris was the

documents among defense contractors. Five other individuals were
convicted and five companies paid fines totaling $14.9 million.
   Zettl was convicted of passing on a copy of the Pentagon's

   He testified that possession of these plans, classified secret,
was widespread in the defense industry.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Friday took a break from headaches on the home front and opened a
three-day Spanish visit, seeking to convert his personal appeal
abroad into aid for the struggling economy.
   ``Torero! Torero!'' hundreds of Spaniards, some hanging from
balconies, yelled to the 59-year-old Kremlin chief, using an
accolade usually reserved for courageous bullfighters.
   Gorbachev, grabbing Madrid Mayor Augustin Rodriguez Sahagun by
the arm, waded into the crowd, crossing yellow barriers and a
cordon of police outside Madrid's 17th-century City Hall.
   The reception served to remind Gorbachev - increasingly
unpopular at home because of worsening economic conditions and
ethnic tensions - of the respect he commands in foreign lands.
   Though Gorbachev is seeking help for the Soviet economy, he also
had some hard words for the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.
   ``We favor taking advantage of all possibilities for a
politicial solution. Nevertheless, no one should take the search
for these joint or bilateral solutions as a sign of weakness, or
for vacillation over implementation of U.N. Security Council
resolutions,'' Gorbachev told the Spanish parliament's Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   The United Nations has condemned Iraq for its Aug. 2 invasion
and ordered an international embargo on Iraqi trade to force
President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Friday told
his Spanish counterpart, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, there were
new, but still not encouraging, signals from Iraq.
   ``It appears that Iraq is searching for some kind of dialogue,
but there is no possibility of that until Iraq withdraws from
Kuwait unconditionally,'' a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman
quoted Shevardnadze as saying. The pair met at the ministry
offices.
   The ministry spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did
not elaborate on reports that Iraq might be open to discussions.
   For his part, Saddam told Channel 3 radio of Algiers, Algeria,
``When the greater interest demands it, everything is open to
consideration.'' But he went on to rule out ``ceding our rights.''
   Gorbachev was scheduled to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez later Friday and Saturday,
their spokesmen said. The two met for 2{ hours earlier Friday and
discussed European economic aid to the Soviet Union.
   It was Gorbachev's first foreign trip since receiving the Nobel
Peace Prize Oct. 15 and the first by a Soviet head of state to
Spain.
   Like the prize, the visit highlighted the importance Gorbachev's
personality has played in winning Western support for the Soviet
Union.
   ``Dobro Pozhalovat Gorbachev!'' the newspaper El Mundo trumpeted
in a front-page headline in the Cyrillic alphabet. ``Welcome
Gorbachev!''
   Smiling and looking relaxed, Gorbachev rode in a vintage Rolls
Royce from the Madrid airport to the Pardo Palace, where a band
played the Soviet and Spanish national anthems. He was accompanied
by his wife, Raisa.
   Red Soviet flags and the yellow and red Spanish flags flew
throughout downtown Madrid, and Spanish television broadcast live
Gorbachev's arrival and the official welcoming ceremony at the
palace, official residence of visiting heads of state.
   During three days of talks in Madrid and Spain's second-largest
city, Barcelona, Gorbachev will meet businessmen interested in
getting a piece of the action as the Soviet Union switches from a
centrally planned to a market economy.
   Gorbachev on Friday ordered a series of decrees that include a
sharp devaluation of the ruble and 100 percent foreign investment
in a Moscow announcement that came after he arrived in Spain.
   Foreign investment and trade is a central element of a plan to
accomplish the transformation approved by the Soviet legislature
earlier this month.
   In an interview with Spain's largest daily newspaper, El Pais,
Gorbachev made a pitch to Spanish business leaders to promote
economic ties with the Soviet Union.
   ``I think that Spanish entrepreneurs should act more vigorously
and compete more boldly with businessmen from other countries who
now show an immense interest in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Gorbachev and Gonzalez were scheduled to sign up to a dozen
accords for boosting trade and investment and improving ties.
   Under one agreement, Spain would extend the Soviets a $1.5
billion line of credit to buy Spanish equipment to modernize Soviet
plants that make consumer goods, food and construction materials.
   The Soviets plan to spend an additional $2-3 billion on Spanish
consumer goods, clothing and food, Soviet television reported.
   Gorbachev told El Pais foreign aid will be particularly
important during the next few months, when the Soviet Union begins
its transition to a market system.
   But Miguel Gil, a government undersecretary, said Gonzalez told
Gorbachev the Soviets still have ``a long way to go'' before
gaining the confidence of Western investors.
   At least one Spanish company stepped in immediately. Tabacalera,
the Spanish national tobacco monopoly, announced it would give the
Soviets 200,000 packs of Ducado cigarettes. Cigarettes are among
the many items in short supply in the Soviet Union as the old
economic structure breaks down.

<TEXT>
   A citrus industry committee on Friday
asked state and federal authorities to impose a quarantine and
fruit shipping restrictions around a grove infested with a virulent
strain of citrus canker.
   The quarantine would establish a strict inspection and
eradication program and restrict marketing of fruit from the grove
owned by Florida Citrus Commissioner Ed Smoak.
   Canker is a bacterial disease that could spread and devastate
Florida's billion-dollar citrus industry, scientists say.
   Steve Poe, a scientist representing the U.S. Department of
Agriculture on the committee investigating the canker infestation,
said the agency may impose a quarantine within the next two weeks.
   But the U.S. Department of Agriculture won't rush because the
400-acre grove is isolated and not productive, so the disease is
unlikey to spread to Florida's 700,000 acres of commercial groves.
   ``That's one reason we're taking our time on this,'' Poe said.
``It's really pretty sparsely inhabited and only a total of about
55 acres are in production in there.''
   The Asiatic or A-strain of the disease blemishes and blisters
tree stems, leaves and fruit.
   Other citrus-producing states like Texas, California and Arizona
rely on federal shipping embargoes and quarantines to keep the
disease from spreading into their groves.
   The outbreak has tentatively been traced to another small
infestation discovered elsewhere in Florida in 1986.
   State agriculture officials believe a former employee of the
canker-eradication program took infected material to his home near
the Smoak grove.
   Leon Hebb, acting director of the state's canker eradication
program, said the man may have taken the infected material for
private research.
   Poe said the USDA was working with state investigators to
determine if the man caused the infestation.
   ``It's a real detective story,'' Poe said. ``We're doing
everything to trace the whole thing down.''

<TEXT>
   The Social Democratic government began
dismantling the welfare state it built Friday, proposing sharp cuts
in benefits and state jobs to stop the country's economic decline.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson presented an austerity package to
slash $2.65 billion from the national budget and eliminate 10
percent of the approximately 185,000 civil service jobs over the
next three years.
   The government proposed cuts in sick pay, defense, education and
price subsidies in an attempt to control inflation, increase worker
productivity and restore confidence in the currency.
   ``I think voters realize that we have a problem,'' Carlsson
said.
   He acknowledged the ``forceful steps'' represent a drastic
turnaround from the traditional policies of the Social Democratic
Party, which has dominated politics in this country of 8 million
people for more than 50 years.
   In the past, the party has focused on a bigger, better public
sector with more services for the people. Now, Carlsson said, his
government aims to consider the high costs and the poor results of
some of the state's largesse.
   But union spokesmen, opposition party leaders and economists
said the proposals were insufficient to slow the 11.5 percent
inflation rate. Inflation in Western Europe averages less than 5
percent.
   Carlsson also said he would push for Sweden to join the European
Community. Militarily neutral Sweden previously has preferred to
remain outside the 12-member community of Western European nations.
   ``The conditions have improved with all that has happened in
Europe during the last year,'' he said.
   Finance Minister Alan Larsson predicted this week the austerity
measures would cause a public uproar among Swedes used to
cradle-to-grave security.
   Generous social spending and liberal working conditions have
resulted in low worker productivity, which in turn has led to high
inflation and taxes.
   Last week the Central Bank was forced to twice raise interest
rates, from 12 percent to 14 percent and then to 17 percent,
because foreign currency was flowing out of the country at the
highest rate ever amid rumors the kronor would be devalued.
   Most of Carlsson's proposals would not be implemented until
Parliament considers a new budget in January. In holding a news
conference to announce them, Carlsson hoped to stem the rumors of
instability.
   The next elections are due in September 1991$. Polls show the
lowest level of support ever for the Social Democrats, who remain
in power only because backing for conservative parties is
fragmented.
   The Moderates, the second largest party in Sweden, have been
pushing many of the proposals that Carlsson announced Friday for
years.
   About $1 billion of the cuts would come out of the state's sick
benefits program. Care of the sick has been one of the cornerstones
of Social Democratic policy.
   Swedes take an average 25 days per year of sick leave, among the
highest rates in Europe.
   Several other proposals, particularly in connection with
education, involved reallocating rather than cutting funds. The
government suggested making Sweden's higher education more
internationally competitive by diverting resources from
administration to teaching.
   It also suggested sending children to school earlier, to save
money on the vast child day-care programs.
   The government also proposed reducing tariffs, which would lower
the price of food; and increasing some real estate taxes. Food
prices in Sweden are the highest in Europe, the daily Dagens
Nyheter reported this week.

   Saturday's elections are likely
to give New Zealand a new government unless the ruling Labor Party
can win over a large segment of apathetic voters.
   Opinion polls released this week showed the conservative
National Party leading Labor by 11 to 16 percentage points, with
nearly a quarter of the electorate undecided.
   Polls had given the conservatives a 21-point lead eight weeks
ago, when Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer resigned.
   Palmer's successor, Mike Moore, 41, is a popular politician who
draws heavily for his image on his working-class backgound and
impoverished childhood with a widowed mother.
   But a sagging economy has spurred widespread disillusionment
with Labor policies and boosted the fortunes of National Party
leader Jim Bolger.
   Unemployment, at 7.9 percent the highest since since World War
II, tops voter concerns in the South Pacific island nation of 3.5
million people.
   The two main parties differ primarily on domestic issues. The
National Party has pledged to maintain Labor's ``no nuclear''
policy of refusing to allow port calls by U.S. warships because
they would not state whether they were carrying nuclear weapons.
   In response to the policy, the United States in 1986 cut
high-level contacts with New Zealand and dropped the country from
the ANZUS military alliance, which also includes Australia.
   The National Party says it would seek a reconciliation of some
sort with Washington. U.S. officials welcomed Bolger at a time hen
they were shunning top Labor officials.
   If poll results hold true, Bolger, the 54-year-old son of Irish
immigrants who left school to work on the family farm, is likely to
win a three-year term as New Zealand's 35th prime minister.
   National has pledged to cut unemployment by half, hold inflation
under 2 percent, lower taxes and hire additional police.
   Economic policy has been the most vexing problem for Labor.
Palmer became prime minister 15 months ago with the resignation of
the charismatic David Lange. Lange ostensibly quit due to health
reasons. But he also suffered from the fallout of a political
dispute over economic reform.

   A federal appeals court ruled Friday that a
board set up by Congress to regulate the safety of the government's
nuclear weapons plants cannot meet secretly.
   A three-judge panel unanimously rejected arguments by the
Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board that it was exempt from
both the Freedom of Information Act and a law requiring open
meetings by government agencies.
   ``We find nothing to indicate that Congress intended to excuse
the Board from complying with FOIA or the (Government in the)
Sunshine Act,'' the court said.
   The five-member board, appointed by the president subject to
Senate confirmation, was set up last year to police the safety of
the nuclear weapons plants operated by the Energy Department where
serious environmental problems have been uncovered in recent years.
   Until the board's creation, the Energy Department had sole
responsibility for monitoring the safety of the plants, which are
exempt from oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The commission regulates commercial nuclear power plants.
   The ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia was made on a lawsuit brought
by environmental groups to force the five-member board to hold
public meetings and respond to requests for documents.
   It reversed an earlier finding by U.S. District Judge John G.
Penn that the board was exempt from the information act and the
sunshine law.
   The five-member board has already held several secret meetings,
said Dan Reicher, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Counsil.
   Reicher said Congress created the board to ``ensure that the
long-secret environmental problems in the weapons plants were
exposed to public scrutiny.''
   ``This is the agency that is going to make some very fundamental
decisions about whether the nuclear weapons plants, which are shut
down all over the country, should be restarted,'' he said.
   ``The secrecy they were trying to maintain would have done
nothing to add to the public's faith in the decisions they made,''
Reicher said.
   The ruling against the Bush administration was the first opinion
written by Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, recently appointed by
President Bush.
   Randolph was joined by two conservative appointees of former
President Reagan, D.H. Ginsburg and James L. Buckley.
   There was no answer at the office of the board.
   Its five members are Chairman John Conway, former executive vice
president of Consolidated Edison Co.; Andrew Eggenberger, a private
nuclear energy consultant; Herbert Kouts, formerly a physicist for
the Energy Department's Brookhaven National Laboratory; John
Crawford Jr., a former deputy assistant energy secretary, and Edson
Case, a former official at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

   An attorney said Friday he hoped to force white
supremacist Tom Metzger and his son ``out of the hate business'' by
having their assets seized to satisfy a $12.5 million judgment in a
racist killing.
   Attorney James McElroy said he planned to go after all the
Metzgers' assets, including their home, bank accounts and cash
contributions sent to their white supremacist organization, the
White Aryan Resistence.
   ``We will have the very nice irony of those who are contributing
to WAR putting money in the pockets of the victims of their hate. I
think that's poetic justice,'' McElroy said.
   The elder Metzger did not immediately return a telephone message
The Associated Press left at his television repair shop in
Fallbrook, 65 miles north of San Diego.
   Monday, a Portland jury ruled in a wrongful death lawsuit that
Metzger, his 22-year-old son, John, and two of their followers
should pay damages to the family of a black man beaten to death by
racist ``skinheads.''
   The jury found that the Metzgers and WAR helped incite the hate
and violence of the Portland skinheads, including those involved in
the 1988 beating death of Ethiopian immigrant Mulugeta Seraw.
   McElroy is an associate of Morris Dees, the lead attorney for
Seraw's family. The attorneys have donated their time and any
assets seized from the Metzgers will go to Seraw's father and son,
McElroy said.
   The asset forfeiture proceedings are expected to take weeks.
   ``We have two goals: to compensate the family for the loss of
their son,'' McElroy said. ``The second goal is to put Mr. Metzger
out of the hate business. This is a for-profit business. This is
how he makes his money. He peddles hate and hate turns into
violence.''
   McElroy said the Metzgers will have to testify and produce
documents at the assets hearing.
   Attempts to hide assets or improperly transfer them to someone
else's control could lead to further penalties or even criminal
charges, he said.
   McElroy said he already has blocked a move by Metzger to
transfer ownership of the family's $90,000 home to his wife's name.
   Meanwhile, the Metzgers show no signs of abandoning their white
supremacist preachings.
   ``Don't think, because of the recent court proceedings in
Portland, Ore., that our activities will cease,'' vowed a message
on WAR's telephone hot line.
   ``This case has convinced us to go the extra mile, take the
extra steps to put the blood on the streets. We're putting the
system on notice that if you want to play hardball with the big
boys, you'd better be prepared to pay the piper.''

   Singer, writer and poet Ruth Reese has died
in Oslo, where she had lived for 30 years, friends and family said.
She was 69.
   The black artist collapsed Thursday during an address to
Norway's SOS Rasisme after the anti-racism group made her its first
honored member, said its leader Khalid Salimi. He said she died
immediately. Cause of death was not known.
   Reese was born March 10, 1921 in Alabama, grew up in Chicago and
studied music in New York and London. She settled in Norway in
1960, after having made visits to the country during her European
tours.
   She sang classical music, spirituals, gospel and blues, and had
said she wanted to increase understanding of black culture. Reese
wrote two books in Norwegian, one of which was printed in English
under the title, ``My Way.''
   Reese won the the 1989 Golden Poet award from the U.S.
association, World of Poetry, for a work called, ``To Stop a
Story,'' said Salimi.
   She is survived by her husband, Paul Shetelig.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   The governor's office Friday criticized
state Tax Commissioner John Boehm for staking out a newspaper
building where his employees had gone to complain to a reporter
that he was stifling their free speech.
   ``From this administration's viewpoint, that was a severe error
in judgment,'' said Natalie Peetz, chief of staff for Gov. Kay Orr.
``I think John realizes that and we certainly agree with his
statement.''
   ``In retrospect, I made a mistake,'' Boehm said Thursday. ``It
was an error in judgment.''
   Orr spokesman Doug Parrott said the situation ``is a
departmental matter and it is being handled at that level. Mr.
Boehm's assessment that he made a mistake is accurate.''
   Boehm was appointed to office by the Republican governor, who is
waging a tough fight for re-election against Democrat nominee Ben
Nelson.
   Earlier this month, a dozen Department of Revenue employees went
to the Journal-Star Printing Co. building to talk to a reporter.
   Boehm acknowledged that he and Deputy Tax Commissioner Anne
Erwin drove around the building, which houses the Lincoln Journal,
The Lincoln Star and Lincoln office of The Associated Press.
   A day later, Boehm distributed a memo to department
administrators. It discussed discipline for employees who made
insubordinate remarks during staff meetings about the governor,
department heads or other supervisors.
   Three of those who went to the newspaper building said Thursday
that department employees felt they put their careers in jeopardy
if they disagreed with Boehm or criticized the Orr administration.
   They said Boehm's surveillance of the building enhanced their
concerns.
   ``Their fears are unfounded,'' Boehm said. ``I went there
because I had been told that maybe 40 or 50 department people were
going to be there and I was curious. I wasn't taking names.''
   ``I knew who the ringleaders were ... everyone in the department
knew who the instigators of this were,'' Boehm said.
   Boehm said employees who talked to reporters would not be
disciplined.

   The Security Council reached broad
agreement Friday on a new draft resolution that takes a step toward
establishing Iraq's responsibility for war crimes, diplomats said.
   The resolution invites nations to collect information on serious
abuses of Kuwaitis and other civilians contrary to the Fourth
Geneva Convention and share it with the council.
   Ambassadors ranging from America's Thomas R. Pickering to Cuba's
Ricardo Alarcon said the council was now working on details of the
resolution's language and structure, and predicted a vote
overnight.
   The new resolution also would hold Iraq liable for war damages
caused by its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and invite nations,
companies and individuals suffering losses to document the damage
for the council.
   It does not provide for punitive reparations.
   The draft resolution threatens Iraq with unspecified new
punishment under the U.N. Charter if it doesn't stop mistreating
and oppressing Kuwaitis and release its foreign hostages.
   It also says Iraq must allow the immediate provision of food,
water and basic services to diplomats and foreigners in diplomatic
missions in Kuwait City.
   Iraq says Kuwait is now a province of Iraq and that the
diplomats must move their operations to Baghdad. It has cut off
water and electricity to the missions.
   All those provisions were part of a draft put forward by Britain
and the United States.
   The resolution would be the 10th since the invasion.
   In previous resolutions, the 15-member council has isolated Iraq
with an economic embargo and permitted U.N. member countries to use
their flotillas of warships in the Persian Gulf to enforce it.

   A judge said Friday he will unseal
transcripts of secret grand jury proceedings in the Charles H.
Keating Jr. securities fraud case but delayed disclosure for a week
to give lawyers a chance to appeal.
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito rejected arguments by lawyers for
the Arizona developer and his co-defendants, who said publicity
surrounding such a disclosure would damage the chances of finding
unbiased jurors for the trial.
   Ito accepted the position of lawyers for the Orange County
Register and the Los Angeles Times, which argued that First
Amendment case law supports free access to court records.
   The judge said he would excise from the 4,600-page transcript
the prosecution's opening statement and closing argument, which he
said were slanted against the defendants and might be prejudicial.
   ``If I am not precluded by any higher court, I will order next
Friday for the grand jury reporter to disseminate transcripts to
anyone with a checkbook,'' the judge said.
   The grand jury stenographer sells transcripts he produces.
   Keating, the former head of American Continental Corp., was
jailed for 33 days on a 42-count indictment. He posted a reduced
bail of $300,000 last week.
   American Continental controlled the Irvine-based Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association. Experts have estimated Lincoln's failure may
cost taxpayers $2 billion, making it the costliest thrift failure
yet.
   Keating and three top officials at his companies are charged
with setting up a scheme to steer elderly investors away from
government-insured certificates of deposits at Lincoln branches and
into risky ``junk bonds'' issued by American Continental.
   The bonds became worthless when American Continental declared
bankruptcy and Lincoln was seized by regulators.
   Prosecutors have said more than 17,000 bondholders lost more
than $250 million on the junk bonds. The indictment, however, lists
only 20 victims who lost $1.1 million. Prosecutors said they wanted
a clear, tight case.
   Keating was originally held on $5 million bail set by a state
Superior Court. A federal judge reduced the bail to $300,000,
ruling the original amount was excessively high.
   Bail was posted by family members who pledged houses as
security.
   Keating came to symbolize the excesses of the thrift industry
with his investments in risky real estate ventures and junk bonds.
He maintains he's being made a scapegoat by regulators and
legislators hoping to avert blame for the debacle.
   Keating, 66, controlled Lincoln Savings through American
Continental, drawing huge salaries and maintaining a lavish
personal lifestyle.
   The indictment carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
   The criminal case is separate from charges in civil lawsuits
that contend Keating looted Lincoln.
   Keating's lawyer suggested outside court that Keating is anxious
to testify before the Senate Ethics Committee if he is granted
immunity in return for the testimony.
   ``Mr. Keating has a wealth of information and insight,''
attorney Stephen Neal told reporters. ``If it were up to Mr.
Keating, he would be talking to all of you about it. At the present
time that is just not appropriate.
   Reports surfaced earlier this week that the committee was
considering giving Keating limited immunity to testify in its probe
of five senators to whose campaigns and causes Keating gave $1.3
million. The reports were denied.
   ``If I were an appointed or an elected public official ... I
would think long and hard about ways to enable Mr. Keating to share
the information and insights he has on all of the issues, including
campaign financing,'' Neal said.
   It was Keating's first court appearance since he was released
from jail. He stood beside his attorney but would not comment.
   Asked if he had anything to say, he declared, ``I'm hungry and
I'm going home to eat.''
   On a defense request, the judge delayed until Nov. 9 a hearing
on motions to throw out the criminal indictment.

   Th  state Supreme Court on Friday
reinstated the convictions of former executives of the Home State
Savings bank for their part in bringing down the thrift, a collapse
that shut down scores of other lenders.
   Marvin Warner, former owner of the Cincinnati-based bank, and
David Schiebel, a former bank president, were convicted in 1987 of
charges related to the thrift's failure.
   Warner was sentenced to 3{ years in prison and ordered to pay
$22 million in restitution to Ohio. Schiebel was sentenced to six
months in prison.
   Both were free pending their appeals, which succeeded last year
when a state appeals court said the lower court made prejudicial
mistakes in the bankers' trials.
   In reinstating the convictions, the high court ruled unanimously
that the trial court acted properly on all the issues. It also
affirmed $12.2 million of the restitution order. The rest was sent
back to the trial court to deal with.
   Home State failed on March 8, 1985, four days after ESM
Government Securities Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was declared
insolvent. Home State lost $144 million through its securities
transactions with ESM.
   Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other privately
insured Ohio savings and loans institutions whose deposits were
insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee Fund.
   Gov. Richard Celeste temporarily closed the thrifts and said
that to reopen they needed either to get federal deposit insurance
or merge with companies that had it.
   Warner was convicted of misapplying about $14 million of the
bank's money through unauthorized payments to ESM. Warner and
Schiebel were both convicted of securities violations for hiding
Home State's precarious financial status in a circular distributed
in 1984 to raise money for the bank.
   Warner now lives in Florida. Pat Young, a secretary for Warner,
said he had no comment.
   Schiebel's home phone number is unlisted. His lawyer, Roger
Makley, would not comment, saying he had not seen the opinion.
   Special prosecutor Lawrence Kane Jr. said the state will go to
court next week to have Warner and Schiebel start their sentences.
   The state has spent $6 million prosecuting the bankers but has
recovered $135 million through lawsuits.
   Mark Stachler, a businessman who led the Home State Depositors
Association, said he would not be satisfied until Warner was in
prison. The group was formed to lobby state officials and
legislators to protect their deposits during the crisis.
   ``I will be happy ... when Marvin Warner starts sending his
Christmas cards from the penitentiary,'' he said.
   Another former president of the thrift, Burton Bongard, was
convicted of misapplied and unauthorized transfer of funds. He
later pleaded guilty to loan violations and received a 4{-year
prison sentence. He was released on probation last year but
returned to prison after his conviction on federal charges in the
case.
   A U.S. District Court jury cleared Warner in June 1987 of
federal fraud and conspiracy charges in the failure of Home State.

   Parliament on Friday approved a motion to
train a small volunteer medical contingent for deployment with the
multinational force in Saudi Arabia, the state news agency
reported.
   The decision came one day after Vice President Atanas
Semerdzhiev returned from a mission to Iraq to seek the release of
more than 600 Bulgarians still in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   Semerdzhiev said he received assurances from Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein that all Bulgarians who have completed contracts in
Iraq may leave the country if they wish.
   He said 430 of the 690 Bulgarians in Iraq were expected to
return to Bulgaria.
   Parliament approved the decision to train volunteers for a
military medical unit which will include a group specializing in
chemical weapons defense, the state BTA news agency reported. The
size of the unit was unclear.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration for the first time
Friday declared the kingdom of Jordan in compliance with U.N.
sanctions against neighboring Iraq and suggested wealthy countries
such as Saudi Arabia help its stricken economy.
   Although State Department spokesman Richard Boucher did not
explicitly urge Saudi Arabia to end its oil cutoff and ease its icy
stance toward King Hussein's government, the message was obvious.
   ``The Saudis have been very forthcoming and generous,'' Boucher
said.
   Jordan fell into disfavor both in Washington and in Saudi Arabia
when it hesitated on applying sanctions against Iraq after the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Questions were raised about the kingdom's adherence to the ban
on trade imposed by the U.N. Security Council, although Jordan
shouldered a heavy burden of caring for refugees from Iraq.
   At the same time, King Hussein avoided criticizing Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein for his occupation of Kuwait and, along
with the Palestine Liberation Organization, staked out a middleman
role in seeking a negotiated settlement.
   The king's ambiguous approach was considered by some analysts an
attempt to stay on relatively good terms with Western democracies
while not alienating Saddam Hussein, his powerful and unpredictable
neighbor.
   Jordan's diplomatic effort has not been productive, and Jordan's
economy has continued to sink. Its treasury is short of hard
currency and trade is suffering.
   Japan, Germany and a few other wealthy countries are assisting
Jordan with aid to offset the cost of taking care of the refugees.
   Criticism of Jordan's behavior on sanctions ebbed, meanwhile,
leading up to Boucher's announcement that ``after some initial
concerns we now consider Jordanian compliance with sanctions
good.''
   The spokesman added that the United States has made known its
concerns and ``Jordan has addressed them and taken steps to meet
them.''
   Boucher said Jordan's economy ``warrants generous support.''
   Later, a U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said the Bush
administration intended to provide special assistance to Jordan
through various emergency funds.
   The idea, the official said, is to pump more hard currency into
Jordan's treasury.
   The Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan,
discussed Jordan's plight Thursday with Undersecretary of State
Robert Kimmitt. ``It is our view, Jordan's complicity warrants
generous support in the expectation that Jordan will continue to
meet its obligations to enforce U.N.-mandated sanctions,'' the
State Department said in a statement Friday night.
   Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers clashed over President
Bush's failure to declare a national emergency in activating the
reserves to support Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf.
   Short of declaring a national emergency, Bush has the authority
to activate up to 200,000 selected reserves, including combat
reserves for a period of 90 days, with a 90-day extension.
   The Senate, in giving final approval to the 1991 defense bill,
questioned a provision in the bill doubling the call-up period for
combat reserves from 180 days to 360 days.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, contended that doubling the length of time for the
call-up without declaring a national emergency goes beyond the
law's intent.
   But Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on defense, said the measure was the
only option left for his panel since Bush has failed to declare a
national emergency.
   ``We're risking the lives of 240,000 men and women. If that is
not an emergency, I don't know what is,'' Inouye said.

   Lawyer Jack Litman said Friday rehearsing for
the role of a juror in this weekend's benefit production of
``Twelve Angry Men'' reinforced his belief that intellect alone
cannot sway a jury.
   Litman is one of 12 top New York attorneys stepping inside the
jury box for the showing at a law school of Reginald Rose's play,
which starred Henry Fonda in the 1957 film version.
   ``You can't ignore the palpable emotions people have. ... You
can't address (jurors) on a purely intellectual level,'' said
Litman, a defense lawyer.
   Litman represented Robert Chambers in his 1988 murder trial.
Chambers unexpectedly pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter
in the strangulation of Jennifer Levin in Central Park in 1986.
   ``Twelve Angry Men'' is a play about a jury deciding the fate of
a boy accused of stabbing his father to death as they argued in
their tenement apartment in New York.
   As the jurors begin deliberations, there are 11 votes for a
guilty verdict and one vote for acquittal. But the lone juror in
favor of acquittal - played here by Michael Kennedy, Ivana Trump's
lawyer, and Fonda in the movie - gradually persuades the other 11
to change their votes.
   The character Litman plays - a violent man obsessed with his son
who ran away from home - is the last to change his mind.
   Among other lawyers starring in the production is Gus Newman,
the lawyer for U.S. Rep. Floyd Flake, a New York Democrat who
pleaded innocent in August to conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion
charges stemming from allegations that he diverted money from
programs of the church where he was a pastor.
   Also in the show is is Robert Fogelnest, from the so-called
pizza connection drug-trafficking conspiracy case. Thirteen men
were convicted.
   Litman, president of the New York Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers, said he came up with the idea to do the show
because ``I thought it would be a good vehicle to get away from the
frenetic law practice, have a lot of fun and raise money for a good
cause.''
   The show's proceeds will help create scholarships for Legal Aid
attorneys, public defenders and attorneys for the indigent. It was
scheduled to run Friday and Saturday nights at New York University
School of Law.
   Toni Kotite, winner of the first Bob Fosse fellowship for
directors and choreographers, said she cast Litman as Juror No. 3
because ``he is a very strong man, very driven and with a huge,
high energy level.''
   Kennedy was her choice for the Fonda role because ``his approach
to problems is laid back and he is a cool calculator. And I wanted
(Juror) No. 8 to be a man of reason but also a grand master of the
art of manipulation.''
   The lawyers were naturals for their roles, Kotite says.
   ``They are playing the jury, the people they manipulate all the
time,'' she says. ``These guys are really pretty good actors in
real life. They aren't plumbers or professors. They are used to
thinking publicly and persuading.''

<HEAD>International Aviation Group Tries to Block Iraqi Use of Jets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Civil Aviation Organization
asked member nations Friday to impound and return 15 Kuwaiti
commercial jets seized by Iraq during its invasion.
   The general assembly of the aviation organization, a U.N.
agency, made the call in a resolution that also condemned the
confiscation of the jets, now being used by Iraqi Airways.
   It was not immediately clear what impact Friday's decision might
have on Iraq's commercial air operations.
   Jaber Mubarak Al-Sabah, head of Kuwait's civil aviation
authority, praised the decision. The official said it prevents the
Iraqis from using the jets abroad, and he said they are not
suitable for domestic use.
   He called aviation agency's move a ``victory for the whole
world'' because it adds to the international outcry over Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But he also said it is unlikely the aircraft, now registered as
part of the Iraqi Airways fleet, will be returned to Kuwait.
   The motion, sponsored by Kuwait and five other Persian Gulf
states, passed without a formal vote because neither Iraq nor any
other state requested one.
   However, the Iraqi delegation had opposed the resolution, saying
the agency is a technical organization and should not consider a
motion motivated by ``political pressures.''
   ``Kuwait is a province of Iraq, and whatever is in Kuwait
belongs to Iraq,'' Tariq Salbi, head of Iraq's civil aviation
authority, said during a break in the meeting.
   The seized aircraft are valued at a total of $800 million, not
including confiscated spare parts. Iraqi Airways did not have any
jets of the type taken from Kuwait, which include five Airbus 310s
and three Airbus 300s.
   Kuwait Airways is now operating from Egypt with several planes,
including jumbo jets, that were abroad at the time of the invasion.
   Friday's resolution also calls for the return of foreign
aircraft trapped on the tarmac during the invasion, when Iraq
bombed Kuwait International Airport.
   A British Airways Boeing 747 is the only aircraft that has not
been allowed to leave the region.
   Fred Neal, head of Britain's delegation to the U.N. agency,
called on Iraq to allow the departure of the aircraft and more than
150 passengers and crew still being held.
   The 162-member International Civil Aviation Organization deals
with international safety and security issues.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Removes Ballot Proposal on Lottery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court stripped
from the Nov. 6 ballot a proposal to establish a state lottery. The
court said the wording of the referendum lacked sufficient
information.
   The justices voted 4-3 to remove the proposal, which would have
amended the state constitution.
   The decision came amid a state police investigation of
allegations from lottery opponents that some signatures on
petitions getting the proposal on the ballot were forged. Col.
Tommy Goodwin, state police director, said the inquiry won't be
stopped by the court's decision.
   In a 16-page opinion, Associate Justice David Newbern said the
referendum as explained on the ballot failed to tell voters how
much power the amendment would give the five-member lottery board.
   Those five people were already chosen and four of them were
among drafters of the referendum. The five names appeared on the
petitions, although one subsequently died.
   Newbern said the ballot title failed to mention how the
commission would be a part of the checks and balances of state
government.
   The Supreme Court also questioned the validity of signatures
gathered since the death of one of the lottery board members.
   Associate Justice Steele Hays said in a dissenting opinion that
voters, not the courts, should decide on a lottery. The Supreme
Court challenge was brought by lottery opponents.
   One man who worked to get the proposal on the ballot said Friday
the court decision was no surprise.
   ``Maybe it was the best thing that could happen,'' said Robert
Walker, referring to the controversy the referendum provoked.
   W.H. Sutton, a Little Rock attorney who led opposition to the
lottery proposal, said the court did the right thing.
   ``We're very gratified with the court's decision. It was such a
terrible amendment. It was nothing to fool around with, so I'm glad
that it's dead, no matter how it's disposed of,'' Sutton said.

   A chartered jumbo jet carrying the press
corps accompanying President Bush to Hawaii turned back over the
Pacific Ocean Friday after one engine was shut because it was
overheating.
   The Pan Am 747 landed safely at Los Angeles International
Airport and another aircraft was procured for the press corps to
resume the trip to Honolulu, where the president was making a
campaign appearance.
   Passengers on the flight which left around 3:30 p.m. noticed
that the plane shuddered twice less than an hour after takeoff.
About 80 media representatives and White House aides were aboard.
   About an hour into the flight the pilot announced that the
engine had been shut down and that a decision had been made in the
interest of safety to return to Los Angeles.
   A smaller group of reporters was flying separately with the
president aboard Air Force One, which was notified of the problems
with the press plane as it continued on its flight to Hawaii.

   In a new twist on highway robbery,
two thieves forced a taxiing jet to halt Friday, but they fled
without the huge gold shipment reportedly aboard the plane.
   The KLM Boeing 737 with 110 passengers had just landed at
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on a flight from Zurich, Switzerland,
and was rolling to the passenger gate, said KLM spokesman Nico
Harmse.
   The thieves parked a stolen airport service van on the runway,
jumped out and motioned for the pilot to stop, which he did, Harmse
said.
   They opened the jet's rear cargo hold but fled before police
arrived, and nothing was missing from the plane, National Police
spokesman Rik Hirs said.
   Dutch television and radio stations reported the thieves were
after a shipment of 770 pounds of gold worth $4.14 million. Harmse
would not confirm that account.
   The police spokesman said the attempted robbery appeared to be
an inside job. No arrests was reported.

   A school bus carrying students home
from classes ran off a road and into a gully Friday, injuring 13
children and the driver, authorities said.
   The driver lost control of the bus for unknown reasons about 4

this north-central Texas community, said Sgt. John Stahl of the

<HEAD>AIDS Victim Wants $1 Million From Dentist's Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STUART, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who says her now-dead dentist gave
her AIDS will be allowed to file a $1 million claim with his
malpractice insurance company, a judge ruled.
   Kimberly Bergalis got permission Thursday to pursue the claim
from a judge who denied approval of the dentist's will, which
leaves assets to his mother.
   Bergalis, 22, who went to Dr. David Acer to have some teeth
pulled, told reporters she doesn't want the money for herself.
   ``It's not going to buy me a cure,'' she said. ``I might not
ever see this money. It could take a year or so. I don't know if
I'll still be alive.''
   She added: ``Maybe I could take a trip somewhere, but it's not
for me. My parents are still paying off my college education. It's
for them.''
   Bergalis wants CNA Insurance Co., which provided malpractice
insurance to Acer, to pay her the maximum limit on his policy by
Nov. 1.
   If CNA refuses, Bergalis' attorneys said they would file a
lawsuit against the estate of the dentist, who died Sept. 3 of
AIDS-related cancer, and seek a much larger amount.
   ``It will be a showing of bad faith and I think they would be
liable for any award more than $1 million by a jury,'' said one of
her lawyers, David Eaton.
   The insurance company's lawyer, Dennis Vandenberg, said the
company ``probably will not pay on Nov. 1. It's too premature.''
   Bergalis' attorneys said the insurance policy is the only
``valuable'' asset of Acer's estate.
   Eaton said he plans to file a lawsuit next week against CIGNA,
the insurance firm that sent hundreds of patients, including
Bergalis, to Acer for dental care.
   Bergalis tested positive for acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. She says she is the woman referred to in a July report by
the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which said a
Florida woman had likely contracted AIDS from her dentist when he
pulled two of her teeth in 1987.
   Two days before Acer died, he wrote an open letter to his
patients, saying he doubted he had infected any patients, but he
urged them to be tested for the virus.
   State health officials said 543 of Acer's patients have been
tested at the Martin County Public Health Unit. Of the 497 results
received, two of the tests came back positive, an HRS spokeswoman
said.

<DATELINE>ERIE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Good grief, Jerry Seifert!
   The paper mill worker was picked from about 1,000 entrants as
the man who most resembles ``Peanuts'' character Charlie Brown in a
nationwide contest by United Feature Syndicate.
   To celebrate the comic strip's 40th anniversary, the syndicate
asked readers of the 1,200 U.S. newspapers that carry ``Peanuts''
to submit photographs of people who looked like Charlie and essays
about them.
   Seifert, 29, who lives with his parents near Erie, was as
wishy-washy as his look-alike when asked about the award.
   ``I guess I consider it an honor,'' he said. ``But I didn't
think I looked like Charlie Brown. I guess a few other people do.''
   Seifert's mother, Carol, submitted a photo of him with a kite
caught in a tree. She wrote in her contest essay that Seifert is
``truly a Charlie Brown in looks as well as life.''
   ``Once he borrowed a friend's new car only to have someone cross
the center line and hit him head-on,'' she wrote. ``Without a
thought of himself, he ran and gave aid to the guy who hit him.
   ``While hunting, he hit a house accidentally and gave himself
up, only to lose his hunting license ... and the list goes on.''
   Seifert won a trip for four to Knotts Berry Farm's Camp Snoopy
in Buena Park, Calif., and an original strip signed by ``Peanuts''
creator Charles Schulz.
   ``Well, I guess I'm looking forward to meeting Joe Garagiola,''
who chose him as the winner, Seifert said. ``Maybe he's really not
going to be able to meet me, though. ... I don't know.''

   Congress approved legislation Friday to give
consumers more nutrition information on the labels of the foods
they eat, sending the bill to President Bush.
   The House, on a voice vote, approved the bill passed Wednesday
by the Senate setting specific standards for nutrition labels and
requiring them to be on packaged foods.
   The legislation also mandates that bulk food in bins, raw fish
and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or brochure
providing nutritional information.
   Food sold by restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and grocers with
annual sales of less than $500,000 is exempt.
   ``Consumers have long demanded this information, but under
current law it is optional, said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.,
chairman of the Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health. ``This
bill will once and for all settle the confusion surrounding health
claims'' on food.
   Labels would be required to display:
   -Serving size.
   -Number of servings per container.
   -Calories per serving and number of caloriers from fat.
   -Amount of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total
carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber,
protein.
   The measure requires the Department of Health and Human Services
to publish draft regulations 12 months after enactment, and final
regulation six months later.
   Waxman said the bill prohibits terms like ``light, high and
low'' unless they have been defined in a manner consistent with the
Food and Drug Administration's definition.
   It forbids disease prevention claims unless the FDA has found
the contention supported by science.
   ``Health claims were not permitted on food until the 1980s,''
said Waxman. ``When the FDA relaxed its rules during the early
years of the Reagan administration, it lost control of the
marketplace and many unfounded claims began to be used for food.
   ``This bill will reorganize the marketplace so only truthful
claims can be used for food,'' he said.
   A private citizen, Phil Sokolof, of Omaha, Neb., was made an
unofficial co-sponsor of the bill for his unyielding lobbying of
the Senate to get a vote on the bill.
   Earlier this week, when the measure appeared stalled in that
body, Sokolof spent thousands of dollars of his personal fortune to
run full page ads in major newspapers calling on the senators to
pass the bill.
   ``His ads played such an important role in educating the public
and the Congress,'' said Waxman. ``What he was able to do on his
own as an individual is an inspiration. This bill is a tribute to
his tenacity.''

Hightower's loss of a fingertip in a lawnmower accident shows his
``total lack of common sense,'' his Republican rival, Rick Perry,
said Friday.
   ``It's unbelievable Perry is trying to make this a campaign

   ``It is an indication that Perry doesn't have serious programs

   Last week, Hightower cut off the tip of a finger while mowing.
   ``I managed to put my finger under a lawn mower,'' he quipped
Thursday. ``If you'll check your manual and remember what your Mama
said and what common sense tells us, is don't do that.''
   Perry said of the accident: ``It's probably a good thing
Hightower is not a farmer, because there are machines much more
dangerous than lawn mowers on the farm, like shredders and bush
hogs and balers.''

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it was recalling
55,000 cars to search for approximately 133 of them believed to
have defective driver's side air bags.
   Three other automakers - General Motors, Mazda and Honda - are
notifying owners to return another 50 cars that were equipped with
the faulty bags, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
said.
   Devices that cause the bags to inflate apparently were damaged
during assembly, the government agency said in a statement. The
manufacturer, TRW Inc., discovered the defect.
   The bags could malfunction when deployed in a crash, said Jerry
R. Curry, administrator of the agency. The bags would not inflate
properly and might eject hot gases that ordinarily would flow
through filters and cooling devices.
   ``Chances of an improper deployment during a crash are remote,''
Curry said. ``Some of the vehicles affected by this recall have
been in service for more than a year, and no improper air bag
deployments have been reported.''
   But if the bags malfunctioned, the gases could cause serious
injury, he said. ``Therefore, owners of vehicles covered by this
recall should limit their use until the vehicle has been
inspected.''
   TRW has discovered 183 potentially defective inflators and is
looking for others, Curry said.
   GM identified the owners of its 39 cars believed to have faulty
air bags and is notifying them by telephone and first-class mail, a
spokesman said. Also notifying owners are Honda, which has sold
nine affected cars, and Mazda, which has sold two.
   Ford is recalling 55,000 cars because it could not pinpoint the
133 it has sold that have the defective equipment.
   Covered by the recall are the 1990 and 1991 Ford Crown Victoria
and Mercury Grand Marquis and the 1990 Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable,
Lincoln Continental, Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz.
   Owners of those cars should take them to a dealer for
inspection. Any car found to have the defect will be repaired free.

<HEAD>Burma Military Tells Politicians to Sign Accord or Go to Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burma's military rulers are telling
their democratic opponents to either go to jail or sign an accord
with only a vague timetable for a transfer of power, a political
source in Rangoon said Friday.
   This week, authorities summoned the leaders of opposition
parties at the rate of six a day and ordered them to sign a paper
outlining the military's timetable, the source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The handcuffs were right there on the table, and they were
given the choice between a ballpoint pen or the handcuffs,'' the
source said.
   The source said the political leaders were from some of the 93
political parties that took part in the May 27 parliamentary
elections.
   The National League for Democracy won the elections, but the
military regime of Gen. Saw Maung refused to allow the winners to
take power and placed many under house arrest.
   On Tuesday, authorities detained 12 league's leaders, including
four members of its central committee.
   Opposition leaders want the parliament to begin operating in
September.
   The military says it won't step down until a new constitution is
drawn up. A conference would be convened at an unspecified date to
provide guidelines for the parliament to draft the constitution.
   Reports from Mandalay, 350 miles north of Rangoon, said troops
had raided and occupied the major Buddhist monasteries there since
Monday and detained as many as 50 monks.
   The monks have been refusing to minister to soldiers since
troops reportedly killed four people at an Aug. 8 pro-democracy
demonstration in Mandalay. The refusal is tantamount to
excommunication in the mostly Buddhist country.
   The government on Sunday empowered army commanders to try
dissident monks in military tribunals, which can dispense the death
penalty.
   Authorities in Rangoon had searched the headquarters of the
National League for Democracy each of the previous three nights and
shut some of the party's offices down, the political source said.
   The league's chairman, Tin Oo, was jailed by a military tribunal
in December on charges of subversion. Its general secretary, Aung
San Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest since July 1989. The
league's acting leader, Kyi Maung, and several other senior
officials were arrested last month.
   Amnesty International, a human rights group, says the military
government has arrested thousands of people for political reasons
since it took power by crushing a popular uprising in 1988.
Authorities at that time killed hundreds of people.

<HEAD>Europeans Threaten Retaliation for US Limit on Wine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Europe's top trade representative complained
Friday that U.S. authorities are holding up the sale of nearly $200
million worth of European wines without good reason. He threatened
retaliation.
   ``If a speedy solution is not found in the near future, the
European Community will have to consider ways to safeguard its
interests,'' said a statement issued by the community's delegation
in Washington.
   At issue in the wine fight is a chemical called procymidone,
used to kill fungi on grapevines. U.S. authorities have not
completed their investigation of it.
   Wines from the Beaujolais and Burgundy regions of France, from
the Italian region of Asti and a cooking wine from Spain are the
primary varieties affected.
   The statement in the name of Andreas van Agt, head of the
Washington delegation, did not say how the Europeans might protect
their wine trade. Often in such disputes the side that considers
itself injured stops an equivalent amount of the exports from the
offending country.
   The dispute comes at a time when the United States and the
Europeans are at odds over the bigger issue of subsidies to farm
products in general. The Bush administration wants to reduce
subsidies faster than the Europeans do. The issue is threatening
the success of four years' negotiations by about 100 countries in
the ``Uruguay round'' of trade talks trying to write new rules for
trade of all kinds before the end of this year.
   Van Agt quoted the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as
saying that it did not believe that levels of procymidone found in
imported wine amounted to a health risk.
   ``Unfortunately, it appears that notwithstanding certain
differences between E.C. and U.S. regulatory procedures, concerns
other than consumer safety appear to be involved,'' van Agt said.
   He did not specify what concerns he meant.
   European growers reportedly have been asked not to use
procymidone on plants producing for the U.S. trade and the chemical
is said to have been almost entirely eliminated this season. But
earlier vintages still have traces of it and shipments have been
held up in U.S. porss.

<TEXT>
   Wayne Gretzky, who already holds
almost every National Hockey League scoring record, became the
first player Friday to reach 2,000 points.
   The Los Angeles Kings player hit the mark when he set up a goal
by Tomas Sandstrom at 14:32 of the first period against Winnipeg.
   The game was stopped momentarily as Gretzky's teammates poured
onto the ice and a sellout crowd at the Winnipeg Arena gave Gretzky
a standing ovation.
   Gretzky, in his 12th NHL season, eclipsed Gordie Howe as the
league's all-time leading scorer with his 1,851st point Oct. 15,
1989, in a game at Edmonton.
   He has been the NHL's career assist leader since March 1, 1988,
when he passed Howe's total of 1,049. That milestone came against
the Kings, just five months before Gretzky was traded from the
Edmonton Oilers to Los Angeles. Gretzky's assist total is 1,316.
   Gretzky's 1,000th point also came against the Kings, on Dec. 19,
1984.
   Gretzky's only remaining target is the league's goal-scoring
record. He has 693 goals, fourth on the all-time list behind Howe,
with 801, Marcel Dionne, with 731, and Phil Esposito, with 717.

   Police fired on protesters in
a township outside Cape Town and black factions clashed there,
leaving eight people dead and dozens injured, police said Friday.
Four died in violence elsewhere.
   In a separate development, the South African Press Association
reported that a warrant was issued for the arrest of Winnie Mandela
after she failed to appear in court to face charges involving
alleged business irregularities. Mrs. Mandela is the wife of
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The Khayelitsha black township, about 25 miles outside Cape
Town, was generally calm Friday after the day of violence. The
fighting, which began Thursday and continued into the night, broke
out afteran explosion and fire damaged the local government
building.
   Many residents of black townships oppose the local councils and
consider council members collaborators with the country's white-led
government.
   Police fired birdshot, rubber bullets and tear gas at a crowd of
at least 800 blacks who tried to march on the government building.
   Blacks also clashed with each other and police throughout the
day Thursday. At least 50 shacks were burned.
   Police said eight people were killed in the violence, three of
them in clashes with police.
   The independent South African Press Association and several
newspapers said seven people had been killed in the clashes with
police. Police denied those reports.
   Tension has been high in Khayelitsha since the slaying last week
of Momsa Mapongwana, the wife of an anti-apartheid leader in the
township. Her funeral was scheduled for Saturday.
   A separate police statement Friday said four people were killed
in black faction fighting in Natal Province during the previous 24
hours. A group of blacks with rifles attacked a house at Ntzuma,
killing two men and wounding a woman, the statement said.
   Two black men were killed at Mnjamda, but police gave no
details.
   Three blacks were hurt in Pretoria when passengers jumped out of
a moving train after men with whips attacked people on the train,
police said Friday. The attackers in the incident late Thursday
were trying to enforce a work boycott, authorities said.
   The warrant for Mrs. Mandela's arrest was issued Thursday when
she failed to appear in a Johannesburg magistrate's court on
charges involving alleged failure to pay unemployment insurance for
employees of her food shop, the South African Press Association
said in its report.
   She allegedly failed to pay contributions between January and
August and also failed to file necessary documents relating to the
insurance contributions, the agency said.
   A warrant for Mrs. Mandela's arrest was issued in March for
failing to appear in court on similar charges, the Press
Association said.
   In April, the warrant was canceled after a fine of $40 was paid
on her behalf, as well as more than $80 owed to the unemployment
insurance fund, the news agency said.
   In February, Mrs. Mandela and seven of her former bodyguards are
scheduled to stand trial on kidnapping and assault charges
involving the alleged abduction and beating of four young men in
her Soweto home in December 1988.
   One of the youths, 14-year-old Stompie Seipei, was killed. The
former head of Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards has been convicted of
murder in the case and sentenced to death. Mrs. Mandela has denied
any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Study: Value of Harvard's South African-Related Investments
Increased</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The value of Harvard University's stake
in South Africa-related businesses has increased for the first time
in three years, a report shows.
   The improvement reflects market fluctuations, officials say.
   Harvard's direct investments in companies with South African
holdings increased 32 percent, or more than $54 million, from
December 1989 to June 1990.
   The increase was noted Thursday in the annual report of a
subcommittee of the Harvard Corporation, the school's main
governing body.
   Last year, Harvard's holdings in South Africa-related stocks
dropped 30 percent in value.
   ``This is really an accident of the market at a particular
time,'' said Elizabeth Gray, the subcommittee's secretary. ``Much
of this is due to an appreciation of stocks we already held.
There's an ebb and flow in the market and we may have a low point
in our next financial report.''
   In the past, Harvard students have staged demonstrations to
press the university to divest its holdings in companies with
business in South Africa.
   In February, South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a member of
Harvard's governing Board of Overseers, urged the school to sell
off its investments with South African ties until promised changes
are made there.
   The report said investments in companies that do business in
South Africa increased from $168.6 million to $223.3 million during
the six-month period.

<HEAD>Durkin Charges Auto PAC Trying to Buy Smith a Senate Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat John Durkin on Friday criticized a
group of auto dealers for trying to elect people who support
``Japan's right to dump whatever it wants on the U.S. market.''
   Durkin was protesting a planned television advertising campaign
against him by the Automobile Dealers and Drivers for Free Trade
PAC. Durkin is running against U.S. Rep. Bob Smith for the Senate.
   The PAC, which he said represents Japanese automakers, plans to
spend $317,200 on the ads, which begin Sunday.
   ``That is more than we're probably going to spend in this entire
campaign,'' Durkin said.
   According to the Almanac of Federal PACs 1990, the PAC's primary
objective is to promote free trade with Japan. Contributors market
Japanese-made vehicles, including Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi
and Subaru.
   Durkin refuses PAC contributions and has repeatedly attacked his
opponent for taking them.
   Smith says the groups support his pro-business positions and
denies the money influences his votes. He's raised close to $1
million, half from PACs.
   PAC spokesman Frank Glacken, based in Jamaica, N.Y., said the
auto dealers' group had no contact with Smith ``because that would
jeopardize the independence of the effort.'' He said the PAC
represents ``independent American businessmen and women who sell
imported cars all over the country.'' Glacken said the committee
opposes Durkin because he voted with labor interests when he served
in the Senate from 1975-80. Glacken said the committee gave no
money to Smith because ``that would be illegal.''
   Asked about the ad campaign, Smith spokeswoman Lisa Stocklan
said Smith ``knew nothing about it. It is not authorized by the
Smith campaign.''

   Hardly any person who pays federal taxes would
go unaffected by the tax bill on which congressional negotiators
were completing work Friday.
   Most Americans would pay higher taxes, but on their purchases
rather than on their earnings. The bite would be relatively light
for all but the well-to-do. Those with incomes over $200,000 a year
would see their federal tax liabilities rise by an average of 6.3
percent.
   Many of the 70 million couples and individuals with incomes
under $20,000 would get a slight tax cut, thanks to expansion of
the earned-income credit for poorer, working families with
children.
   The National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan organization that
campaigns for lower taxes, estimated the bill would boost the taxes
of a $30,000 family by an average of $109. A $40,000 family would
pay $166 more; at $50,000, $214; $70,000, $277 more; $100,000, $542
more, and families at the $225,000 level would face an average tax
increase of $3,572.
   Here are major provisions:
   GASOLINE: Raise the 9-cent gasoline tax to 14 cents a gallon and
the 15-cent diesel tax to 20 cents on Dec. 1. A motorist driving
10,000 miles a year in a car that gets 22 miles per gallon would
pay about $23 more.
   ALCOHOL: Double the beer tax to 32 cents a six-pack; raise the
$12.50-a-gallon tax on 100-proof liquor by $1, or 20 cents a fifth;
raise taxes on most wines, including, for example, table wine,
which would go from 3 cents a 750-milliliter bottle to 21 cents.
   TOBACCO: Raise the 16-cent cigarette tax by 4 cents in 1991 and
another 4 cents in 1993. Snuff, cigars and other tobacco would face
25 percent tax increases each year.
   AIR TRAVEL: Raise to 10 percent the 8 percent tax on airline
tickets, which had been scheduled to drop to 4 percent at year end.
The average round-trip ticket, which costs about $300, would
increase by $6.
   TELEPHONES: Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and
long-distance phone service, which otherwise would expire Dec. 31.
   LUXURIES: Impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of the price of
cars above $30,000; boats above $100,000; jewelry and furs above
$10,000 and private planes above $250,000. A $40,000 car, for
example, would face a luxury tax of $1,000.
   TAX RATES: Raise to 31 percent the 28 percent top income tax
rate paid by the 600,000 couples and individuals with the highest
incomes. That would raise taxes on singles making more than about
$125,000 a year and couples with incomes above the $200,000 range.
   Cut to 31 percent the 33 percent rate that as many as 4 million
upper-middle-income people pay on part of their earnings. This
would reduce taxes for single people with incomes between about
$60,000 and $125,000 and couples between about $100,000 and
$200,000. However, other parts of the bill would take back that tax
cut in most cases.
   Raise from 21 percent to 24 percent the alternative minimum tax,
which is paid by fewer than 100,000 high-income people with large
amounts of deductions that otherwise could reduce tax liability to
near zero.
   CAPITAL GAINS: Tax profits from the sale of investments at a
maximum rate of 28 percent. This would provide a break for those
investors who now pay a maximum rate of 33 percent. There is no
deep across-the-board cut in capital-gains taxes as President Bush
has demanded.
   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: Reduce by 3 percent the value of certain
itemized deductions that may be written off against adjusted gross
income over $100,000. Only 97 percent of deductions would be
allowed against the portion of income above $100,000; thus the
allowable deduction would be reduced by $300 for each $10,000 of
income above $100,000. The restriction would not apply to
deductions for medical expenses, casualty losses or investment
interest. The provision would affect about 2.5 million couples and
individuals.
   EXEMPTIONS: Reduce personal exemptions - which now are $2,050
for a taxpayer and each dependent - as adjusted gross income rises
above $100,000 for a single person and $150,000 for a couple. This
would raise taxes for people at those levels. The exemptions would
be reduced by 2 percent for each $2,500 that income exceeds those
thresholds. The exemptions would be lost once income tops $225,000
(single) or $275,000 (couple).
   LOW-INCOME: Increase the earned-income tax credit, which
benefits about 5 million low-income working families with children,
as a way of offsetting some of the higher excise taxes.
   MEDICARE TAXES: Increase to $125,000 the $51,300 maximum annual
wage to which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax applies. This would
affect about 8 million wage-earners. The tax is withheld as part of
the Social Security tax and paid by employees and employers.
   MEDICARE PREMIUMS: Raise the $28.60 monthly premium for Medicare
Part B insurance to $29.90 next year and $46.20 by 1995. About 30
million elderly and 3 million disabled people are enrolled in Part
B.
   MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE: Raise to $100 through 1995 the present $75
deductible, which beneficiaries must pay before Medicare starts
paying for doctor bills.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Require the 3.8 million state and local
government workers not covered by a public pension to pay Social
Security taxes.
   ENERGY INITIATIVES: Provide $2.5 billion worth of tax incentives
for increasing U.S. oil and gas exploration and production.
   EXPIRING BENEFITS: Increase through 1991 at a five-year cost of
$5.9 billion 11 targeted tax breaks that are expiring. Principal
beneficiaries include workers who receive tuition aid or group
legal services from employers; businesses that hire the poor;
investors in low-income rental housing; self-employed people who
buy their own health insurance; businesses that increase spending
for research; and low-income people buying a first home.
   BUSINESS: Raise taxes on life insurance companies by $8 billion.
Extend for five years an expiring 0.2 percent surtax that employers
pay for unemployment insurance. Raise the interest rate
corporations must pay on overdue taxes.

   The final bill dropped several provisions that had been the
subject of intense negotiations.
   Tey included: A new tax on home-heating oil; forgoing next
year's scheduled ``indexing'' adjustment of tax brackets and
exemptions, which protects against inflation; requiring that
veteran state and local government workers pay the Medicare tax;
imposing a surtax on millionaires; and allowing a special break to
high-income people who donate appreciated art works to museums.

   The IRA on Friday threatened
more reprisals against civilians working for the British military
after turning a Defense Ministry handyman into a ``human bomb''
this week.
   Police identified the man as Patrick Gillespie, 42. He was
killed Wednesday when IRA gunmen forced him to drive a 1,000-pound
bomb into a military checkpoint near Londonderry, Northern
Ireland's second city.
   Five soldiers also died in the blast and a sixth soldier was
killed in a simultaneous bombing at Newry, 100 miles southeast of
Londonderry. A bomb failed to explode in a third attack.
   In all three attacks Roman Catholic men who worked for the
British security forces were tied up inside bomb-laden vehicles and
ordered to drive into the checkpoints.
   ``Those involved in such work should desist or be prepared to
suffer the consequences,'' the outlawed Irish Republican Army said
in a statement. It was sent to the Belfast office of the British
domestic news agency, Press Association.
   The family of John McEvoy, the ``human bomb'' in the Newry
attack, said Friday they were cutting all contact with security
forces. McEvoy survived the bombing but suffered a broken leg.
   McEvoy's family owned a gasoline station outside Newry which
served security forces. ``No service will be provided for troops or
police at the service station,'' the family said in a statement
without making further comment.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule and
unite this Protestant-dominated province with the Republic of
Ireland under a leftist admiistration. The IRA is banned on both
sides of the border.
   Gunmen killed a member of the political wing of the IRA who was
visiting friends Friday near Cookstown, 30 miles west of Belfast,
police said. Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, blamed
Protestant guerrillas for the death of the man, identified as Tommy
Casey, a house painter.
   Earlier, two other victims of the spate of killings this week
were buried in separate funerals. They were a Protestant taxi
driver, William Aiken, who was shot by the IRA, and a Catholic taxi
driver, Frank Hughes, who was killed by Protestant gunmen in
retaliation.
   Three IRA suspects appeared in court in Belfast charged with the
murder last weekend of a former member of the locally recruited
army, the Ulster Defense Regiment, who was ambushed in his car.
   They were ordered held in jail until another court appearance on
Nov. 21.
   In London, six months of negotiations between Britain and the
Irish Republic aimed at restoring local government to Northern
Ireland ended in deadlock late Thursday.
   British and Irish officials said they would try to overcome
differences, but the outlook was bleak.
   ``We have gone as far as we can, and that is generally accepted.
The situation is somber,'' Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins
told reporters.
   The officials said the main sticking point was when the Irish
government should become involved in the negotiations between
Northern Ireland's Protestant and Roman Catholic leaders.
   The Irish Republic wants to be involved at every stage, while
the Protestants, who are the majority in Northern Ireland, envision
a role for Dublin only at the last stages.

   The House approved the first overhaul of
federal clean air laws in 13 years Friday night, requiring new
pollution controls to sharply reduce urban smog, acid rain and
industrial release of toxic chemicals.
   The 1,100-page bill passed by a vote of 401-25 and immediately
was sent to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, scheduled a vote Saturday.
   The cost for meeting the new requirements eventually are
expected to exceed $22 billion a year and affect virtually every
segment of society.
   Many of the handful of congressmen who opposed the measure did
so because of the burden imposed on Midwest utilities that will
have to undertake expensive measures to curb pollutants that cause
acid rain.
   But supporters hailed the legislation as the most far-reaching
piece of environmental legislation to be considered by Congress in
years. ``This bill will be the standard by which we will judge
environmental legislation in the '90s,'' declared Rep. Mike Synar,
D-Okla.
   Despite its lopsided approval, the bill was the product of
months of intense bargaining by House members among themselves
behind closed doors.
   The highly technical and far-reaching bill requires tighter
emission controls on cars, cleaner-burning gasoline blends and
pollution controls on businesses to combat urban smog.
   Smog-producing emissions from automobiles must be cut by 30
percent to 60 percent and gasoline sold in areas with smog problems
must be 15 percent cleaner toward the end of the decade.
   More than 100 cities that are failing to meet federal
air-quality standards will have to impose pollution-control plans
to bring their air into compliance over the next five to 17 years,
depending on the severity of the problem. The Los Angeles area is
given 20 years.
   At the same time, the measure directs industry to cut toxic air
pollution by 90 percent over the next eight years by installing new
pollution-control equipment to capture 189 hazardous chemicals and
requires coal-burning electric power plants to reduce chemical
releases that cause acid rain by more than 10 million tons.
   The industrial Midwest will be hit hardest because plants in
such states as Ohio, Indiana and Illinois rely heavily on
high-sulfur coal and will carry the greatest burden of reducing
sulfur dioxide emissions, which cause acid rain.
   Failure to meet the new federal requirements could open
polluters to civil penalties of up to $25,000 a day. Criminal
penalties may be sought against corporate executives for willful
release of hazardous air pollutants that pose a serious health
threat.
   Most of the new pollution requirements would be phased in over
10 to 15 years. The requirements for cleaner burning motor fuels
and reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning power
plants take effect by 1995.
   The clean-air requirements are expected to have widespread
effects on society. Consumers are likely to pay slightly more for
automobiles as well as gasoline and, in many of the Midwestern
states, more for electricity. Small businesses and huge
petrochemical plants alike will have to invest in pollution-control
equipment and improve the monitoring of chemical releases.
   Cost estimates for the new controls have varied widely. The
bill's supporters have said the legislation will cost the economy
about $10 billion a year beginning in 1995 and about $22 billion by
the year 2005, when most of the requirements will be in effect.
   Industry estimates have been much higher, with some studies
predicting annual costs from the legislation by 2005 of more than
$60 billion. Environmentalists have criticized the industry figures
as being based on ``inflated estimates and extreme or false
assumptions.''
   The latest push for overhauling the 1970 Clean Air Act, which
was last changed in 1977, began nearly 17 months ago when President
Bush unveiled his proposal for cleaning up the nation's air, noting
that for nearly a decade ``political paralysis has plagued ...
progress against air pollution.''
   But the task proved to be far from simple.
   It took three weeks of intense closed-door negotiations between
Senate leaders and the White House to craft legislation that would
satisfy divergent regional and economy interests affected by the
bill. Finally the Senate passed a bill April 3 by a vote of 89-11.
Six weeks later, the House approved its version 401-21 after also
after working out scores of tradeoffs and compromises.
   But negotiations bogged down as the House and Senate tried to
resolve differences in the two bills, each of which ran to nearly
700 pages. Facing increasing time pressures, negotiators for the
two houses finally agreed on a compromise bill Monday, barely in
time for final floor action before Congress adjourns.

   Kuwait's exiled prime minister was quoted Friday as appealing
for a military strike to oust Iraqi forces from his homeland.
Diplomats said the occupiers had seized two American men who evaded
capture for weeks.
   Iraq gave new indications it might be willing to negotiate a
settlement. President Saddam Hussein told Channel 3 radio of
Algiers, Algeria, ``When the greater interest demands it,
everything is open to consideration.'' But he went on to rule out
``ceding our rights.''
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, opening a three-day visit to
Spain, said his country favors a ``political solution.'' Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, traveling with him,
reportedly said Iraq appears to be seeking international talks.
   However, the Soviet leaders said Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait.
   President Bush has asked Secretary of State James A. Baker III
to visit Saudi Arabia early next month for discussions on the
Persian Gulf standoff, the White House said Friday. Press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said news reports that Baker would ask the Saudi
government to approve military action against Iraq were ``not
true.''
   Baker might also stop in Egypt and other countries, other
officials told The Associated Press.
   There were also reports from Washington that Saddam has adopted
a ``scorched-earth'' strategy if his troops are forced out of
Kuwait. Administration sources said Iraq had used American and
other hostages to wire Kuwait's four oil refineries with plastic
explosives capable of knocking out the emirate's entire refining
capacity.
   In his comments, Kuwait's exiled prime minister, Sheik Saad
al-Abdullah al-Sabah, urged a military strike to reclaim his own
homeland - even if it meant leaving the emirate in ruins.
   ``What is left of Kuwait after what Saddam's soldiers did to
it?'' the Saudi daily Asharq al-Awsat quoted him as saying in an
interview published Friday.
   ``As a citizen and a responsible official, I am ready to
sacrifice everything for the sake of regaining my land and
liberating it, and that is how each ordinary Kuwaiti thinks,'' said
the prime minister, who is also crown prince.
   Kuwaiti officials earlier agreed with U.S. declarations that the
international economic boycott should be given time to work before
a military attack is contemplated.
   The Americans who were seized were identified by Western
diplomats in Baghdad as Uwe Jahnke, 47, of Washington Depot, Conn.,
and John Stevenson, 44, of Panama City, Fla.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the pair
was brought to Baghdad on Oct. 22, a day after being picked up in
Kuwait,and taken to a hotel where scores of other foreigners are
being held.
   After his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Saddam prevented thousands
of foreigners from leaving Iraq and the conquered emirate. Hundreds
have since been released, but Saddam is apparently seeking anew to
pry concessions from Western governments in exchange for their
citizens' freedom.
   German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Iraq had set
a ``series of conditions'' for the release of about 400 Germans,
but that Germany would only accept their unconditional release.
   He did not list the Iraqi demands but said one was that he
himself travel to Baghdad. Genscher made his remarks after meeting
with British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, who also called for the
unconditional freeing of all foreign hostages.
   In Canada, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney rejected the idea of
sending a high-level envoy to win release of Canadian hostages in
Iraq, calling it a bid by Saddam to divide the nations allied
against him.
   ``I think a special envoy is a ploy of Saddam Hussein for
publicity purposes, for propaganda purposes, to destabilize the
solidarity of the alliance - that's all it is,'' Mulroney told
reporters in Ottawa.
   Iraq has said French nationals would be free to leave beginning
Saturday, and France has insisted no deal was struck with Saddam to
win their freedom.
   French officials also denied any knowledge Friday of a letter
Saddam reportedly sent to French and Soviet leaders offering to
discuss Mideast problems.
   French President Francois Mitterrand and Gorbachev are to hold
two days of talks in Paris beginning Sunday. The French television
network La Cinq said Saddam told the two leaders he was open ``to
all ideas'' in resolving the gulf crisis.
   ``We have no information regarding such a letter,'' said an
official at the French presidential palace.
   In his remarks in Spain, Gorbachev said Friday, ``We favor
taking advantage of all possibilities for a politicial solution.
Nevertheless, no one should take the search for these joint or
bilateral solutions as a sign of weakness, or for vacillation over
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.'' The United
Nations has condemned Iraq for its invasion and ordered an
international embargo on Iraqi trade to force Saddam to withdraw
his forces from Kuwait.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Friday told
his Spanish counterpart, Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, there were
new, but still not encouraging, signals from Iraq.
   ``It appears that Iraq is searching for some kind of dialogue,
but there is no possibility of that until Iraq withdraws from
Kuwait unconditionally,'' a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman
quoted Shevardnadze as saying.
   In Washington, the Bush administration for the first time
declared the kingdom of Jordan to be in compliance with U.N.
sanctions against Iraq. Jordan had dragged its feet on enforcing
the trade embargo, drawing the ire of both the United States and
Saudi Arabia.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher stopped short of
urging Saudi Arabia to end an oil cutoff aimed at Jordan now that
it was complying, but said its economy ``warrants generous
support.''
   Jordan was a major trading partner of Iraq before the invasion,
and it has been hit hard by the sanctions against Iraq.
   Saddam, meanwhile, was said to be seeking reconciliation with
Iraq's Kurdish minority. He has attacked the Kurds with chemical
weapons in the past.
   The Iraqi president's motives were unclear, but he could be
seeking to quell internal dissent as he faces a huge multinational
force in the gulf region.
   A report in the Baghdad newspaper al-Jumhuriya on Friday said
Saddam visited Kurdish homes in a northeast province on Thursday,
chatting and even praying with residents. Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds
have fought for decades for an independent homeland.
   In other developments:
   -Kuwait says casualties from the invasion were far higher than
initially reported. The government-run Kuwait News Agency,
monitored in Bahrain, said Friday that 4,200 Kuwaitis were killed
during the invasion. Initial reports had said several hundred died.
   -In Japan, opposition mounted to a proposal to send Japanese
troops to the gulf. Thousands of demonstrators marched on the
parliament building in Tokyo on Friday to protest the plan. Critics
claim the deployment of troops, even in non-combat roles, violates
Japan's postwar constitution.

   President Bush has asked Secretary of State
James A. Baker III to visit Saudi Arabia early next month for a
general discussion with Saudi leaders of the Persian Gulf standoff,
including military options, the White House said Friday.
   It is ``not true'' that Baker will ask the Saudi government to
approve military action against Iraq, said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``We want the United Nations resolutions to be complied with,''
Fitzwater said. There have been several Security Council
resolutions demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   No date has been set for the trip, Fitzwater said.
   Later, aboard Air Force One en route to Hawaii, Fitzwater said
Baker would discuss ``the implementation of U.N. sanctions, the
status of U.S. and multinational forces in the gulf, general
defense needs, arab unity and military options.''
   Fitzwater announced the trip in Los Angeles, where Bush was
making a campaign appearance. The president, he said, discussed
Persian Gulf matters by telephone from his hotel suite with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and
Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers.
   Baker likely will stop in Egypt and possibly other countries as
well, officials told The Associated Press.
   The secretary's itinerary will be set by Bush meeting with his
four principal advisers - Baker, Cheney, national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell -
one official said.
   A trip by Baker to the region would underscore U.S. resolve to
force Iraq out of Kuwait, which it invaded 12 weeks ago.
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said as many as
100,000 additional U.S. troops may be sent to the Persian Gulf in
response to the continuing buildup and fortification of Iraqi
occupation forces in Kuwait.
   Last month, Baker visited Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United
Arab Emirates. He also saw the ousted leaders of Kuwait during his
visit to Taif, the Saudi summer capital.
   His purposes were to coordinate strategy against Iraq and obtain
assistance from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
to help offset the costs of the U.S. military buildup in the gulf.
   Officials who discussed a possible Baker trip with The
Associated Press before Fitzwater's announcement said Baker's time
would be squeezed if he went. The United States wants new Security
Council resolutions against Iraq, and Baker will have to be
involved in planning for those.
   Among the resolutions would be a demand that Iraq pay
reparations for its annexation of Kuwait and seizure of the
emirate's oil-fields. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is a
strong advocate of the measure.
   These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Baker's trip would have three purposes: to review the campaign
against Iraq, to make further preparations and to discuss the
campaign at the United Nations which the Bush administration hopes
to push into high gear.
   And yet, they said, Baker has other commitments in the weeks
ahead. He will attend, with the President, a 34-nation summit in
Paris in mid-November and go with him to Monterrey, Mexico, after
Thanksgiving. Also, Andreotti is visiting Washington next month.

   Two men riding a motorcycle shot and
gravely wounded the director of a Central American news agency
Friday in the second such attack on a journalist in two weeks. The
journalist's wife died in the attack.
   Byron Barrera Ortiz, 37, was in critical condition. Slain was
his wife Refugio Aracely de Barrera, 39, said Fire Department
spokesman Haroldo Juarez. A friend of the couple, Luis Roberto
Gatica, 25, was wounded.
   The three were driving in a car when the motorcyclist closed in
and opened fire at close range. Humberto Gonzalez Gamarra, a radio
station owner and leftist politician, was murdered in similar
fashion on Oct. 15.
   Barrera's brother, Adolfo Barrera, blamed the attack Friday on
right-wing extremists. Death squads linked to various security
forces have been blamed for countless murders in Guatemala the last
three decades, though such cases are rarely solved.
   ``Why did they assassinate Refugio?'' Byron Barrera asked of a
small group of journalists who visited him in hospital. ``My dear
wife was the innocent victim of acts of violence like this one that
has orphaned my children.''
   ``Too much blood is being shed, and what is worse is that no one
is arrested,'' Barrera said, speaking with difficulty.
   Barrera said he became aware on Thursday that he was being
watched, and advised Claudia Arenas Bianchi, the presidential
spokeswoman. ``They were near my home and they followed me from
there to my office,'' Barrera said.
   Bianchi said Friday that President Vinicio Cerezo had ordered an
investigation. ``The government reiterates its determination to
look for those responsible in order to overcome this situation that
brings mourning to Guatemalan society,'' she said.
   Barrera fled into exile in Mexico during the 1978-82 presidency
of Gen. Romeo Lucas Garcia, a crest of official terror during which
thousands of labor leaders, politicians and social reformers were
killed or disappeared.
   He returned in 1986, after an elected civilian government took
office, and founded a liberal newspaper, La Epoca. The newspaper
was forced to close last year after its plant was destroyed in a
fire also blamed on rightists.
   Barrera, who is also vice president of the Guatemalan
Journalists' Association, left Guatemala for Costa Rica after the
fire, but returned to head the Central American News Agency, known
by its Spanish acronym ACEN-SIAG.
   There has been a sharp rise in political violence blamed on the
far right the past year. Cerezo, a Christian Democrat, has been
sharply criticized for failing to curb human rights violations.
   The climate has been particularly tense the past few weeks as
the Nov. 11 general elections near.
   One leading candidate, former President Jose Efrain Rios Montt,
a retired general, was ruled ineligible because of a constitutional
clause that prohibits former dictators from being elected
president. But Rios Montt has continued to campaign, and accused
Cerezo's government of plotting electoral fraud.
   Another candidate, Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo of Cerezo's centrist
Christian Democratic Party, has been critically ill in the hospital
since Wednesday with acute inflammation of the pancreas.
   Cerezo decided to cancel a trip to Honduras because of his
friend's illness, said Foreign Minister Ariel Rivera Irias.
   Both she and Col. Carlos Fernando Duran, the army spokesman,
denied rumors Cerezo had postponed his trip due to restiveness in
the army because of Rios Montt's removal from the presidential
race.
   Besides Rios Montt, the presidential field includes 12
candidates.

<HEAD>Trial To Be Held In El Paso Despite Publicity</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A convicted rapist accused of killing six
women and girls and burying them in the desert will be tried here
despite wide publicity about the case, a judge ruled Friday.
   District Judge Peter Peca decided against ruling on a motion he
filed himself earlier this month to move the trial of David Leonard
Wood outside the city.
   But Peca also said he will make a list of alternate venues if
attorneys are unable to find an unbiased jury in El Paso.
   Wood denies he killed the women.
   Despite the publicity, neither prosecutors nor Wood's attorneys
wanted to move the trial, which was set to begin Jan. 14.
   A grand jury indicted Wood on July 13 on capital murder charges
in the deaths of of six El Paso women. Their bodies were found
between Sept. 4, 1987, and March 14, 1988, in shallow graves about
18 miles northeast of El Paso.
   Wood is serving a 50-year sentence for a 1987 rape that occurred
near where the bodies were found.
   If convicted of the capital murder charges, he could face life
in prison or the death penalty.

   A couple who say they snatched their
ailing child from a Tennessee welfare office out of love plan to
fight extradition attempts in a legal tangle that started with a
stolen car, a lawyer said Friday.
   ``The correct result from the standpoint of the child is for him
to remain in Massachusetts and for the family to be reunited,''
said Meade Burrows, the father's attorney.
   ``They have family here and the baby was being treated by
doctors here,'' he said.
   The couple appeared at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Michael
A. Ponsor.
   Paul Thaddeus Komorowski, 28, and his pregnant wife, Candy, 18,
were jailed after they called the FBI Wednesday from a friend's
home in nearby Chicopee and surrendered with their 23-month-old
son, John Paul.
   They said they wanted to spend time with the child, who has
tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   The parents were accused of making off with their son after
visiting him at a Bristol, Tenn., welfare office Oct. 17.
   ``We love him so much and there is not much time in his life,''
Komorowski said.
   ``We gave him a good time and did things like visit Disney World
and went swimming, things he may never be able to do again. And he
was fine. He did not get sick,'' he said in an interview before his
arrest.
   The couple's troubles in Tennessee began in June as they were
driving through he state on their way to Texas and the boy
suffered a seizure, said Kenneth Neiman, Mrs. Komorowski's lawyer.
   Driving to a hospital they were pulled over by police, who
discovered the car had been reported stolen in Massachusetts. The
police arrested Komorowski. When Springfield police declined to
seek extradition, the father was indicted on Tennessee charges of
possession of stolen property.
   Komorowski spent three months in jail before pleading guilty
Sept. 6. He was then placed on one year's probation.
   Meanwhile, the Tennessee Department of Human Services obtained
legal custody of the child, Neiman said.
   Now Tennessee officials want the parents brought back to face
charges of interfering with custodial care. Ponsor set hearings on
the request for next Friday.
   Even if the judge agrees, more hearings would be required in
Massachusetts courts before Tennessee authorities could take the
parents, lawyers said.
   The baby was examined by doctors and ``seems to be doing fine,''
said Lorraine Carli, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department
of Social Services.
   She said the baby was placed temporarily in a foster home and
doctors were conducting tests to further check his condition.

   A midshipman was expelled from the Naval
Academy for having sex on campus with a woman who had accused him
of rape.
   The junior midshipman, who was not identified by the academy,
was initially accused of raping the woman, but academy spokesman
Noel Milan said investigators never found enough evidence to
support the allegation.
   ``Very early on, it was determined that there was not enough
evidence to proceed with the (rape) case,'' Milan said.
   The student told authorities he met the woman at a downtown bar,
brought her back to the academy and had sex with her early May 13,
a Navy official said.
   The midshipman was found guilty of violating a rule that bars
midshipmen from having sex on academy grounds and expelled earlier
this month, Milan said. Officials are considering whether the
midshipman may also have to reimburse the academy for his
education.
   ``That decision is yet to be made,'' Milan said.
   The expelled student may be required to serve time in the Navy
or reimburse the Navy for the cost of his education.
   The expulsion is the latest of several reports of mistreatment
involving the 4,500-student academy.
   Annapolis police are investigating a report that a midshipman
broke into a woman's home Sept. 8 and chased her around her house
until she locked herself in a bedroom.
   A female midshipman resigned last spring after reporting she was
handcuffed to a urinal. Other women and minorities later came
forward with stories of mistreatment at the academy by male
officers and students.

   Drivers, smokers and drinkers are about to be
socked to cut the federal deficit. But many wealthy Americans,
especially those with big families, may feel they're being soaked.
   A $150 billion, five-year tax increase making its way through
Congress would hit especially hard at high-income people. One new
provision affecting the well-to-do is being criticized as nothing
less than a tax on children.
   It would phase out the tax saving from personal exemptions as
family income rises above $150,000 a year. Losing that tax saving
would have the effect of raising the marginal tax rate on those
families - and the larger the family, the higher the rate.
   ``The dependent exemption is the most vital pro-family feature
of the income tax code,'' Gary L. Bauer, president of the
conservative Family Research Council, said Thursday. ``By phasing
out this exemption, members of Congress are thumbing their noses at
the practice of adjusting tax liability to reflect differences in
household size.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Pentagon is sending additional troops to
Saudi Arabia partly to counter a recent hardening of Iraq's
defenses in occupied Kuwait, officials say.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday that more American
GIs - possibly as many as 100,000 - will be shipped to the Saudi
desert to join the 220,000 U.S. forces already in the Persian Gulf
area following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   He said no final decision has been made on which additional
units will be sent.
   Cheney and other officials said the troop addition does not
signal a switch in U.S. policy from defending against a possible
Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia to laying the groundwork for an
offensive against Iraq.

   MOSCOW (AP) - Kazakhstan has become the 14th of the 15 Soviet
republics to declare sovereignty, defying the national legislature
and banning nuclear tests on its territory in Central Asia, Soviet
media reported.
   The action Thursday came after environmental activists claimed
Kazakhstan's 15 million people suffer an elevated cancer rate and
other health problems because it is the site of one of the
country's main testing grounds for nuclear warheads.
   In Moldavia today, authorities in the republic bordering Romania
planned to send police to the Gagauz region, where an ethnic
minority has declared sovereignty and begun holding elections.
   Busloads of college-age volunteers were also headed for the area
today.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Republicans enlisted Bart Simpson without his

``Distortions, She Wrote.''
   It's lights, camera and political action in Hollywood, where a
few golden words from a celebrity can speak decibels louder than
dozens of stump speeches by politicians.
   Movie and television stars are getting behind gubernatorial
candidates from both parties, as well as Big Green, a sweeping
state environmental initiative.
   ``There are many entertainers who by their past work have become
trusted by the public, and for them to research and then support an

   NEW YORK (AP) - Management published the Daily News today
despite a strike. Delivery trucks driven by non-union replacement
drivers ran a gantlet of pickets throwing rocks and bottles.
   Police reported seven arrests but no serious injuries.
   The strike called Thursday night at the nation's second-largest
metropolitan daily newspaper capped a 10-month dispute over
management's efforts to gain more control over operations.
   Police in riot gear escorted delivery trucks out of a Daily News
printing plant in Kearny, N.J., through hundreds of strikers
hurling bricks, stones, eggs and bottles. Vehicle windows were
covered with protective tape to prevent shattered glass from
injuring those inside.

   STRASBURG, N.D. (AP) - Resentment is bubbling over congressional
approval of $500,000 to restore the birthplace of Lawrence Welk,
the king of champagne music.
   The project's leader defended the plan to renovate the sod
farmhouse where Welk was born and develop a German-Russian history
museum and other tourist attractions.
   ``People are saying we're taking money away from farmers. It's
not so,'' Rosemary Schaefbauer, president of Welk Heritage Inc.,
said Thursday. ``This money was allocated for rural development.
North Dakota is going to benefit a whole lot from it.''
   The grant is included in a $52.2 billion agricultural
appropriations bill that the House passed Monday and sent to
President Bush.

<HEAD>Dolly Parton Says ``Merry Christmas'' - In October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are those who would say ``Bah, humbug!''
to the idea of taping a Christmas show in October. Dolly Parton is
not one of them.
   In fact, she was talking about it on the phone recently from her
East Tennessee theme park, Dollywood, in Pigeon Force. She had just
finished a Christmas show there that ABC will air in early
December.
   She even admitted to doing a little studio work on the show in
July, when she also recorded a Christmas album with the same name
as her special - ``Home for Christmas.''
   Weird as it may sound, it isn't all that unusual for show folk
with busy schedules to tape their Christmas specials a tad early,
even during muggy summers, when Santa's ``ho-ho-ho'' is more of a
``gasp-gasp-gasp.''
   It's not odd, she said, ``not if if you're a show person and not
if that's the only way you can do it. And if you've got a
child-like spirit, which I do, you can make it happen nearly all
the time.''
   The tiny star, whose nature tends to be sunny side up, has had a
good run as a singer, songwriter and actress, despite such
accidents as the film version of ``Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas.''
   Last year, she was in a film success as a co-star of ``Steel
Magnolias.''
   This brought new film and television offers, she reports:
``Anytime you have a successful thing, it always opens up new stuff
for you.''
   In the wings, for example, is a gospel musical film for
Paramount, ``Sister Sunshine,'' about the rise and fall of a female
evangelist, she says. She's also recording a new album next month,
``Eagle When She Flies.''
   And farther down the country road is a planned TV movie - all
three networks are interested, she says - she'd film in Nashville.
It's called ``Beula Faye.'' She hopes it'd lead to a TV series,
also done in Nashville.
   The film is about the country music business, she said. She'd
play ``a singer-host of a television show. It's about the
lifestyle, about being on the road and work in the studio and
trying to keep the business running.
   ``It's something I've wanted to do for a long time, and
basically it's what I had tried and wanted to do with my other TV
show that got so out of hand.''
   She meant ABC's splashy ``Dolly'' variety series of 1987, yet
another network attempt to apply Hollywood flash to country music.
Begun in a blaze of publicity, it fizzled out in one season.
   ``It never really got off on the right foot,'' Parton said,
although she readily took responsiblity for what happened. ``It was
so hyped, had so much attention drawn to it, we never really had a
chance.''
   When and if she returns to a TV series in ``Beula Faye,'' she
said, ``I hope not to advertise it all that much, and just let the
people decide. At least it won't be under such a magnifying
glass.''
   That was one main problem with ``Dolly,'' she said. The other
was ``too many chiefs and not enough Indians.''
   By chiefs she meant a swarm of executives from New York and
Hollywood who ran around the show, issuing orders, giving advice,
changing orders and throwing Tums at each other.
   She indicated it might have been wise to have the Jolly Green
Giant sit on them until each show was finished.
   ``But it's okay,'' she said. ``I learned a lot from it, a lot of
things not to do.''
   A major ``not'' is not to do another series in any place but
Nashville.
   ``Most of these people ain't willing to move to the South,'' she
said. ``I'd be safe here.''

   America burned while Washington fiddled.
   That's what Albert Sindlinger said to himself as the numbers
came from his computers. They showed 10 more states had fallen into
recession in the two weeks ended October 22, while Congress debated
and delayed the budget.
   ``I was prepared for bad news,'' he said, ``but nothing like
this.''
   Sindlinger, a student of economics and politics for more than 60
years, has been analyzing them professionally for more than three
decades. His information comes from the people. His staff
telephones hundreds each week.
   Much of the resulting information is distributed to corporate
customers, whose marketing departments pay dearly for it, and to
analysts of various sorts. Washington, too. His latest report, he
says, will wake them up.
   That report shows a deepening recession that envelopes the
District of Columbia and all but 10 of the lower 48 contiguous
states. The rest are weakening steadily. He does not measure Alaska
or Hawaii.
   The 10 states that fell into recession during the past two weeks
included what had been some of the strongest, such as Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, ``states that had been
holding the economy together.''
   They not only fell, he said, they fell badly. They leave only
Nevada, Washington and Oregon still safely in economic plus
territory. The others - Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Missouri,
Minnesota and Kansas - are borderline.
   Among the questions asked by Sindlinger &amp; Co. from its office in
Wallingford, Pa., is one on the president's popularity. That too
has taken a nosedive, from 82.6 percent positive on Sept. 17 to
54.9 percent Oct. 22.
   Especially irritating, he says, is that much of the economic and
political damage could have been avoided. He contends that if
government hadn't fudged job and gross national product figures, a
recession would have been obvious.
   Had that been the case, the threat of automatic cuts via the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act would have been lifted, and so also the
necessity of making drastic budget cuts. A recession threat would
have delayed enforcement.
   Instead, Congress remained confronted with the threat of
automatic cuts, sought to avoid that eventuality but instead got
caught up in what much of the country viewed as a futile debate.
The economy sank, said Sindlinger.
   The octogenarian analyst, who says he got some of his polling
ideas from none other than a pre-White House Herbert Hoover, knows
all this, he says, because survey respondents express their
feelings in each 12-minute interview.
   ``They're scared to death,'' he said. ``They're angry, concerned
and disgusted.'' Moreover, he said, their pocketbooks are hurting.
   Sindlinger's staff determines if a household is in recession
through a measurement it calls household liquidity, based on
answers to four questions.
   A household is said to have negative liquidity when any question
is answered negatively, and a state is said to be in recession when
more than half the households fall into the negative category.
These are the questions:
   1. Is total combined household annual income up or the same as
it was six months ago?
   2. Will the total combined household's annual income remain the
same or be higher six months from now?
   3. Will there be more or the same number of jobs where you work
six months hence?
   4. Will business conditions be the same or better in your
community six months from now?
   Eight hundred five calls were made in the week ended October 22,
making a total of 3,283 for the four weeks September 28 - October
22.
   Those 3,283 sample calls were projected to be representative of
90.82 million telephone households and a total of 156.47 million
heads of households. Of the latter, only 61.006 million, or about
39 percent, had positive liquidity.
   To Sindlinger, the big political question is whether a
disgruntled public will simply stay home and not vote, or will they
vote and take out their anger on incumbents?

   The International Monetary Fund, which pumps
billions of dollars into debt-plagued economies around the world,
is taking on a project closer to home - building a new church for a
small congregation that's been its neighbor since 1973.
   Some time in the next few weeks, the IMF expects to close a deal
to acquire the quarter-acre property of the Western Presbyterian
Church, bringing to a close negotiations that began in the 1960s.
   In return, the fund is buying a new site, a few blocks away,
where it will build Western Presbyterian a new, slightly larger
home with a kitchen for feeding the homeless.
   It will move the church's English Gothic sanctuary, fieldstone
by fieldstone and stained glass window by stained glass window, and
rebuild it as part of the new structure.
   Not only that, it will provide Western Presbyterian with an
endowment, reported to be $4 million, to do such things as
construct housing for the homeless and help two congregations in
Ghana build churches.
   All in all, counting acquisition costs and an $8.5 million
construction budget, the deal totals around $22.5 million.
   So how did a church with about 135 worshipers on a good Sunday
come into such a bonanza?
   One might say by being in the right place at the right time.
   In the 1960s, the IMF, a specialized agency of the United
Nations with the mission of stabilizing currency exchange, found
itself short of space and in need of a new home.
   It found the location it wanted, three blocks from the White
House and next door to the World Bank.
   ``Since the block was residentially zoned at the time, the only
way the IMF could get the bulk and density it wanted for an office
building was to offer forth a plan that contemplated developing the
entire block,'' said James B. Kaiser, IMF projects manager.
   There was just one problem. The Western Presbyterian
congregation didn't want to move from the block.
   The church, started in 1855, was already in its third home. Its
first was a warehouse not far from the new site. After a few years
there, the congregation built a new church across the street from
its present structure. It moved to its current location in 1935.
   ``The sanctuary is gorgeous, and they didn't want to lose
that,'' said the Rev. John W. Wimberly Jr., pastor of Western
Presbyterian.
   Also, they might have had to move out into the suburbs, where
land prices are somewhat cheaper.
   ``There was considerable sentiment about the symbolic value of
having the building located here, in the middle of what people call
the Wall Street of the World,'' Wimberly said.
   So the IMF proceeded to develop the rest of the block, finishing
one phase in 1973 and the second 10 years later, with the church
nestled into a U-shaped green space.
   Meanwhile the fund's staff continued to grow. It now numbers
about 2,000 from 100 countries. Since only 1,700 could be squeezed
into the building, the agency paid an estimated $3 million a year
to lease office space for the other 300.
   ``It came to our attention a couple of years ago that there had
been some changes that would make it more favorable for us to
reopen negotiations,'' said Kaiser.
   The church was growing, too. When Wimberly became its pastor in
1983, he said, there had been about 90 people in the congregation
and most of them were over 65. Now about half of the 135 worshipers
are 45 or younger.
   Western Presbyterian began feeding the homeless, and now feeds
about 200, using a kitchen designed for potluck suppers. It threw
open its doors for noontime meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous and
groups grappling with drug problems.
   The church was still reluctant to move, and the IMF asked if
there were any conditions under which the congregation might
consider it.
   Western Presbyterian listed some:
   -They wouldn't leave the neighborhood.
   -IMF would have to rebuild the sanctuary as it was.
   -They would need a commercial kitchen to feed the homeless.
   -They wanted air conditioning and underground parking, neither
of which the present church has.
   -IMF would pay the lawyers and the architects.
   -The job would be done in phases, so the congregation would not
miss a day of worship or the homeless miss a meal.
   -IMF would create an endowment to enable the church to expand
its mission.
   ``We debated it at great length and finally took a vote and the
vote was 2-1 in favor of making the move,'' Wiberly said.
   The executive board of the IMF also approved.
   Architect David Cox said it is hoped that construction can start
in the spring and be completed in about two years. Kaiser said IMF
hopes to start work on its expansion at that time.
   ``The fact the IMF was willing to take the sanctuary with us, I
think, was at the crux of it,'' said Wimberly. ``We could say,
`When you go down there, you're not going to be worshiping in some
glass palace or something.' People become very, very involved with
the place where they worship. It is a beautiful sanctuary. There is
something very humble in its beauty that kind of matches a lot of
the people that worship here.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though they were planted in a less than ideal
climate, the seeds of a new investment product appear to be taking
root on Wall Street.
   The securities in question, known as long-term stock options,
made their debut Oct. 5 at the Chicago Board Options Exchange and
the American Stock Exchange.
   Since then the number of these options outstanding in the two
markets has increased steadily, surpassing 6,000 by late lsst week.
   Observers describe that as a respectable showing, especially
given the depressed state of enthusiasm right now for just about
anything associated with stocks.
   ``It's very hard to persuade people to enter the stock market
these days, let alone the options market,'' says Harrison Roth, an
options specialist at the firm of Cowen &amp; Co. ``It's still a little
too early to tell, but I think this product will be successful.''
   At the CBOE these vehicles are known by the trademarked anagram
LEAPS, for long-term equity anticipation securities. The Amex has
been content so far with the generic name long-term stock options.
   Whatever you call them, they are closely related to the
short-term options on individual stocks that have been bought and
sold on Wall Street for decades in two basic forms: Calls, which
give their owners the right to buy a specified stock at a set price
within a stated time period, and puts, which carry the right to
sell the stock in question under similar terms.
   Conventional puts and calls traded in organized markets
generally have lives of nine months or less. The new long-term
options, by contrast, can run for as long as almost two years.
   To would-be speculators in options, that can represent a big
difference. They might, for instance, feel much more confident
staking their money on the chances for a market recovery by
mid-1992 than by next spring or summer.
   But the extra time comes at a price. Last Thursday, for example,
when the stock price of Merck &amp; Co. stood at $81.87, a call option
to buy 100 shares at $95 between now and January went for $50,
excluding commissions.
   LEAPS at that same price, not due to expire until July of 1992,
traded at $687.50 apiece, reflecting the significantly better
chance that Merck stock will climb above $95 in the next 15 months
than within 90 days or so.
   That example illustrates how important it is in options trading
to be able to evaluate relative levels of option ``premiums'' - the
time value built into their prices over and above their worth if
they were exercised immediately.
   In some ways at least, long-term options can be seen as a more
conservative vehicle than their established short-term cousins.
   Roth suggests that investors who can't commit the time and
energy required for short-term options trading may have a better
chance at operating successfully in the long-term arena.
   ``You still have to keep track of your investment,'' he advises,
``but you may not need to monitor it every day hour-by-hour.''
   Furthermore, if strategies employed with long-term options
require less frequent buying and selling than is common with
short-term contracts, the burden of commission costs can be
lightened.
   No matter what the scheduled life of a stock option, some things
remain the same. A call on a stock that never reaches the exercise
price can be relied on to approach a value of zero by the time it
expires.
   Risks can be even greater for investors who ``write'' (create
and sell) calls on stock they don't own, or engage in other
unprotected maneuvers.
   Says Roth: ``The obvious comment here has to be `look before you
LEAP.'''

   The opening of the Berlin Wall did far more than
allow East Germans to dance across broken concrete into the
dazzling world outside. It let the outside world come in.
   Less than a year later, two nations were wiped off the map and
replaced with one.
   Breaching the barrier was a desperate act by a dying regime
trying to placate a people massed in revolt.
   Although the opening of the wall Nov. 9, 1989, took the
unromantic form of lifting travel restrictions, everyone recognized
it as the end of the Cold War's most famous symbol. It was the
dominant image in a breathtaking year of revolution in the Soviet
bloc.
   What no one predicted was the resulting maelstrom of forces that
led to German unity, an inexorable process that forced the
superpowers to recognize a new world order and reach new levels of
cooperation.
   Today, the nation that built the Berlin Wall is a territory
transformed, no longer a Communist state, no longer a closed
society, no longer a nation.
   It is a region whose destiny lies completely in the hands of
people who live in what used to be another country.
   Uniting with mighty West Germany has given the East Germans an
experienced hand to lead them and a mattress stuffed with money to
rest on.
   But it also has forced the old nation to make Eastern Europe's
fastest, most turbulent, most radical transition to a free-market
democracy after four decades of sleepy, unchanging communism.
   Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary are
proceeding much more gently, by comparison dipping a toe into the
cold waters of capitalism as they peer through the dust and smoke
of their revolutions.
   So swiftly has East Germany become distinct from its neighbors
that ``it is inaccurate and unfair to even compare them,'' said
Heinrich Vogel, an analyst at the Federal Institute for Eastern
Economic and International Studies in Cologne.
   He said eastern Germany is in ``a distinctly privileged
situation,'' sharing a language, legal system, government, currency
and borders with a rich and stable region.
   East Germany also has thrown its fate to the West, however,
while the other former Soviet satellites still have autonomy and
some control of their destiny on the longer, less certain road to
prosperity.
   What eastern Germany has in common with the other former
Communist states are profound similarities in public mood.
   ``They are all sharing exaggerated expectations to a large
extent,'' Vogel said. ``They have all inherited the structural
handicaps, the mental decay, the system of mistrusting each other
and society.''
   In eastern Germany, Westerners have seized control swiftly, from
the man in charge of selling its factories to the governor of its
largest state to clever squatters who have claimed its vacant
tenements.
   Leading eastern politicians have western campaign managers and
aides. The East German women's swimming team, which dominated the
world for years, has a West German coach.
   Children who have been drilled their entire classroom lives in
the correctness of communism are using estern textbooks.
   The food in the old nation's stores, the cars on its streets,
the money in its banks and the flag flown atop its public buildings
- all have changed in the single year from revolution to
reunifiction.
   Political extremism, overt racism, crime and drug abuse have
crept through the wall or simmered up from the darkest corners of a
long-suppressed national psyche.
   Embracing the West has ruined the homegrown economy and its
overstaffed, inefficient enterprises, which once were the strongest
of the Soviet bloc but now are literally being killed by the
competition.
   Since March, about one-fourth of the 8 million workers in
eastern Germany have lost their jobs or are working fewer hours at
lower, government-subsidized wages.
   A recent report by the five leading German economic institutes
said nearly 4 million could be in the same situation next year, and
that the pace of recovery was much slower than expected.
   Except for some perky areas of the service industry, virtually
no sector of the eastern economy can survive without western help,
said economist Heine Flassbeck of Berlin, one of the report's
authors.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government, facing national elections
Dec. 2, has dismissed the report as too pessimistic.
   Hans Peter Stihl, president of the German Chamber of Commerce,
said a new survey showed half of all western German businesses will
have invested in the east by the end of 1991.
   If there is disagreement over the timetable for eastern
Germany's elevation to western standards, there is little doubt
about its inevitability.
   On a single day soon after the Germanys were joined Oct. 3,
three unrelated announcements illustrated why East Germany was more
fortunate than its old Warsaw Pact allies:
   -Mercedes-Benz said it would begin building cars at a struggling
East German truck plant near Berlin, saving or creating 6,000 jobs.
   -The government increased pensions to help 2.7 million retired
people pay higher prices and rents.
   -Another department announced plans to spend 10 billion marks
($6.5 billion) on fixing up 300,000 homes.
   Romania, Poland and the other former Communist states could use
a day like that, but many of citizens have decided not to wait for
it.
   Thousands of Eastern Europeans have poured into eastern Germany
in hopes it will be the new gateway to the West, creating a German
immigration crisis.
   Soviet soldiers, who once died by the millions fighting the
Nazis and now must leave the nation they conquered, are deserting
in hundreds and asking to stay.
   Even Jews, subjected to hideous crimes under Hitler, are
arriving from the Soviet Union in search of better lives.
   All this in a country millions of people could not wait to leave
last year, where pent-up desperation brought down the hard-line
Communist leader, Erich Honecker.
   The uprising forced his successor, Egon Krenz, to bow even more
to the masses and do the unbelievable: change history in a single
autumn day by opening the Berlin Wall.

   They came by the millions, pouring through the new
gaps in the Berlin Wall, rejoicing in the simple ability to move
freely in their city for the first time in nearly three decades.
   When East Germany suddenly announced on Nov. 9, 1989 that it was
opening its borders, I witnessed an outpouring of joy that became
the biggest party Berlin has ever seen.
   It was nearly 7 p.m. when the stunning announcement was made at
a news conference in East Berlin.
   I jumped into a car and toured several border crossings at the
wall. Confused guards on both sides still could not say exactly
when unhindered passage would be allowed.
   As midnight approached, thousands of East Germans massed on the
eastern side of the barrier that symbolized the Cold War. At
midnight, they rushed through crossing points, some on foot, some
in sputtering Trabant cars.
   West Berliners greeted them with champagne, tapping on the roofs
of the cars in boisterous welcome.
   At Checkpoint Charlie, Germans from both sides kissed, cried for
joy and danced. Relatives embraced for the first time in a
generation.
   I saw East German border guards transformed in minutes from
dour, arrogant guardians of communism into friendly helpers,
smiling and chatting with West Berlin police. They even stopped
checking documents.
   Hundreds of people danced atop the wal at the Brandenburg Gate
in one of the most memorable scenes of that incredible Thursday
night.
   By 2 a.m., West Berlin was one gigantic party. Thousands of
people streamed along the glittering Kurfuerstendamm outside the
Associated Press office.
   Authorities had closed the street to traffic and it became a sea
of people, ebbing and flowing in the chilly night to marvel at the
wonders of capitalism.
   A giant screen on a department store alternated announcements
that the wall was open with flashes of ``Welcome, Welcome'' to the
visitors from the east.
   Hardly anyone slept in Berlin. Bars stayed open through the
night, offering free drinks to East Germans.
   At 5 a.m., I set out on the 10-minute walk from the AP office to
my hotel, and spent nearly an hour wading through the dancing and
singing crowds. Strangers hugged me. Others handed me paper cups
filled with champagne.
   At 8 a.m., I watched the East Germans open a large section of
the wall at Bernauer Strasse, where some of the most spectacular
escapes and bloody failures had taken place.
   That weekend, Berlin became one, months before the official
reunification of Germany.

   When Bernhard Leich and his family loaded
their Trabi for the long trip to freedom a year ago, he had no idea
they were helping arrange East Germany's funeral.
   The Leichs are among tens of thousands of East Germans whose
flight through Hungary and Czechoslovakia helped reunite the
nation. They have a good life in western Germany now, in the
Bavarian town of Hof.
   On Oct. 2, 1989, Leich, his wife Christine and their two
children chugged for Prague in their blue Trabant to join other
East Germans waiting to go West.
   ``At the border, customs officials tore our car apart and asked
us endless questions, like `Don't the children have to go to
school?' and `Where are you going to stay?'' Leich recalled.
   They crossed into Czechoslovakia and reached Prague, left the
car and went by taxi to the West German Embassy. More than 10,000
East Germans waiting for trains to take them West had turned the
embassy grounds into a squalid refugee camp.
   After two nights there, the refugees crowded into the unheated
cars of special trains East Germany provided for the last leg of
their journey to freedom.
   In the first part of the trip, through southern East Germany,
police beat back people who tried to jump aboard as the trains
passed slowly through stations.
   Leich, 33, saw a young woman with a child trying to board at
Plauen, East Germany. A security officer led the woman away.
   ``People were screaming out the windows, but there was nothing
anyone could do,'' he said.
   On Oct. 5, The Leichs' train arrived at Hof. On Nov. 9, East
Germany opened the Berlin Wall in a desperate attempt to stop the
mass flight.
   Bernhard Leich found work as an electrician in Hof and Christine
is a saleswoman. Daniel, 8, likes his school and Stefanie, 5, has
new friends.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl recommended last month that emigres
return to eastern Germany to help build the united country, but
Leich says that's out of the question.
   ``I've been able to put my own life back together in the year
I've been here,'' he said. ``My wife and I have jobs, a home and
the kids are happy. If we went back, we'd have to start out all
over again.''
   There are reports that the exodus from former East Germany has
not stopped since the union Oct. 3.
   German news reports say people from poor eastern Germany have
been crossing into the wealthy west at the rate of 30,000 a month.
   Leich never got his Trabi back and isn't sure where it is.
   ``I was told it was taken back to the DDR (East Germany), but I
haven't been able to find it,'' he said. ``Maybe some old Communist
has it now.''

   Democrats expect to improve their hold on the
nation's governorships this year, but they face tough battles to
wrest control of the largest states from the Republicans.
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, the head of the Democratic Governors'
Association, predicts a net gain of one to four governorships for
his party this year.
   Republicans, who gained eight seats when many of these same
governors were up four years ago, would be content just to hold
their own this time.
   Democrats have the upper hand in the nation's statehouses going
into the elections, controlling 29 governorships to the GOP's 21.
But the party that controls the biggest states will be pleased no
matter the outcome of the rest.
   ``Much more important than the raw number of gains or losses is
which states go which way,'' says political analyst Charlie Cook.
``Unlike House or Senate seats, all governorships are not created
equal, and it is the megastates this year that really count.''
   The reason is redistricting. Legislatures will draw new
congressional district lines next year that may change of face of
their U.S. House delegations. Both parties would like to hold the
veto stamp in states facing big gains or losses in their
congressional delegations.
   Republicans control the governorships in four of the biggest
states that are up this year: California, Texas, Florida and
Illinois.
   California's legislature will figure out how to distribute as
many as seven new congressional seats next year, based on the
state's population gain in preliminary Census figures. Democrats
control the legislature there, and Republicans say they need the
governorship to ensure a fair map.
   Texas and Florida will gain new House seats too, while Illinois
stands to lose two seats.
   In only one of those states, Florida, is the incumbent seeking
re-election. Florida Gov. Bob Martinez has come from behind to a
virtual tie with Democratic challenger Lawton Chiles, the former
senator.
   The high-stakes California race is considered deadlocked too.
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson faces Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the
former mayor of San Francisco. Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is
retiring after two terms.
   In Texas, flamboyant Republican Clayton Williams has held a lead
over Democrat Ann Richards. Richards has pulled closer in recent
polls, however, and has accused Williams' campaign of encouraging
reports she once used drugs.
   In Illinois, Republican Jim Edgar once led in his bid to replace
retiring Gov. Jim Thompson. But in a reversal of normal tax
rhetoric it is the Democrat, Neil Hartigan, who has trumpeted a
no-tax pledge to turn the race into a tossup.
   Among the Democratic governors who control big states,
Michigan's Gov. Jim Blanchard has a substantial lead in his bid for
a third term. New York Gov. Mario Cuomo is a sure thing for
re-election. So is Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, the most prominent
anti-abortion Democrat.
   In other contested states that Democrats now control:
   - Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis retires reviled just two
years after leading his party to presidential defeat. Democrat John
Silber, a university president, won the nomination in a repudiation
of Dukakis. He leads his GOP opponent, although Republican William
Weld is within striking distance.
   - Republican George Voinovich, the former Cleveland mayor, leads
in the Ohio governor's race, where Democrat Celeste is retiring.
The Democratic candidate, Anthony Celebrezze, has tried to make his
support for abortion rights a deciding issue. But Celebrezze has
been criticized for his dramatic switch from an abortion opponent
late last year.
   - Minnesota was a state Republicans had hopes of reclaiming from
Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich. But Republican Jon Grunseth's chances
plummeted with allegations that he swam nude with teen-age girls at
a party nine years ago and invited some as young as 13 and 14 to
join him.
   GOP primary loser Arne Carlson has entered as a write-in
candidate, and Grunseth went to the brink of withdrawal before
deciding to remain in the race. Republican frustration with the
turmoil is increased by polls showing a variety of GOP candidates
other than Grunseth would defeat Perpich in a two-way race.
   ``Our base simply is not big enough to cut it in half,'' said
Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., who has his own re-election worries.
``We're going to have to some way repair that situation.''
   - Democrats are in danger of losing Connecticut, where Gov.
William O'Neill is retiring. The Democratic nominee is running
third behind former GOP Sen. Lowell Weicker, who is running as an
independent.
   - In Oregon, another state where a Democrat is retiring, the
race between Republican Dave Frohnmayer and Democrat Barbara
Roberts is close.
   Republican incumbents are in danger in at least four states:
Rhode Island, Nebraska, Kansas and Maine.
   Worst for Republicans is Rhode Island, where Gov. Ed DiPrete is
far behind Democrat Bruce Sundlun, who lost to DiPrete in the last
two elections.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr and her Kansas neighbor, Mike Hayden, both
have been in trouble for tax increases, but both have narrowed the
gap by which they trailed Democratic challengers.
   Hayden has rebounded as his Democratic opponent, Joan Finney,
has struggled to explain her opposition to abortion. Recent polls
have shown Hayden winning the women's vote.
   Maine's Republican Gov. John McKernan has also made a partial
recovery in the polls but still faces a tough race with Joseph
Brennan, a former governor who replaced McKernan in Congress four
years ago.
   Among other Republican incumbents, Alabama's Guy Hunt and Iowa's
Terry Branstad both hold leads against strong challengers.
   Republicans face uphill battles to hang on in Oklahoma and New
Mexico, where GOP incumbents are retiring. Democrats expect to hang
on to the Arizona seat, which they took over when Republican Gov.
Evan Mecham was impeached.
   In Alaska, the entry of former GOP Gov. Walter Hickel as

<HEAD>Recession: Blame It On Credit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By the time the current economic slump goes into
the history books, many Wall Street analysts believe it will be
recorded as a recession bought with credit.
   They see debt problems as by far the most menacing worry facing
the stock market and the economy, overshadowing other issues like
soaring oil prices and falling consumer confidence.
   Should widespread forecasts of only a moderate recession, ending
some time next year, prove too optimistic, these observers say an
upheaval in the banking and credit system will very likely be the
culprit.
   In the same vein, they contend that an eventual recovery in
economic growth, corporate profits and stock prices will depend to
a great degree on how well the process of cleaning up the credit
mess goes.
   ``The recession that we think began in the summer started like
no other in the postwar period,'' said Jack Lavery, director of
global research at Merrill Lynch.
   ``On the negative side, financial stresses are much more
pronounced and widespread, and policymakers can do little to
stimulate the economy.
   ``On the plus side, the excesses in the real economy, which
usually intensify a downturn, are actually mild.''
   If there is such a thing as a typical recession, it unfolds as
unsold inventories of goods back up in the pipelines of the
economy. That, in turn, forces manufacturers to cut back
production.
   Unemployment heads upward with layoffs in the producing,
distribution and retailing sectors of the economy as the business
slowdown takes hold.
   The whole process begins to reverse, however, as the surplus
inventories are worked off.
   This time around, analysts maintain, there is no glaring problem
with inventories of conventional merchandise. Instead, they say,
the system is clogged by bad debts and assets financed with those
debts - most notably, real estate that nobody wants to buy or
occupy.
   ``The easy credit conditions of the 1980s have led to excesses
in both the real estate market and in corporate America,'' says
Suresh Bhirud, chief portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``The banking systems' loan portfolios have suffered significant
writeoffs as a result of these problems.
   ``The banks' ability to make new loans has diminished
dramatically. This is not surprising considering that in many cases
the balance sheet of the lender may be even weaker than that of the
borrower.
   ``The bottom line is that even if there is a substantial easing
by the monetary authorities, it would not necessarily lead to a
turnaround in the economy.''
   With such matters weighing on stock prices, the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials dropped 84.65 points to 2,436.14 in the
past week.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.69 to 166.71;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
3.01 to 334.36, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was down 2.32 at 291.39.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 143.98 million shares a day,
against 180.28 million the week before.
   In the view of some analysts at least, a day of reckoning with
debt has been a long time coming, and its effects may not be easily
dispelled.
   Throughout most of the long expansion of the American economy
after World War II, say economists David A. Levy and S. Jay Levy in
Chappaqua, N.Y., memories of the Great Depression of the 1930s
served as a strong influence for prudence.
   But eventually, the maintain, ``prudence waned. Consumers'
qualms about incurring debt diminished.
   ``Speculators helped to bid up the prices of homes, other real
estate, works of art and even household objects deemed to be
`collectibles.' Conspicuous consumption was back.
   ``The waning of the prudence engendered by the Depression was
reflected in the unwise financing of assets whose utility was
questionable and whose prices were inflated.''
   The Levys conclude: ``The fallout from these excesses will
linger after the recession.''

<HEAD>No Quick Fixes on Oil, the Budget or Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For every worry about rising oil prices there's
a hope that the Persian Gulf crisis will be settled and things will
get quickly back to normal.
   Those hopes actually eroded some of the ``war premium'' on oil
early this past week, but getting back to normal won't be as easy
as knocking $5 or $10 off a $40 barrel of oil.
   Case in point: airlines.
   On Tuesday, Pan Am Corp. and UAL Corp. announced a $400 million
deal that would give UAL, parent of United Airlines, most of Pan
Am's valuable London routes. Within 48 hours another powerful
player, American Airlines, had emerged to say it wanted to bid on
the routes.
   Meanwhile, Continental Airlines was saying it had scrapped a
plan to seek bankruptcy court protection but was still searching
for ways to cut costs, including such measures as lightening planes
by removing the ashtrays.
   The wrenching changes and desperate cost cutting promised to
shift the balance of power in the industry dramatically - and more
than temporarily.
   The high cost of jet fuel since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 was
accelerating a Darwinian evolution already set in motion by
increased competition and sluggish demand for air travel, the
experts said.
   Robert J. Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association
of America, predicted ``some constriction'' and perhaps a ``total
restructuring'' of the industry, should jet fuel prices remain at
$1.25 per gallon or more, up from 60 cents before the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The industry association predicted that as the strong grew
stronger and the weak looked for ways to shrink back to
profitability, travelers would find fewer flights and higher fares.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Gulf Trickles Down to Home Sales</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Not all the trickle-down effects of the Persian Gulf crisis have
to do with oil prices.
   A real estate trade group said September sales of existing homes
were down 8 percent, partly because so many potential homebuyers
have been shipped to the Saudi desert for military duty.
   The South, where bases have dispatched big contingents, led the
sales decline with a 10 percent drop.

<HEAD>BUDGET: Does Agreement Mean Lower Rates?
   </HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After so much haggling, few were cheering the latest federal
budget agreement, which promised to cut the deficit by trimming
spending and raising taxes.
   Before the first compromise fell apart earlier this month,
expectations ran high that the Federal Reserve would answer the
budget agreement with easier credit terms.
   The Fed could still come through with lower rates, but the
spectacle of a president and Congress haplessly fumbling to reach
agreement over the last few weeks has sapped public confidence,
some experts said.
   If that drop in confidence restricts investment and consumer
spending, the short-term economic benefits of the budget agreement
could be severely limited.
   The new budget plan was a bit less stringent than its ill-fated
predecessor, but still called for higher income taxes on the rich
and stiffer excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol, cigarettes and
luxury items. It also would cut spending on Medicare.
   The fiscal restraint, once viewed as a cure-all for the
economy's ills, looked more like the first step on a long road to
recovery.

<HEAD>BANKERS: I'm OK, You're OK</HEAD>

   The nation's bankers convened in Orlando, Fla., in the shadow of
Disney World, to kibitz on their mounting financial problems. The
scene was the annual convention of the American Bankers'
Association, a traditional getaway for the men and women of
pinstripes.
   But even in the Magic Kingdom there was no escaping the
deepening recession in the financial industry, nor the growing
skepticism about the safety of banks and savings institutions.
   ABA President Richard A. Kirk, newly enthroned at the
convention, said the public's trust in banking was the key issue
facing the industry. Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke,
known for frankness, was more blunt, blaming bankers themselves for
precipitating a crisis of confidence.
   He faulted the industry for risky lending in real estate and
said banks ought to raise more capital to cover potential lending
losses and claims by depositors.

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Milken's Boss Testifies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The highlight of the week at the pre-sentencing hearing for
Michael Milken, who awaits his fate on six felony counts, was the
appearance of his former boss, Frederick Joseph.
   The silver-haired Joseph, former chief of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., said Milken may have violated some company policies and
misled him while cutting the deals examined at the hearing.
   The confrontation between ex-employer and employee intrigued
those who have tracked the long-running Milken saga, but featured
fewer dramatics than your average episode of ``L.A. Law.''
   Joseph's testimony, while hostile, was no more damaging to the
fallen financier than any of the other volleys discharged during
the course of the two-week hearing. Few could be described as much
more than glancing blows.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ordered the hearing to weigh the
government's claims that Milken deserved a harsh sentence because
he committed many more crimes than he admitted in his plea bargain.
The only ``verdict'' to be rendered will be the judge's sentence,
which can't exceed the maximum 28 years set by the plea agreement.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: The Bad News Continues</HEAD>

   The news was mostly bad on the corporate front. The earnings
picture, though not disastrous, was anything but pretty. Sears'
earnings were off 30 percent, Delta and USAir recorded losses,
UAL's profits were down 4 percent for the quarter.
   One of the bleakest reports was issued by Unisys, the struggling
technology firm, which announced a big loss and the resignation of
its chairman W. Michael Blumenthal.
   RJR Nabisco demonstrated that those accustomed to heavy debts
may carry them best. The company reported a net loss for the
quarter but said an increase in operating income was helping reduce
the mountain of debt piled up when the company was taken private in
a $25 billion buyout last year.
   Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, said it would cut 45,000
jobs or nearly 16 percent of its worldwide staff in an effort to
stem heavy losses. The cuts came on top of 10,000 previously
announced.

   Stock prices on Wall Street may be in a funk,
but the cost of a copy of the paper named after America's
best-known financial byway is going to jump 50 percent in December.
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Thursday it will raise the newsstand
price of The Wall Street Journal to 75 cents a copy from 50 cents
on Dec. 3, giving it the highest cover price for a leading national
daily newspaper.
   The move comes at a time when newspaper company profits are
slumping, but opinions were mixed on whether the Journal's move
would prompt other papers to risk circulation losses by hiking
prices.
   At USA Today, one of the Journal's chief competitors, Larry
Lindquist, senior vice president for circulation, said the paper
had no plans to raise its cover price of 50 cents in 1991.
   Dow Jones is also boosting the annual subscription price for the
Journal by 7.8 percent to $139 from $129, effective Jan. 2, 1991.
   It said the price hikes reflect higher transportation and other
publishing costs and rising newsprint and postage rates.
   Earlier this month, the company announced a 17.5 percent drop in
its third-quarter earnings, due in part to a decline in ad revenue.
It later disclosed a cost-cutting plan that included a freeze on
capital spending and total salaries, postponement of a new
magazine, and a reduction in the number of special reports in the
Journal.
   While several special-interest daily newspapers sell for more
than 50 cents a copy, the American Newspaper Publishers Association
said the Journal will be the first general-interest daily paper
with a newstand price of 75 cents.
   The newsstand price of the Journal has been 50 cents since April
1984, when it was raised from 40 cents a copy. Subscription rates
were last raised two years ago.
   The Journal has the largest daily circulation of any U.S.
newspaper, averaging nearly 1.86 million copies in the six months
ended Sept. 30.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones, said newsstand sales
account for under 300,000 in sales or less than 20 percent of the
total.
   He said newsstand sales fell slightly after the 1984 price hike
but circulation eventually recovered all lost ground.
   ``We can't predict what the impact of this increase will be but
the outlook for the long term is that we will gain back whatever we
lose,'' he said.
   Everette Dennis, executive director of the Gannett Center for
Media Studies at Columbia University, characterized the Journal as
a special case with a relatively affluent audience that could well
afford to pay the extra quarter for the daily paper.
   But others said the trend toward higher prices at the newsstand
was generally established. With a weak advertising market putting a
drag on newspaper revenues throughout the country, more increases
could be on the way.
   Joseph Lorfano of the Newspaper Publishers Association said the
average single copy price of newspapers has been rising steadily,
reaching 30 cents per copy on average last year, up from 25 cents
in 1987.
   May said 64 newspapers including the Journal have cover prices
of 50 cents a copy, up from only four at that figure in 1985.
   Dow Jones also said it was raising the newsstand price of
Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly to $2.50 a copy
from $2 effective with the Dec. 3 issue. The annual subscription
price will rise to $109 from $99 effective with the Jan. 7, 1991
issue.
   Barron's last raised it newsstand price in January 1989 and its
yearly rate in January 1990.

<HEAD>Final Government Witness Testifies at Hearing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The final government witnesses against Michael
Milken described a longtime secret securities ``parking'' scheme
with a big Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. customer but failed to link
him decisively to insider trading.
   Eight days of testimony concluded Thursday on charges levied by
the government to try to persuade a federal judge that the former
junk-bond financier deserves a long prison term.
   No further witnesses were expected to testify in the Manhattan
federal court hearing. Both sides were to present written
summations to U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood, who then would set a
sentencing date.
   Milken has pleaded guilty to six felony counts related to
illegal trading. He has agreed to pay $600 million in penalties and
faces up to 28 years in prison.
   On Thursday, former Drexel trader James Dahl testified that
Milken ordered him to buy Caesars World Inc. bonds at a time the
government claims Milken had inside information about the company.
   He also said Milken and the Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association
routinely engaged in secret securities ``parking'' arrangements
from before 1983 until 1986, which the government contends was
illegal. But Dahl said he knew of no similar arrangements with
other Drexel customers.
   Dahl further testified about a secret bathroom conversation with
Milken, drowned by a running faucet, after speculator Ivan Boesky's
1986 deal to cooperate with prosecutors. The government sought to
suggest Milken may have wanted Dahl to destroy evidence.
   The government alleges the charges it has raised in the
pre-sentencing hearing show Milken to be a pervasive lawbreaker.
The defense says he is innocent of the additional claims and that
his admitted crimes were aberrational.
   On the Caesars claim, the only charge of insider trading offered
of three alleged illegal transactions presented at the hearing,
Dahl said Milken in early July 1983 told him and other Drexel
salesmen to purchase as much of Caesars securities as possible.
   Milken had attended a meeting with Caesars and Drexel executives
on June 29 where the government claims the possibility of Drexel
managing a debt restructuring offer was discussed.
   Dahl testified that on July 8 he purchased $2 million in Caesars
bonds, then sold them to Columbia S&amp;L, so it appeared as though
Drexel no longer owned them. But Dahl said Columbia was actually
``parking'' the bonds, or holding them secretly for Drexel, which
can be illegal.
   Furthermore, Dahl testified, Drexel and Columbia had a
longstanding arrangement in which Columbia would secretly hold
securities for Drexel with an agreement to return them later. Asked
by prosecutors who initiated these transactions, Dahl said,
``Mike.''
   Drexel on July 15 announced it was advising Caesars on a debt
restructuring that sent the bonds soaring in value.
   Under cross-examination from Liman, Dahl said he did not know
whether Milken was aware Drexel had been negotiating to manage the
Caesars debt restructuring.
   Prescott Crocker, manager of a large high-yield bond fund that
agreed to sell Drexel $1.2 million in the Caesars bonds on July 14,
testified that after the restructuring was announced he accused
Dahl and Drexel of insider trading.
   Crocker said Milken denied any advance knowledge of the Caesars
debt restructuring, saying the deal was handled by Drexel's San
Francisco office, and that Milken offered to make up the gains from
the bonds in future trades.
   Dahl said Milken called him to Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif.,
high-yield bond department on Sunday, Nov. 16, 1986, two days after
Boesky's decision to cooperate in a probe of Wall Street
corruption. Boesky later became Milken's chief accuser.
   Dahl said Milken took him into the men's room, turned on a
faucet, washed his hands and said in hushed tones: ``There haven't
been any subpoenas issued. Whatever you need to do, do it.''
   Asked later what Milken meant, Dahl testified: ``I wasn't sure
what he was saying. `Do whatever you have to do.' What does that
mean? I didn't know.'' He also said Milken never ordered him to
destroy documents or not cooperate with investigators.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rebounded today against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo, while stock prices fell.
   The dollar closed at 128.50 yen, up 1.35 yen from 127.15 yen on
Thursday. After opening at 128.03 yen, it ranged between 128.00 yen
and 128.98 yen.
   The dollar fell 1.23 yen Thursday, after a four-day rally of
3.98 yen.
   ``The yen is weakened by recent polls that show declining
support for Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu,'' said Hiroshi Masuda,
deputy general manager of the Daiwa Securities Co.'s foreign
exchange section.
   But he noted the dollar has previously fallen as polls have
shown support for President Bush is also eroding. Uncertainties
about efforts to reduce the growth in the U.S. budget deficit are
also hurting the dollar, analysts said.
   Mahiko Nagai, a trader with Manufacturers Hanover Trust said,
``For the moment, market sentiment is neutral.''
   ``There's very little action because it's a battle between two
currencies that are both in bad shape,'' Masuda said.
   On the Tokyo stock exchange, where the strong dollar dampened
the market mood, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at
25,005.64 points, down 346.99 points or 1.37 percent from
Thursday's finish of 25,352.63 points.
   Reports suggesting war may break out in the Middle East sent
share prices tumbling, traders said.
   U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney warned that some 100,000
more American troops might be dispatched, while Iraq was reported
as now having 500,000 troops in southern Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   French President Francois Mitterrand was also reported as
indicating military action in the Gulf was imminent.
   Brokers said there was an early rush to sell as rising oil
prices fanned fears of inflation. The Japanese government's
consumer price data for the Tokyo area released today showed a 3.1
percent increase in October.
   The stock market had been slowly recovering from a slide that
began in January. The Nikkei index was off 48 percent for tthe year
through Oct. 1 when it closed at 20,221.86.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 84.31 points at 3 p.m. from
Thursday's 84.79-point finish. Their yields rose to 7.855 percent
from 7.745 percent.

of six labor negotiations between the Big Three automakers and
their unions in the United States and Canada.
   The final unresolved set of talks involve Chrysler Corp. and the
United Auto Workers union in the United States, but there are
promising signs.
   The UAW union has scheduled a meeting for next Thursday of its
Chrysler bargaining council. The session could be used to review
details of a tentative agreement, to inform local union leaders on
progress in talks or to set a strike date.
   Notices of the meeting of the 200-member council of local
presidents and bargaining committee chairs were mailed Thursday,
UAW spokesman Bob Barbee said.
   Word of the meeting came as the Canadian Auto Workers union and
Chrysler Canada, Chrysler's Canadian subsidiary, reached a
tentative agreement on a new contract covering about 10,000
workers. The agreement reached Thursday afternoon wraps up CAW
bargaining with Canadian subsidiaries of each of the Big Three
automakers.
   In the United States, the UAW has ratified new agreements with
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. The unresolved Chrysler
contract will cover about 63,000 U.S. hourly and salaried Chrysler
employees.
   The CAW and the UAW have pressed the Big Three and their
Canadian subsidiaries to bargain essentially two contracts - one in
Canada and one in the United States.
   ``The new three-year agreement with Chrysler Canada meets the
all-encompassing auto pattern set by the CAW at Ford of Canada and
subsequently met by GM of Canada,'' a CAW statement said Thursday.
   ``The decision by Chrysler Canada to meet the Canadian pattern
when it is indicating opposition to meeting the U.S. pattern is an
important turning point in the history of labor relations,'' the
statement said.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca and other company executives have
said the UAW pattern agreement is so expensive that Chrysler may
not be able to afford it. Chrysler has not asked for concessions
but said it needs special consideration from the union.
   The UAW has said there must be a pattern contract among the Big
Three automakers in the United States.
   Aside from lapel pins which say ``pattern or picket,'' there has
been little bargaining rhetoric since talks between the UAW and
Chrysler intensified earlier this week.
   Company and union officials said talks were continuing mostly in
meetings of subcommittees, which focus on specific areas of the
contract such as health care, time off and job security.
   The UAW-GM and UAW-Ford agreements call for three years of
income protection for workers laid off when plants shut down
because of slumping sales. They also provide for a 3 percent base
wage increase in the first year and 3 percent lump-sum payments in
the second and third years.
   GM attempts to clarify plant-shutdown language in a letter
attached to its contract with the UAW, for the first time promising
to consult with the union before shutting down a plant.
   The letter, obtained by the Detroit Free Press and published in
part today, said both sides would review options to closing before
the automaker took action.
   The pattern agreements have no changes in health care
provisions, a critical concern of Chrysler. The company said it
spent about $684 million on health-care benefits last year.
   In Canada, where a national health-care plan is in effect, there
is little concern about medical costs. The pattern agreement in
Canada provides for raises of 7.5 percent in the first year, 6.7
percent in the second and 4.8 percent in the third year of the
agreement.

<HEAD>MNC To Sell $1 Billion Credit Card Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MNC Financial Corp. plans to sell its
profitable $1 billion credit card operation, one of the country's
largest, in an attempt to shore up its faltering finances.
   MNC Financial, the parent company of Maryland National Bank, mde
the announcement Thursday as it reported a third-quarter loss of
$173 million, or $2.05 a share, because the bank holding company
put $350 million into its reserves for possible credit losses.
   David S. Penn, a bank analyst for Legg Mason Wood Walker, said
MNC is selling one of its best divisions ``so the company survives
no matter how bad things get.''
   He estimated that the bank will be able to get between $1.2
billion and $1.8 billion for the credit card operation.
   The $350 million loan loss provision increases the reserve for
credit losses to $791 million or 94 percent coverage of total
non-performing loans.
   With assets of $27 billion, MNC is the largest bank holding
company in Maryland. It is the parent company of Maryland National
Bank and American Security Bank in Washington.
   Because of the decision to sell MBNA America, the bank has
canceled an agreement with MNC chairman and chief executive Alfred
Lerner to buy up to $180 million of preferred stock. Lerner is the
company's largest stockholder, with 8.9 percent of the outstanding
shares.
   The company and its banking subsidiaries also have entered into
written agreements with the Federal Reserve Board and the office of
the comptroller of the currency, giving the regulators broad powers
in the running of the company.
   MNC said its total non-performing loans increased 40 percent
from $602 million June 30, to $844 million as of Sept. 30. Of that
total, $450 million of the non-performing loans are related to
commercial real estate.
   The increase in non-performing loans compares with a 45 percent
increase in the reserve for possible credit losses over the same
period; $297 million of the non-performing loans were either
contractually current or past due by fewer than 90 days as of Sept.
30.
   MNC had a net income of $68.8 million, or $1.13 per share,
during the 1989 third quarter.
   The third-quarter results increased MNC's nine-month loss to
$241.9 million, or $2.91 per share, compared with a net income of
$192.9 million, or $2.24 per share, for the same period a year ago.

   A nationwide congress of coal miners
put aside divisions today and adopted a plan by radical miners to
form the Soviet Union's first independent trade union.
   The new Independent Trade Union of Miners has a potential
membership of 2 million miners and could evolve into a potent new
political and economic force with power over energy supplies.
   The miners have been the most unified labor group in organizing
protests and strikes. Their walkout in 1989 threatened to leave
much of the country without fuel.
   The 900 delegates meeting in this industrial Ukrainian city
vowed today to push ahead with demands for workers' rights and
better living conditions.
   Delegates said they were prepared to strike again to enforce
their demands, but not until after the legislature of the Russian
republic, now in session in Moscow, has had time to act on their
complaints.
   ``The majority is for creating a new union, but there is a
minority that believes in the survival of the old (official)
union,'' said Konstantin Fesenko, a miner from Donetsk, the heart
of a major coal region 600 miles southwest of Moscow.
   The government-sponsored National Congress of Trade Unions voted
on Wednesday in Moscow to disband and form a voluntary association
of unions, but the miners said they weren't interested in joining.
   ``The old and new at some point may negotiate to come together,
but the current apparatchiks in the old union must go first,''
Fesenko said.
   Delegates today voted 525-11 with 40 abstentions to accept a
detailed plan for a new confederation of independent mine unions.
The plan was drawn up by radical miners based in Siberia's rich
coal fields who started the nationwide strike in 1989.
   A group of 130 radical miners, fed up with five days of debate,
held a separate meeting Thursday night to create a new union with
or without their colleagues' support.
   ``I was happy last night. Now I'm not so sure,'' said Vyacheslav
Golikov, leader of the Kuzbass Council of Workers' Committees,
which called the meeting.
   He said he was afraid the congress would water down their
principles for the new union, but added: ``I hope it will still be
a success.''
   Golikov has been dubbed the Lech Walesa of the Soviet Union for
his effort to create a workers' opposition movement.
   In addition to higher wages, the principles would guarantee job
security, give rights to workers to choose their own union leaders
and define who could belong to the union.
   The new wage figure has not been specified, but officials have
said the miners should receive twice the average Soviet salary.
Under Soviet economic reforms now under way, controls on wages will
be lifted.
   The plan calls for regular miners' congresses and the creation
of a representative council and an executive body to coordinate the
new union's actions.
   The new union would be a confederation, allowing scores of
smaller unions to maintain their independence within an umbrella
organization.
   When news of the radical miners' decision reached the congress
this morning, many delegates angrily denounced congress organizers
and demanded to join the new union.
   After a heated debate, the congress sent negotiators to talk
with the new union. They agreed to create a temporary organizing
committee to prepare the first congress of the independent union.
No date was set.
   The 1989 miners' strikes began with demands for better working
and living conditions but quickly escalated to include demands for
regional economic autonomy for the main mining regions.
   The government persuaded the miners to return to work by
promising to meet most of their demands. But most of the promises
remain unfulfilled, an issue that has spurred new strikes.
   The miners have also sought regional control so the mines can
form self-managed local and regional associations that can sell
coal to the highest bidder.

<HEAD>Diamond-Star to Get Another Car for Chrysler and Mitsubishi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new two-door coupe will be among a new line of
cars made at the joint-venture assembly plant in Illinois owned by
Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
   The decision announced Thursday deepens the relationship between
the two companies. Chrysler owns 12.1 percent of the Japanese
company Mitsubishi.
   The two companies issued a joint statement Thursday announcing
the new generation of cars to be split evenly between them.
Chrysler currently gets about 55 percent of the cars made at the
plant in Normal, Ill.
   Neither company would say when the plant would begin making the
cars or give the details of the new cars - a three-door sports car
and a four-door sedan in addition to the new two-door coupe, said a
Chrysler official speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   Diamond-Star makes the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Mirage, the
Plymouth Laser and the Eagle Talon and Summit. The Eclipse, Laser
and Talon are two-door sports cars and the Mirage and Summit are
four-door sedans.
   Chrysler officials have said the company was talking with
Mitsubishi about building a new vehicle to replace the Dodge Omni
and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars that Chrysler, the third
biggest U.S. automaker, axed in February.
   However, the Chrysler official said the new car for the
Diamond-Star plant would not be an Omni-Horizon replacement.
   The official also said the new cars will use more domestic parts
than the current Diamond-Star cars, which contain about 60 percent
U.S. parts. The increase will come from more use of Chrysler
engines and transmissions, a joint statement from the two companies
said.
   The two companies each own 50 percent of Diamond-Star.
   The first Diamond-Star cars, the Eclipse and Laser, began
rolling off the assembly line Sept. 1, 1988. The Talon was added
next and the Summit and Mirage came later.
   In addition to Diamond-Star, Chrysler and Mitsubishi are linked
through the Dodge and Plymouth Colt line of small cars made by
Mitsubishi. The Dodge Stealth, a new car for the 1991 model year,
also is designed and built by Mitsubishi with the exception of the
outer body panels, which Chrysler designed.

   The stock market declined broadly today as the
price of oil continued its recent rise.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.61 to
2,469.55 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 167 up, 630
down and 381 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.35 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery rose about 80 cents
a barrel, to just above $35 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The buying came amid intensifying speculation that the showdown
in the Persian Gulf might be moving closer to open conflict.
   Analysts said that gave little encouragement to investors
already worried about the shaky state of the domestic economy.
   Sharply higher costs for gasoline, heating oil and a wide range
of other goods are expected to act as a drag on consumer spending
and business investment at a time when the economy is already
burdened with debt problems and a battered real estate market.
   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty dropped | to 30&lsqb; in active trading. The
company reported lower third-quarter earnings and announced plans
for an overhaul of its operations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.99 to 168.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .40 at 292.38.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.05 to

   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the

   An administration energy expert says consumers
can expect the price of gasoline to hover between $1.30 and $1.62 a
gallon over the next year, provided that no war breaks out in the
Persian Gulf.
   U.S. Energy Information Administrator Calvin Kent also told a
Senate panel Thursday to expect home heating oil prices to range
between $1.13 and $1.45 per gallon through 1991, roughly equal to
the high levels heating oil reached in last winter's cold snap.
   Kent's forecast came in the opening session of a three-day
hearing on why retail gasoline and heating oil prices shoot up on
the slightest rumor of trouble in the Mideast but don't seem to
fall when rumors of peace send crude oil prices tumbling.
   Kent told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that an
improvement in the Mideast situation might lower the price of crude
oil, but an immediate response at the gasoline pump shouldn't be
expected.
   ``Prices go up more quickly than they come down,'' Kent said.
   Kent's price estimates assume that the Persian Gulf crisis does
not dissolve into war, that the winter is normal in severity and
that market factors such as inventories and daily oil production
remain relatively stable.
   Also assumed in his forecast was that crude oil remains at about
$30 per barrel. That assumption seemed open to question even as he
testified; on the New York Mercantile Exchange oil jumped $3.17 to
$34.25 per barrel for December contracts on Thursday.
   Oil was rising again in early trading today.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese securities
firm is talking to the Resolution Trust Corp. about acquiring $1
billion in commercial loans of failed savings and loans, a
published report said today.
   The Wall Street Journal reported that officals of Nomura
Securities Co. division met Wednesday with the RTC's Lamar Kelly,
who is in charge of selling assets the government agency assumes
from failed thrifts.
   The proposed transaction would betthe RTC's largest and one of
the first with a Japanese investor. The deal wouldn't close until
February at the earliest, the Journal reported.
   The Journal story said a source it did not identify by name said
Nomura asked about acquiring the loans from a variety of failed
thrifts that have not yet been packaged.
   Nomura in May repackaged $1 billion worth of loans from U.S.
banks, including Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., and sold them
through a new Dutch company. The loans were purchased primarily by
institutional investors in the United States, Britain and Japan.
   The RTC's only major transaction with a Japanese firm was
earlier this year when it retained a subsidiary of Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd. to help sell its junk bond portfolio.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending Thursday's losses.
   A weekly government report showed little improvement in export
sales of U.S. grain last week, and expectations for a large Soviet
purchase of U.S. corn have faded, analysts said.
   Meanwhile, weather conditions remain ideal for seeding winter
wheat in the central and southern Plains and for corn and soybean
harvesting in the Midwest.
   Gerald Zusel, a vice president in the grain-trading division of
E.D.&amp; F. Man International Futures Inc., said the soybean harvest
could be finished within a week, leaving farmers to concentrate on
getting in the rest of the corn.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1\ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.62{ a bushel; corn
was 1 cent to 1} cents lower with December at $2.29\ a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 1\ cents lower with December at $1.22} a bushel; and
soybeans were 1\ cents to 3 cents lower with November at $6.03 a

   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed and pork futures were mostly
lower in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .10 cent higher with December
at 77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .15

unchanged to .20 cent lower with December at 53.62 cents a pound;
and frozen pork bellies were unchanged to 1.03 cents lower with
February at 63.82 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures advanced Thursday; pork futures were mixed.

<HEAD>SEC Wants Investors To Know High-Yield Means High-Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These are times when the complex world of high
finance is stumping even the highly financed.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission wants junk bond mutual
funds, which are targeted at individuals rather than big
insitutional investors, to explain that high yield means high risk.
   With many junk bond yields passing 20 percent, mutual funds that
invest in the bonds are also touting high returns.
   As the market gets pessimistic about the likelihood of junk bond
investments paying off, the price gets beaten down. The lower price
means even higher and more enticing yields.
   The SEC is afraid bond fund investors are making decisions by
comparing the high yields to the interest rates offered on
investments at their local bank, money market funds and bond funds
that invest in higher quality debt.
   The average annual yield on high-yield funds tracked by Lipper
Analytical Securities Corp. has risen from 12.9 percent last
September to 15.4 percent this September.
   ``The significantly higher yields do not reflect the income
stream investors can expect but rather the risk that their
investment may lose a substantial portion of its value in a
financial restructuring or default,'' Gene Gohlke, the SEC's acting
director of the Division of Investment Management, said in a letter
to the funds last week.
   While the yields have soared, the plunging prices made the
average junk bond fund lose 11.2 percent in the year that ended
Sept. 30, said Lipper, a mutual fund research firm.
   The SEC said high-yield funds should consider hiring telephone
operators who can explain the risk to shareholders, pressure
brokers to be forthcoming with investors and exclude yield
quotations from advertisements or add information explaining the
risk.
   Bond funds say they're thinking about it.
   While some funds already have changed their prospectuses to
detail the high risk inherent to high-yield bond investing, the SEC
suggestions go beyond these complicated and often hard-to-read
explanatory documents.
   ``The focus is on sales practices rather than adding another
lengthyddisclosure requirement to the prospectus. I think that's
good to focus on the marketing of funds,'' said Stanley Griffith,
associate general counsel at Boston-based Fidelity Investments.
   ``If you're going to put a big yield number up there then you've
probably got an obligation to go further,'' he said.
   Griffith said Fidelity recently had begun showing the lower
coupon rate, rather than the yield to maturity, in advertisements
for its Fidelity High Income Fund.
   At Oppenheimer Management Corp., Paul Suckow, director of fixed
income investing, said the firm has changed its prospectus and
asked brokers to explain high-yield risk.
   ``I think today, however, with prices substantially lower than
where they were a few years ago, the risks are less,'' he said.
   ``People should now be looking at this and saying with the
prices so much lower, the risks are less than existed a couple
years ago when prices were so much higher,'' Suckow said.

<HEAD>Oil Keeps Rising on War Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices moved up about $1 per barrel on the
futures market this morning, as traders kept betting on war in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``It's definitely just the increased war fears and seeing the
war premium getting put back inthe market,'' said Ann-Louise
Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil, the key grade, was up 95 cents to $35.20
per barrel for December delivery contracts on the New York
Mercantile Exchange late this morning. Contracts for delivery in
later months were all trading higher as crude moved up sharply for
a third straight trading session.
   Oil regained all of the ground it lost in Monday's record tumble
of $5.41 per barrel. But trading was erratic, and speculators were
left uncertain on oil's future direction.
   ``It's a market that has gotten increasingly emotional and is
very much reacting to the situation in the Middle East,'' Hittle
said.
   Recently, big jumps in oil prices, both up and down, have seem
to come with greater frequency as the market has appeared to become
even more volatile, analysts say.
   ``There is some sense from previous reports that time is running
out on the situation,'' said William Byers, an analyst with Bear
Stearns &amp; Co. ``Whether that's a correct perception, I don't
know.''
   Byers said many traders believe any attack on Iraqi forces might
occur either just before or just after the U.S. elections, now less
than two weeks away.
   Traders had been expecting even sharper rises today after the
London oil futures prices jumped dramatically. But before the New
York market opened, a French television report of a conciliatory
letter from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to French President
Francois Mitterrand had a calming effect.
   Refined petroleum products were on the rise along with crude
oil.
   Unleaded gasoline futures were up 2.45 cents to 96.05 cents per
gallon on November contracts. Contracts for delivery in later
months were all trading higher.
   Home heating oil was up 2.23 cents to 93.90 cents per gallon for
November delivery. Later delivery months were all higher.
   Natural gas futures showed little change, with December delivery
contracts falling 1.6 cents to $2.43 per 1,000 cubic feet. Later
delivery months were mixed.

   Daily News managers published and tried to
distribute a newspaper today using non-union replacement drivers
who ran a gantlet of protesters throwing rocks and bottles.
   Police reported at least two minor injuries and at least 11
arrests, including two men held after a delivery truck was
firebombed.
   Copies of today's paper, reduced to only one edition, were
trucked out of the printing plants about three hours late, under
police escort.
   It was not immediately known how many were printed and
delivered, but the News was absent from some midtown Manhattan and
suburban railroad station newsstands during rush hour.
   A half-dozen pickets marched outside the News headquarters this
morning, and union leaders stood outside to direct workers to go
home.
   The strike called Thursday night at the nation's second-largest
metropolitan daily newspaper capped a 10-month dispute over
management's efforts to gain more control over money-losing
operations.
   Police in riot gear escorted delivery trucks out of a Daily News
printing plant in Kearny, N.J., through hundreds of strikers and
their supporters hurling bricks, stones, eggs and bottles. Vehicle
windows were covered with protective tape to prevent any shattered
glass from injuring those inside.
   One truck was firebombed in neighboring Harrison, N.J., Kearny
police Capt. Anthony Gouveia said. No injuries were reported. Two
men were arrested shortly afterward in Kearny on charges of
possession of three Molotov cocktails, Lt. Micheal Davitt said.
   Another man was arrested for allegedly throwing rocks at a truck
at the Kearny plant, Gouveia said.
   ``He was the only one we could catch,'' Gouveia said. ``It was
ugly out there.''
   Delivery trucks also rolled past hundreds of jeering protesters
outside News plants in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and in
Garden City on Long Island.
   Strikers broke the windows of a News truck in Brooklyn, and the
driver was taken to a hospital for treatment of facial injuries,
said police spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   She said other strikers pelted a News truck in Manhattan,
causing the driver to lose control and hit two parked cars. A
security guard inside the truck sustained minor injuries in a
scuffle with two strikers, she said.
   Six people were arrested, mostly on charges of disorderly
conduct, outside the Lon Island plant, Garden City police Lt.
William Fitzpatrick said.
   Two were arrested outside the Brooklyn plant, where a
fireworks-style explosive was ignited beneath a truck, police said.
   Eight unions with about 1,800 members went on strike and the
Newspaper Guild said its 800 members would honor picket lines,
including one at the main News offices in Manhattan.
   Management crews produced today's edition. Its lead headline
concerned a police crackdown on drug dealing near city schools, but
a smaller headline beneath it said ``UNIONS STRIKE NEWS'' and had a
picture of a News delivery truck burned after a dispute Thursday
that triggered the strike.
   On Thursday, a union official was ejected from the Brooklyn
plant while defending an employee's right to work while seated. The
newspaper said workers then walked off the job. Union leaders say
they were locked out.
   Sixty drivers with the most seniority then were fired and
replaced by non-union workers. Fires were started and trucks were
sabotaged.
   A ``To Our Readers'' box on page 3 said that because of
Thursday's dispute, only 920,000 copies of Thursday's issue were
distributed. The News has a normal weekday circulation of 1.18
million.
   ``The Daily News intends full publication and distribution of
its Friday issue,'' the box continued.
   The News' normal weekday circulation is second only to the Los
Angeles Times among metropolitan dailies. The nationally
distributed Wall Street Journal and USA TODAY also have larger
circulations than the News.
   Contracts for all 10 of the newspaper's unions ran out in March,
and negotiations have stalemated.
   ``It is indeed unfortunate that a strike was provoked by these
unions against the Daily News at a time when we were involved in
the collective bargaining process to resolve our differences,''
said John Sloan, Daily News vice president for labor relations.
   He said replacement workers from other Tribune Co. papers in
Orlando, Fla., and Chicago were being flown to New York.
   Over the past decade the News has lost about $115 million and
daily circulation has dropped by about 700,000. The paper's
managers say they need to end alleged labor abuses and save $50
million to $70 million annually.
   The unions said the paper is trying to break them and called for
an advertisers' boycott.
   In a bar near the Brooklyn plant, workers said they had been
expecting a showdown with management for weeks.
   ``The Daily News thinks they can put out a scab paper and they
think New Yorkers will buy it,'' said a veteran driver who would
not give his name. ``We can only hope and pray that New Yorkers
don't.''
   The paper is embroiled in one of the nation's fiercest newspaper
wars. Analysts have questioned whether the city can support three
tabloids and the broadsheet New York Times.
   The other two tabloids planned to increase their press runs
today. The New York Post, which normally prints about 625,000
copies, expected a press run of 850,000 to 860,000. New York
Newsday was expected to increase its press run from about 250,000
to about 400,000.

   Egypt raised its oil export prices by a $6 a
barrel on Friday, reflecting uncertainty over peace prospects in
the Persian Gulf.
   The rise followed two consecutive cuts last week totalling $6
per barrel.
   The new prices are $32.30 a barrel for the top-quality Khalig

suez; $31.15 a barrel for Belayim; $30 a barrel for Ras Badran; and

   Egypt is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting

   Higher oil prices pushed the European
Community's average annual inflation rate in September to 6.1
percent, the highest level more than five years, the EC statistics
agency Eurostat said Friday.
   The EC rate for September, up from 5.9 percent in August,
compared with 6.2 percent in the United States and 2.9 percent in
Japan, Eurostat reported.
   It said it was the highest annual inflation rate since July
1985.
   The surge in oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
August pushed up consumer prices by an average 0.7 percent in the
EC in September, the agency said.
   Eurostat reported these annul inflation rates for the EC states
in September: Belgium, 3.7 percent; Denmark, 3.0 percent; Germany,
3.0 percent; Greece, 21.8 percent; Spain, 6.5 percent; France, 3.8
percent; Italy, 6.8 percent; Luxembourg, 3.7 percent; Netherlands,
2.6 percent; Portugal, 13.7 percent, and Britain, 10.9 percent.
   Eurostat published no figures for Ireland which calculates it
inflation rates quarterly.

   The stock market remained on the defensive today
as the price of oil continued its recent rise.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 16.09 points to
2,468.07 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 343 up, 962
down and 468 unchanged.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery rose about 70 cents
a barrel, to just under $35 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The buying came amid intensifying speculation that the showdown
in the Persian Gulf might be moving closer to open conflict.
   Analysts said that gave little encouragement to investors
already worried about the shaky state of the domestic economy.
   Sharply higher costs for gasoline, heating oil and a wide range
of other goods are expected to act as a drag on consumer spending
and business investment at a time when the economy is already
burdened with debt problems and a battered real estate market.

   The Treasury Department on Friday sold $10.13
billion in 52-week bills at the lowest interest rates in more than
two years and rescheduled for next Tuesday a $12 billion auction of
2-year notes.
   Both offerings had been postponed because of congressional
failure to raise the debt limit after it fell from $3.195 trillion
to $3.12 trillion on Oct. 20. But President Bush signed legislation
on Thursday raising the ceiling to $3.195 trillion through Saturday
which permitted Friday's auction.
   The budget package that Congress hopes to pass this weekend
would raise the limit to $4.072 trillion and the Treasury said the
2-year note auction is contingent upon enactment before Tuesday.
   The average discount rate at Friday's bill auction was 7.01
percent, down from 7.25 percent at the last auction on Sept. 20.
   It was the lowest rate since 52-week bills averaged 6.74 percent
on May 5, 1988.
   The bills will carry an equivalent coupon interest rate of 7.51
percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,293.20.
   Sales totaled $10.13 billion out of bids of $47.13 billion.

<TEXT>
   The former owner of a failed Dallas savings and
loan who has been accused in a criminal indictment of diverting
funds to keep the thrift afloat was released on a personal
recognizance bond today.
   Jarrett E. Woods Jr., former owner of Western Savings
Association, agreed in federal court today to surrender his
passport and limit his travel to the continental United States.
   Woods was accused Thursday in the indictment of illegally
diverting $18 million to pay off delinquent loans as a way of
postponing the highflying thrift's $1 billion collapse.
   Prosecutors did not oppose the personal recognizance bond in an
8-minute initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Jane Jackson.
Woods' next court appearance is scheduled for Nov. 1.
   Woods, who was described by the U.S. attorney general as one of
the industry's biggest ``bandits'' in Texas, had no comment upon
leaving the hearing.
   His attorney, Shirley Lobel, said she could not comment because
of a gag order.
   The 37-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in
Dallas charges Woods with bank fraud, misapplication of bank funds,
making false ledger entries and conspiracy.
   ``We have corralled one of the biggest savings and loan bandits
in Texas,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told reporters
Thursday. ``The freewheeling lifestyle and fraudulent management
practices that led to Western's collapse helped set the trend for
our national thrift crisis.''
   Thecharges carry a maximum sentence of 185 years in prison and
fines totaling at least $8.2 million or twice the loss proven by
prosecutors.
   Western's failure in 1986 when it was taken over by federal
regulators cost the taxpayers $1 billion, the Justice Department
said. A civil suit filed earlier this week by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. seeks to collect $560 million from Woods. It
accuses Woods of spending $7 million of depositors' money in the
months before Western failed.
   The thrift, which Woods purchased in 1982 with $2 million in
borrowed money, grew from $70 million in assets to $2 billion four
years later, said U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins.
   Collins said the case ``can be fairly characterized as an
example of a real estate developer, Jarrett Woods, buying up a
sleepy little S&amp;L, moving it to Dallas, pumping it full of
high-cost brokered funds and then lending the money out on
high-risk loans.
   ``The indictment shows the great lengths that people will go to
deceive regulators,'' Collins said.
   The indictment charges that Woods diverted $16 million from a
$60 million loan for a Houston real estate deal to businessman
James Reagin, a major borrower who was behind on loan payments to
Western.
   Most of the money, plus $2.26 million that was diverted from the
sale of Western property, was used to help Reagin pay off loans so
that Western would not have to write them off as bad debts.
   At one point, Reagin was behind on loans worth $64 million,
Collins said.
   ``Just the loans to James Reagin would have likely caused the
failure of Western Savings Association,'' Collins said.
   Reagin, a Houston businessman who faces sentencing in connection
with the failure of the Glen Ellyn Savings and Loan in Illinois, is
cooperating with prosecutors in their investigation of Woods,
officials said.
   Woods is not accused of pocketing any of the funds diverted to
Reagin. But Collins said Woods, as 100 percent owner of Western,
was motivated by a desire to keep regulators from taking over the
S&amp;L.
   The indictment also charges that Woods arranged for a Western
subsidiary to pay a $48,000 commission to a company that had not
earned the money. The indictment alleges the money was actually
used to pay off a gambling debt Woods owed.
   ``There is nothing you can do basically in the short run to
address these cases quickly,'' Collins said of the department's
four-year effort to get Woods. ``You must have a long, large
concerted effort.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrator called in to rescue debt-ridden
Polly Peck International PLC said Friday he was optimistic the
British food and electronics conglomerate will survive.
   Richard Stone, an accountant, said he believed there was plenty
of opportunity to restructure the company, though he admitted it
could end up ``somewhat different'' than its present form.
   The administrators are expected to sell off Polly Peck assets to
reduce the company's debt, but it's not known how many assets or
which ones. Polly Peck owns such diverse brands as Del Monte fruit
and Sansui stereos.
   Meanwhile, British Trade Secretary Peter Lilley called for
information on Polly Peck to see whether a full government inquiry
into the company's affairs should be undertaken.
   Polly Peck Chairman Asil Nadir earlier had unsuccessfully sought
such an inquiry.
   Polly Peck asked a court Thursday to appoint administrators to
keep creditors at bay and help sort out its debt load of 1.3
billion pounds, about $2.5 billion.
   The problems have been developing since the company suspended
trading in its stock after the share price plummeted 55 percent on
Sept. 20 on news that the Serious Fraud Office had raided the
offices of South Audley Management Ltd.
   The fraud office is investigating allegations of possible
misconduct. South Audley is an investment company linked with a
Nadir family trust.
   Nadir and the company have denied any knowledge of wrongdoing.
   On Friday, the Department of Trade and Industry issued a
statement saying Lilley ``will look at all the information
available to him arising from the move into administration of Polly
Peck and the events leading up to it.''
   ``In particular he will want to hear from the administrator at
the earliest opportunity whether the administrator thinks there are
any matters that need investigating,'' the statement said.

   The House passed legislation today to protect
employees of banking agencies who expose cases of abuse in the
government's effort to clean up the savings and loan industry.
   The proposal by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., was part of a money
laundering bill passed by voice vote in the waning hours of the
1990 congressional session.
   Employees of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the
now-defunct Federal Home Loan Bank Board and other banking agencies
were not covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The
Annunzio would extend that protection to them, retroactive to Jan.
1, 1987.
   S&amp;L regulators, currently unprotected by federal whistleblower
laws, are like police officers who can't make any arrests, Rep.
Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., told a hearing Thursday. The lack of
protection for thrift regulators who point out cases of abuse harms
the government's S&amp;L cleanup effort, Schumer said.
   ``Imagine putting a cop on the corner, taking away his gun,
badge and nightstick, and telling him that he'd be fired if he
tried to make any arrests,'' he said. ``That's about what we've
done with our S&amp;L regulators.''
   Also on Thursday, federal regulators approved a plan to sell or
close about 192 failed savings and loans over the next six months.
The Resolution Trust Corp. oversight board approved the plan, which
involves assets valued at $119 billion.
   The proposal must be approved through the congressional
appropriations process.
   Schumer spoke at a hearing of the House Budget Committee's Task
Force on Urgent Fiscal Issues, which he chairs. Two S&amp;L agency
employees who were fired testified at the hearing.
   John M. Geddes, a former employee of the now-defunct Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., was fired in August 1989. He had
told the agency about serious errors he found in the
adjustable-rate mortgage portfolio of American Federal Savings &amp;
Loan of Anderson, Ind.
   Geddes said errors involving adjustable-rate mortgages, which he
discovered at various S&amp;Ls around the country, could mean $8
billion to $15 billion in liability for the lending industry and
the government. In some cases, he said, borrowers have been
overcharged by almost $10,000 on loan balances of $25,000.
   Several law firms consulted by Geddes had warned the FSLIC that
its failure to correct the errors could expose the agency to
allegations of fraud.
   ``I was not the only employee who was informed not to rock the
boat,'' Geddes said. ``Other employees were passed over for
advancement or given the worst jobs until they could not take it
any more and resigned.''
   In June, the FDIC ordered an investigation into overcharges on
adjustable-rate mortgages.
   The other whistleblower, Lisa R. Walleri, was an examiner for
the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle. She testified that she was
fired for refusing to sign a report on Far West Federal Bank that
distorted its financial condition to make it look more healthy than
it was.
   John F. Downey, an official of the Office of Thrift Supervision,
said his agency agreed with Ms. Walleri that the Seattle FHLB's
report on Far West was inaccurate. He said the OTS found ``various
deficiencies'' in the Seattle agency, including failure to comply
with policies and procedures, and inadequate guidance and
oversight.
   ``She deserves an apology,'' Downey said of Ms. Walleri. He
added that the OTS would consider offering her a job.
   The Whistleblowers Protection Act shields federal employees who
disclose governmental wrongdoing against reprisal. Lawmakers who
drafted last year's S&amp;L bailout legislation say they
unintentionally neglected to provide such protection for banking
agency workers.

   The stock market lapsed into a steady decline
today as the price of oil continued its recent rise.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 35.40 points to
2,448.76 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 358 up,
1,127 down and 438 unchanged.
   The price of crude oil for December delivery rose about 70 cents
a barrel, to just under $35 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The buying came amid intensifying speculation that the showdown
in the Persian Gulf might be moving closer to open conflict.
   Analysts said that gave little encouragement to investors
already worried about the shaky state of the domestic economy.
   Sharply higher costs for gasoline, heating oil and a wide range
of other goods are expected to act as a drag on consumer spending
and business investment at a time when the economy is already
burdened with debt problems and a battered real estate market.
   Manufacturers Hanover fell 2} to 17\ after remarks by a company
official that were interpreted as raising the possibility of a
dividend reduction.
   Among other prominent banking issues, Citicorp dropped &rsqb; to 11\;
Chase Manhattan &rsqb; to 10~, and Security Pacific 1\ to 19.
   Unisys led the active list, down 1&lsqb; at 2\. On Thursday the

said it might be in the red for the fourth quarter as well.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.06 to 167.45. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.79 at 290.99.

   Three former Northwest Airlines pilots
convicted of flying a passenger plane while intoxicated were
sentenced to prison today, two for a year and the other to 16
months.
   U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum also imposed three years'
probation on each, telling them: ``Gentlemen, you are good men who
have done a bad thing.''
   The judge said the pilots' actions amounted to a breach of faith
between the traveling public and the pilots.
   ``It is a crime against our sense of security. In that sense,
all of us are a victim of this crime,'' he said.
   The sentences were within federal guidelines, which recommended
12 to 18 months; the maximum would have been 15 years. Rosenbaum
left open the possibility that they could remain free pending their
appeals.
   The defendants - Capt. Norman Lyle Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.;
1st Officer Robert Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch, Colo.; and
flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 35, of Antioch, Tenn. - were
convicted of flying while intoxicated on a hop from Fargo, N.D., to
Minneapolis the morning of March 8.
   At the sentencing hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de
la Vega asked for a ``substantial'' sentence while the pilots'
lawyers argued for lenient treatment.
   As he announced his decision, Rosenbaum said he was particularly
disturbed that all three pilots had been under the influence. ``Who
can comprehend an entire crew alcohol-impaired?'' he asked.
   Prouse, who had the highest blood-alcohol concentration in a
test given two hours after the flight landed, was the one who
received the 16-month sentence. The judge told him that his
acknowledged alcoholism was not ``a license to kill.''
   In the tests after the flight was completed, Prouse had a
blood-alcohol concentration of 0.13 percent, Kirchner's was 0.06
percent and Balzer's was 0.08 percent.
   At the trial, the pilots had argued that the fact that the
40-minute flight, which had 91 passengers, was uneventful showed
that they were not rendered incapable of flying by the alcohol they
had drunk the night before.
   They were the first pilots to be convicted under a 1986 law
aimed at cracking down on substance abuse in the transportation
industry.
   Prouse admitted to drinking more than 15 rum and colas at a
lounge the night before the flight. A waitress testified that
Prouse fell as he left the bar at about 11:30 p.m. and returned to
get directions to his hotel, which was about three blocks away.
   Balzer and Kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer and
left the bar about an hour before Prouse, according to testimony.
   The plane left at 6:30 the next morning, and the crew members
were arrested after they arrived at Minneapolis-St. Paul.
   Northwest fired the pilots after the incident for drinking
within 12 hours of a scheduled flight, and the Federal Aviation
Administration revoked their pilots licenses.

<TEXT>
   Former Western Savings Association owner Jarrett
E. Woods Jr., accused of illegally diverting $18 million in funds
from the thrift, was released on a personal recognizance bond
Friday pending arraignment next month.
   Woods is expected to enter a plea to a 37-count indictment on
Nov. 1. He is charged with illegally diverting thrift funds to pay
off delinquent loans as a way of postponing the high-flying
thrift's $1 billion collapse.
   Prosecutors did not oppose his release on personal recognizance
during an 8-minute initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Jane
Jackson.
   Woods had no comment upon leaving the hearing. His attorney,
Shirley Lobel, said she could not comment because of a gag order
issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney.
   The indictment returned Thursday by a Dallas federal grand jury
charges Woods with bank fraud, misapplication of bank funds, making
false ledger entries and conspiracy.
   Western's failure in 1986 when it was taken over by federal
regulators cost the taxpayers $1 billion, the Justice Department
said.
   The charges carry a maximum sentence of 185 years in prison and
fines totaling at least $8.2 million or twice the loss proven by
prosecutors.
   A civil lawsuit filed earlier this week by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. seeks to collect $560 million from Woods. It
accuses him of spending $7 million of depositors' money in the
months before Western failed.

   Soybean futures prices tumbled below $6 a bushel
Friday to a 2{-month low on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late
sell-off ahead of the biggest harvest weekend of the year.
   Corn, wheat and oat futures also closed mostly lower.
   Soybeans opened lower amid speculation that the soybean harvest
will move rapidly toward completion this weekend in the Midwest.
   Selling by speculative funds snowballed when the price for
November soybean deliveries slipped below $6 bushel about 45
minutes before the close, said Gerald Zusel, a vice president in
the grain-trading division of E.D.&amp; F. Man International Futures

   ``We had a technical breakdown,'' he said. ``There was big, big
fund selling in there today.''
   He said the soybean harvest could be finished within a week,
leaving farmers to cocentrate on getting in the rest of the corn.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2\ cents lower to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.62\ a bushel; corn
was 2 cents to 2} cents lower with December at $2.28 a bushel; oats

<HEAD>Aetna Announces Layoffs, Earnings Drop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aetna Life and Casualty Co. on Friday announced
a restructuring plan, including layoffs, to tighten operations and
save hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The Hartford-based insurance company also announced a 51 percent
drop in third-quarter earnings that included a one-time, $60
million charge for severance benefits and other costs associated
with the reorganization.
   Analysts said the restructuring may be good medicine not only to
Aetna but the ailing insurance industry, which has been suffering
from soft premiums and poor returns in its real estate and bond
investments.
   Aetna's announcement ``might set the tone for the insurance
industry in general,'' said Denise A. Petsis, an analyst with Argus
Research Corp. ``The insurance industry is in a down cycle. ...
There's very little room right now to improve revenue, so what
they're trying to do is hold the line on costs.
   ``When the insurance industry rebounds, I think a lot of these
companies, Aetna included, will be in a much better position,''
Petsis said.
   Aetna, one of the nation's top five insurance companies, said it
would save up to $95 million a year by reorganizing its three
domestic insurance divisions into two groups. In the process, 2,600
jobs will be eliminated through layoffs and attrition.
   ``Our goal is to build on the many areas of excellence Aetna
must retain, and to solidify our position as a leader in insurance,
related financial services and managed health care,'' said James T.
Lynn, Aetna chairman.
   Aetna's competitors are also retrenching. Travelers Corp., also
based in Hartford, recently cut its dividend to save $100 million
and said it will become choosier about where it sells coverage.
Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is consolidating its domestic
property and casualty operations to pull in any loose ends.
   The `90s will be the era ``where focus will count,'' said
Michael Frinquelli, an insurance analyst with Salomon Bros.
   ``I don't think we will necessarily wind up a decade from now
with fewer companies in the business. We will end up with same
number - smaller and more focused,'' he said.
   Aetna said it earned $88.6 million, or 80 cents per share, in
the three months ended Sept. 30 compared to earnings of $183
million, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue slipped 1.2 percent to $4.84 billion in the quarter from
$4.90 billion for the same period last year. Premiums rose
slightly, to $3.3 billion from $3.2 billion last year.
   Under the reorganization, to be put in place March 4, two new
groups will be created. One will include managed health care, group
insurance, small business employee benefits markets, pension and
financial services, individual annuity and pension and sponsored
sales.
   The other will be made up of commercial markets, national
commercial accounts, bond, personal auto, homeowners and individual
life insurance.
   ``All our existing businesses remain, it's just a matter of how
they will be grouped and how they will be funded,'' said company
spokesman John C. Hawkins.
   Aetna said most of the job eliminations would come from its
three offices in the Hartford area. About 17,400 of its 45,200
employees work in Hartford, Middletown and Windsor, Conn.
   He said it was too early to tell how many of the jobs would be
lost through layoffs.
   The third-quarter earnings also include net capital losses of
$38 million because of additions to reserves and write-downs
related to the company's mortgage loan and real estate porfolios.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Aetna reported net income of
$472.2 million, or $4.23 per share, down 10.3 percent from $525.8
million, or $4.67 per share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue slipped 0.6 percent to $14.43 billion from
$14.51 billion in 1989. Premiums fell slightly to $9.66 billion
from $9.7 billion.

<HEAD>Chevron Blames Third-Quarter Decline On Mideast Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. on Friday reported a 3
percent drop in third-quarter earnings, blaming the decline on
rising oil prices due to tension in the Middle East.
   The nation's largest importer of crude oil reported earnings of
$403 million, or $1.14 a share, for the three months ended Sept.
30, compared with $417 million, or $1.22 a share for the same
period last year.
   Chevron said some of its losses were offset by $80 million in
special items, compared to just $7 million for such items last
year. After adjusting for those items, the company said operational
results declined 21 percent.
   Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed the decline to turmoil in the Middle East after Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug 2.
   ``Product prices ultimately must reflect raw material costs and
we would expect the competitive marketplace will have to
acknowledged this,'' he said.
   Higher prices of crude oil helped increase total revenues to
$10.6 billion for the quarter, compared with $8 billion in the
third quarter of last year, Chevron said.
   The rising cost of crude oil also has benefited Chevron's
exploration and production earnings, the company said. U.S.
exploration and production income rose from $58 million to $201
million in the quarter, while income from foreign exploration and
production increased to $197 million from $121 million.
   But Derr said Chevron, a net buyer of crude, lost money because
the higher cost of oil has not yet been recovered through higher
prices for petrleum products.
   Chevron said it charged an average 26 cents more per gallon for
those products, while they cost the company an average 35 cents
more per gallon in September than in July. Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Derr said Chevron has responded to the crisis by boosting U.S.
oil and natural gas production and increasing the amount of
gasoline and other light products extracted from crude.
   Chevron also started production in Australia to offset declines
in Canada, Nigeria and the United Kingdom.
   ``Our strategy should certainly encourage conservation, but it
must also stimulate environmentally safe development of our
resources,'' Derr said.
   For the first nine months of 1990, Chevron reoprted net income
of $1.5 billion or $4.30 a share, on revenues of $28.8 billion.
That compares with $1.1 billion or $3.31 a share, on revenues of
$23.9 billion last year.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mixed Friday in extremely quiet
trading on world currency markets amid some nervousness over the
U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   Gold prices slipped overseas, and the decline accelerated in
domestic dealings. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion
for current delivery fell $4.90 to settle at $370.90 a troy ounce.
Republic National Bank later quoted gold at $371.00, down $5.25 an
ounce.
   Traders said there was spotty dollar-buying as some investors
sought a safe haven in the U.S. currency ahead of an uncertain
weekend in the Middle East. Adding to their concern was the
disclosure that United States plans to send up to 100,000 more
troops to the area.
   ``It appears with the situation in the Persian Gulf very, very
tense, people wanted to buy back a few dollars,'' said Robert
Hatcher, a corporate dealer with Barclays Bank PLC. The dollar
typically is considered the currency of choice in times of global
turmoil.
   But countering the advance was an underlying bearish sentiment
toward the U.S. currency based on the expectation of lower interest
rates and a weakening economy. The market is anticipating that the
Federal Reserve will notch interest rates lower once the
deficit-reducing budget package is in place. Lower interest rates
make dollar-denominated securities less attractive to investors.
   Michael Malpede, a senior analyst with Refco Group Ltd.,
characterized trading as trendless. ``There's no commitment to
either'' buying or selling of dollars, he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.35 yen to a closing 128.50 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted lower at 128.00 yen. In New York
the dollar settled at 128.25 yen, unchanged from Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9555 from $1.9545 late
Thursday. In New York, it cost $1.9565 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Thursday's $1.9505.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.5130 German marks, down from 1.5185;
1.2810 Swiss francs, down from 1.2845; 5.0670 French francs, down
from 5.0820; 1,134.00 Italian lire, down from 1,136.50, and 1.1644
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1657.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates: 1.5155 German marks, up from 1.5130; 1.2795 Swiss francs, up
from 1.2765; 5.0740 French francs, up from 5.0645; 1.7083 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7050; 1,135.50 Italian lire, up from 1,132.75;
and 1.1653 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1676.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $373.75 a troy ounce
from $376.25 bid per ounce late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal
slipped to a closing bid of $373.40 an ounce from $374.80.
Financial markets in Hong Kong were closed for a holiday.
   Silver prices also declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.050 a troy ounce, down from
$4.204 on Thursday. Earlier in London, the metal fell to a late bid
price of $4.14 an ounce, from $4.24.

<HEAD>Hills Says Solving Agriculture Dispute Vital to Trade Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-EC-Summit, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
Friday that resolving a dispute over agricultural subsidies is
vital for the current round of international trade talks to meet
its end-of-year deadline.
   Hills said the dispute could scuttle four years of work on a new
trade agreement for the 105 nations which are parties to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Several European nations led by Germany oppose cuts in
government subsidies to farmers. The United States wants these
subsidies eliminated or reduced severely to allow agricultural
products to be traded more freely on world markets. U.S. farmers
would see their exports grow considerable if the subsidies are cut,
Hills said.
   The GATT negotiations, called the Uruguay Round of talks, are
aimed at reducing international subsidies, tariffs and other trade
barriers.
   Hills told a gathering sponsored by the European Community
Chamber of Commerce in the United States that it would be extremely
unlikely for the talks to be extended beyond their December
deadline.
   ``We have been at this four years,'' she said. ``The topics have
not changed.''

   The biggest criminal investigation in Wall
Street history couldn't do it. A shattered career and humbling
six-count guilty plea couldn't do it either.
   So why should eight days of testimony on three transactions out
of countless thousands over 20 years solve the mystery of Michael
Milken, one of the most enigmatic figures in Wall Street history?
   At a court hearing to help U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood
determine punishment, the government failed to stick the fatal
dagger in Milken's persona, but the junk-bond pioneer didn't emerge
as the Boy Scout his admirers would have him.
   The hearing was the first public clash of facts, ideas and
opinions on Milken, who transformed Drexel into a powerhouse
investment firm, now defunct, on the back of IOUs called junk bonds
that reshaped high finance.
   Prosecutors, who began investigating Milken in 1986, didn't
decisively prove him guilty of the crimes alleged in three
transactions. But they did demonstrate a pattern of impropriety
based on strong suggestions of illegality.
   One thing was clear: Drexel's junk bond offices on Wilshire
Boulevard in Beverly Hills, Calif., was a place of intrigue,
derring-do, outlandish pay and sometimes sleazy behavior in the
tumultuous 1980s.
   The witnesses themselves formed a sort of class picture of the
ideals and attitudes of the decade - Drexel trader James Dahl's $23
million take in 1988 (Milken made $550 million the previous year);
$450,000-a-year trader Peter Gardiner's jealousy over a $1.5
million colleague; secret ledgers, lying to a grand jury, hints to
destroy evidence and a symphony of water faucets drowning out
clandestine conversations.
   The government made three basic allegations against Milken:
stock manipulation in Wickes Cos., insider trading in Caesars World
Inc. and misappriation and bribery in Storer Communications Inc.
   As described, the alleged schemes ratcheted up the level of
cheating by the 44-year-old Milken beyond his admitted crimes. That
was the government's intent in requesting the special hearing. But
the defense appeared to deflect the main allegations.
   Prosecutors ``have certainly shown suggestive testimony that may
well convince future historians . . . Mr. Milken did everything the
government has alleged, but they haven't proven it in court,'' said
John Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University.
   ``In terms of a gear shift that shows higher level involvement
in more culpable crimes such as insider trading, I don't think the
government can be very happy at the way the evidence looks in
court,'' he said.
   Milken's lawyers characterized the six felony counts to which he
pleaded guilty as aberrations in an otherwise exemplary career. The
government said they were the tip of an iceberg of illicit
behavior. The common wisdom after the hearing was that neither
picture was entirely accurate.
   On Wickes, Drexel trader Cary Maultasch testified he manipulated
the company's stock with speculator Ivan Boesky under orders from
Gardiner. Gardiner blamed Milken, but couldn't offer any direct
evidence beyond a shouted price and an inference of bad intent.
   On Caesars World, again the link was hazy at best. Dahl said
Milken ordered him to buy Caesars bonds at a time Milken might have
had inside information about the company. But it appeared the
trades might have been part of a legitimate strategy requested by a
customer.
   The testimony on Storer may have been the most damning. Milken
appeared to offer fund managers favors in the form of personal
investments in Storer, which experts say is illegal. But no
evidence supported the government's theory of bribery.
   Beyond the specific allegations, though, a picture emerged of
less than ethical and possibly illegal activity by Milken,
underlings and some outside excutives.
   Former Drexel traders described routine securities ``parking''
at the junk-bond department, which has been prosecuted criminally
in other cases. Dahl said Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association
regularly over four years secretly held bonds for Drexel, purchased
back at a set time and price. Asked who initiated the parking, Dahl
said, ``Mike.''
   Such behavior seemed second nature. ``I parked securities
routinely,'' Gardiner testified.
   Infleunce-peddling, back-scratching and strong-arm tactics also
occurred at Drexel, testimony showed, supporting the popular notion
of the firm's power and arrogance. An investment fund manager said
a Drexel executive - not Milken - helped him land a job and then
demanded control over his work.
   Perhaps most damaging to Milken's character were stories about
the period following the Nov. 14, 1986, announcement of Boesky's
plea deal with the government that led investigators to Milken.
   Dahl testified Milken bent over near a running water faucet in a
bathroom meeting and said, ``whatever you need to do, do it.''
Drexel trader Terren Peizer said Milken ordered him to give a
secret ledger to a close Milken friend and colleague. When Peizer
was searching for documents in response to government subpoenas, he
said Milken opened an empty drawer and said ``if you don't have
them, you can't provide them.''
   But none of the former Milken subordinates - who cut deals to
cooperate in exchange for a no-prosecution guarantee, one after
lying repeatedly to a grand jury - said Milken ordered them to
destroy evidence, lie to investigators or convey inside
information.
   Through his skill and power and authority to dole out millions,
Milken achieved the loyalty of his minions, which eroded under
government threats of prosecution. Still, on the stand, they
praised his business acumen and integrity in selling deals.
   Their testimony offered no smoking guns, but it may support the
government's theory that Milken was the only one at Drexel who
could control a corrupt organization, and was careful to insulate
himself well. The defense maintains that amounts to no more than a
conspiracy theory. Judge Wood is expected to sentence Milken within
two weeks.
   ``When someone has the visibility and celebrity that Michael
Milken has,'' defense attorney Arthur Liman said during the
hearing, ``it's easy to say that everything that ever happened at
Drexel was his fault.''

<TEXT>
   Oil zigzagged wildly on the futures market
Friday, closing down more than $1 per barrel after a rally based on
war fears ran out of steam and traders began selling.
   ``They've taken it all over the place,'' said Thomas Blakeslee,
an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. ``The market
is so hungry for news, and without the rumors and news, it's come
off slightly.''
   Light sweet crude, the key grade of oil, fell $1.24 to $33.01
per barrel for December delivery contracts on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Oil had gone to a high of $35.40 per barrel
before the selloff began.
   Later delivery months all closed lower after they retreated from
gains made early in the session.
   Oil had begun the day by moving up about $1 as speculators once
again bet war was likely in the Persian Gulf. Crude then began
tumbling on hints of possible diplomatic solutions to the crisis.
   Traders were responding partly to a news report that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein reportedly sent a conciliatory letter to
French President Francois Mitterrand, although French officials
said they had no knowledge of such a letter. The market was also
moved by news of Soviet diplomatic efforts in the Mideast.
   Prices were also coming off as many traders expressed a
reluctance to hold too many oil contracts over the weekend. Fresh
in their minds was Monday's record plummet of $5.41 per barrel.
   Oil rebounded strongly with gains of $1.71 on Wednesday and
$3.17 on Thursday. For the week, crude was down 78 cents for
next-month delivery.
   Oil's big swings seemed to be coming closer together, sending
the market farther in less time than it had been moving in recent
weeks.
   ``The volatility's been extremely high,'' said William Byers, an
analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``There is some sense that time is
running out on the situation. Whether that's a correct perception,
I don't know.''
   Many traders have been thinking any military action against Iraq
is likely to occur shortly before or shortly after the U.S.
elections, less than two weeks away, Byers said.
   Blakeslee said the wild swings have been occurring on light
volume, as small players in the market feel the need to rapidly
make trades on headlines.
   ``The market will move very quickly on their panicking, if you
want to call it that, or buying,'' he said. ``Someone with deep
pockets will withstand these moves.''
   As crude shot up and them tumbled, futures contracts for refined
petroleum products moved in a similar pattern.
   Wholesale home heating oil closed down 3.42 cents at 88.25 cents
a gallon for November delivery contracts, with most later contract
months moving lower. For the week, heating oil dropped .15 cent.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 2.13 cents to 91.47 cents per
gallon on November contracts, with most other delivery months
trading lower. For the week, gasoline was up 3.56 cents.

<HEAD>Plans Sale of `Substantial' Equity Stake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retailer R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. is considering the
sale of a significant equity stake to help reduce debt, it was
disclosed Friday.
   Macy, which already has sold small stakes to finance buybacks of
some of its bonds, said it was considering more equity sales and
was ``exploring the possibility of selling a more substantial
equity interest to a buyer who shares our view of Macy's value and
future.''
   The retailer, which disclosed its plans in a letter to
stockholders, did not identify any prospective investors.
   Macy said the sale ``will allow us to make a major reduction in
our interest costs.''
   It was likely the proceeds of the sale would go toward retiring
some Macy high-yield junk bonds. The risky IOUs were used to
finance the retailer's 1986, management-led, debt-financed
takeover, known as a leveraged buyout.
   The letter accompanied Macy's 10-K filing, the annual report
that companies with publicly held securities are required to issue
and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   In the report, Macy said it lost nearly $80 million in its
fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $57.4 million in the same
period of 1989.
   Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation - the key
measure of fiscal health for a firm after a leveraged buyout -
totaled $144 million after accounting provisions, down from $156
million a year earlier.
   The company's sales, which Macy said were hurt by the economic
weakness that plagued other retailers, rose to $1.63 billion from
$1.59 billion.
   Macy's fourth quarter ended July 28.
   For the full year, Macy said it lost $215.3 million, compared
with a loss of $63 million in fiscal 1989.
   Sales for the year rose to $7.27 billion from $6.97 billion the
previous year.
   Macy's losses were not a surprise as they became public last
week after a meeting between Macy executives and some of the
company's creditors.
   They also had been expected since the company announced earlier
this year that it had suffered a disastrous Christmas 1989 season.
   Macy and other retailers were forced to take steep markdowns to
compete with highly indebted Campeau Corp.'s department stores,
which slashed prices in hopes of bringing in sales and avoiding
bankruptcy court.
   In its letter, Macy noted several previously announced steps it
has taken to reduce debt, including the sale of credit operations
to GE Capital Corp. Macy said the move would lower its $4.8 billion
debt burden by $1.5 billion.
   The company also noted it had reduced inventory by $600 million
and lowered expenses to compensate for the sluggish retail
environment.
   Macy and other retailers are expecting the upcoming Christmas
season to be difficult, as consumers have become reluctant to spend
amid the uncertain economic climate and with the Middle East crisis
unresolved.
   ``We are prepared for the sluggish economy and we are taking
advantage of market conditions to imrprove the financial structure
of the company,'' the retailer said in its letter.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, the company owns I. Magnin and Bullock's stores in
California and the West. It also owns specialty stores including
Charter Club, Aeropostale and Fantasies by Morgan Taylor, which are
stocked with Macy's private label apparel brands.

   The stock market dropped sharply Friday,
unsettled by worries about the banking industry and prospects in
the Persian Gulf.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 48.02 to 2,436.14,
finishing the week with a loss of 84.65 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
364 up, 1,164 down and 451 unchanged.
   Oil prices fluctuated erratically amid intensifying speculation
that the showdown in the Persian Gulf might be moving closer to
open conflict.
   Analysts said that gave little encouragement to investors
already worried about the shaky state of the domestic economy.
   Sharply higher costs for gasoline, heating oil and a wide range
of other goods are expected to act as a drag on consumer spending
and business investment at a time when the economy is already
burdened with debt problems and a battered real estate market.
   Brokers said traders seemed to have grown increasingly uneasy
about the health of many large banks.
   Manufacturers Hanover fell 3 to 17 after remarks by a company
official that were interpreted as raising the possibility of a
dividend reduction.
   Among other prominent commercial banking issues, Citicorp
dropped { to 11&lsqb;; Chase Manhattan \ to 11~; Chemical Banking 1 to
11\; BankAmerica 1&lsqb; to 18}; NCNB 1 to 17~, and Security Pacific 1|
to 18|.
   Dime Savings Bank of New York tumbled 1\ to 2|. The company
posted a $153.62 million loss for the third quarter, citing an
increase in its loan-loss reserve, and suspended its dividend.
   Elsewhere in the financial-services sector, American Express
fell 1&lsqb; to 18|; Primerica 2 to 19, and Merrill Lynch 1} to 17~.
   But Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, which reported lower third-quarter
earnings and announced plans for an overhaul of its operations,
rose \ to 31.
   Unisys led the active list, down 1&lsqb; at 2\. On Thursday the
company reported a loss of $356.8 million for the third quarter and
said it might be in the red for the fourth quarter as well.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.19 million
shares, down from 141.46 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 171.59 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $47.16 billion, or 1.63
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.80 to 166.71.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 6.34 to 358.50, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 5.46 at 304.71.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 5.38 to 334.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 291.39, down 1.39.

The fiscal. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal deficit soared to $220.4 billion,
the second highest ever, in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, the
Treasury Department reported Friday.
   It was the 21st straight year in which the government spent more
than it took in. The fiscal 1990 red ink was 43.7 percent more than
the $153.3 billion imbalance last year.
   The Bush administration had forecast a $123.8 billion deficit in
its initial forecast last February. But by its midyear estimate in
July, the administration had boosted its projection to $220.1
billion.
   The Treasury announcement came as the administration and
Congress appeared to be nearing completion of a package of tax
hikes and spending cuts designed to erase $500 billion from the
deficit in five years, including $40.1 billion in the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   But the administration says government red ink still will total
$253.6 billion during the current fiscal year - if the
administration and Congress can stick to the budget reduction goal.
Ifnot, the administration projects a whopping $293.7 billion gap.
   The fiscal 1991 projection excludes the estimated $1 billion a
month the government is spending on its military forces in the
Persian Gulf, although it expects to regain half of that from
contributions from other nations.
   Despite inclusion of the Persian Gulf operations in the last two
months of the fiscal 1990 budget, Defense Department spending was
$500 million less than the administration's July forecast of $290.2
billion.
   Brady and Darman explained that while Operation Desert Shield
boosted spending by $1.2 billion, the outlays were offset by $1.7
billion in cuts in military construction and other programs.
   The deficit had reached $241.7 billion in the 11 months ending
Aug. 31, surpassing the previous record of $221.2 billion set in
fiscal 1986.
   But that was cut because the government spent $25 billion in
August that it normally would have spent in September to avoid late
payments due to the Labor Day weekend, thus erasing that amount
from the final month's outlays.
   The federal deficit had fallen beneath $200 billion during each
year following 1986, dropping to $149.7 billion in fiscal 1987,
$155.2 billion in 1988 and $153.3 billion in 1989.
   It was the 24th deficit in the last 25 years. The government has
not operated in the black since posting a $3.2 billion surplus in
fiscal 1969.
   Revenues amounted to $102.9 billion in September, pushing
receipts for the year up 4.1 percent to $1.03 trillion. But outlays
totaled $82.0 billion last month and $1.25 trillion for the year,
surpassing 1989 spending by 9.4 percent. The deficit is the
difference between income and outlays.
   September's $20.8 billion surplus compared with a $6.1 billion
deficit during the same month of fiscal 1989.
   Contributing to the red ink was smaller tax collections than
anticipated.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and budget director Richard
G. Darman said in a statement that individual income taxes totaled
$466.9 billion, $9.2 billion less than projected last July. At the
same time, corporate taxes totalled $93.5 billion, $4.7 billion
less than estimated.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency charged with
bailing out the savings and loan industry, cost the government $8.8
billion in September and $46.5 billion during the year - $10.6
billion less than forecast in July.
   Brady and Darman said the smaller outlays were due to
``slower-than-anticipated resolution of failed thrifts.''
   The government hopes to regain much of the bailout cost by
selling real estate, loans, securities and other assets from failed
thrifts. That would help reduce the deficit in future years.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories were the military,
Social Security and other programs of the Department of Health and
Human Services and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $20.5 billion in September and $289.8
billion for the year, down 1.7 percent from 1989.
   Social Security payments amounted to $759 million for the month
and $245.0 billion for the year, a 7.7 percent increase over 1989.
   Other HHS payments, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$14.0 billion in August and $193.7 billion for 1990, up 12.4
percent.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $17.3 billion for the
month and $264.9 billion for the year, a 10.0 percent increase over
1989. It was the second straight year that interest has exceeded
Social Security spending.

   Soybean futures prices tumbled below $6 a bushel Friday to a
2{-month low on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late sell-off ahead
of what was expected to be the biggest harvest weekend of the year.
   Grain futures also closed lower.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures weakened, precious
metals fell and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 4 cents to 10} cents lower in Chicago
with the contract for delivery in November at $5.94} a bushel, the
lowest daily settlement for a near-term soybean contract since Aug.
8.
   The market opened lower amid speculation that the soybean
harvest will move rapidly toward completion this weekend due to
forecasts for mild, dry weather in the Midwest.
   Grain and soybean prices typically fall at harvest time as the
new supplies come to market.
   Some analysts said Friday's sell-off partly reflected
profit-taking by speculators after a run up to prices near $6.15 a
bushel earlier this week.
   Selling by speculative funds snowballed when the price for
November soybean deliveries slipped below $6 bushel about 45
minutes before the close, said Gerald Zusel, a vice president in
the grain-trading division of E.D.&amp; F. Man International Futures
Inc.
   ``We had a technical breakdown,'' he said. ``There was big, big
fund selling in there today.''
   He said the soybean harvest could be finished within a week,
leaving farmers to concentrate on getting in the rest of the corn.
   The Agriculture Department said earlier this week that the
soybean harvest was 57 percent complete as of last Sunday.
   Analyst David Armstrong of AgriVisor Services Inc. in
Bloomington, Ill., said soybean harvesting was already nearly over
in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota.
   ``It's kind of hard to find a reason to be bullish right now,''
Armstrong said. ``If the weather stays good, the Corn Belt states
will clearly be in a wrap-up or at least a wind-down situation by a
a week from now.''
   Wheat futures settled 1} cents lower to } cent higher with
December at $2.62\ a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 2} cents lower
with December at $2.27} a bushel; oats were 3} cents to 4 cents
lower with December at $1.20 a bushel;
   Crude oil and refined products for near-term delivery fell
sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange, giving up some of
Thursday's gains.
   The selling reflected pre-weekend profit-taking and a lack of
significant fresh developments in the Persian Gulf, analysts said.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 32 cents to $1.68 lower
with December at $33.01 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to 3.42
cents lower with November at 88.25 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 2.13 cents lower to .22 cent higher with November at
91.47 cents a gallon.
   The drop in oil prices prompted heavy selling of gold, which had
rallied along with crude oil on Thursday. A 48-point plunge in the
Dow Jones industrials average spurred further selling of precious
metals on perceptions that industrial demand for gold, silver and
platinum would decline in a weakened economy.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $4.90 to $5.40
lower with October at $370.90 a troy ounce; silver was 15.4 cents
to 17.9 cents lower with October at $4.05 a troy ounce.
   Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid slack retail demand and unprofitable operating margins for
packers, analysts said. Cattle futures were little changed.
   Live cattle settled .25 cent lower to .13 cent higher with
December at 77.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .25 cent higher with November at 87.17 cents a pound; live hogs
were .18 cent to .87 cent lower with December at 52.95 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.47 cents to 1.9 cents lower with
February at 62.95 cents a pound.

<HEAD>American Says UAL-Pan Am Deal Worth $100 Million More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. could get at least $100 million more
for the London routes it has agreed to sell to UAL Corp. for $400
million, American Airlines Inc. Chairman Robert Crandall said
Friday as he again tried to thwart the sale.
   ``Although our analysis is not yet complete, we estimate that
the route authorities alone are worth in excess of $500 million,''
Crandall wrote Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett in his second
letter in two days.
   ``We would welcome an opportunity to make an offer to acquire
those authorities on terms substantially better'' than UAL's,
Crandall said Friday.
   New York-based Pan Am received the letter, but had no comment,
said spokeswoman Elizabeth Hlinko. A spokesman for Chicago-based
UAL also declined to comment.
   On Thursday, Crandall sought to start an auction for the London
routes, saying Fort Worth-based American could top the $400 million
UAL agreed to pay Pan Am. The deal also includes two Boeing 747
jets, plus participation in joint marketing and frequent flier
programs.
   Plaskett responded that Pan Am had a binding agreement with
United.
   ``Our board, after careful consideration of all of the detailed
terms of the United proposals, determined that it was in the best
interests of Pan Am to enter into the legal, binding agreement with
United that was announced on Tuesday,'' said Plaskett, a one-time
marketing executive at American.
   ``I had understood from our many conversations, including our
most recent one, that American would be interested only in buying
routes and did not wish to enter into a broad-scale agreement with
Pan Am,'' Plaskett said.
   But Crandall replied Friday, ``Frankly, I do not recall your
ever broaching the subject of a long-term marketing program in our
discussions concerning American's interest in acquiring Pan Am
route authorities.''
   Pan Am's deal with UAL came after fruitless efforts by Pan Am to
find a merger partner or buyer for the airline, which has suffered
big losses in recent years.
   Crandall's effort shows the enormous importance American
attaches to obtaining routes to London, the gateway to Europe and a
crucial destination for any global airline.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murdoch Magazines said Friday it suspended
publication of Men's Life magazine after one issue due to the
depressed economy.
   The quarterly went on sale in September. It was one of a flurry
of new or revamped general-interest magazines aimed at upscale male
readers announced in recent months.
   ``Reader response to the first issue was very encouraging, but
it will take time to build the necessary circulation and
advertising, and it is too costly to go ahead in the present
economic environment,'' said Leslie Hinton, president of Murdoch
Magazines, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
   ``When the economy improves we will relaunch Men's Life as a
monthly,'' he added.
   Men's Life was aimed at men 30-50 years old with a median income
of $48,000.
   Among other men's magazines launched recently were a revamped
Details and Men Inc., a combination of the men's fashion magazine
called M and Manhattan Inc., a business magazine that folded.
   In addition, Straight Arrow Publishers Inc., which puts out
Rolling Stone and Us magazines, said it is developing a men's
magazine for next fall.
   Advertising revenue has dropped sharply for many magazines and
newspapers in recent months as the economy has faltered.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall on Nervousness Over Budget, Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices fell Friday as traders had some
last-minute jitters about the federal budget agreement and as
tensions appeared to increase in the Middle East.
   The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond slipped 7-32
point, or about $2.18 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which
rises as the bond's price falls, edged up to 8.77 percent from 8.75
percent late Thursday.
   Analysts said the market was worried that the House, which was
preparing for vote on the budget agreement, might not approve the
measure.
   The credit markets have been waiting anxiously for Congress to
pass a budget cutting bill because the Federal Reserve has made a
budget package a prerequisite for lower interest rates.
   Analysts said traders also were unsettled by news that more U.S.
troops were being sent to Saudi Arabia. In announcing the move on
Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the extra troops will
give U.S. military authorities more leverage in dealing with Iraq's
huge army.
   The news reawakened fears that war could break out in the
Persian Gulf, leading to even higher oil prices and accelerated
inflation. Bond traders fear that if inflation speeds up, the Fed
will have less leeway to push interest rates lower.
   The market ignored a decline in oil prices Friday. The December
contract for light, sweet crude fell $1.24 to $33.01 a barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term
maturities ranged from 1-32 point higher to 1-32 point lower,
intermediate maturities fell 1-16 point to 3-32 point, and
long-term issues slipped between &lsqb; point and 7-32 point, the
Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.70 to 1,156.54.
   Yields on outstanding three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.37
percent as the discount fell 4 basis points from the levels in
Thursday's auction to 7.15 percent. Yields on six-month bills fell
to 7.45 percent as the discount slipped 5 basis points from the
levels in Thursday's auction to 7.10 percent. Yields on one-year
bills declined to 7.41 percent as the discount dropped 3 basis
points to 6.96 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, was 7 13-16 percent, down from 8 percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose &lsqb; point . The average yield to maturity
fell to 7.72 percent from 7.73 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Big Deal Off Between Ball, Continental Can</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc. on Friday scrapped
an agreement to sell Continental Can Europe to Ball Corp. because
of what the companies called a lack of bank financing that they
blamed on recent market turmoil.
   The tentative sale was announced in July. Ball said it was
acquiring 33 European metal packaging plants from Continental Can,
which would have given it a foothold in one of the world's most
rapidly expanding markets.
   Continental was to have received $625 million in cash and $400
million in stock, giving it a 29 percent stake in Ball, the
fifth-largest producer of beer and soft drink cans in the United
States.
   But the plug was pulled on Friday, the companies said in a joint
statement. ``On a financial and operating basis, both Ball and CCE
have been performing at record levels in 1990. Unfortunately, due
in major part to the recent turmoil in world financial markets, and
in particular the U.S. banking community, Ball has not yet arranged
financing, and the certainty of closing the transaction on the
agreed upon terms and time frame have become compromised,'' the
statement said.
   The scrapped deal comes against a background of growing
reluctance by commercial banks to make loans as economic growth has
slowed and a crisis persists in the Persian Gulf, which has driven
up oil prices and further weakened the U.S. economy.
   Most of the top commercial banks in the United States have
reported sharply lower earnings recently because of rising defaults
on existing loans, particularly to Third World countries and
commercial real estate projects.
   Ball still plans to acquire the remaining interest in its 50
percent-owned Ball-InCon Glass Packaging Corp. joint venture. In
that deal, also announced in July and due to be completed by the
end of the year, Ball will pay $65 million in cash to its joint
venture partner, Holland-American Investment Corp.
   The Continental Can purchase was designed to help the company
enter the fastly growing European market. Ball is a major can
supplier to the cola giants, and Ball Chairman Richard M. Ringoen
said his company hoped to ride their coattails into Eastern Europe.
   Coca-Cola Co. receives 25 percent of its soft drink cans in
Europe from Continental, a privately held business of Peter Kiewit
Sons of Omaha, Neb.
   Continental Can Europe, which employs 10,000 people, had sales
of $1.47 billion in 1989 and projects sales this year to grow to
$1.66 billion. The company makes food, beverage and general metal
containers, metal closures and plastic containers.
   Last year, Ball reported 63.9 percent of its sales came from
packaging products. Combined packaging sales of Ball, Continental
Can Europe and Ball-InCon last year would have been $2.78 billion,
the company said.

<HEAD>America West, Midway Report Quarterly Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   America West Airlines and Midway Airlines on Friday reported net
losses for the third quarter. Both blamed higher jet fuel prices
for at least some of their losses.
   America West, based in Phoenix, said it lost nearly $22 million
in the quarter ended Sept. 30, while Chicago-based Midway lost
$18.7 million.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>America West</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   America West reported a loss of $21.95 million or $1.21 per
share in the quarter, compared to a net profit of $5.8 million, or
28 cents per share, for the third quarter of 1989.
   Operating revenue came to $338.6 million vs. $243.4 million last
year.
   ``We are disappointed in the results for the quarter and are not
optimistic about the balance of the year 1990,'' said Al Frei,
chief financial officer, who said jet fuel costs rose $15.5 million
in the quarter, or about 19 cents a gallon over last year.
   However, the company said it was in a much stronger position
than in June because of a 40 percent increase in traffic and a
``sound cash position'' after last month's agreement to buy or
lease 74 to 118 Airbus Industrie A-320s from three companies in a
deal worth up to $5 billion.
   As part of the agreement, America West received cash advances,
support and spare parts totaling $220 million, company officials
said.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, the company reported a net
loss of $18.4 million, or 94 cents per common share, compared to
net income of $18.9 million, or 92 cents per common share, for the
same period last year.
   Revenues rose to $969.6 million vs. $715.2 million.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Midway</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Midway attributed its $18 million loss to skyrocketing fuel
costs, as well as the company's expansion efforts and matching of
competitors' discount fares.
   For the three-month period ending Sept. 30, it lost $18.73
million, or $1.96 per share, compared to a loss of $1.87 million,
or 19 cents per share, for the period last year.
   Revenues increased to $166.6 million, up 36 percent from $121.8
million for 1989.
   Midway's aviation fuel costs rose $10 million per month since
the Iraqi invasion, said David R. Hinson, chairman and chief
executive officer. The increase forced Midway earlier this month to
abandon its Philadelphia hub and cancel 61 daily flights by next
spring.
   Deep discounts in other airlines' fares also prevented Midway
from raising its rates to cover losses, Hinson said.
   For the first nine months, Midway lost $53 million or $5.58 per
share, compared to a profit of $6.1 million or 57 cents last year.
   Revenues rose to $494.4 million from $365.5 million.

<HEAD>Monsanto Profits Down 41 Percent; Company Plans Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monsanto Co. on Friday reported a 41 percent
drop in net earnings for the third quarter and announced a
wide-ranging restructuring plan at its second-biggest subsidiary.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, the company had net earnings of
$74 million, or 59 cents a share, down from $126 million, or 94
cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.
   Sales of $2.14 billion were 4 percent higher than $2.06 billion
last year.
   The company said higher oil prices and the slowdown in the U.S.
economy cut into profits severely, as did continuing drought
conditions in Europe and the western United States.
   ``Our third-quarter financial performance was well below what we
expected going into the quarter,'' said Richard Mahoney, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   The planned restructuring of the Monsanto Agricultural Co. will
include a 9 percent cut in the number of salaried workers, the
planned sale of the company's animal feed ingredients business, and
a reorganization of management style.
   The company's job reduction program will trim about 300 of the
subsidiary's 3,400 workers, partly through the use of a voluntary
retirement program, company spokesman Mark Schannon said.
   The sale of the feed ingredients business includes plants in
Alvin, Texas, and Nitro, W.Va., as well as research facilities in
St. Louis. The business had sales of $160 million in 1989.
   Robert Shapiro, president of the agricultural subsidiary, said
the business did not fit the new direction in which the subsidiary
was headed.
   Monsanto, headquartered in St. Louis, makes a wide variety of
chemicals including compounds that are used in automobile
dashboards, windshields and tires.
   The company also manufactures pesticides and animal feed
supplements, owns a pharmaceutical subsidiary and sells Nutrasweet,
an artificial sweetener.
   For the first nine months, Monsanto's net earnings were $515
million, or $3.96 a share, 13 percent lower than the $589 million,
or $4.33 a share, reported for the first nine months of 1989.
   Sales for the first nine months were $6.79 billion, up 2 percent
from $6.67 billion for the same period in 1989.

<HEAD>Air Force Tells Boeing To Correct Problems With New Missile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Air Force has warned Boeing Aerospace &amp;
Defense Group that it could lose a nuclear missile contract if
problems with the weapon aren't fixed.
   The service has sent Boeing a ``cure notice,'' giving it until
Nov. 30 to describe how it will fix problems with the SRAM-2
missile, which is over cost and behind schedule, said a spokesman
at the Air Force's Aeronautical Systems Division at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.
   Milt Furness, spokesman for Boeing Aerospace, said Wednesday
that Boeing was preparing a response and would file it by the
deadline.
   ``Basically, we're going to tell them how we will fix the
problems and the schedule we will meet to do that,'' Furness said.
   Furness said the letter from the Air Force, dated Sept. 10,
outlined problems with the missile's solid-fuel motor and with
computer software for the missile's targeting and guidance systems.
   The rocket motor, supplied by Hercules Inc., has had problems
with its solid propellant cracking during cold-temperature tests,
Furness said. He said he could not give details on what was wrong
with the software, which is being developed by Boeing.
   Boeing received a $214 million contract 3{ years ago to develop
the SRAM-2, which stands for short range attack missile.
Eventually, the Air Force hopes to buy more than 1,600 of the
air-to-ground missiles at a total cost of $2.5 billion to $3
billion, Furness said.

<HEAD>Polaroid Seeks Higher Award From Kodak; Kodak Wants To Lower It</HEAD>

   Polaroid Corp. asked a federal judge Friday to
increase its record $909.5 million patent infringement judgment
against Eastman Kodak Co. by $173 million.
   Kodak, meanwhile, asked the same U.S. District Court judge to
reduce the award by $48 million.
   The motions follow Judge A. David Mazzone's Oct. 12 decision
that ended a 14-year legal battle with what is believed to be the
largest patent infringement award in history.
   Mazzone ordered Kodak to pay Polaroid the $909.5 million for
infringing on Polaroid patents for instant cameras and film when
Kodak entered the market in 1976. He also ruled the infringement
was not willful.
   Cambridge-based Polaroid had sought $12 billion, and Mazzone's
award was considered a disappointment in the investment community.
   In Friday's 40-page motion, Polaroid asks the judge to
reconsider his calculations in four major categories, said Polaroid
spokesman Sam Yanes.
   The categories involve calculations of such factors as interest
rates, increased film sales in 1984 and 1985, lost film sales and
special costs related to manufacturing capabilities, Yanes said.
   Kodak spokesman Paul Allen said his company based its 12-page
motion on ``clerical errors'' in the calculation of damages,
royalty and interest.
   Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., originally argued it should pay
Polaroid $177 million, equal to about 5 percent of its sales of
instant cameras and film from 1976 to 1985.
   After Mazzone issues his decision on the two motions, the two
companies have 30 days to decide whether they will appeal his
original judgment to the U.S. Appellate Court in Washington, D.C.,
the spokesmen said.
   Both Allen and Yanes said their companies were still considering
an appeal.
   Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York, said Friday's motions do not challenge the basic premises
that Mazzone used in rendering his judgment.
   ``In other words, they're not asking him to change his logic or
principles per say on any points of law,'' Landry said.
   Rendering a decision would involve ``whose calculations were
right and whose computer was right,'' she said.
   Theoretically, Mazzone could grant both motions, which would
mean that Polaroid would receive an additional $125 million, Landry
said.
   Disappointed though Polaroid may be in the amount of the award,
if the company appeals the decision, it may only do so on legal
issues, not monetary amounts, Landry said. Moreover, Polaroid could
end up with a lower award, she said.
   The case dates back to 1972, when Polaroid introduced the SX-70
color instant camera, and a deal with Kodak to make film for the
camera fell through.
   Instant photography was invented by Polaroid founder Edwin Land
in 1947 and first marketed in 1948. Polaroid held a monopoly for
almost 30 years until Kodak entered the field in 1976.

<HEAD>Seeks to Delay Payment on Pension Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troubled Pan Am Corp. said Friday evening it
wants to delay the payment of $30 million into its pension plan.
   The request came in a filing with the Internal Revenue Service
that would not be made public, Pan Am spokewoman Pamela Hanlon
said. Pan Am refused to say how its business might be affected if
the IRS turns down the request.
   ``We have submitted an application to the IRS to defer
aproximately $30 million of pension payments that were due on the
date of our transfer of our internal German service to Lufthansa
German Airlines,'' Hanlon said. ``That sale took place today.''
   The routes from the $150 million sale will be turned over to
Lufthansa on Sunday, Pan Am said.
   Ms. Hanlon did not know how long Pan Am hoped to put off the
pension payment, but she said the company will pay immediately if
it must.
   ``We have the cash to pay it,'' Ms. Hanlon said. ``It is simply
a determination on our part that by deferring the pension payment
we would be able to maximize our cash position.''
   She declined elaboration, but said Pan Am's move was related to
higher jet fuel costs and a sluggish U.S. economy that have hit the
airline industry hard.
   Pan Am had already deferred paying $53 million into the pension
plan last month in an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., the federal agency that oversees pension fund administration
by companies.
   The $30 million payment that Pan Am is now seeking to delay is
part of that previous deferral, with the remaining $23 million due
on Feb. 28.
   The IRS filing by Pan Am comes just four days after the carrier
said it planned to sell prized routes from five U.S. cities to
London in a $400 million deal with rival UAL Corp.
   AMR Corp., the corporate parent of American Airlines, then said
it wanted a chance to bid on the routes. American said Friday that
it believed the London routes were worth more than $500 million.
   Pan Am has said its deal with UAL, the parent of United
Airlines, was more than just a sale of the London routes, because
it also contained a marketing agreement in which the two carriers
would try to feed each other passengers by coordinating certain
flights.

   The first commercial pilots to be convicted
for flying a jetliner while intoxicated were sentenced to prison
Friday by a judge who reproached them for risking lives and
breaking the trust of passengers.
   ``Who can comprehend an entire crew alcohol-impaired?'' U.S.
District Judge James Rosenbaum said. ``It is a crime against our
sense of security. In that sense, all of us are a victim of this
crime.''
   Rosenbaum indicated he reluctantly followed federal sentencing
guidelines in ordering year-long prison terms for Robert Kirchner,
36, of Highland Ranch, Colo., who was flying the plane, and flight
engineer Joseph Balzer, 35, of Antioch, Tenn. The flight captain,
Norman Lyle Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga., was sentenced to 16
months.
   ``I have grave doubts that the guidelines fit the crime,'' said
Rosenbaum, who considered stiffer sentences.
   Kirchner and Balzer were freed pending their appeals. Prouse
didn't ask to be freed pending an appeal, but the judge gave him
five days to file a request.
   The sentences also bar them from flying planes with passengers
for the three years of their subsequent probation.
   It was the first federal prosecution under a 1986 law making it
a crime to operate a commercial airplane under the influence of
drugs or alcohol. The law presumes an operator is under the
influence of alcohol at .10 percent blood-alcohol level.
   The law also applies to commercial boats, trains and passenger
buses. The maximum penalty is 15 years in prison and a $250,000
fine.
   The judge said the three men put job security ahead of their
passengers' lives March 8 when they flew a Boeing 727 from Fargo,
N.D., to the Twin Cities after a night of heavy drinking at a bar.
The plane, carrying 91 people, flew smoothly and landed safely at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where the pilots were
arrested.
   ``What difference does it make that you landed the flight
safely?'' Rosenbaum said. ``The danger was there.''
   Prouse admitted to drinking more than 15 rum and cola drinks at
the bar. Balzer and Kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer
and left the bar about one hour before Prouse.
   They flew out the next morning.
   In tests about two hours after the plane landed, Prouse had a
blood-alcohol level of .13 percent. Kirchner's was .06 percent.
Balzer's was .08 percent.
   ``Did you think about your passengers?'' Rosenbaum asked. ``You
certainly considered the risks to your jobs at Northwest Airlines -
to your income.''
   Rosenbaum was referring to a warning the pilots ignored before
the flight took off.
   Acting on the anonymous tip from a patron at the bar, FAA
inspector Verle Addison met the cockpit crew at their departure
gate. He told the pilots he smelled alcohol and wondered aloud if
they had violated the FAA rule against drinking within eight hours
of a scheduled flight. He said there would be no violation unless
the plane departed.
   While Addison was on the telephone to superiors in Chicago, the
plane took off.
   The defendants expressed relief at the length of their
sentences.
   ``It's less than what I expected,'' Prouse said. ``I'll do the
16 months one day at a time. I can't walk out until I walk in.''
   Prouse, a pilot for 22 years at Northwest and a veteran of 160
combat flights in Vietnam, told Rosenbaum the arrest prompted him
to seek treatment for alcoholism, a disease that killed both his
parents.
   ``I just want to say I'm sorry,'' Kirchner said in court. ``I'm
sorry to the public, aviation community, friends, family, wife and
two sons.''
   Northwest fired the pilots. The Federal Aviation Administration
stripped their licenses.
   In April, a Northwest pilot refused to fly a plane bound for
Atlanta after a passenger accused him of being drunk. Blood tests
were negative.

<HEAD>In Written Testimony, Drexel Executive Supports Milken on Caesars
Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
official said in court papers filed Friday that Michael Milken was
unaware of a 1983 agreement to advise a client central to a
government charge of insider trading.
   John Kissick, ex-head of Drexel's West Coast corporate finance
department, testified for Milken's defense in a bid to exonerate
the former junk-bond financier from insider trading in Caesars
World Inc. bonds.
   The government, in a pre-sentencing hearing that ended Thursday,
offered testimony implying Milken knew Drexel was advising Caesars
on a debt exchange when he ordered his traders to purchase bonds of
the casino company.
   Sentencing of Milken on his guilty plea to six trading-related
felony counts is not expected until after next week, a clerk for
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said Friday.
   Milken attended a meeting with Caesars and Drexel executives on
June 29, 1983, at which the government claims Milken was a
``leading proponent'' of a debt-for-equity restructuring for
Caesars.
   Former Drexel trader James Dahl testified at the hearing that
Milken at some point ordered him and other traders to purchase
Caesars bonds from customers. But he couldn't when the directive
was given.
   Drexel on July 15 announced it was advising Caesars on a debt
restructuring, which sent the bonds soaring in value. The
government claims Milken ordered the purchases because he had
inside knowledge of Drexel's plans to manage the debt-for-equity
restructuring.
   Prosecutors also claim Milken purchased $2.65 million worth of
Caesars bonds on July 1 for a personal account and sold in late
July at a $553,000 profit.
   Kissick testified the June 29 meeting had no formal agenda and
several proposals for helping the company were discussed.
   ``I cannot recall who proposed what, but I have attended over
100 meetings like this with Michael Milken and it is not Mr.
Milken's style to stress any one option,'' he said.
   Kissick said no decision was made at the meeting about Caesars,
or even whether Drexel would be hired to advise the company.
   Kissick said that Caesars on July 1 told him it was interested
in exchanging debt for equity. He said he assigned an executive in
Drexel's San Francisco office to work with Caesars.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, Michael Milken had no involvement
with our relationship with Caesars'' between June 29 and July 15,
Kissick testified.
   Supporting testimony given Thursday, Kissick said Milken was out
of the country on vacation for much of the period.
   Milken faces up to 28 years in prison. The eight-day
pre-sentencing hearing was on alleged illegal trading beyong the
six counts he has admitted the government said shows Milken
deserves a lengthy prison term.

<HEAD>Allied-Signal Earnings Down In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allied-Signal Inc. on Friday
announced a 13 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, in part
because of a worldwide economic slowdown.
   Though sales rose in the aerospace, automotive and chemical
divisions of the company, profits were eroded by competitive
pricing, the expense of new product development and the higher cost
of petroleum-based raw materials, the company said.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, earnings totaled $105 million,
or 76 cents a share, on revenues of $3 billion. That compares to
earnings of $121 million, or 81 cents a share, on sales of $28
billion for the same period last year.
   ``Each of our three core businesses attained slightly higher
sales, although we are starting to feel the effects of recessionary
conditions both here and overseas,'' said Edward L. Hennessy Jr.,
chairman and chief executive officer. ``We are managing all our
costs aggressively to combat the effects of the economic
slowdown.''
   The sharpest drop in profits was in automotive sales. Net income
for the quarter rose to $961 million from $873 million for the same
period last year, but profits dropped to $3 million from $11
million. Sales were fueled by a favorable foreign exchange and
sales of antilock brakes and airbags, but profits were eroded by
the cost of developing the products, the company said.
   Allied-Signals's nine month earnings totaled $355 million, or
$2.54 per share, vs. $413 million, or $2.77 per share, in 1989.
Nine month sales totaled $9.2 billion in 1990, vs. $8.9 billion in
1989.

<HEAD>Shakeup After Ex-Chairman Testifies at Milken Hearing</HEAD>

   Enstar Group Inc. announced a
restructuring Friday after its ex-chairman admitted at Michael
Milken's pre-sentencing hearing that he had bilked the company of
fees for personal profit.
   Enstar also said it had hired an attorney to review the
activities of Richard Grassgreen, the ex-chairman and longtime
Milken associate who agreed to pleaded guilty to two felony counts
earlier this week.
   Enstar, which has retailing and financial services interests, is
the successor to Kinder-Care Inc., a day-care company built largely
with junk bond financing arranged by Milken and his old firm,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Grassgreen testified against Milken under a plea agreement
related to pocketing up to $500,000 from investments made by his
company through Drexel. The charges do not involve Milken.
   Grassgreen said at the hearing, though, that Milken personally
offered him special equity investments in a 1985 takeover deal, a
central allegation made by the government against the junk-bond
financier. Grassgreen also pleaded guilty to failing to report that
investment to Enstar's board.
   Under the plea deal, Grassgreen agreed to remit to Enstar all
funds related to the previously undisclosed commitment fees for
Enstar to participate in junk-bond offerings. The fees were placed
in a partnership controlled by Grassgreen.
   Enstar said Friday that four of its eight board members had
resigned.
   ``It's a positive step,'' said Jo Ann Paddock, who heads a
stockholder group. ``They were too closely related to Grassgreen.''
   Three of the four departed directors - Harris C. Friedman,
Donald M. Kaplan and Stephen M. Lazovitz - will continue to be
directors of American Savings and Loan Association of Florida,
which is 50 percent owned by Enstar.
   The fourth director, Birmingham attorney J. Mason Davis, cited
other time commitments in his resignation.
   Enstar's new chairman, investment banker Rod Frazer said he
hopes to sell the thrift, as well as Enstar's insurance company,
Western Reserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio.
   Frazer said he wants to retain Enstar's retail subsidiary, which
includes 735 Shoe City, Bargain Town, Simply 6 and Max 10 discount
stores in 11 states. Enstar also said it no longer expects to meet
a projection of $15 million in earnings for the year. A week before
his resignation, Grassgreen announced cut the earnings projection
from $30 million and laid off 70 corporate employees.
   Kinder-Care, formed in 1969, became the nation's largest chain
of day-care centers and went on an expansion spree in the 1980s,
using Drexel financing to buy retail chains, an insurance company,
a thrift and a hunting magazine.
   Faced with mounting debts, Kinder-Care sold its day-care
division to a new company, Kinder-Care Learning Centers, and
renamed the rest Enstar Group Inc.
