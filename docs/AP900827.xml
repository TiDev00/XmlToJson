   A Death Row inmate died after being
found tied to a recreation yard fence with a jump rope around his
neck, officials said Monday.
   The prisoner, Calvin J. Williams, 30, was found unconscious at
the state prison here Sunday, said Charles Brown, a spokesman for
the state Department of Criminal Justice.
   Williams once vowed he never would be put to death without a
struggle, Brown said.
   The case was being investigated as a homicide, said Walker
County Sheriff's Department Detective Don Hampton.
   Williams had been on death row since Sept. 11, 1980 for the
rape-strangulation earlier that year of Emily Anderson, a Houston
travel agent.
   Williams, with a history of violence, was found tied to the
fence in a death row recreation area. He had been alone in his
section of the yard although another inmate, David Gibbs, was in
another section of the yard. There is no gate that would allow
Gibbs to enter Williams' side of the area, Hampton said.
   After sentenced to death, prison records showed he was involved
in five fights within four years and was cited numerous times for
destruction of state property.
   Williams, who was black, was a target of a homemade bomb during
a September 1984 attack blamed on prison racial violence. Williams
suffered burns over 17 percent of his body and also was stabbed and
received a broken leg.

<HEAD>First Of 60 Stolen Audubon Prints Returned to Louisiana Museum</HEAD>

   Forty rare Audubon prints stolen from the
Louisiana state museum were returned Monday by a Chicago art
gallery.
   ``I'm happy they're in the shape they're in,'' said James
Sefcik, the director of the museum. ``We'll return them to the
vaults and hope to take steps to conserve them. They need
attention.''
   Sixty prints of birds by John James Audubon were among the 108
art works stolen from the museum, which consists of eight buildings
in New Orleans, including the Presbytere in the French Quarter. The
loss was estimated at $750,000, Sefcik said. The 40 prints returned
Monday were worth about $600,000, Sefcik estimated.
   Michael Moskaluk, 43, who was a volunteer at the museum, is
being held in Vermont, charged with the theft. The state hopes to
have him extradited to Louisiana within a week, officials said.
   The package of prints arrived Friday, but Sefcik and John
Harter, the director of collections for the museum, didn't unwrap
the three packages until Monday as reporters looked on. As they
carefully went through the stacks, pictures of brown ducks, blue
jays, tiny hummingbirds almost hidden in bunches of flowers, a huge
owl, a blue heron were seen.
   ``It doesn't appear they suffered an inordinate amount of
damage,'' Sefcik said.
   The prints, which were stolen from a storage vault, were
brokered through dealers and ended up in France, Canada, Chicago,
Boston, Philadelphia and New York, Assistant Attorney General
Robert Barnett said.
   Barnett refused to identify the galleries, including the Chicago
gallery that returned the 40 prints.
   ``It's a gentlemen's agreement. They are cooperating fully and
to help them save face we won't release their names at this time,''
Barnett said.
   The Chicago gallery is still trying to recover five prints it
sold for $100,000, Barnett said. When it does, they will be
returned as well, he said.
   ``It's not very pleasant for them. They have to repurchase the
prints, plus try to save face with their customers,'' he said.
   A second Chicago gallery is expected to return four prints
within a week, Barnett said. A dealer from Philadelphia and New
York claims seven of the prints were destroyed while he was trying
to restore them, but can't document the loss, Barnett said.
   Barnett said the state is aggressively seeking the return of the
art work.
   ``We would like to have back out property. Those who don't
return it, we will pursue both civilly and criminally,'' Barnett
said.

<HEAD>Democrats Peeved About GOP Shots at Carter Over Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ghost of Jimmy Carter hangs over President
Bush's handling of the Mideast crisis _ from the former president's
preoccupation with the hostages in Iran to his call for sacrifices
by the American people.
   Bush, writes one observer, appears to be operating on a single
and so-far successful principle: ``Imagine what Jimmy Carter would
do. Then do exactly the opposite.''
   The president has refused to interrupt his vacation or promote
energy conservation with any deep conviction. For days he refused
to call trapped Westerners by their rightful name _ hostages. He
was prompt, however, when it came to flexing U.S. military muscle.
   The administration has not invoked Carter's name outright. But
White House chief of staff John Sununu _ widely believed to be the
man behind the vacation strategy _ took an unmistakable shot at him
last week.
   ``I'd rather have a president who kept the whole thing in
perspective than one who locked himself behind closed doors and
brooded about the problem,'' Sununu said.
   The comment annoyed and puzzled some Democrats.
   ``Here we've got a president in the middle of a major
international crisis and the one thing you like to have there is
bipartisan support,'' said Jody Powell, a public relations
executive who was Carter's press secretary. ``Why do you want to go
out of your way to stick your finger in someone else's eye?''
   Powell said the remark also revealed hollow motives for keeping
Bush away from Washington during the crisis. ``It's the sort of
thing you ought not come out and say,'' he said. ``It's sort of
like saying we're just doing this for show.''
   Democratic Party spokesman Mike McCurry called Sununu's comment
``a gratuitous potshot'' at a time when Democrats, including
Carter, have lined up nearly unanimously behind Bush's gulf policy.
   ``After all, a lot of the stuff Jimmy Carter tried to do in the
wake of the Iran crisis is exactly the kind of thing that might
have helped us in this particular moment, like a national energy
policy,'' McCurry said.
   Carter himself made that point recently in a long Washington
Post article with a strong ``I told you so'' undercurrent.
   The former president berated the country for wasting 17 years
since the first oil price scare and 11 years since the second
without coming up with an energy policy. ``If it is true that
Providence punishes the foolish, then we face some difficult days
indeed,'' Carter wrote.
   Some were amused, he said, when he called his drive for an
energy policy ``the moral equivalent of war.'' Now we've actually
sent U.S. troops to the Middle East, Carter said, and ``I hope that
our national response will be more sober.''
   Carter may have been prescient about the need for a national
energy policy. But his Persian Gulf record doesn't give the
Democrats much else to brag about _ which makes him, say some, an
inevitable and somewhat justifiable target.
   ``His was a failed presidency,'' said Stephen Hess, a scholar of
presidents and politics at the Brookings Institution. ``It takes a
lot not to get a second term. That doesn't mean the judgment of
historians 40 years from now will not be otherwise. But it's not as
if the Democrats are standing on the barricades saying `This is the
brilliant way that Carter did it.'''
   Joseph S. Nye Jr., director of Harvard's Center for
International Affairs and a deputy undersecretary of state during
the Carter administration, agreed that Bush is doing better than
Carter in handling a Middle East crisis.
   ``But the world is a little different. Carter was dealt lower
cards,'' Nye said.
   Bush's advantages, according to Nye and others, include the
waning of the Cold War, permitting increased military flexibility;
substantially more petroleum in the U.S. strategic reserve; a rapid
deployment force, initiated by Carter, ready to head for trouble
spots instantly; and the cooperation of a gulf state that has
sought U.S. troops.
   Given all of these assets, Nye said, it is ``a little bit
churlish'' to draw comparisons.
   Jim Hoagland, the Washington Post columnist who attributed
Bush's success thus far to doing what Carter didn't, said his
comparisons were not meant to open old wounds.
   ``Poor Carter has suffered enough for his handling of the
Iranian crisis to renew the assault now,'' he wrote, ``just as he
is establishing himself as America's only effective living
ex-president.''

<HEAD>Ratings War Brings Sex, Nudity to Brazilian Prime Time</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazilian television, which was
pretty steamy already, is filling prime time with nudity and
semi-explicit sex in a network ratings battle.
   Viewers have been favored with such wonders as an all-nude rock
band and a near-complete striptease.
   What many call the TV Sex War has inspired heated debate of
electronic eroticism and how much is too much.
   ``The pornographic use of nudity is indecent, but nudity in
itself is innocent,'' said Darcy Ribeiro, anthropologist and former
education minister. ``The ancient Greeks performed acts far more
indecent than anything seen on local TV.''
   It all started in April when Manchete TV, Brazil's third-largest
network, launched the prime-time soap opera ``Pantanal'' about a
wealthy ranching family in the vast Pantanal wetlands of central
Brazil.
   Manchete had an instant smash. For the first time, its ratings
surpassed those of Globo TV, the leading network and the world's
fourth-largest after ABC, CBS and NBC of the United States.
   ``Pantanal,'' broadcast six nights a week and scheduled to run
through December, has an excellent cast and features breathtaking
views of the wetlands.
   Was it the scenery that attracted huge audiences and started the
whole country talking? Not a chance. It was near-explicit love
scenes, the penchant of female stars for bathing in the river, the
total frontal nude of an underwater swimmer in the opening credits.
   As Manchete celebrated its success, Globo counterattacked with a
week of steamy, uncut movies running opposite the soap opera.
   Globo also unveiled, literally, popular star Claudia Raia during
a beach scene in its own prime-time soap opera ``Queen of the Junk
Yard,'' which runs just before ``Pantanal.''
   Other networks joined in.
   Silvio Santos, owner of SBT, the second-largest, broadcast a
series of literary adaptions as an alternative to the racy fare of
other channels, and said later: ``We had the worst audience ratings
in the nine years of SBT.''
   A University of Sao Paulo survey in late June counted 1,145
displays of nudity and 276 scenes of explicit or implict sex in one
week of television.
   Some viewers are outraged.
   ``We are not voyeurs, we are normal people,'' Ana Conceicao of
Rio wrote to a major newspaper. ``The scenes being shown are so raw
that explicit sex will soon be broadcast into our homes.''
   Romeu Trussardi Filho, head of the Commercial Association of Sao
Paulo, accused the networks of ``opportunism to generate higher
ratings and greater profit opportunities.''
   Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral has scheduled a meeting in
early September with station owners, writers, soap opera stars and
religious officials to discuss creation of a television code of
ethics.
   Most Brazilians seem to like the spice.
   A survey by the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo found 83 percent of
those questioned felt ``comfortable'' with the nude scenes in
``Pantanal,'' 13 percent were ``embarrassed when watching with
others'' and 4 percent were ``embarrassed when watching alone.''
   Most said they wanted as many or more nude scenes.
   ``The public likes the sex and nudity,'' said Marta Suplicy, a
psychoanalyst and author of several books on sex and culture.
``Most people have boring lives and enjoy watching others have a
good time.''
   Brazilians are used to exposed bodies, in minuscule ``tanga''
bikinis on the beaches or at the wild Carnival holiday before Lent,
but eroticism on television was limited until a new constitution
abolished all censorship in 1988.
   Coverage of Carnival heated up immediately and the Justice
Ministry asked networks to exercise restraint in live broadcasts of
semi-nude samba dancers at private clubs.
   Rosemarie Muraro, a prominent writer and feminist, said
television merely reflects the way most Brazilians view sex and
sexuality.
   ``People here are much more comfortable with their bodies than
in Anglo-Saxon countries,'' she said. ``No one even notices the
skimpy bikinis on Copacabana beach.''
   She advocated more male nudity. Most of the bare scenes on
television feature women.
   Ms. Muraro said her one concern about sex on television was that
it might increase the rate of teen pregnancy.
   Mrs. Suplicy, the psychoanalyst, said gratuitous sex scenes
``reaffirm a macho culture and sexist stereotypes,'' and could harm
younger viewers.
   ``No country in the world exposes its children to the same level
of eroticism'' on television as Brazil, she said. ``Seven-year-old
girls think about nothing but romance and seducing boys.''
   The ratings battle, like the debate, rages on.
   In late July, Globo presented ``Skid Row,'' a mystery with the
fully exposed form of actress-model Silvia Pfeifer as its main
attraction.
   Manchete struck back with ``The Song of the Mermaids,'' a
near-plotless revelation of the bare breasts of three other
actress-models.
   Critics panned ``Mermaids,'' including one who said: ``If the
show is any guide, Homer's Ulysses did not plug the ears of his
brave sailors to protect them from the mermaids' enchanting song.
It was to spare them from the stupidities they spouted.''
   The public felt otherwise. ``Mermaids'' crushed ``Skid Row'' in
viewer polls.

<TEXT>
   Abu Raed Kharwan, who
built a career as an accountant in Kuwait, now finds himself back
in the squalid Palestinian refugee camp where he was born 39 years
ago.
   ``I used to send money home,'' Kharwan said as he sat on his
father's porch, wearing a white cotton gown that is the typical
garb in the Persian Gulf region. ``Now I am a burden.''
   Kharwan and his family are among thousands of Palestinians in
the Israeli-occupied territories who face economic hardship as a
result of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   In addition to providing Palestinians with jobs, Kuwait's
contributions helped Palestinian hospitals and funded refugee aid
programs.
   Ironically, most Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip support Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whom they see as an
increasingly powerful leader capable of restoring Arab pride and
supporting their cause for independence.
   But former Kuwait resident workers like Kharwan carefully
characterize their backing of the Iraqi leader.
   ``We Palestinians are not with Saddam against Kuwait,'' he said.
``We are with Saddam against the United States.''
   Kharwan, who was on vacation in the Gaza Strip when Kuwait was
invaded, does not know when, if ever, he will be able to return to
his job. He also worries he may never see the $70,000 in savings
and pension accumulated in 14 years of work in the Persian Gulf.
   The Israeli government estimates that more than 30,000
Palestinians from the occupied territories were employed in Kuwait
at the time of Iraq's invasion. Kuwaiti businesses, banks and
offices have not reopened.
   The takeover abruptly cut off the $140 million a year that had
flowed to the territories from the Palestinian workers and Kuwaiti
government aid programs, Israeli officials said.
   Palestinian economists say workers in other Persian Gulf
countries _ whose jobs could be threatened if the turmoil spreads _
contribute an additional $160 million to the territories.
   The financial fallout goes far beyond family pocketbooks:
   _Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, the largest Palestinian-run
health facility in Gaza, has appealed to Western countries for aid
to make up for the $1 million a month Kuwait had supplied it.
   _Palestinian merchants fear their trade with Arab countries will
be disrupted. About 40 trucks of produce and products move daily
from the territories to markets in neighboring Jordan, and on to
Kuwait and Iraq.
   _There may be a shortfall in the $35 million that Persian Gulf
nations pledged to a U.N. emergency program, which provides food
and health care for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories.
   Local Palestinian activists, who insist on anonymity, say funds
clandestinely supplied to the territories by the Palestine
Liberation Organization have dried up since the Iraqi invasion.
   The PLO, closely allied with Saddam, relies on contributions
from Palestinian workers and oil-rich gulf states.
   Saeb Erakat, a West Bank professor and pro-PLO activist, warned
that the economic impact could be even greater if other gulf
countries, notably Saudi Arabia, penalize Palestinian workers
because of PLO support for Saddam.
   ``There are thousands of innocent civilians working in the gulf,
and it would be unfair to threaten their salaries or their jobs,''
Erakat said.
   He estimated the work force throughout the gulf region includes
840,000 Palestinians from the territories or from families
displaced to other Arab lands at Israel's creation in 1948.
   About 200,000 of the Palestinians currently in Kuwait do not
have passports or travel documents that allow them to return either
to the territories or other Arab nations, he said.
   ``They have no place to go and are left between the guns of the
Americans and Egyptians and the guns of Iraq,'' Erakat concluded.
The United States and Egypt, among other countries, have deployed
troops to deter further aggression by Saddam.
   Ghasan Khatib, a Palestinian economic development expert, said
families throughout the Arab world are being hurt by the sharp
decline in values of Arab currencies.
   Many Palestinians in the territories are paid in Jordanian
dinars, which have fallen 15 percent against the dollar since the
Iraqi invasion, he said. Gulf workers have savings in Kuwaiti
dinars, down 75 percent in value, and United Arab Emirates riyals,
which also have been sliding.
   For Kharwan, the Persian Gulf troubles mean he has had to move
his wife and five children into his father's stone-block Nusseirat
Camp house. Eighteen people were already living there.
   He says he has no word of the fate of two other brothers still
in Kuwait.
   In the nearby Palestinian village of Zawayda, Abu Hazen Abu
Suerieh also is worried about his future after fleeing from Kuwait,
where he worked 23 years as a port official.
   He, his wife and their six children are living without furniture
in the house he built for his retirement. Abu Suerieh, 43, said he
still hopes he will be able to return to his job in Kuwait but had
to flee the chaos of the Iraqi invasion.
   ``We couldn't get money because the banks were closed,'' he
said. ``We couldn't buy food because there were nothing left in the
stores.''

   As Iraq and the United States square off
in the Persian Gulf region, Iran is reaping economic and political
benefits from the confrontation between two countries it considers
its greatest foes.
   Since the crisis began Aug. 2, Iran's oil revenues have
skyrocketed, Iraq has withdrawn from occupied Iranian territory,
and nations that once considered Iran the regional bogeyman are
beginning to see Iraq as the main threat.
   ``The events of the past few weeks have been a godsend'' for
Iran's president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, an Asian diplomat in Iran
said.
   An official Iranian source said, ``We do find ourselves in a
comfortable position. But as a matter of principle, we
unequivocally condemn Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.''
   Both spoke on condition of anonymity in telephone interviews
from Tehran.
   The embargo on Iraq's vital oil exports has pushed up oil prices
more than 50 percent, boosting Iran's oil revenues by $33 million a
day.
   Those earnings account for more than 90 percent of Iran's hard
currency earnings, badly needed to speed up an ambitious
reconstruction launched after the August 1988 cease-fire in its war
with Iraq.
   ``The Iranians are producing oil at capacity,'' said Charles
Snow, a political analyst with the Middle East Economic Survey, a
widely respected oil market newsletter published in Nicosia. ``It's
really in their interests to keep prices as high as possible.''
   Mohammad Adeli, head of Iran's Central Bank, last week told
Tehran radio that Iran's foreign exchange earnings were up 12
percent over last year, largely due to higher oil prices.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, anxious to secure his vulnerable
eastern border with Iran while confronting the U.S-led
multinational force in Saudi Arabia, earlier this month bowed to
Tehran's demands for an Iraqi withdrawl from territory occupied in
the closing stages of the Iran-Iraq war.
   He also agreed to exchange all prisoners of war and share
sovereignty of the Shatt-al-Arab, the confluence of the Euphrates
and Tigris rivers that forms the southern boundary between Iran and
Iraq.
   Iranian officials have called the settlement Iran's ``greatest
victory'' since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in February 1979 and installed an Islamic
Republic.
   Many Arab and Western nations, including the United States,
backed Iraq in its war with Iran because they feared that
Khomeini's fundamentalist revolution would spread in the Pergion
Gulf region.
   But with Iraq now universally denounced for invading Kuwait,
``the Iranians feel vindicated,'' said Shahram Chubin, an Iran
specialist with Geneva's Graduate Institute of International
Affairs.
   ``We've benefited from higher oil prices, and the peace
settlement with Iraq. But it's just as important that other
geopolitical realities are also being realized,'' the Iranian
official said.
   ``Those countries which considered us a threat and threw their
weight behind Iraq are reassessing their policies because they
realize who the real aggressor is,'' he added.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists, has been
cautiously moving to improve relations with the West. But many
countries, especially the United States, have been wary of Iran's
intentions in the region.
   Iran has long called for the withdrawal of foreign forces and
said security in the gulf was a matter for the region itself, but
its calls have gone unheeded by gulf Arab states.
   Now that they find themselves threatened by Saddam, there may be
``an opening for Iran to act in concert with regional countries,''
Chubin noted.
   In another step in that direction, Iran offered on Sunday to
allow the thousands of foreigners who were trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait by Baghdad's invasion to flee across the Iranian border.
Turkey and Jordan, who have been receiving the bulk of the
evacuees, have threatened to close their borders.
   Although it has condemned the Iraqi invasion, Iran has
criticized the United States for deploying its forces in Saudi
Arabia and the gulf.
   ``Iran is afraid that the U.S. presence in the region may become
long-term,'' Chubin said. ``They want to make sure the foreign
military buildup is a U.N. operation, and not a U.S. one.''
   Iran has blamed Iraq for giving the United States the pretext to
massively increase its presence in the region.
   Nor does Iran have any illusions that because Saddam caved to
its demands, it can let its guard down.
   ``If Iraq is able to stay in Kuwait, then it's possible that it
will turn back and threaten Iran again,'' Chubin noted. ``Iraq will
also have frontage on the gulf and can increase its oil flow
without needing the Shatt.''
   Iran has said it will enforce the U.N.-imposed embargo on trade
with Iraq along its 730-mile border.
   The Iraqi concessions also have strengthened Rafsanjani's hand
against radical opponents, diplomats in Tehran said in telephone
interviews.
   Rafsanjani has been locked in a power struggle with anti-Western
hard-liners led by former interior minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
They oppose his policies of improving ties with the West and
tempering the revolution to concentrate on reconstruction.
   ``There's little doubt that Rafsanjani's emerged as the victor
in the power struggle,'' said the Asian diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

   The night was filled with fierce mosquitoes,
humidity thick as an invisible syrup, and the cries of a politician
railing against indolent welfare recipients.
   ``I don't mind them having illegitimate babies, ladies and
gentlemen,'' David Duke shouted to supporters at a coastal rally.
``I just don't think we should have to pay for them.''
   Duke is the head of the National Association for the Advancement
of White People, former grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, a man who once wore a swastika. They are white and
blue-collar workers, and they hope to elect him to the U.S. Senate.
   As he continued his tirade against welfare cheats and
affirmative action, they swapped horror stories of welfare abuse,
of waiting at grocery counters to buy bologna while welfare mothers
bought steaks with food stamps.
   Nearly 500 strong, they stood as one, roaring approval, when he
talked of working for benefits and competing for jobs on merit.
When he charged that the liberals in Washington had sold working
men and women down the river, many responded with open yells that
``the niggers are taking over.''
   Duke, a boyish-looking 40, was elected last year to the
Louisiana House from the New Orleans suburbs. His bills aimed at
welfare and affirmative action have met with no success, but he has
proven himself an articulate spokesman for the far right. His fans
regard him as more than a messenger; they see him as a savior.
   ``Duke's the only chance we've got to let America know we're
tired of those lazy bastards collecting checks,'' a woman yelled
over the din of a typical Duke rally.
   ``We want people to get off their ass and go to work,'' said an
elderly postmaster in a tiny rural community who showed up to hear
Duke in central Louisiana. ``We've got to have someone stand up for
us. We're paying the tab for the coloreds. Even our president is a
nigger-lover.''
   Duke drew widespread attention in 1973 when as a university
student he demonstrated in a Nazi uniform against anti-war
protesters. Later in the 1970s, he took off his hood as the
persuasive head of the Klan.
   He was accused of trying to sell secret Klan membership lists,
and in 1980 he left the KKK and formed the NAAWP. In the next few
years, he ran unsuccessfully for a state Senate seat, wrote for a
living and operated a bookstore.
   He defeated the brother of former Republican Gov. Dave Treen for
a state House seat in 1989 and only a few months later started
talking about the U.S. Senate race.
   The national GOP has repudiated Duke's candidacy and let out a
collective groan when he opened a Washington office under the
auspices of a group called Republican Action for the 90s. ``The
Duke Revolution of the '90s will collapse liberalism at home,'' the
group said in a letter to conservatives.
   While Duke builds steam, U.S. Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., has
barely launched his re-election campaign and state Sen. Ben Bagert
_ the designated Republican nominee _ is a distant third, despite
appearances with Ollie North and Robert Bork.
   A recent poll for television stations gave Johnston 52 percent
of the voters' support, Duke 24 percent and Bagert 7 percent.
   All three and another three unknowns will compete Oct. 6 in an
open primary. Professional political consultants say Duke has a
good shot at keeping Johnston below 50 percent and thereby forcing
a runoff in November, but they say ultimately he won't be able to
overcome the three-term Senate veteran.
   Johnston has urged voters to avoid a runoff, saying it would
attract even more undesirable national attention to the state.
   ``It matters what people outside Louisiana think,'' said
Johnston. ``We don't want people to think we're like South Africa.
People don't invest their money there.''
   Gus Weill, the dean of Louisiana's political consultants,
attributed much of Duke's appeal to the state's ailing economy.
   ``In Louisiana, we are absolutely in hard times and Duke has
presented us with a villain _ black people,'' Weill said. ``He'll
get support that will surprise some people, but there aren't enough
callous people in this state to elect him.''
   Linus Juneau, head of the American Legion in tiny Bordelonville,
predicted a large number of World War II veterans will back Duke.
``People like what he says about giveaways,'' he said. ``They're
not concerned about the past.''
   Duke has spent more than $1.2 million so far to convince voters
that he repudiates the ``reckless past of my youth. I was
intolerant. I'm ashamed of that.'' He stresses in every appearance
that his past is dead.
   There are indications, however, that Duke has not undergone a
complete transformation. As late as 1989, his bookstore still was
selling pro-Nazi literature. And on a television talk show this
month, he was asked about racial songs _ including one called
``Some Niggers Never Die'' _ that he recently sold in his
bookstore. He called them humorous.
   The Rev. James Stovall, chairman of the Louisiana Coalition
Against Racism and Nazism, said Duke's remarks prove he is ``still
a bigot and a hater.''
   Whatever he is, Duke believes he is speaking for millions. ``You
may think my message is just mine,'' he told one audience. ``But
what I'm saying openly is what the other politicians are saying in
private. If a man with my past can be elected to the U.S. Senate,
more politicians will follow and America will be heard.''

<HEAD>Is Gulf Crisis Changing Chances for Auto Workers Strike?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growing economic uncertainty from the Mideast
crisis has complicated the United Auto Workers' effort to get an
improved contract from the Big Three automakers.
   Some industry analysts watching the union-management maneuvering
say the Mideast element could toughen the UAW's demands for job
security as it gets into intensive bargaining. Others say the
chances for a strike by the UAW are shrinking.
   In the oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s, U.S. automakers
marketed big cars that burned so much gasoline they lost customers
to the Japanese, who wooed the U.S. market with small, gas-sippers
that became immediate hits.
   Since then, Japanese automakers have chewed away at the Big
Three's collective market share and now account for about 30
percent. The Big Three have battled back, but GM, Ford and Chrysler
executives say competition is the toughest it's ever been.
   The UAW entered bargaining with General Motors Corp., Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. in mid-July, saying job security would be
the overriding issue. More than 450,000 workers are covered by
contracts that expire Sept. 14.
   The UAW leadership, which will meet Tuesday in Detroit, have
said they plan to concentrate on agreement with a target company _
expected to be GM _ then use that accord as a pattern for contracts
at the other two automakers.
   Last week, UAW and company bargainers said mention of the
Mideast situation arose at bargaining tables, but it hadn't
dominated discussions.
   Before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, auto analyst Ronald
Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. of San Francisco said a
two-week UAW strike against GM was likely.
   Glantz held fast to his position Friday, as the Gulf crisis
worsened and the government reported a lackluster 1.2 percent
increase in second-quarter economic growth.
   Because of economic threats stemming from the Mideast crisis,
Glantz said, ``Workers are saying, `I'm more determined to get job
security.'
   But Scott Merlis, who follows the auto industry for Morgan,
Stanley &amp; Co. of New York, has come to a much different conclusion.
   ``I think on the margin it creates a more conciliatory position
at the bargaining table,'' he said. ``I think (UAW) leadership
probably recognizes the threats and the union remembers the harm an
energy crisis can do to the industry.''

   Children don't play outside here in the
summer, and they go to school armed. Nearly everyone is enlisted in
the battle against Public Enemy No. 1 _ mosquitoes.
   Williston, located at the confluence of the Missouri and
Yellowstone rivers, is a kind of mosquito mecca. The rivers create
an ideal breeding ground for hundreds of thousands of the insects.
   ``They're bad,'' says 23-year-old Kellee Cox, who moved to the
area from Fargo last spring. ``I can't believe it. I've got a
million mosquito bites.
   ``I went into my back yard and got swarmed with them,'' she
says, revealing dozens of irritated red bites on her arms. ``They
just swarmed over me and attacked me like killer bees.''
   It isn't a new problem; explorers Lewis and Clark complained
about the bugs during their brief visits to the rivers' confluence
in 1805 and 1806. A historian called a mosquito attack of 1947 the
worst on record.
   Some say the mosquitoes enjoy the predominantly Norwegian blood
of the town's 13,000 residents. Others have proposed getting rid of
the bugs by building a bubble over the town or setting up huge fans
to blow them away.
   For years several agencies, including the impressive-sounding
Vector Control District board, labored unsuccessfully to put down
the insect uprising. ``Too many people were running the same
program,'' says Bill Cole, chairman of the vector board. ``Things
weren't getting done.''
   But a new idea emerged from a heated city meeting last summer at
which residents were challenged to come up with their own ideas for
mosquito control.
   Two housewives joined a pediatrician, two teachers and the owner
of a day care center to form the Bug Busters _ a volunteer group
that studied ways to control the pests while protecting the
environment.
   They enlisted the local high school, a woodworking club and the
Army Corps of Engineers to make about two dozen mini-houses along
the river, each designed to attract bats and sparrows _ natural
mosquito predators.
   ``We're not importing bats or anything like that,'' said Bug
Buster Jackie Stenehjem. ``The bats are already here. We're just
hoping they'll move out of town and move into the houses along the
river.''
   Before the Bug Busters, the spraying of newly discovered larvae
had to be approved by several agencies, taking up to a week. Now
the decisions are in local hands and extermination can start within
10 minutes.
   In April, voters approved an annual fee of $12 per household to
help bolster mosquito control.
   Despite a rough week or two, this summer generally was better
than last. But children still stay mostly indoors and when they
they go to school, they take cans of bug repellent with their
pencils and notebooks.
   Residents try to make the best of the bug situation, which they
recognize is an unwinnable war.
   ``It's a numbers game we're playing,'' Cole said. ``We just want
to get it down to where it's livable.''

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Crisis Sure to Spark New Debate Over Environmental
Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists digging in for a new assault
on what they consider sacrosanct energy reserves as threatened oil
shortages and rising gasoline prices spurred by the Persian Gulf
crisis start biting into American pocketbooks.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was only a few days old when Sen.
Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, persuaded colleagues to approve a
measure that would make it easier to expand oil drilling on federal
land, bypassing some environmental restrictions.
   The oil industry was just as quick to call for abandoning recent
curbs on offshore oil drilling, relaxing requirements for cleaner
burning gasoline and drilling in some environmentally sensitive
areas.
   Although neither Murkowski's nor any of the other proposals has
won final congressional approval, environmentalists fear an
intensified push by industry to win relief from hard-fought
environmental gains when Congress returns from summer recess after
Labor Day.
   ``Now that we're on the verge of another major national debate
on energy policy, we're about to be deluged with a lot of bad
ideas,'' Marc Ledbetter of the American Council for an
Energy-Efficient Economy said in a recent interview.
   Ledbetter and other environmentalists worry that the debate will
be fueled by renewed declarations that the United States depends
too much on imported oil from the Middle East and thus may be too
ready to commit troops to fight for it.
   The oil companies are trying to use the Middle East crisis to
get Congress to ``push the panic button'' and wipe out 20 years of
public lands protection, complained Peter A. Berle, president of
the National Audubon Society.
   There is also concern that the latest oil price shocks will
complicate final clean air legislation.
   Some industry spokesmen are suggesting that skyrocketing oil
prices, the threat of armed conflict and a declining economy argue
against imposing expensive new environmental controls that
eventually will cost at least $20 billion a year.
   ``We must respect the environment, but can't afford to continue
keeping rich U.S. energy potential under lock and key when we're
sending young Americans overseas to protect western oil
interests,'' Richard Seibert, vice president of the National
Association of Manufacturers, said last week.
   Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said the Middle East crisis should ``wake people up'' to the need
to balance environmental protection and economic cost.
   These arguments are nothing new, said Michael McCloskey,
chairman of the Sierra Club. He recalled the ``dreadful times''
after oil shocks in 1973 and 1979 when environmental programs were
under similar attack.
   ``The oil companies are now trying to get the American people to
believe that our country needs to sacrifice its public lands so
that it can pump its way out of today's oil disruption,'' he said.
   But McCloskey and other environmentalists say the Middle East
crisis also points out the need for more energy conservation and
less use of fossil fuels. The burning of fossil fuels is a major
cause of global warming and urban pollution.
   Last week a group of environmentalists called for new energy
conservation efforts, including passage of a Senate bill to
dramatically boost auto fuel efficiency requirements.
   Environmentalists say that while the current situation may
clarify how far Americans are willing to support environmental
protection, they believe their movement can fend off any attacks.
   ``There will be some old battles reopened by the oil companies
especially, but I'm quite confident that the environmental
positions are going to prevail,'' Christopher Flavin of the
Worldwatch Institute said in a recent interview. ``The American
people will not abandon environmental issues.''
   The Bush administration has given no indication that it will
reverse its recent decision to curtail offshore oil development
along vast stretches of U.S. coastline for at least the next decade.
   There also is no clear sign that Congress is prepared to go
along with the oil industry and open the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge for drilling, or to scuttle major sections of the proposed
clean air legislation.
   But Energy Secretary James Watkins said recently he would seek
to resolve a longstanding dispute between Chevron Corp. and the
state of California over pumping oil from two existing offshore
wells near Santa Barbara. And the White House renewed its call to
open the arctic refuge to exploratory drilling.

<HEAD>Terrorized Colombian Judge Flees Bench Seeking Asylum in United

<TEXT>
   The day a voice on the telephone
invited Colombian judge Clara Parra to her own funeral, she knew it
was time to get out.
   The judge _ who worked in a ``red zone,'' so designated because
of drug-trafficking and guerrilla violence _ packed her bags,
collected her 16-year-old son and left for Massachusetts. She is
now seeking asylum in the United States.
   Unlike most defections, Parra's has the support of the country
she fled.
   ``Her career as a judge and as a lawyer in Colombia is almost
finished, so we need her to be a legal citizen in the United
States,'' Colombian Consul Bertha Ospina said.
   ``We're not asking for money or anything like that. We're asking
only for permission for her family and her to live here with legal
permission so she could work.''
   Ospina wrote a letter from the Boston consulate to U.S.
authorities in support of the asylum request, and a hearing has
been set for Oct. 5.
   Parra, a municipal judge in Guamal, Colombia, who had been on
the bench since 1985, said the threatening calls began in January
1989.
   ``In April of this year I received a last call by which I was
invited to my funeral on May 5th, whereupon I could not bear it any
longer,'' she wrote in her petition for asylum filed in July.
   ``I asked what they wanted. They never answered,'' Parra, 41,
said in a recent interview. She said she doesn't know who
threatened her _ she issued dozens of search warrants and detention
orders against drug traffickers and guerrillas _ and still wonders
how the callers got her unlisted phone numbers.
   ``I lost confidence in everybody,'' she said.
   Drug lords in Colombia have threatened to kill 10 judges for
every trafficker extradited to the United States, and more than 200
judges have been killed as Colombia stepped up law enforcement
efforts, Ospina said.
   It's unusual for a country to back one of its citizens in a
quest for asylum elsewhere, immigration officials said.
   ``If the Colombian government wants to go on record that the
individual would be subject to persecution on return to that
country then we would have to take that under consideration,'' said
Timothy Whelan, deputy district director for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   Parra is seeking U.S. residency for herself and her son, as well
as for an older son sent to study in Texas before the death
threats. She went to western Massachusetts because she has
relatives there.
   Eighteen-year-old Mauricio Parra said his mother did the right
thing.
   ``They tell you that they're going to kill you. Sooner or later
they're going to do it,'' he said.

   Ten years ago, warriors of the Krahn
tribe led a bloody campaign of revenge against Liberians descended
from American slaves, who had ruled the country since it was
founded in 1847.
   Now the Krahn, and their allies of the Mandingo tribe, are
themselves being hunted in a tribal war waged without mercy.
   Members of the Krahn tribe kill people of other tribes, and the
others kill Krahn, solely because of tribal allegiances.
   Descendants of the freed slaves brought here early in the 19th
century by American civil rights groups are known as
American-Liberians. Their forbears organized the True Whig Party,
which ruled without interruption, and American-Liberians were
widely accused of brutalizing the native inhabitants.
   A revolution in 1980 led by Samuel Doe brought an end to their
rule.
   President William Tolbert was killed in his executive mansion on
April 12, 1980. A week later, 13 of Tolbert's ministers and heads
of government corporations were executed in public, tied to stakes
on the Atlantic beach near the mansion.
   The coup and subsequent executions were the work of Doe and 16
other non-commissioned officers from the Krahn homeland, Grand
Gedeh County, in the distant eastern interior. Many were illiterate
and had never been in touch with civilized life.
   Liberia's new rulers appeared to have no sense of money, and the
result was economic disaster.
   American-Liberians kept a low profile. Their standard of living
often dropped to the level of their tribal compatriots.
   Since they had no tribe of their own, they became known
collectively as the Congo tribe. Congo was a popular term at the
time of the U.N. operation to save the former Belgian Congo, now
Zaire, from chaos.
   A part of Monrovia is known today as Congo Town, after the
American-Liberians who settled there.
   After Doe's coup, the Krahn were the masters. The Masonic temple
that dominated Monrovia, once the place where the major decisions
were made, became a ransacked shell.
   The national motto, ``The Love of Freedom Brought Us Here,'' was
an insult to native tribes, but none of the Krahn in authority
thought to change it.
   Doe ran the country like a private estate. The army commander,
Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, attempted a coup in 1985 and was
killed.
   Popular dissatisfaction with Doe's rule grew and, in 1989,
tribes that had suffered under the Krahn-Mandingo oppression
rebeled.
   Most American-Liberians remained on the sidelines, but one of
them, Charles Taylor, sought to lead the rebellion.
   Taylor and his lieutenant, Prince Johnson, had spent four years
in Libya being trained in military tactics and indoctrinated in the
``green book'' ideology of Moammar Gadhafi. Libya still is Taylor's
main arms supplier.
   Most of Taylor's followers are from aboriginal tribes and he has
tried to shake off his Congo tribe background.
   Johnson, of the Gio tribe, broke with Taylor after an argument
over the execution of several rebels Johnson accused of desertion.
Johnson had the deserters shot and Taylor has been his sworn enemy
ever since.
   Generally, unlike Taylor, Johnson has tried to humanize the
conflict. He distributed food to civilians, ordered men of his
executed for looting and insisted he was fighting only to remove
Doe from power.
   ``As soon as this war is over, I and my men are returning to
barracks,'' he says repeatedly. Civilians tend to believe him.
   Taylor has fought with the same brutality as Doe. Unlike the
other two contestants, he refused to have anything to do with a
peace force of West African states, and said he would fight the
peacekeepers if they arrived.
   Then Johnson and Doe concluded a truce, to unite against Taylor,
laying the foundation for an even longer civil war.
   The five-nation West African force arrived Friday night, was
welcomed by Prince Johnson and, according to the Ghana news agency,
repulsed an attack on Saturday by rebels loyal to Taylor.
   Countless atrocities have been reported in the many months of
fighting, many of them attributed to Doe's Krahn warriors. Up to
400 people were killed Aug. 5 in a night attack on Gio refugees
sheltering in St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Monrovia.
   U.S. Marines were sent to protect the U.S. Embassy, but were
instructed to stay out of the general conflict.
   To many Liberians, however, the United States is their only hope
of rescue from destruction. They look to America as their country's
founder.
   ``America is my fatherland,'' said Johnson, whose personal
experience of the United States is minimal. ``We expect the
Americans to come to our help as the French came to the help of
Gabon, or the British to the help of Uganda.''

   U.N. officials making their first formal effort to mediate the
Persian Gulf crisis announced Sunday they will meet this week with
Iraqi officials, and Iraq allowed 52 dependents of captive U.S.
diplomats to flee to Turkey.
   Sunday's announcement came a day after the world body authorized
the use of force to back international economic sanctions on Iraq.
   Iraq freed 52 of 55 dependents of American diplomats evacuated
last week from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait who had been detained in
Baghdad. But Iraqi officials kept other U.S. citizens as hostages
to deter any American attack.
   The group left Baghdad by car and crossed into Turkey at the
Habur border post about 2 a.m. Monday, State Department officials
in Washington said.
   They were met by officials from the U.S. Embassy in Ankara.
``They were all very, very tired but they were all very
enthusiastic, very happy to be in Turkey,'' embassy vice consul
David Kostelancik said from Diyarbakir.
   But three young men, sons of U.S. diplomats assigned to Kuwait,
were turned back at the border with Turkey, a State Department
spokeswoman said. The three, all over age 18, sent back to Baghdad,
she said.
   Kostelancik said the rest of the group was heading for the
Interlik air base near Adana. He said it will remain there until
leaving Turkey for the United States, probably on Tuesday.
   U.S. Embassy personnel from Kuwait were detained in Baghdad and
Iraq says they will not be freed until the mission in Kuwait city
has closed.
   United Nations chief Javier Perez de Cuellar will meet Thursday
in Jordan with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz ``to engage in a
full exchange of views on the crisis,'' said the
secretary-general's spokeswoman, Nadia Younes.
   It would be the first formal U.N. attempt to mediate the crisis,
which began when Iraqi President Saddam Hussein sent his troops
into Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed the country in a dispute over
land and oil.
   The action led to a trade embargo against Iraq and a huge,
U.S.-led troop deployment to protect neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   Aziz said in Baghdad on Sunday that he planned to meet with
Perez de Cuellar this week, but he did not elaborate. He declined
to say whether Iraq was prepared to compromise on Kuwait's status.
   ``We are open to listen to suggestions,'' Aziz told CNN.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said Sunday in
Washington that the Bush administration ``would have no problem''
with a mediation effort by Perez de Cuellar.
   But Scowcroft said the United States wants Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait. After that, he said, ``We're prepared to talk about
anything.''
   Meanwhile in the Persian Gulf, U.S. warships shadowed Iraqi
vessels but did not immediately exercise their newly won authority
to stop them by force.
   The Soviet Union said its ships will not use force to uphold
trade sanctions. Moscow, however, played a key role in the passage
of the U.N. resolution allowing military enforcement of the Iraqi
trade sanctions.
   For a second day, skeleton crews at embassies in Kuwait City
defied an Iraqi order to close their missions. Iraq surrounded the
U.S. and other compounds with soldiers and cut off their services
but did not resort to force.
   In other developments:
   _The U.S. Army on Sunday ordered 50 more Army reserve and
National Guard units in 25 states to report for active duty by Aug.
31. The callup on Friday of Air National Guard Reserve units from
six states began a national mobilization of reserves authorized by
President Bush.
   _Three weeks after the United States began sending troops to the
gulf region to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraqi aggression,
sources in Washington estimated that 60,000 U.S. soldiers, airmen
and sailors were deployed.
   _Several days after Jordan and Turkey said they may have to
close their borders to refugees from Iraq and Kuwait, Iran said it
would allow evacuees to pass through its territory to freedom.
   _Pope John Paul II, in his first public condemnation of Iraqi
actions, criticized human rights violations and prayed for the
foreign hostages.
   The American women and children freed by Iraq left Baghdad in a
13-car convoy for the Turkish border, according to Carole Lee
Heileman, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara.
   ``An additional 54 or 55 personnel, mostly men, who had been
stationed in Kuwait are still in Baghdad and we have not secured
their release,'' she said.
   Iraq last week ordered nations to close their embassies in
Kuwait, claiming that the oil-rich nation was now part of Iraq.
   The United States sent about 110 diplomats and dependents to
Baghdad. They were stranded there when Saddam reversed an earlier
promise and said they would be detained until the United States
closed its embassy in Kuwait.
   Iraq's U.S. ambassador, Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat, said Saturday
that the U.S. diplomats must remain in Bagdhad ``because they don't
have diplomatic status.''
   In all, about 21,000 Westerners have been caught in Iraq and
Kuwait, including 3,000 Americans. Iraq says some have been
distributed among Iraqi strategic sites for use as human shields to
deter a U.S. attack.
   Iraq continues to round up Westerners from their homes in Kuwait
City. Britain and France each said Iraqi troops detained eight of
their nationals. They said the British were moved to an
unidentified ``civilian establishment,'' while the French were
placed in a hotel.
   In Washington, State Department press officer Anita Stockman
said the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait has been told two additional
Americans were detained by Iraqi troops. Dozens of Americans have
been rounded up in Iraq and Kuwait and moved to undisclosed
locations.
   In the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, more than two dozen U.S.
warships continued to keep Iraqi vessels under surveillance Sunday.
   The U.N. Security Council on Saturday authorized military action
to enforce the trade embargo on Iraqi commerce, especially its oil
exports.
   U.S. officials have said the United States and its allies can
now use force to disable vessels, by wrecking the rudders of ships
breaking the embargo.
   Although two U.S. warships have fired warning shots over the bow
of two Iraqi oil tankers, Iraq may retaliate militarily if its
vessels are hit.
   Asked for an update Sunday on activity in the Persian Gulf, Navy
spokesman Chris Baumann said only that U.S. ships were tracking
``numerous'' vessels, as they had been for several days. ``There is
no action,'' he said.

   ``The ordinary person, even the ordinary
politician, has a difficult time distinguishing a prison from a
jail.''
   It's a difference Howard Safir had to explain over and over for
the last 12 years. As operations director of the U.S. Marshals
Service, Safir was responsible for finding jail cells _ not prison
cells _ for federal inmates.
   Safir, who recently retired, got them from the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons or leased them from other governments.
   The U.S. Justice Department uses jails differently from the
states, counties and cities.
   Federal jail cells house only individuals who have been denied
bail while they await trial or for those convicted but awaiting
sentencing.
   State and local jails do that, too. But they also hold
individuals serving short misdemeanor sentences. The federal
government sends such convicts to low-security prisons and prison
camps.
   Many states now also keep some more serious offenders in jails,
because their prisons are overcrowded.
   Marshals, lawyers and judges agree that the most efficient jails
are connected by secure tunnel or bridge to the courthouse where
the inmates are tried.
   ``A prison in a cornfield works fine. A jail doesn't,'' Safir
said. ``Because jail inmates have to go to court each day. They
need access to their lawyers. They are almost all still not-guilty
prisoners under our system. They have more rights than convicts.''

   The arrival of powerful U.S. military
forces in the Persian Gulf has strongly bolstered the immediate
security of many prosperous oil states.
   But some analysts say the U.S. forces could become liabilities
the longer they stay, and that gulf states truly interested in more
security may have to change their government structures to rally
more long-term popular support.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, who has invited the bulk of the U.S.
forces onto the territory of his conservative Islamic nation, has
said repeatedly that their presence will be temporary. They will
leave as soon as Saudi Arabia no longer faces the threat of
invasion from Iraq, according to the king.
   But it was a fundamental change in policy to invite non-Moslem
military forces into Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, and
sensitivies in the area about foreign forces are high.
   ``The American military presence is friendly at least for the
time being and until the Iraqi danger is repulsed and crushed,''
said Jassem Murad, a former Bahraini parliament deputy.
   ``But if the Americans try to prolong their stay in the gulf,
they would be regarded as enemies worthy of nothing less than
denunciation.''
   Murad contended that gulf governments ``will have to revive and
encourage the incipient democratization movements, reconsider the
distribution of their countries' wealth and institute a foolproof
system of social justice.''
   Over the past two decades, Kuwait has had, off and on, the only
freely elected parliament in the Arab world. It was suspended twice
_ in 1976 and in 1986 _ because of alleged abuses by radical
deputies.
   Elsewhere in the region, no government has been willing to
facilitate the democratic process. Saudi Arabia has promised, but
never established, an Islamic constituent body known as a Shura
consultative council. Bahrain's three-year democratic experience
ended in the dissolution of parliament in 1975. Other countries in
the region, without exception, remain under dynastic rule with no
elected constituent institutions.
   Some Saudi Arabians, however, seem to care little about
democracy or a formal redisribution of oil wealth.
   ``What's democracy? Western-style is only a farce,'' said Mutlaq
al-Assiri, a merchant in Jiddah. ``Our leaders are incomparably
benevolent. They protect our faith, build us roads and give our
sons jobs. We can see any of our top leaders anytime we desire at
majlis (consultative meetings) and air our grievances. Education is
free through university, medical care is free and ours is the
safest land.''
   Fahd and his predecessors spent hundreds of billions of dollars
to transform Saudi Arabia into a modern country, with a vast
network of roads, light industries, schools and hospitals.
   Many people seem to have ambivalent feelings about the American
military presence. The Iraq of Saddam Hussein has accused the
Saudis of encouraging the massive U.S. deployment, but other Arabs
blame Iraq itself.
   ``The Saudis did not bring the Americans to the gulf,'' said
Malek al-Saghir, a restaurant owner in the gulf sheikdom of Dubai.
   ``Saddam forced the Americans to deploy in the gulf twice in
this decade, once when he invaded Iran and again when he invaded
Kuwait.''
   Some say the Americans should have acted sooner.
   ``The Americans are to blame for all the tragedies Saddam has
precipitated,'' said Murad. ``They knew him long before his rabid
aggression (against Kuwait) _ when he invaded Iran, violated human
rights of his own citizens, and used chemical weapons to burn the
Kurds in northern Iraq.''
   ``The Americans and the Arabs saw in Saddam a war criminal and
ruthless dictator. Why didn't they stop him? Why did they appease
him?
   Many commentators agree that the longer U.S. forces remain, the
less hospitable Arabs will be to them.
   Said Medhat Sadeq, general manager of the Bahrain-based Arab
Financial Services Company: ``In the foreseeable future, it is good
to have American forces in the gulf. But if these forces stay
longer than necessary, the old anti-Western sentiments will resume
among Arab masses.''
   Initially, the Saudis were discreet about the U.S. military
influx. They slammed their gates shut to journalists.
   But apparently at American behest, the Saudis later allowed
increasing numbers of foreign journalists to enter. And a senior
gulf official told reporters accompanying U.S. Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney ``everyone is accepting there's going to be a long-term
presence.''
   Many gulf-based Arab diplomats speculate the United States is in
for a very long stay.
   ``I'm confident the Saudis won't relent until the al-Sabah
family is reinstated and the Iraqi tyrant is crippled,' said one
Arab diplomat, referring the Kuwaiti ruling family deposed by the
invading Iraqis.
   ``And, when reinstated, the al-Sabahs will have to implore the
Americans to maintain some kind of military presence in Kuwait, as
a protection against the eventuality of aggression by either Iraq
or Iran,'' said the diplomat, who insisted on anonymity.
   ``I hope the stay of foreign forces in the gulf will not be very
long,'' a former British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Sir James
Craig, said in a telephone interview. ``A long stay could swing the
public opinion in the West against the military role in the gulf.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY:Image-Makers See Risk as Bush Golfs Through Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Americans recall the gulf crisis of
August 1990, they'll picture their president in a golf cart and a
motorboat _ images that some Democrats are mentally stockpiling for
their 1992 campaign arsenal.
   Why does the White House permit President Bush, the nation's
best-known vacationer, to be photographed talking about troops,
tensions, hostages and hardships while he's fishing or golfing?
   ``It's over-compensation. It's an attempt to prove that George
Bush and Iraq are not Jimmy Carter and Iran,'' said GOP analyst
Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Political Report.
   But he and others suggest that Bush could have made the same
point in a less jarring way by taking a working vacation at Camp
David, for example, or by limiting his activities in Maine to a
morning run, relaxation with his family and work related to the
crisis.
   ``Virtually every night we see the guy in his little golf
cart,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ``If he's going to
be in Kennebunkport, you want him on the phone _ not on the links.''
   To the image-makers, Bush is committing a cardinal sin and
taking a potential risk.
   ``What you need when you're the president is a lot of personal
credibility to get you over the rough spots,'' said Bob Squier, a
Democratic media consultant. ``This operation is not going to be
easy. He's squandering his goodwill by giving pictures that make it
look like he's not taking this seriously.''
   Bush defends his decision to ``play and play hard _ and then
work like hell the rest of the time.''
   ``What you don't want to do is appear to be held hostage in the
White House to events,'' he said.
   But Jody Powell, who was Carter's press secretary, said Bush
runs the risk of being ``the first American president who's ever
been held hostage in a cigarette boat. He can't come back to the
White House even if he wants to.''
   Political analysts, invoking the public relations masters of the
Reagan White House, say Bush is sending mixed signals.
   There is Bush using his boat and golf cart while calling on
Americans to conserve energy. There is Bush in casual clothes,
fishing or golfing, flashing on the TV screen seconds after footage
of U.S. troops on warships and in the Saudi desert.
   And, perhaps most jolting, there is Bush answering questions on
grave matters from the seat of his boat or golf cart.
   ``He ought to be giving pictures that go with his words,'' said
Squier. ``He's being tough, he's being presidential, he's being the
commander-in-chief. The pictures he gives are of this kind of hack
golfer or gas-guzzling speedboat monster.''
   Democrats admit that the golf and fishing footage may be
insignificant in a political campaign if Bush's diplomatic and
military policies succeed.
   ``If everything turns out all right, the fact that Bush dealt
with this from Kennebunkport won't matter,'' said Garin.
``Everybody's going to be celebrating the Bush style.''
   But some say the vacation pictures could be effective if, for
example, the gulf crisis turns into a protracted standoff that
damages the domestic economy and makes Bush vulnerable in general.
   ``You can imagine the Democratic arguments,'' said Rothenberg.
``He was on furlough when the reserves were being called up.''
   While Squier has been outspoken about the possible impact of the
boating and golf images in a 1992 presidential race, the official
Democratic Party line is that such speculation is inappropriate now.
   Party spokesman Mike McCurry said no one at the Democratic
National Committee is stockpiling Bush vacation footage for
political purposes. But he acknowledged that its potential has not
escaped notice.
   With all the hardships in store for the families of soldiers and
reservists, McCurry said, ``no one wants to think that politicians
are out there calculating the odds. But they do and that's a fact
of life.''

<HEAD>Ice Cream Exports Booming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. dairy exporters are discovering that
consumers in foreign countries appreciate a big scoop of ice cream
on a hot day as much as Americans.
   Over the last five years ice cream exports have tripled,
reaching $9.4 million worth last year, according to an article in
the Agriculture Department's latest AGExporter magazine.
   The more developed a nation is the better the chance of selling
it ice cream, said David Young and Ron Verdonk, authors of the
article.
   It's important, for example, that most of the country's
residents have refrigerators with freezers for the nation to be a
truly fertile market.
   ``With close to 1.4 billion gallons produced and annual per
capita consumption of 45 pints, the United States is still its own
best customer and the largest single market for ice cream
worldwide,'' according to the magazine.
   But other developed nations, particularly the booming and
burgeoning economies of the Pacific Rim in Asia are potential hot
markets for frozen dessert.
   ``In the case of a product like ice cream, it is important to
work on familiarizing consumers in potential foreign markets with
the joys of consumption,'' advise Young and Verdonk.
   The major markets and the amount of ice cream imported last year
were Hong Kong, $2.6 million worth; Bermuda, $1 million; and
Mexico, $700,000. As regions, top buyers were the Far East, $3.6
million, the Caribbean, $2.3 million and the European Community,
$1.7 million.
   ``Given the hot climate and large numbers of U.S. and European
tourists, the Caribbean market is a natural one for U.S. ice
cream,'' said the authors. ``Sales in this region have grown in
tandem with the increases in tourism revenues.''
   They said exports there almost tripled from 1985 to 1989. In
Bermuda, purchase grew from virtually nothing a few years ago to $1
million in 1989.
   Exports of U.S. yogurt are showing the same rapid growth as ice
cream, said Young and Verdonk.

   U.S. commercial red meat production in July
totaled 3.1 billion pounds, up 2 percent from the same month last
year.
   However, slaughter was down 1 percent at 22.2 billion pounds for
the full first seven months of the year compared to 1989, the
Agriculture Department reports.
   For the period from January through July, beef slaughter was
down slightly compared with the previous year; veal, down 12
percent; pork, down 3 percent; lamb and mutton, up 8 percent.
   The July-July comparisons, with 1989 first, are as follows.
   _Beef, 1.88 billion pounds; 1.93 billion.
   _Veal, 27 million; 26 million.
   _Pork, 1.10 billion; 1.10 billion.
   _Lamb and mutton, 25 million; 28 million.
   The Agriculture Department says that cattle and hog prices are
declining from recent highs as red meat supplies increase
seasonally.
   Pork production will rise through mid-fall, resulting in further
price declines. Large fed cattle marketings, at heavier weights
will be partially offset by a less than seasonal increase in cow
slaughter, says USDA.

   The United States and other nations that
donate food are putting more emphasis on the needs of recipient
countries and less on their own domestic concerns, such as getting
rid of surplus commodities, say two USDA economists.
   Since the early 1970s, the principal donors have been the United
States, Canada and the European Community, with wheat and wheat
products constituting about 83 percent of the tonnage shipped.
   Other products include coarse grains, rice, vegetable oils,
beans and fish. In the late 1980s, the United States and EC reduced
dairy product surpluses and consequently the giveaways.
   ``Over the years, food aid has grown more humanitarian,'' said
the economists, Shahla Shapouri and Margaret Missiaen.
   ``Also there has been an expansion of multilateral programs in
which organizations such as the World Food Program of the United
Nations jointly help distressed nations,'' they said.
   The researchers, who studied donations in 1975 and 1985, found
more aid was given in the latter year and more widely dispersed.
Major recipients in 1985 were in Africa instead of South Asia, they
said.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has ravaged the
Hollywood of the Middle East, depriving Egypt's film industry of
the Kuwaiti money that keeps the reels turning.
   Producers, actors and directors in the region's largest film
industry watch with worry as each day of occupation costs them
thousands of dollars in lost ticket revenues and financial backing.
   And next to suffer may be the movie-going public.
   ``For Arabs, Egyptian films are the main source of
entertainment,'' said Munib Shafei, chairman of the Egyptian
Chamber for Movie Industries. ``And this invasion has caused severe
problems for our industry.''
   Egyptian studios have been the center of Arabic movie-making for
six decades and produce an average of 60 films annually. About 80
percent of foreign financial backing for the films comes from the
Arab oil states of the Persian Gulf, mainly Kuwait.
   Before Iraq's the Aug. 2 conquest of Kuwait, that small state
was the main distribution center for the Persian Gulf, which under
the Egyptian industry's production system meant they also were
co-producers.
   Before production, Kuwaiti entrepreneurs bought distribution
rights to an Egyptian film. The Egyptian filmmaker then used that
money to help produce his film, which the Kuwaiti backers
subsequently distributed under a leasing arrangement with
exhibitors in neighboring states.
   ``It's a unique situation. The distributor is effectively a
co-producer,'' said Mustafa Gamal-el-Din, a director. Persian Gulf
distributors financed a third and sometimes up to three-fourths of
a film's production costs, he said.
   Egyptian films typically feature maudlin love stories,
far-fetched intrigue and psychology-book treatment of social
problems. They're great favorites in the Persian Gulf states,
especially among women who rarely leave their houses because of
strict Islamic rules and searing heat.
   Outside of Egypt, Persian Gulf states account for 80 percent of
Egyptian-made movie sales in the Arab region, ``and for the gulf
area, Kuwait was the boss,'' said Shafei.
   He said three of four films that were being wrapped up when Iraq
invaded Kuwait would be finished, although with financial
difficulty. Otherwise, he said, all plans for new films are ``on
hold.''
   No figures have been compiled on how much the film industry
stands to lose.
   ``We no longer have any contact with our Kuwaiti distributors,''
Shafei said in an interview. ``They owe us money, and we owe them
distribution rights. And in Saudi Arabia, they're worrying about
whether they will have a war on their hands, not about films.''
   By standards of the industry abroad, where a $10-million movie
is a cheapie, Egyptian balance-sheet figures are miniscule. Shafei
said producing a film costs between $40,000 and $160,000.
   The Egyptian cinema also depends on the Persian Gulf for its
profits, which are low at home because of high advertising costs
and tickets too expensive for many Egyptians. Additionally, there
is no effective law regulating video distribution, leaving the
field open to video pirates.
   Egyptian films normally earn $20,000 to $30,000 in each Persian
Gulf country, with total foreign distribution sales sometimes
reaching as much as $100,000.
   By comparison, a film sold in Iraq earns $12,000 to $20,000,
Shafei said, and the Iraqis have been known to take up to four
years to pay up.
   ``A number of people have come out and said one solution to the
loss of Persian Gulf money is for actors to take salary cuts. But I
think that's a very bad idea,'' Gamal-el-Din said.
   Egyptian movie stars are vastly underpaid compared to their
counterparts in the United States. But in a country where the
average wage earner takes home less than $1,000 a year, they don't
do badly.
   Superstar comedian Adel Imam is in a class of his own,
reportedly pocketing close to $150,000 per film. Otherwise, the top
actors and actresses earn $11,000 to $60,000 a film.
   Some Egyptian movies are shot in a month, but better ones with
the highest-paid stars take up to six months to make.

   In 1922, Urvan Ubben's parents had his
``funeral picture'' taken, certain he'd be the next family member
to die of diabetes.
   Today, the 77-year-old laughs at the childhood photo and how he
cheated death by being one of the first people to test insulin.
Experts say he may be the world's oldest surviving diabetic.
   ``I was one of the guinea pigs when Eli Lilly was trying to
mass-produce insulin in Indianapolis back in 1922,'' Ubben said.
``In those days, they figured that if you had diabetes, you didn't
have a chance. And my parents were highly skeptical of insulin.
   ``So when I came back from the experimental treatments in
Indianapolis, my parents still thought I was going to die and they
wanted a picture of me. So they had my picture taken.
   ``Years later, I was looking at my mother's old pictures with an
aunt. When we came across that photo, she said `Urv, there's your
funeral picture.' We just laughed about it.''
   Diabetes, a disease caused by excess sugar in the bloodstream,
was no laughing matter when Ubben developed it in 1922.
   Earlier that year, Ubben's sister Theola died after slipping
into a diabetic coma. Ubben already had lost an aunt, an uncle and
his great-grandfather to the disease.
   ``It was quite scary for my parents and they were pretty
discouraged,'' Ubben said. ``Insulin had just been discovered
earlier that year; no one knew anything about it.
   ``Of course, now we know it's wonderful stuff. It's kept me
alive all these years.''
   A spokeswoman at Eli Lilly and Co. in Indianapolis confirmed
Ubben's 1922 diagnosis and his testing of insulin after its
discovery in Toronto.
   The pharmaceutical company isn't sure if one other member of the
first test group is alive. Ubben may be the oldest surviving
diabetic, said Gene McCormick, retired Lilly historian.
   Ubben suffered frequent bouts with diabetes-related illnesses
brought on by ignoring doctors' orders to maintain a strict diet.
He became partially blind from an attack in 1938.
   He and his wife of nearly 53 years, Wilma, raised three children
and worked a small farm. He later ran a coin-operated machine
business and worked as a furniture maker and wood sculptor.
   Ubben learned the dangers of insulin overdose when he
experienced one of the first documented insulin reactions. After
his treatment in Indianapolis, he was in a Peoria hospital for
observation when he passed out.
   ``The doctor didn't have any idea what was wrong,'' said Ubben,
who described the episode in an autobiography 10 years ago.
   Because the hospital had no facilities to analyze Ubben's blood
for sugar content, a specimen was raced to a doctor's laboratory by
police.
   The lab technician was at the movies. While Ubben's parents were
summoned to their ``dying'' son's bedside, every theater in Peoria
flashed an emergency message on the screen to locate the technician.
   The message worked.
   The technician raced back to her lab to study Ubben's blood and
found the lowest blood sugar she had ever seen.
   But the hospital had no glucose to counter the insulin
overpowering Ubben's body.
   So his doctor pried the unconscious boy's teeth apart, shoved a
rubber hose down his throat and poured a bottle of corn syrup into
his stomach in a crude effort to raise his blood sugar. Ubben was
revived.
   ``My parents were racing to the hospital to see me shove off,''
Ubben said. ``They thought I was going to die. But I fooled them.
They got there in time to see me wipe syrup off my face.''

   How much trouble could it be to
repair a few hundred feet of earthquake-damaged pavement? In the
case of Highway 1, plenty.
   Half a million cubic yards of the winding, two-lane highway _
800 feet of road and the dirt below _ have been sliding into the
Pacific since October's quake.
   It was closed in January. Ordinarily, a few months of work would
have the highway looking brand new.
   But Highway 1 isn't an ordinary road. Nature and man keep it
unique.
   The stretch of road north of San Francisco was carved into a
cliff hundreds of feet above the sea. The scenic route chronicled
by John Steinbeck linked the northern and southern ends of the
state in the days before superhighways.
   Because the road cuts through a variety of jurisdictions, a
small army of bureaucrats has to approve before repairs can begin.
   Stinson Beach residents say the closed section is killing summer
tourism. Those living along Panoramic Highway, the mountain route
chosen as a detour, complain about heavy traffic they say isolates
them from emergency vehicles.
   The detour carries about 6,000 vehicles a day _ double last
summer's figure.
   ``If this road is blocked and someone up here has a heart
attack, the normal six- to seven-minute response time of paramedics
could turn into an hour,'' said Del Goetz, organizer of the
neighborhood Highway 1 Emergency Committee.
   Business at Stinson Beach, usually a popular summer hangout for
tourists and sunbathers, is down an estimated 30 percent.
   The California Department of Transportation, which routinely
removes slides from the coastal highway, initially estimated it
would take three months to clear and repair the fallen road.
   But the project was stalled by 13 federal, state and local
agencies that didn't want the dirt and blacktop shoved into the
ocean or dumped on land they protect.
   ``What used to be a county road through ranch land is now a
state road through state parks surrounded by federal parks near a
marine sanctuary at a time when environmental laws not only are
very strict, but are being enforced with vigor,'' said Jerry Hauke,
a Caltrans engineer.
   Involved are the Army Corps of Engineers, the state Department
of Fish and Game, the U.S. Wildlife Service and the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area, along with state and local commissions
and other groups.
   ``All of these little agencies have their microscopic duty.
That's the only angle they're looking at. Our problem is there is
no bureaucracy looking at it from the people's standpoint,'' said
Farhad Mansourian, deputy director of the county Public Works
Department.
   The environmental impact reports demanded by many of the
agencies could have delayed repairs up to three years, Hauke said.
   But a compromise worked out earlier this month could reopen the
road by next summer at a cost of $3 million to $5 million.
   The 13 agencies agreed to a state plan to rebuild the damaged
section on more stable ground 200 to 300 feet inland. The proposal
calls for pushing only the earth above the present road into the
ocean, Hauke said.
   The Army Corps of Engineers, which must issue the permit, said
formal approval could be given within 45 days of receiving
environmental clearance from other agencies.
   Goetz said history and red tape shouldn't be allowed to paralyze
the present.
   ``We need to revamp our culture so we don't become mired in the
bureaucracy,'' he said.

Escapees</HEAD>

   Desert nomads dashing to the Saudi
border with refugees from Kuwait have hundreds of new landmarks to
guide them as they evade a gauntlet of Iraqi soldiers.
   ``Now we are using the abandoned cars as a sign of where to
go,'' said Abdullah Al-Ajmi, a Bedouin guide who planned to make
his next foray into Kuwait today.
   Aside from the hundreds of stranded cars left by escapees, the
nomads rely on trees, telegraph poles and geography on the
dangerous journey.
   ``I know not to turn, at say the first hill but at the second
hill,'' said al-Ajmi, thinking of his routes. ``I know the desert
very well from hunting trips before the invasion.''
   Tens of thousands of refugees arrived across the desert sands in
the first three weeks after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent
annexation of Kuwait.
   Although refugees still come across the border, this frontier
town has largely fallen silent. The only sound at midday is a rope
flapping against an aluminum flagpole.
   With buildups of more than 100,000 troops on both sides of the
border, the Saudi government over the weekend declared all but the
official border crossing a closed military area.
   ``This is the new policy,'' Governor Khalid al-Otaishan said
before entering a meeting with Saudi and American military officers.
   There are constant consultations about plans in case of an Iraqi
attack.
   A Saudi official in Dhahran, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Saudi army is fanning out along the front lines _ with the
Americans at least 25 miles behind them.
   ``We would never put Americans up near the border. That could be
disastrous politically,'' the official said. ``If there are going
to be casualties a Saudi will have to die first.''
   Meanwhile, doctors at the Red Crescent tents near the border
said there are reports of deaths among those fleeing Kuwait as they
run out of water. The Red Crescent is the equivalent of the Red
Cross in Moslem countries.
   People who crossed the border Sunday said the Iraqis are now
shooting at anything that moves. One car arrived with its right
headlights smashed, a second with its spare tire punctured.
   About 60 people trickled across Sunday, including a group of 35
Pakistani and Bangladeshi workers in two vehicles. They lost a
pickup truck plus all their food, water, cigarettes and video tapes
to an Iraqi soldier.
   ``We were always afraid,'' said Aboul Qassem, a 44-year-old
refinery worker from Bangladesh.
   He said he decided to get out after Iraqi soldiers led away four
Westerners working in a hospital near where he works. Iraqi troops
have also taken to burning automobile showrooms and Western-style
supermarkets, Qassem said.
   The fear is not deterring some from crossing into Kuwait to try
to bring out family members.
   ``It's very difficult and dangerous,'' said al-Ajma. ``If there
are too many Iraqis on the way we have to turn back.''
   Mohammed al-Matar, who planned to cross back into Kuwait with
al-Ajma, said that on two previous trips they got past Iraqi troops
with gifts of bananas, cigarettes and cold water.
   ``One group told us that for four days they had been drinking
the water from the windshield washers of abandoned cars,'' he said.
   Groups usually travel around 2 p.m., when the temperature climbs
above 100 degrees and the soldiers usually seek shelter to rest.

   U.S. military officials say they're
just beginning to think about how to provide rest-and-relaxation
breaks for thousands of Americans deployed in the Saudi Arabian
desert.
   One possibility is renting a hotel where soldiers can take a
break from the searing desert conditions, according to Maj. Gen.
Gus Pagonis, who is in charge of logistics for Operation Desert
Shield.
   Soldiers are already grumbling about Saudi Arabia's prohibition
on alcohol. But Pagonis isn't worried about that.
   ``The alcohol has not been a problem whatsoever,'' he said. ``We
wouldn't be able to keep the beer cold anyway.''

   The State Department recently re-evaluated the pay structure at
the American Embassy in Kuwait and concluded employees there were
making too much money.
   As a result, the so-called ``hardship post'' differential was
cut from 25 percent to 20 percent.
   The change was made before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
There's no word on whether officials now plan to up the amount.
   The 30-odd staffers at the American Consulate in Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia, also receive a 20 percent differential.
   The amount of the differential depends on a number of factors,
including weather, the quality of health care, danger, availablity
of goods and services, and mail service.
   In Kuwait City, Iraqi soldiers cut off electricity and other
utilities to the U.S. Embassy and surrounded the compound, where
Ambassador Nathaniel Hawthorne and about 10 staff members remain in
defiance of Iraq's order to close foreign embassies.

   The T-shirt business is booming in Saudi Arabia with soldiers,
reporters and American expatriates the biggest customers.
   Soldiers with privileges to visit shops near Dhahran buy the
shirts in bulk, reselling them to the troops.
   Among the most popular slogans:
   _ ``Between Iraq and A Hard Place.'' Underneath is a map of
Saudi Arabia, with Dhahran singled out.
   _ ``Visit Iraq Before Iraq Visits You,'' with a Saudi map on the
front.
   _ ``U.S. Armed Forces: Summer Tour 1990.

   American women and children aren't the only ones who left
Dhahran after Iraq invaded Kuwait three weeks ago.
   Most pets have been shipped home too.
   One British Airways flight carried 71 canines in its hold.
   ``Bandit is in boarding school in Paso Robles, Calif.,'' said
Janice Stockwell, who performs ultrasounds at a hospital run by the
state-owned Saudi Aramco oil company.
   She said she spent $900 to ship the border collie back to her
parents' house, and added that many of her friends also sent their
pets home.
   ``I know I would get out, but what kind of priority is he'' she
said.

   A ship foundering in high seas with a crew of
17 headed for shelter under its own power today in the Western
Pacific after a Coast Guard plane dropped replacements for its
faulty bilge pumps.
   The 146-foot Royal Taipan had been reported in danger of sinking
after it began taking on water in 25-foot seas churned by 45 mph
tropical storm winds.
   An air-and-sea search was slowed by poor radio communication and
an inaccurate position reported by the former Navy minesweeper,
which was caught by the storm as it cruised to a shipyard for
renovations, the Coast Gurad.
   The Royal Taipan, whose owners intend to refurbish as a cruise
ship, was expected to reach Ulithi Atoll in the Federated States of
Micronesia today, Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Kent Youel said.
   The ship radioed for help Saturday night when it ran into the
fringes of Tropical Storm Abe, officials said. Someone on board
gave the ship's position as 225 miles south-southwest of Guam, the
Coast Guard said.
   It was located today by a search plane based in Hawaii that
homed in on an electronic emergency beacon about 500 miles
southwest of Guam.
   The ship was in 10- to 15-foot seas and 40 mph winds when the
pumps were dropped to the crew to replace the vessel's three failed
pumps, Youel said.
   At the atoll, the ship will be met by a patrol boat based nearby
so officers can inspect the vessel and determine its seaworthiness,
Youel said.
   The Royal Taipan, owned by Windjammer Cruises of Honolulu, had
left the Philippines for Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands,
said the Coast Guard. The crew reportedly was made up of Filipinos
and Americans.

   In the swiftness of the U.S.
military deployment, a limited transport capability has left some
units still without anti-aircraft weapons and other equipment field
commanders consider vital.
   Yet to arrive are the biggest American tanks, armored vehicles
and artillery _ all key cogs in the U.S. strategy for any extended
desert ground war against Iraqi troops.
   Some field commanders report isolated shortages of parts. Others
are still waiting for ground-to-air anti-aircraft protection.
   But the unprecedented deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia
so far appears to have proceeded without major problems.
   ``We've accomplished miracles in a short period of time,'' said
Army Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, who is in charge of logistics for the
U.S. deployment.
   Pagonis, who met with reporters near a major U.S. staging area
in Saudi Arabia, called the effort ``probably the largest exercise
ever accomplished in a short period of time since World War II.''
   The delays in getting the heavy equipment are blamed not on
logistical or command lapses but on the limited capacity of the
military's air and sea transport capacity. Officials say many of
the concerns should be addressed over the next week to 10 days, as
more ships arrive.
   Pagonis said an average of 50 transport flights arrive in Saudi
Arabia daily, carrying troops, equipment and supplies he is hoping
to build into at least a 30-day reserve stockpile.
   Much of the heavy equipment sought by field commanders _ M-1
tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery and anti-aircraft
batteries _ are on ships headed for the Saudi kingdom.
   The first such shipment is due to arrive by midweek; the tanks
will be deployed into the desert in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
   The United States has no military stockpiles in the Middle East.
With the emphasis in getting troops to Saudi Arabia, Air Force
cargo planes had carried only limited equipment until last week,
when civilian aircraft were pressed into duty as troop carriers.
   Also, it takes more than 24 hours to fly from the United States
to Saudi Arabia and nearly a month for even the fastest sealift
ships to make the trip, and the Navy has just eight of those.
Pagonis said he assumed the United States would explore
establishing a storage depot somewhere in the region.
   Among units still waiting for some of its heavy equipment is an
Army helicopter unit based in the Saudi desert. The unit would need
forward-based refueling and repair facilities in the event of
extended fighting, but had just a few mobile fuel tankers as of
Saturday _ barely enough to keep choppers at its staging camp
refueled.
   ``If they go to forward positions, I would have nothing back
here,' an officer with the unit said.
   The officer also said stockpiles of certain spare parts were low
_ parts that would be needed in any extended combat situation
because of the toll of the desert heat and sand on the helicopters
and other equipment.
   ``We're told they'll be here pretty soon,'' the officer said.
   Another concern voiced by a number of officers was the shortage
at some sites of heavy artillery and ground-to-air defense systems.
   ``We're concerned about it,'' an Air Force officer said during a
recent visit to his desert base area when asked about the lack of
anti-aircraft protection. ``We're pretty naked out here right now.''
   The concern for heavy ground forces, particularly tanks and
armored vehicles, stems from Iraq's formidable tank force.
   Air Force Col. Sandy Sharpe, commander of a wing of A-10
tank-killers stationed in the Saudi desert, said his unit had a few
minor problems with spare parts but said, ``they'll roll in.''
   Still, Sharpe said the deployment here proved the need for an
expanded air-transport capacity to guarantee against any shortages.
   ``If you don't have it, you can have all the jets in the world
and they'll just sit,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel is lying low during the Persian Gulf crisis
to avoid upsetting any joint U.S.-Arab effort to contain Iraq,
Israel's ambassador to the United States says.
   Moshe Arad also said Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait supports
Israel's long-held belief that the Iraqi president is dangerous.
Israel claimed to have thwarted Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear
weapons by bombing an Iraqi reactor in 1981.
   ``Now, we feel vindicated. But that doesn't make us any
happier,'' Arad told a gathering of the International B'nai B'rith
on Sunday. ``For these recent events bring the danger of another
war in the Middle East closer to Israel, and yes, closer to
America.''
   Arad addressed about 1,000 people from more than 40 countries at
the gathering of the world's largest Jewish organization.
   He said that to prevent upsetting any U.S.-Arab efforts to turn
back Saddam, the Jewish state is ``keeping a low profile in the
crisis.'' America is widely resented in the Arab world because it
is seen as Israel's protector.
   Arad said Arab-Israeli friction is just part of the formula
creating tension in the Middle East.
   ``The major source of conflict is the intent of Arab dictators
to pursue their grand designs to achieve power and influence
through military might,'' he said.
   ``Indeed, the absence of democratic regimes in the Arab world
and the wild enthusiasm for violence there will make the resolution
of the Arab-Israeli conflict even more difficult.''
   American support for Arab countries opposing Saddam, including
recent approval of sophisticated new fighter planes for Saudi
Arabia, might one day hurt Israel, the statesman said.
   ``When this crisis is over, we must remember that there might be
another crisis, with its center an Arab front against Israel,''
Arad said. ``The present conflict and crisis should not be allowed
to ... upset the military balance in the region.''
   The ambassador took the opportunity to blast longtime enemies
for their actions during the crisis. Palestine Liberation
Organization leader Yasser Arafat's support of Saddam shows ``the
kind of regime he would impose on his own people, and the kind of
peace the PLO intends for the region and for Israel,'' he said.
   Arad criticized _ and warned _ King Hussein of Jordan, who he
said ``is trying to please Saddam.''
   ``Unless he takes a courageous position against Iraqi
aggression, he might find himself pretty soon the next victim on
Saddam's list,'' Arad said.

agreement to give blacks equal representation on the Selma school
board and end eight months of racial strife, the mayor says.
   ``We're trying to throw politics out the window and reach some
kind of agreement that everybody can live with,'' Mayor Joe
Smitherman said.
   City Council members and Smitherman met with about two dozen
black leaders Sunday night to draw up the agreement, he said.
Smitherman said ``there are still questions to be answered'' but
that he hoped to announce the details today.
   The proposal would end white dominance of the school board and
ultimately establish a plan to alternate control between the two
factions, said Smitherman, who is white. The 5,900-student district
is about 80 percent black.
   The 11-member school board's five blacks walked out in December
after the six whites on the panel refused to renew the contract of
Norward Roussell, the district's first black superintendent.
   Demonstrations, lawsuits, boycotts and scuffles followed. A
black protest leader was arrested twice.
   The agreement would have five white and five black board members
voting on all issues. Board chairman Carl Barker, who is white,
would vote only when school litigation matters were involved.
   Once all the lawsuits are resolved the panel would revert to a
plan in which whites and blacks would take turns in control, the
mayor said.

<HEAD>Stocks Up In Tokyo On Mideast Optimism, Dollar Drops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Optimism about the Middle East situation prevailed
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, lifting share prices sharply.
The dollar declined against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
428 points on Friday, rose 976.00 points, or 4.04 percent, to close
at 25,141.76.
   Dealers attributed the Nikkei index's rise to the general
sentiment among investors that the unrest in the Middle East will
not escalate in the immediate future.
   ``Investors have been extremely sensitive about the Iraqi
situation, and as a result, they have overreacted to the daily
development in the Middle East,'' said a dealer with Nomura
Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Nikkei index shed 2,620.96 last week amid continuing
uncertainties over the Persian Gulf crisis. Between Iraqi's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait and last Friday the Nikkei plunged 6,668 points,
or 21.6 percent.
   Dealers said they expect the Nikkei index to continue to rise
unless ``something drastic happens'' in the Middle East.
   A dealer with Nikko Securities Co., while warning of future
uncertainties, acknowledged that ``investors are finding some of
the shares have fallen to bargain levels.''
   Volume traded on the first section of the exchange was 330
million shares.
   On the currency market, the dollar closed at 144.80 yen, down
0.90 yen from Friday's close of 145.70 yen. After opening at 145.20
yen, the currency moved in a range of 144.80-145.55 yen.
   Currency dealers said trading was mixed throughout today.
   ``While some investors are trying to sell the dollar because of
their pessimistic evaluations of the U.S. economy, other investors
are buying it because of the continuing uncertainties over the
(Persian) Gulf situation,'' said Akiko Baba, a customer dealer with
the Bank of Tokyo.
   Another dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank said the currency lost
ground toward the end of the day in response to the news report
that Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-general of the United
Nations, would meet with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz later
this week to discuss the crisis.
   ``When likelihood of a war increases, the dollar is usually
bought, and when the opposite occurs, the dollar goes down,'' he
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond slipped to 8.215 percent at 4:00 p.m. from
Friday's 8.355-percent close. Their price stood at 82.58 points, up
from 81.99.

<HEAD>Stranger Posts Bail for Man Charged in Wife's Suicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 72-year-old man charged with helping his wife
commit suicide has been bailed out of jail by a bondsman he had
never met.
   ``This man is not a criminal. He was just trying to do the right
thing for someone he loved,'' said Carl Wardlaw, who posted the
$25,000 that got Bertram Harper out of jail Sunday.
   Harper, of Loomis, Calif., is charged with murder and conspiracy
in the Aug. 19 suicide of his 69-year-old wife, Virginia Lee, in a
Romulus hotel room.
   Mrs. Harper, who was said to have cancer, flew to Michigan on
Aug. 18. Police said she killed herself by taking pills and putting
a plastic bag over her head while her husband and stepdaughter
stood by.
   Harper said they came to Michigan after learning the state has
no specific laws against suicide or assisting in it. He said the
death of an Oregon woman who used a doctor's suicide machine
brought the state's law to his attention.
   Wardlaw, a bondsman for 10 years, said it was the first time he
had used his own money to bail out someone.
   ``I bail out so many people who don't deserve it, people who
probably belong where they are,'' he said. ``I used to be married
and I loved my wife. If she had ever been in that kind of situation
I would have wanted to do the same for her.''
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian, builder of the suicide machine used June 4
by Alzheimer's victim Janet Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore., has not
been charged.

   The Soviet Union, which over the weekend supported
a U.N. resolution sanctioning military action to back an
international trade embargo against Iraq, says it will not include
itself among the enforcers.
   But Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Sunday that Moscow
would not object if the United States and other nations use force
``within the framework of that resolution.''
   In a joint statement, Shevardnadze and visiting French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas urged Iraq to ``show realism and common sense
and to heed the will of the international community expressed in
the resolutions of the Security Council on the (Persian) Gulf
crisis.''
   The U.N. Security Council approved the resolution Saturday. It
called for ``such measures commensurate with the specific
circumstances as may be necessary'' to end trade with Iraq, which
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and annexed it.
   The Soviet Union has two warships in the Gulf of Oman, and they
are part of a large international naval armada in the Persian Gulf
region to pressure Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   But Shevardnadze said Moscow had no plans to send any more
vessels to the region, adding: ``We will not take part in the use
of any force.
   ``We voted (for the U.N. resolution) because other nations ...
are ready to take part in inspecting the ships, craft, vessels,
which are suspected of carrying prohibited products and
merchandise,'' he said.
   ``The United States and other countries which are represented in
this area _ I mean which have their own armed forces _ they should
act, but within the framework of that resolution,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union, however, continued diplomatic efforts to
resolve the three-week-old Middle East crisis. Egypt's foreign
minister, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, met with Shevardnadaze today, Tass
said without providing details.
   At a news conference with Dumas on Sunday, Shevardnadze denied
reports that 193 Soviet military advisers still in Iraq are
participating ``in preparing details of military operations.''
   He said the advisers would be brought home soon after their
contracts expire and Soviet women and children have been evacuated.
   Shevardnadze, however, noted that U.N. resolutions do not
prohibit the presence of advisers, but acknowledged ``there is a
moral side of the issue and the political aspect, and we understand
this.''
   ``Certain mass media put forward information that our military
advisers take part in preparing details of military operations,
etc. That is not true,'' he said.
   Soviet officials said last week that the military experts
continue to repair and maintain Soviet-built weapons and teach
Iraqi soldiers how to use them.
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov said Friday that about 900
of the 7,791 Soviets still in Iraq are women and children, whom he
hoped would be evacuated by Sept. 1.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Among Casualties In Major Cabinet Shakeup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thailand's foreign minister, architect
of its hard-line stance this past decade on Vietnam's invasion of
Cambodia, lost his post in a major Cabinet reshuffle today.
   Five new deputy prime ministers were named and the heads of six
of the 13 ministries were replaced in the shakeup, which was
engineered by Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and announced by
his office.
   It was designed to boost the government's image after corruption
scandals in which two deputy ministers had been fired.
   Siddhi Savetsila, foreign minister since 1980, was replaced by
Subin Pinkayan, who had been commerce minister. Siddhi's deputy,
Prapas Limpabhandu, also was replaced. They both belonged to the
scandal-plagued Social Action Party but were not themselves accused
of any wrongdoing.
   ``We have to change to a new team ... but foreign policy will
not change,'' Chatichai told reporters today.
   Siddhi had led efforts to isolate and punish Vietnam after it
invaded Cambodia in late 1978, installed a new Communist government
and put thousands of hostile troops at Thailand's doorstep.
   But his influence declined markedly after Chatichai became
premier in August 1988 and set out to turn Indochina's
``battlefields into marketplaces.'' Thailand still backs the
Cambodian guerrilla forces, but Siddhi's approach gave way to Thai
mediation in peace talks involving increased contacts with Vietnam
and the Vietnamese-installed government.
   Also, two well-known technocrats without any party affiliation
took over key ministries. Virabongse Ramangura became finance
minister and Amaret Sila-on became commerce minister.
   The reshuffle added a seventh party to the ruling coalition, the
Puangchon Chaothai Party of former Army Commander-in-Chief Gen.
Arthit Kamlang-ek. Arthit became a deputy premier.
   Arthit went into politics after he was fired as army chief in
May 1986 by former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda for publicly
challenging the government.
   The government was badly shaken by scandals that led to the
firing the past two weeks of two deputy ministers belonging to the
Social Action Party.
   Fired Saturday was Deputy Commerce Minister Pinya Chuayplod, who
was held responsible for the import of parts for assembling illegal
gambling machines. Deputy Interior Minister Santi Chaivirattana was
sacked Aug. 15 after accusations that he took bribes to ease safety
regulations of gas stations.
   Due to the scandals, Siddhi last week resigned as leader of the
Social Action Party and returned the reins to Kukrit Pramoj, 79, a
former prime minister who founded the party and had gone into
political retirement.
   The conservative, pro-West Chatichai administration has been
dogged by allegations of corruption since it came to power for a
four-year term in the July 1988 parliamentary election.

   Freed Irish hostage Brian Keenan spent
most of his nearly 4{ years in captivity in Lebanon chained and
blindfolded with British captive John McCarthy in a tiny basement
room, one of Keenan's doctors says.
   ``For much of the time they weren't allowed to talk above a
whisper and the heat and the mosquitoes were terrible,'' Dr. Sean
Blake said Sunday, a day after Keenan arrived in Dublin.
   Keenan also said he had been beaten by his captors but ``he
didn't go into any detail and I didn't ask him about it,'' Blake
said.
   Blake, a cardiologist, is one of the doctors tending Keenan at
Mater hospital in Dublin, where he was taken for a checkup after
his flight home from Syria aboard an Irish government jet. Keenan
was freed Friday in Beirut and turned over to Irish officials in
Syria a day later.
   The hospital said this morning that Keenan complained of sore
eyes and noise in his ears, and had dental cavities. The hospital
statement described the problems as minor and said Keenan would
begin physiotherapy today.
   Keenan, a 39-year-old Belfast teacher, spent his first full day
back in Ireland undergoing medical tests and making phone calls to
the families of McCarthy and other hostages he left behind in
Lebanon, including Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   Keenan said Saturday that he saw Anderson and Sutherland during
his captivity, and that they were in good spirits.
   He was to undergo more tests today, including a psychiatric
examination.
   ``He's very good with the doctors and especially good with the
nurses,'' Keenan's sister Brenda Gillham said with a chuckle.
   She said her brother was tired but ``in very good spirits'' and
eating everything in sight.
   Sister Gemma Byrne, the hospital's chief executive, said Keenan
had lost 42 pounds in captivity and ``must have a complete rest.''
   Blake said Keenan was somewhat malnourished and unfit from lack
of physical activity but otherwise appeared ``very well.''
   The fifth Western hostage freed in as many months, Keenan was
kidnapped April 11, 1986, in west Beirut while walking to the
American University where he taught English.
   During his first months in captivity, Keenan said he was held in
a prison where there were only Arabs and felt very isolated because
he didn't speak the language, Blake said.
   After some months, Keenan said McCarthy joined him and they gave
each other ``mutual support,'' Blake said.
   McCarthy, 33, a reporter for the London-based Worldwide
Television News, was captured April 17, 1986.
   ``Up to six months ago, they were living in this tiny room in a
basement, chained and blindfolded for much of the time,'' the
doctor said.
   During that time, Keenan said there was no possibility for any
physical activity and the food was meager, Blake said.
   But six months ago, Keenan said their treatment improved: they
were given meat for the first time and were able ``to do some sort
of exercise,'' Blake said.
   He said Keenan told him that his captors came to the room he
shared with McCarthy on Thursday and started to take him away
without explanation.
   ``He said `No,' he would not go without John McCarthy,'' Blake
said. ``But in the end, he had no option. They just told him, `We
want you out.'''
   Former American hostage Frank Reed, who spent about three years
in the same room or house as Keenan and McCarthy, visited Keenan
for about 20 minutes on Sunday.
   Reed was released April 30, eight days after fellow U.S. hostage
Robert Polhill was freed. Two Swiss Red Cross workers, Emanuel
Christen and Elio Erriquez, were freed earlier this month.
   Keenan was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland and was traveling
on an Irish passport, but has dual British-Irish citizenship.
   A little-known group calling itself The Organization of the
Islamic Dawn announced his release on Friday. Until the kidnappers'
statement, no group had claimed responsibility for Keenan's
abduction.
   Six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans and an Italian are
still believed held by extremist Moslems in Lebanon.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, had been held the longest. He was kidnapped on March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   Vajra Regent Osel Tendzin, who as the first
Westerner to lead an international Tibetan Buddhist sect was
stripped of his duties after contracting AIDS, has died of the
disease at age 47, church members said.
   Tendzin, born Thomas Rich, died Saturday at Pacific Presbyterian
Medical Center, according to church members speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Hospital spokeswoman Julie Murray could not confirm his death,
saying no one was registered under either name.
   Tendzin in 1976 was designated his spiritual mentor's successor
as leader of Vajradhatu, a Dharmadatu Buddhist community based in
Boulder, Colo.
   In 1988, he disclosed he had AIDS. News reports at the time said
the charismatic leader also acknowledged putting others at risk
through his sexual behavior.
   The revelation divided the 3,500-member sect. Supporters
insisted he remain as leader; critics argued he betrayed followers'
trust and must resign.
   The church's board of directors wrested leadership from Tendzin
last year after he refused to step down. He went into more than a
year of meditation and seclusion, a traditional Buddhist practice.
   Tendzin was raised in Passaic, N.J. After dropping out of
Fordham University, he met the Venerable Chogyam Trungpa in 1971
and became the Tibetan Buddhist leader's top student. Trungpa gave
him the name Osel Tendzin, or ``radiant holder of the teachings.''
   Vajradhatu was founded by Trungpa, who had fled the 1950 Chinese
invasion of Tibet to settle in Boulder. Trungpa also founded the
Naropa Institute, an accredited liberal arts college combining
Eastern and Western studies.
   When Trungpa named Tendzin as his successor, it was the first
time a Westerner had achieved such a position in Tibetan Buddhism.
Trungpa died in 1987 at the age of 47.
   Vajradhatu's members include about 800 people in Boulder. It is
a diverse group of mostly non-Asians who live ``normal, family
lives,'' said Rick Fields, who quit as editor of a Buddhist
newspaper after organization leaders refused to let him publish
information about Tendzin's illness.
   Tendzin is survived by his wife, Lila, and their four children,
all of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
   Funeral arrangements not immediately known.

<HEAD>Thrift Regulator Raised Money for Banking Committee Senator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A savings and loan regulator solicited campaign
contributions from other thrift watchdogs for a U.S. senator on the
Banking Committee.
   Kermit Mowbray, former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank
in Topeka, Kan., raised money for former Sen. David Karnes, R-Neb.,
the Denver Post reported Sunday.
   Federal law restricts government employees from raising money
for federal campaigns, but Home Loan Bank employees aren't covered
by the rule.
   Mowbray is the target of a Treasury Department investigation
into allegations he delayed the seizure of the failed Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan to protect then-presidential candidate
George Bush from bad publicity.
   Bush's son, Neil, was a Silverado board member, and loans he
approved for a business associate have come under scrutiny by S&amp;L
investigators.
   Mowbray, who was fired without explanation after Silverado
failed, defended his fund-raising for Karnes.
   ``I didn't see anything wrong with that,'' Mowbray said in an
interview last week. Karnes ``deserved our support.''
   Karnes was chairman of the Topeka branch of the Home Loan Bank
before being appointed to the Senate when Democrat Ed Zorinsky
died. He ran unsuccessfully for the seat in 1988.
   Mowbray was in charge of regulating Silverado when he asked
colleagues to support Karnes' campaign. He contributed $2,000, and
others donated at least $1,000, records show.
   Edwin Gray, former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
which governed the Topeka bank, said Mowbray's fund-raising ``shows
very poor judgment. It's dead wrong.''
   ``If there was any kind of coercion, I would say that it is at
the least highly improper and possibly a violation of the law,''
Gray said.
   Karnes said he spoke with Mowbray by telephone frequently but
was unaware of the contributions from thrift regulators. ``Frankly,
I was so busy I didn't have time to notice where my campaign funds
came from,'' he said.
   Regarding the alleged delay in closing Silverado, Mowbray
testified before the House Banking Committee in June that he
received a phone call from Washington directing him to postpone
Silverado's closing from October 1988 to December 1988. Bush was
elected president in November.
   He said he didn't remember who called or whether he took the
call himself.
   Mowbray, who earned $190,000 a year as president of the Topeka
regulatory bank, gave $2,000 to Karnes' campaign in June 1987. He
said he suggested to presidents of the system's 12 regional banks
that they also contribute.
   Federal election records show that in June 1987, Thurman
Connell, president of the system's bank in Des Moines, and Brian
Dittenhaufer, president of the New York branch, each gave $500 to
Karnes' campaign, the newspaper said.
   Last week, Karnes, whose committee had a role in regulating the
industry, denied ever discussing Neil Bush or Silverado with
Mowbray.
   ``I talked to Kermit because he was in Washington about once a
month, and he called just to say, `How's it going?''' Karnes said.
``It was against the law (to talk about specific institutions), so
even if we wanted to we couldn't discuss it.''

   The South was under a haze early today and much of the East had
fog. Skies were partly cloudy in the rest of the country.
   High pressure from the southern Rockies to the Appalachians was
expected to bring hot, sticky weather to most of the country.
Record temperatures were possible in the Plains and Mississippi
Valley, with highs in the 100s.
   Sunny skies and temperatures in the 90s were predicted for most
of the East, South and Midwest, but a storm system was forming over
Florida.
   Scattered showers were possible in Louisiana and Texas, and a
cold front was expected to bring showers to the Great Lakes region.
Rain was expected in Oregon and Northern California, and showers
were also possible in Arizona and New Mexico.
   The coolest weather were expected in the Pacific Northwest, with
highs only in the 70s. Elsewhere, temperatures in the 80s were
forecast for the Great Lakes and New England, and highs in the 100s
were predicted for the Southwest.
   The high temperature for the nation Sunday was 106 at Medicine
Lodge, Kan., and Salina, Kan.

   Lebanon said today that its ambassador in
Kuwait and his nine-member staff were missing, and it was feared
they were taken hostage by Iraq.
   Salah Staitieh, director general of the Lebanese Foreign
Ministry, said Ambassador Adnan Badra closed the embassy in Kuwait
City when he was recalled for consultations by the Lebanese
government last week.
   ``He notified us that he was coming with the entire embassy
staff via Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Syria. They were due in Beirut
two days ago,'' Staitieh told The Associated Press.
   ``But we have learned through unofficial channels that the
ambassador and the embassy personnel are in Baghdad. We do not know
why. We have no contact with our embassy in Iraq,'' Staitieh added.
   Local radio stations said Badra, the head of the embassy's
consular section, plus two diplomats and six administrators were
seized by Iraqi troops as they set out for the Saudi border on
Tuesday.
   They were taken to Baghdad, where they were being held
incommunicado, according to the broadcasts, which cited unnamed
Lebanese government sources.
   The government of President Elias Hrawi is allied with Syria,
Iraq's main Arab foe. Both have condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait and Baghdad's subsequent order to remove all foreign
embassies to Iraq.
   Iraq last week ordered all embassies in Kuwait to close. About
30 countries have defied the order and remained open with skeleton
staff, including the United States and the 12 members of the
European Community.
   On Friday, Iraqi troops began gathering outside some embassies.
Water, power and telephones have been periodically cut off, but
there have been no reports of diplomats being forcibly removed from
their embassies.

   The dollar dropped to a record low against the
West German mark today, and was lower against other key currencies
in European trading.
   Gold was lower in thin trading.
   The dollar opened at 1.5385 West German marks in Frankfurt this
morning, the lowest level since World War II. The previous post-war
low was 1.5400 marks on Thursday.
   At 6 a.m. EDT the dollar was trading at 1.5425 Deutsche Marks,
down from 1.5575 marks late Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.80 yen, down 0.90 yen from
Friday's close. Later in Europe, it was quoted at 144.70 yen.
   Traders in Milan, Italy, said market players were liquidating
precautionary positions taken in a spurt of dollar buying on Friday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.2660 Swiss francs, down from 1.2685
   _5.1770 French francs, down from 5.2275
   _1.7385 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7550
   _1,146.00 Italian lire, down from 1,157.50
   _1.1330 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1335
   The British pound was quoted at $1.9485, compared with $1.9445
late Friday.
   Currency dealers in Tokyo said trading was mixed today.
   ``While some investors are trying to sell the dollar because of
their pessimistic evaluations of the U.S. economy, other investors
are buying it because of the continuing uncertainties over the Gulf
situation,'' said Akiko Baba, a customer dealer with the Bank of
Tokyo.
   Another dealer at Daiichi Kangyo Bank said the currency lost
ground toward the end of the day in response to the news report
that Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary-general of the United
Nations, will meet with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz later
this week.
   The dollar tends to rise when the market is fearful of conflict,
and retreat when there is hope for peace.
   London's gold and silver markets were closed for a bank holiday
today.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at a bid price of $407.25 per troy
ounce, from $410.75 late Friday.

   Angolan writer and politician Mario
Pinto de Andrade, who helped lead a guerrilla war against
Portuguese colonial rule, died Sunday in London after a long
illness. He was 62.
   Pinto de Andrade became the first president of the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola in 1960, just before the
Marxist group launched a 15-year battle. In 1974, he split with the
Popular Movement, a year before it came to power with Angola's
independence.
   Recently, he had worked with other veterans of the Popular
Movement trying to mediate the long civil war between the Popular
Movement government and rebels of the U.S.-backed UNITA, or
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.

   Tendzin, born Thomas Rich, died of respiratory failure at
Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center in San Francisco, according to

   Disclosure of his disease, and reports that he had put other

   Gasoline rose more than a nickel a gallon at
the pump in the past two weeks as motorists continued to feel the
effects of the Persian Gulf crisis, according to a national survey.
   The average price for all grades of gasoline rose 5.2 cents to
$1.3316 a gallon, the Lundberg Survey of 13,500 gas stations
reported Sunday.
   The previous survey spanned a three-week period rather than two
weeks and found a 10.23-cent increase in the national average.
   A penny of that increase was due to gasoline tax increases.
There were no new taxes in the latest survey, oil analyst Trilby
Lundberg said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration is expressing hope the
Persian Gulf crisis still can be resolved without military
conflict, if worldwide economic sanctions force Iraq's Saddam
Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait.
   ``He's a classic case of someone who is vulnerable to
sanctions,'' Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, said of Saddam.
   ``The strategy is to put maximum pressure on Iraq through the
U.N.,'' Pickering said.
   ``We're watching if the sanctions are going to bite and how
rapidly,'' Pickering said on NBC's ``Today'' show. Pickering said
Saddam is ``heavily dependent on oil exports,'' and ``it might be a
month or two before it begins to bite.''
   ``I can see a peaceful way out of it,'' national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft said Sunday. ``Saddam Hussein must now see
he's facing overwhelming world opinion.
   ``He is casting about for a way out of the box in which he finds
himself,'' Scowcroft said.
   A final piece of the administration strategy was set in place on
Saturday when the United Nations Security Council agreed to
authorize the use of military power to enforce the worldwide
economic embargo against Iraq.
   It was the first time in U.N. history that approval had been
given for military action to support economic sanctions. The United
States had lobbied hard for the U.N. resolution.
   Pickering said the resolution is ``significant in two ways.
First, it gives us the muscle, all of us cooperating to to enforce
the U.N. sanctions. Secondly, it is the first time in 45 years,
literally, we've gotten this kind of world unity to deal with an
agressor.''
   In Turkey, 52 Americans connected with the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait were permitted to cross the border from Iraq into Turkey on
Sunday, and planned to return to the United States today. Three
young males were detained by Iraqi border authorities.
   An administration official with President Bush in Kennebunkport,
Maine, said all three young men were over 18 years old. The
official, who declined to be identified by name, said there was no
indication that the three were harmed, but that they were sent back
to Baghdad with the escort officer.
   About 2,500 other Americans have been barred from leaving Kuwait
and another 500 face a similar fate in Iraq. All told, more than 50
are under arrest in the two countries, according to the State
Department.
   ``If he touches one of those civilians ... if he touches one, he
is liable under the Geneva Convention of 1949, which was put into
international treaty with Iraq as a party'' Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., said today on ABC's ``Good Morning, America.''
   ``That means he hangs, and his commanders hang,'' Moynihan said.
   The specter of global economic pressure on Iraq, combined with
the U.S.-led military buildup in Saudi Arabia, prompted several
analysts who appeared on network television talk shows Sunday to
forecast an eventual reversal by Saddam of his Aug. 2 conquest of
Kuwait.
   Former national security advisers Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew
Brzezinski indicated there was room for hope that the gulf crisis
could be resolved short of military conflict.
   Kissinger said he believes that ``Saddam Hussein is looking for
some way out ... if we stay firm ... we will get it.''
   Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan said he was optimistic about
Saddam's willingness to negotiate.
   Both Scowcroft and Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat endorsed
the concept of a mediating role by U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, who is seeking urgent talks with Iraqi officials
this week.
   Scowcroft said Saddam has shown himself to be a realist, citing
his willingness two weeks ago to bow to Iran's terms for a
settlement of their eight-year war. Among other concessions, Saddam
agreed to recognize the pre-war boundary of the two countries.
   Al-Mashat contrasted Iraq's ``desire for peace'' with the
American ``design to have war.'' He said the U.S. aggressive
intentions were demonstrated by the dispatch of offensive weaponry,
including stealth fighter bombers, to Saudi Arabia.
   He said the U.S. allegation that Iraq posed a threat to Saudi
Arabia ``was the biggest deception in history.''
   The undersecretary of state for political affairs, Robert
Kimmitt, said that sooner or later, Saddam's hand will be forced by
the economic sanctions.
   ``I think they (the sanctions) are becoming increasingly
effective. I think the difference between this sanction regime and
past sanctions regimes is that it enjoys the virtually unanimous
support of the world community and therefore I think the sanctions
are beginning to pinch more and more as each day goes by,'' Kimmitt
said.
   ``When he (Saddam) sees that the world community is not breaking
rank that it is staying behind the U.N. Security Council-mandated
sanctions that he would understand that he has only one way out and
that is to withdraw from Kuwait,'' he said.

   Rescue crews said today that they had
pulled 69 bodies from a coal mine rocked by an explosion that
trapped 179 pit workers. Officials said they believed all still
below were dead.
   Rescuers working around the clock since the blast late Sunday
reported problems reaching remaining miners. Tons of concrete
blocks and other debris blocked the shaft where the explosion
occurred.
   The blast at the Dobrnja-Jug pit of the Kreka mine, 90 miles
west of Belgrade, left a crater 45 feet wide and about 15 feet
deep. The explosion was thought to have been caused by a buildup of
either coal dust or methane gas.
   Only one man, who was working near the surface, was pulled alive
from the mine, said Vidan Krsnanovic, a director of the rescue
operation.
   Bosko Zelic, a member of the mine's managing board, said there
were 180 miners in the pit at the time of the explosion, and that
no other survivors were likely. Earlier reports indicated 169 were
below ground.
   If the trapped pit workers died, it would be the worst mining
disaster in Yugoslav history.
   There was no immediate indication how far underground the miners
were trapped. The blast occurred at a depth of about 1,500 feet.
   Tangled ruins of the conveyor belt that carried coal from the
shaft were scattered around the mine's mouth. Huge pieces of a
concrete archway that formed the mine entrance were being pulled
away by cranes.
   The force of the blast ripped out steel supports and ventilation
equipment, the Tanjug news agency reported.
   Kreka mine, one of the oldest in Yugoslavia, was the site of a
weeklong strike for higher pay that ended Friday. Mining experts
interviewed by Belgrade radio said high concentrations of the
highly flammable methane gas might have accumulated in the shafts
during the strike.
   Strikers demonstrated in Sarajevo, capital of Yugoslavia's
central region of Bosnia, throughout the past week. They returned
to work Saturday after being promised a 100 percent increase in
their average $270 monthly salaries.
   Yugoslavia's worst mining disasters occurred in 1965, when 128
miners died in another colliery in Bosnia.
   Ninety miners died in a methane gas blast last November at a
coal mine about 125 miles south of Belgrade. The explosion was
apparently caused by welders working inside one of the shafts.
   That mine was closed permanently after officials determined it
could not be repaired.
   Officials consider many of Yugoslavia's coal mines unsafe, but
only recently have they begun issuing orders to close the most
dangerous ones.

<HEAD>OPEC Ministers Said Close to Pact on Temporary Production Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC ministers were moving today toward
an agreement allowing for a temporary increase in oil production to
help fill the gap caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, sources said.
   Ten of the 11 nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries meeting informally in Vienna have agreed in principle to
authorize an increase, said a delegation source, who demanded
anonymity.
   ``They see the need for some kind of OPEC sanction to increase
production,'' he said.
   Only Iran, which contends there is enough excess oil in the
industrialized world to meet any shortfall, was opposed, he said.
   About 4 million barrels of oil a day have been lost to the world
market because of the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti
oil. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded and occupied
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Venezuela and Saudi Arabia would like the cartel's backing to
boost oil production and help make up part of the loss.
   Ministers from 11 of the cartel's 13 countries began informal
talks on Sunday to decide whether to grant exemptions to their
current production agreement.
   Only Iraq and Libya were not present Sunday for the
consultations with OPEC President Sadek Boussena, the Algerian oil
minister. Libyan officials were expected to arrive later today, and
they might oppose any move to raise production.
   Under the supply accord worked out last month, the ministers
agreed to restrain production at 22.5 million barrels a day in the
second half of the year to try to reach a new target price of $21 a
barrel. The benchmark was reached almost immediately because of the
gulf crisis.
   Crude oil prices have topped the $30 mark on fears of military
escalation and a shortage of supplies in the oil-rich gulf region.
   The delegation source said any new accord to permit increased
crude pumping would likely include promises that production be
reduced once the crisis ends.
   It also would probably call on consuming nations to take steps
to use oil in storage to help meet any shortages, he said.
   He said talks were continuing to work out the details. An
accord, he said, could be arranged without holding a formal meeting
of the cartel.
   On Sunday, Venezuelan Oil Minister Celestino Armas appealed to
his counterparts to call an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis.
   The oil market, he said, ``is suffering ... an important
disruption, and we have to do something about that.''
   Armas said six nations _ one short of the needed majority _
wanted to convene an urgent meeting. They are: Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Ecuador and Kuwait.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela were turned down last week in an
attempt to call an emergency meeting. But Armas said the informal
talks could result in a formal session this week.
   ``We do think that these consultations should lead to an
extraordinary conference in order to take the decisions and to take
the actions that the world is waiting from OPEC at this moment,''
he said.
   Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the finance minister of the Kuwaiti
government in exile, urged higher output quotas for countries with
the capacity to pump more. Sabah was Kuwait's oil minister until
July.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, has said the kingdom
will raise its output by 2 million barrels a day _ with or without
OPEC's blessing. The oil giant has a supply quota of 5.4 million
barrels a day.
   Analysts said the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Nigeria and
Libya also have the capacity to lift production.
   Armas said his country will increase pumping to fill its stocks
because of the possibility that the oil crunch will continue for
some time.
   Analysts say Venezuela could add as much as 500,000 barrels a
day to its OPEC quota of 1.9 million barrels.
   OPEC nations are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

   Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor threatened
to walk out on a concert if ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was played
beforehand. She won the battle but lost the war.
   The national anthem was not played, but the singer known for her
skinhead-style haircut was banned from any future performances at
the Garden State Arts Center, officials said.
   Backstage staff relented following the ultimatum Friday out of
fear that a last-minute cancellation would cause a commotion, said
Dennis Ingoglia, a spokesman for the New Jersey Highway Authority,
which operates the 9,000-seat venue.
   O'Connor, whose recordings include ``Nothing Compares 2 U'' and
``Mandinka,'' gave no reason for her demand, Ingoglia said.
   A telephone message left this morning at the offices of
O'Connor's publicist, Elaine Schock, was not immediately returned
this morning.
   But today's editions of USA Today quoted O'Connor as saying: ``I
don't see what (anthems) have to do with me or my music or my
fans.''
   She said she ``didn't mean to be disrespectful'' but wouldn't
perform after any national anthem, even Ireland's. She said she had
been unaware that the Garden State Arts Center routinely plays the
U.S. anthem before shows.
   She added some criticism of U.S. policy on arts funding: ``I
feel very strongly about censorship, and I don't want to go onstage
after the anthem of a country that's arresting people and harassing
people for expressing themselves onstage.''
   George Zilocchi, acting executive director of the highway
authority, said in a statement: ``No performer who does not agree
to have the national anthem played will be allowed to perform.''
   In May, O'Connor refused to perform on ``Saturday Night Live''
because the guest host was controversial comedian Andrew Dice Clay,
whose off-color humor, much of it at the expense of women, earlier
prompted cast member Nora Dunn to boycott the show.

   A predicted teacher shortage probably will not
materialize because many veterans who left the profession are
returning, a study said today.
   The National Center for Education Information said more than a
third, 38 percent, of current public school teachers have had at
least one break from teaching.
   Nearly half, 46 percent, of new teachers hired since 1985 have
had at least one break, and 18 percent of these have had two or
more breaks.
   ``Teaching appears to be a revolving door,'' the study said.
   ``There is absolutely no question'' that statistics projecting
teacher shortages are not accurate, said Emily Feistritzer,
director of the center, an independent, non-partisan research
group. She said little attention has been paid to the ``returning
teacher phenomenon.''
   ``All this business of teachers being miserable and leaving is
not being borne out in data anywhere,''' she said.
   The study analyzed the results of a 58-question survey of 3,201
current elementary and secondary school teachers _ 2,380 public
school teachers, 469 teachers who had participated in alternative
teacher certification programs in Texas and New Jersey and 352
private school teachers.
   Alternative teacher certification programs are for people who
did not earn a college degree in teaching. Twelve percent of those
teachers who were hired in the last five years have taught before.
   The study also showed:
   _The teaching force in America is getting older, whiter and more
female. The average age of all public school teachers is 42 years;
of new teachers hired since 1985, the average age is 35 years.
Ninety-two percent of all public school teachers are white and 71
percent are women.
   _To become a teacher, alternative routes attract minorities more
than traditional certification routes. Forty-three percent of the
teachers from the Texas alternative route and 20 percent from the
New Jersey alternate route are minorities.
   _Alternate route teachers are much more willing to teach in
inner cities than those coming through traditional programs. A
third, 33 percent, of alternate route teachers say they would be
willing to teach in large inner cities, compared with 12 percent of
the new hires from traditional programs and 12 percent of all
current public school teachers.
   Since most teachers are women, Feistritzer said childbearing was
listed most often as the reason for taking a break from teaching.
   About three-fourths of all teachers said they chose the
profession because of a ``desire to work with young people.''
   Ninety-three percent of the private school teachers said they
were satisfied with their jobs. That compared with 89 percent of
the alternative route teachers in Texas and New Jersey, 87 percent
of the returning teachers and 83 percent of all public school
teachers.
   There are 2.3 million public school teachers and another 300,000
private school teachers. Some education-related groups are
predicting a shortage, based on teacher attrition, increasing
student enrollments and fewer college graduates seeking teaching
jobs.
   Thanks to Teachers, an organization sponsored by the National
Education Association and private business groups, reports that
many school districts already are reporting shortages. The group
says far too few college students are enrolled in teacher training
programs to fill the expected 1.3 million teaching job openings
expected by 1994.
   Other studies have estimated that about 200,000 new teachers
would be needed a year.
   However, Feistritzer said about 650,000 teachers have been hired
in the last five years, averaging out to 130,000 a year. About
71,000 of those hired each year are new teachers.
   In the study, 74 percent of all teachers said they expect to be
teaching five years from now. Eight percent plan to retire, 7
percent expect to switch to an occupation outside of education, 10
percent expect to be in another occupation in education, 1 percent
plan to be homemaking or raising children full time and 1 percent
expect to be attending a college or university full time.

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Rose 3.3 Percent in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of existing homes rose 3.3 percent in
July, their second straight increase, as mortgage rates dropped
into the single digits, a real estate trade group reported today.
   The National Association of Realtors said house resales totaled
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units compared to
June's rate of 3.33 million.
   The 0.9 percent gain in sales in June was the first advance in
seven months.
   Fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages fell from 10.06 percent to 9.8
percent during July, according to surveys conducted by the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. However, they turned upward after the Aug.
2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and reached 10.29 percent by last Friday.
   ``Home buyers watched rates keep drifting down and started
making their move,'' Realtors' President Norman D. Flynn said.
``The rate drops brought in some borderline buyers who were priced
out of the market earlier this year, as well as buyers who could
have bought sooner, but chose to wait out the rate increases.''
   But Flynn said the recent rate increases probably will push down
sales this month.
   ``Iraq's craziness will be felt in U.S. housing markets,'' he
said.
   The national median existing-home price was $98,400 in July, up
0.9 percent from June. The median price means half of the homes
cost more, half less.
   Sales increases were posted both in the Northeast and South. In
the Northeast, the pace jumped 14.3 percent to 560,000 units, while
it gained 6.9 percent in the South to 1.40 million units.
   ``July's build-up in resales (in the Northeast) was the result
of greater activity in the lower price ranges,'' according to John
A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist. ``Sellers have adjusted
their prices to fit a buyer's market and buyers have responded.''
   The median price in the Northeast was $143,300 in July, 3.4
percent below the June level.
   The resale increase in the South reflected rising activity in
the Southwest, Tuccillo said, where several formerly depressed
oil-dominated markets are springing back. The median price in the
South was $88,900, up 1.6 percent from June.
   Sales fell 10.3 percent, to 520,000 units, in the West. The
median price there was $141,500, up 2.5 percent from the previous
month.
   Sales fell 3.1 percent in the Midwest, to 930,000 units. The
median price there was $76,300, up 0.5 percent from June.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands Strike to Protest Violence</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with scene at mass funeral, comments from
Desmond Tutu, 10 deaths reported over weekend in Natal province.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of blacks in the
Soweto township stayed away from work today to protest factional
fighting that has claimed more than 500 lives over the past two
weeks.
   Buses, taxis and trains in Soweto were carrying roughly a third
as many passengers as usual into neighboring Johannesburg. Many
schools were closed and the main streets in the township of 2.5
million people were mostly empty.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, addressing a funeral for seven
people killed in the violence, told a roaring crowd that police
actions, not tribal divisions, were fueling the conflict.
   ``We have never quarreled because of tribalism,'' Tutu told some
5,000 African National Congress supporters at a Soweto
amphitheater. ``The evidence is overwhelming that the police have
not been impartial.''
   Most of the fighting in Soweto and other townships around
Johannesburg has pitted Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
movement against Xhosas and other blacks who support the ANC, the
country's largest black political organization.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid figures have
accused police of siding with Inkatha, a charge police deny.
   The government and many neutral observers portray the conflict
as mostly tribal fighting linked to the power struggle between the
ANC and Inkatha.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has blamed the ANC for
instigating the fighting, which has resulted in some of the worst
violence since nationwide unrest during the mid-1980s. Buthelezi
says the ANC wants to crush all opposition.
   ``Our freedom is at hand,'' Tutu said to tumultuous cheers.
``And there are those (whites) who say they don't want us to have
our freedom ... so they have made us fight one another.''
   Heavily armed soldiers and police ringed the amphitheater. No
arrests or violence were reported.
   The general strike was called by the anti-apartheid Soweto Civic
Association to ``protest the violence, police behavior and to mourn
our dead.'' Residents in neighboring townships also took part.
   A group of Xhosa and Zulu tribal chiefs sympathetic to the ANC
toured the townships Sunday and said the violence was ``not a
Zulu-Xhosa conflict, but has its roots in the system of apartheid.''
   ``The problem is the collaboration between the police and
Inkatha,'' said Mwelo Nonkonyana, a Xhosa chief.
   The delegation, which included seven Xhosa and six Zulu chiefs,
said it did not represent any political party. But the chiefs all
belong to the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa, a
group with close ties to the ANC.
   The Zulus and the Xhosas are the two largest tribes in South
Africa, but townships in the Johannesburg area have blacks from all
10 major tribes in the country.
   Townships around Johannesburg have been relatively peaceful in
recent days for the first time since the violence erupted Aug. 12.
A total of 515 blacks have died, including more than 100 in Soweto,
police said.
   Army troops and police continued to patrol the streets and
confiscate guns, spears, axes and other weapons. The government has
declared townships ringing Johannesburg ``unrest areas,'' giving
police wide powers to curb violence.
   The government lifted a state of emergency in three provinces in
June, but retained the measures in the eastern province of Natal,
where fighting between Inkatha and ANC forces has claimed about
5,000 lives in the past five years.
   In Natal, seven blacks were hacked and stabbed to death and
three were fatally shot over the weekend in separate attacks,
police said.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, the
5 million whites dominate politics and the economy, and the black
majority has no voice in national affairs.

islands.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gustav's winds hit 105 mph early today as
the storm headed for the Caribbean, and warnings were posted in the
West Indies.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Gustav, which reached hurricane strength on
Sunday, was about 205 miles east of Guadeloupe. It was moving
northwest at nearly 9 mph and was expected to maintain that course
and speed for the next 24 hours, foecasters said.
   Gustav was on a path that would skirt the Leeward Islands, and
hurricane forecasters said the island residents were likely to feel
its effects.
   ``It would be close enough that they need to watch it. They
would be on the fringes,'' said Mark Zimmer, a specialist at the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``Conditions
are favorable for further strengthening.''
   The islands of Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis
and St. Kitts issued hurricane warnings late Sunday. A hurricane
watch was in effect for St. Martin, Anguilla and surrounding
islands but dropped today for Dominica and Martinique.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Hortense trailed Gustav about a
thousand miles to the east in the mid-Atlantic, an immediate danger
only to shipping.
   Hortense, the eighth named storm of the Atlantic season, had
winds of 45 mph at 6 a.m. today and was not expected to gain
strength today. It was moving north at about 5 mph.
   Gustav and Hortense were born as tropical depressions near the
Cape Verde islands off West Africa. Such storms have been among
history's worst.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.

   Vandals desecrated 172 gravestones
in separate incidents at two Roman Catholic cemeteries, police said
today. No arrests have been made.
   Youths knocked over and smashed 115 tombstones and ornaments at
the Sint Martinus Cemetery in Eindhoven Saturday night, said police
spokesman Herman van Zanten.
   Late Friday night, 57 monuments were damaged at a Roman Catholic
graveyard in Oudenbosch, 43 miles from Eindhoven, said Fred
Rietveld, another police spokesman.
   Cemetery vandalism has increased in the south of the
Netherlands, which is predominantly Roman Catholic, since the
mutilation of corpses at a Jewish cemetery in France and other
graveyard attacks in Europe this year, Rietveld said. But he said
police do not know the motive.
   Last week, an art student and a friend were arrested after they
dug up a skull at another cemetery in Eindhoven, said Van Zanten.
They said they wanted to use it as a drawing model.

   Divers searched today for the bodies of 35
people presumed drowned when an overcrowded pleasure boat on a
moon-gazing cruise capsized, killing 57 people.
   Most of the 34 people who survived the accident on picturesque
Sun Moon Lake in Nantou, about 160 miles southwest of Taipei, were
rescued by another boat.
   One woman swam the 1,650 feet to shore Saturday night, said
Jonathan D. Crossman, the British president of Shell Taiwan Ltd.,
who was on board when the accident occurred. He said earlier police
reports that the accident occurred 165 feet from shore were wrong.
   The pleasure boat was chartered by the Taiwan Shell subsidiary
for its employees. The weekend excursion occurred on the eve of the
Chinese Valentine Day Festival, during which moon-gazing is
traditional.
   Crossman said 57 people, including 18 children, drowned. Shell
officials said all 91 people on board the boat, except for two
travel agents and the helmsman, were Shell employees and their
families. The company earlier said 88 people were on board.
   Police arrested helmsman Hsu Ching-hsing for alleged
unintentional manslaughter after he was rescued. Hsu, who also
owned the boat, attributed the accident to strong winds. But police
said the boat carried more than its 60-person capacity.
   The cruiser was also in breach of a 6 p.m. deadline banning
boats from using the lake, officials said.
   Crossman said from his hotel room in Nantou today that about 20
people drowned after they were crushed under the overturned boat.
Others drowned apparently because they could not swim.
   Crossman, 44, said he was tossed overboard from an upper deck.
He grabbed his 7-year-old daughter, Nicola, in his arms and both
were rescued. His wife, Julia, 40, and a son, Robert, 6, drowned.

   A helicopter crashed into a hill near a
resort concert hall this morning, killing five people including
members of rock star Eric Clapton's entourage, authorities said.
   Clapton was not aboard the helicopter, said Al Zimmerman, chief
dispatcher of the Walworth County Sheriff's Department. But
officials could not immediately say whether two other famed
guitarists on the bill with Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Robert
Cray, were aboard.
   Identities of the victims won't be released until relatives are
notified, authorities said.
   The crash site was in a ski hill at Alpine Valley, a ski resort
and outdoor theater complex about six miles southwest of this
southeastern Wisconsin town. Clapton, along with Cray and Vaughan,
had played at the theater Sunday evening.
   The helicopter, owned by Omni Flight Helicopters Inc., crashed
into a field about 12:35 a.m. shortly after leaving the Alpine
Valley music theater, said Omni spokesman Phil Huth.
   ``The helicopter was transporting a pilot and members of Eric
Clapton's band,'' Huth said in releasing a prepared statement.
   Clapton was staying this morning at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Chicago, and was not available for immediate comment, said his tour
manager, Peter Jackson.
   Jackson, who sounded distraught and strained when reached by
phone in his room at the hotel, said Clapton learned of the
accident when ``one of our planes never arrived at the airport.''
He declined to identify the victims.
   A spokeswoman for sheriff's department said the helicopter was
reported missing at 5 a.m. and the wreckage was found at about 7
a.m.
   The spokeswoman, Pat Salimas, said the copter was one of four at
Alpine Valley that were scheduled to fly during the night to Midway
Airport at Chicago.
   The helicopter crashed into the the back of a ski hill and an
electronic signal was activated, notifying the Civil Air Patrol of
the crash, she said.
   Huth confirmed the helicopter was headed to Chicago.
   Huth said the cause of the crash was not immediately known.
   Vaughan, with his band Double Trouble, had a platinum album for
``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' released in 1984. He's known for
songs like ``Pride and Joy'' and won a 1984 Grammy Award for best
traditional blues recording in 1984. This year, he won a Grammy in
the contemporary blues category for ``In Step.''
   Cray won a Grammy in 1988 in the contemporary blues category for
the hit album ``Strong Persuader.'' The following year, he won in
the same category for the single ``Don't Be Afraid of the Dark.''
   Clapton, 45, rose to international fame in the '60s for his
pounding blues guitar style, first with the British blues groups
the Yardbirds and John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.
   Teaming with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, he formed the group
Cream in the late 60s, best known for its album ``Wheels of Fire''
and the single ``Sunshine of Your Love.'' Later, he was with the
group Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos before pursuing a solo
career.
   Among his other well-known songs as ``Layla,'' ``Lay Down,
Sally,'' ``I Shot the Sheriff'' and ``Tulsa Time.''
   He was born in Surrey, England, on March 30, 1945. He was
married to Patti Boyd, who previously was married to Beatle George
Harrison.

<HEAD>New Study: Alternate Routes Attract Minorities, Inner-City
Teachers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers who enter the profession without a
college degree in teaching are more likely to be minorities and to
want to work in inner-city schools, according to a study released
Monday.
   A third of the teachers who took an alternate route to the
classroom say they'd be willing to work in large inner cities,
compared to 12 percent of all current public school teachers and 12
percent of new hires from traditional programs, according to the
study by the National Center for Education Information.
   The independent, non-partisan reserach group looked at
alternative certification plans in two states as part of a larger
teacher study. It found that 43 percent of the non-traditional
teachers in Texas and 20 percent of those in New Jersey were
minorities.
   The overall teaching force is becoming older, whiter and more
female, the study found. The average age of all public school
teachers is 42 years; of new teachers hired since 1985, the average
age is 35 years. Ninety-two percent of all public school teachers
are white and 71 percent are women.
   The study of 3,201 elementary and secondary school teachers
currently on the job also concluded that a predicted teaching
shortage probably will not occur because many teachers who leave
the profession tend to return.
   Of the teachers in the study, 38 percent have had at least one
break from teaching; 46 percent of those hired since 1985 have had
one break and 18 percent of these have had two or more breaks.
   ``Teaching appears to be a revolving door,'' the study said.
   Center director Emily Feistritzer said childbearing was listed
most often as the reason for taking a break from teaching. She said
more attention should be paid to the ``returning teacher
phenomenon.''
   ``All this business of teachers being miserable and leaving is
not being borne out in data anywhere,''' she said.
   There are 2.3 million public school teachers and another 300,000
private school teachers in the United States. Some
education-related groups are predicting a shortage due to teacher
attrition, increasing student enrollments and fewer college
graduates seeking teaching jobs.
   Thanks to Teachers, an organization sponsored by the National
Education Association and private business groups, reports that
many school districts already are reporting shortages. The group
says far too few college students are enrolled in teacher-training
programs to fill the expected 1.3 million teaching job openings
expected by 1994.
   Other studies have estimated that about 200,000 new teachers
would be needed a year.
   However, Feistritzer said about 650,000 teachers have been hired
in the last five years, averaging out to 130,000 a year. About
71,000 of those hired each year are new teachers.
   Three-quarters of the teachers in her study said they expect to
be teaching five years from now. Ten percent predicted they'd be in
an education-related occupation, 7 percent plan to switch fields
and 8 percent expect to retire.
   The Feistritzer study is based on the results of a 58-question
survey of 2,380 public school teachers, 352 private school teachers
and 469 people who had participated in the Texas and New Jersey
alternate-route programs.

   Drunken students hurled beer and bottles at
police and an ambulance rescuing an injured teen-ager at a
fraternity party, authorities said.
   ``It's superirresponsible on the part of the individuals to do
that when they were trying to get to someone who's hurt,'' said
police Sgt. Jack Phillips.
   Police made about five arrests among a crowd estimated at 7,500
attending Saturday night's bash, an annual event in the fraternity
and sorority section near the University of Missouri's campus.
   Mitchell Stegmaier, 17, of Columbia was in serious condition at
a Columbia hospital. He took a dare from people who said a $100
bill was on top of the utility pole and was nearly electrocuted
when he got tangled in the high-voltage wires, witnesses said.
   A transformer exploded, jarring Stegmaier from the pole. But he
became entangled in a lower set of wires before dropping to the
ground, said Phillips.
   A police patrol car and ambulance tried to get through the
crowd, but partygoers started throwing rocks and bottles, Phillips
said.
   The rear window and windshield of the patrol car were smashed,
Phillips said. The ambulance windshield also was smashed and a
firefighter was hit by a beer can, Phillips said.
   University Chancellor Haskell Monroe said, ``It is a horrible
tragedy. We want to eliminate the likelihood that this will ever
happen again.''
   Meetings were planned for this week between fraternity leaders
and administrators.

   Pope John Paul II discussed Polish politics
Monday in a long meeting with Lech Walesa, a leader of the
Solidarity labor movement.
   It was the fifth encounter between the two Poles since John Paul
became pope in 1978.
   Walesa ``presented a panorama of the present situation in
Poland, 10 years after the birth of Solidarity,'' said papal
spokesman Joaquin Navarro.
   ``It is a situation of a free and pluralistic society that
appears full of hope for the future,'' Navarro said to sum up
Walesa's view as expressed to the pope.
   Walesa attended a Mass celebrated by John Paul in the papal
summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, a tpwm outside Rome. The two,
along with Tadeusz Goclowski, the bishop of Walesa's hometown of
Gdansk, then had breakfast together.
   Walesa and the pope then talked privately for more than an hour,
Navarro said.
   The Polish labor leader said the men discussed politics in a
general discussion ``about the role of Christianity and other
themes.''
   In a homily Sunday, the pope called on Poles to fight ``moral
permissiveness'' and to encourage the teaching of religion in
schools.
   Walesa was in Italy for a convention held by a conservative
religious organization.

<HEAD>Former East German Economics Czar Released from Custody</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's former Communist economics
czar, who is accused of corruption, has been released from prison
because of failing health, officials said Monday.
   Doctors agreed that Guenter Mittag, 63, was too ill to remain in
jail where he was being held in preventive custody, said East
German justice officials who asked not to be identified.
   Mittag was responsible for economic policy in the Communist
government that was ousted during last fall's pro-democracy
movement. He had been in prison since December and is accused of
corruption and sabotaging the country's economy.
   Other top officials under investigation by the new
democratically elected government include former Communist leader
Erich Honecker and longtime security chief Erich Mielke.
   Mittag suffers from acute diabetes, said East German justice
officials.
   He is considered to be the most ill of all the former Communist
party leaders under investigation.

<HEAD>Government Critic Rearrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A well-known critic of the government who
was free on bail on a sedition charge was rearrested Monday on
another charge for which he already has served a prison sentence.
   Gitobu Imanyara, a lawyer who edits a monthly magazine, was
charged with misappropriating a client's funds, said his attorney,
John Khaminwa.
   Imanyara was convicted of essentially the same charge in 1984
and served two years of a five-year sentence. The case stemmed from
a complaint by a client to the Law Society. The Society dismissed
the complaint as groundless.
   The 37-year-old lawyer has angered the government by defending
120 members of the air force who were charged with treason in
connection with a failed 1982 coup.
   More recently, Imanyara has irked officials through his
magazine, The Nairobi Law Monthly, which is frequently critical of
the government. He was detained in a crackdown in July and held in
jail for 20 days without charge.
   Immediately upon his release, he was arrested and charged with
sedition in connection with the July issue of the magazine, which
was devoted to multiparty politics, law and democracy. He was freed
on bail on that charge on July 31.

<TEXT>
   Saudi Arabia, a strictly controlled
society, has opened the floodgates to more than 250 reporters,
turning coverage of the U.S. troop deployment into what one
journalist called Monday ``a media war.''
   The decision to let American and foreign journalists roam the
oil-rich kingdom is unprecedented.
   ``It's phenomenal,'' said Ray Wilkinson, Newsweek's Cairo-based
correspondent. Wilkinson had a visa request pending for 18 months
before he was granted one. ``I never thought I would see the U.S.
military in Saudi Arabia, and I never thought I would see us here
like this.''
   Saudi officials, speaking on condition they not be identified,
said the change in government policy came from the highest levels
and was partly in reaction to pressure from the United States.
   ``They know public opinion is important,'' one official said of
the Saudi leadership. ``Pressure from the White House'' also played
a role, he said.
   Most reporters have been given monthlong visas.
   After a month, the situation is fluid, although one Saudi
official said it's possible major news organizations will be given
a permanent presence in the kingdom.
   The arrival of hundreds of journalists prompted the U.S. Defense
Department to disband its 17-member media pool Sunday, two weeks
after the first journalists arrived in the country. Under the pool
arrangement, writers, photographers and television journalists made
their work available to all news organizations.
   Some pool reporters complained about restrictions imposed by the
Pentagon but praised the access they were given to on-the-ground
operations.
   Most irksome was the Pentagon's initial prohibition on the use
of soldiers' names and hometowns. On Saturday, the Pentagon lifted
the ban, saying the military situation had relaxed.
   The Pentagon and the Saudi government still bar reporters from
using exact locations when writing about military activities.
   Navy Lt. Cmdr. Gregg Hartung, the pool coordinator, said he
thought the pool worked better than in the past. During the
December invasion of Panama, for example, reporters were furious at
being penned up away from any action for 24 hours.
   ``I think we still have room for improvement,'' Hartung said.
For instance, he would have liked daily briefings with ``Operation
Desert Shield'' commanders to give the pool up-to-date details of
the deployment.
   But that was impossible because the operation was run out of
Riyadh, the Saudi capital, while the reporters were based 200 miles
away in Dhahran, scene of the major deployment.
   The invasion of reporters has created a new set of headaches for
American and Saudi officials.
   So many people are vying for limited space on official tours,
such as the visit to see three Republican senators, that the
Pentagon has given first priority to American reporters.
   The Saudis have also been besieged by reporters trying to get on
sponsored trips. A near riot broke out among reporters pushing to
get on buses when the Saudis took a group to the border with Iraq.
   ``It's a media war. That's the main feature,'' said Alix Van
Buren of La Repubblica of Italy.
   ``Bring in a couple thousand copies of `Scoop,''' said Time
Magazine's Jay Peterzell, referring to Evelyn Waugh's satirical
novel about covering an African war. ``A lot of people want to
reread it.''

<HEAD>Gingrich Breaks With Bush, Returns To Anti-Tax Roots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After flirting with a tax increase and drawing
political fire back home in Georgia, House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich is breaking with the Bush administration and returning to
his anti-tax political roots.
   Gingrich, one of the GOP's most fervent anti-tax crusaders
during the 1980s, says he will propose billions of dollars in tax
cuts when White House and congressional budget negotiations resume
next month.
   ``I think this kind of a tax package represents the best lessons
of the 1980s in how to get economic growth and it avoids the
greatest dangers of the 1970s, which were to raise taxes going
straight into a recession,'' he said last week.
   Gingrich's announcement comes just a month after he told budget
negotiators he would co-sponsor and help line up GOP votes for a
$50 billion defiit reduction plan that included up to $25 billion
in new taxes.
   That was the target budget negotiators agreed to shoot for after
President Bush in June abandoned his no-tax-increase pledge and
announced that new tax revenues were needed to reduce the deficit,
which is projected to reach $170 billion in fiscal 1991.
   Gingrich initially was outraged by Bush's reversal, calling it a
mistake that will result in ``a severe blow to the president's
credibility and a significant blow to the Republican Party.''
   But he later bowed to administration pressure, donned his House
leadership hat and agreed to help Bush strike a deficit reduction
deal with congressional Democrats.
   He said at the time he could support a budget agreement with up
to $25 billion in new tax revenues if it doesn't raise income tax
rates and includes spending cuts, budget reforms, adequate defense
spending and a capital gains tax cut.
   Gingrich's willingness to support new taxes, however, quickly
became a major issue in his re-election campaign in Georgia's 6th
District.
   Democrat David Worley, making his second try to unseat Gingrich,
has blasted him repeatedly for backing higher taxes in Washington
while pledging in fund-raising appeals to fight new taxes. He says
Gingrich is proposing tax cuts now ``because he knows he's in
trouble at home on the tax issue.''
   But Gingrich said his new tax stance is simply a recognition
that the ``equation has changed'' in the past month because of the
Persian Gulf crisis and increasing evidence that the economy is
headed into a recession.
   ``I'd find it very hard to understand an argument for a tax
increase in the face of a weak economy,'' he said.
   Gingrich concedes that the administration isn't excited about
his tax cut proposal. Neither is his fellow GOP budget negotiator,
Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the senior Republican on the House
Budget Committee.
   ``I think it is interesting theology and I love tax cuts, but I
am not sure tax cuts are indicated at this stage of the game,''
Frenzel said in a telephone interview.
   Frenzel said a move toward tax cuts now likely would be
interpreted by the credit markets here and abroad as an abandonment
of efforts to reduce the deficit.
   And if that happened, he said, interest rates would rise because
``we will be considered an unwise risk for creditors and we will
find that we have an interest-rate induced recession.''
   Frenzel agreed with Gingrich that worsening economic conditions,
coupled with the military crisis precipitated by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, have changed the dynamics of the budget negotiations.
   ``Almost everybody who did not want a successful budget
agreement has a lot better reason to keep us from getting one,'' he
said. ``But to me, they're all less significant than the reason
that we started with, and that is that we have a fiscal policy that
is out of control.''

<HEAD>Demonstrators Burn Party Headquarters</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with police instructed to use force,
Socialist Party rally, details. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria's police were instructed today
to use force if necessary to prevent further violence a day after
anti-Communist demonstrators torched and ransacked the governing
Socialist Party headquarters.
   Hundreds of police stood guard around the partially gutted
building, blocking off access to the nearby government offices and
the presidential palace.
   The Socialist Party held a rally in downtown Sofia near party
headquarters this evening, apparently designed to show its strength
despite the attack. Thousands attended, a state radio reporter said.
   The party headquarters was set ablaze late Sunday by a small
group of demonstrators who broke away from a larger anti-Communist
protest, throwing torches into its windows.
   They were incensed by the red star _ the symbol of Communist,
one-party rule _ on top of the building. The Socialist Party is the
heir to the Communist Party, which changed its name earlier this
year in a bid to retain power.
   Reformers in the party ousted hard-line Communist leader Todor
Zhivkov in November, and won a majority in June nationwide
elections under the Socialist banner.
   The main opposition group condemned the assault today and said
it could endanger the transition to democracy.
   ``Do not let yourselves be provoked, keep the public peace, calm
down the impatient,'' the Union of Democratic Forces said in a
statement carried by the official BTA news agency. ``Let us show in
these dramatic hours that we are sensible and civilized people.''
   Several firemen and bystanders near the burning building were
injured by falling debris, a doctor on the scene reported. One
demonstrator said police clubbed protesters inside the building,
but there was no word of casualties.
   The general prosecutor's office said today that more than 50
people had been arrested.
   The targeted building, dating to the 1950s, is Sofia's largest
and had been the Communists' headquarters.
   In the protest, demonstrators shouted ``Down with the
Communists,'' while others threw burning torches through windows of
the building, witnesses said.
   Inside, in areas of the headquarters untouched by flames,
protesters destroyed furniture, and hurled papers and other items
onto the street.
   State radio said looters later came to carry off television sets
and computers from the building.
   Firefighters said demonstrators blocked their way and cut most
of their hoses. The fire was eventually extinguished early today,
more than five hours after it began.
   President Zhelyu Zhelev cut short a holiday in the Black Sea
resort of Varna and went on national radio to appeal for calm.
   The country is in danger of ``drifting ... into a military
dictatorship,'' Zhelev said in an appeal for law and order.
   As firefighters fought to control the blaze Sunday night, the
commander of the national police announced that the main roads into
Sofia had been closed to all but those on official business. Today,
vehicles were allowed to pass after their occupants produced
identification.
   Bulgarian media carried a statement issued by the unidentified
commander announcing that police across the nation had been placed
on alert ``so that no similar incidents happen in other regions.''
   The crowd outside the building swelled to as many as 10,000
people at one point. About 800 police officers armed with clubs
watched but made no move to disperse the crowd.
   Vice President Atanas Semerdzhiev, a Socialist, ordered police
not to use force against the protesters.
   Before it was brought under control, the fire spread to two
neighboring buildings belonging to the Socialist Party. Firemen
said several apartments in nearby residential buildings also caught
fire.
   Last week, the Parliament voted to remove red stars and other
Communist symbols from buildings after an activist threatened to
set himself on fire.
   The activist, 20-year-old Plamen Stanchev, said he would burn
himself by 9 p.m. Sunday unless all Communist symbols had
disappeared.
   When the deadline passed without removal of the red star from
the party headquarters, he poured what witnesses said was a
flammable liquid over himself but was prevented from striking a
match.
   A small group of demonstrators set fire to the building less
than 30 minutes later, the witnesses said.
   The Socialists were the only former Communist Party in Eastern
Europe to win elections after the democratic upheaval that swept
the region last year.
   But the Socialists have seen their popularity steadily erode
since the elections as the country's economy deteriorates.

   A young college student was found slain
in her apartment early today, hours after police found two other
young women dead in another apartment near the University of
Florida, authorities said.
   Investigators did not immediately link the three slayings. The
apartments are less than two miles apart on the south side of
Gainesville.
   ``We're exploring that possibility, but right now we just don't
know,'' said police Lt. Sadie Darnell.
   The three slayings on the eve of the fall term prompted parents
to flood the university community with worried calls. ``We're
receiving calls from all over, particularly from out-of-state
parents,'' said Darnell.
   UF spokeswoman Linda Gray said the school also was getting many
calls.
   Deputies went to the lone woman's apartment in nearby Alachua
County after she failed to report to work at midnight, said
sheriff's spokesman Spencer Mann. He said she was 18 and a student
at nearby Santa Fe Community College.
   Mann said there was trauma to the body, but he would not say how
she died.
   University officials did not immediately confirm a published
report that the other two victims were incoming UF freshmen.
   The bodies of the other two women were found Sunday when the
parents of one had police and a maintenance man open the apartment
door. The parents had been unable to contact their daughter all
weekend.
   The two women were nude and suffered violent deaths sometime
during the weekend, according to Ms. Darnell. She said police had
no suspects in the case.
   She said the bodies suffered multiple traumas, but there were no
obvious signs of gunshot wounds although police weren't ruling out
the possibility. The victims' identities were not released.
   Both victims found Sunday were incoming University of Florida
freshmen, the Gainesville Sun newspaper reported today. Classes
began at the university today.

   Against a desperate tide of refugees
fleeing Kuwait, a widening stream of Jordanian Palestinians are
heading the other way, seeking fortunes in what they see as a
promising province of Iraq.
   ``A little more stability comes each day in Kuwait, and
Palestinians are taking advantage,'' said Khanchand Ahuja, an
electrical engineer who left behind six years of Kuwaiti life to
take his family home to India.
   Heavily laden sedans join the trucks carrying grain and steel
through this besieged outpost to Iraq.
   ``About 2,000 people crossed into Iraq on Sunday,'' reported a
senior security official at the border station. ``This is picking
up fast.''
   Refugees agreed that because of tumultuous conditions,
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait is ripe for adventuresome job-seekers,
entrepreneurs and criminals.
   They said hoodlums from among the large Palestinian population
joined Iraqi troops in the first wave of looting and are now
stealing property at gunpoint, despite Iraqi attempts to restore
order.
   Other Palestinians are buying up refugees' electronic goods,
furniture and clothing to resell in Baghdad for big profits.
   Hatem Elagha, a young Palestinian leaving his native Kuwait to
study in Georgia, said many Jordanian Palestinians who were on
vacation or who fled after the invasion are returning.
   ``Things are stabilizing some, and they want to protect their
jobs and family holdings,'' he said. ``The politics don't matter to
them.''
   An estimated 350,000 Jordanians, mostly Palestinians, were
settled in Kuwait at the time Iraq invaded and annexed it.
Officials said 12,000 of them left, but many are going back.
   Among many Jordanians, political sympathies clearly lie with
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's declared championship of the Arab
cause.
   The 150-mile two-lane blacktop road between the Jordanian
capital, Amman, and Ruweishid is not only the escape route from
Iraq and Kuwait but also a lifeline that Jordanian road crews are
hard at work improving.
   On a drive to the border, reporters saw a dozen trucks loaded to
capacity with heavy steel I-beams and angle iron, useful for
building artillery platforms, bunkers and bridges for tanks. There
also were open trucks piled high with wheat.
   At an off-limits section of the border crossing, reporters saw
several heavy covered commercial trucks roll into Iraq in the
predawn darkness.
   Officials neither confirm nor deny that goods are crossing into
Iraq in spite of U.N. sanctions.
   On a few buses, the drivers could hardly see around huge
portraits of Saddam taped to the windshield.
   ``This problem came on an American wind, and we are all with
Saddam,'' said Dr. Ahmed Dagens, a Jordanian helping treat refugees
in a makeshift Red Crescent first aid center. His three colleagues
nodded in agreement.
   Refugees agreed that essential items were rapidly disappearing
from the market in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``Kuwait is in a terrible state, terrible,'' said an Indian
petrochemical engineer who spoke freely when assured he would not
be named. ``I don't see how it can hold out.''
   He said Kuwait relied on two water treatment plants and two
power stations.
   ``Soon the filters and parts will go, or the water works could
be hit by a bomb,'' he said. ``The electrical plants could stop.
Without water and refrigeration, a million people could die.''
   Ahuja confirmed that Kuwait's essential services were crippled,
but he said Iraq was making major efforts to bring stability.
   Looters were hanged in the market, discouraging further raids,
he said. Bread shops and banks were opening one at a time. Iraqi
officers took over abandoned police stations.
   People described mass destruction when Iraqi forces rolled into
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``They smashed everything, and carried away everything they
could,'' the Indian engineer said.
   He said he watched thirsty troops looking for cold drinks break
open what they thought was a refrigerator. It was a computer worth
a half-million dollars.

   Finally, there's sportswear for the cow conscious.
   The Milk Advisory Board is introducing leotards, shorts and
other clothing adorned with the likeness of the Holstein milk cow's
black-and-white splotches.
   Holsteins _ and all things cowlike _ are hot, retailers say.
   ``People love cows,'' said Connie Begg of J.J.'s Mae Inc., the
San Francisco manufacturer that's producing the garments.
   The advisory board based in South San Francisco views the
promotion strictly as a way of pushing milk, not clothes.
   Each item carries a tag telling the bovine buyer: ``This garment
is patterned after the unique markings of the Holstein dairy cow _
to remind you that milk does a body good.''
   Cow-print leotards and shorts showed up earlier this year on
billboards advertising extra light milk. The ads prompted inquiries
from people wanting cow-print clothing, said Adri Boudewyn of the
Milk Advisory Board.
   The clothing items include $12.50 T-shirts with the advisory

   ``People can have a cow,'' he said. ``Or they can have the whole

   Eight U.S. senators paid a visit today to
American troops in Saudi Arabia and said support for their
deployment remains strong back home.
   ``You're not here alone, this is an international effort,''
Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn told a handful of
Marines. ``This is the world against Saddam Hussein.''
   Later, Nunn told reporters that a briefing the senators received
from American and Saudi military commanders had convinced him a
sufficient force was in place to deter an Iraqi attack on Saudi
Arabia.
   ``An Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia would be national suicide,''
said Nunn, D-Ga.
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, asked if he came away from
the briefings convinced a sufficient military force was in place to
defeat Iraqi troops to the north, said: ``I think so. If not, it's
getting real close.''
   From Saudi Arabia, the senators were headed to Alexandria,
Egypt, for meetings with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Nunn said the senators would discuss the need for a bigger,
multinational force in Saudi Arabia with Arabs on the front lines
but did not answer directly when asked whether he thought Egypt
should send more troops.
   Of an bigger Arab role on the front line, Nunn said: ``I think
that's important militarily but also, more importantly, politically
and psychologically.''
   Several of the senators, when asked by reporters, acknowledged
that the presence of American hostages in Iraq complicated efforts
to resolve the nearly month-old Middle East standoff.
   But they said the hostage situation alone could not be the force
behind U.S. policy.
   ``You can't run foreign policy on hostages,'' said Sen. Jake
Garn, R-Utah. ``If you did, no American would be safe anywhere in
the world.''
   The senators visited troops at an airbase in northeast Saudi
Arabia, shaking hands and asking about the desert conditions while
being trailed by a horde of U.S. and foreign media.
   ``What's your biggest problem over here?'' Nunn asked several
members of a Marine light helicopter division and the Army's 82nd
Airborne Divisions.
   ``No mail, sir,'' was the most common answer.
   Others in the group said they were impressed with troop morale
in the harsh desert conditions.
   ``The morale here is just unbelieveable,'' Sen. John Warner,
R-Va. and the ranking Republican on Armed Services, said after an
paratrooper recounted an exercise in 140-degree heat.
   ``The people back home are with you,'' Warner said.
   In a brief tarmac interview, Warner said he was confident the
American public could support the deployment even if it dragged on.
   ``The weak link in this dilemma isn't the people back home,''
Warner said. Asked if by that he expected other nations to
eventually loosen their enforcement of sanctions against Iraq,
Warner said: ``I don't think so. I certainly hope not.''
   Other senators making the trip, all Republicans, were: Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, Steve Symms of Idaho, Alfonse D'Amato of New
York and Connie Mack of Florida.

   Tariq Aziz, Iraq's cigar-chomping foreign
minister, arguably has the toughest assignment in world diplomacy _
defending Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the holding of
thousands of Western men, women and children as hostages.
   Aziz, the only Christian in Saddam's 25-man Cabinet, heads the
Iraqi president's diplomatic offensive in the confrontation with
the United States over Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``He's a sly fox and he's utterly in Saddam's pocket,'' said
Hans-Heino Kopietz, a London-based Middle East analyst who knows
him.
   The silver-haired Aziz, who speaks English and often appears in
public in olive drab military uniform, has shown a flair for
survival. But like the rest of Saddam's inner circle, Aziz knows
that if Saddam goes down, so does he.
   The urbane Aziz, 54, has escaped the periodic purges of top
political and military officials since Saddam came to power 11
years ago.
   He survived an assassination attempt in Baghdad on April 1,
1980, when members of the Iranian-backed Ad Dawa Islami, or Islamic
Call, detonated a bomb. Several people were killed.
   The bombing was one of a series of terrorist attacks by
pro-Iranian militants in Iraq that was a factor in Saddam's
decision to invade Iran in 1980, launching the eight-year gulf war.
   ``He's one of the brighter people in the regime,'' Kopietz said.
``He's made a lot of friends in the United Nations, which gives him
some diplomatic clout. But he serves his master well and does what
he's told.''
   Aziz has been a close associate of Saddam since the 1950s, when
they were in the Baath Arab Socialist Party underground struggling
to overthrow the British-imposed monarchy.
   In those days, Saddam was a street fighter and gunman. Aziz,
with a degree in English literature from Baghdad University, worked
on party organization and propaganda.
   The Baath succeeded in seizing power in 1968.
   Saddam later became vice president and the real power behind the
head of state, President Ahmad Hassan al-Bakr.
   Aziz was one of the party's leading ideologues and editor of its
mouthpiece, the Al-Thawra daily newspaper.
   After Saddam shunted al-Bakr aside in 1979, Aziz was named
information minister and became a member of the Baath's national
command and the ruling Revolutionary Command Council headed by
Saddam.
   He is considered one of the most eloquent defenders of the
Baghdad government, always available to foreign reporters for
interviews in his book-lined office.
   Given the totalitarian and ruthless nature of Saddam's rule,
Aziz has no easy task.
   The invasion and annexation of Kuwait, and Saddam's decision to
hold several thousand Americans and Britons hostage in Baghdad to
deter Western attack, has made his job even more unenviable.
   In a government dominated by Sunni Moslems, the Christian Aziz
has no independent power base of his own.
   He was born near the northern city of Mosul into a humble family
of Nestorian Christians, an ancient sect that still speaks Aramaic,
the language spoken in the time of Jesus Christ. His given name was
Mikhail Yuhanna.
   He changed it to the Moslem-sounding name he now uses.
   Aziz was named foreign minister and deputy prime minister in
1981.
   Like other Iraqi leaders, he blamed the United States for the
gulf war, claiming Washington had covertly encouraged the
revolutionary government in Tehran to provoke Iraq so Washington
could regain control of Iran.
   Aziz argued that Iraq was not the aggressor. Iraq invaded Iran
in September 1980 but claimed the war had begun several weeks
earlier with border attacks by the Iranians.
   During the latter stages of the war, when Saddam wanted to
internationalize it so that Iran would be weakened and respond to
his peace appeals, Aziz and other leaders became less anti-American.
   In 1986, after the United States restored relations with
Baghdad, broken in 1967, the anti-American rhetoric stopped.
   But it flared again several months ago. Saddam accused the
United States and the West of a concerted campaign against Iraq to
prevent it from expanding its military power. He claimed that
Western opposition was a prelude to an Israeli pre-emptive strike.

   Jordan's King Hussein, touring North African
countries as part of efforts to defuse the Persian Gulf crisis, met
with Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the official Libyan news
agency JANA reported today.
   The JANA dispatch, monitored in Rome, said Gadhafi and the king
had a ``working session'' Sunday night in Tripoli, shortly after
Hussein's arrival.
   It did not say what the two men discussed nor did it mention the
Persian Gulf crisis, which was touched off when Iraq invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2 and then annexed it.
   A senior Jordanian official said Sunday that King Hussein also
will visit Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania.
   Hussein's visit to Libya is his first since 1984 and comes three
months after diplomatic relations were restored.
   Gadhafi long disdained Jordan's friendly relations with the
United States, and relations were cut after Libyan students burned
Jordan's embassy in Tripoli to protest King Hussein's moderate
policy toward Israel.

   Many prominent musicians have met early deaths in air accidents.
Here is a list:
   Aug. 27, 1990, Grammy-winning blues guitarist Stevie Ray
Vaughan, 35, was killed when a helicopter crashed into a hill in
East Troy, Wis., after departing from a concert. Vaughan had a
platinum album with his band Double Trouble in ``Couldn't Stand the
Weather,'' released in 1984. That year, he won a Grammy Award for
best traditional blues recording for a song called ``Flood Down in
Texas.'' This year, he won a Grammy in the contemporary blues
category for ``In Step.''
   Dec. 31, 1985, Rick Nelson died in a New Year's Eve plane crash
near De Kalb, Texas. Nelson, 45, achieved rock 'n' roll stardom in
the late 1950s and early '60s with hits like ``I'm Walkin,''' and
``Travelin' Man.'' He was featured, along with the rest of his
family, on the long-running TV series, ``The Adventures of Ozzie
and Harriet.''
   Oct. 21, 1977: Singer Ronnie Van Zant and some members of his
Lynyrd Skynyrd band, which carved a niche in the rock world with
its image as hard- drinking, hell-raising Southerners, were killed
in a plane crash in McComb, Miss.
   Sept. 20, 1973: Jim Croce died in an air crash near
Natchitoches, La., at age 30. He put together a string of rock hits
such as ``Time in a Bottle'' in the 1970s.
   Dec. 10, 1967, rhythm and blues artist Otis Redding died in a
plane crash in Wisconsin along with members of his band, the
Bar-Kays. He was 26. His greatest hit, ``Sittin' on the Dock of The
Bay,'' was released just three days before the crash.
   July 31, 1964, country music singer Jim Reeves, known for hits
like ``Welcome to My World'' and ``He'll Have to Go,'' died at age
39 in a light plane crash near Nashville along with his manager,
Dean Manuel, 30.
   March 5, 1963: Patsy Cline, whose country hits included
``Crazy'' and ``She's Got You,'' died in a plane crash near Camden,
Tenn., at age 31. Also killed were Grand Ole Opry stars Cowboy
Copas and Hawkshaw Hawkins and pilot Randy Hughes, Miss Cline's
manager. Her life was dramatized in the movie, ``Sweet Dreams,''
starring Jessica Lange as Miss Cline.
   Feb. 3, 1959: A plane carrying singers J.P (The Big Bopper)
Richardson, Buddy Holly and Richie Valens crashed near Mason City,
Iowa, en route to a show in Fargo, N.D. The Big Bopper, whose big
hit was ``Chantilly Lace'' in 1958, was 29. Holly, whose hits
included ``Peggy Sue,'' was 22. Valens, famous for songs like ``La
Bamba'' and ``Donna,'' was 18.
   Dec. 15, 1944, big band leader Glenn Miller was in a plane
flying over the English Channel en route from Bedford, England, to
Paris where he was to give a show. The plane never arrived. Two
members of the British Royal Air Force said the musician's plane
might have been hit by bombs jettisoned over the English Channel by
RAF bombers.

   A car stopped suddenly on a highway
north of Durban, setting off a chain-reaction crash that killed 11
people and left one man trapped in the wreckage for 5{ hours,
authorities said Monday.
   Rescue workers used torches and the ``jaws of life'' to free
Paddy Millerd following the crash Sunday night. ``He's lucky to be
alive,'' said Dr. John Keenan of the Natal Emergency Medical
Service.
   Millerd was one of eight people injured in the accident, which
involved more than a dozen vehicles.
   Police said one car came to a sudden stop on a highway and was
hit from behind by another. More cars plowed into the growing
wreckage. A tanker truck carrying chemicals then smashed into a
line of traffic stopped because of the accident, setting off a
large fire, police said.
   The highway was closed more than 12 hours.
   It was not known why the first car stopped.
   The independent South African Press Association reported Monday
the tanker driver was arrested on suspicion of culpable homicide,
drunk driving and reckless driving. His name was not released.

<HEAD>Students Protest Quota System to Give Lower Castes More Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of students commandeered buses
and blocked streets Monday in the latest of a series of protests
against a move to give downtrodden castes a bigger share of
government jobs.
   The unrest began three three weeks ago when Prime Minister V.P.
Singh announced a plan to set quotas to guarantee more jobs to
lower castes. On Monday, Singh said quotas would also be introduced
for lower-income groups, regardless of caste.
   Hindus, who make up at least 85 percent of India's people, have
a complex social system of castes and sub-castes dividing them into
a rigid hierarchy. High-caste Hindus hold the majority of
government jobs and are usually richer than lower castes.
   Under the latest quotas, the number of reserved government jobs
would rise to nearly 60 percent, with the rest awarded on merit.
The government employs about 18 million people in this country of
880 million people.
   The government says ``socially backward classes'' make up about
half of the population and that the quotas would help equitable
distribution of income.
   Opponents say the quota system would lead to the employment and
promotion of unqualified people and would heighten caste tensions.
   Discrimination on the basis of caste is banned by law. But in
practice, the caste system still permeates Indian society,
especially in rural areas.
   In New Delhi, students protesting Singh's proposals ordered
passengers off city buses, broke the windows, deflated tires and
left the buses blocking major intersections.
   Riot police chased students from one protest site to another.
Police said at least 50 youths were arrested. At one point,
government employees on their lunch break joined the protesting
students.
   ``What they are doing is right,'' a gray-haired government
officer told a policeman trying to disperse the students. ``Your
children and mine won't get jobs.''
   ``We are not going to take it. We want jobs,'' said Somesh, a
teen-age student who was stopping buses in Connaught Place, the
city's busiest commercial area.
   Most of the city's shops and schools were closed. Some closed to
support the agitation; others because they feared vandalism.
   While the protests were under way, Singh was in Parliament
proposing more quotas, this time for low-income groups.
   He said 5 percent to 10 percent of all government jobs would be
reserved for low-income groups but the eligibility standards would
be decided later.

<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This resort city is helping to throw
a Labor Day weekend party in hopes that last year's violence will
be forgotten and that college students will continue to come to
play on the beach and spend money.
   But some are urging a boycott of Virginia Beach.
   More than 100,000 young people jammed the city's beachfront
strip for the 1989 Labor Day weekend. Many were students from
predominantly black colleges and universities along the East Coast
who have gathered here for an informal end-of-summer party for
nearly 10 years.
   But violence and looting broke out. City and state police and
the National Guard cleared the beachfront thoroughfare. Violent
clashes between riot stick-wielding police and young blacks
degenerated into a riot.
   Hundreds of people were arrested or cited, and more than 50 were
injured. Most of those arrested were local residents, not college
students. Damage was estimated at more than $1.4 million.
   Both sides blamed the other.
   The students said city officials and merchants had been hostile
and rude, charging high prices and harassing them.
   City officials said it was simply a problem of too many people
in too small an area with too little to do along the 24-block-long
strip.
   Several groups are calling for black students to stay away this
year.
   ``We are doing this to help economically empower black Americans
and to protest the injustice done last year,'' said C. David
Walker, a student at Norfolk State University and part of group
called Concerned Black Awareness Council.
   He and others are promoting gatherings in Washington, Baltimore,
and Atlantic Beach, S.C.
   The Virginia Beach gathering started nearly a decade ago when a
group of black fraternity and sorority members gathered on the
beach. From 1985 to 1988, the party had a promoter who called it
Greekfest and worked with the city to provide entertainment.
   Problems in 1988 with scattered vandalism and rowdiness had
merchants pressuring the City Council to ``do something about
Greekfest.'' The council passed stricter alcohol and beach behavior
laws and denied Greekfest organizers the use of city buildings for
dances.
   A civic panel appointed to investigate the 1989 riots for the
City Council found that both sides went into the holiday weekend
with a defensive attitude. The group said there was enough blame to
go around and that both sides needed to work together in planning
for 1990.
   The Council then appointed another citizens group to plan the
event with the condition that no tax money be spent to entertain
the guests.
   Part of the festivities will be moved to a park several miles
from the beach. With business help, the committee booked two days
of musical entertainment at the park.
   There will be a job fair, a religious-human services conference,
parade, football game, and prayer breakfast, plus beach games and
swimsuit and dance competitions. Celebrities such as New York
Knicks star Patrick Ewing, Christine King Farris, daughter of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and NAACP Executive Director Benjamin
Hooks are expected to attended.
   There will be planned festivities at the beach, too.
   But Walker and other students still want to boycott the city.
   ``All this (the boycott) is, is to say for one four-day weekend,
where we would normally spend our money in a predominantly white
community, we're going to spend it in a black community,'' said
Mark Thompson, a Howard University junior.
   A boycott would be bad news for Linwood Branch, president of the
Virginia Beach Hotel and Motel Association.
   Branch and others said they don't know what to expect from the
weekend, and hotel reservations at the beach are down nearly 70
percent.
   ``Usually we're about full for the weekend at this point,'' said
Branch, owner of a resort and shop on the beach. ``Labor Day is
normally the biggest weekend of the season that only lasts 60 to 70
days now.''

<DATELINE>DOBRNJA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers Monday recovered the bodies
of 69 coal miners and tunneled toward about 100 others trapped by
an explosion, although there was no sign they were alive.
   Yugoslavia's federal trade union demanded that all those
responsible for the accident, from local officials to government
ministers, resign. The cause of what would be Yugoslavia's worst
mining accident has not been determined, but the investigation is
focusing on an accumulation of coal dust or methane gas.
   One miner who was working near the surface was pulled out of the
mine alive shortly after the blast early Sunday. Bosko Zelic, a
member of the Kreka mine's managing board, told reporters it was
unlikely any more survivors would be found.
   The mining minister, Radisa Gacic, said in a statement that the
tragedy should not be compounded by ``by endangering the lives of
any of the rescuers.''
   But rescue teams refused to give up hope as they reached a point
about 300 yards from an area where the shaft widens. That extra
space could have dissipated the force of the blast, said rescue
technician Rasim Kekic.
   ``If anybody happened to be in that spot during the explosion,
he may have lived through it,'' he said.
   Rescuers had been working round the clock since the explosion to
clear tons of concrete and other debris that blocked underground
shafts. They were concentrating on clearing or building new
ventilation shafts in case some of the miners still were alive.
   The inital blast left a crater 45 feet wide and about 15 feet
deep where the entrance to the mine used to be. Huge blocks of
concrete that formed the mine mouth lay strewn about the area, and
the charred remains of a coal conveyer system were being removed by
workers.
   Mining inspector Mehmed Zulic said that the number of mining
helmets and lamps that were issued indicated 170 men were
underground at the time of the blast. All but two had been
identified.
   Earlier, Zelic had said the number of those trapped underground
was 179.
   The miners at Kreka, about 90 miles west of Belgrade, returned
Saturday from a weeklong strike that ended with a promised 100
percent raise in pay that averaged $270 a month. Speculation about
the explosion focused on the possibility that volatile coal dust
and methane gas built up in the mine, one of the nation's oldest,
during the strike.
   Yugoslavia's previous worst mining disaster occurred when 128
miners died in 1965. Ninety men were killed in a methane explosion
at a coal mine last November.

   Iraq allowed 52 American detainees to cross into Turkey today
and the U.N. secretary-general announced he would meet a top Iraqi
diplomat to seek a peaceful resolution of the Middle East crisis.
   In Washington, the State Department ordered a two-thirds
reduction in the Iraqi Embassy staff in retaliation for Baghdad's
crackdown on embassies in Kuwait.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said 36 Iraqi
diplomats were being expelled, reducing the embassy's staff from 55
to 19. Those expelled include seven diplomats and 29 members of the
non-diplomatic staff. The remaining Iraqi diplomats are being
restricted to a 25-mile radius of Washington, she said.
   The 52 Americans, dependents of diplomats from the U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait who the Iraqis have refused to release, crossed into
Turkey at the Habur border post early today and later flew to a
NATO base at Incirlik, 320 miles to the west.
   Three members of the group, sons of diplomats, were turned back
at the border by Iraqi officials, the State Department said in
Washington. The three, all over age 18, were sent back to Baghdad
under escort.
   The group's other members were to leave Turkey for the United
States on Tuesday, said Sgt. Marty Davis, spokeswoman at Incirlik.
   In the Persian Gulf, U.S. warships shadowed Iraqi vessels but
did not invoke a resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council on
Saturday that sanctions the use of military might to enforce a
U.N.-ordered trade embargo.
   CBS News reported that Iraqi captains have received new orders
not to defy the embargo but to allow U.S. warships to stop and
search their vessels. CBS did not cite a source for the report by
its Pentagon correspondent.
   The multinational force got a boost today when the small gulf
state of Qatar agreed to allow use of its military facilities by
the forces confronting Iraq. Qatar has traditionally cooperated
militarily with Britain and France.
   In Paris, the military chiefs of nine Western European nations
gathered to work out plans to enforce the United Nations embargo.
   The United Nations said Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar will meet Thursday in Jordan with Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz ``to engage in a full exchange of views on the crisis.''
   It would be the first formal U.N. attempt to mediate the crisis,
which Iraqi President Saddam Hussein precipitated by invading
Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexing the oil-rich emirate.
   In Washington, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said
Sunday that the Bush administration ``would have no problem'' with
a mediation effort by Perez de Cuellar.
   For a third day, skeleton staffs at embassies in Kuwait City
defied an Iraqi order to close their missions. Iraqi troops
surrounded the U.S. and other compounds and cut utilities but did
not use force against the diplomats.
   The U.S., British, French, Hungarian and Danish embassies were
among those surrounded Sunday. Varying services such as water,
power and communications were cut to the U.S., West German, French,
Canadian, Japanese, Danish missions.
   Iraq last week ordered embassies in Kuwait closed, but most
nations said they did not recognize Iraq's takeover of its neighbor
and refused to heed the order. There have been no reports of Iraqis
moving on the embassy holdouts.
   However, Lebanese officials in Beirut said today that Lebanon's
ambassador to Kuwait and his nine-member staff were missing after
leaving their mission. Salah Staitieh, director-general of the
Lebanese Foreign Ministry, said group was due in Beirut two days
ago.
   Local radio stations in Lebanon said the embassy group was
seized by Iraqi troops as it set out for the Saudi border and was
taken to Baghdad.
   The United States sent about 100 diplomats and dependents from
Kuwait to Baghdad last week for transit home but the Iraqis reneged
on a promise to let them out, saying male embassy workers would be
held until the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait was closed.
   Early today, 52 wives and children of the captive U.S. diplomats
were permitted to cross into Turkey. The 429-mile journey from
Baghdad to Diyarbakir in southern Turkey took 27 hours, a U.S.
Embassy spokesman said condition of anonymity.
   ``The trip was very tiring, very long and very distressing. Now
they are washing up and resting,'' he said before they flew to the
Incirlik base.
   An official at the base, speaking on condition of anonymity,
later confirmed the group's arrival and declined to let any of the
arrivals talk with an AP reporter by phone.
   In all, about 21,000 Westerners are stranded in Iraq and Kuwait,
including 3,000 Americans. Iraq says some have been distributed
among Iraqi strategic sites for use as human shields to deter a
U.S. attack.
   The United States, Britain and France all reported Sunday that
more of their citizens in Kuwait had been rounded up.
   The State Department said in Washington Sunday that Iraqi troops
detained two more Americans, who were being held at a Kuwaiti
hotel. Dozens have been rounded up in the past weeks.
   Britain's Foreign Office said today that more British nationals
were rounded up Sunday in Kuwait, bringing the total held to 157.
In France, the Foreign Ministry said Iraqi troops took eight more
French from their homes in Kuwait to a hotel. In all, 60 French
nationals are detained.
   Pope John Paul II, in his first public condemnation of Iraqi
actions, criticized human rights violations and prayed for the
foreign hostages.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait prompted several nations to send
warships to the region, and the United States has moved dozens of
warplanes and about 60,000 troops in Saudi Arabia to prevent
further Iraqi aggression.
   It is the biggest American deployment since the Vietnam war.
   On Sunday, the Army ordered 50 more reserve and National Guard
units in 25 states to report for active duty by Aug. 31. Air
National Guard Reserve units from six states were called up on
Friday.
   In Paris today, the top military leaders of the nine-member
Western European Union opened a one-day meeting behind closed
doors. A military source said before the meeting opened that the
chief topic would be dividing the tasks of European naval forces
and coordinating them with the huge U.S. fleet in the region.
   But attention also turned to diplomacy.
   A day after the U.N. Security Council authorized the use of
military force to back the trade embargo it ordered against Iraq on
Aug. 6, Perez de Cuellar offered to meet with Iraq's top diplomat.
   In Baghdad, Aziz said he planned to meet with the U.N. chief but
declined to say whether Iraq was prepared to compromise on Kuwait's
status. He did say, however, that his country would listen to any
proposal.
   Scowcroft said the United States will not back down from its
insistence that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait, but beyond that ``We're
prepared to talk about anything.''
   Also in Baghdad, Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser
Arafat proposed today that an Arab peacekeeping force be deployed
in Kuwait for six months to replace Iraqi troops while elections
are held.
   The Bush administration has insisted that the deposed al-Sabah
family be restored as Kuwait's rulers.

   Tens of thousands of blacks went on
strike Monday to demand an end to factional fighting that has
killed more than 500 people. Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu
angrily blamed police and pro-apartheid whites for the violence.
   Tutu called for creation of a new police force acceptable to
blacks as he addressed about 6,000 people gathered at a funeral for
seven ANC supporters killed in the battles.
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that the police have not been
impartial,'' he told the cheering listeners.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok later rejected charges that
police took sides in the conflict. He said in a statement that
individual officers may have acted improperly but that the force as
a whole tried to maintain order.
   The strike left the streets of Soweto, a sprawling black
township of 2.5 million people, nearly deserted. Many businesses in
Soweto and neighboring Johannesburg were forced to close or operate
with skeleton staffs. Most trains and buses were almost empty or
did not run.
   The strike was called by the anti-apartheid Soweto Civic
Association to ``protest the violence, police behavior and to mourn
our dead.'' Residents in several neighboring townships also took
part.
   Heavily armed South African troops and police in armored
vehicles patrolled the townships. Police commanders reported no new
violence in the Johannesburg area.
   Savage fighting erupted in the townships around Johannesburg on
Aug. 12, pitting Xhosas and other blacks loyal to the African
National Congress against Zulus tied to the conservative Inkatha
movement. Police said at least 515 people were killed.
   Police said Monday at least 10 blacks were killed during the
weekend in the eastern province of Natal, which has been the scene
of factional fighting since 1986. More than 5,000 people have died
there.
   Tutu, a top anti-apartheid leader, passionately denounced the
government and police for the violence. He charged the unrest was
fomented to frustrate blacks' struggle to be free in South Africa,
where the black majority has no voice in national affairs.
   ``Our freedom is at hand,'' Tutu said to tumultuous cheers.
``And there are those (whites) who say they don't want us to have
our freedom ... so they have made us fight one another.''
   Zulus and Xhosas are the two largest tribes in South Africa, but
Tutu denied the fighting was caused by tribal divisions. ``We have
never quarreled because of tribalism. It is a lie! It is a lie!''
he shouted in anger.
   Other black leaders also attacked the government, charging that
apartheid created the ethnic tensions that triggered the fighting.
They called for abolition of the hostels where Zulu migrant workers
live. Those hostels have often come under attack.
   ``It is a violence that has been organized by evil forces _
white and black,'' said senior ANC leader Walter Sisulu.
   At the funeral, ANC honor guards in khaki uniforms stood around
the coffins giving clenched fist salutes. The stadium was filled
with chanting and singing blacks, many wearing the black, green and
gold colors of the ANC.
   ``I am proud I am black,'' the crowd chanted in unison with Tutu.
   Government and police leaders deny the charges of bias and
insist security forces have been impartial. Elite army battalions
were sent into the townships during the weekend to help police.
   The government and many neutral observers portray the conflict
as mostly tribal fighting linked to the power struggle between the
ANC and Inkatha.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has blamed the ANC for
instigating the fighting, accusing it of wanting to crush all
opposition.
   President F.W. de Klerk is negotiating with the ANC and other
groups to end apartheid and share political power with the black
majority.
   Both Inkatha and the ANC oppose apartheid, South Africa's system
of racial segregation, but differ on methods for fighting it.

   A United Airlines jumbo jet with 342 people
aboard skidded to a safe emergency landing today at Los Angeles
International Airport after its nose landing gear would not extend,
authorities said.
   The 323 passengers and 19 crew members used emergency chutes to
evacuate the Boeing 747, which was coming in from Sydney,
Australia, said Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for Chicago-based United
Airlines.
   ``There were no serious injuries reported in the evacuation,''
said Molinaro. He said he was not sure if there were any minor
injuries, but he said he knew no one was hospitalized.
   Fred O'Donnell, spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the aircraft was on approach when the crew
notified the tower it was unable to get the front landing gear down.
   The 10:25 a.m. emergency forced authorities to close down two of
the airport's four runways.
   ``We had to close Runway 25 Left and 25 Right,'' said O'Donnell.
``It can be handled. We just move traffic to the remaining runways.
It's not causing a problem.''
   It was the second United airliner in a week to land at the
airport with a failed landing gear.
   On Tuesday, a United Boeing 737 jetliner with a retracted right
main gear skidded to a safe landing, coming down on the nose gear,
the left main gear and the engine under the right wing. It had been
diverted to the Los Angeles airport from nearby Burbank Airport.
   The 107 people aboard the plane slid down emergency chutes.
There were no injuries.
   A flashlight left by a mechanic in the wheel well was
responsible for the gear failure, said investigators.

   An armed robbery suspect who forced a television
station to interrupt broadcasting by hiding in its building was
arrested Monday on the seventh floor.
   Police found the man in a closet of the building that houses
WLS-TV about 29 hours after he entered, said Detective Stephen
Stratton.
   The man had a semiautomatic weapon and about $6,000 in cash
believed to have been taken Saturday from a restaurant, Stratton
said.
   WLS went off the air for 25 minutes Saturday night and evacuated
about 50 employees after the gunman was seen in a stairwell.
   Police searched the building but did not find the gunman, who
did not harm anyone or attempt to take hostages.
   Station personnel rigged a studio at their transmitter and
broadcast a special report about the gunman. But they had to
suspend regular programming. The station resumed regular
programming Sunday at 7 a.m.
   Police surrounded the building again Sunday night after a
witness reported hearing glass break and spotting a man in a
10th-floor window. He was arrested early Monday.

<HEAD>Personal Income, Consumer Spending Both Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Personal incomes grew 0.6 percent in July and
consumer spending rose 0.5 percent, the government said Monday in a
report that some analysts contend points to a stronger economy than
expected.
   Stephen S. Roach, senior economist for Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
New York, said the growth in both areas was important since it
could tend to lessen the effect of the Middle East crisis on the
economy.
   ``It holds out the hope that we might be able to scrape by
without going into recession,'' he said.
   In another upbeat report, the National Association of Realtors
said existing home sales rose for a second straight month in July.
House resales rose 3.3 percent following a 0.9 percent gain in June.
   The increase reflected decreasing mortgage rates at the end of
July, but the trend has reversed since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and analysts predict a slowdown in sales.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending, which represents
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, totaled $3.67
trillion. That was up $16.6 billion from the previous month
although the pace was slower than June's 1 percent increase.
   A Commerce spokesman said the slower pace resulted from fewer
purchases of automobiles, food and clothing.
   Nevertheless, William K. MacReynolds, forecasting director for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, called the consumption expenditures
for June and July a ``bright spot.''
   ``If the July consumption level can be maintained for the next
two months, consumption in the third quarter will increase at an
annual rate of 2.3 percent over the second quarter,'' he said.
``This would be the highest quarterly increase since the third
quarter of 1989.''
   But MacReynolds and others said the inflationary effects of
rising oil prices likely will reduce spending.
   So far, however, there have been no ``horror stories,''
according to economist Sandra Shaber of the Futures Group, a
Washington management consulting firm.
   ``People haven't been canceling auto purchases,'' she said.
``Retailers are complaining about soft business, but there's no
sign of further deterioration because of the Middle East crisis.''
   The Commerce Department also reported that personal incomes
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.67 trillion, a
$26.3 billion increase from June. It was the largest increase since
a 0.7 percent gain in March.
   The report said Americans' income after taxes increased 0.5
percent, down slightly from 0.6 percent a month earlier.
   ``The gains were primarily from wages and salaries, rather than
dividends and interest payments and things like that,'' Ms. Shaber
said. ``It suggests some strength in the economy, and that's money
that people spend.''
   Wages and salaries rose $16.2 billion after a $15.9 billion
increase in June.
   Americans' savings rate _ savings as a percent of disposable
income _ was unchanged from June's 4.9 percent.
   A higher savings rate means less dependence on foreign capital
since funds thus would be available domestically for business
investment. Americans' savings rate for all of 1989 was 4.6 percent.
   On the spending side, the increase in personal consumption,
which includes everything except interest payments on debt, rose
$16.6 billion, down from June's gain of $36.1 billion.
   Spending on durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ increased $5.3 billion. It was the second
consecutive increase after five months of declines.
   Non-durable spending, however, slipped $1.7 billion following a
$13.5 billion gain in June. Spending on services was up $13.0
billion.

   The 50 women competing to be Miss
America 1991 arrived Monday, using a train for the first time since
1939.
   ``Since it was my first train ride, I was quite excited,'' Miss
Indiana, Brenda Alyce Bassett, said as the pageant began its
two-week 70th anniversary celebration.
   The contestants' arrival differed from years past when
competitors came by plane and car at staggered times.
   Pageant director Leonard Horn said the pageant returned to train
travel to commemorate the anniversary of the program, which began
in 1921 as a public relations gimmick by seaside merchants to eke
out an added weekend of tourists after Labor Day.
   In another reference to the past, the contestants spent the
weekend making public appearances in Philadelphia. Between 1935 and
1939, the contestants first stopped in Philadelphia before they
came to Atlantic City.
   The pageant has gradually placed greater emphasis on brains over
beauty, but Monday's arrival _ like most first days _ shifted the
focus to contestants' looks and what they were wearing.
   This week will be spent rehearsing for next week's show as well
as practicing individual talents. The finals will be nationally
televised Sept. 8.
   The winner will succeed Miss America 1990, Debbye Turner, and
win a $35,000 scholarship.

   Hundreds of baseball fans stormed onto
a field to protest their team's defeat and hurled broken bottles,
trash cans, rocks and burning chairs in a rampage that left nine
people hospitalized, police said Monday.
   President Roh Tae-woo ordered an investigation into the
incident, which occurred Sunday night. The prosecutor general's
office said six men were being held by police for questioning.
   One of the injured was hit in the abdomen by shards of glass and
was hospitalized in serious condition, police said. Seven other
spectators and one riot policeman were also hospitalized.
   The rampage began three hours into a game between two
professional teams, the Haitai Tigers and the Lucky Group Twins.
The Twins were ahead 10-0 in the bottom of the seventh when the
trouble started.
   About 400 Tiger fans jumped over barricades surrounding the
playing field and stampeded into the pitching area, witnesses said.
Another 20,000 spectators shouted and booed from their seats.
   Protesters hurled hundreds of broken bottles, metal trash cans,
rocks and chairs which were set afire, witnesses and police said.
The rampage lasted 50 minutes until police intervened.
   It was not clear what ignited the protest, but witnesses said
supporters for the losing team felt they were being cheated.
   The Twins went on to win the game 13-1.
   The two teams are placed third and fourth in South Korea's
single professional baseball league. Competition between them is
intense.

<DATELINE>BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan's remark
that Yellowstone National Park was ``devastated'' by fire two years
ago is being criticized as too harsh.
   Critics also are upset that Lujan said an apocalyptic group that
owns land north of the park poses no threat to Yellowstone. Park
officials have warned some activities of the Church Universal and
Triumphant could harm the park's geothermal resources and its
wildlife.
   During a visit to the park in Wyoming last week, Lujan said it
was his impression that the 1988 fires in and near the park
``devastated'' Yellowstone. That was in sharp contrast to efforts
by state and federal agencies to play down the extent of the damage.
   Lujan's comments ``reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of two
of the most serious issues facing the land and the people of Park
and Gallatin counties,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said in a letter
to Lujan.
   Baucus said Lujan's statements ``were out of line with public
statements and professional judgments of your own Park Service land
managers.''
   Jeanne Marie Souvigney of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition
agreed.
   ``He must not understand the issues to make statements like
that,'' she said. ``There has been a big educational effort that
the park was changed by the fires, not devastated.''
   Lujan last week met privately with Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the
church's spiritual leader, in an effort to hear the church's side
of the conflicts with the park and to try to bring the two sides
closer to conciliation.
   He said the conflicts are ``not insurmountable'' and that he
believed the park and the church can be good neighbors.
   The church was criticized last spring when an estimated 31,000
gallons of diesel and gasoline leaked from three tanks at its
underground shelter complex. The shelters are intended to protect
followers during what Prophet says is a 12-year ``dark cycle'' of
global danger and catastrophe.
   Steve Goldstein, a spokesman for Lujan, said Lujan's intention
in meeting with Prophet was to try to bring the park and church
closer together.
   Park officials have testified in public hearings and before
Congress that some activities of the church threaten the greater
Yellowstone ecosystem. The concerns include development affecting
wildlife migration patterns and the church's drilling of a well in
a geothermal aquifer.
   Church officials have said they are considerate of wildlife
migration in the fencing of their property. They also have promised
not to develop the geothermal well if it would pose any risk to
Yellowstone's geysers.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday urged
Arab countries to unite against Iraqi aggression as he met with the
Egyptian foreign minister, the Tass news agency said.
   Gorbachev emphasized to Esmat Abdel-Meguid ``the necessity of
bringing the Arab factor to bear more strongly'' on Iraq, the
official news agency said.
   ``The circumstances are such that Arabs should show their
ability to unify quickly and to make joint decisions in their own
interests and in the interests of the whole world,'' Tass
paraphrased Gorbachev as telling the Egyptian official.
   ``This would be highly appreciated by the international
community,'' he reportedly added.
   At an Aug. 10 summit in Cairo, 12 of the 21 nations in the Arab
League voted to condemn Iraq for seizing Kuwait and agreed to send
Arab soldiers to help defend Saudi Arabia against a possible Iraqi
offensive. Only Egypt, Morocco and Syria have contributed troops.
   Meanwhile, the evacuation of the families of Soviet oil workers
and other technical specialists from Baghdad was being planned. A
total of 983 Soviet dependents have been living in Iraq, and all of
them are slated to depart on special Aeroflot flights by Sept. 1,
Tass said.
   Gorbachev has called Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion and subsequent
annexation of Kuwait an act of ``treachery'' and a ``blatant
violation of international law.''
   The Soviet Union voted Saturday for a U.N. Security Council
resolution allowing the use of force to impose an international
economic embargo on Iraq, a longtime Soviet ally. But Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said Sunday that the Soviet navy,
which has two warships in the Persian Gulf region, would not itself
use force.
   Shevardnadze denied that the Soviet Union was restraining itself
for the sake of its 7,791 citizens _ including 193 military
advisers _ still in Iraq.
   ``There is no direct connection between the fact that we are not
counting on the use of force, and the evacuation of our citizens
from Iraq,'' he said.
   Shevardnadze reiterated the Soviet position that the gulf crisis
should be resolved peacefully and politically, rather than
militarily.
   ``Another way (other than a political solution) would mean a
catastrophe,'' be told reporters.
   Despite the unwillingness to use force against its old ally,
Soviet officials have maintained that Moscow is in complete
solidarity with Western governments against Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   ``The resolutions of the Security Council will be strictly
enforced,'' Tass said in summarizing Gorbachev's remarks to
Abdel-Meguid. ``And Iraq must draw the correct conclusions from the
solidarity shown by the international community in these
resolutions, and must not try to aggravate the situation, but
rather seek from its side a way out of the impasse.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were mixed in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.2 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.49 percent, down from 7.55 percent
last week. Another $9.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.48 percent, up from 7.45 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest for three-month bills since they sold
for 7.41 percent on Aug. 13. It was the highest for six-month bills
since they averaged 7.52 percent on July 16.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.74 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,810.70 and 7.88 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,621.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.93
percent last week, up from 7.73 percent the previous week.

   Arleen Nelson was elated to hear Monday
that her daughter and two grandchildren were among 52 Americans
safely across the Iraq border. But she's not letting her guard down
yet.
   ``We won't be really at rest until they are back in the United
States,'' Mrs. Nelson said. ``It's been a really tense time.''
   Rande Vellekoop and her two daughters _ Brigitte, 3, and Joanna,
10 months _ had been trapped in the Persian Gulf region since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We are waiting to hear from the State Department on where she
will be coming in and when,'' Mrs. Nelson said in a telephone
interview.
   Mrs. Nelson said she and her husband, Bud, hadn't spoken with
their daughter since her release. Mrs. Vellekoop did, however,
manage to reach one of her sisters by telephone. ``I don't know if
she'll call anymore,'' she said.
   In all, about 21,000 Westerners are stranded in Iraq and Kuwait,
including 3,000 Americans. Iraq says some hostages have been
distributed among Iraqi strategic sites for use as human shields to
deter a U.S. attack.
   The freed Americans, dependents of diplomats from the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait, crossed into Turkey at the Habur border post
early Monday. They later flew to a NATO base at Incirlik, 320 miles
to the west.
   The group was expected to leave Turkey for the United States on
Tuesday, said Sgt. Marty Davis, a spokeswoman at Incirlik.
   Mrs. Vellekoop's husband, Laurens Vellekoop, 33, was among State
Department employees, and three young embassy dependents over the
age of 18, whom Iraqi authorities refused to release.
   Mrs. Nelson said she received a call from her son-in-law Sunday.
``Oh my gosh, I was so surprised,'' she said. ``All I could think
of was, `Praise the Lord' and how thankful I was to ... hear his
voice.''

<TEXT>
   A wind-driven brush fire that mushroomed
from 120 acres to 2,500 in an afternoon killed two firefighters and
destroyed 18 summer homes, authorities said.
   The firefighters, whose names were not immediately released,
were apparently overcome by smoke early today, a spokesman said.
   ``The wind must have changed and got them disoriented with the
smoke and trapped them in there,'' said Bevan Killpack, Uinta
National Forest fire information officer. ``That happens if you
don't have people watching the behavior of the fire.''
   About 200 firefighters battled the blaze overnight, and fire
bosses issued a call for 160 more, officials said. Dozens of
residents were evacuated from the path of the flames, which were
sent racing by canyon wind gusting to 40 mph.
   Dick Buehler, deputy incident commander, told more than 100
residents at a noon meeting that only 18 homes and cabins in the
Swiss Alpine subdivision had been confirmed destroyed, a figure
revised sharply downward from the 50 homes fire officials had
believed were burned.
   Top priority was given to saving 300 homes in the Devil's Hole,
Lime Canyon and Snake Creek areas. The homes destroyed were in
Devil's Hole, said Uinta forest spokeswoman Loyal Clark. The fire
was partly in the forest.
   ``It's a summer-home area where the fire's concentrated, and
most of the people in there have left and gone back to their homes.
Most of those people had residences in Salt Lake (City) and other
areas,'' sheriff's Deputy Jeff Winterton said.
   The number of those who fled was not immediately known.
   Smoke from the blaze a half-mile south of Midway drifted over
Salt Lake City, about 30 miles to the northeast.
   Joan Smith, a Salt Lake real estate broker visiting the area,
said the smoke in the afternoon was so heavy it looked like dusk.
   ``The sun was blood red it was so thick,'' she said.
   When word came that flames were fast approaching the Dahl home,
family members grabbed photo albums, important documents and their
two dogs.
   ``We just freaked out,'' Millie Dahl said. ``The house is
totally gone. We didn't get our clothes, our truck, another car,
our snowmobile and the Snowcat out of there in time.''
   Mrs. Dahl, 39, her husband, Will, 48, and the couple's three
teen-age children spent the night with friends. Their house in the
Swiss Alpine neighborhood was one of the few permanently inhabited
homes to go, she said.
   ``I wish we could have had 10 more minutes, but the smoke was
billowing,'' she said. ``It was obvious that there was a problem.
Fortunately, nobody cried, no one got hysterical and no one fell
apart.''
   The fire had simmered since Thursday or Friday until the wind
Sunday pushed the flames up a mountainside into pine forests and
dry oak brush.
   Gusts carried embers into adjacent canyons, making it difficult
for firefighters to predict its spread, Clark said.
   Fire bosses ordered more crews ``from wherever they can get
them,'' said Dave Smith of the Interagency Fire Center in Salt Lake
City.
   A call was also put out for more air tankers and helicopters.
Firefighters late Sunday had one of each, officials said.
   ``We need the air tankers really bad because of the threat to
those structures,'' Clark said. ``This looks like our big one of
the year.''

<TEXT>
   The Libyan government ``provided direct
support in all phases of preparation'' for an unsuccessful May 30
terrorist attack on jammed beach resorts near Tel Aviv, Israel, the
State Department said Monday.
   In a paper it said was based on information from U.S. sources,
the department said the six assault boats used in the raid were
launched from the merchant ship Tiny Star, known earlier as the
Inger M.
   It said Libya provided personnel who accompanied the ship as it
sailed from a Libyan naval base to Ras el-Hilal, on Libya's
Mediterranean coast. There it picked up at least 16 terrorists of
the Palestine Liberation Front.
   The department said the Tiny Star then left Libya for the
drop-off point west of Israel.
   ``After launching the assault boats, the Tiny Star probably
traveled west-southwest to blend in with the hundreds of merchant
ships en route to and from the Suez canal,'' the paper said.
   The ship was docked at the Libyan port of Tobruk in mid-June and
was in the harbor of Tripoli, the Libyan capital, later that month,
the paper said. In late July, it said, the ship sailed from Tripoli
to Piraeus, Greece.
   The department said the Tiny Star was purchased in April by Star
Navigation Company of Piraeus and sailed from Cyprus for Tripoli on
April 10.
   ``Libya provided direct support in all phases of preparation for
the PLF attack against Israel, from assistance in planning the
attack to providing personnel who accompanied the ship from which
it was launched,'' the department said.
   It said the PLF began preparing for the seaborne attack at least
as early as October 1988.
   ``From late 1988 until the operation was launched, training and
preparations took place in Libya at several locations, including a
Libyan naval base,'' the paper said.
   In a statement accompanying the paper, the department said,
``The U.S. will retain its sanctions against Libya; we expect other
governments will continue their sanctions until Libya demonstrates
concrete, durable changes in its support for terrorism and
cessation of other objectionable behavior.''
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said ``Libya's
involvement in this terrorist operation provides one of the
clearest examples ever established of state sponsorship of
terrorism, and once again highlights the threat Libya poses to its
neighbors and to peace in the region.''
   Four Palestinian guerrillas were killed and 12 captured by
Israeli forces in the May 30 attack. No Israelis were injured
although tens of thousands were at beaches and resort hotels near
Tel Aviv to mark Shavuot, the Jewish holiday that honors the giving
of the Ten Commandments.

<HEAD>Bhutto Calls Weapons Charge Against Husband Political Blackmail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ZAHID HUSSAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
said Monday that charges of illegal weapons possession brought
against her husband were politically motivated.
   ``This is blackmail,'' she said. ``They are just trying to
pressure the PPP (Pakistan People's Party) and intimidate me and
humiliate him.''
   Police filed the charges Sunday night against Asif Ali Zardari
but did not arrest the 37-year-old businessman.
   Ms. Bhutto said the charges were designed to influence elections
scheduled for Oct. 24. She already had expressed doubts that the
balloting would be free and impartial. Many Pakistanis have
questioned whether there even will be elections in October.
   Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government was dismissed Aug. 6 on
charges of corruption, abuse of power and its inability to curb
relentless ethnic and political violence. Although she was removed
under constitutional provisions, Ms. Bhutto called it a virtual
coup.
   The new military-backed government is setting up tribunals to
investigate corruption. Zardari, who critics contend profited while
Ms. Bhutto was in power, is expected to be the main target.
   Qazi Abid, a member of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party,
also was charged with weapons possession. However, the charges may
be dismissed because he is a minister in the new caretaker
government.
   The state-run television on Sunday said all arms licences were
being revoked, presumably an attempt to curb repeated shooting
sprees in the southern province of Sindh. The broadcast said former
and current members of Pakistan's National Assembly and Senate
would be allowed to keep their weapons licenses.
   The charges stem from a raid Saturday of an unregistered jeep
that belonged to Abid. Police said a large cache of weapons was
seized and Zardari's driver and bodyguard were arrested. Police
said some of the weapons were licensed to Abid and some to Zardari.
In Islamabad, Abid denied the charges.

<TEXT>
   When Americans have time to pause in their
hurry-up deployment in Saudi Arabia, they find themselves admiring
the kingdom's roads and ports, which in some cases surpass those in
the United States.
   Flying over, Sgt. Kenneth Woods of Avon Park, Fla. imagined
nights in the pitch black desert eating field rations and trying to
cope with the heat.
   Instead, Woods, a member of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division,
is staying in a dormlike room in an air-conditioned trailer that
has its own bathroom and shower.
   Trailer complexes built throughout Saudi Arabia to house
construction and oil industry workers are serving as temporary
homes to American soldiers.
   The burgers and fries the Saudis bring for dinner at the camp
are sometimes cold by the time they get there, ``but who's in a
position to complain,'' said Woods.
   ``The Saudi government has been remarkably responsive,'' said
Army Maj. Gen. Gus Pagonis, who heads the Pentagon's logistics
planning in Saudi Arabia.
   Because of its oil wealth, Saudi Arabia has over the past 20
years pushed an aggressive, multibillion-dollar infrastructure
program, often using American companies and consultants.
   ``We have the money and we want our people to have the best
possible conditions,'' a Saudi official said. ``You cannot be a
modern society without these things.''
   At times, American military commanders stand in awe as they lead
reporters through Saudi military installations.
   ``This is magnificent,'' Air Force Col. John McBroom said during
a tour of F-15 hangers at a Saudi air base where his First Tactical
Fighter Wing has set up camp. ``These are the best, most modern
facilities I've ever seen.''
   Navy officials are similarly pleased with Saudi docks.
   ``We are getting tremendous use of the facilities here,'' Adm.
Steve Clarey told reporters last week as Marine tanks, trucks,
bulldozers and other equipment were offloaded from U.S. cargo
ships. ``This is probably one of the most modern ports in the
world.''
   So oversized are most Saudi military installations that American
forces have been able to move in without dislodging the Saudis from
hangers or barracks.
   The Army's 101st Airborne's air assault brigade is using a Saudi
airstrip for its helicopters.
   ``This saves a lot of wear and tear that would be caused if we
had to land over and over again in the sand,'' said Col. Tom
Garrett, the brigade's commander.
   When the huge transport planes carrying American troops and
equipment land and unload at Saudi airfields, their cargo is
shipped into field positions along a highway system that might make
U.S. urban planners jealous.
   Wide, smooth highways stretch to and from all major cities, and
into some desolate desert. It is common to pass construction crews
working on new secondary roads around the clock.
   ``You expect to be getting stuck in the sand all the time, but
instead you're worrying about the speed limit,'' an Army truck
driver said last week.

   An outbreak of cholera has killed about 30
people in and around the city of Meknes, the opposition L'Opinion
newspaper reported Monday.
   The epidemic has also spread from Meknes, 90 miles north of
Rabat, to the cities of Fez in central Morocco and Taza in the
northeast, the newspaper said.
   L'Opinion estimated more than 200 people in Meknes alone have
been treated for cholera. Official Health Ministry figures released
Saturday put the figure at 24.
   The newspaper did not say how the outbreak began, but said the
number of cholera cases in Meknes rose in mid-August.

<HEAD>Single Father Prepares for Possible Active Military Duty</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT technical to technician</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For single parents in the military
reserves, the possibility of being called to active duty has an
added worry: who will take care of the children?
   Air Force reservist Phillip Meyer of Savannah is preparing for
that contingency now.
   Meyer, a surgical technician with the 13th Contingent Hospital
in Warner Robins, received a call from his unit Friday telling him
to prepare to be activated for at least 30 days and asked if he
preferred stateside or foreign duty. He prefers to stay in the
United States.
   After the call, Meyer phoned his mother, Edith Meyer, who also
lives in Savannah, to ask her to take care of his three children _
4-year-old Christopher, 3-year-old Christin and 2-year-old Morgan.
   Then he began wondering what the kids would think if and when he
goes.
   Christopher, the oldest boy, has an idea of what is going on,
Meyer said, but the two girls are just too young to comprehend that
their father may have to leave them for a long time.
   ``They know that I'm in the Air Force, pretty much so that every
time an airplane flies overhead they say, `there's daddy,''' said
Meyer as he rocked Morgan in his living room. ``They're used to me
leaving once a month (for drills), but I don't know how they will
handle it if I'm activated.''
   However, even with three small children, Meyer said he is just
like the other reservists trying to get ready, noting that his
commanding officer in Warner Robins is in a similar situation _ a
single parent with two children.
   Despite uncertainty about which reserve units ultimately will be
activated, Meyer said he wasn't surprised that President Bush
agreed with Pentagon advice to call up the reserves.
   And he said his medical expertise means he may be deployed to
Saudi Arabia.
   ``There's the possibility that I will be over there, because we
are a surgical trauma unit. That's what we do.''

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Dutch national airline KLM
said Monday it has detoured some of its flights around the Persian
Gulf so that crews will no longer stay overnight in the region.
   KLM flights to the Far East, which previously made stopovers at
airports in the gulf, will instead fly via airports in Greece,
India, and Thailand, said airline spokesman Peter Wellhuner.
   The gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, and Oman, will only be serviced by round-trip flights
that do not require new crews to take over in transit.
   ``We don't want to have our crews positioned overnight in that
area'' because of safety concerns, said Wellhuner.
   The Dutch government has advised businesses to withdraw all
non-essential personnel from the gulf and has warned tourists to
avoid the region.
   KLM flies 42 times a week to the Middle East from the Dutch
capital. The airline's daily services to Baghdad and Kuwait were
discontinued immediately after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Environmentalists: Politics Is Key To Bush's Owl Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politics is driving a new Bush administration
report that will recommend ways to ease the economic toll of
protecting the northern spotted owl, environmentalists charged
Monday.
   The government's Interagency Task Force on the Spotted Owl is to
recommend by Saturday how the Forest Service should alter its
timber harvests to protect the threatened owl across millions of
acres in the Pacific Northwest.
   The panel's goal, as outlined by Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, is to keep the species alive by enforcing the Endangered
Species Act without devastating the region's timber industry.
   ``They are trying to find a political solution to a scientific
problem,'' said Mike Francis, director of The Wilderness Society's
national forest program.
   ``If they are going to maintain the integrity of the Endangered
Species Act, there is very little wiggle room for the
administration,'' he said Monday.
   Frances Hunt of the National Wildlife Federation agreed
``there's very little scientific'' about the task force's mission.
   ``This is politics and very shortsighted politics. It's ignoring
the real issues. It's only going to make a realistic solution
harder to find,'' she said.
   Officials for the Forest Service, Agriculture Department and
Interior Department have declined comment on the task force's work
over the past week. Agriculture Department spokeswoman Jane Stevens
said members of the task force have been directed not to talk to
the media.
   Environmentalists maintain that dramatic reductions in logging
of the region's old-growth forests is the only legally and
scientifically defensible way to take the rare owl off the road to
extinction.
   The government earlier predicted that one owl protection plan
offered by Forest Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas and a panel of
government scientists would cut regional harvests in half and cost
more than 20,000 jobs.
   But Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said on Sunday that the
task force recommendation likely will not impact as much land or as
many jobs as has been feared.

<HEAD>1,400 Sunbeam Mixers Recalled Because of Electric Shock Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sunbeam Appliance Co. of Milwaukee is
recalling 1,400 mixers found to have a risk of severe electric
shock, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday.
   The commission said the counter-top mixers can cause severe
shock if motors and other electrical components shift through
shipping or handling and come in contact with the chrome-plated
housing.
   There have been no reports of consumers being injured, it said.
   Sunbeam spokesman Wayne Smith said the defect was discovered
through rough handling tests at the factory and voluntarily
reported to the government.
   The affected models were distributed from February through April
this year and have the model numbers 01930 and 01940. The two
models had suggested retail prices of $165 to $185.
   People with those models were advised to stop using them
immediately and contact Sunbeam.
   Smith said several thousand units had already been recovered
from store shelves.
   The company, a subsidiary of Oster-Sunbeam Appliance, has set up
a toll-free telephone number (1-800-441-7068) to help consumers
determine if their mixers should be returned. Replacement mixers
will be provided free of charge, the company said.

<HEAD>Hurricane Warnings Come Down As Storm Heads Past Islands</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Gustav curved away from outer Caribbean
islands Monday and aimed its 105 mph winds toward open ocean.
   Gustav _ which reached hurricane strength Sunday while heading
west toward the Leeward Islands _ turned north onto a path that
would skirt the island chain and take it out into the Atlantic.
Storm warnings in the islands, which stretch north from the
Venezuelan coast, were droppped, but forecasters said rough seas
and surf might be experienced.
   ``They'll probably get a little of the fringe effects,'' said
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables. ``But the hurricane itself looks like it's going to
pass to the east.''
   At 3 p.m. EDT, Gustav was centered near 17.4 degrees north
latitude and 58.2 degrees west longitude, or about 240 miles east
of Antigua. It was moving north at 10 mph and was expected to hold
that course and speed for the next day or two.
   Gustav had hurricane-force winds extending 35 miles from its
center and tropical storm-force winds extending outward 175 miles.
   Over the weekend, islanders with strong memories of last year's
Hurricane Hugo had scrambled to prepare for Gustav's expected
onslaught.
   In Montserrat, a British colony devastated by Hugo, banks,
hardware stores, pharmacies and supermarkets opened Sunday.
   Utilities called workers back from vacation, and the 100-member
police and 50-strong volunteer army were fully mobilized.
   ``The level of preparedness and the level of activity is
significantly greater than it was last year'' before Hugo, said
Reuben Meade, the government's director of development. ``They are
out there in earnest.''
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Hortense remained about a thousand
miles to the east in the mid-Atlantic, a hindrance only to shipping.
   At noon EDT Monday, Hortense had winds of 45 mph. It was moving
north-northwest at about 8 mph.
   The storm was centered near 19.1 degrees north latitude, 41.8
degrees west longitude, or about 1000 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands of Africa. It wasn't expected to gain strength, but
forecasters planned to keep an eye on it.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.

   President Bush said today that he
sees little improvement in chances for a diplomatic settlement to
the crisis in the Middle East but wished U.N. negotiators well in
their effort.
   ``Saddam Hussein has been so resistant to complying with
international law that I don't yet see fruitful negotiations,''
Bush said during a joint news conference with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Bush reiterated U.S. opposition to any agreement that would back
away from demands for a complete withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and
restoration of the former leadership.
   Bush said the demand for total Iraqi withdrawal ``is not
negotiable.''
   ``There is no room for compromise nor negotiation on that
point,'' he said.
   ``There is no flexibility on Iraq getting out of Kuwait and the
(former) rulers being permitted to come back,'' Bush declared.
   ``There's no compromise on the question on getting the
legitimate government back and getting the illegitimate invaders
out,'' he added.
   The president also supported his administration's decision to
cut by two-thirds the staff of the Iraqi embassy in Washington and
to limit the travel of those remaining to no more than 25 miles.
   He disputed that the action, announced earlier in the day by the
State Department, might provoke tensions further.
   ``Nobody will be held against their will. They're all free to
go. We're trying to keep some reasonable parallel in terms of
numbers,'' Bush said.
   Asked if he was more optimistic now than earlier about a
diplomatic settlement, Bush said: ``I don't particularly see more
hope now... It's so clear that what the world is demanding of
Saddam Hussein (is): Get out of Kuwait and restore the rightful
leaders to their place.''
   The president said he had a call in to UN General Secretary
Javier Perez de Cuellar, who will meet with Iraq officials in
Jordan on Thursday in a mediation attempt.
   Bush insisted, however, that the United States would not back
down from the UN demand for a full Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
And, he said, ``it's inconceivable that he (Perez de Cuellar) would
not have that message'' in his talks. ``It's so clear, it's so
obvious.''
   He praised Mulroney for its decision to send three ships to the
Persian Gulf in support of the trade embargo, despite some earlier
Canadian reservations.
   For his part, Mulroney called Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``a
rogue leader ... who sought to annex another nation. And the world
turned against him.''
   ``We're very pleased with the decision of the United Nations
Security Council'' in backing a full naval blockade of Iraq,
Mulroney said.
   Bush and Mulroney spoke to reporters under clear skies outside
the president's family vacation complex on the Atlantic Ocean.
   Mulroney was here for a 24-hour visit. Bush was to return to
Washington on Tuesday and will remain in the capital before
returning here on Thursday.
   In other comments, Bush:
   _ Said he was ``very pleased'' with Soviet support for the UN
embargo against Iraq, even though it doesn't include military help.
He said he had not yet talked to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
about recent developments.
   _ Insisted only a ``tiny minority'' of the Arab world supports
``this outrageous aggression'' by Iraq. ``It's true and everyone
knows it's true.''
   _ Declared he remains ``on top of the situation'' despite his
vacationing. He cited meetings with top aides and his planned
return to Washington this week and a previous trip back a week ago.
   Earlier, the White House said Iraq ``has once again reneged on
its pledge'' in refusing to allow a full convoy of dependents of
U.S. diplomats to leave the country.

   Earlier, the White House said Iraq ``has once again reneged on
its pledge'' in refusing to allow a full convoy of dependents of
U.S. diplomats to leave the country.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said ``our best
estimate'' is that 63 Americans are missing or being held by Iraq,
including seven Americans ``known to be picked up over the
weekend.''
   Fitzwater, speaking in advance of a meeting between Bush and
Mulroney, said the president plans to return to Washington on
Tuesday and not resume his Maine vacation until Thursday.
   Mulroney, his wife, Mila, and their three children arrived at
Bush's seaside home at noon by helicopter.
   Fitzwater noted that three members of the convoy of American
dependents to reach the Turkish border late Sunday had been
detained.
   Fifty-two others were permitted to leave the country.
   ``We are disappointed that the Iraqi government has once again
reneged on its pledge to allow the entire convoy to depart,''
Fitzwater said. ``We've been in touch with Iraqi officials in
Baghdad and Washington and continue to urge the safe release of all
Americans and foreign nationals.''
   In Washington, U.S. officials said the State Department summoned
Iraq's ambassador today and informed him that new restrictions were
being imposed on the movement of Iraqi diplomats in the United
States.
   As to what progress this week's talks might produce, Fitzwater
said: ``It remains to be seen. We wouldn't want to characterize
this effort. ...Certainly we are pleased with the role the U.N. is
taking at this point.''
   ``We are willing to give it time and continue to pursue the
objectives we have in place,'' he added.
   Fitzwater noted that the United Nations had called for a
``complete and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Beirut radio station said Monday that
Anglican church envoy Terry Waite would be the next hostage to be
freed by pro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon.
   The communist-run Voice of the People also said all six American
hostages would be freed once Iran's frozen assets in the United
States are released.
   The station, respected for its balanced reporting and
investigative work, said it drew the conclusions from interviews
with Iranian and Syrian officials as well as Shiite Moslem leaders
after the release of five Western hostages in the past four months.
   The latest to be freed was Irish teacher Brian Keenan, who was
set free Friday and is undergoing medical tests in a Dublin
hospital.
   The first two were Americans Robert Polhill and Frank Reed,
freed 10 days apart in April.
   Swiss orthopedic specialists of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, Emanuel Christen and Elio Erriquez, were released
respectively Aug. 8 and 13 after 10 months in captivity.
   ``Sources familiar with the hostage issue are certain that Terry
Waite is the next in line for freedom after Keenan,'' the station
said in a 15-minute evaluation of the hostage issue.
   Waite disappeared after leaving a west Beirut hotel Jan. 20,
1987 for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, a group that claims to
hold American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland.
   No group has claimed holding the 51-year-old Englishman, from
Styal in Cheshire, and none of the freed hostages has mentioned
seeing him in captivity.
   Several Lebanese Shiite leaders lately asserted that Waite was
alive and well, which suggests he is being held separately from the
12 other hostages in Lebanon.
   Keenan said upon his release that he had seen Anderson and
British journalist John McCarthy in captivity and that both of them
were well.
   Voice of the People quoted an unnamed source close to the
Iranian Embassy in Beirut as saying Waite and other European
hostages held in Lebanon would benefit from ``positive stands
lately taken by France and Britain toward Iran.'' It did not
elaborate.
   France in July pardoned and freed from prison five members of a
pro-Iranian assassination team. The French Foreign Ministry said
the release of the Swiss captives may have been a result of that.
   Britain has recently distanced itself from ``The Satanic
Verses,'' a novel by British author Salman Rushdie who is under an
Iranian death order for writing the book. Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd said this monthy his government had no wish to insult Islam
and understood that Rushdie's book offended Moslems. Hussein
Musavian, director general for West European Affairs at the Iranian
Foreign Minstry, said that met conditions set by an Iranian
parliamentary ruling last year for resumption of ties with Britain.
   There are four Britons, two West Germans and an Italian in
addition to the six Americans held in Lebanon.
   The station quoted the unnamed source as saying ``the solution
of the question of Iranian frozen assets in the United States will
promptly lead to the termination of the plight of the American
hostages in Lebanon.''
   Mohammad Asfahanian, the Iranian Embassy press officer, denied
in the radio program that his government was seeking ``financial or
political rewards for its humanitarian efforts'' to gain the
release of the hostages.
   ``We segregate the Iranian efforts to get the frozen assets and
our legal rights from the hostages' issue,'' Asfahanian was quoted
as saying.
   The radio station did not attempt to explain the discrepancy
between what its anonymous source and the statement by Asfahanian.
   Iran has an estimated $2 billion of assets frozen in the United
States as a result of the 1979 overthrow of the pro-U.S. monarchy
in Tehran and the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
   Asfahanian said efforts by the West to gain the release of four
Iranian diplomats missing in Lebanon since Israel's 1982 invasion
would encourage Iran to step up efforts to free the Western
hostages.
   He said Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's government has
lately obtained information that all four missing Iranians are
alive, despite assertions by the U.S. government that they were
dead.
   Voice of the People quoted Shiite leader Hussein Musawi, reputed
mentor of hostage-holding factions in Lebanon, as saying ``1990 was
supposed to be the year of freedom for all Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   ``But the American military intervention in Saudi Arabia after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has lessened the chances of freedom for
the American captives in the foreseable future.
   ``This is the logic of things as they stand now. But if they
take an illogical course soon, then it is possible that something
contrary to what I am saying could happen,'' Musawi said.

<HEAD>Qatar Joins Other Arab States In Offering Military Facilities</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state of Qatar on Monday joined other
Arab states in the Persian Gulf in making available military
facilities to the growing multinational force being deployed to
deter any Iraqi attack.
   The move means that most of the countries in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council alliance have now agreed to open military
facilities to the U.S.-led force.
   The decision was announced in a statement issued after a meeting
of the government and Parliament that was led by the emir.
   The statement carried by the official Qatar News Agency said
only that Qatar ``has agreed to extend military facilities to some
friendly countries at their request.''
   The emir of Qatar, Sheik Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, was quoted
as citing the ``international unanimity'' represented in today's
decision.
   ``It is Qatar's duty as a GCC state and a member of the Arab
League and the joint Arab defense pact, as well as the United
Nations, to participate in the Arab and international effort,'' the
emir was quoted as saying by the agency.
   The emir said that the ``consecutive developments in the region
required that some sister and friendly states deploy military force
in the gulf waters and in the Gulf Cooperation Council member
states to help these countries repulse possible aggression.''
   Qatar did not specify what military facilities would be made
available or which countries would be able to use them. However,
the country has traditionally cooperated militarily with Britain
and France.
   Three members of the Gulf Cooperation Council _ Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates _ have already agreed to make
military facilities available to the multinational force.
   Another member, Oman, has a long-standing agreement to make
naval facilities available to U.S. and British warships. The
remaining member of the gulf alliance is Kuwait, which was invaded
and occupied by Iraqi troops Aug. 2.
   Bahrain agreed to open its air space and air bases to the
British Royal Air Force and has extended naval facilities to U.S.
and British warships.
   The United Arab Emirates opened its facilities to ground forces
from the United States, Egypt and Pakistan.
   Saudi Arabia is hosting forces from the United States, Britain,
Egypt, Morocco and Syria as well as the gulf alliance as part of
the buildup on its soil aimed at detering a possible attack by
Iraqi troops massed in Kuwait.
   The Qatar News Agency said that during Monday's meeting the emir
affirmed Qatar's condemnation of the Iraqi invasion and occupation
of Kuwait. Qatar has insisted on a full Iraqi withdrawal and the
restoration of the Kuwaiti royal family
   Qatar, with a population of about 250,000, is on a peninsula
jutting into the Persian Gulf from the coast of Saudi Arabia.

   Grammy-winning guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan
was remembered upon his death Monday for his rocking Texas
roadhouse blues style and his contributions to the music scene
here, where he got his musical start.
   Vaughan, 35, died in a helicopter crash early Monday in
Wisconsin after performing with rock star Eric Clapton and
guitarist, Robert Cray.
   ``He was a great musician and a very good friend,'' Cray said.
``I'm shocked at what happened.''
   ``He played the blues like he wanted to play to blues, he played
and put blues in places that we, even Muddy Waters, didn't do,''
said blues guitarist Buddy Guy, who performed with Vaughn, Cray and
Clapton on Sunday.
   ``We'll miss Stevie and we'll miss his music,'' said Jeff
Peterson of the PBS-TV program ``Austin City Limits,'' which has
featured Vaughan and his band, Double Trouble.
   Also killed in the crash near East Troy, Wis., were the pilot
and Clapton's agent, a tour manager and a bodyguard.
   Vaughan, who overcame a drug problem to win two Grammy awards,
gained popularity in the middle 1980s with his guitar jamming and
blues sound, borrowed from such music legends as B.B. King.
   ``The loss is a great loss for blues music and all fans of music
around the world,'' King said in a statement. ``He was just
beginning to be appreciated and develop his potential.''
   Vaughan toured this summer with blues singer Joe Cocker and was
to release a new record in September with his brother Jimmie,
another well-known musician who formed The Fabulous Thunderbirds
band.
   ``This is the worst accident to happen to Texas music since
Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper went down in the '50s. It's a void
no one can fill,'' said Casey Monahan, director of the Texas Music
Office.
   In 1959, a plane carrying carrying singers J.P. (The Big Bopper)
Richardson, Buddy Holly and Richie Valens crashed in Iowa. Holly
was from Texas.
   ``There's not an individual in Austin who's not proud of Stevie
and what he's done for us and Austin music. It's tragic for his
fans, his family, everybody,'' said Ernie Gammage, head of the
Austin Music Industry Council.
   Vaughan had a platinum album with Double Trouble in ``Couldn't
Stand the Weather,'' released in 1984. That same year, he won a
Grammy for best traditional blues recording for the song ``Texas
Flood.'' It was on a album featuring several blues artists and
entitled ``Blues Explosion.''
   He won a 1990 Grammy in the contemporary blues category for ``In
Step.''
   Born Stephen Ray Vaughan on Oct. 3, 1954, in Dallas, he began
playing the guitar at age 7, copying his older brother Jimmie. The
two had been working on an album for September release called
``Family Style.''
   In a recent interview, Jimmie Vaughan recalled Stevie's early
interest in music: ``It was my guitar and my records. When I left,
I would say, `Don't touch my guitar because I'm going to get you.
Leave my guitar alone.' And of course, when I would leave, he would
go straight in there and play with my guitar and try to learn what
I had been playing.''
   At 13, Stevie Ray Vaughan began playing in Dallas clubs before
quitting school before his senior year. He moved to Austin in 1972,
returning to Dallas in 1986.
   In addition to his brother, Vaughan is survived by his mother,
Martha.
   A candlelight vigil was planned for Austin's Zilker Park on
Monday night. The Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas planned to play his
music in tribute all day.

   An 84-year-old woman dressed in lavender and
lace nibbled pound cake Monday. A tanned, unshaven man wearing a
pajama top waited in line for barbecued ribs. It was a picnic for
the homeless.
   There were homemade pies, ribs and potato salad for 1,500 people.
   Soup kitchens closed their doors and told their regular patrons
to head to West Park on the city's North Side for the third annual
picnic, sponsored by shelters, hospitals, churches and the
Salvation Army.
   Cecil Johnston, a Salvation Army shelter director, said the
picnic offered homeless people a chance ``to experience an event
that most of us take for granted.''
   The food missions in Pittsburgh usually serve 750 people per
day, Johnston said.
   The elderly woman in a lace blouse and well-combed brown wig,
who would identify herself only as Marlene, said she lost her home
in April after the friends she lived with died. Since then, she's
been living in a shelter, far from her birth place on a Tennessee
farm.
   Because of high blood pressure, her balance is unsteady and she
skinned her knees and one hand when she fell on a sidewalk two
weeks ago. ``So now I use an umbrella to help me get up,'' Marlene
said.
   ``I'm going to die pretty soon,'' she said without expression.
   Another woman wanted to make sure she wouldn't be photographed
as she waited for the food to arrive.
   ``I come to the picnic because of a lack of funds and no home.
I'm going to try to enjoy myself. It's a good thing for homeless
people,'' said the woman, who identified herself as Loloma.
   ``I don't mind being quoted in the newspaper, but I don't want
my picture taken because I'm not on the most-wanted list.''
   Smoke rose from two grills where barbecue sauce was basted on
ribs, burgers, and hot dogs. Tables of salads and pies were set up
under the trees near long tables where neatly dressed men, women
and a handful of children sat. Under a tree, a man in a brown shirt
and green pants was slumped over, quivering, flailing and foaming
at the mouth.
   Two other homeless men looked on, and a picnicker sitting next
to the seizure victim chowed down impassively.
   Joseph Richards, 24, sought help from police for the man.
   ``Why don't they build more shelters for people to stay in?'' he
asked.
   He said he considered petty crimes so he could get arrested and
get a bed for the night. ``I'd be in jail, but I least I'd be
getting three meals a day,'' he said.
   Light of Life shelter chef Lorenzo Johnson said the city could
use 1,000 more beds. Instead, people end up sleeping on grates, in
cardboard boxes and sprawled out in the park.
   Not everyone enjoyed the gathering.
   ``The Salvation Army just gets money from it,'' said a
weathered-looking David Ferneza, who said he had been accused of
dealing drugs in Erie. ``It's just a bunch of lies like always.''
   But despite the complaints, volunteer Ken Keith, who spooned
coleslaw onto plates, said he enjoyed helping out.
   ``Somebody's got to help feed the homeless.''

   The State Department on Monday ordered the
expulsion of 36 members of the Iraqi Embassy staff and imposed
strict travel limits on the 19 envoys allowed to remain.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the move came in response to
the ``illegal order'' by Iraqi authorities to close the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait. The State Department has refused to comply with
that order.
   The 19 Iraqis permitted to remain in the United States,
including Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat, reflects the same number of
Americans accredited to the U.S. embassies in Iraq and Kuwait.
   At a news conference at his Maine vacation home, President Bush
said the United States was ``trying to keep a reasonable parallel
in terms of numbers.''
   He also noted that although many Americans cannot leave Iraq or
Kuwait, Iraqis in this country won't be detained.
   ``Nobody will be held against their will,'' Bush said. ``They're
all free to go.''
   The expelled Iraqis were given 72 hours to leave the country, a
U.S. official said. Among those expelled are seven accredited
diplomats, including all those who deal with commercial affairs.
   Diplomats at Iraq's U.N. mission in New York City are not
affected by the order.
   ``I don't think it was warranted or called for,'' Sami Jabbouri
of the Iraqi Embassy press office here said about the explusion
order. ``It is just part of the nerve war by the U.S. authorities
because they don't want a solution.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said the Iraqi diplomats allowed to remain in the
United States will be restricted to travel within a 25-mile radius
of Washington.
   In addition, all Iraqi diplomatic visas will be changed from
multiple entry to single entry, tighter controls will be imposed on
unofficial Iraqis wishing to visit the United States and use of
Iraqi Embassy funds for students and other humanitarian needs will
be ``closely controlled,'' she said.
   The move follows by three days the Iraqi deadline for closing
the U.S. Embassy and other foreign missions in Kuwait. Ms. Tutwiler
said that order was in ``brazen defiance'' of mandatory U.N.
Security Council resolutions.
   Iraqi authorities have cut off water and electricity at the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait and are restricting all personnel to the embassy
grounds.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the reduced U.S. embassy staff in Kuwait has
enough food and water only to last several more days. Power is
being supplied by a generator.
   The United States has refused to close its embassy in Kuwait
because it does not want to lend legitimacy to Iraq's conquest and
subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   Seven more Americans were taken by Iraqi authorities into
custody over the weekend, bringing the total to 63 _ 42 in Iraq and
21 in Kuwait, Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said that Iraq has repeatedly failed to provide U.S.
officials with a list of those Americans in their custody and
consular access to them, calling that a clear violation of
international law.
   Ms. Tutwiler preceded her announcement of the expulsions with a
ringing denunciation of Iraq's recent behavior.
   ``Since its brutal aggression against Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iraq has
demonstrated a blatant disregard for international law and the
norms of civilized society through a series of acts,'' she said.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger apprised
Al-Mashat of the U.S. actions at a morning meeting at the State
Department.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States was urging other
governments, particularly those whose embassies have been affected
by Iraqi actions in Kuwait, to consider taking similar actions
against Iraq's official and non-official presence in their
countries.
   She said representatives 34 other countries that are trying to
maintain embassies in Kuwait were invited to a rare State
Department meeting late Sunday night for a briefing on the U.S.
action against Iraq.
   In another matter, Ms. Tutwiler said the department was unable
to confirm reports that Iraq had decided to allow its ships to be
boarded for inspection.
   ``We certainly hope they are true because that is obviously a
very peaceful way to go about enforcing this embargo,'' she said.

   An Army Reserve unit of attorneys and paralegals
with expertise in international law reported to active duty Monday,
a spokesman at Hanscom Air Force Base said.
   The nine-member unit is the 46th Judge Advocate General
Detachment comprising six lawyers and three paralegals, including
two women. They were called up Saturday and told to report Monday
to their unit's headquarters in Boston, Reserves spokesman John
Prowse said.
   Prowse said he didn't know whether the detachment would remain
in Boston or be sent overseas as part of the troop buildup in the
Persian Gulf.
   On Friday, two Army National Guard units in Massachusetts were
put on alert status but not given a time or place to report for
duty, said 1st Lt. David Guido, spokesman for the Massachusetts
National Guard in Reading.
   Those units are the Hingham-based 1058th Transportation Company,
which drives and maintains 5-ton vehicles for moving cargo and
troops. The other is the Reading-based 704th Transportation
Detachment based at Camp Curtis Guild, a traffic coordination unit.

   A Lebanese-American man and his 8-year-old son
returned to Massachusetts after dodging automatic gunfire while
crossing the desert out of Kuwait.
   Bassam Mohtady, 34, and his son, Sammer, of Saugus, were among
about 3,000 Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait since Saddam
Hussein's troops invaded Aug. 2. They ended their journey Sunday at
Logan International Airport here.
   Mohtady, who was in Kuwait to manage an office for his company,
World Book Inc., said he and other foreigners met and made plans to
leave the country together on Aug. 16.
   ``We started out with 21 cars and we only made it with six,''
Mohtady told reporters at the airport. ``So you can imagine what
happened to the rest of them. We have no idea.''
   Mohtady said that his caravan was 12 miles from the Saudi Arabia
border when Iraqi troops appeared.
   ``We had a couple of machine guns that came on us. We did not
get a direct hit,'' Mohtady said. ``But we got the return
(ricochets) of the shells and it blasted the glass of the jeep.
   ``And some other people got stuck there. I think they got a
direct hit. We don't know what happened to them,'' said Mohtady.
``We ran. We panicked and we ran.''
   Sammer went to Kuwait to visit his father in July. The youngster
said he understood the danger of their escape, but was not afraid.
``I kind of figured the war out by myself. It was fun,'' said
Sammer, a third-grader at Waybright School in Saugus.
   Mohtady said his son ducked down in the jeep during the shooting
and both escaped injury. He said the drive to the border is usually
a two-hour trip, but their route through the desert took about 10{
hours because of sand traps.
   He said being in Kuwait after the invasion was like being a
hostage.
   ``We were hostages, somehow. Our freedom was taken away from
us,'' he said. ``We could not move around ... couldn't do
anything.''
   Mohtady, who is of Lebanese decent but has U.S. citizenship,
said he and his son were not harassed by Iraqi troops while they
were in Kuwait because he had secured Lebanese passports for both
of them.
   Once in Saudi Arabia, Mohtady said the Kuwaiti Embassy provided
him and his son a hotel room. The U.S. Consulate there provided
them with airplane tickets back to Massachusetts, he said.

   The families of several soldiers
dispatched to the Persian Gulf have begun turning to each other for
support.
   ``We need people to talk to. We need to know there are others
with children over there,'' said Kathy Collier, whose son Darrin,
24, told her in a telephone call that he was shipping out.
   Collier organized a meeting last weekend with eight other people
who also have family members in the Persian Gulf. They gathered at
a home displaying an American flag and huge yellow ribbon on the
garage door.
   ``It's a little different to know that when President Bush said
he's drawing a line in the sand in Saudi Arabia, these are the kids
he's drawing the line with,'' said Ronnie Muir of Fullerton, whose
son Robert, 20, is with the U.S. Army 82nd Airborne Division.
   At Sunday's meeting, people read letters they had received from
overseas and spoke of their last contacts with family members being
deployed.
   ``It's a scary feeling. Let's face it, you can be as macho as
you want to be. But these are our kids,'' said Bob Archuletta of
Garden Grove. His 27-year-old son, Robert, is among troops
dispatched in the standoff that started when Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   The group is planning a public meeting Sept. 9 at the Crescent
Baptist Church in Anaheim. In an effort to stir up support, group
members also intend to distribute yellow ribbons with the insignia
of military units in the Persian Gulf.

   About 20,000 supporters of the governing
Socialist Party, the former Communist Party, rallied Monday night
near their burned party headquarters. Their leader blamed ``hawks''
in the opposition for the arson.
   About 4,000 opposition supporters standing some distance away
from the rally occasionally whistled in derision, but no incidents
occurred.
   Anti-Communist demonstrators ransacked the building in downtown
Sofia and set it afire Sunday night, incensed by the red star _ the
symbol of Communist, one-party rule _ atop the building.
   The blaze wrecked left much of the building and damaged
adjoining structures.
   Flames licked at the top story of the sprawling eight-floor
granite structure, the largest in Sofia. The fire was put out
shortly after 3 a.m. Monday, about five hours after it began.
   Police on Monday were told to use truncheons and tear gas if
necessary to prevent further violence. Hundreds of officers guarded
the party headquarters.
   Maj. Gen. Parvan Rusinov, deputy chief of Sofia's police force,
said 39 people were arrested after the attack. He said most had
criminal records.
   He also said 17 people were injured, including two policemen.
   State radio said vandals attacked the building before the fire,
and looters carried off television sets and computers.
   The Socialist Party is made up of reform Communists who renamed
themselves earlier this year. They retained the headquarters and
became the only former Communist Party in Eastern Europe to win
multiparty elections after the region's democratic upheaval.
   The party promised last week to remove red stars and other
Communist symbols after an anti-Communist activist threatened to
set himself on fire in protest. But the symbols remained.
   Most windows in the badly burned building were shattered. Debris
and charred paper and pictures were strewn on the sidwalks outside.
   Petar Beron, chairman of the 16-party opposition Union of
Democratic Forces, condemned the vandalism and blamed
``irresponsible elements.''
   Socialist Party leader Alexander Lilov said in a statement to
reporters that ``extremely reactionary forces,'' including ``the
hawks that are among the opposition,'' masterminded the attack.
   Lilov later said on TV that the arson was planned well in
advance, as shown by the attackers' leaving behind a ground plan of
the building, iron bars and other implements.
   Maj. Gen. Rusinov said the Organization for Civil Disobedience,
a group close to the opposition coalition, took the initiative for
the arson.
   The official also quoted Kostantin Trenchev, chief of the
opposition Podkrepa trade union, as demanding on Sunday that the
red star be removed ``or else the building would be stormed,'' the
state BTA news agency reported.
   Rusinov said the ``storming'' was announced by megaphone at 9:50
p.m., 10 minutes after an ultimatum by Trenchev expired. He did not
say who made the announcement.
   The Podkrepa union is part of the Union of Democratic Forces,
the second strongest force in Parliament with 144 of the 400 seats.
The Socialists won 211 seats in June elections.
   Beron called the arson a ``blow against democracy'' and said
Trenchev would have to answer both to security organizations and
the opposition coalition's leadership.
   President Zhelyu Zhelev, who led the Union of Democratic Forces
in the elections, said over radio and TV that the vandalism
``disgraces the young democracy'' and said thwe arsonists benefited
``those who want the establishment of a new dictatorship.''
   The large crowd at Monday's rally indicated the attack may have
boosted the flagging image of the Socialist Party, rent by
dissension and its popularity eroding as the economy deteriorates.
   Lilov told the chanting crowd the party's Supreme Council will
meet in the damaged premises Tuesday ``because we have no other
building.'' He began a fund-raising drive to repair the
headquarters.
   The crowd chanted ``Never, never!'' when speaker after speaker
conjured up the specter of an emerging ``neo-fascism'' in Bulgaria.

   President Bush said Monday he sees
little hope for ``fruitful negotiations'' in the United
Nations-sponsored search for a peaceful solution to the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   He also said it was inconceivable that U.N. Secretary General
Javier Perez de Cuellar will make concessions to Iraq.
   Asked if he was more optimistic than he had been about a
diplomatic settlement, Bush said:
   ``I don't particularly see more hope now because it's so clear
that what the world is demanding of Saddam Hussein. Clearly, the
objective remains the same _ get (Saddam) out of Kuwait and restore
the rightful leaders to their place.''
   Bush ruled out any settlement that did not fulfill those goals.
   The president also said he didn't believe his sanctions against
Iraq's embassy in Washington would worsen the situation because
``nobody will be held against their will.''
   ``They're free to go,'' unlike U.S. diplomats being detained in
Baghdad and Kuwait, Bush said.
   The Iraqi diplomats allowed to stay in the United States will be
restricted in their travel to a 25-mile radius of Washington.
   As to what kind of latitude Perez de Cuellar might exercise in
his talks with the Iraqis, which begin Thursday, Bush said: ``There
is no flexibility on Iraq getting out of Kuwait and the rulers (of
Kuwait) being permitted to come back.
   ``Saddam Hussein has been so resistant to complying with
international law that I don't yet see fruitful negotiations,''
Bush told reporters at a joint news conference with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney at the president's seaside vacation home.
   However, he said, if Perez de Cuellar could make progress in
getting the Iraqis out of Kuwait, ``so much the better,''
   ``The United Nations' position is not negotiable,'' Bush said.
``There is no room for compromise on getting the legitimate
government back and the illegitimate invaders out.''
   The administration has taken a restrained view of Perez de
Cuellar's mediation initiative. Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters earlier Monday that ``it remains to be seen''
whether the talks are likely to offer a promising resolution of the
crisis.
   The United Nations condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
called for Iraqi troops to withdraw and endorsed an economic
embargo against Iraq to be enforced militarily if needed.
   Bush praised Mulroney for sending three Navy vessels to support
the multinational forces, led by the United States' massive
buildup, in the gulf.
   Bush also pointedly praised the Soviet Union for its compliance
with the international sanctions against Iraq.
   Mulroney, calling Saddam a ``rogue leader,'' said the Canadian
government considers its military response acceptable at this point
but has not decided whether to beef up the Canadian presence in the
gulf.
   The prime minister, one of Bush's closest international friends,
said the president should get credit for ``remarkable political
leadership'' that led to the condemnation of Iraq by Arab and
Western nations.
   Bush also said there was no reason to think that because he has
remained on vacation he's not at the helm of U.S. policy in the
crisis.
   ``We're on top of the situation,'' he said. ``I think the
American people understand that.''
   Bush returns to Washington Tuesday to brief members of key
congressional committees and the leadership on his Persian Gulf
strategy.
   The White House said Monday that the planned one-day visit would
be extended to Thursday afternoon to encompass a range of meetings
on budget and other matters.
   Bush continued his vacation activities Monday, up at dawn to
fish in the Kennebunk River as onlookers gathered on the
mosquito-infested banks. The president arrived from a boating
expedition in his speedboat just moments before Mulroney's
helicopter arrived.
   Mulroney brought his wife, Mila, and three children for a repeat
visit of their stay with the Bushes last summer.

<HEAD>Student Don't Like Education, So They Don't Pay $2 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defaults on student loans will cost taxpayers
nearly $2 billion this year, and a major reasons given by people
who welsh on debt is that they are out of work, the Education
Department said Monday.
   Many said they simply didn't like the education they got, the
department said.
   ``Unemployed and without income'' was cited more than any other
reason, slightly ahead of ``working, but insufficient funds,'' the
department said in an 80-page booklet called ``Reducing Student
Loan Defaults: A plan for action.''
   ``Behind the default statistics are students who are either
unable or unwilling to repay their loans,'' says Education
Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos in the introduction.
   ``Many of the defaults could have been prevented if everyone
involved in student loans _ students, post-secondary institutions,
lenders, guarantee agencies and the federal and state governments _
had worked together,'' the report says.
   Many defaulters are confused about the loan process and their
repayment responsibilities, the booklet says. Its first
recommendation is that colleges and trade schools counsel borrowers
on their responsibilities to repay the loans ``even if they do not
complete the program or believe they benefited from the program.''
   A student leaving school or dropping out, should be contacted
immediately and the need for repaying the loan should be
emphasized, the department said.
   The second recommendation is working closely with lenders to
reduce defaults, including notifying the lender when a student
can't be located to allow banks to begin tracing.
   One major reason for defaults, the department found, is the
student's unhappiness with the education he is offered and
reluctance to pay. The percentage is particularly high at
proprietary schools _ such as trade schools.
   Schools should strengthen their curriculum, beef up the quality
of their faculties and update facilities and equipment, the
department report recommends.
   It also calls for improved programs to keep students in school
because many of the defaulters ``are ill-equipped to find
employment later and do not have the means to repay their loans.''
   The book is not intended for students. It is being sent to
higher education associations, lenders and guarantee agencies and
includes examples of the way organizations have used interesting
and innovative approaches to reduce defaults.
   The total of student loan defaults is $7.8 billion, of which
$1.9 billion was added last year.
   In the current fiscal year the program will lend $11 billion to
4.1 million students.
   ``If defaults were a separate program, it would be the
fastest-growing program in the Department of Education today,'' the
booklet says. The department has stepped up its efforts, including
use of legal actions and private collection agencies, increasing
its collections this year to $637 million.

   The White House said it was nothing
like a rescue at sea and there was no real danger to the leaders of
the United States and Canada.
   But there may have been a bit of chagrin on the part of George
Bush when his prized speedboat, Fidelity the Cigarette boat, konked
out on the high seas with Brian Mulroney aboard.
   Bush and his wife Barbara took the visiting Canadian prime
minister and his wife Mila for a spin on the ocean following the
joint Bush-Mulroney news conference Monday.
   No sooner had they sped away from the Bush compound on Walker's
Point, however, when Fidelity suffered an ``alternator burnout,''
according to a written report from the White House press secretary,
Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``Thus the boat was unable to operate,'' the statement said.
   The boaters were transferred to the Coast Guard boat that trails
along when Bush is out on the water.
   ``There was no need for any special rescue of emergency
equipment.
   ``There was never any danger to the president or the prime
minister.
   ``Fidelity is being towed back to Walker's Point,'' Fitzwater
reported.
   There was no word on future employment for the boat mechanic.

<HEAD>Amid Threats, Employer Relents on Reservist Firing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban apartment manager on Monday reversed
his decision to lay off a maintenance man who volunteered for
active duty as an Army reservist.
   While picking up his paycheck last week, Sgt. Charles Mack's
sister found a termination slip saying her brother had been ``laid
off due to being placed on volunteer active military duty for an
indefinite amount of time.''
   A member of the 450th Ordnance Company based in Aiken, S.C.,
Mack responded to a call for active duty volunteers at Fort Bragg,
N.C., on Aug. 16. Unless his tour is extended, he is due back in
Georgia on Friday.
   The layoff notice said the Norcross apartment complex would
rehire Mack ``if a position was available'' at that time.
   But federal law guarantees reservists an unpaid leave of absence
for military duty and re-employment ``with their seniority, status
and pay rate upon return to be as if they were never absent,'' said
Maj. Austin Smith of the National Committee for Employer Support of
the Guard and Reserve. He said that holds true whether the
reservist volunteers or is called up.
   The apartment complex manager, James Bell, said Monday he didn't
know the law when he issued the pink slip. He said the employer
support committee had now explained the requirements and he would
abide by them.
   The employer support committee intercedes in reservist-employer
conflicts, and the U.S. Department of Labor helps reservists take
such cases to court if employers don't relent. Only 3 percent of
the cases ever wind up in court, said Jim Bishop, a veterans
programs specialist with the Labor Department.
   Smith said this is the first reservist firing he has heard of
since reserve units were placed on alert for the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Bell initially said he had fired Mack, but later retracted the
statement. ``He was temporarily laid off,'' he said. ``I can't just
shut my business down. I had to hire people to fill in. It's not
like I cast him out in a briar patch with no recourse. He is doing
a very honorable service to serve his country.''

   A Chinese fighter pilot who was trying to defect
to the United States was spotted after he flew into Soviet airspace
and was forced to land at a military airfield at Vladivostok,
Soviet media reported Monday.
   No word surfaced on whether the Soviets would return the pilot
or the jet to China. Nor was anything said about the pilot's
intended destination if he wanted to ask for U.S. political asylum.
   The Chinese-made MiG-19 fighter was flying at an altitude of
only 100 feet on Sunday, but it was detected as soon as it crossed
the Soviet border and was intercepted by Soviet air defense forces,
Col. Gen. Vladimir Litvinov told the government newspaper Izvestia.
   Izvestia said the pilot, who was not identified, flew deep into
Soviet territory in the Far East. He passed over the landing strip
at Vladivostok Airport without responding to calls from an air
traffic controller, then changed course and landed at the military
field using a braking parachute.
   Litvinov said the pilot's first request after landing was for
food. After he was fed, he was turned over to investigators, the
general said.
   A KGB spokesman told Izvestia the circumstances of the flight
were unclear. `It has been established, however, that the Chinese
pilot was motivated by political considerations and intended to go
to the United States,'' Izvestia said.

<HEAD>Mideast Tensions Spark Call To Duty For Some</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the Mideast in turmoil, military recruiters
say they're getting lots of calls from patriotic citizens, many of
them old soldiers or fresh-faced boys ineligible to wear a uniform
and carry a gun.
   But they call anyway, eager to serve.
   ``The majority of them aren't eligible, just because of age,''
said Sgt. 1st Class Robert Maydoney, an Army recruiter in
Providence. R.I. ``But we get a lot of Vietnam vets, Korean vets, a
lot of old-timers who want to help.''
   A 54-year-old Korean War veteran called ``asking if he could get
back in. He felt it was important, with what was going on,''
Maydoney said.
   Most of the interest seems directed at the Army, which accepts
recruits from age 17 to 35.
   Air Force, Navy and Marine officials reported little change in
the number of would-be recruits since Iraq invaded Kuwait and
thousands of U.S. troops were deployed to the Persian Gulf.
   ``Absolutely we've been getting more calls,'' said Sgt. First
Class Rick Henager, an Army recruiter in Hyannis. ``We're talking
about an increase of 1,000 percent on some days.''
   On his busiest day since the crisis began, Henager said, he got
23 or 24 call, compared to the two or three he gets on a normal day.
   Henager took a call from a young man who had won a four-year
college scholarship but wanted to be a medic in the Middle East if
war broke out.
   ``He said, `Look, I'm all set with my education. But if we do go
to war I want to be a part of it.' Another kid said, `I've lived in
this country 19 years. It's time I started helping with the rent.'
''
   First Sgt. Bengt Bernhardsen is in charge of 12 Army recruiting
stations in the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx,
the largest such Army unit on the East Coast. He said he received
10 to 15 calls a day ``from all walks of life, all age groups,
asking about joining the military.''
   ``It has really surprised me. It's nice to see patriotism hasn't
died. It's alive and living in New York,'' he said.
   In Louisville, Ky., one of the busiest booths at this year's
Kentucky State Fair was the National Guard display.
   At past fairs, the booth got about 100 inquiries, said Army Sgt.
1st Class Ray Jones, a recruiter for the Army Reserve.
   ``This year, we've had 250 to 300 leads ... possible recruits,''
he said. The 11-day fair ended Sunday.
   Americans haven't cornered the market on patriotism. A U.S.
Marine recruiting office in Buffalo, N.Y., is getting about five
calls a day from Canadians wanting tough Marine training.
   ``It's kind of sad because we're getting more Canadians calling
than we are getting American kids,'' said Sgt. John Taylor.
   In Pittsburgh, recruiters said nurses' interest in joining the
Navy increased after troops went to the Middle East.
   ``We have seen quite a bit of interest from people who want to
serve, particularly nurses,'' said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Shannah Hensler
said. ``And just walking down the street, we get a lot of favorable
comments from civilians.''
   Still, many who feel the call of duty simply can't serve.
   ``Before this started only about 10 percent of the people who
wanted to enlist could enlist,'' Henager said. ``Of the ones
calling in now it's probably less than 10 percent who are
eligible.''
   Maydoney said it wasn't easy telling would-be warriors they
couldn't fight.
   ``A lot of them can't understand it, they feel they can still
give something to their country,'' Maydoney said. ``They say, `Well
maybe I can't be an infantryman but maybe I can train someone
else.'''

   Rain extended over the South on Monday and from the northern
Plains to New England, and a heat wave hit the central part of the
nation.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from eastern North
Dakota into northwestern Minnesota, over southeastern Wisconsin,
across Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and New York state into
New England.
   North Dakota had hail as big as golf balls at Akra, Cavalier and
near Walhalla.
   In southeastern New York state, wind gusts during thunderstorms
damaged power lines and a tree near Monroe, the National Weather
Service reported.
   Some trees also were downed in the New York City borough of
Queens.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered over North
Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, southern
Mississippi, and southeastern Louisiana.
   Elsewhere, rain spread from northwestern California into
southwestern Oregon.
   The weather service reported noon heat indexes _ a combination
of temperature and humidity _ of 108 at Kirksville, Mo., and
Quincy, Ill.; 106 at Columbia, Mo.; 104 at St. Louis, Mo.; 103 at
Cape Girardeau, Mo.; 101 at Springfield, Mo., and Sioux Falls,

   Record high temperatures included 104 at Austin, Texas; 98 at
Corpus Christi, Texas; 96 at Galveston, Texas; and 104 at North
Platte, Neb. Lake Charles, La., tied its record of 98 and Wichita,
Kan., tied its record of 102. The high at Galveston toppled a

   Some schools in eastern Nebraska closed early or didn't open at
all as the state entered the fifth day of a heat wave expected to
last through the week.
   Bakersfield, Calif., cooled to a record-tying low of 56.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 61 at
Kalispell, Mont., to 104 at Medicine Lodge, Kan., and Wichita, Kan.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 29 at Jackson, Wyo.,

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
refused Monday to heed calls for her resignation and said elections
set for November would be held as scheduled.
   Seven of the 12 political groups that in March appointed Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot provisional president have called for her
resignation and said they would refuse to participate in elections
under her administration. Five Cabinet ministers also resigned last
week.
   ``I will not fail to assume all the way to the end the
responsibility'' of holding elections, Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said
at the installation of her newly constituted 13-member Cabinet.
   ``No one can believe that deviations from the will of the
people'' can halt the electoral process, Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said
in a speech broadcast on state radio.
   The seven parties have also declared support for the Council of
State, which broke off relations with the president Aug. 14,
describing her as an obstacle to credible elections.
   The 19-member Council of State, which is supposed to have veto
power over Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, has accused her of abuse of power
and of refusing to satisfy popular demands for administrative
reform, law and order and economic relief.
   On Saturday, the Chamber of Commerce and several other business
groups asked the president to ``postpone any decision which
requires the approval of the Council of State'' so as not to
aggravate the crisis.
   The new Cabinet was appointed without the council's advice and
consent.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court judge, was appointed
president by a political coalition known as the Unity Assembly,
which spearheaded opposition to Haiti's last military ruler, Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril. He fled into exile in the United States in
March after a week of violent protests.
   Although seven of the 12 groups that comprise the Unity Assembly
are now calling for her resignation, Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot said the
five most important groups remained on her side.
   ``We must note with satisfaction that important political
groups, representative of the majority of the electorate,'' are on
the election trail. Those who refuse elections are ``on the
periphery of reality,'' she said.
   Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation of 6 million
inhabitants, has had five different governments since the fall of
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier in February 1986. Four of the
governments have been led or controlled by the ill-disciplined
army, which is widely accused of corruption.
   The current civilian administration was set up to lead the
country to its first democratic elections since independence from
France in 1804.
   Haiti tried to hold free and fair elections on Nov. 29, 1987,
but the elections were canceled after assassins supported by the
army massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations.

   Funeral services will be held in Toronto on
Wednesday for Canadian novelist and short story writer Morley
Callaghan, who died over the weekend after undergoing surgery four
weeks earlier. He was 87.
   His sons Barry, also an author, and Michael were at his side
when he died Saturday. The nature of his illness was not disclosed.
Callaghan's wife died six years ago.
   Callaghan's writings spanned more than 60 years. Besides winning
acclaim at home, his works were well received in Western Europe,
the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and Romania, and wered translated into
Chinese.
   After his graduatuation from law school in 1928, Callaghan got
married and headed straight for Paris with his bride. He mixed with
Ernest Hemingway, Scott Fitzgerald, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and
other literary figures there and in 1928 saw ``Strange Fugitive,''
the first of his more than 20 novels, published. His novel ``The
Loved and the Lost'' won Canada's 1952 Governor General's Award.
Callaghan was also nominated for a Nobel Prize in literature.
   His other novels include ``A Native Argosy,'' ``Now that April's
Here,'' ``Stories,'' ``They Shall Inherit the Earth,'' ``The Many
Colored Coat,'' ``A Passion in Rome,'' ``A Fine and Private
Place,'' ``Philo of Crete,'' and ``A Wild Old Man on The Road.''
   He also lived in New York and on a Pennsylvania farm, writing
for many American magazines, but returned to Toronto as the
birthplace and home he never forgot.

<TEXT>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro said Monday his
country has seized 6,000 tons of U.S.-bound cocaine and arrested
more than 400 foreign drug traffickers over the past five years,
the Mexican news agency Notimex reported.
   Castro spoke at the opening of a U.N.-sponsored conference on
crime prevention held in Havana, the Cuban capital.
   Notimex said Castro told the conference that Cuba is studying
harsher penalties against drug traffic.
   Cuban Justice Minister Juan Escalona recently said Cuba might
impose a death penalty on foreigners convicted of drug crimes on
the island. He said most of those arrested have been U.S. citizens
of Cuban descent.
   Castro said that since 1985, Cuba has seized more than 125 tons
of marijuana, as well as the 6,000 tons of U.S.-bound cocaine, and
arrested more than 400 foreign drug traffickers.
   The report did not give any further detail about the accused
drug traffickers.
   Castro said the country has confiscated 73 boats and more than
50 airplanes used to transport drugs.
   Notimex quoted the Cuban leader as saying his country is willing
to cooperate with the United Nations to combat drug traffic. But he
said it was essential to solve the problem of drug consumption in
United States.
   Cuba is sometimes used as a waystation by drug traffickers
shipping products from South America to the United States.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Monday the Voice of
America television station aimed at Cuban viewers has passed a
five-month preliminary test and will become a permanent operation.
   That means Cubans who get up early enough to watch the pre-dawn
programming and whose television reception escapes Cuban jamming
efforts will be able to watch the news, movies and shows such as
``Cheers'' and ``Mission Impossible.''
   Bush's announcement releases $16 million that had been withheld
pending a presidential determination that the operation was both
legal and technically feasible.
   The station, called TV Marti, has been broadcasting news and
entertainment shows on a trial basis since March 27. Cuba has
jammed the broadcasts since the first day and has said that effort
has been virtually 100 per cent successful.
   The TV Marti signal is sent from a balloon tethered over the
Florida keys.
   TV Marti airs from 3:30 a.m. to 6 a.m. each day. The broadcasts
are timed so that they do not interfere with local programming.
U.S. officials said that to do otherwise would violate
international regulations.
   In the announcement, made public at Bush's vacation retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine, presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said the testing period demonstrated that TV Marti did not
interfere with Florida television broadcasting and did not violate
international telecommunications agreements.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro has denounced TV Marti as illegal
and a ``gross interference'' in Cuba's internal affairs.
   A survey commissioned by the U.S. Information Agency, which
oversees TV Marti, said polls of Cuban emigres indicated there were
about 273,000 households in the station's target area which
``should be able'' to receive broadcasts at least occasionally.
   But an unpublished report by the General Accounting Office, a
congressional watchdog agency, said the administration ``vastly
overestimated'' TV Marti viewership. A copy of the report was
obtained last week by the Miami Herald, which said classified State
Department estimates indicate the viewership is only about 50,000
to 70,000.
   According to the Herald, the GAO faulted the administration for
its methodology in obtaining the viewership estimates. Most of
those polled were Cubans who have emigrated since TV Marti went on
the air five months ago.
   Fitzwater said in his announcement that the rationale for TV
Marti is that it provides free access to information for people who
are denied that right.
   The statement regretted the Cuban jamming effort but said the
experience of U.S. government sponsored broadcasts to Eastern
Europe during the Cold War era was that attempts at jamming often
were ineffectual.
   The Voice of America has been beaming radio broadcasts tailored
for Cuban audiences since 1985. Cuba began jamming the operation,
known as Radio Marti, in the Havana area shortly after the TV Marti
tests began.

   Warning that reading could become a ``lost art''
among high school students, the College Board reported Monday that
SAT scores sank for the third consecutive year. Verbal averages
dropped to their lowest levels in a decade.
   Scores on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test in
the 1989-90 school year fell 3 points to 424 _ the lowest since
1980 and equal to the lowest levels since annual averages were
first compiled in 1971.
   Scores on the math section averaged 476, unchanged for the
fourth straight year.
   The steady, four-year slide in verbal scores from a recent peak
of 431 in 1986 is ``disturbing but not particularly surprising,''
said College Board president Donald M. Stewart.
   ``Students must pay less attention to videogames and music
videos and begin to read more.''
   Blame for the poor verbal scores rests with parents and schools,
Stewart said in an interview.
   ``The requirement to read through homework has been reduced.
Students don't read as much because they don't have to read as
much,'' he said.
   ``Reading is in danger of becoming a lost art among too many
American students _ and that would be a national tragedy.''
   Among the few bright spots in the gloomy report: Women's math
scores reached their best levels in 16 years, scores of American
Indians rose a combined 13 points, and black test-takers continued
a 15-year trend as the most improved ethnic group.
   The SAT, taken by 1.03 million college-bound high school
students, is a two-part multiple-choice exam, each scored on a
scale of 200-800. It is sponsored by the College Board, and
administered by the Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J.
It is the predominant college entrance exam in 22 states.
   Scores on the ACT, the college entrance test that predominates
in 28 states mainly in the Midwest and West, will be released Sept.
11.
   The SAT has become the single most often-cited barometer of the
nation's educational progress, or lack of it.
   This year's scores and the stagnation in student achievement
that they suggest will almost certainly fuel public doubts about
the success of the decade-old school reform movement.
   But the College Board and others caution that no single number
can reasonably summarize the performance of 40 million students
attending 83,000 public schools across the country.
   Critics also have repeatedly accused the SAT and ACT of bias
against women and minorities. The tests' makers deny those charges.
But the SAT is undergoing a massive revision that ETS says should
produce a fairer, more accurate gauge of college aptitude by 1993.
   Among the report's other findings:
   _ The higher a student's family income, the higher the average
score. Test-takers from 151,485 families earning $70,000 or more
averaged 468 on the verbal, 527 on math. The 41,845 test-takers
from families earning less than $10,000 averaged 357 in verbal, 419
math.
   _ Women's math scores rose a point to their highest average in
16 years: 455.
   _ American Indians scored the best year-to-year gains of any
ethnic group: a 4-point gain in verbal averages to 388, and a
9-point rise in math to 437.
   _ Verbal scores among black students rose by 1 point to 352 and
now stand 20 points higher than 1976 levels. Math averages were
down a point to 385, but are still 31 points better than 1976
scores.
   _ Averages among white students dropped 4 points on verbal
scores to 442, and were unchanged at 491 in math.
   _ Non-white students now constitute 27 percent of all SAT
test-takers, up from 25 percent in 1989 and 17 percent in 1980.
   _ Iowa posted the highest state average, a combined 1088 on the
verbal and math. But only 5 percent of high school graduates took
it.
   _ South Carolina, where 54 percent took the test, had the lowest
average _ 834.

organization based in New York representing over 2,700 colleges,
universities, secondary schools and other educational associations.

<HEAD>Five Permanent Security Council Members Begin Talks on Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The five permanent members of the Security
Council opened private talks Monday aimed at breaking an impasse in
efforts to end Cambodia's 11-year-old civil war.
   The permanent council members _ the United States, the Soviet
Union, China, Britain and France _ are discussing a formula for
establishing a multiparty transitional Cambodian administration
that would organize free elections after a cease-fire, said a U.S.
official, speaking privately.
   The transitional administration, or Supreme National Council,
would work with U.N. agencies and officials in organizing the
elections, the official said.
   Diplomats from the five nations were expected to brief U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Tuesday on the outcome
of their discussions.
   They were also expected to consult with representatives of
Vietnam and the Cambodian guerrilla coalition, as well as with
officials from other countries in the region.
   Richard Solomon, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian
affairs, was leading the U.S. delegation in the private talks.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, a U.S. official said he expected that the
five permanent council members would propose a new formula for the
composition of the Supreme National Council in an effort to break
the latest impasse in peace talks.
   Alexander Watson, U.S. permanent representative to the United
Nations, said he expected that the permanent council members would
propose that the Supreme National Council be comprised of people
chosen in their individual capacities rather than as
representatives of specific Cambodian factions.
   ``That's an effort obviously to avoid endless squabbles over
which factions are represented by how many people (and) in which
way,'' Watson said after talks with Thai officials. He was in
Thailand on a six-nation Asian trip.
   ``This is a historic moment,'' Watson said. ``Never have all the
pieces been in place like they are now for a real shot at getting a
solution to the problem.''
   The Vietnamese-backed Cambodian government and the three
guerrilla groups opposing it have argued over how many seats each
of the factions should have on the Supreme National Council.
   The guerrilla coalition comprises the Khmer Rouge, which has the
strongest guerrilla army, the forces of former Cambodian leader
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
   Vietnam installed the current government after invading Cambodia
in late 1978 and ousting the Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of
thousands of people during its 3{-year reign.
   Watson said he expected the Security Council to agree that the
Supreme National Council would function as an advisory body for a
U.N. interim government.
   In June, Secretary of State James A. Baker III altered the
diplomatic balance on Cambodia when he announced that the United
States was withdrawing its recognition of the guerrilla coalition
and opening talks with Vietnam.
   U.S. officials held their first round of talks with Vietnamese
diplomats last month at Vietnam's U.N. Mission.
   The United States has been assisting the two non-Communist
factions in the guerrilla coalition, led by Prince Sihanouk and
former Premier Son Sann.
   China is the main backer of the Khmer Rouge; while the Soviet
Union has supported Vietnam and the Phnom Penh government.

<HEAD>Pentagon Calls Missile Defense Test `Partial Success'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of a series of tests of sensors
designed to support the Pentagon's ``Brilliant Pebbles''
space-based missile defense system achieved only partial success,
the Defense Department reported Monday.
   The department said that electronic data being sent back to
earth on the functioning of the experiment was cut off in mid
flight.
   But the Pentagon said the 13-minute experiment, launched on
Saturday from the Wallops Island, Va. Flight Facility was a
beneficial first step in the scheduled series of 12 experimental
flights.
   The Brilliant Pebbles component of the Strategic Defense
Initiative or Star Wars would place a cluster of small interceptor
rockets into earth orbit, each capable of detecting the launch of
hostile strategic missiles.
   The interceptor rockets could be ordered to speed toward the
incoming missiles over thousands of miles and destroy them by high
velocity impact.
   The Brilliant Pebbles experimental package was launched aboard a
Black Brant X rocket at 3:04 a.m. Saturday. The Pentagon said the
expendable rocket and its payload landed as planned in the Atlantic.
   The payload was to have been deployed at an altitude of 124
miles but Pentagon officials said they do not yet know if that goal
was achieved.
   ``Only a partial set of objectives was achieved due to a
premature termination of telemetry,'' the Pentagon statement said,
referring to the interrupted flow of electronic data.
   A Pentagon official, who commented on condition he not be
identified by name, said program managers will now try to learn how
much of the experiment was completed, using backup sources from an
aircraft, a satellite and from radars at Wallops Island.
   ``A number of the parts of the launch were very successful and
validated other parts of the experiment,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Jurors Side With Plaintiffs, But Award No Damages</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Contra supply courier Eugene Hasenfus, who
was shot down in Nicaragua, won a partial victory Monday in his
lawsuit against an air carrier and former Air Force Gen. Richard
Secord, but jurors gave him no money.
   Hasenfus had filed a federal civil lawsuit against Secord, a
figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, and Miami-based Southern Air
Transport, contending they controlled the illegal network supplying
the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. He maintained they were responsible
for damages suffered as a result of Nicaraguan soldiers shooting
down a cargo plane Hasenfus was on in October 1986.
   Hasenfus, the sole survivor, was joined in the suit by the
family of co-pilot Wallace Sawyer Jr., who was killed in the crash.
   ``I've had so much taken from me already,'' Hasenfus said.
``This is a disappointment.''
   Jurors found that there was a special relationship or joint
venture among the plantiffs and defendants, but that Hasenfus had
been paid all he was due and that there was no written contract to
cover his legal expenses in Nicaragua.
   Before jurors began deliberations on Aug. 21, U.S. District
Judge C. Clyde Atkins ruled in favor of Secord and Southern Air
that the jury should only consider claims for back salary for
Hasenfus and death benefits for Sawyer's wife of Magnolia, Ark.
   The plaintiffs had sought payment for legal bills, lost income,
mental stress and other items.
   Attorneys for the defendants argued that Hasenfus and Sawyer
were independent contractors who knew the risks of the operation
and to whom the defendants had no special responsibility.
   The jurors disagreed with that but said they could find no
evidence of an written contract or other justification to award any
damages.
   Jurors deliberated for nearly 32 hours over five days. They
apparently were deadlocked for several days last week on the
question of damages and seemed frustrated by the decision they felt
compelled to reach.
   ``We did feel there was a secret operation. We tried very hard
to live by the evidence that they gave us but there wasn't any
proof of any oral agreement,'' juror Wade Harris said.
   Hasenfus, of Marinette, Wis., sought $57,000 in lost and back
pay. His wife, Sally, wanted $66,000 reimbursement for the legal
expense involved in extricating her husband from the Nicaraguan
jail where he spent three months.
   ``They removed their fingerprints quite well from everything,''
Hasenfus said afterward.
   Mrs. Hasenfus said State Department officials had assured her
they would help pay for her husband's legal expenses while he was
held in Nicaragua.
   But Hasenfus' attorneys were unable to link Secord and Southern
Air to those State Department officials, explained one juror.
   ``If we could have proved the State Department (employees) were
agents of Secord and Southern Air, we would have given them
money,'' juror Ivis Charbonier said.
   Secord's attorney, Thomas Spencer, was pleased that no money
damages were awarded.
   ``These fellows were independent contractors. They took those
risks,'' Spencer said.
   Spencer said Secord was overseas and unavailable for comment.
Secord is on probation after a guilty plea to lying to Congress
about the Iran-Contra affair.

   Britons detained by Iraq appeared on Iraqi
television Monday, addressing the camera with assurances to their
families.
   ``It is just as obvious that these people are under constraint
as it was with the last pictures,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
   Iraqi authorities have detained about 200 Britons in Iraq and
157 in Kuwait, which Iraq invaded Aug. 2, the Foreign Office said.
In all, about 21,000 Westerners are standed in Iraq and Kuwait,
including 3,000 Americans.
   An Iraqi broadcast Thursday of President Saddam Hussein visiting
with British hostages was denounced as a manipulative and callous
attempt at propaganda.
   Monday's interviews were featured in a program on Iraqi
television called ``Guest's News'' and in each one the hostage
reassured relatives at home.
   An unidentified woman from Leeds was interviewed lying in a
hospital bed where the television report said she had given birth
to a baby son, Omar.
   Wearing a traditional Arabic head veil, and pictured with
another son, identified as Adnam, she was asked if she had a
message for her family back home and told her family, ``I'm safe,
and not to worry too much.''
   Tony, Pauline and Julian Barlow, who were taken from the Cedar
Beach Hotel in Kuwait by the Iraqis, said nervously, ``We're being
well treated. Everything is safe and we'll see you soon.''
   Chris Myers, sitting with his girlfriend Caroline Hughes, spoke
to his parents, but Miss Hughes said nothing and appeared to be
less relaxed. The couple, stopped at a checkpoint, were among the
first to be detained by the Iraqis.
   The television report showed the detainees in what appeared to
be an apartment. Some were pictured playing pool.
   It also featured other foreign detainees, including a man who
said he was from Hamburg, West Germany, and an Australian named as
Edith Puckeridge.
   Englishwoman Christine Smythe said she was fine and wished her
father a happy birthday.
   Margaret Hare sent her ``Love to everybody'' and Maggie Ross,
shown with what appeared to be her family, told relatives and
friends they were all right.
   ``We want to say that we're together, that we are well and that
the children are being amazingly strong and brave in a very
difficult situation. We hope we will be free to see you soon.''

<HEAD>West African Task Force Seizes Liberian Rebel Gunboat, Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two Nigerian warships captured a
gunboat carrying weapons for forces loyal to Liberian rebel leader
Charles Taylor, a spokesman for West African forces trying to end
Liberia's civil war said Monday.
   Lt. Col. John Dungs of the multinational force said the two
Nigerian warships seized the gunboat Sunday.
   A Ghana news agency correspondent traveling with the
multinational force reported 27 rebels were captured when the
gunboat, a converted trawler, was seized as it was approaching two
Nigerian frigates. The report did not say whether any shots were
fired.
   One of the frigates was carrying Taylor's rival rebel leader,
Prince Johnson, to Freetown to make flight connections for a
meeting in Banjul, Gambia, of parties involved in the Liberian
conflict.
   The two Nigerian frigates and a Ghanaian frigrate were expected
to pick up more men, supplies and armaments in Freetown before
returning to Monrovia, where the multinational force landed Friday
night. It already has advanced out of the port area and secured
some of the city.
   Nigeria, Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Guinea have provided
3,000 troops to end the 8-month-old tribal war in Liberia.
   Taylor, whose forces control most of Liberia, opposes the
intervention and accuses Nigeria and Guinea of supporting embattled
President Samuel Doe. Both Doe and Johnson have welcomed what they
call a peacekeeping force. They have negotiated a truce between
their fighters, who together control most of Monrovia.
   The Ghana news agency correspondent reported the streets of the
Liberian capital of Monrovia were quiet Sunday night, and the only
people in view were residents searching for food. The city has been
without electricity and water for two months, and most food stocks
were looted by government troops or rebels.
   But a spokesman for Taylor's National Patriotic Front accused
the West African force of shelling civilian areas.
   ``They didn't come in with white flag waving, they came in
blasting,'' Taylor's spokesman Tom Woewiyu said in Ouagadougu,
Burkina Faso.
   Taylor has sent Woewiyu on a tour of West African capitals to
try to persuade their heads of state to oppose the presence of
troops from other countries in the region in Liberia.
   Reporters who recently returned from Taylor's headquarters in
Liberia said they had seen some soldiers from Burkina Faso there.
Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore has criticized the decision
to send in the West African force.
   Woewiyu said the West African force was ``a surrogate group put
together by the United States since they couldn't use Prince
Johnson to defeat us.''
   ``They went out and bought themselves some stool pigeons to
carry the job for them.''
   The West African leaders who have sent troops to Liberia say the
war is affecting the entire region, which must cope with an influx
of 400,000 refugees from the nation of 2.3 million people.
   Nine members of the multinational force who were injured in
clashes with Taylor's rebels over the weekend in Monrovia were
airlifted to U.S. Navy vessels for medical treatment, said Abass
Bundu, executive secretary of the Economic Community of West
African states, which ordered the foreign intervention.
   None of the multinational troops had been killed, Bundu said.
   The U.S. ships are providing support for several squads of
Marines guarding the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia.
   Journalists who had been covering territory controlled by Taylor
left during the weekend after the rebel leader accused an American
journalist, Stephen Smith of Liberation of Paris, of being a spy.
Taylor's men conducted a mock execution of Smith, firing just over
his shoulders.
   Taylor's 10,000 fighters represent the largest army in the
country, but many of his troops are teen-agers and inexperienced.
   The civil war has left 5,000 people dead, mainly civilians
slaughtered for their tribal affiliations. The war began in
December when Taylor's forces invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast,
accusing Doe of corruption and mismanagement. Johnson later split
with Taylor.

<HEAD>Sexually Graphic Pictures Important to Exhibition, Curator
Testifies</HEAD>

   Sexually graphic photographs included in a
traveling exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's work were necessary to
understand the life of the late artist, a museum curator testified
Monday.
   ``To have left them out would have been to leave out a chapter
of a novel or a segment of history,'' said Janet Kardon, the
director of the American Craft Museum in New York City, who
assembled the exhibit.
   Mrs. Kardon testified for two hours at a hearing for the
Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie. They are
charged with a misdemeanor count of pandering obscenity for
displaying the homoerotic pictures.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge David J. Albanese summoned Mrs.
Kardon to help resolve a dispute over whether a jury could consider
the pictures individually or whether it must treat the whole
exhibit as a single work of art.
   Prosecutors contend the pictures are separate works. Defense
lawyers disagree and asked Albanese to dismiss the case on the
grounds that the exhibit as a whole isn't obscene.
   Albanese said he would rule Sept. 6 on the request for dismissal.
   The photographs were included in a six-week show that ended May
26.
   Mrs. Kardon said she assembled the 175-photograph exhibit with
Mapplethorpe's help as an overview of his life. Mapplethorpe died
last year at age 42 of AIDS.
   Outrage over the photos contributed to restrictions on federal
funding for the arts.
   Most of the works in the exhibit are portraits or pictures of
flowers, although some show homosexual acts.
   ``You really have to reflect everything an artist felt was
important in their work,'' Mrs. Kardon said. ``For the most part,
this is the only place those (sexually graphic) images appear, and
they were an important part of his work.''
   The judge earlier ordered Barrie and the gallery to stand trial
Sept. 24 on a misdemeanor count involving Mapplethorpe pictures of
naked children.
   That charge and the other of pandering to obscenity each carry a
maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for Barrie.
The gallery could be fined $5,000 on each charge.
   The exhibition has appeared in several U.S. cities, but drew
charges only in Cincinnati.

   A United Airlines jumbo jet carrying 343
people landed safely Monday despite a retracted front landing gear,
authorities said. Ten passengers suffered minor injuries sliding
down the plane's emergency chutes.
   ``It was pretty scary,'' said Joy Wahab, 20, of San Diego. ``We
circled and the pilot tried to put the landing gear down. It didn't
work. He said, `Well, we're going to come down one way or the
other.' ''
   The Boeing 747 skidded to a stop at Los Angeles International
Airport with its nose landing gear stuck in a retracted position.
The 323 passengers and 20 crew members left the plane via emergency
chutes, said Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for Chicago-based United
Airlines.
   Flight 816 originated in Sydney, Australia.
   Ten passengers were treated for minor injuries, said Fire
Department spokesman Greg Acevedo. Most complained of chute burns
and back pain, he said.
   ``It was frightening not knowing what they were going to do,''
said Cassandra Edwards of Berkeley, who sat in the first-class
section above the nose gear. ``There was a point when I heard the
nose scrape on the bottom. That sound is very unnerving, knowing
that the nose is sliding, knowing that at any moment it could
explode.''
   Damage to the aircraft was slight and there were no sparks or
flames upon landing, said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Fred O'Donnell. Several passengers said the landing was smooth.

   A nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant, site of a disastrous 1986 explosion, was shut down Monday
because of a malfunction, Izvestia reported.
   The government newspaper, in a report attributed to Nikolai
Shteinberg, deputy chairman of the State Committee for Nuclear
Power Station Safety, said the staff of Reactor No. 3 shut down the
unit ``in keeping with operational rules.''
   ``Established safety standards were not violated,'' the
newspaper said. It gave no further details on the malfunction.
   It was Chernobyl's Reactor No. 4 that caught fire and exploded
on April 26, 1986, spewing radioactive cesium, strontium and
plutonium over a wide area of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia.
   Official reports say 31 people were killed in the partial
meltdown, but unofficial reports say 250 died. Four years after the
accident, more than 2 million people are still living on
contaminated lands in the region.

   Grammy-winning blues guitarist Stevie Ray
Vaughan was among five people killed early Monday when their
helicopter slammed into a hill in dense fog after leaving a
concert, authorities said.
   The other victims were three members of rock star Eric Clapton's
entourage and a pilot.
   Clapton, who played with Vaughan at the concert Sunday night,
landed safely in Chicago on another helicopter. His publicist,
Ronnie Lippin, announced Vaughan's death.
   Lippin said there was no truth to a report that Vaughan had
begged to get on the helicopter that crashed because it would
arrive at its destination earlier.
   Clapton said the victims, who included his agent, bodyguard, and
tour manager, ``were my companions, my associates, and my friends.
This is a tragic loss of some very special people.''
   The helicopter, owned by Omni Flight Helicopters Inc., crashed
into a field shortly after leaving the Alpine Valley Music Theater,
an open-air stage and ski resort near East Troy, 30 miles southwest
of Milwaukee, said Omni spokesman Phil Huth.
   Wreckage and bodies were scattered over 200 feet, authorities
said.
   Clapton's manager, Roger Forrester, told Britain's Sky News:
``We had four helicopters and Eric and I were in one directly
behind it when it suddenly disappeared from vision.''
   ``Obviously we were not aware of the tragic circumstances until
the early hours when daybreak broke and they discovered it on a ski
slope directly behind the building in which we had just performed.''
   Among the victims was Bobby Brooks, 34, Clapton's agent at
Creative Artists Agency, whose clients also included Crosby, Stills
&amp; Nash; Whoopi Goldberg; Pat Benatar; Jackson Browne and Dolly
Parton.
   Walworth County Coroner John Griebel identified the other
victims as Nigel Browne of London, a Clapton bodyguard; Colin
Smythe of London, one of Clapton's tour managers, and pilot Jeff
Brown of East Chicago, Ind.
   Vaughan, 35, who overcame a 1986 drug problem to win two Grammy
awards and the musician of the decade honors in his home state of
Texas, gained popularity in the middle 1980s with his guitar
jamming and blues sound, borrowed much from music legends B.B.
King, Muddy Waters and Albert King.
   B.B. King said he was ``saddened beyond words'' after learning
of Vaughan's death.
   ``Stevie Ray Vaughan was like one of my children, and I felt a
great loss when I heard the news,'' B.B. King said in a statement.
``The loss is a great loss for blues music and all fans of music
around the world. He was just beginning to be appreciated and
develop his potential.''
   Chicago blues guitarist Buddy Guy, a longtime friend of Vaughan
who had participated in Sunday night's concert, choked back tears
after learning about the crash.
   ``He was one of the greatest I ever met,'' Guy said. ``My head
ain't right yet.''
   ``This is the worst accident to happen to Texas music since
Buddy Holly and the Big Bopper went down in the '50s,'' said Casey
Monahan, director of the Texas Music Office in Austin, where
Vaughan got his musical start. ``It's a hole no one can fill.''
   Andy Schwartz, a spokesman for Epic Records in New York, which
owns Vaughan's label, said Vaughan had toured this summer with
blues singer Joe Cocker and was to release a new record in
September with his brother, Jimmie.
   Jimmie Vaughan had been at the weekend concert, Schwartz said.
   ``They were really looking forward to the release of the record,
had completed some video and were having some discussion about
touring as the Vaughan brothers,'' Schwartz said.
   Vaughan had a platinum album with his band Double Trouble in
``Couldn't Stand the Weather,'' released in 1984. That same year,
he won a Grammy Award for best traditional blues recording for a
song called ``Texas Flood.''
   This year, he won a Grammy in the contemporary blues category
for ``In Step.''
   Guitar Player Magazine cited Vaughan as the best electric blues
player in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1988, finally naming him to
its ``Gallery of the Greats'' in 1989. He also was named this
spring as musician of the decade by the South by Southwest Music
and Media Conference in Austin, Texas.
   Bill Bruce, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator,
said the Bell Jet Ranger helicopter slammed into the hill in dense
fog, but it was not certain if weather contributed to the accident.
   ``It was a high energy impact at a shallow angle,'' Bruce said.
   The victims apparently died upon impact, authorities said.
   Dominic Scaffidi, a National Weather Service forecaster at
Sullivan, said fog had reduced visibility overnight to below two
miles in parts of southern Wisconsin, a condition requiring pilots
to fly by instruments rather than sight.
   Deputies found the wreckage about 7 a.m.
   The other victims included Nigel Browne, a Clapton bodyguard;
and Colin Smythe, one of Clapton's tour managers, Clapton's
statement said.
   The pilot was identified as Jeff Brown by Walworth County
Coroner John Griebel.

<TEXT>
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa broke off talks
Monday with Indians involved in a seven-week armed standoff with
authorities and ordered the army to tear down Mohawk barricades in
two Quebec communities.
   The premier said the Mohawks had not been negotiating in good
faith, and he was therefore obliged to assume his responsibility
for public order.
   ``I have asked the Canadian army to continue its mission, to
take down the barricades,'' Bourassa told a news conference in
Montreal, broadcast live on Canadian television. ``And I hope in
the coming days we will have a resolution to this crisis.''
   At Bourassa's request, troops a week ago replaced Quebec
provincial police at the barricades in the communities of Oka and
Chateauguay.
   Gen. John de Chastelain, chief of staff of the Canadian Forces,
did not say how or when the army would move, but indicated it would
be soon.
   ``We have been told to take down the barricades, we're going to
take down the barricades,'' the general told reporters later
Monday. ``We hope somebody will take them down for us.''
   He said the best way would be if the Mohawks simply abandoned
their positions and allowed the army to move in and simply cart
away the pieces.
   Mohawk negotiators could not be reached immediately for comment
on Bourassa's decision.
   But Georges Erasmus, national chief of the Assembly of First
Nations, a nationwide grouping of Indian bands, said: ``He's
declared war on the Mohawks.''
   Erasmus insisted that the Mohawks wanted a negotiated
settlement. ``That's the only thing that's going to avoid
bloodshed.''
   A reporter for Canadian television reported from the scene at
Oka, where the Indian troubles began, that armed Mohawk men
appeared to have withdrawn from the barricades, leaving only women
and children.
   Part of the problem with the negotiations has to do with the
confused nature of Mohawk politics. Various groups vie for
leadership on the numerous reserves. Some claim the militant
Warrior society has usurped authority from elected native officials.
   ``We Quebeckers and Canadians cannot tolerate groups of citizens
living in Quebec choosing which laws they want to respect and which
they want to ignore,'' Bourassa told the news conference.
   Mohawks from the Kahnesatake reserve at Oka, 18 miles west of
Montreal, set up a barricade across the main road into the reserve
to protest the town's plan to expand a golf course onto territory
claimed by the Indians.
   On July 11, provincial police attempted to storm the barricade,
but were repulsed. A policeman was shot dead in the attempt,
although it was not clear who killed him.
   After the police action, Mohawks from the Kahnawake reserve
south of Montreal set up a sympathy blockade at Chateauguay,
cutting off the Mercier Bridge across the St. Lawrence River
linking Montreal's southern suburbs with the city.
   That blockade caused a major disruption of traffic, forcing many
people to make long detours. It also led to rising tempers among
local residents, against both the police and the Indians.
   The issue of the golf course was resolved early on when the
federal government agreed to buy the land and turn it over to the
natives. But since then, the Mohawks have used the situation to air
a much wider series of demands, including sovereignty.
   Bernard Roy, the federal government's negotiator, spoke to
reporters two hours before Bourassa, saying the Mohawks must
moderate their demands.
   He said the Mohawk demand for immunity from prosecution for
those involved in the July 11 shootout was unacceptable.
   The Mohawks had agreed, in what they called a gesture of good
faith, to open one lane of the Mercier bridge to traffic. That was
rejected by Bourassa, who termed the offer not serious.

<HEAD>Two Bombs Explode in Latest Attacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blast on Monday damaged a factory
owned by the family of the trade secretary, whose commercial
holdings have been a target of suspected renegades, police said.
   Another bomb exploded before dawn Tuesday outside a car dealer
in the financial district of Makati, police said. Windows of the
building were shattered, but there were no injuries, police said.
   The incident Tuesday, the 17th explosion in two weeks, occurred
on the third year anniversary of the Aug. 28, 1987 failed coup
against President Corazon Aquino.
   The blasts, blamed on rebel soldiers, have gone off despite
military and police checkpoints in the capital. Military leaders
have warned that the spate of explosions may precede a coup attempt.
   Mrs. Aquino meanwhile urged village leaders to fight the
``psychological terror'' spread by the rebels.
   ``At this point their main strategy is to sow psychological
terror in the minds of our people through constant lies,
misinformation and destructive rumor-mongering,'' Mrs. Aquino said
in an address to village leaders Monday. She asked them to ``fight
these lies and rumors.''
   At the armed forces headquarters in suburban Quezon city,
statements purportedly coming from dissidents were circulated
Monday on the eve of the August coup, which almost toppled Mrs.
Aquino and left at least 50 people dead.
   It called Mrs. Aquino to resign or ``face the wrath of the
nation.''
   Monday's bombing at the Republic Flour Mills was the fourth
blast at firms owned by the family of Trade Secretary Jose
Concepcion. The most serious bombing occurred Friday at
Concepcion's soft drink company on the outskirts of Manila. Three
workers were wounded.
   There have been six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino since she
was swept to power in a 1985 civilian-military coup that toppled
President Ferdinand Marcos.

<HEAD>U.N. Chief Says He Will Insist That Iraq Respect U.N. Resolutions</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday he will insist that Iraq respect Security Council
resolutions demanding the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait
and the release of all foreigners.
   Perez de Cuellar is scheduled to meet with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz on Thursday in Amman, Jordan, in an effort to
negotiate an end to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Since Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ordered his troops into
Kuwait on Aug. 2, the U.N. Security Council has passed five
resolutions condemning Iraq.
   The resolutions have demanded the immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait, imposed a trade embargo,
declared the annexation of Kuwait null and void, insisted that Iraq
allow all foreigners to leave, and authorized military action to
enforce the economic sanctions against Baghdad.
   ``Now is the time for diplomacy in order to obtain full
implementation of the Security Council resolutions,'' Perez de
Cuellar told reporters.
   ``The Security Council is not a negotiator, it is a body that
adopts resolutions which are laws for the international community.
The secretary-general has to be a negotiator. That is why I am now
going to the area to see the ways and means of having the
resolutions implemented,'' he said.
   The U.N. chief said it ``is my hope'' that Iraq is seeking a
negotiated end to the crisis.
   Perez de Cuellar held a series of private meetings Monday with
senior diplomats regarding his mission, including the U.S., Soviet,
French, British and Chinese ambassadors; the Kuwaiti ambassador;
and the whole Security Council, after which he met reporters.
   Perez de Cuellar said he was open to discussion on the blockade
of food and medicine shipments to Iraq under the U.N. trade
embargo. The Security Council resolution allows shipments of such
goods in certain humanitarian cases.
   Asked whether he was bothered that the embargo is preventing
food and medicine from reaching the Iraqi public, Perez de Cuellar
replied: ``That is a question which is, as well, one of the
subjects I am going to discuss with the Iraqis.''
   But Perez de Cuellar insisted that he would always bear in mind
the five resolutions passed by the Security Council in his talks
with Iraqi officials.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush told a news conference
that if Perez de Cuellar could make progress in getting the Iraqis
out of Kuwait, ``so much the better.''
   But he said Saddam's resistance to comply with international law
leaves little hope for ``fruitful negotiation'' in the
U.N.-sponsored search for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis.
   The president said it was inconceivable that Perez de Cuellar
will make concessions to Iraq.
   ``The United Nations' position is not negotiable,'' Bush said.
``There is no room for compromise on getting the legitimate
government (of Kuwait) back and the illegitimate invaders out.''
   Perez de Cuellar said he had not yet heard from Bush on his
mission, but added: ``I am persuaded personally that President Bush
will not undermine my efforts.''
   Saddam has invited Perez de Cuellar to come to Baghdad, but the
U.N. chief said he has no plans for now to visit Iraq. He did not
explicitly explain why, saying only that he thought it was
important for him to meet Aziz in Jordan.
   Asked to assess the prospects for the talks, Perez de Cuellar
later told NBC News: ``I am hopeful, and I think that widsom will
prevail.''

<HEAD>Statue of Lenin in Downtown Tbilisi Finally Felled by Activists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people watched as a giant statue of
Vladimir Lenin was toppled with official approval early Tuesday in
the Georgian capital of Tbilisi, a local editor reported.
   The statue of the founder of the Soviet state had become a
target of anti-Communist activists in the Caucasian republic months
ago, and police had guarded it against threats to destroy it.
During a meeting of the Georgia Supreme Soviet on March 18,
demonstrators hurled cans of red-brown paint at Lenin, marring the
statue and its pedestal.
   Zurab Kodalashvili, editor of the independent Georgian agency
Novosti Iberia, said authorities gave in to public demands and
agreed to permit dismantling of the monument.
   The huge stone monument that dominated the downtown square in
front of City Hall was toppled shortly after midnight with about
350 people standing by, Kodalashvili said.
   The editor told The Associated Press by telephone from Tbilisi
that the square filled with people during the night as unidentified
workers labored for more than five hours to bring down the statue.
   Similar statues, ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union, have
been destroyed in more than two dozen Georgian towns in recent
months, and another was toppled recently in a Lithuanian town.
   Criticism of the Communist revolutionary has surfaced in recent
months, but for most of the past seven decades, Lenin's name and
memory have been sacrosanct.
   One official exception took place at the the Moscow City
Council, where radical reformers who won election earlier this year
voted to remove Lenin's bust from their chambers.

<HEAD>Coffee Maker Tells Frustrated Consumers to Keep Calling Recall
Number</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A manufacturer's announcement last week that
it was recalling one of its coffee makers has led to a flood of
calls that have tied up a toll-free number and brought some
consumers to a fast boil.
   ``We know there is a large volume of calls we're missing,'' said
Jerry Ray, spokesman for Proctor-Silex Co. of Richmond, Va.
   Ray said the company processed 75,000 calls in the first four
days after it pledged to provide free coffee makers to an estimated
800,000 consumers who purchased a model now declared a fire hazard.
   Proctor-Silex said the coffee makers are subject to potentially
dangerous overheating because their thermostats and thermal fuses
may malfunction.
   Consumers have complained to news organizations that they spent
hours unsuccessfully trying to get through to the toll free number,
or that they were connected to the wrong number.
   Amy Paulman, public affairs officer for the Consumer Product
Safety Commission, said it was not unusual for telephone lines to
be jammed the first few days after a recall is announced.
   Ray said the company has 200 trained phone operators answering
queries 24 hours a day. He urged people to call at night when the
line is not so busy, and to keep trying.
   Ray, however, said telephone company officials have assured
Proctor-Silex that there is no problem with phone connections. He
said some radio stations broadcast the wrong number and many
consumers were simply misdialing.
   The correct number is 1-800-341-3333.
   Ray said about 80 percent of the people calling have A6 models
that are not subject to the recall. The recalled models were made
in 1985 and 1986, begin with A4 or A5 and have series number that
end with the numbers 58 or 68.
   Calls are even received from people who own rival brand coffee
makers, Ray said. ``We get calls from people who own everything.''
   The phone service will be open several months, he said, and
``We're glad people are trying to call. We're trying to get the
coffee makers out of the kitchen.''

   Ten of 11 OPEC ministers tentatively
agreed early Tuesday to permit increased oil production immediately
by some countries in response to the Persian Gulf crisis, sources
said.
   Iran was lone holdout at an informal meeting of 11 of the 13
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity. Iraq and Libya did not attend.
   OPEC officials planned to try to persuade Iran to join the
arrangement, which would lift the cartel's quotas temporarily to
permit increased production by countries with additional production
capability.
   The ministers were expected to meet Tuesday to endorse the plan.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have said they intend to pump more
oil to help make up for the shortfall of 4 million barrels a day
caused by the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. U.N.
sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The officials were trying to come up with an ``understanding''
that would sanction output increases by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
others to help offset losses to the world market caused by the
crisis, said senior delegate sources.
   ``Most countries have already agreed to sanction production
increases for the simple reason that . . . (the countries) are
going to do it anyway,'' said one source.
   ``If they do it outside OPEC, it may be difficult to have them
back in the mold again.''
   A source close to OPEC said it appeared Saudi Arabia, the
world's largest crude exporter, has already increased oil
production to meet the extra demand. But he refused to give details.
   Figures obtained Monday from the U.S. Energy Information
Administration estimate Saudi Arabia's production at 6 million
barrels of oil per day, 600,000 more than its OPEC quota of 5.4
million barrels.
   In Venezuela, the government said a 90-hour shutdown of one of
its oil installations began Monday as that country prepared to
increase production.
   A subsidiary of the state oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela
shut down a site to increase production capacity there from 180,000
barrels per day to 220,000 barrels per day, the government news
agency Venpres said.
   Venezuela's OPEC quota is 1.95 million barrels a day. Quotas
were set last month under a production accord worked out by the 13
producer nations. That agreement sets an overall output ceiling of
22.5 million barrels a day in the last half of the year.
   Iran has fought lifting the quotas. Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh, taking a break from closed-door discussions,
said Monday ``it is not necessary'' now to boost output, ``but
maybe in the future.''
   Iran says enough excess oil is stored in the industrialized
world to make up for any shortages.
   Libyan officials were also expected to argue against any move to
raise production. A Libyan delegation may arrive Tuesday for the
consultations with OPEC President Sadek Boussena, the Algerian oil
minister, sources said.
   Resentment has surfaced at what some nations view as political
pressure on the group from the United States, the world's largest
oil importer, to lift production.
   Delegate sources said some countries received calls from
American officials before the meeting asking questions about their
positions.
   ``We cannot be pressured,'' said one source, demanding anonymity.
   Any arrangement to permit higher pumping would likely include
promises that production be reduced once the crisis ends, according
to the sources.
   It also would probably call on consuming nations to take steps
to use oil in storage to help meet any shortages, they said.
   Another source suggested the talks might end with those nations
wanting to boost output issuing a statement on their own, without
the cartel's backing.
   There also seemed to be some support for a solution that would
not require a formal statement _ or even a formal meeting.
   Crude prices surged last week above $30 a barrel on fears of
military escalation and a shortage of crude supplies in the
oil-rich gulf region. But they plummeted Monday, with a barrel of
light sweet crude for October delivery dropped $4 to close at
$26.91 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The OPEC nations are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Agreement Gives Blacks, Whites Equal Power on School Board</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black and white leaders trying to end eight
months of racial protests over the public schools agreed Monday on
a plan to share power on the school board.
   The agreement worked out over the weekend was approved by the
City Council and school board members of both races, said Mayor Joe
Smitherman. The plan would give each race an equal vote, and the
chairmanship would alternate between black and white.
   Smitherman and council members reached the agreement in meetings
Sunday with two dozen black leaders.
   ``I think we've got something good worked out,'' said
Smitherman, who is white.
   Black protesters weren't directly involved in the talks, Sanders
said.
   The trouble began in December, when the five blacks on the
11-member school board walked out over a decision against rehiring
Norward Roussell, the public school system's first black
superintendent.
   Daily protests, lawsuits, school boycotts, sit-ins and several
altercations with police followed. Roussell resigned in May, about
two months before his contract expired, and settled a $10 million
lawsuit against the school board for $150,000.
   State Sen. Hank Sanders, a Selma attorney and leader of the
protests, said Monday that protesters and City Attorney Henry Pitts
were working toward an end to pending litigation. He refused to
release details.
   The city filed misdemeanor charges against several protesters,
including Sanders' wife, Rose, and the protesters in turn filed a
$10 billion lawsuit challenging the City Council's appointment of
school board members.
   Sanders has said the suit would be dropped and the protests
would stop if the charges were dismissed.
   Selma schools reopened Aug. 20, with blacks making up 80 percent
of the student body of about 5,800.
   The agreement worked out over the weekend was approved by the
City Council and black and white members of the school board,
Smitherman said. Under the plan, five white and five black board
members vote on all issues and chairman Carl Barker would vote only
on litigation matters.
   The City Council promised to keep a racial balance on future
boards and to appoint a black as board chairman when Barker
eventually steps down. The chairmanship would alternate between
blacks and whites.
   ``People have asked me how the board can operate with a
five-and-five split,'' Smitherman said Monday. ``Well, you're going
to operate with the art of compromise.''
   The full board is to meet Sept. 13. The white members of the
board have continued to meet throughout the walkout.
   Sanders said the agreement doesn't give blacks equal power
because Barker would control committee appointments and could vote
on legal matters.
   The rotation would be fair, ``but that may not come about under
this present agreement for several years,'' he said.
   ``The long and short of it is that at this point the protests
would continue and the litigation would continue,'' Sanders said.
``The black (school) board members would be back but that would be
all.''

<HEAD>Gambling Emerges as Major Issue in Tuesday's Alaska Primary</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to ADD how gambling initiative relates to
governor's race. Pick up 8th graf pvs, `Jim Campell...</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Differences over a gambling initiative
were at the center of a close race for governor between Lt. Gov.
Stephen McAlpine and former Anchorage Mayor Tony Knowles going into
Tuesday's Democratic primary.
   In the Republican race, state Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski was
heavily favored to win her second consecutive nomination.
   In Oklahoma, Gov. Henry Bellmon, a Republican, opened the door
for a wide-open race when he announced he would not seek
re-election, and five candidates in each party sought the
nomination for his job in Tuesday's primaries.
   Alaskans were expected to reject an initiative that would allow
local-option casino gambling. There was virtually no campaign for
the measure, and a poll last week found voters opposing it by
2-to-1.
   Gov. Steve Cowper, a Democrat, helped lead the campaign against
the gambling measure.
   Knowles, who opposes the measure, seized on the issue in the
campaign's final weeks after McAlpine said he would vote for the
initiative. McAlpine said he opposes casino gambling but supports
letting local voters decide.
   McAlpine tried to paint Knowles as soft on drugs because of the
former mayor's opposition to a measure on the November general
election ballot that would restore criminal penalties for
possessing small amounts of marijuana. Alaska is the only state
that has no criminal penalties for possessing less than 4 ounces of
marijuana at home.
   Knowles said he opposes the measure because it would allow jail
terms for first-time offenders.
   In the Republican race Sturgulewski maintained a healthy lead in
the polls in her second bid to become Alaska's first woman
governor. She lost the 1986 race to Cowper, who is not seeking a
second term.
   Jim Campbell, a former chairman of the Alaska Railroad Corp.,
advanced in the polls in recent weeks but still remained well
behind Sturgulewski. In third place was state Sen. Rick Halford,
who appealed to conservative, anti-government voters.
   In congressional races, Rep. Don Young and Sen. Ted Stevens were
expected to win the GOP nominations easily. Young had token
opposition from Gary Sinkola, of Fairbanks, and Stevens faced Bob
Bird, a teacher from Kenai and anti-abortion activist.
   On the Democratic, former Valdez mayor John Devens was the only
candidate to oppose Young. Seeking the nomination for Stevens' seat
were Tom Taggart of Hyder and Michael Beasley of Eagle River.
   Alaska is one of three states with an open primary in which all
candidates appear on one ballot regardless of party. Voters are
free to vote in one party in one race and another party in another
race.
   In Oklahoma's Republican gubernatorial primary, four candidates
said they had a real shot at the anticipated Sept. 18 runoff. They
were Oklahoma City attorney Burns Hargis, former U.S. Attorney Bill
Price, restaurateur and former television newsman Vince Orza and
truck stop operator Jerry Brown. The other candidate was Caddo
rancher and political newcomer Jerry Hoyt.
   In the Democratic primary, U.S. Rep. Wes Watkins battled with
Oklahoma City businessman David Walters, who ran unsuccessfully
against Bellmon in 1986, and House Speaker Steve Lewis. The other
candidates were John Shorty Barnett and Anne Hartin Langston.
   Even a pillow came into dispute in the heated campaign.
   Walters chaged that Watkins set on a pillow during a televised
debate among all the Democratic nominees in an effort to make
himself look taller.
   ``Now that's the vintage Wes Watkins. Even while he's supposed
to be debating the issues in front of the people, he uses a prop to
make himself appear to be something he's not,'' Walters said.
   Watkins replied he was ``shocked that Mr. Walters is so
sensitive about his height'' and said the pillow was to ease his
back.
   ``I offered to help him (Walters) raise his chair, but he
declined,'' Watkins said.
   U.S. Sen. David Boren faced two candidates in the Democratic
primary _ newcomer Manuel Ybarra and perennial candidate Virginia
Jenner. The winner will face the sole GOP candidate, lawyer Stephen
Jones.

<TEXT>
   At least four radio stations took Sinead
O'Connor off the air after the Irish singer offended patriotic
listeners by banning ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' from her concert.
   Anti-O'Connor backlash tied up radio switchboards in New York
and New Jersey, but apparently didn't ripple beyond the region.
   O'Connor's hits include ``Nothing Compares 2 U'' and
``Mandinka.''
   During the peak morning drive time Monday, radio show hosts
smashed O'Connor's records on the air.
   Listeners were incensed that the singer-songwriter, known for
her confessional lyrics and shaved head, threatened to walk out of
the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel Friday night if the
national anthem was played, as it routinely is at the amphitheater.
   Mike Opelka, producer of the morning show at WHTZ in Newark,
said the station got about 1,200 unsolicited calls between 7 a.m.
and 10 a.m. By a margin of 30-1, callers wanted O'Connor off the
air.
   The ban will likely be short-lived, said program director Steve
Kingston.
   ``It's a statement based on the feelings of our audience,''
Kingston said. ``Tomorrow, when people forget about it, we'll
probably go back to playing her record.''
   WPLJ in New York, WHTG in Eatontown, and WDHA in Dover, N.J.,
also stopped playing O'Connor songs, including singles from her hit
album ``I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got.''
   In a news release Monday, O'Connor said she hadn't meant to
insult anyone, but objects to any national anthem being played at
her concerts, ``even my own.''
   The New Jersey center gave in to the singer's demand, fearing
that a last-minute cancellation would enrage the audience of 9,000,
but prohibited any future appearances.
   Directors of rock stations in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and
San Diego said they hadn't heard of the controversy.
   Meanwhile, Armed Forces Radio said soldiers and their families
overseas would continue to hear O'Connor.
   ``Our position for music is, if it's a song that is popular and
goes up the charts with various audiences in the U.S., that's where
we play our music from,'' said spokesman Jim Kout. ``We don't ban
artists. The only time we wouldn't carry a song would be when a
judge declared it obscene.''
   A New York state senator was less forgiving.
   Nicholas Spano, a Westchester County Republican, urged fans to
boycott O'Connor's performance Wednesday in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
   ``He's pathetic,'' responded O'Connor's publicist, Elaine Schock.
   ``Politicians will jump on anything, won't they?'' Schock said.
``I'm surprised he believes in censorship because Americans believe
so strongly in freedom of speech. He should be ashamed.''

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson is headed to Baghdad to
interview Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for the syndicated television
show ``Inside Edition,'' a spokeswoman for the show said Monday.
   Jackson, whose own ``The Jesse Jackson Show'' is to premiere
next month, was scheduled to leave Monday night for Jordan with a
15-member group. From there, they planned to travel to Iraq and
interview Saddam on Wednesday or Thursday, said the spokeswoman,
Allyson Kossow.
   Iraq has issued visas, she said.
   She said no date had been set yet for the broadcast of Jackson's
interview with Saddam, whose Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait touched off
the Persian Gulf crisis, which has brought thousands of U.S.
soldiers to Saudi Arabia.
   Kossow said Jackson isn't being paid for the interview, nor will
the interview appear on Jackson's own show, which is syndicated by
Warner Bros. in Los Angeles.
   ``Inside Edition,'' which is syndicated by competing King World
Productions, will pay for the travel and production expenses of
Jackson's group, and ``we retain complete editorial control'' of
interviews, Kossow said.
   No spokesperson for Jackson's talk show was immediately
available for comment.
   Jackson, who in 1984 played a role as an unofficial diplomat in
seeking the release of a U.S. Navy pilot shot down and held in
Syria, told a news conference last week he was trying to arrange a
trip to Iraq.
   He said his goal was to interview Iraqi officials and American
hostages in Baghdad for his new series, but not to go there as
anything other than a journalist.
   ``It would not be appropriate to go there as a diplomat,'' he
said then.
   Jackson's party includes former ABC correspondent Ken Walker,
Kossow said.

   The killings of three women students on
the eve of fall classes in this college town left other students
fearful, parents worried and police trying to match clues at two
off-campus apartments.
   The body of an 18-year-old Santa Fe Community College student
was found in her apartment early Monday, about eight hours after
police found two University of Florida freshman slain in their
southwest Gainesville apartment less than two miles away.
   Investigators believed the killings were linked, said
Gainesville Police Chief Wayland Clifton.
   One of the victims was found nude and one was partly nude,
police said. They refused to give details on the third victim or
say how the three were killed.
   ``We're looking at a number of leads, a lot of evidence but we
can't say we have a definite suspect in mind,'' Clifton said. He
didn't explain how the two attacks were linked.
   The first two bodies were discovered Sunday afternoon after the
parents of a Jacksonville student, unable to reach their daughter,
had police and a maintenance man open the door, police said.
   The slayings prompted a flood of telephone calls to police and
the university, where classes began Monday.
   ``We're receiving calls from all over, particularly from
out-of-state parents,'' said Lt. Sadie Darnell, spokeswoman for the
Gainesville Police Department.
   ``We don't want to create panic, but people need to be cautious
about who they let into their apartments and who they let into
their cars,'' she said.
   University of Florida spokeswoman Linda Gray said the university
also was besieged by frantic calls. President John Lombardi and
other officials spent Monday morning trying to ease the fears of
anxious parents.
   The university, which advised students to make reassuring calls
home, has established a free phone bank.
   ``My parents were calling all weekend and they couldn't get me
because I was out. My father was a basket case,'' said Lainie Gold,
20, a University of Florida junior from North Miami. ``Everyone
I've talked to is very nervous.''
   ``I made sure all my doors and windows were locked,'' said
Christie Torchia, 21, a junior from Coral Springs.
   The killings revived memories of Tiffany Sessions, a 20-year-old
UF student who vanished Feb. 9, 1989, after leaving her Gainesville
apartment to go jogging. Despite a massive search, no trace of her
has been found.
   The students killed in the same apartment were identified by
Gainesville police as Christina P. Powell, 17, of Jacksonville, and
Sonya Larson, 18, of Deerfield Beach. Both were second-semester
freshmen who had gone to summer school at the University of Florida.
   The third victim was Christa L. Hoyt, 18, a student at nearby
Santa Fe Community College and a full-time records clerk at the
Alachua County Sheriff's Office, the college's president, Lawrence
Tyree said Monday.
   University spokeswoman Linda Gray said that more than 75 percent
of the university's 34,000 students live off campus, many in
apartments.
   ``This is such a tragic way for this school year to begin,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Military Police Headquarters Destroyed by Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fire on Monday destroyed the
headquarters of the military police. It came during a 3-week-old
strike by state police over the killing of an officer allegedly by
military police.
   No injuries were reported in the fire.
   Military Police Commander Ivan Granoogst said there was no
immediate indication that the fire was linked to the police strike.
He said investigators have not excluded arson.
   The two-story 18th-century brick building is inside the Fort
Zeelandia military compound in Paramaribo and normally heavily
guarded.
   Military police said the fire broke out at 2 a.m. in a food
storage room and burned for two hours, destroying the building.
Only the walls remained standing.
   The building was constructed in 1890 and was considered an
important historical landmark in the capital of this nation on the
northern coast of South America.
   The state police allege that the military police killed police
officer Herman Gooding on Aug. 4. They claim the killing was in
retaliation for the arrest in a nightclub the previous day of a
military policeman who was shot in the leg while resisting arrest.
   The state police went on strike after Gooding's slaying.
   Two weeks ago, the government named a special committee to
oversee an investigation into the police killing.
   However, the state police continued their strike and no
policemen can be seen patrolling the streets.
   They have, however, returned to administrative duties and are
investigating crimes such as murder, manslaughter and larceny.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A parliamentary committee that intends
to investigate a grave containing 10 bodies _ including two men who
reportedly had been arrested by the army _ has summoned army chief
Gen. Humberto Ortega to testify.
   Parliamentarian Frank Duarte, chairman of the Human Rights
Commission, told the pro-government newspaper La Prensa that he
issued the summons Monday after a human rights activist claimed the
army had ignored her demands for an investigation.
   Peasants found the grave, which included the body of a child, in
mid-June near a former military base, near the town of Wiwili, 175
miles from Managua. That area had been in the heart of the war zone
during the war in the 1980s between U.S.-backed Contra rebels and
troops of the Sandinista government, which was voted out of power
this year.
   Two women who viewed the bodies said they recognized clothing
and other personal articles belonging to their sons, both
draft-dodgers who disappeared in October 1983 after being arrested
by the Sandinista army.
   The civil war ended after Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took
office April 25. La Prensa belongs to Mrs. Chamorro's family.
   Ortega led the army during the rule of his brother _ former
President Daniel Ortega _ and was retained as army chief by Mrs.
Chamorro.
   The newspaper did not give details of the pending investigation
by the National Assembly committee. The date for the start of
hearings has not been made public.
   Lt. Col. Rosa Pasos, the army spokeswoman, was out of her office
and was not immediately available for comment, an aide said.
   Duarte said he was acting on a complaint by Marta Patricia
Baltodano of the Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights.

<HEAD>Demonstrators Again On Central Square</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 anti-government
demonstrators gathered in a central square in Bucharest for the
sixth straight day Monday, demanding the resignation of President
Ion Iliescu.
   Police stationed in the area of University Square prevented the
protesters from disrupting traffic at the main intersection on the
capital's fashionable Balcescu Boulevard. Bucharest residents
opposed to the protesters' actions also intervened.
   There were several skirmishes between protesters and bystanders,
and one man appeared to be badly beaten.
   The rallies _ motivated by the deteriorating state of the
economy _ began Wednesday evening and escalated to violent
confrontations with police at the weekend in which 80 people were
detained.
   On Saturday night, a clash erupted after police moved in, armed
with clubs and shields. At least two people were reported
hospitalized. About 300 protesters occupied the square Sunday.
   Monday's protesters, numbering about 100, again chanted slogans
demanding Iliescu's resignation.
   Critics accuse Iliescu and his associates, who won free
elections earlier this year, of keeping many of the policies of
ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausecu.
   The University Square was the site of a 53-day anti-government
demonstration and traffic blockade earlier this year that sparked
several days of violence in the capital.
   In a separate development Monday, labor leaders at the important
Tractorul factory in the central city of Brasov declared a general
strike, media reported. The union there has demanded higher pay and
improved work conditions.
   They said they would not return to work until Prime Minister
Petre Roman came to negotiate.
   The government issued a statement rejecting the demands and
charging the action was costing the economy $1 million daily.

<TEXT>
   More crews were mobilized Monday as the wind
picked up again, whipping a 3,000-acre fire that killed two
firefighters and destroyed 19 homes outside this northern Utah
mountain community.
   The fire, of unknown origin, exploded across 2,500 acres and
through several canyons with the help of 40 mph wind Sunday,
burning to within a half-mile of Midway, a community of 1,200.
   About 200 firefighters worked Monday to build containment lines
around the stubborn blaze 30 miles east of Salt Lake City. At dusk,
the crew was cut in half to give exhausted firefighters a chance to
rest. The remaining crew should be able to handle the fire
overnight as temperatures cooled and winds died down, said Dick
Buehler, deputy incident commander.
   Uinta National Forest spokeswoman Vicki May said a fire line had
been partially completed along the fire's northeastern perimeter,
and air tankers made passes over the northwestern corner to aid
ground crews in snuffing stubborn hot spots.
   But while crews made against the blaze during the morning, wind
out of the south picked up early in the afternoon, pushing flames
northward through oak brush and pine trees left tinder-dry by
drought.
   About 300 homes were evacuated in the fire's path.
   Uinta spokesman Bevan Killpack said the two dead firefighters
were working on a ridge late Sunday, trying to build a fire line
with a bulldozer, when flames ``blew up (and) confused them.'' The
pair apparently were overcome by smoke, although their bodies were
severely burned when they were found.
   ``The wind must have changed and got them disoriented with the
smoke and trapped them in there,'' Killpack said.
   The victims were identified as Wasatch County Sheriff's Deputy
Blake Wright, 39, of Heber City, and Ralph Broadhead, 65, a county
public works employee.
   Sheriff Edd Thacker said the two were trapped between the fire
and a cliff and cleared wood and brush away with a bulldozer in a
vain attempt to avoid the flames.
   ``They did what they were supposed to do. They tried what they
knew how, but it was a firestorm,'' he said. ``Investigators
estimate that 1,100-degree temperatures went through there. That's
like a blowtorch.''
   Gov. Norm Bangerter, who flew over the fire area late Monday
morning, offered his sympathy to the victims' families.
   Atop Faucett Canyon, Dale Jablonski, area forester for State
Lands and Forestry, supervised firefighters cutting a line between
the blaze and a nearby cabin Monday.
   ``What we're trying to do now is get a safety zone where we can
make a stand, and if the fire makes a run at us, we can get out,''
he said, watching his crew and a bulldozer clear away trees and
brush.
   In Midway, about 100 people gathered outside the town hall to
watch the fire and look over a map of the area. Most were cabin
owners trying to figure out if their summer homes lay in the fire's
path.
   ``I'm a homeowner, well, I guess lot owner now,'' lamented Louis
Cardon, whose $150,000 cabin in the Devil's Hole area was one of
the first to be gutted by flames.
   Norval Lambert was waiting to hear whether his cabin in Lime
Canyon was safe. The fire was just one ridge away from his home, he
said.
   Lambert said his cabin, which he began building in 1971, was
filled with antiques. ``There's some stuff there I just can't
replace. You can't put a value on it.''
   The firefighting force included crews from the U.S. Forest
Service, the state, the National Park Service, Wasatch County, Utah
State Prison and the cities of Provo, Orem, Lehi, Pleasant Grove
and American Fork.

<HEAD>`Open' Saudi Coverage Leads to Disbanded Press Pool</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon disbanded its Persian Gulf news
media pool Aug. 26, saying it is not needed because open coverage
is now being permitted.
   ``The decision by the government of Saudi Arabia to allow
reporters from the U.S. and other countries to cover the military
operation in the Gulf region makes it unnecessary to continue the
National Media Pool,'' the Defense Department said.
   The 17-member pool had been filing press and broadcast reports
and transmitting still photographs daily since its arrival in Saudi
Arabia Aug. 13.
   The decision came four days after President Bush and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said they would welcome freer media access to
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. At that time they said it would be up
to the Saudis to allow it.
   Bush and Cheney were questioned after reports that the Saudis
were beginning to restrict media coverage and considering whether
to order most foreign journalists out of the country.
   Eleven major news organizations expressed concern about
reporting restrictions in Saudi Arabia in a letter Aug. 22 to Bush.
   The media said ``minimum access'' had been available through the
Defense Department pool and extremely limited unilateral
representation, with more severe limitations in the offing.
   ``We respectfully request that the administration do everything
in its power to gain full media access to Saudi Arabia and to the
American presence there,'' the groups said. ``Perhaps accreditation
through the American military would be the correct solution.''
   The letter was signed by officials in the Washington bureaus of
ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN; The Associated Press; Time and Newsweek
magazines; and The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The
New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.

<HEAD>American Troops Hungry for News of Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Marine from New York had one
question when he arrived in this desert kingdom: ``Are the Mets in
first?''
   Most of the thousands of U.S. service men and women here have no
access to American publications or any television, so they
incessantly ask visiting reporters about the situation back home.
   ``Do the American people want us here?'' an Army private on a
desert exercise last week wanted to know.
   ``Is President Bush saying we'll go to war?'' asked an Air Force
supply officer.
   A mimeographed newsletter attempts to fill the void with a story
headlined: ``Secretary of Defense Explains Why We Are Here.'' But
it does little to satisfy the appetite of the news-hungry Americans.
   ``The situation is very uncertain,'' Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney says in the newsletter. ``We don't know how long it will
last.''
   However, there were signs the troops will be getting more access
to the news. A daily shipment of newspapers was sent to some camps
last week.
   ``They get passed around and read again and again and again,''
said a spokesman for the 82nd Airborne Division. ``The guys are
hungry for news.''
   A few issues of the military newspaper Stars &amp; Stripes have
turned up, and the small newsletter that carried Cheney's remarks
is being published at one Saudi airbase where U.S. forces are
positioned.
   Iraq is trying to fill the news void with radio broadcasts
suggesting that while Americans are protecting Saudi oil fields the
``petrol emirs'' are in the United States and have ``enjoyed'' the
company of American women.
   ``I thought it was pretty funny, actually,'' said a member of
the 82nd Airborne who listened to the broadcast. ``If that's their
idea of psychological warfare I don't think we have much to worry
about.''
   The Saudi media also has had its fair share of recent propaganda.
   Local television, which can be seen by some U.S. forces staying
in hotels or Saudi barracks, frequently includes lengthy segments
showing the arrival and exercises of troops in the kingdom. There
is no narration, but patriotic music booms.
   Saudi papers carry daily dispatches from a state press agency
designed to assure the public that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
will not affect Saudi Arabia's food supplies, economy or security.
   In the United States, a Chicago cable television company is
producing free 30-second video greetings from family and friends of
soldiers sent to the Mideast.
   Edward K. Conklin, spokesman for Jones' Intercable Inc., said
the military has agreed to broadcast the ``Cable Grams From Home''
to U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf. He said arrangements were being
made to broadcast the greetings to troops on land, too.
   The company will produce the videos this week at its 10 studios
in suburban Chicago, Conklin said.
   ``We know people who have not had the chance to say goodbye to
family and friends,'' Conklin said. ``We had one lady who was
contacted and all she got was a call from a computer that private
so-and-so had been shipped to the Persian Gulf and no other
information was available.''

<HEAD>Attorney General Says Rape Victims' Names Not Confidential</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iowa police must release the names of
most rape victims to the news media, the state attorney general's
office said Aug. 24. Newspaper editors and broadcasters said they
would continue to protect the names.
   In response to a request by Gov. Terry Branstad, assistant
attorney general Gordon Allen said state law does not permit police
to keep the names of rape victims confidential. The only exception
is when release of the name would jeopardize the investigation or
put the victim in danger, he said.
   A spokesman for Branstad said the governor would seek to change
the law to assure confidentiality.
   Allen's opinion was criticized by a victim services counselor,
who said it would make sexual assault victims reluctant to report
crimes.
   The issue came up earlier this year when The Des Moines Register
challenged the practice by Des Moines police of routinely
suppressing names and other information about rape victims. The
department has since released the names, but none has been used in
news stories.

<HEAD>Author Sues New York Times Over Book Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigative reporter angered by The New
York Times' review of his book on the alleged links between
organized crime and the National Football League filed a $10
million libel lawsuit against the paper Aug. 23.
   Dan E. Moldea filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington
over the newspaper's Sept. 3, 1989, review of his book,
``Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional
Football.''
   The newspaper's top attorney expressed confidence the suit would
be thrown out of court and said the review was based ``on accurate
facts.''
   The review by Times sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi said, in part,
that Moldea's book contains ``sloppy journalism'' as well as
``errors and unfounded insinuations.''
   The lawsuit alleges the review ``was intended to protect the NFL
by personally attacking Moldea, discrediting his reputation and
smearing his good name as a careful investigative reporter.''
   ``The review gave false impressions through use of false and
misleading examples intended to injure Moldea's reputation, impeach
Moldea's honesty and integrity and destroyed the likelihood that
`Interference' would become a widely read book by the public,'' the
suit says.
   Moldea said in an interview that his publisher, William Morrow
and Co. Inc., had printed 33,000 copies of the book because initial
sales had been strong. But after the Times' review came out, sales
dropped off precipitously, and only about 21,000 were sold, he said.
   ``This thing could have been stopped so long ago had they just
published a correction or my letter'' that countered, point by
point, statements in the review, Moldea said.
   Eskenazi declined comment on the matter, referring questions to
Times executives ``even though this is something I'm appalled at
when people do it to me.''
   The Times' senior attorney, George Freeman, said he had not seen
the lawsuit, but he was familiar with the case.
   ``We're totally convinced that the suit will be dismissed,''
Freeman said. A book review is ``protected opinion, particularly
where a review is based on accurate facts, as this one is.''

<HEAD>Newspaper Editor Files Countersuit Against Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper editor sued the town of
West Hartford on Aug. 22, claiming the Hartford suburb violated his
rights when it sued him for writing an editorial critical of the
way an anti-abortion protest was handled.
   John Spear, editor of the Orange County Post, a Washingtonville,
N.Y., weekly, claimed in the federal suit that the town tried to
``intimidate, harass, censor and silence a free press'' when it
sued him for alleged racketeering and extortion.
   Spear did not take part in either of two large anti-abortion
protests in West Hartford in 1989. But the town named him in its
June 1989 racketeering lawsuit against anti-abortion activists,
claiming his April 4 editorial, ``Northern Red Necks,'' expressed
support for illegal anti-abortion activities. He was dropped from
the suit in December 1989.
   ``If the freedom of the press means anything, it means that we
can criticize the government harshly. That's what Mr. Spear did,''
Joseph Secola, Spear's attorney, said at a news conference.
   ``They had absolutely no legal basis for suing him,'' Secola
said. ``They viciously abused the legal process.''
   Spears' suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Hartford, seeks
unspecified punitive and compensatory damages.
   Patrick G. Alair, the assistant corporation counsel for West
Hartford, said Spear's involvement in the protest went beyond
writing the editorial. He noted that one of Spear's employees was
arrested in the protest.
   Still, he said, the town dropped Spears from the suit because of
concerns over Spear's First Amendment rights.
   ``We did not want the real issues in the case to be clouded up
with a First Amendment issue,'' Alair said. ``As a legal issue,
(Spear) is a newspaper person. There is an issue of freedom of the
press there.''
   Spear's editorial said anti-abortion protesters at an April 1
demonstration in West Hartford suffered police brutality and were
denied their civil rights.
   The town claimed Spear ``deliberately and maliciously published
an incorrect, defamatory account'' of the protest.
   The town did not allege libel, however. Instead, the town relied
on the racketeering law and claimed Spear's editorial was an
attempt to ``extort a less diligent or softened response from the
West Hartford Police Department to future protest activities.''
   It also said Spear, as editor of the Orange County Post, ``has
actively supported the illegal activities of Operation Rescue
through that medium.''

<HEAD>Judge: Reporter Doesn't Have To Turn Over Notes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A municipal judge ruled Aug. 20 that a
newspaper reporter does not have to turn over to defense attorneys
a set of confidential notes on a murder case.
   ``We have to weigh the tremendous interests of the defendants
against the profound interest of society'' in a free press,
Municipal Court Judge Carol A. Corrigan said.
   Attorneys for three men accused in a 2-year-old murder had
demanded to see the notes of Harry Harris, a crime reporter for The
Tribune.
   In 1988, Harris interviewed a key police informant and wrote a
story based on that discussion; defense attorneys said the notes
contain evidence that could clear their clients.
   But Corrigan ruled that turning over the notes _ which she
viewed after being ordered to do so by a higher court _ would have
``a chilling effect'' on the ability of reporters to interview
confidential sources.
   ``Reporters should take heart from this decision,'' said Tribune
attorney Judith Epstein. ``It is an extraordinarily important
case.''
   The case was the first major test of reporters' rights in
California since earlier this year when the state Supreme Court, in
a case called Delaney vs. Superior Court, weakened protection
afforded reporters by California's Shield Law, Epstein said.
   The Delaney ruling makes it easier for lawyers to demonstrate
that previously protected reporters' notes and other confidential
information may be seized and used in court.

<HEAD>Cincinnati Post Sues Sheriff Over Personnel Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cincinnati Post has asked the Ohio
Supreme Court to order Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis to make
public the personnel records of 20 of his deputies.
   The Post claimed in its suit that Leis violated Ohio's public
records law by denying reporter Molly Kavanaugh access to the
records.
   The suit, filed Aug. 23, also asks the court to hold an
expedited hearing on its request for the records.
   Ms. Kavanaugh, as part of an investigative story about hiring
and employment practices in the sheriff's department, made a
written request to Leis for the records on June 26, according to
the Post's complaint. Ms. Kavanaugh had requested personnel records
of people promoted from the department's corrections division to
its patrol division since Jan. 1, 1989, and 10 other department
employees.
   Leis on July 2 provided the newspaper with a list of people
appointed to the patrol division, but he refused access to any
personnel files, citing confidentiality provisions in two union
contracts.
   The newspaper then sent Leis a letter noting an Ohio Supreme
Court ruling that union contracts do not permit local governments
to deny access to police personnel files that are public record.
Leis responded with a letter saying he was seeking a lawyer's
advice on the issue.
   Frank Weikel, a spokesman for Leis, said the department had no
comment on the suit.

   The Bush administration has vastly overestimated
the viewership of TV Marti, whose broadcasts since March have been
marked by Cuban government jamming, according to a congressional
report Aug. 25.
   The U.S. Information Agency had estimated 1 million to 7 million
Cubans watched the new station, which broadcasts American
entertainment and news shows to the communist-ruled island from
Florida.
   But the General Accounting Office, in an unpublished report
obtained by The Miami Herald, cited notes by U.S. diplomats who
estimated an audience of only 50,000 to 70,000.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, faulted the USIA's
methods in two viewership surveys, which polled Cuban refugees and
emigres arriving at Miami International Airport between March 28
and May 12.
   The survey subjects ``would be more interested in and aware of
TV Marti than the general population'' because they were leaving
Cuba, the GAO said.

<HEAD>Ted Turner Enters New Arena _ Books</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ted Turner is about to take his first step into
the world of book publishing, but he isn't assuming the role of
giant-slayer this time out.
   Turner Publishing Inc. is beginning as a modest venture with
little of the brashness that has accompanied other Turner projects.
Turner's startup of Cable News Network 10 years ago, for instance,
included a prediction that newspapers would die out.
   ``We don't have any intention of becoming a Random House or
Simon &amp; Schuster. Publishing is not the main business of TBS, and
it never will be,'' said Michael Reagan, vice president and
publisher of Turner Publishing.
   Turner Publishing, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting System,
releases its first book, a coffee-table volume of Reagan's
photographs, next month. The book, ``Portrait of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland,'' is tied to a TBS mini-series.
   Most of what follows also will be tied to TBS programming,
especially the company's vast movie library.
   Set for a Valentine's Day release is ``Kisses,'' a photo
collection of silver screen smooches ranging from Clark Gable and
Vivien Leigh in ``Gone With the Wind'' to Groucho Marx and Margaret
Dumont in ``A Night at the Opera.'' TBS will show a one-hour
``Kisses'' special to coincide with thet book's release.
   The publishing company is the latest _ and smallest _ venture of
TBS. Its initial budget is less than $2 million, Reagan said.
   Turner Publishing evolved from the TBS chairman's creation of
the Turner Tomorrow Award, in which a $500,000 prize is offered for
a novel that addresses positive solutions to global problems.
   The award carries a promise to publish the winning manuscript
and, Reagan said, ``it became apparent we'd need a publishing
company.''

   Environmentalists digging in for a new assault
on what they consider sacrosanct energy reserves as threatened oil
shortages and rising gasoline prices spurred by the Persian Gulf
crisis start biting into American pocketbooks.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was only a few days old when Sen.
Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, persuaded colleagues to approve a
measure that would make it easier to expand oil drilling on federal
land, bypassing some environmental restrictions.
   The oil industry was just as quick to call for abandoning recent
curbs on offshore oil drilling, relaxing requirements for cleaner
burning gasoline and drilling in some environmentally sensitive
areas.
   Although neither Murkowski's nor any of the other proposals has
won final congressional approval, environmentalists fear an

   Top priority was given to saving the 300 homes in the Devil's
Hole, Lime Canyon and Snake Creek areas. The homes destroyed were
in Devil's Hole, said Uinta National Park spokeswoman Loyal Clark.
The fire was partly in the park.

   Black and white leaders reached a tentative
agreement to give blacks equal representation on the Selma school
board and end eight months of racial strife, the mayor says.
   ``We're trying to throw politics out the window and reach some
kind of agreement that everybody can live with,'' Mayor Joe
Smitherman said.
   City Council members and Smitherman met with about two dozen
black leaders Sunday night to draw up the agreement, he said.
Smitherman said ``there are still questions to be answered'' but
that he hoped to announce the details today.
   The proposal would end white dominance of the school board and
ultimately establish a plan to alternate control between the two
factions, said Smitherman, who is white. The 5,900-student district
is about 80 percent black.

   Rescuers Monday recovered the bodies
of 69 coal miners and tunneled toward about 100 others trapped by
an explosion, although there was no sign they were alive.
   Yugoslavia's federal trade union demanded that all those
responsible for the accident, including local officials and
government ministers, resign. The cause of what would be
Yugoslavia's worst mining accident has not been determined, but the
investigation is focusing on an accumulation of coal dust or
methane gas.
   One miner who was working near the surface was pulled out of the
mine alive shortly after the blast early Sunday. Bosko Zelic, a
member of the Kreka mine's managing board, told reporters it was
unlikely any more survivors would be found.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party
declared Monday that an abortion dispute must not be allowed to
torpedo a treaty merging the two Germanys' laws.
   ``The treaty must not fail for any reason,'' said Volker Ruehe,
general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats. ``Agreement is
needed in the next few days.''
   The opposition Social Democrats have threatened to scuttle the
treaty if Kohl goes ahead with a decision to extend West Germany's
abortion restrictions to East German turf. Kohl and top members of
his coalition met into Monday's early morning hours with Social
Democrat leaders to discuss the abortion dispute. A deadlock
persisted, and another meeting was set for Wednesday.

   The Libyan government ``provided direct
support in all phases of preparation'' for an unsuccessful May 30
terrorist attack on jammed beach resorts near Tel Aviv, Israel, the
State Department said Monday.
   In a paper it said was based on information from U.S. sources,
the department said the six assault boats used in the raid were
launched from the merchant ship Tiny Star, known earlier as the
Inger M.
   It said Libya provided personnel who accompanied the ship as it
sailed from a Libyan naval base to Ras el-Hilal, on Libya's
Mediterranean coast. There it picked up at least 16 terrorists of

   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa broke off talks
Monday with Indians involved in a seven-week armed standoff with
authorities and ordered the army to tear down Mohawk barricades in
two Quebec communities.
   The premier said the Mohawks had not been negotiating in good
faith, and he was therefore obliged to assume his responsibility
for public order.
   The premier did not say how or when the army would move to take
down the barricades in the communities of Oka and Chateauguay. At
Bourassa's request, troops replaced Quebec provincial police at the
barricades a week ago. Mohawk negotiators could not be reached
immediately for comment on Bourassa's decision.

<TEXT>
   When the United States goes to war or comes
close to it, it usually invokes one or both of two great purposes:
to protect the nation against an imminent threat or to protect the
democratic ideal.
   President Bush is denied those rationales in the Persian Gulf.
Instead, he invokes the abstract principle that might should not
make right and the pragmatic view that America's ``way of life'' is
threatened if one man has the power to control the price and supply
of petroleum.
   The question that remains is whether the American people will
support an enterprise based on those purposes.
   Bush says the lesson of the 1930s is that appeasement of tyrants
does not work, and he would not find widespread disagreement with
that proposition among his countrymen.
   However, a public opinion poll probably would uncover virtual
unanimous agreement with a counter-balancing proposition: ``The
United States cannot be the world's policeman.''
   That is a lesson America extracted from the Korean stalemate of
the 1950s, the Vietnam failures of the 1970s, the budget deficits
of the 1980s.
   Bush probably would agree. He notes that 23 nations have signed
on to the effort to push the Iraqi army of President Saddam Hussein
out of Kuwait and back behind the Iraqi border. ``It is Iraq
against the world,'' Bush said last week.
   But Bush wouldn't dispute that, as in Korea and South Vietnam,
the chief ally bearing the burden is the United States.
   The end of the Cold War has denied American presidents the ready
explanation that the line had to be drawn against the advance of
communism.
   International communism is no longer a threat. It is not even
very international. Its strongest remaining outposts are Cuba, a
thorn but not a menace, and China, with which the Bush
administration maintains cordial relations.
   The Soviet Union is Bush's somewhat-silent partner in the Iraqi
engagement. The Soviets were the Iraqis' chief arms supplier, which
causes the Rev. William Sloane Coffin to observe that the Persian
Gulf showdown could not have occurred had the Cold War not ended.
   ``If the Cold War was still active, the Soviets would never have
allowed Iraq to risk a confrontation with the United States,''
Coffin said, because such a confrontation all too easily could have
led to an American-Soviet encounter. Part of the history of the
last 50 years is how the two superpowers avoided collisions.
   Coffin, who as chaplain at Yale was spiritual leader of the
anti-war movement during the Vietnam era, is critical of Bush's
``enormous'' and ``provocational'' buildup in Saudi Arabia. He
argues the effort should have been more genuinely multinational.
   Just as no realistic communist specter existed for Bush to raise
in justifying his course, no democracy was threatened by Saddam's
aggression. No democracy existed _ not in the palaces of the
emirate of Kuwait or the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Instead, Bush said ``naked aggression'' was at play in Saddam's
invasion. He equated Saddam's aggression in the 1990s to Adolf
Hitler's in the 1930s and suggested the world could not afford to
make the mistake it made then.
   ``If history teaches us anything, it is that we must resist
aggression or it will destroy our freedoms,'' Bush said in a
television address Aug. 8 to the nation. ``Appeasement does not
work.''
   Former Sen. Thomas Eagleton, D-Mo., writing in the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, demurs from the claim that appeasement was the issue.
   ``We acted for one reason and one reason only: O-I-L,'' Eagleton
wrote. ``If Mali were to invade Burkina Faso, we would send a
letter of deep regret by regular mail.''
   A week later, Bush cited the way-of-life argument, declaring
before a Pentagon audience, ``Our jobs, our way of life, our own
freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world
would suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into
the hands of Saddam Hussein.''
   That's unquestionably true, but not much of a rallying cry.

<HEAD>Joan Lunden Celebrates Tenth ``Good Morning America'' Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With some modest fanfare, Joan Lunden today
celebrates her 10th anniversary as co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning
America.'' This makes her somewhat extraordinary _ lasting in a job
that is a people-eater.
   ``I have to say I'm surprised that I'm sitting here, being the
person who has the most tenure on the morning shows,'' she says,
referring to those in the co-host and co-anchor business.
   ``It seems like it was just yesterday that I was the new kid on
the block.''
   Her time on active dawn duty goes against tradition. Network
morning show stars tend to be television's wandering tribe, often
moving on because of their own decisions, management anxiety, or
both.
   Within the last 12 months, six other such stars have left or
found new homes, notably Jane Pauley.
   Succeeded by Deborah Norville as part of the controversial
changes that sent once top-rated ``Today'' skidding into second,
Pauley is doing well in with prime time NBC News specials after 13
``Today'' years.
   ``Today'' news anchor John Palmer, an NBC News veteran, got
moved out in that show's shuffle. He left NBC and now has a
syndicated series. Faith Daniels left the ``CBS Morning News'' and
now has Palmer's old NBC job.
   Kathleen Sullivan of ``CBS This Morning'' got the gate, and now
is pondering her next move. She was succeeded by Paula Zahn, who
left ABC's ``World News This Morning.''
   And new mother Maria Shriver left NBC's ``Sunday Today'' to have
more family time, although she remains with NBC News.
   But Lunden _ who is only the third female co-host ``Good Morning
America'' has had since it began in November 1975 _ has stayed put.
   Married to television producer Michael Krauss, she's even
managed to have three kids during her time on the program.
   Lunden, who turns 40 next month and this summer signed a new
five-year contract with ABC, says she hasn't had any desire to
leave ``Good Morning America.'' But then, her life on the show has
been relatively serene.
   And her show, unlike ``Today'' and the shows that represent CBS'
many years of efforts to make ratings in the morning, hasn't had
the public turmoil of the kind that last year made ``Today'' a
daily two-hour soap opera.
   Lunden, a ceaselessly cheery woman better known for warmth than
penetrating interviews, hasn't even had a good headline-making
incident, like Sullivan's off-air jabs at CBS management that made
their way into print last year.
   The best Lunden has been able to stir up was a pre-emptive
on-air strike this summer. She told viewers that reporters from the
tabloid National Enquirer had been poking into her life, asking
friends if she'd seemed troubled lately.
   Why she bothered was a bit puzzling. In any event, the editor of
the paper said the queries hadn't turned up anything. Oh well, the
nation said, and life went on.
   Actor David Hartman, who hosted ``Good Morning America'' from
the start until newsman Charles Gibson succeeded him in January
1987, was an avuncular man on the air.
   But off-camera, he was said to be a tough, demanding man, one
who wanted it known the show's focus was on him, not his co-host.
   Despite that, Lunden, who first worked for the show as a
consumer reporter in 1976, said she got along fine with Hartman,
``because I just made sure that things (between them) stayed nice
all the time.
   ``I'm not saying that I wasn't very frustrated many times with
the real tight restrictions that were put on my abilities to do
stories and expand my job. But I didn't allow that to become an
issue with David and me.
   ``Because I knew very clearly that if that happened and that
relationship went, everything else was a moot point, I was gone, I
was out of there.''
   While Hartman was the host, ``Good Morning America'' had a good
run as first in ratings. But it started slipping toward the end of
his stay, and generally stayed in second until coming on strong
last year in the wake of the ``Today'' debacle.
   It has been first for 33 consecutive weeks. But during its long
stay in second, Lunden said, those on the show didn't get a lot of
pressure from ABC brass, or those of Capital Cities, the network's
new owners.
   ``They really just said, `Hey, go out there, enjoy it, be
curious, and have a good time, '' she said. ``They said, `If it
works, the ratings will go up.' And they did.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television...
   REASON NO. 398 TO CONTINUE BREATHING: Remember the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles? Well, CBS feels it is not enough just to
start a Saturday morning cartoon series with them on Sept. 15. It
now also says it will have a ``sneak preview'' of the one-hour
series for kids on Sept. 8, and include in the show a
save-the-environment segment called ``Turtle Tips.''

<HEAD>New Lab to Help Farmers Face Management Challenges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>URBANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Helping farmers make the best management
decisions in the face of swift agricultural changes is the goal of
a new university laboratory in the nation's heartland.
   The Farm Management Laboratory is drawing on the University of
Illinois' experience running its own farms, as well as its records
from more than 7,000 private farms and its research in agricultural
economics.
   ``Coming out of the financial crisis of the '80s, we are
concerned about the impact of environmental issues and government
programs,'' said Rob Hornbaker, chairman of the board that will
manage the laboratory.
   The lab, which opened recently in the Department of Agricultural
Economics, is gathering information and plans to distribute it to
farmers and extension advisers throughout the state, one of the
leading producers of corn and other key crops.
   Creation of the lab comes against a background of growing
pressure on farmers to become increasingly sophisticated about
managing a business subject to the whims of a global marketplace.
   Farm prices can rise or fall dramatically in one day because of
the volatility created by trading in the futures exchanges of
Chicago, where contracts on crops often are influenced by news
beyond a farmer's control.
   ``We have a lot of knowledge relating to farm management, and we
wanted to put it together in one place,'' said Hornbaker, an
agricultural economist.
   It will take about $250,000 a year to operate the lab, he said,
and university officials hope a substantial portion will come from
outside research contracts and individual and corporate
contributions.
   One source of information will be production and financial data
from more than 40 university-managed commercial farms.
   Another will be the university's Farm Business Farm Management
system, which includes comprehensive records from more than 7,000
private farms in the state.
   ``That system is directed at analyzing records for farmers and
helping them look at their business plans,'' said Hornbaker. ``But
it does not research new issues.''
   The lab is gathering data from research under way and plans to
launch new research projects.
   For example, information is being collected about raising
conventional crops like corn and wheat, vs. alternative or exotic
crops ranging from spices to Belgian endive.
   ``Analysis of the economic implications of various enterprises
has to be more site specific _ geared to a particular part of the
state _ than it has in the past,'' Hornbaker said.
   Studies likely will evaluate the economic impact of various
levels of production inputs, as well as techniques for protecting
the environment and dealing with changes in government farm
programs.
   ``There is a move toward more flexibility in farm programs, so
we have to help farmers take a closer look at the economic issues
that raises,'' Hornbaker said.
   An external advisory council of about 12 people from various
segments of Illinois' agricultural industry will help the
laboratory develop its priorities.
   As the laboratory gathers research results and management
information, it will develop educational materials that can be
distributed to farmers and extension advisers, perhaps at workshops
on particular subjects, said Hornbaker.
   ``The bottom line benefit to farmers is a more precise economic
analysis of all these issues that affect their operations so they
have a basis for making the best management decisions,'' Hornbaker
said.
   ``Everything we do will have an economic component.''

   A fluffy creature that stands barely 2
feet tall and weighs less than 2 pounds is dominating one of
America's hottest congressional races.
   Freshman Democrat Jolene Unsoeld has become a lightning rod for
anger and frustration in the same timber towns that helped elect
her as she tries to balance protection of the northern spotted owl
with that of another threatened species, the Pacific Northwest
logging community.
   Unsoeld won an open seat two years ago by 618 votes in what was
the country's closest congressional election, squeezing into office
by defeating a virtual unknown in a traditionally Democratic
district.
   And that was before the federal government decided to list the
northern spotted owl as a threatened species.
   Republicans now are sensing that Unsoeld may be endangered
herself. She is being challenged by a feisty conservative, former
state Rep. Bob Williams, who would be the first GOP congressman
from the district in 30 years.
   Williams was the Republican challenger against the state's
popular Gov. Booth Gardner in 1988. He lost in a landslide, but
gave the governor fits with his frenetic energy and kamikaze
political style.
   Unsoeld and Williams both have opposition in the Sept. 18
primary, but they already are campaigning against each other. The
candidates talk about the deficit and the savings and loan debacle,
abortion and basic philosophical differences, but the campaign is
dominated by the timber issue.
   The owl in July was listed as threatened under the federal
Endangered Species Act. The decision is certain to shut down
millions of acres of prized old-growth timber, largely on U.S.
Forest Service lands, to protect the owl.
   Loggers fear that the annual harvest will be slashed by half,
decimating small timber communities that dot the lush Olympic
Peninsula and other timberlands of Washington, Oregon and Northern
California.
   Unsoeld, an ardent environmentalist, is on the defensive. On
several occasions, she's waded into hostile timber rallies, a sort
of Jolene-in-the-lion's-den approach that buttressed her scrappy
image.
   In May, she was barred by angry picketers from a union hall
where she'd been invited. She stood in the chill west wind for
nearly three hours, putting up with taunts and jeers.
   ``I'm doing my damnedest to support you!'' she cried at one
point.
   Unsoeld, a mountain-climber, citizen activist and four-year
member of the state House before going to Washington, sees herself
as a centrist and a realist on the issue.
   She backed a congressionally approved ban on the export of
unprocessed logs from most state-owned lands in the West. In
Washington, the new law will cut the exports of state timber by 75
percent. Domestic mills will be helped, but loggers and
longshoremen say it will cause a net loss of jobs.
   Unsoeld, 58, also wants tax breaks and negotiations with the
Japanese as possible ways to expand the timber supply and volume
processed before export. She champions ``New Forestry,'' which
includes selective logging of old-growth timber.
   Unsoeld shrugs off the anger from the traditionally Democratic
loggers.
   ``Timber communities have been going through shock, rage,
anguish and fear _ all absolutely legitimate emotions,'' she said
in an interview. ``But we are beginning to see elected officials
and community leaders say, `Hey, we can sit here screaming and
crying or we can do something about it.'''
   Williams, 48, a bespectacled, intense man who served a decade in
the Legislature and earned his spurs as a budget watchdog, says
Unsoeld deserves every ounce of the blame she's getting.
   ``She was elected by the timber workers and she has deserted
them,'' he said. ``They want someone in Congress who will go to bat
not only for their jobs but for their way of life.''
   He accuses Unsoeld of representing ``the more extreme part of
the environmental movement.''
   Williams supports higher harvest levels, amendments to the
Endangered Species Act to require consideration of socioeconomic
impacts, a study to see whether owls can survive in second-growth
forests, tax incentives for woodlot owners, and tougher trade
negotiations with the Japanese. He opposes export bans.
   Says Unsoeld, ``After ranting and raving for months, my opponent
is now advocating three-fourths of my timber plan.''
   Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., who represents a neighboring
congressional district, calls Williams ``an opportunist challenger
... who is trying to exploit the fears of working people.''
   Lance Henderson, spokesman for the state Republican Party,
shoots back: ``Unsoeld's radical environmental views and her
extreme liberal views on economics, her anti-business views and her
lack of sufficient support for the timber community shows she
doesn't fit the district.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Mexico City has been largely rebuilt since that
disastrous earthquake of 1985, but its citizens are not the same.
In rebuilding their shattered city the people learned something
about themselves. They learned that by pulling together they no
longer had to depend on a sometimes undependable government.

   The catastrophic earthquake that devastated
Mexico City five years ago lasted only a minute or so, but it set
in motion political and social tremors still felt today.
   Besides leveling buildings and homes, killing thousands (some
estimates say 30,000) and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless,
the quake seriously damaged the image of invincibility of the
governing political party, radicalized many citizens and
demonstrated to many others, if only briefly, the viability of
``people power.''
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) still governs the
city of 15 million, but less certainly than before. Most of the
volunteers who poured into the streets returned home changed, more
confident of their power and distrustful of the government. Some of
the volunteers stayed on as political activists.
   In the moments after the thunder of buildings falling to the
ground subsided, citizens took charge.
   They rushed into the battered streets to rescue the trapped and
unearth the dead. They set up shelters for the homeless and started
rebuilding. And they did all this without help from a paternalistic
government that had always done everything; did it without the
omnipresent PRI.
   ``I would say that five years later it is still trembling in
Mexico City,'' says Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a political analyst,
newspaper columnist and researcher at the National University's
Center for U.S. Studies.
   ``It showed Mexico City for just a second in the historical
framework of time what it would be like to be in a city where the
government becomes subordinate and accountable and the people
emerge, and the people rule and the government obeys.''
   The quake hit at 7:19 a.m. on Sept. 19, while most people were
at home or en route to work. Registering 8.1 in the Richter scale,
it was classified a ``great'' quake. Another the next day measured
7.5, but most of the damage was already done.
   In a country where the government had been the main provider of
assistance for decades, citizens of all stripes _ students,
neighbors, private engineers, tough street gangs _ went into the
streets by the thousands to help. One government estimate said
there were 1 million volunteers, unusual in a country with no
tradition of grassroots volunteerism.
   They organized themselves into brigades to dig their way to
survivors, pull out bodies, bring food and water to the homeless
and the rescue workers.
   ``The people were trying to save people's lives and the
government was trying to regain control,'' says Adrian de Lope,
then a student at the private Anahuac University.
   Now 25, de Lope was one of those who stayed in volunteer work.
He spent four years after graduation working with the school's
housing and community development project for earthquake victims.
He's still a fund-raiser for the project.
   ``The people have the power, or at least they know that they can
have it,'' he says. ``They now know that they are able to do things
that they didn't know they were able to do before.''
   Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at the Colegio de Mexico, says many
city dwellers were already fed up with the authoritarian political
system.
   ``But that particular (governmental) tardiness, the slowness of
the response, made them more willing to criticize openly the
behavior of the bureaucracy and the lack of leadership of
(President Miguel) de la Madrid.''
   On the other hand, government officials say no city hit by such
a large disaster has been able to rebuild so fast. They point to
the reconstruction, replacement, repair or financing of 105,000
housing units in three years.
   ``The magnitude of the damage, the tragedy, was so great that we
even had to take a while to be able to perceive and know the extent
of the disaster,'' says Enrique Jackson, president of the PRI in
Mexico City. ``Certainly if it hadn't been for society we wouldn't
have been able to begin to attend to and help the affected people.
The people had a big role.''
   The PRI began to recoup, organizing residents into
reconstruction committees at the new housing units.
   Out of the rubble, questions arose. Citizens asked how the
buildings that fell had been built. They wondered why hospitals,
government offices, the 14-story Nuevo Leon building collapsed,
killing hundreds.
   After a week, the government stopped counting bodies, as if to
try to diminish the disaster.
   ``The government was directly in charge of some of those
constructions, somebody you can pinpoint as the guilty one,'' Meyer
says. ``You can end with another classic case of corruption, so you
diminish the importance of the damage and hope that society will
not demand an inquiry.''
   No one went to jail in connection with any of the collapses.
   But in the July 1988 general election, de la Madriess to negotiate.
   Both Scowcroft and Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed al-Mashat endorsed
the concept of a mediating role by U.N. Secretary General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, who is seeking urgent talks with Iraqi officials
this week.
   Scowcroft said Saddam has shown himself to be a realist, citing
his willingness two weeks ago to bow to Iran's terms for a
settlement of their eight-year war. Among other concessions, Saddam
agreed to recognize the pre-war boundary of the two countries.
   Al-Mashat contrasted Iraq's ``desire for peace'' with the
American ``design to have war.'' He said the U.S. aggressive
intentions were demonstrated by the dispatch of offensive weaponry,
including stealth fighter bombers, to Saudi Arabia.
   He said the U.S. allegation that Iraq posed a threat to Saudi
Arabia ``was the biggest deception in history.''
   The undersecretary of state for political affairs, Robert
Kimmitt, said that sooner or later, Saddam's hand will be forced by
the economic sanctions.
   ``I think they (the sanctions) are becoming increasingly
effective. I think the difference between this sanction regime and
past sanctions regimes is that it enjoys the virtually unanimous
support of the world community and therefore I think the sanctions
are beginning to pinch more and more as each day goes by,'' Kimmitt
said.

<HEAD>MEXICO CITY: Party leader.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The PRI's Jackson says economic crisis and increasing masses of
poor, not the quake, hurt his party. The party won in the voting
districts hardest hit by the quake, he says.
   The PRI won the congressional and Mexico City assembly races,
but in those same districts, the left defeated Salinas.
   The city today looks much the same as it did. Many of the shiny
glass-walled high-rises are reconstructed earthquake-damaged
buildings.
   By contrast, the weathered steel skeleton of an Agriculture
Department building juts out on Reforma Boulevard, one of numerous
structures yet to be rebuilt or torn down. There are parks or
vacant lots where buildings once stood. Small camps house some of
the thousands who remain homeless.
   Brightly colored vecindades _ small row houses around an inner
patio _ stand out in low-income neighborhoods where old shacks,
given a final blow in the quake, were torn down.
   Some government offices moved out of downtown or to the
provinces.
   A construction code passed after the quake stiffened
requirements for tall buildings. But there is lingering worry about
another major quake. Seismologists are keeping an eye on a fault in
a different location off the Pacific Coast. Movement there, they
say, could shake the lake bed where Mexico City sits as strongly as
the last quake.
   ``If there is a tremor now, it's not the same as before. Now we
know that buildings fall and people die. Now people react with more
fear to earthquakes,'' says Carmen Blanco, a National University
psychology professor. She worked in the school's post-earthquake
psychology service.
   If the city has been largely rebuilt, its people will never be
the same again.
   Evangelina Corona, 52, who worked as seamstress on San Antonio
Abad Street, dared not confront her employer before the quake. Now
she is an outspoken union leader.
   Before the quake, she sewed so fast her machine smoked. She
thought it good of her employer to give a country woman with a
third-grade education a chance.
   Then the buildings crammed with sewing factories gave way,
trapping hundreds of seamstresses. Her boss said the jobs were
gone, there would be little severance.
   By mid-October, seamstresses from the different factories had
organized into a non-government union.
   Antonio Paz quit his job as a government social worker because
of the way the government was handling recovery efforts. He helped
organize his damaged neighborhood first to survive, then rebuild,
without government help.
   Paz works with an organization called Campamentos Unidos (Camps
United), a self-help housing association rebuilding neighborhoods
with no government assistance. With help from Operation USA and
other international groups, it also has built a neighborhood clinic
and is planning to build a Center for Studies of the Neighborhood
to provide research, advice and training for projects.
   Some of the quake victims are also rebuilding their lives.
   Inspired by handicapped Vietnam Veterans in Miami where he was
fitted for prosthesis, Celso Garcia has remarried and he and his
wife are expecting a baby. His first wife, one of his two
daughters, a sister and a cousin died in the quake when their
fourth-floor apartment collapsed. Both his legs were amputated.
   Dr. Jose Juan Hernandez Cruz, trapped four days between the
concrete slabs of the government's Juarez Hospital, has not married
but has adopted a daughter, now 2. He works at a Health Department
clinic until mid-afternoon and at a prison in the evenings. He's
looking foward to visiting the Marseilles, France, team that
rescued him.
   The 19 babies who were discovered one by one in the wreckage of
hospitals, the last one nearly nine days after the quake, are now
in kindergarten. One has met the American firemen who rescued her.
   One of the 19 is Evelia Alvarez Gasca, who lost her mother in
the quake. She is being cared for by a 31-year-old aunt who has
cancer.
   Raul Reyes Gonzalez is a street vendor, selling fried pork skins
and other tidbits. Since the earthquake he has been doing volunteer
work at a neighborhood housing association.
   Reyes Gonzalez' old slum neighborhood was the site of one of
Campamentos Unidos' first projects. Before the quake it was a
collection of one-room wood and cardboard shacks with two bathrooms
for 600 people, too flimsy to be damaged.
   Government and private projects put up condominiums, replacing
communal toilets and laundry sinks with facilities for each
apartment.
   ``Simply with the bathrooms, socially there has been a 90-degree
turn,'' Reyes says. ``We aren't yet high society, but we're living
like human beings.''
   He says he still works as a volunteer for the satisfaction of
seeing others ``have a home worthy of a Mexican.''

   Five years ago the world of Celso Garcia
collapsed around him. Today, with the help of some handicapped
Vietnam veterans in Florida, he has put it together again.
   Garcia's wife, his 4-year-old daughter, a sister and a cousin
all were killed when the five-story building where they lived
collapsed in the Mexico City earthquake of Sept. 19, 1985. Garcia's
legs had to be amputated.
   ``The walls split apart as if sliced by a knife,'' he recalls.
``Just before that I watched the wall at the head of the bed fall
on my wife.''
   ``I saw the floor open up and I fell through.''
   He called to his family, one by one. Only Rubi, his 7-year-old
daughter pinned beneath him, answered.
   Trapped in the rubble, he at first felt a tingling in his legs.
Then he felt nothing.
   ``I began to see myself without legs,'' he says.
   When a rescue worker reached them hours later, he took away the
piece of glass Garcia had been gripping in his hand, a way out
should the wait become too long and the pain too great.
   Rubi suffered severed tendons in one arm. With therapy, she has
regained most of the use of her fingers.
   With most of his family dead and his home destroyed, Garcia
wondered what the future held. Answers came from the veterans in
Miami.
   With help from the World Organizations for Private and Voluntary
Assistance, he went to South Florida to be fitted for prostheses
and for rehabilitation. The Broward County Paralyzed Veterans
Association paid his airfare.
   His rehabilitation at the Sunrise Rehabilitation Center in
Sunrise went far beyond the physical.
   ``I thought at one time that a handicapped person wasn't
respected or valued, that he was a burden,'' he said. ``But I saw
that even though they were handicapped in worse ways, those
veterans had their lives.''
   For nearly three months, he went bowling with the veterans, to
shopping centers, everywhere.
   ``I saw that they were as normal as anyone and I asked myself
why I couldn't do this in my country, and this has raised my
spirits,'' he says.
   Garcia is now remarried and his new wife is expecting a baby. He
has a job as coordinator of the vocational junior high school where
he used to teach.
   They live in an apartment complex put up by Rotary
International. He drives an adapted car, also from World
Organizations. He taught summer classes to neighborhood children.
   ``When I have the opportunity when I go out I go without
prostheses so that people who have this problem or may have it in
the future know you can overcome things,'' he says.

   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Here are some facts about the earthquake that
devastated Mexico City on Sept. 19, 1985:
   SIZE _ The quake that struck at 8:19 a.m. (CST) on Sept. 19
measured 8.1 on the Richter scale. It was followed by an aftershock
measuring 7.5 at 7:38 p.m. on Sept. 20.
   VICTIMS _ The government's official death toll of 4,541 was not
raised after Sept. 26. The U.S. Agency for International
development cited an unofficial government estimate of 9,500.
Unofficial estimates, based on information from foreign rescuers
and other sources, put the toll at between 20,000 and 30,000.
   HOMELESS _ An estimated 250,000 were left without homes.
Government and private housing programs built, repaired or provided
credit for 105,000 housing units.
   DAMAGE _ About 950 buildings collapsed and 4,775 others were
damaged over about 20 square miles of the more than 550-square-mile
city. In Ciudad Guzman, Jalisco, 3,000 homes were damaged or
destroyed. In Jalisco, Guerrero and Michoacan, 56 other buildings
were affected.
   The Mexico City damage included 30 percent of the public schools
and 25 percent of the hospital capacity. Major streets, water
systems and electrical stations were damaged and national and
international telephone installations were destroyed.
   COST _ The government estimated damage to buildings and services
at $4.1 billion. Housing reconstruction costs from 1986 to 1990
totaled $716 million. The Red Cross, UNICEF and other Mexican and
international organizations built new housing and provided credit.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Look up eponym in your Webster's: ``one for whom
or which something is named or supposedly named...'' Just as the
name Webster is closely linked with dictionary, many others have
achieved immortality through eponymity, but usually by accident.

   They are departed now, one and all:
   Rudolf Diesel. Antoine Sax. Amelia Jenks Bloomer. William
Russell Frisbie. Jules Leotard. Danile C. Stillson.
   But glory, glory, hallelujah, their names go marching on. Theirs
is immortality achieved by eponym: someTHING named for someBODY.
   Diesel's engines make the world go 'round under his name. This
is fortunate. His first patent for them issued Feb. 28, 1892, was
for an ``Arbeitsver fahren und Ausfuhrungsart fur
Verbrennungskraftmaschinen'' (combustion power engine) which is an
eponym to break jaws with.
   The four-slotted screws of Henry F. Phillips hold much of the
world together. The adjustable wrench invented in the 1800s by
Stillson tightens what's loose.
   Of the legacy of Monsieur Sax (1814-1894), a Belgian maker of
music and its implements, it has been said: ``A gentleman is he who
knows how to play a saxophone and doesn't.''
   Immortality by eponym is accidental, rarely by design.
   W.R. Frisbie modestly stamped his name on pie plates that issued
in the 1870s from his bakery in Bridgeport, Conn. He had no inkling
those skimmable pie tins which bore his name would become a
tradition at Yale University among tin-tossing students and would
years later catch the eye of the Wham-O Manufacturing Co. in search
for a name for its plastic discs. Despite a slight misspelling,
W.F. Frisbie sails through the air somewhere on Earth daily.
   Fitzroy James Henry Somerset, Lord Raglan, illustrates the
unpredictability of eponymity. He lost an arm at Waterloo, telling
his amputators: ``Here, don't take that arm away until I get my
ring off the finger.'' He commanded the British in the Crimean War
and their boneheaded charge of the Light Brigade. And what is he
remembered for? A coat sleeve.
   Lord Cardigan led that charge in a brilliant gold-trimmed
uniform. We remember him for a humbler garment. But it is a rare
war that bequeaths two eponyms.
   Even rarer was a double eponymery by one man, Edward Stanley,
Earl of Derby. He sponsored a horse race in 1780 which took his
name. So did the domed hat that men wore to the track.
   Another Englishman was a Mr. Derrick, an executioner in the
first Elizabethan Age whose scaffold resembled its latter-day
namesake and whose given name has become as lost as have his
customers. His name might well have become eponymous for
ingratitude. One of his clients was the Earl of Essex, who once had
pardoned Derrick for a rape charge. When Queen Elizabeth later
soured on Essex, it was Derrick who carried out her ultimate
displeasure.
   Food and drink, especially alcohol, are well-traveled pathways
to eponymity. If there wasn't a Harvey Wallbanger, there was a
Harvey, says Tad Tuleja in his authoritive work, ``Namesakes.'' He
was a California surfer of the 1960s given to ricocheting off walls
after a surfeit of the drink's direct ancestor, then named a Doozie.
   Samuel Benedict, an ``American socialite'' circa 1894, became an
eponym by one account when Oscar of the Waldorf served him poached
eggs on muffins covered with hollandaise sauce to better commence a
morning after. Another version says the eggs were first served at
Delmonico's to a Mr. and Mrs. LeGrand Benedict. Howsoever, eggs
Benedict.
   Then there was Clara Hirschfield. Her father, Leo, concocted a
cylindrical chocolate candy in 1894. What to name it? Hirschfield
seized upon his nickname for Clara, and the Tootsie Roll was born.
   The White House has been an eponymic gold mine. Baby Ruth, the

Heimlich, currently of Cincinnati, a rare achiever of eponymity in
his own lifetime. Pregnant mothers feel less pain thanks to Dr.
Fernand Lamaze. This Frenchman devised his method after a 1951
visit to the Soviet Union where babies were delivered by the Pavlov
method named for Ivan Petrovich Pavlov. It involved the conditioned
reflexes Pavlov used to get dogs to salivate by ringing a bell.

   That perfection is hardly a requisite for eponymity is shown by
the enduring fame of playwright Richard Sheridan's Mrs. Malaprop or
the real-life massacres of English by the Rev. William Archibald
Spooner, an Oxford don. He passed away in 1930 but left an eponymic
legacy such as the spoonerism he delivered to a shy groom he had
just wed: ``Son, it is kisstomary to cuss the bride.''
   The universe marches ineluctably and eponymously to the laws of
Boyle, Robert; Ohm, George; Newton, Sir Isaac. It shakes to the
scale of Richter, Charles F., a California seismologist. It sweats
or shivers to the degrees of Fahrenheit, Gabriel Daniel, a
17th-century German-Dutch instrument maker, or if not his, to the
degrees of Anders Celsius, a Swedish astronomer (1701-44).
   Other eponymic laws govern our lives with a more tolerant rule:
Parkinson's, C. Northcote, based on the study of the British civil
service in his years as a professor in Malaya: ``Work expands so as
to fill the time available for its completion.''
   Or Murphy, Edward A., an aircraft engineer in Ohio. He is not
the only source cited by eponymists for Murphy's Law, but will
suffice: ``If anything can go wrong, it will.''
   In everyday life eponyms are everywhere. In the bedroom bureau:
perhaps descendants of the tights Leotard wore on his French
trapeze over a century ago. Possibly a trimmer version of the
pantaloons Mrs. Bloomer, an early feminist, devised in the 1800s to
liberate womankind from hoop skirts. More likely the namesakes of
Levi Strauss, the German immigrant who sped to the California gold
rush with a load of canvas to make the sourdoughs' tents. They
needed pants, instead. Mayhap, but unlikely, we hold up those Levis
with the belt of Browne, Sam, a 19th-century British soldier who
designed it to keep the uniform from sagging lopsidedly when
wearing a sword.
   In the kitchen cupboard or refrigerator or at ladies' socials we
find the works of the late Earl S. Tupper, a chemist with DuPont
who was fascinated with the properties of polyethylene. In the
cookie jar we may find the fig Newton, so named by the Kennedy
Biscuit Works of Boston after one of its suburbs which sounded more
euphonious than a fig Framingham Center.
   In the living room ashtray may be the remains of Jean Nicot's
eponym. A French diplomat in Portugal in the 1560s, he received a
smokable plant from the New World which his grateful sovereign
named Nicotiana tabacum and the U.S. Surgeon General later
condemned as nicotine.
   In the garden may bloom the Christmas plant Joel Roberts
Poinsett brought back from Mexico during his difficult
ambassadorship there in the 1840s. Or the yellow-blooming shrub
William Forsyth returned with from China several decades before.
   In the trees and heavens eponyms trill and soar: Steller's jay,
Audubon's warbler, Cassin's sparrow, Swainson's hawk.
   We used to drive Tin Lizzies. There was no Elizabeth, alas. The
term most likely derives from tin limousine. But we still drive
eponymously on the roads surfaced a la John L. Macadam, an
18th-century Scot. If on foot, we may huddle against the elements
in the slightly misspelled eponym of Charles Macintosh (1766-1843).
   Eponymery also has its dark side. Blacks suffered under the yoke
of Jim Crow regulations which took their name from the song ``Jump,
Jim Crow'' sung by pioneer white minstrel Thomas Dartmouth Rice in
the early 1800s.
   In World War I Paris felt the wrath of Big Bertha, a mammoth
cannon named for the wife of its maker, Bertha Krupp von Bohlen und
Halbach.
   For years, of course, Frenchmen disposed of each other with the
invention of Dr. Joseph-Ignace Guillotin. He devised it during the
French Revolution out of humanitarian and egalitarian impulses. It
brought instant departure instead of a tortuous one, theretofore
reserved to the upper classes.
   From Lamaze to guillotin, birth to death, we live in an
eponymous world. We always have, ever since someone opened...by

   Among those original settlers were the brothers Jacob and
William Kersh, whose father, Andrew, immigrated to South Carolina
from Germany with his family in the mid-18th century. As a
teen-ager, Andrew Kersh was bonded out as an indentured servant to
help pay for his family's passage to America. He later fought in
the Revolutionary War, with the 6th South Carolina Regiment.
   Jacob Kersh served in the War of 1812. For years his sword was
on display in the museum in the old state Capitol, but when they
moved the museum, somebody lost it.
   William Kersh was an enterprising blacksmith as well as a
farmer. Figuring that cowbells were hard to come by on the
frontier, he hammered out a barrel full of bells before he left and
sold them along the way.
   He also brought along his slave, Bub, an African he had bought
off a slave ship in Charleston and taught to speak English.
   Many of the early Shiloh settlers owned slaves. Jones, in his
account, says that after a new church was built ``part of it was
set apart for the Negroes, and later on when there were white
people enough to fill the church, the Negroes were allowed the use
of it one Sunday in each month, and a preacher was employed to
preach to them.''
   The first Shiloh tabernacle was a brush arbor, with six tents
built of pine logs. Large bonfires made of pine knots provided the
lighting.
   For years a fence surrounded the grounds so that people could
bring livestock and chickens for food. They erected a communal feed
pen filled with corn to feed the animals.
   Mary Baines, 64, another bean sheller at the recent meeting,
remembers the chickens.
   ``Before we had refrigeration, everybody brought chickens,'' she
says. ``We all had our own stump out back where we had the chickens
cooked. You could hire a cook to come up here night and day for $10
for the whole time.''
   Before electricity was installed, campers brought with them wood
stoves for the cooking.
   Mrs. Baines says her family's tent had a sawdust floor until the
present structure was built 17 years ago. Now it's sort of a
triplex, with quarters for the families of her son, Doug Baines and
son-in-law, Larry Varner, all under the same roof.
   The Rev. Rodney Smith, minister of Shiloh United Methodist
Church for the past four years, says there are presently 50 tents.
Any church member can build a cabin on the church's 88 acres,
provided they maintain it. Most are passed along from generation to
generation.
   A new addition is a small museum, built in the style of the
tents, which houses memorabilia, photos and scrapbooks telling of
Shiloh's history.
   That history recalls the Civil War, which brought an end to the
camp meetings for the next two decades.
   When Mississippi seceded from the Union and war was imminent,
Shiloh mustered a company of volunteers, the Rankin Grays, to go
fight the Yankees.
   The camp meetings resumed in 1881 and have been held every year
since, except for three years later in that decade when the country
was suffering a yellow fever epidemic.
   The Christian crusaders at Shiloh have suffered some other
tribulations.
   A note written by Mrs. Lula Martin Lindsey in 1928, from
information provided by her father, Albert E. Martin, tells of the
struggle against demon rum.
   ``Almost from the beginning, the Camp Meeting has met with
opposition. First, from evil disposed persons who came to the
grounds to create trouble. When whiskey was plentiful, the Camp
Meeting rowdy was generally on hand and policemen had to be
employed to keep order. When whiskey was outlawed, the Camp Meeting
rowdy disappeared. If the eighteenth amendment (Prohibition) is
repealed and we have whiskey again, these disturbers of public
worship likely will be on hand again.''
   In preparing for the 1860 meeting, a meeting of the tent holders
passed a resolution stating that ``we forbid the sale of cakes and
spirituous liquors within the limits of the corporation.''
   Shiloh survived the repeal of Prohibition, and attendance
remains healthy, though not as healthy as it once was. Smith
estimated that 500 people came this year. Back in the '30s,
according to contemporary accounts, campers averaged between 1,500
and 2,000.
   Still they come, year after year.
   Dorothy Ruth Moore and Lou Martin Sanders of Ridgefield, sisters
who are descendants of William Kersh and other original settlers,
now bring their grandchildren.
   ``I just want them to KNOW,'' Mrs. Moore said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Art treasures plundered from conquered Nazi
Germany have been turning up from Moscow to Krakow to a tiny town
in Texas. Now, with the two Germanys ready to reunite, officials
hope to restore a cultural heritage that was torn asunder by war.
Part of that effort is to find the pilfered artwork and get it
back.

<TEXT>
   In 1945, as the Red Army advanced on
Germany, a Soviet soldier stumbled across a stunning collection of
drawings and watercolors, by masters such as Rembrandt, Durer and
Van Dyck, stashed in a castle for safekeeping.
   The soldier, an architect in an engineering unit, bundled what
he could off to Moscow and stored the works in a museum. There they
sat for decades, covered and concealed from the world.
   Now, the aging soldier says the 364 pieces should go back to
their original owner, a German museum, the Kunsthalle in Bremen.
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has written to
his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, asking that the works
be returned.
   The Germanys, racing to reunite their politics and peoples, are
also trying to restore their cultural heritage, devastated by war
and its plunders.
   But the task is as monumental as some of the missing treasures.
   During World War II, German museums, libraries and churches
packed up their most valuable works and shipped them off for
safekeeping from Allied bombing raids. Later, many treasures were
again moved by the Nazis, to caves or salt mines, to hide them from
advancing troops.
   The destruction of war, the multiple moves, incomplete or
missing inventories, and plundering occupation troops all conspired
to conceal the fate of some of the treasures.
   Art historians say troops from both the West and the East moved
German artworks out of the country after the war.
   In addition, fires were often reported in art repositories. Some
historians question whether some of the fires actually occurred or
whether they destroyed everying that was claimed to have been lost.
   ``I fear that much of what was officially burned is still
somewhere,'' said one museum researcher who didn't want to be
identified by name.
   In addition to individual instances of plundering, many art
historians say some treasures were removed with official sanction
for use as cultural reparations.
   Although that policy was later rejected in the West and many
objects were returned, historians say it is not possible to tell
how much of what was taken was given back.
   ``The problem is that this was done by forces who were operating
like the intelligence forces, without documents or with documents
that were not declassified up to now,'' the museum official said.
``It was a problem of all four of the Allies.''
   ``For many years these things were considered lost anyway
because we had no information whatsoever,'' said a government
source in Bonn who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``You could say this is one of the last fields of really
finishing with the consequences of war.''
   In July, government and art representatives from West and East
Germany agreed to establish a Berlin-based databank to pool
information from museums, churches and libraries on missing art and
its last known location.
   Klaus Maurice, director of the West German Cultural Foundation
of the States, said the list could be completed in three years.
   ``We will make a list of what was lost, not what must be
found,'' he said. ``We don't want to give advice for police.''
   Improving East-West relations and recent finds have already
fueled hopes that more could follow.
   In a Texas court, an East German church, financed by West
Germany, is fighting the heirs of a U.S. soldier who the church
claims made off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine.
U.S. forces occupied the Quedlinburg area, 120 miles southwest of
Berlin, in 1945.
   The treasures include a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from
the 9th or 10th century, a 10th-century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.
   An art investigator working with the Prussian Cultural Heritage
Foundation tracked the Quedlinburg treasures to Whitewright, Texas,
about 60 miles north of Dallas, last May.
   The foundation, which includes 15 museums in West Berlin, the
Prussian State Library and Prussian State Archives, houses the
collections of the former Prussian empire.
   Curators from its museums are working, with varying degrees of
success, to find and return their lost treasures, ranging from
Trojan gold to prehistoric baskets.
   The Bremen case is typical of what happened to Germany's art
during the war. The museum sent its masterpieces to several places
throughout the country for safekeeping in 1943, said director
Siegfried Salzmann.
   About 4,000 items went to a castle northwest of Berlin ``to
prevent damages by air attacks,'' he said. Soviet troops occupied
the area in April 1945.
   The Soviet soldier, Victor Baldin, asked his superiors what was
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest, he packed
off what he could to Moscow, Salzmann said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Once the only sounds came from the constant rush
of icy water or the occasional dip of a canoe's paddle. Now,
however, the pristine silence of this Michigan woodland is
shattered by the roar of war, the National Guard in training.

   The trout still rise. Deaf to the war
around them, they lift to the surface, rippling the black river in
chase of mayflies hatching in the dusk of a Michigan evening.
   Bombs make thunder in the distance. The soldiers of Camp
Grayling are in training.
   If not for the National Guard, the Au Sable River would be
heaven for trout fishermen, as it once was.
   If not for the fishermen, the state forest in the heart of
Michigan's Lower Peninsula would be a military paradise for
simulating air raids and tank shellings.
   The town of Grayling delicately depends on both for its bustling
economy.
   ``You will find a way to compromise or you will perish,'' City
Manager Jerry Morford says. ``Some people like to fish. Some people
think the Guard needs a place to train.''
   Grayling needs both.
   The river cuts through its heart. And the town of about 2,500 is
literally surrounded by the accoutrements of war. The airfield is
on the northwest side of town. The main camp sits on the west, with
a proposed air assault strip farther out. The tank firing range is
on the east.
   On the air-to-ground artillery range north of Grayling, 4,000
jets and helicopters and gunships each year bombard the dun-colored
soil with bombs and bullets. Some of the bombs are live. Most are
concrete dummies.
   Some local residents take comfort in the shelling. ``I get some
sense of security out of knowing that these people are here,'' says
Henry Mason, a World War II veteran living in nearby Gaylord.
   Guard opponents worry that the exploded shells are lacing the
river headwaters with lead and other heavy metals, creating a toxic
no-man's land. Guard officials refute the claim.
   To add to the irony, a pair of bald eagles has been successfully
raising chicks inside the artillery range for three years.
   This was a rather contained battle until the late 1970s, when
the end of the military draft focused new attention on building up
the nation's oldest force, the National Guard.
   National Guard training camps are expanding around the country
to train the nation's estimated 568,000 citizen-soldiers, many of
whom are now headed for the Persian Gulf.
   The Guard proposes a firing range on federal land in
northeastern Montana, a 630,000-acre tank range in Nevada. Maine's
National Guard wants to build a 720,000-acre training camp called
Deepwoods.
   ``They're squandering our natural resources,'' says Grace
Bukowski in Nevada with the national Rural Alliance for Military
Accountability. ``I question the need for more acres. The military
now controls 25 million acres in the country.''
   In Michigan, Camp Grayling has become a year-round proving
ground for the state's forces, for other states and even for
military contractors wanting to test weapon systems.
   The annual surge of Guardsmen peaked in 1987 at more than 35,000
when the whole 38th Infantry Division based in Indiana came to
Michigan to train.
   The clash with fishermen came in 1988, on the opening day of
trout season. Anglers on the Au Sable waded into the water to the
sound of Ohio Guardsmen firing their tank cannons.
   The timing was unfortunate, says Lt. Col. Brian Downey, a
spokesman for the Michigan National Guard. Since then, the Guard
has pledged to keep silent on holiday weekends and in the dead of
night.
   ``The basic element of the conflict is because we make noise,''
Downey says. ``It's the nature of the place. Until they find a
silencer for a howitzer, there's no way to get around it.''
   The Guard means about $4 million a year to Grayling by the
military's own estimates of what Guardsmen spend on gasoline,
chewing gum, beer and other items. Just to make sure, the Guard
sends camp participants on their two-day passes with $100 in their
pockets.
   To some, Grayling has sold its heritage to the military.
   ``There's a disease here,'' says Arnold Copeland, a Connecticut
fisherman who retired here last year. ``The river is being
stake-driven through the heart by military officials.
   ``I am just sick of people whose life is dependent on wrecking
cars or killing fish or blowing up trees.''
   A mile or two from the tank-shelling range, Rusty Gates' lodge
marks the beginning of what fishermen revere as the Holy Water.
That is how good the fishing is. That is how religious trout
fishermen are about their sport.
   Gates hosts fishermen from around the world and speaks with
venom about the Guard.
   A forest fire raced along the Au Sable last spring, gutting
cabins and burning trees right to the water's edge.
   Guardsmen claimed they saved Gates' lodge from burning. But when
they showed up two days later with cameras to document the
``save,'' Gates ran them off his land.
   Instead, Gates gave credit to fate. ``We are just fortunate,''
he said, sitting outside his lodge, flanked by the river on one
side and charred timber on three.
   Poet Michael Delp lived and taught in Grayling for 13 years and
recalls local stories _ an irate cabin owner who held a trespassing
tank at bay with his shotgun; Guardsmen strolling into town
convenience stores with rifles slung across their backs; lying
awake in the dark at 3 a.m. as the house shakes from the
concussions of artillery.
   ``It's ridiculous. It looks like occupied Europe sometimes,'' he
says.

   He kicked a drug and alcohol habit, but actor
Gregory Harrison is still addicted. To surfing.
   He's so addicted that he once went to Denmark to surf in the
chill North Sea waters, surrounded by nudist bathers.
   ``I found an old surfboard and surfed for three days,'' he says.
``It was so cold. That's what I remember. That it was cold and
everyone else was naked. I was the only person on the beach with
clothes on.''
   Harrison, who stars in the new CBS comedy series ``The Family
Man,'' plus a couple of TV movies during the 1990-91 season, spends
much of his time on a quest to ride the world's best waves.
   In ``The Family Man,'' Harrison's fourth series, he's a fire
chief trying to raise four children after the death of his wife. It
premieres next Saturday. His most recent series was ``Falcon
Crest.'' Before that he starred in ``Trapper John'' for seven
years, and was in ``Logan's Run'' for one season.
   In one of the upcoming TV movies, Harrison plays a psychopathic
killer stalking Jane Seymour in ``Angel of Death'' on CBS. Later in
the season he stars in ``Sail Away,'' filmed on location in the
Virgin Islands.
   He's also the host of ``Shore Break,'' a one-hour syndicated
show about travel, sports and fashions.
   Harrison's passion for surfing has taken him to South America,
Central America, Africa, Bali, Spain, Portugal, France and the
South Pacific.
   He grew up in Catalina where his father operated a glass-bottom
boat, and started surfing at age 11.
   Harrison says surfing is more than just a pastime. ``It's a
craving,'' he says. ``Now that I truly understand what cravings are
all about. In surfing terms I'm an addict. People who are not
addicted find they have to get up too early, travel too far, work
too hard at it. Only the addicts keep at it. Seven out of 10 times
you don't find waves. It's the other three times that keep you
coming back.''
   He has kicked another addiction.
   ``After `Trapper John' I've been taking care of myself,'' he
says. ``I've made some changes in my life and priorities. I went to
the Betty Ford Clinic to stop my addiction to drugs and alcohol. I
can't blame that on `Trapper John.' I'm genetically inclined to be
an an alcoholic and addict. My income made it possible to succumb.
   ``After `Trapper John' I was burned out. `Falcon Crest' was as
pleasureable as the last few years of `Trapper John' were
miserable. I enter this new series with confidence that it will be
a good experience and knowing that I won't have to make sacrifices
for a paycheck and to keep my career going.''
   Harrison and his wife, Randi, have two children, and a third on
the way. In ``The Family Man'' he has four.
   ``I'm trying to be father and mother to the family,'' he says,
``and pretty much making a mess of things. Hopefully in a comedic
way. One of the things I like about the show is that it's more
grounded in sentiment and truth than most sitcoms I see.''
   Harrison not only grew up surfing but he grew up watching movies
being made.
   ``I was 15 when Doris Day and Rod Taylor came to Catalina to
make `The Glass Bottom Boat,''' he says. ``It was the most
thrilling day of my life. Arthur Godfrey ran the boat, which was my
father's boat.
   ``Marlon Brando and Yul Brynner came to Catalina for `Morituri,'
about a ship in World War II. I watched Marlon like a hawk. I had
no idea then that I'd ever be an actor. I was just fascinated. My
father was hired to bring the cast out to the freighter every day.
He did his tours in between.''
   Harrison's first series was the science fiction ``Logan's Run''
in 1977. ``I watched it the other day on cable,'' he says.
   ``My wife said, `It's you, or at least I think it's you.' I
thought it was so sophisticated. Then `Star Wars' came out. It made
us look like the 1930s `Buck Rogers' serial.''

   In the fragile world of the ingenue, Danielle
and Deanna Duclos seem to have found the solution to aging. The
young sisters play the same person in Andrew Lloyd Webber's
``Aspects of Love.'' At different ages.
   As young Jenny Dillingham, the look-alikes have the audience
befuddled.
   Danielle, 15, says, ``You hear stories of people going out
saying, `How did they do that? They must have stretched her legs
out.' ''
   Deanna, 11, has a six-month contract, renewable if she doesn't
grow too much. Her fingers are crossed. She can still get into her
costume.
   They ``kind of did it together'' when it came to shaping the
personality of Jenny.
   ``The character at Deanna's age is just a tomboy,'' Danielle
says. ``When I first come on, I'm still that tomboy but I undergo
kind of a transformation... I'm realizing I'm becoming a woman.''
   The sisters auditioned for ``Aspects of Love'' separately,
several times. ``I got it before they finished casting for the
younger Jenny,'' Danielle says. She tried to help her sister get
the role ``because we go well together.''
   Danielle auditioned for ``Annie'' years ago. ``I wasn't right
for an orphan,'' she says. ``I don't sing that way. They wanted you
to scream your lungs out.''
   The sisters, making their first appearance on Broadway, share
long and wavy hair that softly frames their faces. They braid it to
keep it from tangling while they sleep.
   Danielle's favorite movie role was as Robert DeNiro's daughter
in ``Midnight Run.'' ``He was a bounty hunter who had to get to Los
Angeles by a deadline,'' she says. ``I didn't have a huge part but
the scenes I was in were considered the most poignant ones. I
hadn't seen my father since I was 7 and he came back.''
   ``I think `Signs of Life' was the most fun,'' Deanna says. ``We
played two of four sisters. Beau Bridges was the father. This
family was poor so the daughters helped around the house.''
   Danielle adds, ``The father robs a hardware store because the
boatyard where he works is closing. Our characters had to deal with
that.''
   Danielle also played Paul Newman's daughter in ``Fort Apache,
the Bronx.'' Deanna was in ``Lorean,'' with Jerry Hall's sister
Rozy playing her older sister.
   Danielle started modeling at age 3 and branched out to
commercials, jingles, singing backup on recordings and acting.
Deanna was ``discovered'' in her mother's arms and photographed for
the cover of Psychology Today magazine at the age of 6 weeks. She
became a model at 4.
   Deanna at 8 joined the children's chorus at the Metropolitan
Opera. Her favorite opera is ``Werther'' and her goal is to be a
star _ an opera star.
   Their mother, Karol Duclos, a photographer, goes with them to
and from the theater. They have separate dressing rooms but Deanna
admits shyly, ``I visit Danielle a lot.''
   Both attend professional children's school, which allows
flexible scheduling. Deanna will be in the sixth grade in the fall.
Danielle, who'll be a high school junior, wants to study drama at
Northwestern University.
   ``I'm thinking of going one semester at a time and taking off
and doing projects,'' Danielle says.
   ``I kind of expected it would be very exciting working on
`Aspects of Love.' It has been wonderful. You learn a lot. You
change so much. You think, `Who was I before?'''

   Twenty-five years ago, a trainee nun took up
with the Trapp family and started a love affair with movie-goers
that has enchanted generations.
   ``The Sound of Music'' made its theatrical debut in 1965,
starring Julie Andrews as Maria the spirited governess and
Christopher Plummer as Baron Von Trapp. The story of their romance
and flight from the Nazis grossed more than $57 million over a
record 4{-year run.
   CBS-Fox Video is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Robert
Wise film with a special remastered special edition, which includes
an interview with Wise who won an Academy Award for his effort.
   The Rodgers and Hammerstein musical also was re-released
theatrically by 20th Century Fox on Aug. 24 in New York and Los
Angeles only.
   The Oscar-winning movie, which won best picture, sound, scoring
and editing, is part of a special CBS-Fox collection of Rodgers and
Hammerstein musicals. They include: ``The King and I,'' ``State
Fair,'' ``South Pacific,'' ``Carousel'' and ``Oklahoma!''
   The videos will be available at retail outlets on Sept. 13.
   ``The Sound of Music'' has a suggested retail price of $24.98
and is rated G. The other five videos are priced at $19.98.
   In other video news, one of the best jazz biographies of all
time is available on video. ``Satchmo: Louis Armstrong,'' which had
been shown on the PBS ``American Master Series,'' captures the
great trumpeter in some of his rare and classic performances from
the early 1930s to the '60s.
   There are also charming home movies and footage from his 1935
club act in Chicago.
   There are poignant moments and musical and personal times to be
treasured.
   Armstrong's own words lace this video love letter and are spoken
by filmmaker Melvin Van Peebles. The video also includes interviews
with Tony Bennett, Dexter Gordon, Dave Brubeck and Lester Bowie,
among others.
   And the soundtrack has some wonderful cuts of ``All of Me,''
``When You're Smiling,'' ``Mack the Knife,'' ``On the Sunny Side of
the Street,'' ``Heebie Jeebies'' and ``Potato Head Blues.''

   ``Rise &amp; Shine'' (IRS) _ John Kay &amp; Steppenwolf
   John Kay may never produce another song to match the
freedom-breathing glory of ``Born to Be Wild.'' But he hasn't
stopped trying.
   The new Steppenwolf album, ``Rise &amp; Shine,'' is like a postcard
from a forgotten friend. It's not a work of fine art, but it
delivers effectively enough Kay's message that adulthood is no
excuse for compromising on youthful ideals.
   It would be easy to dismiss Kay as just another 1960s act
capitalizing on his appeal to baby boomers. But Steppenwolf wasn't
just another pop band. Their music was as political as it was
psychedelic, and Kay is still a social critic.
   Twenty years ago, he condemned drug dealers in ``The Pusher''
and railed against political apathy in ``Monster.''
   On this album, he's trying to raise his listeners' environmental
consciousness on ``Do or Die'' and lashing out slyly at the
national addiction to debt in ``Sign on the Line.''
   The title track becomes a plea for social activism as Kay
recalls his own reawakening: ``I've been searching for the man I
used to be. I found him waiting, alive and well, and he was
screaming back at me: `Rise and shine.'''
   The album hits its most topical point on ``The Wall,'' in which
Kay first tells the story of his childhood escape from East Germany
with his mother, then rejoices at seeing the Berlin Wall torn down
late last year.
   The 10 cuts on ``Rise and Shine'' lack the psychedelic sound of
the original Steppenwolf, although Kay still has that voice, an
animal growl that remains one of rock's most distinctive sounds.
Most of the tunes are modern-sounding, straight-ahead rockers that
allow the three-man band _ none of them original Steppenwolf
members _ to work out. Guitarist Rocket Ritchotte is an ace.

   ``Tangled'' (EMI) _ Jane Wiedlin
   Jane Wiedlin was largely responsible for everything that was
good about the Go-Gos. On ``Tangled,'' her second solo project, she
improves vastly upon that.
   The 10 selections, nine of them co-written by Wiedlin with
others, lean toward bouncy, guitar-driven pop with engaging female
harmonies that recall such 1980s Go-Gos hits as ``Our Lips Are
Sealed'' and ``We've Got the Beat.''
   But the songs on ``Tangled'' are more complex and varied. No two
tracks sound alike, perhaps because no two were written by the same
team.
   Love is a common theme on the album. But love has many faces and
Wiedlin takes a good look at a number of them.
   The title track is about the tangled emotions that arise when a
love goes bad but the need for love remains.
   Wiedlin explores the other side of the coin in ``Big Rock Candy
Mountain,'' in which a woman jaded by too many heartbreaks can
hardly believe it when she finally finds the real thing.
   ``World on Fire,'' the first single from the album, is a
playful, pumped-up scorcher that contains the memorable line, ``I
feel the flames of love climbing up my pantyhose.''
   And ``Paper Heart,'' a moving ballad by Wiedlin and Cyndi
Lauper, is about the pain of seeing a beloved friend changed and
consumed by drug addiction.
   ``Tangled'' is a solid release that sounds better with each
listening. Wiedlin is an artist to watch in the '90s.

   Crooning and shrieking, he ignites flash paper
with a cigarette-smoking skull named Henry and flings it over the
audience.
   It's been four decades since Screamin' Jay Hawkins began his
stage antics that led to the shock rock of Kiss and Alice Cooper.
   ``I don't know if I'll be alive next week to go this crazy,''
Hawkins tells the packed Lone Star Roadhouse, his fingers full of
skull rings, a rubber snake and boar's tooth around his neck. A
bone was clipped to his nose.
   He just turned 61 in mid-July. But you wouldn't know it when the
youthful wild man bangs ``I Put a Spell on You'' on the piano, his
eyes ablaze from under an Afro-pompadour. His voice ranges from a
smooth operatic baritone to a wail, a cluck, a grunt.
   Dressed in a black and purple batik suit, he beats a plastic
bone on the piano and maneuvers a large fur-and-rubber tarantula
that hops on a motorized rubber hand curling its fingers.
   To howls of delight from an audience half his age, Hawkins gives
a brief revival-style rap sermon on love and censorship.
``Nothing's risque except a damn lie,'' he said during the recent
concert. ``If you get weak in your hips, you get strong in your
lips.''
   The next day he did it again to about 3,000 people in Central
Park.
   Hawkins has been riding high lately. After appearing in last
year's Jim Jarmusch film ``Mystery Train,'' he came out with a new
greatest hits album this year. In June, he and his band began
another tour and he married a young woman from Japan, where he is a
celebrity in Sony commercials.
   ``Spell,'' a demented blues waltz written to woo back a
girlfriend, is his biggest hit. It was banned by some radio
stations when it first came out in the 1950s because it supposedly
sounded cannibalistic, Hawkins said in an interview.
   Hawkins combines his own demented blues and rock 'n' roll songs
with off-beat renditions of such campy old tunes as Cole Porter's
``I Love Paris.''
   ``I don't sing them. I destroy them,'' he said in his hotel room
before the Central Park show, dressed down in jeans, a camouflage
T-shirt and cowboy boots.
   During gigs, he nearly destroyed himself. Hawkins has seriously
burned himself several times when using exploding fuse boxes on
stage.
   He used to climb out of a coffin during his acts _ something
George Clinton of the funk group Parliament later did.
   But Hawkins leaves the casket at home now, saying he used it
because he was bribed by Alan Freed, his former promoter and
Cleveland disc jockey credited with coining the term ``rock 'n'
roll'' in the 1950s. He credits Freed with his success.
   How much stage persona does Screamin' Jay take offstage?
   ``All of it,'' Hawkins said lying on his hotel bed, igniting
flash paper with a gun-shaped lighter and throwing it in the air.
It flared up and disappeared without a cinder three feet above his
head.
   Once he says he fired blanks out a Philadelphia hotel window
across from a church wedding, screaming in a woman's falsetto to
the bridegroom, ``How could you leave me with all these children?''
   He has long remained a cult hero among rock 'n' roll fans in the
United States, Europe and Japan. But his popularity rose after
``Spell'' was featured in the 1984 Jarmusch film ``Stranger Than
Paradise.''
   In ``Mystery Train,'' he played the red-suited night clerk of a
shabby Memphis hotel haunted by Elvis Presley's ghost.
   Hawkins' latest album, ``Voodoo Jive: The Best of Screamin' Jay
Hawkins,'' was released by Rhino Records. In addition to ``Spell,''
it includes ``Frenzy,'' ``Alligator Wine'' and ``Constipation
Blues.''
   His latest tour was scheduled to end in Norway on Aug. 11, after
which he was to tour Japan and make more Sony commercials.
   A hard-living man of a thousand tales, he says he was born
Jalacy Jay Hawkins in Cleveland on July 18, 1929, to a prostitute
who left him at an orphanage. He says he was adopted by a wealthy
Blackfoot family that taught him Indian culture.
   ``That's how I wound up in this macabre-like, metaphysical cult
signs and voodoo thing. I use a lot of roots; I eat everything with
garlic,'' he says as he points to a plastic garlic shaker and a jar
of yucca pills he takes for arthritis.
   He says that during the shooting of ``Mystery Train,'' the rain
that interrupted filming stopped after he rolled a red bag of bones
that includes iguana ribs, a hand and one of his teeth. Jarmusch
spokeswoman Birgit Staudt confirmed the episode.
   Hawkins says the Blackfoot family also bought him expensive
clothes and had him tutored in classical music. His greatest love
is opera, which he says inspired his stage antics.
   ``I wanted to come dressed like a Viking, walking down the steps
and rescue the damsel in distress, save her from the wicked
landlord, saying `Don't worry, I'll pay your rent,' '' he sings at
full volume.
   ``I watched enough Mario Lanza,'' he said of the famed opera
singer. ``I took that and sax and combined it into screamin'
instead of singin'.''
   Hawkins says the fancy duds the Blackfoot family bought him
caused other kids at school to pick on him until he learned how to
fight and joined a gang. His 6-foot-plus frame later lent itself to
part-time professional boxing.
   After his several brushes with the law, his guardians lied about
his age and enlisted him in the Army during World War II.
   Hawkins says he got started singing professionally in Atlantic
City, N.J., in 1950, and picked up his ``screamin' '' moniker that
year when playing a gig in Nitro, W.Va., where a woman yelled
``scream baby, scream!''
   In the 1960s and early '70s Hawkins lived mainly in Hawaii,
spending a couple of years in London. In the 1970s, he played at
New York's famous Apollo Theater in Harlem. Since 1985, he has
lived in the San Fernando Valley of Southern California.
   Hawkins says he wants to retire but doesn't know yet when he
will.
   And he's not saving a coffin for his funeral.
   ``I wrote in my will to cremate me ... fly over the ocean and
scatter the dust so I can be little particles in everybody's eyes _
drive everybody crazy the rest of their lives,'' he said.

   When Gretel Ehrlich irrigates her fields of
hay and wildflowers, she slips her tiny notebook into a plastic bag
and tucks it in her back pocket.
   With pen clamped to her T-shirt and shovel in hand, she hikes up
the hill behind her rock ranch house to divert channels of water
flowing from the jagged Big Horn Mountains.
   ``The setting here is provocative, or evocative,'' said the
author, who has gained increasing prominence as a Western writer
since she wrote the ``Solace of Open Spaces'' in 1985, a collection
of essays about ranch life in Wyoming.
   ``I think of the landscape as my laboratory in a sense, except
the landscape is doing its experiment on me and not the other
way,'' said Ehrlich. ``I am its humble student of violent weather,
endless drought, wild diversity, surprising and profound beauty _
almost impossible to calculate.
   ``Mountain lions, bearcats, foxes and eagamily pride all tied
into one. So they meet each year to live in tents, with only the
barest of essentials, to celebrate their dedication to God. They
are the offspring of pioneers, remembering the way it was a century

   SHILOH, Miss. _ Each year they come with their Bibles and
bedding, cooking utensils and Methodist hymnals, food for the body
and sustenance for the soul.
   And as they gather in late summer for the Shiloh Camp Meeting, a
throwback to the days of Methodist circuit-riding preachers,
someone is sure to tell the story of how it began more than 150
years ago.
   Here in the piney woods of south-central Mississippi, church
history relates, a wagon train stopped at a cool spring, a needed
rest for the wandering Protestant pioneers and their oxen and their
slaves. The journey along wilderness trails out of the back country
of South Carolina had been arduous and the prairie of Texas was
still a long way off.
   During the pause at the spring, the story goes, a young girl
whose name has been lost wandered into the woods to play. Swinging
on a grapevine, she fell and broke her neck.
   Delayed by a day for a proper Christian burial, which was
watched from a distance by a group of curious Choctaw Indians,
several of the families decided that these gentle, wooded hills
offered as good a place as any to start a new life.
   The year was 1828.
   As the wagon train pushed on, the lingering families began
felling the ample pine trees to build cabins and a church, which
they named Shiloh for the church they had left behind in the
Orangeburg District of South Carolina.
   Four years later they held their first camp meeting, a
convenience for frontier preachers on horseback who served widely
scattered congregations.
   To this day the descendants of those original settlers _ mostly
of German, Scottish and Scottish-Irish stock _ return to Shiloh
each August for 10 days of concentrated old-time religion.
   They share a sense of history, family pride, a love of the
Methodist tradition.
   Shiloh, which for years was called the ``Dutch Colony'' because
of the Germanic background of many of its settlers, is located
about 8 miles south of the town of Pelahatchie. It's still little
more than a settlement, with a church and cemetery and an
open-sided tabernacle surrounded on three sides by crude, weathered
cabins they call tents.
   The tents have no windows, only vents to open to the air. Until
recent years they had no floors. Sawdust sufficed, as it still does
on the front porches and in the aisles of the tabernacle.
   There is no air-conditioning, no television, no radios. The
campers would have it no other way.
   At mid-afternoon on a recent day, during a break in the prayer
meetings and worship services that go on from morning until well
into the night, the campers have taken refuge from the 95-degree
heat in the shade of their sawdust front porches. This is a time
for visiting relatives (most of them are kin in one way or
another), gossiping and shelling beans for the evening meal. Some
kids are shooting baskets outside the tabernacle.
   Mrs. Katherine Varner, the attractive mother of a 12-year-old
daughter and 7-year-old son, is sitting alone reading. The wife of
a Jackson business executive, she says she has not missed a camp
meeting since she was 2 months old.
   Not one?
   ``That's unheard of,'' she says. ``This is better than
Christmas. Christmas is just one day. This is 10 days.''
   Mrs. Willa Dean Perkins, one of the women shelling butterbeans
they had picked from their gardens that morning, says she has
missed only one camp meeting in all her 70 years. That was 38 years
ago when her husband's job took them too far away.
   That's not a record, either. They say Mrs. Mabel Sowell, the
church historian, has a perfect attendance record of 80 years, but
she was away this day tending an ailing sister in Meridian.
   How do the chldren feel about it?
   ``They wouldn't miss it for anything,'' Mrs. Varner says.
   Since her home is only a few miles away, close enough to commute
to the services, why would Mrs. Varner subject herself and her
family to the deprivations of the spartan cabins?
   ``Until you sleep with sawdust in your bed, you haven't
experienced it,'' she says. ``It's hard to express the feelings I
have.''
   At 3 p.m. the church bell peals, summoning the campers to the
afternoon service. The butterbeans and basketballs are put away and
the porches empty as the campers file into the tabernacle.
   Down a slope in a clump of woods behind the tents is the clear
spring that is the wellspring of the Shiloh settlement. The spring
is still in use today, shielded by a gazebo and surrounded by a
garden.
   Those early emigrants from South Carolina were said to be
fleeing political turmoil brought on by that state's defiance of
federal law, a defiance that eventually led to secession from the
Union. The Rev. M.R. Jones, writing 100 years later, said:
   ``When the legislature of that state passed what was called the
Nullification Act, nullifying some of the laws of Congress, many of
the citizens of the state became apprehensive that there would be
serious trouble with the United States government. Therefore, many
of the South Carolians sold out their possessions, loaded their ox
wagons, and started westward...''
   Some of the pioneers dropped out of the wagon train in Alabama.
After the accident at the spring, the Kersh, Rhodes and Myers
families decided to stay here in what is now Rankin County. They
would be joined later by the Colliers, Martins, Nobles, Traxlers
and others. The wagon train continued on to Arkansas and Texas.

   The Osborne Brothers of the Grand Ole
Opry worry about the demise of bluegrass music, which they helped
popularize during the past 30 years.
   Bobby and Sonny Osborne, best known for their bluegrass standard
``Rocky Top,'' fear that the acoustic music will not be kept alive
by the next generation of instrumentalists.
   ``The kids just aren't trying,'' Sonny Osborne, 52, said in an
interview in his dressing room at the Grand Ole Opry House. ``The
players are still the same ones as 15 years ago. You have to invest
time to learn what it takes.''
   Says brother Bobby, 58, ``No one is coming along that has the
talent, the know-how. They can't think for themselves; they just
imitate others. It's OK to imitate, but you must get something
going for yourself.''
   There are exceptions, Bela Fleck being among the most notable.
His banjo emerged from bluegrass roots and crossed into jazz, new
age and funk. The bluegrass roots are there but becoming more and
more obscured.
   If the music of guitars and banjos and fiddles does die, it
won't be because of lack of effort by the brothers. They have
helped expose bluegrass music far beyond their birthplace of Hyden,
Ky., a mountainous coal mining region.
   They are now celebrating their 26th anniversary on the Opry, a
live country music show seen and heard by millions in person and
via TV and radio.
   Their 1968 hit ``Rocky Top'' is a classic in the bluegrass
field. In 1971, they were voted best vocal group by the Country
Music Association _ the last bluegrass act to win the award.
   Along with Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs, they helped spread
bluegrass on college campuses in the 1960s. At the invitation of
then President Richard Nixon, they performed at the White House in
1973 in what is believed to be the first such performance there.
   They have made several tours of foreign countries and were among
the first country music acts to perform in a main casino showroom
in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
   Bobby, a mandolinist, and Sonny, a banjoist, are self-taught
musicians. They made their recording debut on a major label in
1956, with Bobby singing in an impressive high lead tenor voice and
Sonny singing baritone.
   ``We found a little niche with our harmony,'' Bobby said after a
recent Opry performance.
   These days, when not singing and playing on the Opry, they
perform at about 60 bluegrass festivals a year and on cruises to
Mexico every winter. The festivals are especially popular with
bluegrass fans, whose loyalty to the music can be intense.
   ``The people plan their vacations around them,'' Sonny Osborne
said. ``The festivals are like a big reunion where you make friends
and so forth. And so many people can play the music after the show.
They go to the campgrounds and sit and play all night. And you
don't need any amps (amplifiers) to hook up to.
   ``Plus the parents can take their kids and turn 'em loose.
There's not a bunch of drunks around.''
   They are concerned about the future of their music because of
what they feel is a lack of national exposure.
   Bluegrass music is rarely heard on radio and not often played on
television, even ``Hee Haw.'' The Nashville Network, a cable TV
station with programming based on country music, does not have a
strictly bluegrass show. A gospel music show was added in the past
year _ but not bluegrass.
   The top singers in country music such as Randy Travis and George
Strait are not bluegrass oriented. Others, such as Ricky Skaggs,
had to set aside their bluegrass style and switch to traditional
country music in order to be accepted by the country music
mainstream.
   The Opry has more than 60 regular performers _ but only a
half-dozen are bluegrass oriented.
   Bluegrass also has been hurt because it has been dominated by
men _ Bill Monroe, Flatt, Scruggs and others.
   While country music has provided women role models such as
Loretta Lynn and Reba McEntire, bluegrass has provided none with
the possible exception of Emmylou Harris.
   ``The whole situation bothers me a great deal,'' Sonny Osborne
said. ``There just isn't a new generation coming along.''
   Aside from the lack of radio play for bluegrass, Sonny said
there's also not very much bluegrass being written. ``Bluegrass
also is hurt because you're restricted to just certain
instruments,'' he said.
   Bobby Osborne hopes the Opry will help the matter.
   ``The Opry has done a lot for bluegrass music,'' he said.
``Maybe they can find some new groups that would be good for the
Opry and bluegrass music.''

   ``Ernest Hemingway: The Man and the Myth''
is the topic of a four-day conference to be held this fall at
Washington University in St. Louis.
   The conference, scheduled for Oct. 17-20, will address the
Hemingway mystique.
   Barbara Jones, co-organizer of the conference and film studies
professor at Washington University, says, ``Although there have
been numerous conferences focusing on Hemingway the novelist, this
will be the first to examine Hollywood's impact on Hemingway's
private life and his creativity.''
   The conference, which is sponsored by the university's
Performing Arts Department, will feature the world premiere of
Hemingway's only play, ``The Fifth Column.''

   The world premiere of a drama written in
part by the authors of the Broadway hits ``Mame'' and ``Inherit the
Wind'' will open in Arizona this fall.
   ``Whisper in the Mind,'' a play by Norman Cousins, Jerome
Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, will have its first performance Oct. 4
at the Nelson Fine Arts Center at Arizona State. The play will be
directed by six-time Tony Award-nominee Marshall Mason, founder of
the Circle Repertory Company in New York.
   Lawrence and Lee received a Tony nomination for ``Mame'' and are
also the playwrights of ``The First Monday in October,'' ``Auntie
Mame'' and ``The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail.''
   The play is based on the life of Franz Anton Mesmer, an Austrian
physician who fled to France after being denounced as a charlatan
for his method of using hypnotism in treatment. It centers on a
confrontation between Benjamin Franklin, the epitome of the Age of
Reason, and Mesmer, challenger of the status quo.
   ``Whisper in the Mind'' will kick off the art complex's second
full season with 12 performances beginning Oct. 4. The center
landed the premiere after Mason visited the complex last year.

   A Frank Lloyd Wright exhibition now on
tour will be duplicated for Japan.
   The exhibit, ``Frank Lloyd Wright: In the Realm of Ideas,'' is
on display in San Diego through Sept. 30. It returns to Scottsdale
in December and then will go to a recently authorized ninth city _
Madison, Wis. _ minus Wright's Usonian Automatic House.
   A duplicate exhibition including one of the Usonian houses will
be produced and presented in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan, according to
an agreement between Delphi Research Inc., a Japanese firm, and the
exhibition's sponsors: the Scottsdale Cultural Council and the
Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation.
   Council president Frank Jacobsen said the Japanese will spend
about $1 million to duplicate the entire exhibit. Council and
foundation officials will supervise.
   ``Usonian'' stands for Wright's vision of a utopian United
States. The structures designed during the 1930s and '40s were to
demonstrate simple functionality without neglect of aesthetic
features central to his concept of organic architecture _ building
in harmony with natural surroundings. The 1,800-suqare-foot house
accompanying the exhibit was designed in 1945 but wasn't built
until three years ago.
   However, the Usonian house the Japanese will build inside the
new Tokyo Art and Cultural Center will be smaller than was
exhibited in the United States _ a one-bedroom, one-bath model.
   Total costs for the U.S. tour, which began in Dallas in 1987,
are about $2.3 million, which included materials, construction and
transportation of the Wright house and exhibit materials. The
exhibit also has appeared in Washington, Chicago, Bellevue, Wash.,
and San Rafael, Calif.

   Some electronic gadgets just make life easier,
from microwave ovens that zap supper to fax machines for ordering
junk food.
   Some gizmos make life more enjoyable, such as the Walkman,
Watchman and video games that fit in the palm of the hand.
   Some save lives, such as pacemakers that keep hearts beating in
rhythm and laser beams that allow bloodless surgery.
   Some offer protection, from the wizardry of national defense
sensors to personal security alarms that ward off burglars.
   Some, like computers, do things that nothing else can.
   Whatever, it's hard to imagine life without electronics. They
are to modern living what the earliest flickers of fire were to
evolving humans _ a means to cook, get warm, find safety, defeat
the darkness, signal others and allow groups to gather.
   ``There's no aspect of our life that is not touched by
electronics even if we do not own the product. They've made our
lives easier, enhanced lifestyles and made us healthier,'' said
Mark Rosenker of the Electronics Industries Association, a
Washington-based trade group.
   ``With each and every one of these enhancements, you can't
believe you ever did without it,'' Rosenker said.
   On the down side, they do raise expectations. Getting something
there overnight just won't do anymore. It has to be faxed
instantaneously or sent by electronic mail.
   And, confound it, electronics don't necessarily make life
simpler. Just ask anyone who's had a computer system crash from a
bugaboo. Computers can even catch a virus, and please make sure no
one pulls the plug.
   The electronic age has beamed a revolution into the home.
Microwaves heat water for instant coffee at breakfast and, with
push-buttoned planning, can automatically cook supper.
   The TV, now in stereo and soon to be high definition, flashes
instant news and entertainment from signals bounced off
globe-circling satellites to dish-shaped receivers. Remote control
negates the need to flip dials.
   VCRs retrieve what was on too late to watch the night before or,
with a rental tape, become movie projectors. The popcorn comes from
the microwave, of course.
   How we talk to others has also changed dramatically. There's
call waiting, call forwarding and call conferencing. Machines will
answer if you're not around. New phones can dial numbers on voice
command.
   Need freedom while talking? There are cordless phones and
portable cellular phones, which fit in the car or can simply be
carried around.
   No need anymore to yell for the kids. Just beep them on digital
pagers. Once the domain of doctors, lawyers and the self-important,
pagers are ubiquitous. Even the criminal element _ drug dealers,
prostitutes and bookies _ have prospered by their wizardry.
   And, shades of Dick Tracy, the new ones fit on the wrist.
   Remember the fax-less days? Now your personal facsimile can
order at McDonald's, send in a food order to the grocery store,
request a song on a radio station and, oh, yes, send business
documents and news releases.
   The home computer has more memory and more power to figure taxes
and keep bank records. Use it as a word processor and kiss the
typewriter goodbye.
   Laptop computers and office organizers give executives a jump
start to the business day before they get to the office.
   High-tech gadgets open and close the garage door and trigger
burglar alarms. If those burglars are caught and aren't dangerous
enough to be in jail, they may serve their sentence wearing an
electronic bracelet monitored by police.
   You don't have to be a geezer to remember when cars were started
with hand cranks. Now they come to life with electronic ignitions,
and computer chips tell a car how much gas to burn and how evenly
the brakes are applied.
   Radar helps the cops catch speeders; radar detectors help
speeders elude the cops.
   Sensors turn on street lights at dusk and shut them off at dawn.
   You can bank by machine, pay bills, get cash, transfer money.
   Forget record albums. Now there's compact discs and digital
audio tape.
   Nintendo video games turn TVs into arcades. There are hand-held
versions that fit in the palm of the hand for entertainment on the
hoof. Some even convert into portable TVs.
   Remember arithmetic with pencil and paper? Now the calculator is
where it's at as the slide rule becomes as quaint as the abacus.
   There are other intrusions in education. College courses now
come on VCR tapes.
   Even the sports world is electronic. Instant replays govern
football games and radar guns measure the speed on a pitcher's
fastball.
   It hasn't been all that long since the dawn of the Electronic
Age in 1883, when Thomas Edison controlled the flow of electrons
through a light bulb.
   Now its growth seems to be stuck on fast forward. The U.S.
electronics industry is worth about $285 billion a year, almost
triple what it was just 10 years ago.
   And electronics has made the world a smaller place. Even
totalitarian governments know what they can do. In China, students
used electronic mail and fax machines to tell the truth about
Tiananmen Square.
   ``You can't close down a society anymore. Once people have
access to these things, it makes it much harder to shut off their
minds,'' said Sara Kiesler, professor of social and decision
sciences at Carnegie-Mellon University.
   And she also said parents shouldn't worry too much if their
children prefer to use calculators instead of working out problems
manually.
   ``We tend to cling to old ways. Younger people think if a
machine can do it, it's a waste of time to do it by hand,'' Kiesler
said. ``They're saying, `why bother to rub sticks together when you
can strike a match.' ''

   With compact discs becoming the format of choice for playback of
pre-recorded albums and singles, there is a new wave of players
ready to catch the eyes and ears of dedicated audiophiles.
   Most major electronics manufacturers are now marketing compact
disc changers to satisfy the appetites of those who hunger for
hours of uninterrupted digital sound.
   The two most popular versions of CD changers are the magazine
and carousel styles.
   Most CD magazines hold up to six discs, which are loaded and
stored horizontally. Once loaded, the magazine is inserted into the
player and each disc is then pulled from the magazine and
individually played.
   Carousel changers, on the other hand, hold five discs on one
large platter. A merry-go-round-like disc tray rotates to the
pickup mechanism to play the CD.
   Regardless of the make or style of the compact disc changer, the
end result is the same: hours of hassle-free listening.
   CD changers incorporate the same laser optics used in
single-disc players to read the information stored on the discs.
   CD changers cost more than many single-disc players, but don't
be frightened by the thought of paying a higher price for the
convenience of owning one. Shopping around can pay off, as dealers,
on occasion, will offer quality, brand-name changers on sale for
around $200.
   If you don't want to wait for a sale, then expect to pay $279 to
$400 for a changer.
   Like single-disc units, changers are also available with varying
degrees of ``frills.''
   Some carousel and magazine changers are available without remote
control and have to be programmed on the unit's front panel.
Eliminating the remote feature can save you a few dollars.
   But fully programmable changers packed with options are
attractive. Here's what most of them will do:
   After loading a changer with discs, it can be programmed to play
only the selections you want and in any order. Thanks to the laser
pickup and the way the digital recordings are stored, the changer
can go from one disc to another to find a song in a matter of
seconds. Most changers allow around 30 selections to be programmed.
   Some also offer selection memory and title file memory, so
favorite programs may be saved.
   Changers with a random play function allow the unit to pick and
play selections on its own. That feature is nice when listening to
group ``greatest hits'' CDs. It's like having a jukebox in your
home.
   Carousel changers are manufactured by Magnavox, Sony, Yamaha,
Technics, and Onkyo.
   Magazine-style changers are available from Pioneer, Magnavox,
Sanyo, Yamaha, Onkyo, and others.
   Some unique changers include the Yamaha CDC-500, which uses a
six-disc magazine and also has a tray for single-disc play.
   Sanyo's CPM 900 will hold up to 10 discs in its magazine, six
5-inch discs and four 3-inch discs.
   Fisher's DAC199 has five individual loading trays and can be
programmed to display disc titles on its lighted front panel.
   The SL-PC45 top-loading carousel changer from Technics allows
the user to insert discs while one is playing.
   Sharp's MV-D100 is a three-disc CD changer that also plays laser
videodiscs.
   Consumers also have found it handy to keep discs permanently
stored in the CD changer's magazines. You simply buy more magazines
to accommodate additional discs and build a library. Some of the
magazines also are compatible with auto CD changers.
   As with any stereo component, it is recommended that you give
prospective units a full in-store test before buying.

   The laser videodisc format is actually the big brother of the
compact disc and is continuing to grow in popularity among
audio-video enthusiasts.
   Though the concept of the optical-read disc has not changed in
its 11-year history, there have been some big quality advances.
   Today's laser videodisc players provide more than 400 lines of
horizontal resolution to complement large screen monitors. Most new
discs range from hit movies to music videos and also incorporate
true digital sound.
   And 1989 was a banner year for disc sales in the United States.
   Some of the popularity growth may be attributed to the
acceptance of the compact disc.
   What can this playback-only disc system do?
   Here's the lowdown on the laser videodisc format:
   Discs:
   They come in three sizes, 12, 8 and 5-inch. The 12-inch discs
feature hit movies, concerts, operas, and educational material.
They can contain up to 60 minutes of audio-video programming per
side.
   The 8-inch discs are usually music videos with up to 20 minutes
of programming per side.
   The 5-inch laser videodiscs are known as CDVs (compact disc
video) and are gold in color. They resemble standard CDs but are
able to hold up to 5 minutes of video along with 20 minutes of
audio. These discs are also devoted to music.
   Compact discs, which can be played on most current models of
laser videodisc players, are available in 3- and 5-inch sizes. The
5-inch disc can store up to 74 minutes of material and the 3-inch
disc up to 20 minutes.
   The price of laser videodiscs also make them attractive to
collectors of classic and hit movies. Many new releases on disc are
priced at under $30, whereas the same title on a tape may cost as
much as $90.
   Music videos cost even less with CDVs listing for about $10.
   Since these discs are read by a low-power laser beam, there is
no wear to them. With proper handling and storage, they should last
a lifetime.
   Players:
   Many leading hardware manufacturers currently offer laser
videodisc players. You can select from such names as Pioneer,
Magnavox, Yamaha, Sony, NEC, Mitsubishi, Sharp, and Philips.
Panasonic and Proton are expected to market players soon.
   All of the name-brand players are available as ``combi'' units.
They will play all of the optical disc formats from CDs to 12-inch
laser videodiscs (LDs).
   These combination players are available for about the price of
hi-fi VHS videocassette recorder.
   Pioneer also offers a lower-priced player for 8- and 12-inch
discs which has analog instead of digital audio circuitry.
   Players with all of the frills offer such features as two-sided,
two-disc playback and sing-along capabilities.
   How they work:
   I recently bought a new Pioneer CLD-1070, my third laser
videodisc player since becoming a charter member of the ``laser
camp'' in 1979.
   It's connected to a 27-inch Sony monitor and my stereo system,
which has a separate Dolby Surround processor-amplifier and rear
speakers.
   This ``combi'' player can do it all. The remote control allows
the user to program selected tracks from compact discs as well as
laser videodiscs encoded with ``chapter stops.''
   For instance, if I want to see a particular scene from ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark,'' the player can locate it in a matter of seconds.
   The player will also produce jitter-free freeze frame and slow
motion on selected discs.
   The picture provided by the laser videodisc is far sharper than
my HQ VHS deck. Colors are vivid and true and the picture is rock
solid.
   As for the sound, nothing compares to digital audio.
   It's a state-of-the-art component which makes the ``home
theater'' concept a reality.
   This deck, like most laser videodisc players, can be racked into
an audio-video system since it has a front-loading drawer.
   The player will automatically select the proper playing mode for
compact discs or the larger LDs. It also knows which big discs
contain digital soundtracks and will switch on the digital circuit.
   In scanning the current line-up of players, most have similar
features, so it's a matter of preference when making a purchase.
   Another important point about this high-quality format is that
many of the feature films being released may be purchased in the
``letterbox'' or widescreen format.
   Usually when a movie filmed for the widescreen comes to the home
tube, it is cropped in a process known as pan and scan. By cropping
the wide picture, it will fill up the entire television screen.
   But up to two-thirds of the picture may be lost in this process,
so the viewer is not seeing all of the action.
   By ``letterboxing'' a videodisc release, the picture is not
cropped. Instead, black bars are inserted on the top and bottom of
the programmed material and the original widescreen picture is left
intact.
   With disc production currently being increased and more strongly
backed by hardware manufacturers, the laser videodisc could prove
to be a powerful force in home entertainment in the 1990s.

   Ordinary consumers may want, need, and use home computers, but
not necessarily with all the complex gizmos that attract dedicated
hackers.
   So computer marketers aiming at this broad middle range group
have begun to concentrate on basic usefulness of the machines, with
word processing, school work, household management and
entertainment at the top of the list. They also are making them
easier to set up and use.
   After its initial flop with the PCjr in the home computer
marketplace, IBM scrambled to recoup by interviewing consumers
across the country about what they really want from a household
computer.
   The business computer giant re-entered the market this summer
with its PS@1 line, four compact models ranging in price from
$1,000 to $2,000 and dedicated to such prosaic functions as
homework, financial records, correspondence, and information
gathering and entertainment through software like Prodigy. The
computers have built-in modems that allow communication with other
PCs or information networks. Each computer, which can be bought at
department or computer stores, arrives with all components in one
box, ready to set up and go to work.
   Approaching from the other end of the market, Smith Corona, with
long experience in home-use typewriters, has come up with a line of
compact personal word processors.
   SCM word processors range from $500 to $900, with printers
costing an additional $200 or $300, depending on type. Included in
the line is the 6.5-pound PWP 7000LT, which the company says is the
first laptop personal word processor in the industry, with ports
for printers and modems to latch into on-line information services.
SCM also is marketing a line of electronic typewriters range from
$230 to $430, some with displays and keyboards similar to word
processors.
   IBM, looking at a 20 million-unit market that is expected to
double in five years, found that their potential consumers wanted
something relatively simple to set up and start with but didn't
skimp on more serious computing capabilities.
   ``Because it was developed to meet the expressed needs of
today's contemporary families, the computer has the potential to
become as necessary to the home as the microwave oven and as useful
as the VCR,'' says IBM's James Cannavino.
   Each IBM model features Microsoft Works and an IBM DOS operating
system, with Selectric Touch keyboard, Photo Graphic color or
black-and-white high resolution display, and a mouse. Powered by
Intel 80286 microprocessors, models offer options of either 512
kilobytes (KB) or 1 megabyte (MB) of memory. If more storage is
needed, users can add optional equipment such as a 3.5-inch
diskette drive, a 30 MB hard disk, or a 5.25-inch external disk
drive.
   The IBM machines open with an information quadrant graphic that
gets users into any of four capability modes: information for
tutorials and on-line help; Microsoft Works for word processing,
spreadsheets, databases and communications; storage for the users'
own software; and IBM DOS, the operating system with menu-driven
commands for functions such as copying and formatting.
   Users can pick from an array of on-line services including
Prodigy, for shopping, brokerage, banking and travel ticketing; the
PS@1 Users' Club, for on-line support, information and a users'
electronic bulletin board, operating through Prodigy; and
Promenade, an education and entertainment on-line service with
classes, tutoring, library and encyclopedia access and card and
board games. (Prodigy is IBM's joint venture with Sears.)
   SCM's machines are geared primarily to word processing with
built-in printing systems, though some of its models have separate
printers and are set up with Hayes compatible 1200 baud modems so
owners can plug into on-line networks.
   Desktop publishing capability is offered through SCM's
high-speed, high resolution transfer printer (HRT100), which can
print with a variety of characters and typefaces via plug-in
cartridges. The company also offers a letter-quality daisy-wheel
printer (DWP I).
   The portable laptop uses the latter. It also has 50,000
characters of editable internal memory and a built-in disk drive
with storage capacity of 100,000 characters per disk. Its display
is a 16-line backlit LCD board that flips up, and it can push
optional spreadsheet programs.
   The line features what SCM calls an entry-level word processor,
the PWP 1000. This portable machine comes an 8-line LCD and 32,000
characters of internal memory. It offers additional storage with an
optional 32,000 character DataStore Card. The machine features a
built-in address file and battery backup to hold records in case of
a power failure.
   Full screen monitors are featured on top-of-the line SCM models,
such as the PWP 5100, with a box-like monitor and printer combined;
the PWP 100c, with a printer-typewriter configuration; and the PWP
220, with separate keyboard, monitor and printer.

   The telephone has come a long way since the day in 1876 in
Boston when Alexander Graham Bell told his laboratory assistant
over a primitive liquid transmitter, ``Mr. Watson, come here; I
want you.''
   Today, that liquid transmitter has evolved into cordless phones,
tapeless digital answerphones, speakerphones, integrated telephone
answering machines, cellular phones, phones with autodialer memory,
on-hook dialing and voice dialing.
   Voice-dialing phones use voice logic sensor technology to allow
a user to dial any of 50 individual numbers by simply saying the
name of the person or business being called. The programmable phone
stores a voice print of each party's name and number in its memory,
so that when a name is announced, it automatically dials that
number.
   Some models have a built-in answering machine that greets
callers with a digitally-synthesized voice which asks them to dial
in their number so the call can be returned.
   Recently introduced by AT&amp;T are the first answering machines
that respond to rotary phones and voice responses. The two-line
models also are the first to answer calls on one line while taking
a message on the other.
   ``Now, answering machines can get their messages from virtually
any phone, anywhere in the world,'' explains Rob Davis, product
manager for the company's answering machines.
   ``For example, people vacationing at a mountain cabin or a shore
cottage with only a rotary telephone available won't have to jump
in the car and drive to the nearest pay phone to get their
messages.''
   Another recently marketed telephone is a hands-free headset
model which allows a person to listen to FM radio programs but to
answer calls with the touch of a button when the radio reception is
interrupted by an alerting tone.
   Digital technology has enabled engineers to do away with bulky
telephone answering systems and create compact and tapeless digital
answerphones designed for home use.
   With the absence of tape cassettes, the phones are approximately
the size of a standard telephone and have fewer working parts than
conventional answering machines.
   ``Digital recording puts an end to twisted tapes or overworked
parts which break or wear out,'' said a General Electric spokesman,
describing one of the company's models. ``With remote message play,
users can listen to their messages even when they are away from
home.
   ``The phone also features an LED message counter to quickly
display the number of calls received and has an auto-disconnect
function which automatically stops the outgoing message when any
phone in the house is picked up.''
   And for the traveler who wants to dial up the latest stock
prices or call for hotel and plane reservations, the New York
Telephone Company is testing new public computer terminals at New
York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. The company says
customers can access some 150 different travel, financial,
entertainment and information services available at the terminals,
which also are equipped for conference calling.
   ``Preliminary market studies tell us that many airline travelers
_ especially business people _ would use these types of services
frequently,'' says Robert Bellhouse, general manager-public
communications. ``This six-month test will provide use with more
definitive information on the level of market acceptance.''
   The access terminals include video displays, keyboards, and a
telephone handset and keypad.

   The fun end of computers and videos has become an separate
entertainment medium of its own. Some new twists:
   _ Sing-along laserdiscs. Laser Karaoke from Pioneer provides the
background orchestra, on-screen lyrics and mood images, and a mike
to croon into, in the home entertainment version of a songfest.
Karaoke means ``empty orchestra'' in Japan, where the form _
starting with cassettes with orchestral backings but no vocals _
has been popular for at least 15 years.
   Pioneer offers it as a feature on its laserdisc combination
players which can handle discs from a library of more than 500
songs, including current hits, Broadway show music, the
country-western genre, traditional and nursery tunes. There's also
a selection of Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Korean and Tagalog
songs.
   The equipment lets the singer override the vocals on most CDs
and all karaoke discs and even lets him adjust the pitch.
   _ Home colorization. You can enter the great colorization debate
on your own by colorizing your videos with the Video Equalizer from
Videonics. This machine includes a digital video enhancer, digital
video processor split-screen fucntion and three-channel audio
mixer. The unit's ``digital paintbrush'' will let you change color
of scene elements without affecting other colors or objects. You
also can ``sharpen'' images by removing noise or snow. And you can
add stereo music or voiceover narrations to the existing sound
track. _
   For game addicts, here comes something called U-Force Power
Games, a four-games cartridge to be used with the U-Force
hands-free controller for Nintendo.
   The system turns body motion into on-screen action without
attaching the player to wires, gloves, helmets, floor pads or
joysticks. Games on the cartridge include Power Field B-Ball, where
the player can dribble, drive and shoot with natural movements,
just as though he were on a real basketball court; Hose 'Em Down,
which lets the player direct rescue operations of a burning
building; the Nuclear Rat Attack, in which the player must fight
off thousands of nuclear-waste-eating rats attacking his space
ship; and Rock on Air, with the player creating music with a wave
of his hands. U-Force is from Broderbund. _

   A stitch in time these days may well be powered by a
microprocessor instead of a thimble.
   True, electronic sewing machines aren't for everyone, primarily
because of price. The occasional weekend sewer may find the $2,500
price tag on Singer's new Quantum XL-1 daunting.
   But for those who sew a lot for family and home, an old truism
still holds: any sewing machine will pay for itself many times over
in savings realized in the family clothing or decorating budget.
And the cost may be justified for anyone who values time and
versatility or hates sewing handwork.
   The Quantum, with computer-controlled thread supply, can thread
itself and do three kinds of buttonholes (keyhole and bartacks in
two weights) in one-step operations. It has over 190 built-in
stitches for construction, embroidery and lacework. These include
automatic script and block alphabets for monogramming and 20
embroidery design motifs. Singer says the machine will handle wider
stitch widths than any other machine, at a maximum 25 millimeters,
without attachments. And, like most modern machines, it will baste,
hem, and sew on buttons.
   These functions are controlled by an LCD display that shows what
stitch has been selected and the actual size of the pattern motif
being used. The touch-sensitive display gives operating
instructions and warns of problems. A display board shows
pictographs of all embroidery and monogram types. (Similar graphics
on the machine include the droll choice of tortoise or hare on the
speed control switch).
   The Quantum is technically portable, since it has a handle, but
the company says that most consumers with cabinetry for earlier
Singer models should be able to install the new machines in their
existing furniture _ specifically cabinet models 621 and 385, or
electric lift models 690, 691 and 692.
   This machine is the fifth generation of electronic machines
produced by Singer, which marketed its first, the Athena, in l975.

   Naturally, you want all the comforts of home in your car.
   Music. A telephone. A security system.
   Owners of Nissan's new luxury car, the Infiniti, can get audio
systems custom-tailored to its acoustic characteristics and blended
inobtrusively into the car's design.
   ``The design is based on the simple philosophy that the car's
music system is meant to be heard and not seen,'' says Jerry Firth
of the Bose OEM Division, which is supplying the systems.
   Available for the 1990 Infiniti Q45 four-door sedan and the
Infiniti M30 sports coupe, the audio systems feature digital
switching amplifiers built into each speaker enclosure. Two
4.5-inch HVC speakers in front and two 6.5-inch full-range speakers
in the rear are placed ot provide optimal stereo balance. An
electronically tuned radio-cassette player has automatic dynamic
noise reduction, Dolby B noise reduction, tape seek and scan,
treble and bass controls, push-button station selection and station
seek and scan.
   The cellular phone is the communication link for most motorists
today who can't bear to be out of touch while on the road. A
combination mobile, portable and transportable model from Audiovox,
CTX-5000, sits in its cradle and operates as a five-watter from the
car's electrical system. It becomes portable by disconnecting the
handset, which contains all the phone's electronic controls, from
the cradle. As a transportable, it attaches to a three-watt battery
pack for extended use in a boat, for camping or in another car.
   For those who would like not to have their Infinitis _ or even
their battered VWs _ stolen, there is the Prestige
remote-controlled auto security system, also from Audiovox. From as
far away as 100 feet, the key-ring remote controller can signal to
lock the car's doors, trunk and disable the starter. The owner can
use the controller to re-open the car when he returns.
   And if someone tries to break into the car, a high-wattage
electronic siren will sound. It will shut down automatically after
90 seconds but re-set for continued protection.

   Scientific research is about to blow the lid
off the mystery behind a common household horror: why thick soups
and stews explode and splatter the inside of microwave ovens.
   ``It's a consumer problem: the housewife or kid comes back and
here's lunch all over the inside of the microwave,'' said David W.
Cable, a mechanical engineer at MetriCor Inc. in Woodinville, Wash.
   MetriCor, a subsidiary of Corning Inc., sells $12,000 fiberoptic
sensors that are being used by Rutgers University scientists to
measure temperatures and pressures of food as it is cooked in
microwave ovens.
   He said the researchers want to know why some microwaved foods
splatter as they cook _ and how to prevent the messy problem.
   Cable, who is MetriCor's marketing and sales manager, presented
preliminary results of the study Wednesday during the annual
meeting of the Institute of Food Technologists, which drew more
than 15,000 food scientists to the Anaheim Convention Center.
   ``What causes cream of mushroom soup to attack the walls of a
microwave oven while chicken bouillon remains cautiously in its
bowl?'' the institute asked in a news release. ``Scientists are
coming close to an answer for that question.''
   Cable said a food being cooked in a microwave oven is injected
with microwave energy ``at a rate similar to lightning striking a
tree. The phenomenon is the same, except for its magnitude.''
   ``As water and sap (in a tree) flash to steam, the tree
literally explodes. ... This is what happens in the microwave to
foods that are trapping the steam.''
   Food scientists call the splattering phenomenon ``popping'' or
``bumping,'' Cable said.
   ``Some people have developed a sort of Richter scale of these
explosions,'' he said.
   Cable and the institute said that so far, the food-industry
sponsored study has provided the following solutions, some of which
may seem obvious:
   _Foods should be centered in the microwave because heat is more
evenly distributed there. The edges contain hot spots that are more
likely to make water in thick soups flash into exploding steam
bubbles.
   _Thicker soups are much more likely to splatter than thinner
liquids because heat concentrates more easily in a viscous liquid,
allowing steam bubbles to expand until they are large and create a
messy explosion.
   Cable suggested cooking thick soups or stews at lower power,
stirring them before putting them in the microwave oven, and
covering the cooking container with a paper towel to contain the
splattering.
   _If a cooking container contains ridges or some other rough
surface, bubbles can form more easily and in greater numbers. And
lots of small bubbles distribute heat more evenly, while a few
large bubbles are more likely to send the soup flying.
   The Rutgers study may result in improvements in packaging for
microwaveable foods, allowing them to be cooked with less mess,
Cable said.
   Cable acknowledged the research may seem silly, but said
consumers ``don't expect this nice clean package you put in your
microwave to come apart and throw food all over the inside.
   ``It's a cleanup issue, and we're all tidy Americans. We don't
like to be untidy.''

digitized speech box that plugs into the printer port with its own
amplifier and speaker. _
   Patterned after in-school book clubs, Scholastic Software has
launched a software club aimed at elementary through middle school
students and their families. Education and entertainment software
for Apple and MS-DOS computers will be available by mail through
order kits sent to their teachers, with 20 to 50 percent discounts.
The club program also will offer themed printer paper, memory
expansion boards and other computer accesories. _
   Software from Educational Testing Service may help you with the
S.A.T. and other tests along the educational path.
   ETS software already is available for grade school level
teachers and students. On the way are programs for higher level
tests, including those for professional registration.

   One of modern technology's more common items, the smoke
detector, is being ignored by many owners, often to their peril.
   Non-working smoke detectors contribute to as many as 6,000
fire-related deaths and 130,000 injuries each year, according to
Change Your Clock, Change Your Battery, a cooperative campaign
sponsored by the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the
American Burn Association and Eveready Battery Company.
   They hope that tying the ritual of time change on Oct. 28 with
the routine of changing batteries will increase the number of
working smoke alarms and emergency flashlights. The group estimates
that 50 percent of home smoke alarms now are useless because of old
or missing batteries. And without working flashlights, the
difficulty of locating safe, swift exits in night fire situations
increases.
   ``A yearly smoke detector battery change is the single most easy
and accessible way to make a difference in the number of
fire-related deaths and injuries,'' says Dave Hilton, president of
the IAFC. ``A working smoke detector can double the chances of
surviving a fire.''
   Besides this annual routine, checking the batteries with the
test button at least once a month is recommended.

   Computerized communications technology soon may be a factor in
the restaurant trade, says a market research firm.
   ``Whoever can hook up to that keyboard first, whether it's a
restaurant chain or deli, stands to benefit mightily,'' says Doreen
Zavada, vice president and general manager of CREST (Consumer
Reports on Eating Out Share Trends) division of the NPD Group, Inc,
a market research firm.
   Zavada says customers in the near future may be able to punch in
orders on their computer keyboards that will be piping hot in their
kitchens when they arrive home. Faxes and video tapes also may be
used to speed remote control shopping.
   Research was collected from about 12,800 households to determine
consumer trends affecting the restaurant business. _
   The typical PC owner has a median income of $42,000 and owns
many other electronic gadgets, according to HTI, a market research
group.
   Of 125,000 households polled, 27,000 have PCs and incomes well
above the $28,000 average for non-owners.
   PC owners are likely to have an answering machine (42 percent),
both cable and basic TV (37 percent) and compact disc players (28
percent). The study also indicates that the PC owner is 60 percent
more likely to own his or her own business and more than twice as
likely to own a fax machine or cellular telephone.
   ``We're finding out that PC owners are committed to new
technology and the convenience and entertainment it brings,'' says
Lynne Armstrong, the research group's president. _
   If you're concerned about all the juice you're using to run your
electronic gadgets or the environmental impact of disposables like
batteries, you might check into the Real Goods Trading Company's
catalog. Low power consumption lights, TVs and VCRs, rechargeables,
inverters, and alternative power sources, such as solar collectors,

   A fascimile machine in every American home in the
not-too-distant future is predicted by an executive for a New
Jersey-based electronics company.
   ``We tend to forget that it was once considered amazing when a

   ``The home fax will reach that level of acceptance one day, and
not too far off. People are using the fax in ways never dreamed of
when the machine was first introduced. We see college kids sending
messages home, vacationers writing letters on them.
   ``Who will be the first on the block with a home fax machine is
now a realistic question to ask.'' _
   A new process that can put a favorite photo or image on a
computer screen each time it is turned on has been developed by a
California high-tech firm.
   The company _ Integrated Concepts of Redding, Calif. _ says it
digitally translates the color or black-and-white photo onto a
database, then sends it back on a diskette to the customer with
simple instructions for loading the program. The file may also be
downloaded by modem.
   According to the company, the idea was first used by companies
which wanted their logotypes to appear on idle computer screens.
Later, images of family, friends, pets, works of art, vacation
scenes, fireplaces, sunsets, landscapes and ocean views began to be
used. _
   A ``clean'' humidifier that eliminates bacteria and viruses from
its mist and needs little maintenance is being marketed this fall
by Bionaire.
   The Clean Mist line uses a process called ``film boiling'' which
sterilizes the mist, then mixes it with filtered room air for an
uncontaminated mist only slightly above room temperature. The
company says these humidifiers also can be used as vaporizers, and
medication cups are included with each model. _
   Stereo sound has been added to the latest all-in-one
television-VCR combination from Gold Star Electronics. The 20-inch
KMV-2102 model features on-screen, eight-event, one-year
programming, an on-screen function display menu, bar graph picture
and a selection of cable-compatible channels. It has an MTS stereo
TV decoder with DBX noise reduction and Dolby noise reduction
systems, and a unified random access 43-key remote control. _

   The stock market rallied and oil prices eased as
the world's battered financial markets gained optimism that a
Middle East war had been averted _ at least for a while.
   But the recovery Friday was based more on a belief that stock
prices had bottomed out and oil prices shot up too rapidly over $31
a barrel than on the latest tense developments in the Iraq-U.S.
standoff.
   Traders termed Friday's action a chance to buy stocks at low
prices following a sharp drop in the Dow Jones industrial average
during the week.

   The U.S. economy grew at a sluggish annual

   The Commerce Department report Friday showed the gross national
product, the total output of goods and services, grew for the fifth
consecutive quarter at a pace below 2 percent. Many economists had
been looking for at least a small upward revision.

   Stock prices staged a strong rally today as
hopes increased for an orderly resolution of the showdown in the
Middle East.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials shot up 80.94 points to
2,614.36 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held an 11-1 advantage over losers in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,193 up, 106 down and
204 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 30.43 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the stage was set for the outburst of buying over
the weekend when fears of war in the Persian Gulf went unrealized.
   At the same time, many of the Street's chart-watchers argued
that stocks were ripe for a rebound after their steep drop since
mid-July.
   The market got some help from oil prices, which pulled back from
last week's highs, and the bond market, where interest rates fell.
   Brokers said investors also were heartened by conjecture that
the Federal Reserve had become increasingly willing to relax its
credit policy as recession worries intensified of late.
   Point-plus gainers among the blue chips included McDonald's, up
2 at 29\; Abbott Laboratories, up 1{ at 38}; General Electric, up 2
at 63&rsqb;, and Ford Motor, up 1~ at 36\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
jumped 4.37 to 175.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 3.13 at 319.42.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 49.50 to
2,532.92, finishing the week with a net loss of 111.88 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE.
   Big Board volume totaled 199.04 million shares, against 250.44
million in the previous session.

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States rose by 15 this week to 1,002, according to a
widely-followed index of drilling activity released Monday.
   The count had dropped by five a week ago after rising by 26 rigs
the previous week. A year ago this week, the count was 909, the
Houston-based oil toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. said Monday.
   Baker Hughes has kept track of the rig count since 1940. The
count represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not
those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, New Mexico led the gains list
by adding 10 new rigs, followed closely by Texas, which added nine.
   Other increases were posted in North Dakota and Oklahoma, each
of which added six, and Ohio, which added one rig.
   Kansas led the states posting declines with a loss of seven rigs
for the week, while Colorado and Pennsylvania each saw a loss of
five rigs.
   Of the other states posting a loss, California was down two,
while Louisiana, Michigan and Wyoming, which each lost a rig.

   The sales of Mediplex Group to Diamond Health Care Acquisition

   ``Avon now is entirely focused on beauty and direct sellling,
which are our heritage and our strength,'' Avon Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer James Preston said.
   The New York-based beauty products marketer accelerated a
program to concentrate on its core business, improve profitability
and trim debt last year in defending itself against unwanted
takeover offers.
   Avon said that at the closing it received about $40 million in
cash, excluding a working capital adjustment and additional
investments in Mediplex, plus a $40 million note to be repaid by a
bond issue that is scheduled to be completed within 60 days.
   The sale proceeds will be used to reduce Avon's debt, the
company said.
   In the past 20 months, Avon has cut its debt by about 40 percent
to less than $650 million from $1.13 billion.
   Diamond Health Care Acquisition Corp. and Diamond Health Care
Development Corp. are based in Waltham, Mass.

   Grain and soybean futures were lower in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders attribute the lower prices to the perception the crisis
in the Persian Gulf is easing.
   One trader notes that the tone for grain and soybean prices were
set by the New York commodity markets, where oil and precious
metals prices dropped sharply this morning.
   ``Deflationary forces are at work,'' said Victor Lespinasse of
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``The fear of war remains,
but it has abated somewhat.''
   Also pushing grain and soybean prices lower is the weather. Hot
and dry conditions prevail in the Midwest, ideal growing weather
for the corn and soybean crops.
   In early trading, wheat was 1\ cents to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.83\ a bushel; corn was a {
cent to 3 cents lower with September at $2.55\ a bushel; oats were
1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with September at $1.16 a bushel; and
soybeans were 3{ cents to 7{ cents lower with September at $6.26 a
bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Buying interest was spurred by a sharp rise in prices on the New
York Stock Exchange and the price declines in the oil and metals
market, traders said.
   Live cattle were .48 cent to .88 cent higher with October at
76.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .48 cent to .83 cent higher
with August at 88.65 cents a pound; hogs were .37 cent to .58 cent
higher with October at 49 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were 1.30 cent to 2 cents higher with February at 53.75 a pound.
   Livestock futures settled lower and pork futures higher in

   Under the new ruling, wholesale prices for beef products are
determined by market forces, with some controls to prevent
excessive profits, the statement said.
   Importers and wholesalers may now go beyond the previous
profit-ceiling of 15 drachmas a kilogram, or 4.5 cents a pound.
   But the government will intervene when profits rise too high.
The ministry did not define excessive profits.

   Federal securities regulators launched an

selling more than $4 million in unregistered or risky securities.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that Michael C.
Beatty, of St. Petersburg, Fla., sold $4.2 million in promissory
notes and other unregistered securities to investors between 1984
and 1988, while falsely claiming they were safe investments in a
sound company.
   The SEC also alleged that Beatty did not disclose to investors
that Minnesota authorities had ordered him to stop selling the
securities in 1987.
   The action by the SEC follows a default judgment by a federal
court in Minneapolis against Beatty ordering him to pay back more
than $1 million to investors.
   On June 1, a federal judge in Minneapolis issued an injunction
against Beatty, co-owner of Investment and Tax Services Inc.,
barring him from further alleged securities law violations after he
failed to respond to SEC allegations.
   The judge also ordered Beatty to pay back $1.47 million to
investors, although Beatty has filed for bankruptcy protection.
   Tim Warren, an enforcement division branch chief at the SEC's
Chicago regional office, said the SEC was seeking a hearing before
an administrative judge to determine what sanctions, if any, should
be imposed against Beatty following the Minneapolis court ruling.
   Possible sanctions range from censure to a bar from the
securities industry.
   Attempts to reach Beatty for comment were unsuccessful. There
was no telephone listing for him in St. Petersburg under the
address supplied in court papers.

   Stock prices surged upward today as hopes
increased for an orderly resolution of the showdown in the Middle
East.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials shot up 77.48 points to
2,610.40 by 3 p.m. Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 7 to 1 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,463 up, 226 down
and 279 unchanged.
   Stocks began to recover on Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial
average climbed 49.50 points from its lowest level of the year.
   Analysts said they gathered fresh momentum over the weekend when
fears of war in the Persian Gulf went unrealized.
   At the same time, many of the Street's chart-watchers argued
that stocks were ripe for a rebound after their steep drop since
mid-July.
   The market got some help from oil prices, which pulled back from
last week's highs, and the bond market, where interest rates fell.
   Brokers said investors also were heartened by conjecture that
the Federal Reserve had become increasingly willing to relax its
credit policy as recession worries intensified of late.
   Point-plus gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris,
up 1\ at 44{; Coca-Cola, up 2&rsqb; at 41&rsqb;; General Electric, up 2\ at
63|; Internationaal Business Machines, up 3&rsqb; at 103}, and Ford
Motor, up 1&lsqb; at 35{.
   Over-the-counter issues, even more depressed than the prominent
NYSE issues in this summer's selloff, also racked up sharp gains.
Microsoft climbed 4 to 60; MCI Communications 1&rsqb; to 34&lsqb;, and Apple
Computer 2\ to 38.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
jumped 5.10 to 176.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 4.11 at 320.40.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 139.88 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Lessening tension in the Middle East punched
down oil prices by more than $4 per barrel today in a selloff that
professional traders called the biggest one-day decline in recent
memory.
   Prices of wholesale unleaded gasoline and other refined
petroleum products also plummeted in response to a sense that the
threat of war has receded in the world's most abundant oil region.
   ``It's an easing of the tensions,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a
senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inronze at the
Tchaikovsky competition.
   At the Glinka competition and again at a contest in Italy in
1982, no first prize was given but he won the second prize. In
1984, he won first place and a special prize at a competition in
Helsinki, Finland.
   He said he heard ``War and Peace'' performed twice as a student.
   ``The part of Bolkonsky is very important to me and very close
to me, and before I never felt that way about a part,'' he said.
``Don Giovanni? I can sing it. I can sing it very convincingly, but
I feel much more with Bolkonsky.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as heavy losses in other
markets heavily influenced trading in the Chicago pits.
   ``The market looked at the outside markets and saw gold and
silver down sharply'' and followed suit, said Mickey Luth, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
``Fundamentally, there was no reason for the soybeans to be down,
but last week's rally made the market vulnerable to a selloff.''
   The weather also exerted pressure on soybean prices, as hot and
dry conditions prevailed in the Midwest and raised expectations for
higher yields.
   Soybean prices got some support from dryness in the Mississippi
delta, with the crop expected to be hurt if conditions do not
improve.
   Corn prices also were hurt by the weather, as Friday's 6- to
10-day forecast from the National Weather Service called for a
warming trend in the Midwest.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.81{ cents a bushel; corn
was 3\ cents to 6{ cents lower with September at $2.52 a bushel;
oats were 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with September at $1.13{ cents

<HEAD>Convict Four in Finance Scandal That Rocked Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Monday convicted four prominent
professionals including the ex-head of Guinness PLC for misconduct
over the brewing giant's multibillion-dollar takeover of a Scottish
distiller four years ago.
   The convictions capped a stunning chapter in what became known
as the biggest white-collar fraud in British history, the seamy
side of the country's explosive financial-market growth last decade.
   It tainted some of the most respected names in British business
and was described by investigators as a web of greed and deceit
that in many respects mirrored Wall Street's insider trading
scandal of the late 1980s.
   After nearly a week of deliberations, the jury at Southwark
Crown Court returned guilty verdicts on 19 of 20 counts against
former Guinness chairman and chief executive officer Ernest
Saunders; Gerald Ronson, chairman of Heron International PLC;
former stockbroker Anthony Parnes; and millionaire financier Sir
Jack Lyons.
   Four other men still face trial for their alleged involvement in
the scheme to illegally arrange for the purchase of Guinness stock
during the takeover fight for Distillers Co., a Scotch whisky and
gin maker, in 1986.
   Saunders, 54, was convicted of two charges of conspiracy to
contravene the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, eight charges
of false accounting and two charges of theft. He was acquitted of
illegally destroying documents.
   Ronson, 50, was found guilty of conspiracy to contravene the
Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, two charges of false
accounting and one of theft.
   Parnes, 44, was found guilty of four charges of false accounting
and two of theft.
   The jury convicted Lyons, 74, on two charges of conspiracy,
three charges of false accounting and one of theft.
   Saunders, who has maintained he is a scapegoat, smiled wryly as
the jury foreman read the verdicts. Afterwards, as he was led away,
he waved to son James and daughter Joanna in the court's public
gallery.
   ``We will never accept that our father has been dishonest,'' his
son said afterward. ``We will continue the fight to help him clear
his name.''
   Judge Denis Henry said sentencing would take place Tuesday for
Saunders, Ronson and Parnes, and on Sept. 25 for Lyons, who is to
undergo surgery this week.
   The four were accused of orchestrating an illegal operation to
support Guinness' stock price through undisclosed purchases of
Guinness shares, and thus make the brewer's $5.18 billion offer of
cash and stock more attractive than a rival bid from supermarket
operator Argyll Group PLC.
   Guinness succeeded in April 1986 in what was then Britain's
largest takeover. In December of that year, the Department of Trade
and Industry announced it was investigating and Saunders was
arrested in May 1987. Other arrests followed.
   The judge ruled that because of the complexity of the case it
should be split into two trials.
   In the second trial, expected to start in October, Saunders will
be joined by Roger Seelig, 44, former Morgan Grenfell and Co. Ltd.
corporate finance director; Lord Patrick Spens, 47, former director
of corporate finance at the merchant bank Henry Ansbacher and
corporate finance partner of the investment firm Cazenove and Co.
Ltd.; and David Mayhew, 48, who continues as senior corporate
finance partner of the investment firm Cazenove and Co.
   The seven men have pleaded innocent to all the charges and until
now each has been freed on about $850,000 bail.
   The eighth man is U.S. lawyer Thomas Ward, whom British police
are seeking to have extradited from the United States. Ward has
denied wrongdoing.
   The case was brought to trial by Britain's Serious Fraud Office,
set up two years ago to investigate and prosecute complex fraud
cases.
   Former Guinness director Jonathan Guinness said Monday that
while he felt sorry for Saunders and his family, ``I don't see how
the jury could have come to any other verdict.''

   Stock and bond prices jumped sharply today and
the price of oil plummeted as Mideast tensions appeared to ease and
OPEC ministers gathered to discuss boosting crude oil production.
   The value of the dollar dropped in foreign exchange as it
appeared the worst of the Iraqi crisis may have passed. The
dollar's value typically is supported in times of international
turmoil by investors who buy the currency as a safe haven.
   Iraq had demanded that the U.S. ambassador in Kuwait leave the
embassy in that nation, and Iraqi troops surrounded the embassy
over the weekend. But Iraq did not press its demand by using the
troops, helping ease market jitters about the eruption of armed
conflict, traders said.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
was up 77.48 points to 2,610.40 by 3 p.m. EDT.
   In the broader stock market, gaining issues outnumbered losers
by nearly 7 to 1 among New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
1,463 up, 226 down and 279 unchanged.
   Earlier, prices climbed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange amid
optimism about the Middle East situation. The Nikkei Stock Average
of 225 selected issues rose 976.00 points, or 4.04 percent, to
close at 25,141.76.
   The stock exchange in London was closed for a national holiday.
   Oil prices plummeted. In mid-afternoon trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest market for petroleum, the
October-delivery price of light sweet crude dropped $4.66 to $26.25
per barrel.
   In Vienna, representatives of 11 of the 13 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gathered at an
informal session. Ten of the nations have agreed in principle to
authorize an oil production increase, said a delegation source, who
demanded anonymity.
   About 4 million barrels of oil a day have been lost to the world
market because of the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti
oil. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded and occupied
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Treasury bond prices moved sharply higher. The benchmark 30-year
bond rose 1 7-16 points, or $14.38 per $1,000 face value. Its
yield, which falls when the price rises, fell to 9.00 percent from
9.15 percent Friday.
   The yield of the so-called long bond is an important rate used
to set the interest on some mortgages and other loans.
   Bond traders said their market was more optimistic that a
negotiated settlement could be reached in the Mideast through the
efforts of the United Nations. The financial markets have feared
that the outbreak of a war would further disrupt oil supplies,
sending inflation higher.
   Inflation is the greatest fear of the bond market, since it
erodes the value of the fixed-return securities. Inflation also
worries stock traders, since it puts a squeeze on corporate profits
and can lead to higher interest rates.

   Groups of independent gas station operators blocked
petroleum depots Monday in the Lyon and Montpellier regions of
France to protest a cut in their profit margins due to the Gulf
crisis.
   Riot police dislodged about 30 operators blocking access at the
Edouard-Harriot depot in Lyon. The action was aimed at stopping
tanker trucks from entering to load up with gasoline.
   About 20 independent operators blocked two depots in the Herault
region in southern France. The action lasted all day at the depot
in Frontignac, officials said.
   Independent operators are calling on the government to guarantee
them a minimum profit margin and to abolish gas price controls
which have reduced their profit margins.

   The president of Gannett News Services, Nancy
Woodhull, has been named executive vice president and editor in
chief at Time Warner Inc.'s Southern Progress Corp., it was
announced Monday.
   In the new job, Ms. Woodhull will be responsible for overseeing
the editorial direction of the magazines Southern Living,
Progressive Farmer, Southern Accents, Travel South and Cooking
Light.
   The post is newly created, the Birmingham, Ala.-based regional
book and magazine publisher said in a news release.
   Don Logan, president and chief executive, said the company has
expanded to five magazines from two over the past few years and
needed an experienced editorial manager to oversee the publications.
   Ms. Woodhull, 45, has been a professional journalist for about
26 years, and was a founding editor and the first managing
editor-news at Gannett Co. Inc.'s national newspaper USA Today. In
1984, she was named vice president of Gannett New Media, which has
explored new products and technology with an emphasis in spinoffs
from USA Today.
   In 1988, she became president of Gannett News Services, which
operates a national wire, radio and TV service available
exclusively to Gannett's 83 newspapers, 10 television stations and
16 radio stations.
   In a telephone interview, she said she had submitted her
resignation on Friday, effective Oct. 1.
   Asked why she was leaving Gannett, she said, ``It's more a case
of going to something. I was very impressed with the magazines
Southern Progress puts out,'' she said.
   Ms. Woodhull joined Gannett in 1975 as a night city editor for
the Times-Union in Rochester, N.Y. She had been a reporter for the
Detroit Free Press.
   She served as managing editor at the Times-Union and at another
Rochester paper, the Democrat and Chronicle, before moving to USA
Today in 1982.
   She is a native of Matawan, N.J., and has made her home for nine
years in McLean, Va., with her husband, William D. Watson. They
have a daughter.
   Time Warner is a New York-based entertainment and media
conglomerate which owns Southern Progress through its Time
Publishing Ventures Inc. unit.

   Stock prices rolled up their sharpest gain of
the year Monday as fears of war in the Persian Gulf abated and oil
prices took a steep drop.
   But the pace of trading slowed, and many analysts said they
weren't yet convinced that the market had pulled out of its long
summer swoon for good.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 78.71 to
2,611.63, for its biggest daily point gain since it climbed 88.12
points last Oct. 16 in the aftermath of a ``mini-crash'' on Wall
Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 6 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,453 up, 256 down and 287 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 160.15 million
shares, down from 199.04 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 197.94 million shares.
   Stocks began to recover from their 1990 lows on Friday, when the
Dow Jones industrial average gained 49.50 points.
   Analysts said the market gathered fresh momentum over the
weekend as the most intense fears of war in the Persian Gulf went
unrealized.
   At the same time, many of the Street's chart-watchers argued
that stocks were ripe for a rebound after their severe slide since
mid-July.
   The rally also drew a lot of inspiration from the oil market.
Crude oil futures plunged $4 a barrel to $26.91, registering the
most dramatic one-daay drop traders could recall at the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Brokers said investors also were heartened by conjecture that
the Federal Reserve had become increasingly willing to relax its
credit policy as recession worries intensified of late. Interest
rates fell in the bond market.
   Point-plus gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris,
up 1{ at 44}; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 4 at 75~; General Electric, up
2&lsqb; at 63{; International Business Machines, up 4 at 104&rsqb;, and Ford
Motor, up 1&lsqb; at 35{.
   Over-the-counter issues, even more depressed than the prominent
NYSE issues in this summer's selloff, also racked up sharp gains.
Microsoft climbed 4| to 60|; MCI Communications 1\ to 34, and Sun
Microsystems 1\ to 28~.
   Energy stocks were steady to moderately higher. But
precious-metals issues plunged as the price of gold plummeted. ASA
Ltd. fell 4&rsqb; to 48&lsqb;; Homestake Mining 2&lsqb; to 19}, and Newmont Gold
4&rsqb; to 47.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $92.46 billion, or
3.14 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 5.13 to 176.18.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 11.95 to 380.70, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 9.93 at 321.44.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
picked up 13.94 to 381.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the

   The dollar dropped to a post-war low against the
German mark Monday while gold prices tumbled more than $25 an ounce
amid selling sparked by a perception that tensions have eased in
the Middle East.
   A slide in oil prices relieved some anxiety about the
inflationary consequences of a prolonged Persian Gulf conflict and
encouraged sales of gold and the dollar. Gold bullion often is
bought as a hedge against inflation.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
settled at $388.30 a troy ounce, down $26.70 from Friday's close.
Later, Republic National Bank quoted an ounce of gold at $389, $25
lower than the late bid Friday.
   Currency trading was lighter than normal because markets in
London were closed for a bank holiday.
   In European activity, the dollar hit a post-World War II closing
low of 1.5423 German marks in Frankfurt, West Germany, down from
1.5575 marks late Friday. The previous lowest closing level for the
dollar against the mark was 1.5445 marks, set last Thursday in New
York.
   The dollar traded as low as 1.5385 German marks during the day
in Frankfurt before recovering. Its previous intraday low was
1.5400 marks on Thursday.
   When activity shifted later to North America, the dollar lost
ground in New York. It fell to 1.5505 marks from 1.5605 marks late
Friday.
   Currency analysts said rising optimism about chances for a
negotiated settlement to the conflict caused by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait reduced demand for dollars. Investors typically
buy dollars as a safe haven for their holdings during times of
international turmoil.
   Worries about the flagging U.S. economy, temporarily put aside
during a dollar buying binge that followed the Iraqi invasion, were
given a higher priority in trading decisions.
   Speculation that U.S. interest rates eventually will be nudged
lower to foster an economic revival has weighed on the dollar. If
rates fall in the U.S. while rising or remaining unchanged
overseas, returns on dollar-denominated securities would be less
appealing.
   Michael Faust of MMS International in New York said the Japanese
yen took center stage in North American currency trading.
   Buying interest in the yen coincided with the decline in world
oil prices, a welcome development for oil import-dependent Japan. A
rebound in the Japanese stock market also helped restore faith in
the yen.
   Oil prices were bid down on the assumption that many OPEC
countries may boost output temporarily to compensate for the gap
left by the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti petroleum.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met informally in
Vienna, Austria, to discuss a response to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   A barrel of light sweet crude, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude
oil, plunged $4 to settle at $26.91 on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   By the time trading was done in New York, the dollar was quoted
at 144.20 yen, down from 146.75 late Friday.Earlier, in Tokyo, the
dollar fell to a closing 144.80 Japanese yen from 145.70 at
Friday's close.
   In Europe, the British pound rose to $1.9505 from $1.9445 Friday
in London. Sterling gained in New York and a pound fetched $1.94335
compared to $1.9400 on Friday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
late quotes included: 1.2735 Swiss francs, up from 1.2720; 5.2010
French francs, down from 5.2360; 1,149.50 Italian lire, down from
1,159.50; and 1.14315 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1353.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, were: 1.2670 Swiss francs, down from 1.2685; 5.1745 French
francs, down from 5.2275; 1.7365 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7550;
1,142.75 Italian lire, down from 1,157.50; and 1.1335 Canadian
dollars, unchanged.
   Gold prices fell nearly $9 an ounce in light trading in
Switzerland. Precious metals markets in London and Hong Kong were
closed for national holidays.
   In Zurich, gold fell to $401 a troy ounce from $410.75 late
Friday.
   Silver followed gold's lead. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.848 a troy ounce, down from
$5.187 on Friday.

<HEAD>Prices Fall as Middle East Tension Lessens</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Most commodity futures prices on the New York and Chicago
exchanges were battered Monday as concerns about the possibility of
war decreased, with oil off sharply on reports OPEC oil ministers
may soon decide to raise crude output.
   Precious metals futures fell; grain and soybeans were down; and
livestock and pork futures gained.
   The lack of military action in the Persian Gulf provided the
bearish tone for energy futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange
on the improved prospects for a diplomatic solution to the crisis
triggered by Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   The perceptions that the crisis may be resolved peacefully were
prompted by the Security Council's weekend sanction of force
against Iraq. Other diplomatic activity suggested the Iraqis were
feeling acute isolation over their seizure of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and
were willing to talk. An OPEC meeting in Vienna also led traders to
bid down the price of oil.
   Robert Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
in New York, said it is likely the market will continue its
downward trend Tuesday.
   Despite the sharp drop in oil prices, analysts said crude can
move back up as easily as it moves down, depending on whatever news
comes from the Middle East.
   Light sweet crude settled $2 to $4.01 lower with the contract
for delivery in October at $26.91 a barrel; heating oil was 6 cents
to 12.86 cents lower with September at 78.10 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 6 cents to 17.10 cents lower with September
at 87.56 cents a gallon.
   Precious metals futures declined sharply on New York's Commodity
Exchange, with an analyst saying the decline shows the precious
metals market is fundamentally weak.
   ``The movement upward was based on sharply higher oil prices and
political factors,'' said Peter Cardillo, an analyst with Jesup,
Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York. ``The market gave back a good portion
of the gains of the past three weeks.''
   Cardillo noted that the precious metals market was weak across
the board, with selling by banks, speculators and funds. He said it
is likely the market will see more selling on Tuesday, before
gaining some support.
   Gold was $26.70 to $28.90 lower with August at $388.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 34.2 cents to 39 cents lower with August at
$4.848 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   ``The market looked at the outside markets and saw gold and
silver down sharply'' and followed suit, said Mickey Luth, an
analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago.
``Fundamentally, there was no reason for the soybeans to be down,
but last week's rally made the market vulnerable to a selloff.''
   The weather also exerted pressure on soybean prices, as hot and
dry conditions prevailed in the Midwest and raised expectations for
higher yields.
   Soybean prices got some support from dryness in the Mississippi
delta, with the crop expected to be hurt if conditions do not
improve.
   Corn prices also were hurt by the weather, as Friday's 6- to
10-day forecast from the National Weather Service called for a
warming trend in the Midwest.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 3{ cents lower with September at $2.81{
cents a bushel; corn was 3\ cents to 6} cents lower with September
at $2.52 a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 4{ cents lower with
September at $1.13{ cents a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents to 11
cents lower with September at $6.19 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Buying interest in livestock was spurred by a sharp rise in
prices on the New York Stock Exchange and the declines in the oil
and metals market, traders said.
   Pork futures were boosted by Friday's U.S. Agriculture
Department cold storage report which showed a greated-than-expected
drawdown of frozen bellies in July.
   Live cattle were .60 cent to 1.23 cents higher with October at
76.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .53 cent to 1.45 cents
higher with August at 88.70 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to
.78 cent higher with October at 49.20 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 2 cents higher with February at 54.37 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Appeals Court To Reconsider Chestman Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court agreed Monday to reconsider a
decision overturning the conviction of a stockbroker charged with
trading on inside information about the 1986 takeover of the
Waldbaum supermarket chain.
   Federal prosecutors had asked for the rehearing, saying that the
May 2 decision by a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals threatened future insider trading prosecutions.
   A full panel of the appeals court Nov. 9 will rehear the appeal
of the stockbroker, Robert Chestman of Gruntal &amp; Co.
   In the May decision, judges ruled 2-1 to vacate Chestman's March
1989 conviction on securities fraud, mail fraud and perjury charges.
   The conviction stemmed from trades he made after receiving
information about A&amp;P's takeover of Waldbaum Inc. from a client who
was a Waldbaum family member.
   The court found there was no proof Chestman knew the information
was confidential when he received it from Keith Loeb, a nephew by
marriage to company founder Ira Waldbaum.
   The judges also ruled there was no evidence that Loeb, who
cooperated with authorities, violated a breach of fiduciary duty in
giving the information to Chestman.
   In court papers, prosecutors said the decision was incorrect and
would ``seriously impair the government's ability to bring future
insider trading cases against tippees.''
   ``Moreover, the decision may well be viewed by the securities
industry as providing a safe harbor within which to trade on inside
information,'' the government said.
   Chestman's attorney, Elkan Abramowitz, said he was not surprised
the appeals court granted a rehearing but said he did not
immediately want to respond to the government's arguments.

<TEXT>
   Oil prices fell by $4 a barrel Monday, the
sharpest one-day decline traders could remember, in a selloff that
reflected easing fear of a war in the Middle East.
   The notion that there might not be any shooting in the nearly
month-old conflict also punched down wholesale prices of unleaded
gasoline and home heating oil.
   ``The surprise in the market place may have been an improved
outlook for a peaceful solution in the Middle East,'' said Bob
Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Traders were responding partly to news that U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar would meet Thursday in
Jordan with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz to discuss the crisis
that began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   A lack of hostilities over the weekend and the likelihood of
increased oil production by OPEC nations also helped push oil
prices down, analysts said.
   In Vienna, sources said ministers from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries appeared near agreement on an
informal deal that would allow some countries to temporarily
increase production in response to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Light sweet crude, the benchmark U.S. blend, fell $4 to $26.91
per barrel for October delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, a key market for petroleum. That snapped a streak of
three days in which oil traded above $30 per barrel for the first
time in nearly five years.
   The Merc doesn't keep records of petroleum price ranges, but
exchange officials and traders said they couldn't recall a bigger
one-day drop.
   Crude oil fell $3.04 per barrel on the Merc on April 24, 1989,
following a sharp rise that occurred amid jitters caused by the
Exxon Valdez accident and a gas leak and explosion on a major oil
platform in the North Sea, said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil
analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   There were a also couple of one-day drops exceeding $2 in
December 1985 and January 1986, after OPEC nations announced
pricing changes that sent oil into a long decline, Hittle said.
Despite the recent wild swings in crude prices, she said, traders
were caught off guard by the sharpness of Monday's decline.
   ``People were expecting a correction,'' Hittle said. ``I don't
think anyone thought it would be quite so steep.''
   Unleaded gasoline also fell farther in one day than anyone at
the exchange could remember, dropping 17.10 cents to 87.56 cents
per gallon for September delivery. Gasoline had risen above the $1
mark for the first time last week as it went through seven straight
days of record high closes, but at one point Monday it was down
more than 20 cents per gallon.
   Crude oil, at its lowest on Monday, traded $4.86 per barrel less
than Friday's closing price of $30.91.
   Home heating oil plummeted 12.86 cents to 78.10 cents per gallon
for September delivery. Natural gas dipped from $1.525 to $1.502
per 1,000 cubic feet on October contracts.
   Hittle said Monday's downturn was accentuated by a British
banking holiday, which prompted traders in London to make oil deals
elsewhere.
   ``We're getting European selling,'' Hittle said. That can force
U.S. prices farther down if they are falling or farther up if they
happen to be rising, she said.
   Those who follow oil prices said there is no reliable way to
predict where they will go, because of the uncertainties in the
Persian Gulf. Some said prices could easily shoot back up.
   ``We're not by any means to the point where we're going to call
a full turn here,'' Baker said. ``Tune in every morning to see what
the newspapers say and what the radio bulletins are giving us. We
start from there.''

<HEAD>Fall 78 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Cinema Corp. said Monday that its
third-quarter profits plunged 78 percent, in part because of a drop
in summer moviegoers.
   For the three months ended July 31, General Cinema reported
earnings of $5.7 million, or 8 cents per share, against earnings of
$25.6 million, or 35 cents per share, in the same 1989 period.
   Revenue rose 3.1 percent to $506 million from $491.3 million a
year earlier.
   Earnings from the firm's theaters division plunged to $1.3
million from $12.2 million a year ago. For the first nine months of
1990, General Cinema Theaters had an operating loss of $1.7
million, compared to operating profits of $9.7 million in the same
year-ago period.
   ``Summer pictures this year did not attract the number of
patrons which the industry had been anticipating, resulting in
attendance levels well below the record levels of the summer of
1989,'' General Cinema Chairman Richard A. Smith said in a
statement.
   ``The lower patronage, combined with continuing higher film and
occupancy costs, resulted in the disappointing earnings
performance,'' he said.
   Smith said sluggish theater revenues were likely to continue
through the fiscal year. During the quarter, General Cinema
Theaters opened 52 screens and closed 10 others, bringing to 1,488
the number of screens at 314 theaters.
   General Cinema's income from interest and dividends dropped to
$22.3 million from $41.4 million a year ago, reflecting payment of
nearly $600 million of capital gains taxes in January related to
the firm's sale of its soft-drink bottling business.
   The sale reduced the amount of General Cinema's investable funds
to $1.1 billion from $1.7 billion a year ago.
   General Cinema's consolidated statements include operating
results of Neiman Marcus Group, the company's 60-percent owned
retailing subsidiary, with a lag of one quarter.
   Smith said that after deducting minority interest, Neiman Marcus
contributed $2.8 million in earnings for the quarter, compared to
$3.9 million a year ago.
   The Neiman Marcus current year results are for the period
through its third quarter ended May 5.
   General Cinema profits for the first nine months of the year
were $55.6 million, or 75 cents per share, down 43 percent from $98
million, or $1.33 per share, in the same period last year.
   The 1989 figures included an after-tax gain of $52 million, or
70 cents per share, from the sale of securities.

   Exxon U.S.A. will spend $2.8 million to
improve environmental safeguards at a refinery to settle a lawsuit
for fouling a New Jersey waterway, officials said Monday.
   The settlement resolves allegations that Exxon violated the
terms of its state wastewater discharge permit at its refinery in
Bayonne, which discharges into the Kill Van Kull waterway.
   The New Jersey Public Interest Research Group and Friends of the
Earth filed the lawsuit in May 1989 in federal district court in
Newark under the federal Clean Water Act, which provides for such
citizen action.
   Exxon, without any finding or admission of liability, agreed to
invest $2.8 million for ``environmentally beneficial mitigation
projects'' at the Bayonne facility, NJPIRG said.
   The measures are supplementary to the existing wastewater
treatment system at the facility. Exxon also must comply with
effluent limitations and other requirements of its wastewater
discharge permit, issued by the state Department of Environmental
Protection.
   Exxon will spend $1.8 million to install geodesic dome roofs on
15 petroleum storage tanks to prevent rainwater from entering the
tanks.
   Contaminated rainwater now must be drained to the facility's
wastewater collection system for processing in the wastewater
treatment plant and then discharged into the Kill Van Kull. Domes
will reduce the wastewater at its source, NJPIRG said.
   Exxon will spend an additional $995,000 on a petroleum product
collection system at its barge pier. The closed above-ground
collection system will reduce the potential for pollution at its
source, NJPIRG said.
   Exxon spokesman Amos Plante said the agreement ``demonstrates
Exxon's commitment not only to comply fully with all permit
requirements but also to take further responsible steps designed to
reduce or eliminate waste materials at their source.''

<HEAD>Hits Lowest Point Since 1983</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer confidence in the U.S. economy dropped
this month to the lowest level since 1983 and raised the biggest
threat of recession in many years, the Conference Board
organization said Monday.
   The New York-based business research group said its Consumer
Confidence Index, a widely watched barometer of perceptions about
the economy, fell 18 points from the July level to 83.8, partly
because of fears about the Middle East.
   That was the lowest level since 83.1 in April 1983, when the
economy was emerging from a recession.
   Consumer confidence is considered a crucial element of economic
forecasting because it indicates American willingness to borrow and
spend. Consumerism accounts for a major portion of all U.S.
economic activity.
   The findings substantiated the view of other economists who say
consumers were increasingly worried even before the Middle East
crisis caused by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But the survey showed the invasion heightened those fears
because of the rising price of oil, resurrecting memories of the
1970s oil shocks.
   ``Given the economic uncertainties generated by the Middle East
crisis, a loss in the consumer's sense of security is inevitable,''
said Fabian Linden, executive director of the group's Consumer
Research Center.
   ``Even before the Kuwait invasion, there were indications that
the economy might be in trouble,'' he said. ``But if the present
political crisis is not resolved quickly, and people become more
hesitant to spend, the economy could soon move into recession.
Recession is more likely now than it has been in many years.''
   The most notable elements of the Conference Board survey showed
showed 20 percent of respondents felt conditions are good, down
from 23 percent in July. The number who feel conditions are bad
rose to 24 percent from 21 percent.
   Only 21 percent feel the number of jobs are plentiful, down from
nearly 26 percent in July and nearly 32 percent a year ago. By
contrast, the number of respondents who feel jobs are difficult to
find rose to nearly 26 percent, vs. 22 percent in July.
   Nearly 19 percent of survey respondents feel conditions will
worsen in the next six months, up from 12 percent in July. Less
than 14 percent believe the situation will improve, vs. 17 percent
in July.
   The survey, covering 5,000 households nationwide, calculates an
index of consumer confidence based on questions about business
conditions, employment, income, vacation plans and major purchases
over the next six months.

   Boeing Co. said Monday that crews have been sent
to Britain to replace engine-mount pylons on all seven of British
Airways' 767s after cracks were found on six of the jets.
   The British carrier grounded the 767s, powered by Rolls-Royce
engines, after finding a crack in a pylon on one of the twin-jets
during routine maintenance, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group
spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said.
   ``We inspected the others and five more had similar cracks so we
grounded the fleet,'' said John Lampl, British Airways spokesman in
New York.
   British Airways is the only operator of 767s with Rolls-Royce
engines. Other 767s have either General Electric or Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines and are not affected, Reese said.
   British Airways took delivery of the first of its 767
wide-bodies in February.
   Boeing redesigned the engine mounts to fix the problem and is
paying the repair costs, Reese said. She said she had no idea what
the cost would be. The engine mount pylon holds the engine to the
wing.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has approved the redesigned
part and Boeing was awaiting approval from Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority, Reese said.

<HEAD>Contractor Pleads Guilty in Scheme to Defraud Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A maker of Army field radios agreed Monday to
plead guilty and pay $4.65 million to settle federal criminal and
civil charges in a scheme to defraud the government by falsifying
test results.
   E-Systems Inc. of Dallas pleaded guilty to a three-count
criminal information in U.S. District Court charging that it
conspired to falsify records and test results of tactical field
radios supplied to the Army.
   Prosecutors charged the company repeatedly altered performance
records and concealed repairs and defects in test radios to ensure
the Army would accept and pay for them.
   The investigation began in 1985 after the Army ended two
E-Systems contracts to build radios through its Memcor Division in
Bushnell, Fla. The company had been building the Army's principal
vehicle-carried field radios since 1969.
   E-Systems appealed the termination and the testing program
irregularities were noticed at that time. The company later sued
the government over the termination.
   In its plea, E-Systems agreed to pay a $2 million criminal fine
and $1.8 million in restitution. The plea agreement also calls for
the company to drop its pending $38 million lawsuit against the
government.
   Also, the company will pay $850,000 to cover false claims
submitted as part of its civil lawsuit.
   Earlier this month, three former managers and a former
supervisor at E-Systems' Memcor Division were indicted on charges
of repeatedly falsifying records and test results to conceal
failures and defects in the radios.
   In January, a front-line supervisor of production, Sadonna S.
Hobbs, was convicted of perjury relating to her denials of the
activity. She is serving a 16-month prison sentence.

<HEAD>Judge Overturns $148 Million Award to Liggett Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday overturned a $148.8
million jury award to cigarette maker Liggett Group against Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., which had been found guilty of predatory
pricing.
   U.S. District Judge Frank W. Bullock in Greensboro, N.C., said
the jury had come to its decision in March using legally
insufficient evidence. He denied a motion for a retrial by Liggett,
which had accused its larger rival of trying to put it out of
business.
   Brown &amp; Williamson is the nation's third largest cigarette maker
with brands including Kool and Viceroy. Liggett, the nation's
smallest cigarette maker, has the L&amp;M, Lark and Chesterfield brands.
   Bullock said Liggett had failed to show that Brown &amp; Williamson
had injured Liggett in a dispute that centered on generic
cigarettes, which cost about one third less than the average pack
price of $1.60.
   Alan Hilburg, a Liggett spokesman, said company lawyers were
studying Bullock's decision and had not decided whether to appeal.
   In its lawsuit, Liggett argued that Brown &amp; Williamson in 1984
and 1985 used volume discounts and rebates to wholesalers, which
forced Liggett to match the incentives and reduced its profits.
Liggett's market share was the industry's lowest before it entered
the discount business.
   Liggett, based in Durham, N.C., also charged that Louisville,
Ky.-based Brown &amp; Williamson had copied Liggett's plain
black-and-white packaging in an attempt to confuse consumers.
   After 115 days of testimony and nine days of deliberations, a
federal jury in Greensboro awarded Liggett $49.6 million in
damages, which automatically is tripled under the law.
   ``The judge's ruling underscores that what happened when Brown &amp;
Williamson began selling generic cigarettes is exactly what's
supposed to happen in a free-enterprise system,'' Brown &amp;
Williamson said in a statement.
   Industry figures show that Liggett Group had a 14.4 percent
market share in discount cigarettes in 1989, down from 15.2 percent
the previous year. Brown &amp; Williamson's generic share was 23.3
percent in 1989, up from 20.4 percent.

   Oil prices plunged $4 per barrel and stocks
rallied to their best gains of the year Monday, as the financial
markets sensed a reduced threat of war in the Mideast and a
possible OPEC agreement to boost oil production.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
climbed 78.71 points to close at 2,611.63. It was the Dow's biggest
one-day jump since last Oct. 16, when it climbed 88.12 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by nearly 6 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.
   In earling trading Tuesday, prices continued to climb on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the dollar tumbled against the Japanese
yen, also amid optimism about the Gulf situation.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 518.52
points, or 2.06 percent, to close the morning session at 25,660.28,
on top of a 4.04 percent rise Monday.
   The stock exchange in London was closed for a national holiday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest market
for petroleum, the October-delivery price of light, sweet crude
dropped $4 to close at $26.91 per barrel. Traders called it the
steepest one-day decline in memory for the benchmark grade of oil.
   ``That's an enormous decline, and these markets are very, very
sensitive to oil prices at this time,'' said John D. Paulus, chief
economist at the investment firm Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co.
   Unleaded gasoline for September delivery fell 17.1 cents a
gallon to close at 87.56 cents on the exchange.
   Among the signs of reduced tensions in the Persian Gulf, traders
said the markets were encouraged that Iraq did not use military
measures to enforce its demand that the U.S. ambassador in Kuwait
leave the embassy. Iraqi troops had surrounded the embassy over the
weekend, but an Iraqi deadline passed with no action taken.
   In addition, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
planned to meet Thursday with Iraq's foreign minister to try to
mediate an end to the crisis.
   In Vienna, representatives of 11 of the 13 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries gathered at an
informal session. Ten of the nations have agreed in principle to
allow individual OPEC nations to exceed their oil production
quotas, said a delegation source, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   About 4 million barrels of oil a day have been lost to the world
market because of the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti.
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Oil traders said the drop in prices also was accelerated by the
market's tendency to make drastic ``corrections'' after prices move
too far in one direction. Oil leaped above $30 per barrel last week
for the first time in nearly five years.
   The bond market took encouragement from the oil drop as well,
because of its implications for inflation and interest rates. The
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 19-32 points, or $15.94 per
$1,000 face value. Its yield, which falls when the price rises,
dropped to 8.99 percent from 9.15 percent Friday.
   Higher oil prices had threatened to ignite inflation, which
erodes the value of fixed-rate securities.
   The dollar did not join stocks and bonds in the upswing. In New
York trading, it fell to 1.5505 German marks from 1.5605 marks late
Friday _ a post-war low against the mark.
   Traders said currency investors remained concerned about the
state of the U.S. economy and its impact on the dollar. They said
investors have been more concerned about the faltering U.S. economy
and its impact on the dollar than on the Mideast upheaval.
   The dollar's value has been slipping for months, and although it
has proven to be a safe haven in times of political turmoil, the
currency has gained little from the threat of war in the Mideast.
