   The courting couple in Richard Greenberg's ``The
American Plan'' resembled wounded butterflies, and the audience was
left longing for their escape from the wicked widow who aims so
well with her butterfly net.
   ``The American Plan,'' directed by Evan Yionoulis, opened Sunday
at the Manhattan Theater Club, and was to run through Jan. 18.
   Wendy Makkena plays the fey, 20ish Lili Adler who says things
that indicate she's unbalanced. D.W. Moffett, in the role of Nick
Lockridge, is the visitor to a Catskills hotel across the lake who
woos her.
   Lili's widowed mother, played with a sophisticated turn by Joan
Copeland with a German accent, is determined to keep Lili to
herself, though why is never made clear.
   She tells Nick that Lili isn't just charmingly neurotic but has
been in a mental hospital.
   Greenberg, best known here for his play ``Eastern Standard,''
drops in undefined mysteries and undercurrents to give the audience
little chills.
   The audience quickly sided with Nick and Lili, hoping they can
get together even if he seems to be a fortunehunter.
   When the widow fails to warn Nick off, she tells him she'll send
him to college after the marriage. She repeats those words in front
of Lili, knowing it will send her into a mini-breakdown and help
her to isolate her daughter.
   So that the audience doesn't think it's attending a rewrite of
``The Heiress'' Greenberg has an old love of Nick's show up and
it's a man.
   The final scene is played in the Adler apartment in 1970, 10
years after the Catskills scenes.
   The plot suffers somewhat. Lili says things that don't tally
with what went before. Also, her personality is markedly changed -
brittle and down-to-earth sane. Makkena seemed uncomfortable with
the new persona and presented it rather weakly.
   How the story ends is less interesting than the personalities of
the three main characters and the hints of frightening unknowns in
their backgrounds and lives.

<TEXT>
   A telethon for emergency aid to
the Soviet Union collected $12.2 million, most of which will go
toward medicine after organizers concluded that a Soviet famine is
not imminent, Dutch Radio said.
   The four-hour nationwide telethon Saturday evening was organized
by former Agriculture Minister Gerrit Braks and included live
broadcasts from Moscow and news about the dwindling food supplies
in Kiev and Leningrad.
   Braks' ``Food Aid To The Russians'' foundation had been planning
to use the money to distribute food to residents of Moscow's Lenin
district.
   But the committee changed its strategy after Dutch media
reported that there seemed to be enough food to go round in many
Soviet cities.
   Several Western nations have sent food to the Soviet Union to
help people there get through the winter. Soviet officials say they
appear to have adequate food supplies; the problem is storing and
distributing the goods.

<TEXT>
   Seven Portuguese-speaking nations with a
total population of 185 million have agreed to adopt identical
spellings for their common language.
   Portugal, its former African colonies - Cape Verde, Angola,
Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome e Principe - and Brazil hope
the controversial accord they signed Sunday will create a unified
market for Portuguese-language books and movies.
   The accord simplifies and harmonizes spellings of a wide list of
vocabulary. It also adds three new letters to the alphabet and
removes some accents and letters that are no longer spoken.
   But critics say the accord could muddle the tongue.
   When it takes full effect by the beginning of 1994, some
Portuguese words with very different roots and meaning will be
spelled the same.

<TEXT>
   On a brisk fall weekend, thousands of people
streamed up a stone stairway to a 350-year-old tomb honoring the
man who, far more than microchips or management systems, created
modern Japan.
   The tomb of Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa and a gold-encrusted shrine
sit in a forest 70 miles northeast of Tokyo. The shogun was
promoted in death from man to god and is known as Gongen-sama,
``Protector of the Realm.''
   For many visitors, the journey may be just an opportunity to
view the autumn foliage, but another impulse sends even retired
people and young couples with toddlers up the 530-foot stairway.
   ``Wherever you go in Japan, there's evidence of the Tokugawa
era, so a lot of people are curious to see this place,'' said
Tsuchiyasu Kiyomitsu, a 30-year-old businessman who rested as other
visitors rang a long-corded bell and paid obeisance.
   The big-bellied shogun was a warlord of legendary willpower who
completed the unification of Japan in 1600 and virtually cut it off
from the world.
   Japan's isolation lasted 268 years, and the family dynasty he
founded deified Tokugawa after his death to help legitimize itself.
   During the long period of isolation, Japan created its own brand
of capitalism, including the world's first futures market (in
rice). It also refined the group behavior that still distinguishes
Japanese society, scholars say.
   Under the Tokugawas, Japan began evolving the paternalistic,
protected-market economy that has confounded policy makers in
Washington, inspired Japan-bashing around the world and helped make
the small archipelago very rich.
   Not surprisingly for Japan, where families routinely trace their
ancestry back for centuries, the Tokugawa legacy exists in the
flesh as well as in folklore.
   Had the dynasty not been overthrown in 1868, the man who might
be shogun today is Tsunenari Tokugawa, 50, current head of the
family. He manages North American operations for Nippon Yusen, a
Tokyo-based shipping company.
   ``Basically, everything that you call Japanese, our weaknesses
and our strong points, many of them in a sense matured in this
260-year period,'' he told an interviewer in his Tokyo office.
   ``Maybe we matured too strongly,'' he added with a smile,
referring to international criticism of Japan's economic practices.
   Tsunenari Tokugawa, a child of postwar egalitarian Japan, gave
an embarrassed laugh about his aristocratic lineage and pointed out
that he goes to work every day like any other ``salaryman.''
   The executive, whose wide eyes and broad face resemble portraits
of Ieyasu Tokugawa, acknowledged that he and other scions of old
feudal families often discuss the imprint his ancestors made.
   ``Whether we like it or not, we are still living under the long
line of Tokugawa influence,'' he said. ``That includes many, many,
many things: the way we think, the way we form teamwork, our system
of education.''
   Perhaps the most enduring legacy developed from a clever method
Ieyasu Tokugawa and his descendants used to stay in power, scholars
say. They kept the feudal domains they controlled off balance by
forcing each daimyo, or lord, to spend half the year in Tokyo.
   This created a nationwide capital network, since money had to
move in and out of Tokyo to support the pilgrimages.
   Fierce competition arose between domain governments and group
allegiance developed within them. The competition led each domain
to promote industry and agriculture, in part to pay for the
expensive journeys.
   ``The domain governments were strongly paternalistic,'' wrote
Marius Jansen, a Princeton University expert on Tokugawa Japan.
   ``They instituted monopolies in whatever was profitable for
export (to other domains). It is no accident that one of the great
modern firms, that of Mitsubishi, had its origins in such an
administrative arrangement.''
   Friends and colleagues tease Tsunenari Tokugawa about the
``shogun business'' he must attend to. On each anniversary of
Ieyasu's death, he goes to the Nikko shrine and dons the
traditional court costume.
   This year, the government called upon him to help celebrate the
400th anniversary of Tokyo, the city Ieyasu founded and made the
capital of Japan.
   Every March 1, Tokyo fishermen practice one of the more obscure
traditions binding Shogun Ieyasu Tokugawa to modern Japan. They
deliver a load of fresh whitebait to Tsunenari's home as
compensation for the fishing rights his ancestors granted theirs.
   ``These things are not really for the Tokugawa family,''
Tsunenari Tokugawa said. ``In a sense, it's in order for them to
prove their identity.''

<TEXT>
   The British Broadcasting Corp. has announced plans
for a new international operation that will lead to a television
version of its World Service radio broadcasting.
   The new service, BBC-TV International, probably will be launched
in the spring and could become a full world service by the end of
the century, the corporation's chief executive, Chris Irwin, said
Sunday.
   It will be linked to another new service, BBC World Service
Television News, which will provide TV news in different languages
and incorporate video from the U.S. network NBC and the Visnews
news agency, the BBC said.
   The new services will be based on an existing satellite service,
BBC-TV Europe, which uses the Intelstat satellite to beam programs
into nearly 7 million European homes, the BBC said.
   The widely respected World Service radio programming, financed
by the government, is broadcast around the world in many languages
and reaches a reported audience of 120 million.

<TEXT>
   A college chemistry student with a
previous bomb conviction was charged with building a 35-pound bomb
strong enough to destroy anything within 150 yards, authorities
said.
   University of North Florida student Christopher Jones, 25, was
arrested Thursday after a one-month sting operation, police said
Friday.
   An undercover officer told Jones ``he needed a bomb to blow up a
car and kill someone,'' said Sheriff Jim McMillan. ``That didn't
seem to bother him a whole lot.''
   ``This is what we call a megabomb. If this bomb had been
detonated, it could have caused substantial damage or death to
anyone or any property'' within a 150-yard radius, said Willi
Ellison, an agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms.
   The bomb, 18 inches tall, was built from a liquid propane tank
which had been cut in half, filled with chemical explosives and
equipped with a five-minute fuse, Ellison said.
   Jones was arrested Thursday after the undercover officer paid
$300 for the device, which was dismantled by bomb squad officers.
   He faces 10 years in prison and a $250 fine if convicted of
possessing an unregistered explosive.
   Jones was convicted of exploding two pipe bombs at a convenience
store in 1985 and was placed on five years probation. No one was
injured.

   A cattle rancher and his son were
convicted of first-degree murder Saturday for killing Chico Mendes,
the rain forest defender whose death focused global attention on
the destruction of the Amazon.
   The defendants were each sentenced to 19 years in prison at the
end of the four-day trial. The prosecutors, accusing the ranchers
of having ``stained the forest with his blood,'' had urged the
maximum 30-year sentence.
   The seven-member jury decided Darly Alves da Silva planned the
Dec. 22, 1988, slaying and that his son Darci Alves Pereira fired
the shotgun that killed Mendes.
   Scores of Mendes' supporters and relatives who jammed the tiny,
sweltering wooden courthouse burst into applause when Judge Adair
Longhini read the verdict after conferring with the jury for more
than three hours.
   Ilzamar Mendes, the slain rubber tapper's widow, burst into
tears.
   Osmarino Amancio Rodrigues, seen as Mendes' successor in the
rubber tappers union that campaigns against destruction of the
forest, joined hands with other tappers and flashed a ``V'' sign.
   Defense attorney Ruben Torres said his clients would appeal.
   ``You can't judge a man guilty on false testimony,'' said Dari
da Silva, Alves da Silva's brother.
   The trial in this Amazon river town 2,650 miles northwest of Rio
de Janeiro opened Wednesday with the surprise murder confession by
23-year-old Alves Pereira, who claimed he had acted alone. His
father fought the charges.
   The trial caused a sensation in this nation of 150 million,
where Mendes, 44, is seen as an ecological martyr who died
defending the vast Amazon jungle from slash-and-burn destruction by
ranchers and farmers.
   The Amazon is the world's largest rain forest and the only
habitat for many plant and animal species. Rubber tappers and
others depend on the forest for their livelihood, but once the
jungle is cleared it becomes barren of most vegetation within a few
years.
   A Texas-sized chunk of the forest already has been cut down.
   Prosecutor Marcio Thomaz Bastos, a former Brazilian Bar
Association president, said it was the first time in Brazil that
the planner of a slaying had been convicted of murder.
   ``Darci and Darly surely practiced many other crimes,'' said the
jubilant Bastos. ``This trial should serve as a lever so we can
open up other cases.''
   The 54-year-old Alves da Silva slumped in his chair and pressed
a white handkerchief to his face during closing arguments as Bastos
shouted: ``You killed him, you!''
   Bastos had said a verdict of guilty would end an ``atmosphere of
terror'' in the far western Amazon state of Acre, where rich
landowners often use hired gunmen to eliminate their opponents.
   In his three-hour closing statement, defense attorney Ruben
Lopes Torres said Alves Pereira was so perturbed by the mounting
legal pressure Mendes was applying against his father that he was
pushed into committing the murder.
   Mendes in 1988 led local rubber tappers and their families to
stand in front of bulldozers ready to clear virgin forest owned by
Alves da Silva.
   Earlier Saturday, about 150 people attended a dawn vigil at the
tomb of Mendes, who would have been 46 on Saturday.
   The group of relatives, rubber tappers and foreign visitors then
walked to Mendes' humble wooden house near the town square for a
memorial ceremony in memory of his birthday.
   ``It was two years ago that Chico told me he would be spending
his last birthday with me,'' said a weeping Ilzamar Mendes. ``He
still lives within the people that are carrying on his work.''
   On a small wooden table in front of the house, now coverted into
a museum, and headquarters of the Chico Mendes Foundation, lay the
United Nations Global 500 award Mendes earned in 1987 for his
defense of the environment.
   An elderly rubber tapper stepped forward and silently placed a
small metal rubber tapping knife on the table.
   Rodrigues, who is under police protection because of death
threats, unfolded a map of the Chico Mendes Extractivist Reserve
created by the government last year. The reserve allows rubber
tappers to commercially harvest latex, nuts and other forest
products - a dream of Mendes'.
   A 2-by-2 foot block of fresh concrete was laid on the muddy
ground beside the back door of the house, where Mendes was hit by
the shotgun blast.
   With a wooden stick, a rubber tapper traced the words: ``Here
they killed Chico Mendes. The fight continues.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Haitians jammed polling places at
daybreak Sunday to cast heir ballots in the first democratic
presidential election since the Election Day massacre of 1987.
   Many polling places opened late, but no incidents were reported.
   Former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were among
foreign observers at the Argentine Bellegarde secondary school,
where 14 people died on Nov. 29, 1987. Thugs shot and hacked to
death 34 people during the voting that day and forced elections to
be canceled.
   ``We wanted to come here as a symobolic thing to show the people
of Haiti that it's safe to vote today,'' Carter said.
   The polls opened at 6 a.m. and were to close at 6 p.m.
   Haitians voted for president and elected 110 members of a
bicameral National Assembly, 134 mayors, 268 municipal council
members and 1,695 county officials.
   Runoff elections will be held in late January in races in which
no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote.
   The government on Saturday closed the Dominican border and
barred civilians from carrying weapons. Officials gave no reason
for the border closure, but there has been talk of worry about the
possibility of armed mercenaries crossing the border to disrupt the
election.
   The army urged ``calm and serenity'' and said it would take
whatever measures necessary to ensure a safe election.
   The government, led by President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, also
prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages during the election
period and restricted traffic on Sunday to cars with election
permits and a few bus and taxi companies.
   On Saturday, white vans flying blue-and-white United Nations
flags ferried international election monitors around the city.
   Police stopped cars on John Brown Avenue, the main thoroughfare,
and checked for registration papers, but the security forces were
mostly out of sight.
   There were 800 international observers in Haiti for the
elections.
   ``It looks, as far as anyone can tell, A-OK,'' said Ismael
Diallo of the African nation of Burkina Faso, spokesman for the
130-member U.N. monitoring team, which includes 64 unarmed military
security advisers.
   ``I regret now that I didn't register to vote in October, but I
was too afraid,'' said Huguette Pierre, 24, an unemployed
switchboard operator.
   Haiti's last attempt to hold democratic elections, on Nov. 29,
1987, was aborted when assassins supported by the army shot and
hacked to death at least 34 people at polling stations and in the
streets.
   Subsequent elections in January 1988 were controlled by the army
and boycotted by most leading contenders in the previous election.
   The only disturbance so far in this campaign was a
grenade-and-bomb attack Dec. 5 that killed seven people and wounded
more than 50 others at a campaign rally for the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the apparent front-runner among the 11 presidential
candidates.
   The Electoral Council, revising earlier estimates, said Saturday
that 2,970,000 people, or about 90 percent of those eligible, were
registered to vote.
   The Electoral Council said it did not expect to release any
results before noon Monday.
   Aristide, a leftist Roman Catholic priest with a large following
among the majority poor, was considered a front-runner.
   Although the army has pledged to ensure a smooth election,
sympathizers of the fallen 29-year Duvalier dictatorship oppose any
move toward democratic government.
   Last week, the self-proclaimed head of the Tonton Macoute
militia vowed to prevent an Aristide victory.
   ``We will do everything to prevent this danger,'' said Roger
Lafontant, who himself was barred from contesting the election.
``My country will never be delivered to communism.''
   The Tonton Macoutes violently nforced the Duvalier dictatorship
for 29 years.
   Haiti, an impoverished Caribbean nation of 6 million people, has
been ruled almost exclusively by despots since gaining independence
from France in 1804 after a slave revolt.
   Aristide, 37, was expelled from his ecclesiastical order in 1988
for allegedly preaching class struggle.
   Another popular condidate is former World Bank official Marc
Bazin, seen as a favorite of the Bush administration because of his
international business ties.
   Aristide's anti-imperialist rhetoric has made U.S. officials
wary. But he has presented a moderate, though somewhat vague,
election platform calling for a ``dignified'' relationship between
the two countries.

   A new breed of high-tech radio programmers
think they've found a better way to give music junkies near-perfect
renditions of their favorite hits, from Beethoven to Billy Idol, 24
hours a day.
   It's called digital radio, and one day it may be zipping out of
Earth orbit directly to your car or portable radio or through your
TV set.
   What digital radio promises is impressive: no more hissing
signals fading in and out or booming from the bottom of a barrel.
No pops or crackles. Compact disc-quality sound.
   Several new satellite companies want to offer it; so do
traditional AM and FM radio stations. Some cable companies already
are offering digital radio to subscribers, for a price.
   Because digital radio can produce such a clear sound, the
recording industry is keeping a wary eye on a technology that may
spur home taping.
   But many observers think there's no stopping it.
   Today's radio ``no longer is state of the art sound quality,''
says Robert Mazer, a Washington communications lawyer.
   Digital radio transforms sound into the precise binary pulses of
computers, whereas traditional analog radio changes sound into
electrical signals transmitted as rising and falling waves of
energy.
   Computer technology can reconstruct digital signals into sound
that is a near-perfect copy of the original material, which in the
music industry nowadays typically is a digital compact disc.
   Testing is under way in Japan, Canada and Europe on
satellite-delivered digital radio. In this country, the Federal
Communications Commission is considering whether to set aside a
portion of the already overcrowded airwaves for digital audio
broadcasting.
   Whatever happens, the new system may render existing radios
obsolete.
   Some entrepreneurs are hoping to carve out a market for digital
audio carried over the unused portions of a cable TV system's
wires. The idea has been spreading across the nation slowly since
May when Jerrold Communications rolled out its 17-channel Digital
Cable Radio.
   Two other cable radio offerings - Digital Planet and Digital
Music Express - were demonstrated last month to a cable TV
convention in Anaheim, Calif.
   Carson, Calif.-based Digital Planet began marketing its
26-channel service to a limited number of Continental Cablevision
subscribers in Los Angeles in September. Continental is charging
customers $8 for the service, which offers formats including rock,
classical and jazz, along with radio and cable simulcasts and
several regular radio stations. Some channels have commercials.
   Customers get a tuner that is connected between the incoming
cable and their stereo receiver, where the digital signal is
converted back into analog, with only a slight decrease in sound
quality.
   Although some might wonder why people would pay for what now is
offered basically free on traditional radio, Digital Planet
President William DeLany said subscriber response ``has been just
marvelous.''
   ``There are people out there willing to pay a little extra for
high-quality sound,'' DeLany said in a telephone interview from
Anaheim.
   DeLany said his company originally had projected 2 million
subscribers within two years. But based upon the early results in
Los Angeles, the service may attract double that number in two
years, he said.
   Jerry Rubinstein, chairman of International Cablecasting
Technologies Inc. in New York, said his company has commitments for
the 30-channel Digital Music Express from cable systems
representing 15 million subscribers in Denver, Las Vegas, Nev.,
Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco and St. Louis, Rubinstein said. It
should begin in spring 1991.
   The music will be commercial free and uninterrupted, Rubinstein
said. A computer even will arrange the order in which songs are
played.
   Unlike Digital Planet, which will have ``moderators'' telling
listeners what they're hearing, Digital Music Express will offer an
optional remote control that displays the name of the artist, the
song, album title, record company and catalog number.
   ``The subscriber will have all the information he wants to buy
the CD, be it by phone call or by going into a particular record
store to get it,'' Rubinstein said.
   The cable radio executives said they didn't want to alienate the
record companies. For that reason, they won't publish advance play
lists or play albums end to end.
   The recording industry still fears the introduction of digital
audiotape recorders, particularly when digital radios begin picking
up digital audio broadcasts. To offset the potential loss of
revenues, record manufacturers want a performance royalty or a tax
on tapes or recorders.
   The U.S. Copyright Office is looking into the issue. It also is
considering a proposal that digital radio broadcasts be scrambled,
thereby turning them into subscription-only services.
   Radio stations are urging the FCC to let them provide digital
audio, arguing that satellite delivery would weaken the tenets of
the 1934 Communications Act that enshrines the concept of
``localism.''
   Radio stations also say satellites would siphon away crucial
revenue.
   Satellite broadcasters want to use portions of the radio
spectrum now occupied by UHF-TV channels 57-66. Broadcasters say
that spectrum should be reserved for emerging high-definition TV
service.
   Finding space for digital broadcasts also is going to be a
problem, since digital signals use more of the airwaves than
analog.

   Italian police obtained important
information about Mafia activities by bugging tombs at a cemetery
where family members and friends discussed vendettas, newspapers
reported Sunday.
   The information obtained in the operation helped authorities
obtain orders restricting the movements of 19 people, the papers
said.
   In accordance with new anti-Mafia legislation passed last month,
police were granted permission to plant listening devices in tombs
at the Ercolano cemetery near Naples, where several suspected
members of the Camorra were recently buried.
   The Camorra is the Neapolitan version of the Sicilian Mafia.
   Police monitored plans of vendettas, contracts and other
clandestine operations in the conversations and prayers of widows,
other relatives and friends of the deceased, the accounts said.
   Ercolano, a town a half-mile from Naples, is the site of Roman
archaeological excavations. It also is the site of intense Camorra
activity.
   Two clans have been feuding in the area since last February,
when five bandits looted archaeological sites, taking away more
than 200 priceless artifacts.

   The U.S.-based Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. and a

   Britannica and the Soviet state-owned Progress Publishers have
agreed to begin translating a 12-volume edition of the
encyclopedia. The project is expected to take five years,
Britannica said in a news release.
   ``The publishing of a Russian-language translation is a natural

Europe,'' said Britannica chairman Robert P. Gwinn.
   The statement did not say how much the contract was worth.
   The encyclopedia's section on the Soviet Union will be expanded

will review the contents to uphold ``standards of objectivity,''
the statement said.
   Three editions of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia have been
published since the 1917 revolution, all reflecting and promoting
official government views.

   Lou Saltz is collecting Washington apples -
2,100 cases for troops in the Persian Gulf. ``It's one way to let
them know we're thinking of them,'' says the unemployed truck
driver.
   Bill Slivinski is sending 4,000 pounds of macrame kits. ``I had
an awful lot of friends that were in the Vietnam War,'' the New
Englander says.
   Becky Pickelman packed two pallets full of games, treats and
toiletries donated by fellow Texans. ``Maybe the troops will feel
better knowing that people in the states care,'' says the
29-year-old Wal-Mart worker.
   All across America, self-appointed Christmas elves have
collected cartons of good cheer for the soldiers who will spend
their holidays in the Saudi Arabian desert.
   They're sending everything from soup to nuts - literally.
   The soup, for example, came from Campbell's. It was among the
items rounded up by Jerry Meese, a spray painter in Michigan City,
Ind.
   ``The phones just keep ringing,'' said Lt. Col. Henry Wyatt of
the Defense Logistics Agency. The agency has four people manning a
hotline to coordinate large-scale donations to the troops in the
Persian Gulf.
   ``We're not soliciting these things,'' Wyatt said. ``People just
say, `Hey, I'd like to donate the following.'''
   Many of the largest contributions come from corporate donors and
charitable organizations.
   But throughout the country, individuals are setting aside their
own problems to show their support for the 250,000 troops in Saudi
Arabia.
   In Brewster, Wash., Saltz says he and his wife, Yuvonne, are
``just truck drivers.'' The couple saw stories on TV about groups
sending gifts to the gulf and decided Washington should send
apples.
   ``It's something to do,'' he says. ``Neither of us is working
right now.''
   Saltz and his wife use a borrowed truck to collect donations
from local fruit warehouses and then drove them 150 miles to
Fairchild Air Force Base for the flight to the gulf.
   In Athol, Mass., 72-year-old Al Souza has a living room loaded
with gulf-bound items ranging from sardines and toilet paper to
dart games and volleyballs.
   ``My wife just had surgery and, oh Jesus, I'm telling you I've
been busy,'' says the American Legion commander and World War II
veteran. But he adds, ``When I was overseas, I wished I'd gotten
some of these things.''
   The Defense Logistics Agency reports that hundreds of groups,
individuals and companies have donated millions of dollars in goods
and services for Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Nothing like this happened in Korea or Vietnam,'' says Lt.
Col. Wyatt.
   People who donate large quantities of items arrange to get the
material to Defense Department depots on the East or West coast,
and the government takes care of shipments from there. Most items
go by sea, and take 30 days to reach Saudi Arabia.
   Yet with the deadline for Christmas shipments now past, calls to
the donations hotline show no signs of slowing down, Wyatt said.
   Some well-intentioned items have been turned away, including
offers of lobster, bottled water and live Christmas trees. But the
variety of items accepted includes a broad variety of foods and
novelty items ranging from ``Klika'' toys to Klondike bars.
   Even stock brokers are getting involved. Gordon Platt, a GHM
Inc. specialist's clerk on the floor of the American Stock
Exchange, collected enough donations from his colleagues to buy
1,200 tins of cookies. Then he rented a truck and delivered them to
a Defense Department depot in Pennsylvania.
   ``I just felt I wanted to do what I could to bring the holidays
a little closer to these guys,'' said Platt, who has some friends
among the troops.
   Becky Pickelman feels blessed to have her husband and family
with her at Christmas but she sympathizes with Wal-Mart co-workers
in New Braunfels, Texas, whose loved ones are stationed in the
gulf.
   ``We pretty much saw what they were going through, knowing that
they are here alone and their husbands, uncles and brothers are
alone there,'' she said.
   So Mrs. Pickelman and her friends arranged to run some free
radio and newspaper ads and rounded up cartons full of candy,
stationery, games and food.
   ``It's going to cut it close, but they should be getting them
the week before Christmas,'' she said recently.
   In Illinois, half the students at Flossmoor High School came to
school on the Columbus Day holiday to make boutineers for troops in
the gulf. The football team arrived en masse. Other school and
community groups did likewise.
   ``The kids were incredible,'' said school spokeswoman Jayne
Mathews. ``It was a great day to get all these people together.''
   In Massachusetts, 46-year-old Slivinski said he knew just what
he should do to aid the gulf effort. As president of Pepperell
Braiding Co., he arranged to send the troops kits of macrame-style
knotting projects.
   ``It's the same stuff that sailors did in the 1600s, 1500s and
even 1400s on sailing vessels,'' he said.

   The Czechoslovak airline CSA on Sunday
became the first foreign airline to resume flights to Beirut since
the city was reunified and the warring militias withdrawn.
   Civil aviation sources said a CSA Tupolev jet carrying 65
passengers landed at Beirut in the morning, resuming the airline's
weekly service after a three-year suspension.
   The Soviet Aeroflot, Bulgaria's Balkan Airlines and Syrian Arab
Airlines were the only carriers to maintain flights to Beirut in
recent years. Most of the others suspended their flights after
terrorist attacks by Moslem Shiite extremists in 1984.
   Security conditions have improved in Beirut since the
reunification of the city and the withdrawal of warring Moslem and
Christian militias.
   Reunification was the first step in an Arab League-brokered plan
to end Lebanon's 15 years of civil war.
   Civil aviation sources said they were hopeful that western
airlines would resume flights to Beirut next year.

<TEXT>
   A KGB official speaking at a Moscow factory
last year was asked why Mikhail Gorbachev was ``surrounded by two
rows of worried-looking guys trying to look in all directions.''
   His answer, according to Soviet news reports, was that ``there
is terrorism and there are all kinds of psychological disorders
resulting from constant stress.''
   The Kremlin, in other words, is getting a taste of its own
medicine.
   After supporting international terrorism for decades to
destabilize the United States and its allies, the Soviet leadership
is being confronted with a growing wave of terrorist activity from
within, U.S. counterterrorism experts say.
   The same political relaxation that has given birth to
unprecedented democratic reforms in the 15 Soviet republics also
has lifted the lid on long-repressed aspirations and grievances.
   The result has been a general breakdown of law and order,
ranging from New York-style muggings to sophisticated political
terrorism.
   The terrorists run the gamut from nationalists seeking
independence for their republics, to groups distressed by worsening
economic shortages, to individuals unable to cope with the rapid
changes in Soviet society.
   The KGB, the country's internal security agency, is taking the
lead in handling the threat. But ``the problem is bedeviling
Gorbachev and the central leadership and they're hard pressed to
respond,'' said Dick Combs, a staff member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee who studies the political implications of
terrorism.
   Intelligence files made available by the new governments of
Eastern Europe are confirming long-held suspicions of Western
counterterrorism officials: the Soviet-led Communist bloc
supported, and in some cases sponsored, Palestinian, European and
South American terrorism.
   For example, the communist government of East Germany knew of
plans by Libyan-backed agents to bomb a discotheque in West Berlin
four years ago, according to Dennis Pluchinsky of the State
Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security. The 1986 attack killed
one American serviceman and led to a U.S. bombing raid on Libya.
   But now that the threat has turned against them, Soviet leaders
have been eager to cooperate with the West in countering
international terrorism, American officials say.
   And they also have asked for help to combat their domestic
threat, said one official. Western agencies, however, have turned
them down, citing reluctance to entangle themselves with domestic
Soviet strife, said the official, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   The list of incidents is long. It is made more startling by the
new openness of the media, which as recently as last year was
banned from publishing any news of attacks on authorities.
   In the Caucasus, nationalists blew up railroad cars and tracks
several times last summer; for two years running, the May Day
ceremonies in Moscow have been disrupted by political malcontents
throwing firebombs; the Soviet airline Aeroflot suffered 13
hijackings or attempted hijackings last summer and has received
more than 100 bomb threats this year.
   Yuri Plekhanov, head of the KGB unit that protects Gorbachev,
said recently that every month his agents arrest more than 10
citizens ``with criminal intentions.''
   The head of the KGB in the Ukraine, N.M. Golushko, said recently
that ``one cannot ignore the real danger of nuclear terrorism,
attacks on nuclear plants and crimes committed using radioactive
material.''
   ``Although counterterrorism measures have been introduced, they
have been impeded by the government's progressively enfeebled grip
on society,'' said Gabriel Schoenfeld, a senior fellow at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
   Schoenfeld, an expert on internal Soviet affairs, said attempts
to control the threat have been further hampered by backward
technology and shortage of everything from walkie-talkies to metal
detectors.
   For example, the police need 900,000 batteries every year - yet
central planners in Moscow have promised only 150,000 for 1990, he
said.
   For the time being, the terrorist threat may be checked by the
very flaws that created it:
   The unreliable telephone and travel network presents
difficulties for planners of terrorist incidents. So do the strict
controls still in place on internal travel, and the low-technology
weaponry available on the black market.
   But further liberalization could benefit terrorists, Schoenfeld
said.
   In the meantime, Soviet officials are coming clean about past
support for terrorists, said the State Department's Pluchinsky.
They have said, for example, that the notorious Marxist radical
known as Carlos, who terrorized Europe in the 1970s in the pay of
Palestinian groups, was granted asylum in communist Hungary.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Denounces Vietnam, Phnom Penh Ahead of Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Days before a scheduled meeting of
Cambodia's warring factions, the Khmer Rouge on Sunday accused
Vietnam and the government it installed in Phnom Penh of trying to
destroy a U.N. peace framework.
   ``The Vietnamese enemy aggressors and their traitorous lackey
puppets are more arrogantly manipulating to block peace efforts,''
Khmer Rouge radio said.
   A translation of the broadcast was seen in Bangkok.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - The
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, China and France - agreed
on a draft framework for Cambodian peace in late November.
   But despite international efforts, Cambodian premier Hun Sen's
government and the three guerrilla armies fighting it have made few
strides toward reconciliation.
   The Communist Khmer Rouge is the strongest guerrilla faction.
   Hun Sen has agreed to meet the guerrillas in Paris Friday to
discuss the Security Council document, but both he and Vietnam have
indicated they are unhappy with it.
   Vietnam on Friday called the draft ``a violation of the goal and
principles of the U.N. charter,'' and said it had ``no essential
points that may lead to consensus.''
   It also said it did not deal with the need to ``eliminate
forever the genocidal regime'' of the Khmer Rouge, which ruled by
terror before Vietnam's invasion in 1979 ended its 3{-year regime.
   The Security Council plan envisions a large U.N. peacekeeping
role in general elections. The original version was proposed in
late August and agreed to in principle by the Cambodian factions.
   But Hun Sen has said since that the military contingent proposed
under the plan should not be a peacekeeping force or a heavily
armed fighting unit.
   He also has insisted that the U.N. supervision of key Phnom Penh
ministries under the plan be limited.
   Hun Sen has agreed to meet the guerrillas as a member of the
Supreme National Council, conceived under the U.N. plan and made up
of representatives from all four factions.
   Its only meeting, in Bangkok in mid-September, broke up after it
failed to agree on the role of guerrilla coalition leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk.
   A brief report on non-Communist guerrilla radio Sunday quoted
sources in Paris as saying Sihanouk had decided he no longer would
accept the chairmanship or membership on the council.

   Cartoonist Garry Trudeau, whose
``Doonesbury'' cartoon strip has focused on the Persian Gulf crisis
in recent months, says the rest of the nation is just as obsessed
with the topic as he is.
   ``Normally I'd get some mail,'' he said, explaining that he
usually hears criticism from his fans when he concentrates on a
single topic. But not this time, he said.
   ``It's an indication of just how much this is on everybody's
minds,'' Trudeau said Saturday. ``You turn on any talk radio show,
and it's all we've been hearing, especially near the holidays.''
   The usually publicity-shy Trudeau spent two hours Saturday
signing copies of his latest collection of cartoons, ``Recycled
Doonesbury,'' at the Yale University bookstore.
   The collection marks the 20th anniversary of Trudeau's
syndicated cartoon strip, which appears in more than 1,200
newspapers. He began the strip as an undergraduate at Yale, where
it appeared in the Yale Daily News as ``Bull Tales.''
   During the book-signing session, Trudeau met several
second-generation fans, including one Yale student who said he
learned everything he knows about former President Nixon and
Watergate from ``Doonesbury.''
   Trudeau cautioned that his version of history is not complete.
   ``There may be a few holes here and there,'' he joked.

   DOWNEY, Calif. (AP) - ``L.A. Law'' star Corbin Bernsen quickened
the pulses of more than a few patients at Rancho Los Amigos Medical
Center when he and several other celebrities dropped by to spread a
little holiday cheer.
   Hospital spokeswoman Susan Miranda said Saturday's celebrity
roll call included actors Ed Asner, Kirk Cameron, George Kennedy,
Donna Mills and Dick Sargent. But she added that Bernsen, who plays
sleazy divorce lawyer Arnie Becker, was the most popular.
   ``He's the one that all the fuss is being made of,'' she said.
   Annual holiday visits to the hospital in this Los Angeles suburb
began 21 years ago, organized by the late Allen Ludden, who was the
longtime host of the TV game show ``Password.''
   Actress Betty White, who is Ludden's widow, headed this year's
event.

   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Former heavyweight boxing champion James
``Buster'' Douglas and his wife, Bertha, are the parents of a baby
boy.
   The baby, Cardae, weighed 6 pounds, 10 ounces and measured 20{
inches when he was born at 8:45 p.m. Saturday at Grant Medical
Center.
   Mother and baby were in good condition, said nursing supervisor
Joyce Merringer.
   The child is the couple's first. Douglas has a son by a previous
marriage. Douglas, 30, shocked the boxing world when he defeated
previously unbeaten champion Mike Tyson with a 10th-round knockout
in Tokyo on Feb. 10. But he lost to Evander Holyfield in his first
title defense on Oct. 25 in Las Vegas.

   LONDON (AP) - Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the 6th Duke of
Westminster, says it isn't easy being Britain's richest man, adding
he has to put up with the jealousy of many of his countrymen.
   Although Grosvenor, 39, won't say exactly how much money he has,
his fortune has been estimated at $8 billion.
   ``We have never released how much the estate is worth ... but
clearly it does cause envy,'' he said in an interview Sunday on
British Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``I am acutely aware of that, and
how one combats it I don't know. Envy is a human failing.''
   In addition to huge property holdings in London, the duke is a
director of Claridges Hotel Ltd., Sun Alliance and the London
Group.
   Inheriting such responsibility never gave him the chance to pick
his own career or determine his own lifestyle, the duke complained.
   But he noted that being rich isn't all bad, adding he received
500 marriage proposals by the time he was 21.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Actress Kathy Baker says critics have
been using the ``f'' word to describe her performance in the new
movie ``Edward Scissorhands,'' and she couldn't be happier.
   ``That's `f' for `funny,''' Ms. Baker said in a recent
interview. ``This is my first screen comedy. Until now there was
this attitude in Hollywod that Kathy Baker can't do comedy.''
   In ``Scissorhands,'' Johnny Depp plays a creature built by
Vincent Price who has blades instead of fingers. Ms. Baker's
predatory suburban housewife fails to seduce him, then claims he
attacked her.
   Before ``Scissorhands,'' moviegoers saw her in such darker films
as ``Jacknife'' with Robert De Niro; ``Clean and Sober'' with
Michael Keaton; and ``Dad'' with Ted Danson and Jack Lemmon. The
National Society of Film Critics named her best supporting actress
in 1987 for her role as a prostitute in ``Street Smart.''
   She and her husband and two children have taken an apartment in
Kansas City while she makes the movie ``Article 99'' about a staff
rebellion at a Veterans Administration hospital.
   ``I'm only infrequently recognized on the street, and if people
do recognize me, they can't say why,'' she said. ``I've never been
in a movie that has been a big hit, and often even if people think
they know me, they can't remember just which movie it was.''

   Bill Drengler has the grim task this holiday
season of writing wills for soldiers being prepared for duty in the
Persian Gulf.
   It's an ironic task for a man who 20 years ago dropped out of
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and opposed U.S. involvement
in the Vietnam War. Feeling he owed his country, he joined the
National Guard as a lawyer 18 months ago.
   ``The more I do this, the more it is hitting home to me that I
may not see some of these faces again if the Gulf situation blows
up,'' a somber Drengler said.
   He said he remembers the gripping images of the Vietnam War on
television as if it happened yesterday. Asked if those memories
made his Guard assignment more difficult, Drengler, a first
lieutenant, paused several seconds.
   ``It probably makes it harder,'' he said. ``I had friends who
came home dead.''
   Drengler, 41, is one of 17 Guard lawyers in Wisconsin assigned
to advise soldiers activated for Operation Desert Shield, the U.S.
troop buildup in the Persian Gulf that followed Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Capt. Scott Meske, a military spokesman in Madison, said 300
Wisconsin National Guard soldiers are in Saudi Arabia and 700
others are being trained at Fort McCoy for likely duty there.
   In all, the United States has at least 230,000 soldiers,
Marines, sailors and airmen in Saudi Arabia and is sending about
200,000 more.
   Capt. Terence McArdle, assistant staff judge advocate for the
Wisconsin National Guard in Madison, estimated his officers have
written up to 2,000 wills for Guard members, military reservists
and their spouses since the call-up began in August. He said he has
done about 200 himself.
   ``It does get to you in time. There is no question about that,''
McArdle said. ``You realize the consequences that these people are
facing.''
   A United Nations resolution authorizes the use of force after
Jan. 15 if Iraq doesn't withdraw from Kuwait.
   Drengler, whose full-time job is as corporation counsel for
Marathon County, needed waivers because of his age before the Guard
accepted his enlistment last year.
   In college, he dropped out of Air Force ROTC in 1969.
   ``Like many people of my age of that generation, I had
reservations about the Vietnam experience,'' he said. He said he
was vocal in his opposition, but wasn't a ``brick-throwing
protester or anything like that.''
   Over time, he has moved back toward the military, including
serving as chairman of the Marathon County Draft Board.
   ``I generally believe we should perform some sort of national
service,'' Drengler said, sitting in front of a small American flag
tacked on an office wall above pictures of his three children.
   Most soldiers have confronted the possibility of being killed
before they talk to him about a will, he said. But he conceded the
document reinforces the realities of combat.
   ``Most of them really do exhibit a more positive attitude than
you might imagine,'' he said. ``A portion of them do act like they
are in a bit of a daze.''
   Spouses show the most emotion, he said. ``Some are scared. Some
are upbeat. And some are angry.''
   More than half the soldiers called up need wills and almost all
sign one, Drengler said. He said he has helped arrange at least
100.
   ``I always try to tell these people ... that writing a will
doesn't mean you have one foot closer to the grave,'' he said.
   ``What it really means is you have thought about your family and
planned for any eventuality. As basic as that may sound, it seems
to lend some sort of reassurance.''

   Islamic conservatives are
complaining about how the country is run and questioning the wisdom
of letting hundreds of thousands of foreign troops into the
country, Saudi and diplomatic sources report.
   The sources point to several incidents in which the Muttawa, or
religious police, have cracked down on what they consider
unacceptable behavior in this theocratic Islamic state.
   Conservatives have not dared criticize the ruling al-Saud family
by name, but a Muttawa officer recently gave a princess a public
tongue-lashing for the way her foreign maid was dressed.
   A Muttawa raiding party recently scaled the wall of a perfume
manufacturer's mansion in Jiddah after apparently being told there
were unmarried women and liquor at a party there.
   The Muttawa, usually armed with sticks but sometimes with guns,
took along an Islamic judge who gave some partygoers jail sentences
of up to two years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Among them were several Saudi military officers and an interpreter</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   who translated for King Fahd during President Bush's Thanksgiving
visit.
   A diplomatic party in Riyadh was raided by the Muttawa in
November.
   Un-Islamic behavior like the consumption of alcohol, mixed
socializing and immodest dress are particular targets.
   Saudi Arabia's ruling princes must balance demands from the
grassroots Moslem puritans who brought the al-Saud family to power
and the desire for change among the educated elite.
   Some liberals have come to believe the presence of so many
foreigners can accelerate change in a kingdom that has clung
doggedly to Islamic tradition.
   Four months after Western troops arrived, a backlash may be
developing.
   Underground cassettes criticize the government. They ask
indirect questions about state spending and use historical
allegories to make political points.
   One says an 11th century Islamic king in Spain invited a
stronger king to protect him against a third and the stronger king
decided to stay. In other words, it is questioning whether U.S.
troops will leave when asked.
   The tapes cite U.S. studies during the Arab oil embargo in 1973
on how to take over the oilfields, lending support to a theory that
Washington planned the current crisis for that purpose.
   Questions are being asked about the estimated $200 billion spent
on defense. Despite a high-tech arsenal, the Saudi military was not
able to confront Saddam Hussein when he took Kuwait.
   That prompted government announcements that the army had been
ordered not to fight Iraq in order to avoid spilling the blood of
fellow Arabs.
   After Fahd invited the Americans and their allies to defend the
kingdom, he sought a ruling, or fatwa, from religious scholars that
Islamic law allowed the use of non-Moslems soldiers in times of
peril.
   ``They couldn't criticize the deployment of foreign forces
because the king wanted it,'' a long-term Arab resident said.
   Like everyone else interviewed, he spoke on condition of
anonymity due to the sensitive nature of political issues.
   Last month, about 40 women drove cars through the capital in
unprecedented protest of a ban on women driving.
   Zealous mullahs, or clergymen, responded that the women should
be divorced and publicly flogged for defying tradition. Some tried
to link the event to the American Embassy by circulating an
invitation to a dinner dance there, another taboo, that allegedly
was found in a driver's purse.
   ``The atmosphere in the country is charged,'' a Saudi official
said. ``The liberals are demanding more say in the government and
the conservatives are saying `We're being run over'.''
   No public means of debate is available. The press is muzzled and
political parties are illegal.
   ``People who are Westernized don't have a forum to meet and
exert pressure,'' the long-time resident noted. ``The other group
has heritage, institutions, a party line, so they'll always have an
edge in the struggle,'' Diplomats say the religious element is not
a focused opposition likely to oust the king, as happened in Iran
in 1979. The royal family has ``the power to put on the brakes,'' a
Western envoy observed.
   Warrior predecessors of the zealots - the Ikhwan, or brothers,
who helped unify the kingdom in the 1920s - tried to rebel against
King Abdul Aziz in 1929. He crushed them.
   Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina, are in Saudi Arabia
and a king who uses the title The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
cannot ignore religious issues.
   ``How can you claim to be the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques
and bring in an idea that clashes with the Islamic Sharia?'' said
an Islamic scholar, referring to religious law. ``It's too
sensitive.''
   Princes in important government posts acknowledge that some
questioning is valid, but said most critics don't understand the
Iraqi threat.
   ``The people who are really against (foreign troops) have no
ground to stand on,'' a ranking prince said. He claimed they had no
effect on public opinion.

<TEXT>
   Rear Adm. Riley D. Mixson,
commander of the U.S. Navy task force in the Red Sea, says Saddam
Hussein is acting as if he's preparing for war. So Mixson is doing
likewise.
   The admiral, a decorated Vietnam War combat pilot, said the
Iraqi president should think ``long and hard'' before confronting
the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf region.
   ``All we see from (Saddam's) side is that he's sending more
troops to Kuwait. He's showing no signs of withdrawal,'' Mixson
said at a weekend briefing aboard the aircraft carrier USS John F.
Kennedy in the northern Red Sea. ``He's dispersing his forces and
acting as if he's preparing for war.''
   But, he said, ``I have never known of an adversary to be in such
a disadvantageous position as he is right now.''
   As Mixson spoke, the thud of A-6 attack bombers, A-7 light
attack aircraft and F-14 fighters landing on the Kennedy's flight
deck reverberated through the carrier. A normal carrier wing
includes about 70 combat aircraft.
   Mixson said he hoped for peace, but was braced for war.
   ``Those of us in the military hope more, probably than anyone
else in the world, for a peaceful resolution,'' he said. ``But I
would say ... it's no better than a 50-50 chance for peace, and
maybe a little worse than that.''
   The biggest U.S. naval fleet since World War II is assembling in
the gulf region. By Jan. 15 - the U.N. deadline for Iraq to pull
out of Kuwait or face possible use of force - the United States
will have three carriers in the Red Sea and three in the Persian
Gulf, said Cmdr. Jack Ahart, the Kennedy's operations officer.
   If war comes, he said, two carriers would deploy round-the-clock
combat flights while the third would remain on standby.
   Mixson said he believed that in the event of all-out conflict,
air power would be ``very, very decisive.'' But he said it wouldn't
singlehandedly win a war.
   ``There are those who say that we'll bring them to their knees
in two weeks. There are others who think it might go on a little
longer,'' he said.
   ``They (Iraq) certainly are a war-experienced nation. I think if
we do get into a ground war, that could get very, very bloody and I
hope that we can avoid that with an all-out ... assault,'' said
Mixson.
   Mixson said Iraqi air tactics have become more sophisticated
since the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
   ``They're practicing more at night,'' he said. ``They understand
the threat that he's up against. He (Saddam) understands that
business as usual, or business as before, won't hack it against the
forces that we have over here.''
   ``He has a fairly sophisticated electronic capability, although
not as well-maintained and without the expertise of using that
capability that we have. So I think he'll have problems there,''
the admiral said.
   By mid-January, the United States and its allies will have more
than 600,000 troops in the gulf, facing the million-member Iraqi
army, including 480,000 troops in the Kuwaiti theater.
   Lt. Gen. Khalid Bin Sultan, the Saudi commander of Arab forces,
said Saturday Iraq has moved 50,000 additional troops into the
Kuwaiti theater in the past two weeks.
   Mixson said the task force's mission ``is to keep our pilots,
our ships, on edge so we are ready at a moment's notice to conduct
strikes against Iraq.''

   The Czechoslovaks are the
smallest ground contingent in the multinational force deployed in
the Saudi desert. But their presence is a sign of tremendous
changes in the world order.
   The 170 Czechoslovaks, who form a chemical decontamination unit,
completed their deployment this weekend. It is the first time in
decades that Czechoslovak troops are serving outside the former
East bloc.
   ``We are here with our small force to defend peace in this
area,'' said Maj. Ivan Pavlov. ``This is a great experience for us.
We are here to cooperate with the Americans and the Saudis.''
   Desert warfare is a strange new notion for the Czechoslovak
troops, whose caps are constructed with earflaps to keep them warm
during harsh Eastern European winters.
   ``This is the first time since World War II Czechoslovak troops
have gone overseas, and the first time we have ever been in the
desert,'' said Pavlov.
   He and his countrymen were officially welcomed by Saudi Lt. Gen.
Khalid bin Sultan, commander of all the Arab forces and nephew of
King Fahd. At the welcoming ceremony Saturday night, Czechoslovak
soldiers stood at attention in formation on a Saudi basketball
court.
   With the toppling of Czechoslovakia's Communist government in a
peaceful revolution last year, Czechoslovaks have a new role to
play in the world, Pavlov said.
   That includes close cooperation with Western countries viewed as
the enemy by their former government.
   ``It is a very big change for us,'' said Pavlov.
   He said Czechoslovakia, too, has a stake in resolving the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``If we don't stop Saddam Hussein now, there will be war in the
Middle East and maybe in the world,'' Pavlov said.
   High oil prices brought on by the gulf crisis are already
causing hardship in Czechoslovakia, which is struggling with the
difficult transition to a market economy.
   In the Saudi desert, the Czechoslovak chemical-decontamination
unit stands ready to decontaminate vehicles, equipment and
airstrips if they fall under attack from chemical weapons.
   The unit, made up of five different detachments, will remain in
eastern Saudi Arabia for 10 months, officers said.
   ``This is a very dangerous job. We must be prepared,'' said
Pavlov.

   A power outage caused a small fire
and halted work on the Atlantis and Discovery space shuttles about
16 hours over the weekend, Kennedy Space Center officials said.
   A relay in the power supply system at the space center
apparently overheated and failed Friday night, interrupting power
to the Launch Control Center.
   The relay's failure resulted in a small fire in an electrical
panel on the control center's first floor. Firefighters quickly
extinguished the blaze, center spokesman Bruce Buckingham said.
   No one was hurt, and no other key equipment was damaged, he
said.
   Without electricity to power computers in the control center's
firing rooms - from which the shuttle fleet's systems are
constantly monitored - technicians in the nearby Orbiter Processing
Facility were forced to stop work on Atlantis and Discovery.
   Workers replaced the failed relay and returned to normal
operations by Saturday afternoon, said John Williams, a spokesman
for Lockheed Space Operations Co., the contractor responsible for
preparing shuttles for launch.
   Managers are confident the lost work can be made up so neither
shuttle's next launch is delayed.

<HEAD>Iraq Reported Closer Than Thought To Having Nuclear Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two German scientists who visited Iraq say
President Saddam Hussein has acquired enough Western technology to
produce a nuclear bomb in 1991 or 1992, the Sunday Times reported.
   The newspaper quoted scientists Bruno Stemmler and Walter Busse
as saying Iraqi scientists had built a factory northwest of Baghdad
for producing nuclear centrifuges, which are essential for making
weapons-grade uranium.
   The scientists said the Iraqis also had built a
uranium-enrichment laboratory in the southern outskirts of the
capital.
   Stemmler visited Iraq in the fall of 1987 and he and Busse went
there together in the summer of 1988, the report said. Both were
then employed by MAN Technologie of the former West Germany and
were in Iraq to advise on its nuclear program.
   Based on the information, the newspaper said Iraq could have
nuclear capability next year or the year after, at least three
years sooner than Western intelligence agencies had previously
thought.
   ``Even if Saddam were to withdraw his forces from Kuwait, his
nuclear capability will shortly pose a deadly serious threat to
stability in the region,'' the report said.
   The Sunday Times said technology for the two plants was provided
``by at least a dozen Western companies'' wich filled orders from
Iraqi firms that were cover operations for securing nuclear weapons
know-how.
   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency failed to
discover the existence of the laboratory when its representatives
visited Iraq last month, the report said.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers patrolled major cities Sunday
following two days of rioting prompted by demands for higher wages,
and government opponents insisted the death toll was higher than
the official figure of five.
   Unconfirmed claims from union leaders and human rights groups
asserted that anywhere from 25 to more than 100 people had been
killed in the city of Fez.
   The government said rioting Friday in Fez killed five people,
including a policeman, and injured 127 people, mostly police. A
hospital supervisor in Fez, Dr. Hassan Houari, said Sunday the
government figures were accurate.
   Scores of people were reported injured in other cities during a
nationwide, one-day general strike Friday to demand higher wages.
   The violence continued in Fez on Saturday with arson attacks on
vehicles and a police station, but there were no reports of renewed
clashes.
   Major cities were reported calm but uneasy Sunday, with security
forces deployed at major intersections and guarding public
buildings. In Fez, charred buses lay in the streets and soldiers in
armored vehicles patrolled areas where looting had occurred.
   A few minor disturbances, including stone-throwing and
spontaneous demonstrations, were reported in Fez and Rabat late
Saturday and early Sunday.
   In Paris, human rights groups that monitor events in Morocco
claimed the death toll was far higher than the government figure.
   One of them, The Action Committee for the Liberation of Moroccan
Political Prisoners, said 80 people were killed and about 1,000
arrested. The government reported 210 arrests.
   The unions which organized the general strike vowed to combat
``government terrorism.'' They said the violence resulted because
security forces ``resorted to intimidation, provocation and
repression.''
   The government, however, said police in Fez suffered heavy
casualties because they exercised restraint, using warning shots,
tear gas and clubs to disperse rioters.
   Authorities said a policeman was fatally stabbed when his unit
was surrounded by rioters, and a civilian was crushed to death by
stampeding protesters during a police charge.
   Fez, the religious and intellectual center of Morocco, suffered
extensive damage from looting and arson. The national news agency,
MAP, said looters armed with chains and iron bars ransacked jewelry
stores, banks and public buildings.
   The rioters set about 50 buses and cars on fire and burned the
deluxe Merindes Hotel, the agency said. It said some rioters
reached a lounge on the fifth floor of the hotel and carried off
the stocks of liquor.
   The unions claimed 80 percent of workers observed the strike
call. The government, which had tried to ban the strike, said only
a handful of businesses and factories were affected.
   But authorities confirmed the strike was widely observed on
university campuses, where at least 40 percent of classes were
canceled.
   The estimated 20,000 protesters in Fez included many university
students and other youths. According to official figures, the
unemployment rate for Moroccans under 21 has risen to 31 percent,
compared with an overall rate of 16 percent.
   Al-Bayane, a Communist opposition newspaper, said Sunday that
hotels and luxury shops were attacked because young demonstrators
resented a widening gap between Morocco's rich and poor.
   ``Government policy has given Morocco an image of crisis and
grave weakness,'' Al-Bayane said. ``It's high time for change.''
   Thousands of workers who took part in general strikes in 1979
and 1981 were fired or arrested. The 1981 strike led to riots in
Casablanca in which at least 66 people were killed.

<HEAD>Salman Rushdie Says He is Paying Towards His Own Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie said Sunday he has contributed
nearly $200,000 towards the security he has needed since the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death for allegedly
blaspheming Islam.
   Rushdie has ben in hiding since the Iranian revolutionary
leader issued the death call in February 1989, saying Rushdie's
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' defamed the religion.
   In a statement through his lawyer, Rushdie said he had decided
to break his silence about the financing of his protection because
of ``new suggestions and allegations'' about it.
   The Sunday Express quoted colleagues of Rushdie's police guards
as saying the officials have to pay Rushdie toward their
accommodation and food at the privately rented hideouts.
   In the statement, lawyer Bernard Simon said it was time to ``set
the record straight'' on the financing of Rushdie's protection.
   ``Mr. Rushdie was advised at the outset of his protection that
he would be required personally to bear most of the cost of the
accommodation provided for him. This he gladly agreed to do,'' he
said.
   ``The protection has now been in force for over 22 months and
during this period Mr. Rushdie's own financial contribution to the
costs of his protection has been in the region of 100,000 pounds
($193,000).''
   Also Sunday, a leading British Moslem warned that Rushdie still
risks being killed if he makes further public appearances.
   Dr. Shabir Akthar of the Bradford Council of Mosques, a major
Moslem forum, said in a BBC interview that British Moslems were not
officially calling for Rushdie's death.
   But Britain's Moslem community was very diverse, he said. ``It
does not take all its direction from any single authority and
individuals may take the law into their own hands.''
   Rushdie, an Indian-born author and British national, emerged
from hiding briefly on Dec. 5 to sign copies of his new book,
``Haroun and the Sea of Stories,'' at a north London bookstore.

<HEAD>New Prime Minister Steers A Skillful Course Back To Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Major changed little of substance in his
international debut in Europe as the new British prime minister.
But by the end of it, everything seemed different.
   The battles of Margaret Thatcher's era, just three weeks past,
were a fading memory as the mild-mannered Major cautiously nudged
Britain toward an end to its long isolation in the European
Community.
   Major, 47, arrived at the two-day European Community summit with
one big advantage in the eyes of the 11 other leaders bruised by
the bitter confrontations with Britain over European union. He
wasn't Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``The position of the new British government could be summed up
by saying they feel they are Europeans,'' commented West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   From Kohl, a powerful world figure, to leaders of small
countries like Ireland's Prime Minister Charles Haughey, the others
went out of their way to welcome the man who replaced the Western
world's longest serving leader.
   Major came to Rome a virtually unknown to most of the them -
hovering diffidently on the edge of the photo line-ups in which the
Mrs. Thatcher traditionally stood center-stage.
   Occasionally there was a recognition problem. Italian officials
said they searched for Major to say goodbye at the end of Friday's
night banquet at the Renaissance Chigi Palace and then found he'd
left unnoticed.
   In contrast to the robust exchanges with Mrs. Thatcher that
marked most summits, Major ran out of superlatives Saturday to
describe the atmosphere among the 12 EC leaders - ``extremely good
... very friendly ... extremely positive.''
   ``We ... intend to be wholeheartedly engaged in the enterprise
of building, shaping and developing Europe,'' he said.
   Italian officials enthused that ``all 12 are on board.'' Kohl
and Major were on first-name terms before the end of their first
one-on-one meeting.
   The German leader explained that he was pressing for European
union partly to allay fears of the newly united Germany in a
continent ravaged by World War II.
   Major, the first British leader too young to remember any of the
1939-45 conflict, replied tactfully that ``most people of my
generation and younger take a very positive view of the
community.''
   At least for now, his new style seemed to open a new era.
   But underneath the smiles and the unassuming demeanor, Major
stuck to Mrs. Thatcher's fundamental objections to radical plans
for a single European currency and closer political ties that could
lead to a federal-type Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher said neither she nor the British Parliament would
accept that kind of loss of sovereignty.
   But it was the way Mrs. Thatcher said it that precipitated her
downfall. After a confrontation over single currency plans at the
last community summit in October, her deputy, Geoffrey Howe,
resigned, accusing Mrs. Thatcher of undermining Britain's national
interest. Howe's move provoked a leadership challenge.
   The currency plan, starting with a single central bank by 1994,
is still ticking away with latent British disapproval. It is the
most ominous of the potential time bombs the community leaders left
behind after the second Rome summit.
   The other major sign that the honeymoon could soon be over was
the all-options-included communique on political union that
appeared designed not to offend anyone.
   It encompassed the pro-federalists' hopes for the community to
take over a whole range of domestic matters such as health and
education, to Britain's distinctly more modest ideas.
   These include closer cooperation on foreign and defense policy,
and giving the community's executive body, the European Commission,
the power to monitor community spending and implementation of
jointly made decisions.
   Two intergovernmental conferences that began Saturday are
charged with turning this over next year into final proposals
everyone can accept. Before then, many analysts believe, the
honeymoon could be over.
   Major has remained loyal to Mrs. Thatcher, the leader who
plucked him from an simple bench in Parliament and appointed him to
a series of senior posts.
   But just at the end of the summit, when a reporter suggested
that Mrs. Thatcher was wrong when she slighted a British compromise
proposal on the single currency, Major gave an inch. ``Who can
tell?'' he said.

<HEAD>On Old, Old Cape Cod: Settlement Predates Pilgrims By Thousands Of

<TEXT>
   The ``welcome'' sign at the border of this
small Cape Cod town reads: ``Settled by Pilgims in 1644.''
   But archaeologists have found evidence the date is really 8,000
years before that, when ancestors of today's Indians formed a
settlement here.
   Unusually high tides last month sliced through 15 feet of sandy
dunes on Coast Guard Beach, part of the Cape Cod National Seashore.
The tide uncovered what archaeologists say is a portion of the
oldest undisturbed example of a prehistoric settlement ever found
in the Northeast.
   ``We consider it kind of a miniature Pompeii,'' said Mike
Whatley, the park's supervisory ranger.
   But with more high tides expected on New Year's Eve, the seaside
window into the past could quickly close. So a team of
archaeologists is frantically working in freezing temperatures and
high winds to excavate the site.
   ``It's an emergency excavation. Just about everyone on our
payroll is down here,'' said Linda Towle, archaeology supervisor
for the National Park Service's North Atlantic Region.
   In their rush to save the treasure buried on the beach, the
scientists have yet to spend much time evaluating what they've
found.
   They believe, however, that the area was used about 8,000 years
ago by a small group of people who moved from one place to another
depending on the season.
   Ice covered all of New England until about 15,000 years ago.
After the glaciers retreated, scientists say, the first human
beings started arriving 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.
   Arrowheads and spear points found at the site indicate that this
particular group of Cape Codders was made up of hunters, most
likely of deer, moose and bear.
   The dim outline of post holes, apparently part of a wall,
suggests a shelter was constructed using saplings stuck into the
ground and covered with reed mats, bark or fur. A pond just to the
south would have furnished water and freshwater fish, Towle said.
   ``They were fully evolved human beings,'' she said. ``They are
racially the ancestors of the American Indians who were here when
the Europeans arrived.''
   Although Cape Code is now a popular site for summer homes, the
settlers appear to have built their homes for winter use.
   Park service rules limit excavation of sites unless they are
threatened, so the archaeologists here don't have carte blanche to
dig up the entire area. Whatley said it is believed that the
settlement extended over several acres, somewhat larger than the
area that was uncovered by the tide.
   The settlement was four miles from the ocean because the sea
level was significantly lower, and the eroded dunes show that the
landscape then formed a valley that would have sheltered the
encampment from the elements.
   The archaeologists conjecture that the group went from the
settlement to the sea to gather shellfish, but either ate it there
or shucked it and returned with just the meat. No seashells or
shell fragments have been found at the site.
   Archaeologist Gerald Kelso noted the settlement is a reminder
that other people were in the area centuries before the Pilgrims
arrived from Europe.
   ``Our history was written by Europeans, so you have this story
of the hardy pioneers settling virgin territory,'' he said. ``It
wasn't, and it hadn't been for 10,000 years before they got here.''
   It is not the first time archaeologists have had to race to save
important sites from Cape Cod's prehistory.
   A 7,000-year-old site in Mashpee was bulldozed to make way for a
golf course in 1987. When artifacts were found by a homeowner
digging a septic tank in 1982, scientists were given just three
days to excavate there. Spear points, arrowheads and flakes from
toolmaking were uncovered while developers were bulldozing land for
a subdivision in 1988.
   Most of the prehistoric settlements that have been found had
been disturbed by plows in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The
excavation on the beach was not because the sandy conditions above
it made farming difficult.

<TEXT>
   Boxes containing millions of sterile
screwworm flies will be dropped in northwestern Libya as part of an
international effort to eradicate the deadly insects and save
northern Africa's livestock.
   The project is a rare collaboration between the United States,
which developed the technology to stop the pests, and the Libyan
government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   Officials have sent leaflets and produced television spots for
the sheep-herding families in the region, telling them to open the
shoebox-sized containers to release the sterile flies and save
their flocks.
   In the test phase beginning this month, boxes containing the 3.5
million sterile screwworm flies are to be dropped once a week for
eight weeks from Libyan aircraft contracted by the United Nations.
   The $100 million effort aims to eradicate the screwworm flies
from more than 8,000 square miles of northwestern Libya. The idea
is for the sterilized insects to mate with the screwworm flies
already in the area. Sterile matings produce no offspring.
   After a review, a broader effort is scheduled to start in
February. Then, 100 million sterile flies will be dropped every
week.
   The boxes are designed to open on impact with the air, releasing
the sterile, harmless flies. But some may land unopened, and that's
where the information campaign comes in.
   ``We need to inform the people,'' said Furat Dridy, the
campaign's Tunisian director. ``They have to accept that the boxes
are safe. We ask the farmers and the children to open any closed
boxes, not to be afraid of them.''
   Television spots and leaflets carrying messages in simple words
and sketches advise people what to do during and after aerial
releases.
   In its first appearance outside the Americas, the screwworm was
discovered in Libya two years ago, probably imported in meat or
live animals from Latin America.
   The flesh-eating pest develops after a screwworm fly lays its
eggs in a wound as small as a tick bite on any warm-blooded animal,
including humans. The larvae burrow in, and as the wound enlarges
the smell attracts other females. The animal can die within days.
   The eradication technique seeks to introduce into an area 10
sterile males for every local female, said Hilmi Toros, spokesman
for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. The FAO is
organizing the project along with the U.N. Development Program and
other agencies.
   Because the female screwworm fly mates only once in a lifetime
of three to six weeks, matings with sterile males eventually
eliminate the potentially disastrous infestation.
   The program has been held up because of bureaucracy, a slow
response from nations to provide money, and an initial refusal by
the United States to deal with Libya. Toros said $30 million has
been pledged of the program's $100 million cost.
   Despite the program's four-month delay, project director Dan
Lindquist said the infested area has been restricted to
northwestern Libya.
   Many of the shepherds targeted in the propaganda campaign are
illiterate. But together with Libyan veterinarians they've helped
contain the screwworm's spread by regularly checking their animals
and quickly treating wounds.
   The infested zone starts about 25 miles east of the Tunisian
border and runs past Tripoli along the Mediterranean coast for 190
miles. The zone reaches 30 to 60 miles inland.

<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp predicted Sunday
the Bush administration will find a way to preserve minority-only
scholarships that are linked to students' financial needs.
   The White House and Justice Departments are reviewing a
controversial opinion from the Education Department's top civil
rights official that cast doubt on the legality of race-based
scholarships.
   Kemp, speaking on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,'' said, ``Like
most Americans, I don't believe in race-based or religious-based
quotas.''
   But he added, ``I do believe in affirmative efforts by colleges
to open up opportunity to minorities and low-income people.''
   ``It would be a mistake for the federal government to shut off
federal aid to a college ... because it's trying to promote
opportunities for minorities based on need and minority status,''
he said.
   The dispute, which has upset many college administrators and
civil rights groups, was triggered by an opinion circulated by
Michael Williams, the assistant education secretary for civil
rights, that federal law bars college scholarships predicated only
on race. He warned colleges could lose their eligibility for
federal aid if they gave such scholarships.
   But Kemp said Williams' interpretation of the law did not rule
out scholarships based on race as well as financial need.
   ``I think that is what ultimately is going to be the case,''
said Kemp.
   President Bush said Friday that he had asked his staff for ``a
quick readout on that so we can make a determination.''
   Top White House officials, including Chief of Staff John H.
Sununu, say they were caught by surprise by Williams' stance, which
became public after he sent a letter to organizers of the football
Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., cautioning them about plans to provide
$200,000 for minority scholarships at the University of Louisville
and University of Alabama.
   Williams said the Fiesta Bowl itself could award the
scholarships, but the two schools could not do it themselves.
   Williams said last week he had talked with lower level White
House officials beforehand.
   A source said Williams even held up his letter to the Fiesta
Bowl organizers for a week before sending it out without approval
from anyone in the White House.
   Bush, a longtime backer of the United Negro College Fund,
angered civil rights leaders by vetoing a job discrimination bill a
few weeks before the November elections. Bush said the bill would
have forced employers to resort to hiring quotas, which he opposes.

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Sees Economic `Slowdown' Lasting Until Spring</HEAD>

   The nation's economy is undergoing a
``significant slowdown'' that is likely to persist through early
1991 before turning around later next year, Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady said Sunday.
   ``I have been a little slow to declare national recession day,''
Brady said.
   Many private economists, however, have pronounced the economy in
recession, with layoffs rising and banks in trouble, and with the
retail sales, housing and car markets down. A recession is defined
as a contraction of six months or more in the gross national
product.
   ``I think it is quite clear that economic activity in the fourth
quarter of this year has slowed down,'' Brady said on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press'' program. ``How much we don't know yet, but it's
a significant slowdown.''
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House committee
last month said that oil-price problems resulting from the military
standoff in the Persian Gulf had helped push the economy into a
``meaningful downturn.''
   Brady, asked why he was reluctant to use the word recession,
said Sunday he did not have all the figures for th quarter.
   ``Let's watch and see,'' Brady said. ``Maybe it will be. I don't
think it's the end of the world even it we have a recession. We'll
pull back out of it again. No big deal.''
   While optimistic about the U.S. economy in the long-term, Brady
said there was ``no point being unrealistic'' about the sluggish
economy. ``I expect that that will continue into the first quarter
of this year.''
   ``We expect that during 1991 that it (the economy) will turn
around and we'll be back on the growth path, jobs, investment,
during that year,'' he added.
   Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers, also was confident about the future.
   ``Right now the best guess is the economy will be reviving
sometime next year, whether we will have a recession that lasts
several quarters - it should be mild and brief - or we narrowly
skirt it,'' he said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Bush administration officials blamed the Persian Gulf crisis for
aggravating the downturn by jacking up oil prices and sapping
consumer confidence.
   ``I am obviously concerned about events in the Persian Gulf,''
Boskin said. ``I think they have heavily influenced the short-term
impact on the economy.''
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, oil prices rose sharply
because of the cut in supplies caused by economic sanctions against
Iraq.
   ``The economy is already feeling the effects of the situation in
the gulf,'' Brady said. ``I myself, every American says, `Well, I'm
just going to wait and see a little bit.' If I was going to buy a
new car, I'll slow down on it.''
   Moreover, Boskin said the government might have to borrow money
to pay for Operation Desert Shield.
   Congressional Democrats say the cost of keeping as many as
400,000 U.S. troops in the gulf could add up to $36.8 billion in
fiscal year 1991. The Bush administration intends to ask Congress
for $20 billion early next year, House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., said Saturday.
   President Bush, meantime, is looking at a range of options to
stimulate the economy, including ways to lower the cost of capital
and generate jobs, Boskin said.
   Brady and Boskin said they both favored having the Federal
Reserve drop interest rates to boost the economy. ``I think there
is ample room for a further reduction in interest rates,'' Brady
said.
   Brady drew a distinction between the crisis in the banking
industry and the situation with failed savings and loan
institutions, which is expected to cost taxpayers up to $100
billion this year.
   ``Banks are not as healthy as we would like them,'' he said.
``The banks have $200 billion worth of capital, with another $60
billion in reserves,'' he said. ``When the S&amp;L industry got into
trouble, it had $10 billion.''
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., said on the NBC program that bank losses are expected to
total $4 billion this year and possibly $5 billion next year.
   The FDIC is working on a plan to have bankers pay to
recapitalize the government insurance fund, he said.
   Meantime, a House Banking subcommittee is due to release a
report Monday saying that if the country experiences a severe
recession, bank losses could total $63 billion. And even a mild
downturn in the economy could leave the FDIC fund short of cash.

   Two leading education research centers announced
Sunday they have received grants to devise better ways to measure
the thinking skills students will need to become successful adults.
   The University of Pittsburgh's Learning Research and Development
Center will receive $1.15 million from the Pew Charitable Trusts of
Philadelphia.
   For a related study, the National Center on Education and the
Economy in Rochester, N.Y., will get $1.3 million from the John D.
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago.
   The Pittsburgh group will deal primarily with technical aspects
of the study, while the Rochester center will focus on broader
policy questions, Betsy Brown Ruzzi, senior associate of the
Rochester group's Washington office, said in a telephone interview.
   The grants will fund the first 18 months of what could become a
decade-long effort to replace the common multiple choice tests with
a new testing method that measures how well students perform in
real-life situations, officials of both centers said.
   Growing numbers of educators and business leaders have
complained that standardized tests give misleadingly positive
signals about how well-prepared U.S. youngsters are for the complex
problems they will face as workers and citizens.
   Paul H. O'Neill, chief executive officer of ALCOA and chairman
of the President's Education Policy Advisory Committee, called the
grants ``very good news.''
   ``Improved assessment will help us to understand local, national
and internationl comparisons and point the way to necessary
changes in our education process,'' he said.
   The first glimpse of the proposed assessments appeared in the
Rochester center's landmark report last June, ``America's Choice:
High Skills or Low Wages,'' which decried U.S. students' lack of
preparation for the level of thinking and organization needed to
thrive in the workplace.
   According to the two research centers, the proposed new testing
methods would likely include:
   - ``performance examinations,'' in which students would
demonstrate their mastery of specific skills to panels of examiners
- much as an Olympic figure skater tries to impress a panel of
judges, said Ruzzi.
   - ``projects'' in which students show their ability to use
problem-solving skills over time, often in cooperation with other
students.
   - ``portfolios,'' consisting of the best work done by students
in a variety of areas over time.
   ``The goal of the new assessment system is not simply to create
better exams. The nation would be ill-served if high standards were
put in place, but few students were able or motivated to reach
them,'' said Marc Tucker, president of the Rochester-based center.
   Politicians and educators have been grappling for the past year
to devise better ways to measure their progress toward an ambitious
set of goals to improve education that was agreed upon last
February by President Bush and the nation's 50 governors.
   A 14-member National Education Goals Panel led by Colorado Gov.
Roy Romer is scheduled to hold its latest meeting in Washington on
Wednesday.
   Romer, in a statement accompanying Sunday's announcement,
applauded the Pittsburgh-Rochester project as ``a critical and
much-needed contribution to ongoing efforts to restructure
schools.''
   The two research centers said they planned over the next three
months to assemble a group of school districts and states that
would help develop and test the assessment project.
   The project's leaders said they hope that initial group will
also form the foundation of a national system that could
demonstrate whether the new brand of assessment is better than
multiple-choice testing.

   Police fired on mobs of Hindus and
Moslems to try to stop rioting not far from the Taj Mahal, and news
reports said six people were killed and 12 wounded.
   The Press Trust of India reported that two bodies, believed to
be of victims of Hindu-Moslem violence, also were recovered Sunday
in Agra, the site of the famed monument. The riots occurred within
three miles of the Taj Mahal, one of India's leading tourist
attractions.
   Two people also were killed Sunday in sectarian violence in
Jaipur, the capital of the desert state of Rajasthan, news reports
said.
   Hindu-Moslem clashes have left at least 296 people dead across
central and western India in the past 10 days. They started when
Hindu fundamentalists revived a campaign to build a temple on the
site now occupied by a mosque in the Hindu holy town of Ayodhya.
   In Agra, PTI reported at least 20 cases of rioting, arson and
looting. Police repeatedly urged the rioting mobs to stop before
firing, the news agency said.
   Sectarian violence has flared intermittently since India
achieved independence from Britain in 1947. Moslems account for 12
percent of India's 880 million people and Hindus comprise 82
percent.

   The oldest operating spacecraft

   Pioneer 6, a 140-pound cylindrical probe about a yard long and a

ago. But retired managers of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration Pioneer program won't celebrate the anniversary
until Monday when they plan to tune the probe's signal from the
Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
   The probe was designed to relay to Earth the first detailed
measurements from the other side of the sun of magnetic fields,
cosmic rays and solar wind particles.
   The journey was expected to last six months. But the signal has
never stopped, despite the failure of three of six instruments and
the flagging efficiency of the solar cells.
   Engineers at NASA and TRW Inc. of Redondo Beach, which built the
probe, estimate that the probe has traveled 15.4 billion miles
during 29 orbits around the sun.

<TEXT>
   Britain's ambassador to Kuwait and the
British consul arrived in Baghdad on Sunday, the last two Western
diplomats to leave the Iraqi-occupied emirate, British diplomats
said.
   Ambassador Michael Weston and Consul Larry Banks left the
embassy ``open but unmanned, and the Union Jack was still flying on
the premises,'' one diplomat said.
   They flew to Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, on a regularly
scheduled Iraqi Airways flight.
   The British government had said it would remove the remaining
staff members once all Britons who wanted to leave the country were
gone.
   About 500 Britons were evacuated in a major airlift last week
following Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's decision to allow all
foreigners to leave Iraq and Kuwait. About 40 Britons, mostly women
married to Kuwaitis, stayed behind.
   After its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq ordered foreign
embassies to close by Aug. 24. About two dozen mostly Western
embassies defied the orders but closed one by one in face of an
Iraqi seige that cut utilities and most of the food supplies.
   The United States and Britain continued to keep their embassies
open. American Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and the other four U.S.
diplomats in Kuwait left last week, saying all Americans who wished
to leave had done so.
   Weston and Banks were expected to leave for London on Monday via
Amman, Jordan, on a scheduled Iraqi Airways flight, according to
Britain's embassy in Baghdad.

   Government and business
leaders praised the European Community's decision to ease sanctions
on South Africa, but black opposition groups on Sunday criticized
the move.
   The EC said on Saturday it was lifting a voluntary ban on new
investment in South Africa. It left intact embargoes on the imports
of iron, steel and gold coins, and on arms exports.
   It was the first major sanction to be lifted against South
Africa since Western countries began imposing punitive measures in
the mid-1980s.
   Thabo Mbeki, head of the African National Congress' foreign
affairs department, said Sunday his movement ``is not going to
stand still on this matter.''
   Mbeki said the ANC would be in contact with the United States
and others in a bid to keep present sanctions in place.
   The EC, in an announcement Saturday at its summit in Rome, said
it would further ease sanctions when South Africa eliminates
remaining apartheid laws that segregate citizens by race and keep
the white minority in power.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha hailed the EC's move, calling
it ``positive recognition for President F.W. de Klerk's courageous
steps.''
   ``This also means that the state president's initiatives have
started a dramatic reversal in South Africa's foreign relations,''
he said Saturday. ``This will be to the advantage of all the people
of South Africa.''
   Anglo American, South Africa's largest corporation that
dominates the gold-mining industry, said in a statement Saturday it
expected the United States to take similar action next year.
   The company called the EC move a major step toward normalizing
relations between South Africa and the international community.
   The European decision came as the African National Congress, the
largest black opposition group, voted at a conference Saturday to
maintain its support for sanctions as a means of pressure on the
government to eliminate apartheid.
   Other opposition groups also expressed bitterness.
   ``The EC decision was to be expected because white people
support other white people,'' Itumeleng Mosala of the radical
Azanian People's Organization said Saturday. ``This will be a
lesson to black liberationmovements to know that in the struggle,
they are on their own.''
   In lifting the ban on new investment, the EC followed the lead
of Britain, which announced earlier this year it would unilaterally
end a ban on new investment to indicate support for de Klerk's
reforms.
   Since Britain's move, there has been no announcement of major
British investment in South Africa.
   There was no way to effectively gauge the immediate impact of
the EC action. Symbolically, though, it showed growing
international acceptance that the demise of apartheid was
inevitable and raised the prospect of other sanctions being lifted.
   South Africa's economy, potentially the strongest in southern
Africa, has been in recession for a year, due in part to the
isolation caused by sanctions.
   For example, more than half the 300 U.S. companies doing
business in South Africa have pulled out since sanctions took
effect in 1986. Many sold out to local managers but continue to
hold licensing agreements in South Africa.
   If the United States also lifts a ban on new investment, such
companies could buy back their facilities and resume production.
   But foreign investors have adopted a cautious attitude toward
South Africa because of chronic violence among black factions, the
changing political climate and the recession.

   A strong aftershock jolted eastern
Sicily on Sunday, sending thousands of people rushing into the
streets three days after a more powerful earthquake killed 17
people.
   The earthquake that rocked the island Thursday partially
destroyed the town of Carlentini.
   Sunday's quake measured 3.9 on the Richter scale, according to
the Ettore Majorana scientific center in the town of Erice. A
temblor of 3.5 can cause slight damage, while one of 4 can provoke
moderate damage.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   The epicenter Sunday was about 30 miles southeast of Sicily in
the Gulf of Noto. It was followed by a series of more minor shocks.
   In Carlentini, chunks of plaster toppled from buildings as the
aftershock hit.
   Many inhabitants in the town of 10,000 ran into the main square.
   Residents of Syracuse also rushed into piazzas and open areas.
   In a jail in the city, inmates launched a protest, demanding to
be transferred to a more secure location. Police surrounded the
building and fired in the air to quiet the prisoners.

   Residents of this city share with

memories of devastating floods and the kindness of faraway
strangers.
   Mount Vernon, Ohio, Mayor Ernie Farmer said his city's residents
sent more than $5,000 to the Washington city of the same name this
week to aid the victims of November's floods. The flooding in Mount
Vernon, Wash., left more than 150 people homeless and caused nearly
$20 million damage.
   When flooding struck the Ohio community in 1959, residents of
Mount Vernon, Wash., sent $1,000 and a planeload of food and
clothing. Farmer said his community's 1,300 residents never forgot
the favor.
   ``Good deeds last forever,'' he said.
   Mayor Ray Reep of the Mount Vernon, Washington, which has about
18,000 residents, said the money was welcome.
   ``It shows there's still a true spirit in this country,'' Reep
said. ``I wish we'd see it more often.''
   Both mayors said the two communities share a bond, even though
their only contact was 31 years ago.
   ``It's kind of like we adopted each other,'' Reep said.

   The publisher of the strikebound Daily News
Sunday called for the appointment of a federal mediator to force
both sides toward a settlement.
   ``What we are in favor of is a very high-powered, supermediator
... to come in and knock everybody's heads together,'' Publisher
James Hoge said on a local television news program.
   On the same show, Newspaper Guild President Barry Lipton said:
``We're willing to consider anything that will bring about a fair
and equitable settlement.''
   Hoge and Lipton both rejected binding arbitration.
   Both sides met separately in Washington last week with the head
of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Bernard DeLury.
No progress was made because the nine striking unions want to
bargain as a group and the company wants to bargain with them
individually.
   Both sides agreed to be recalled, but DeLury said he would wait
a few days before recalling them.
   The News has published every day since the strike began Oct. 25,
but it has lost advertisers and about half of its circulation,
which was 1.09 million before the strike.

   Bangladesh's caretaker government
marked the anniversary of independence from Pakistan by freeing 167
prisoners Sunday, the second group released since Hussain Muhammad
Ershad was ousted as president.
   Ershad was ousted earlier this month and then arrested last
week. No charges have yet been filed, but he is likely to be tried
for corruption.
   The Home Ministry said 124 people awaiting trial and 43 who were
convicted of criminal offenses were freed on Sunday. It did not
identify them.
   Prisoner releases on holidays are common in Bangladesh.
   Dec. 16 marks the day in 1971 that Bangladesh broke away from
Pakistan with the backing of Indian troops. Formal independence is
celebrated in March.
   Political prisoners detained by Ershad's government were
released after he was forced from office on Dec. 6.
   Ershad, a 60-year-old former army general, stepped down after
seven weeks of often violent protests and strikes. He handed over
power to Shahabuddin Ahmed, the Supreme Court chief justice.
   Elections are scheduled for March 2 to set up a democratic
government after 19 years of political turbulence marked by coups
and assasinations.
   Of the nine heads of state that Bangladesh has had so far, two -
including the first president - have been assassinated in military
coups.
   Ershad, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982, had nine
months left in his five-year term when he was forced out.
   In 1986, he was elected president in balloting that foreign
observers and the opposition said was rigged. He conducted two
parliamentary elections, but allegations of fraud were made in
both.
   The last election, in 1988, was boycotted by the two major
opposition parties.

   Hundreds of thousands of Moldavians on Sunday
demanded independence from the Kremlin, demonstrating on the eve of
a parliament session to consider President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
new Union Treaty.
   Gorbachev will preside over the opening of the fourth session of
the 2,250-member Congress of Peoples' Deputies, which also will
consider a proposal to strengthen Gorbachev's control over the
fragmenting union.
   Demonstrators on Sunday packed the center of Kishinev, capital
of the southwestern republic of Moldavia, in a self-declared
``Grand National Assembly.'' They demanded the Kremlin acknowledge
Moldavian sovereignty and called for changing Moldavia's name to
the ``Republic of Moldavia,'' dropping the words ``Soviet
socialist.''
   Marchers carried banners that said ``Down With The Russian
Empire,'' and ``Long Live Greater Romania.''
   Moldavia, formerly called Bessarabia by Romanians, has strong
ethnic ties to that neighboring country. More than 65 percent of
Moldavia's 4.3 million people speak a language identical to
Romanian, except that it uses Cyrillic characters.
   Romanian President Ion Iliescu has called for a unification of
Romania and Bessarabia into a ``Greater Romania.''
   Soviet television showed hundreds of thousands of people crowded
into a central square for the rally organized by the nationalist
Moldavian Popular Front. Some reports put the crowd size at
800,000, but the figure could not be verified.
   The republic, like nearly all the other 15 republics, has
declared autonomy over central Kremlin control. Several smaller
ethnic groups and regions within republics have sided with the
Kremlin, most fearing discrimination by the republics' majority
nationalities.
   In Estonia, about 3,000 demonstrators, mostly ethnic Russians,
rallied Sunday in support of Gorbachev and against the
independence-minded Estonian leadership, according to the
independent Estonian News Agency.
   The 21-month-old national parliament is expected to approve a
draft of the Union Treaty, the new charter proposed by Gorbachev to
redefine the relationship between the central government and the
republics.
   Under the proposed treaty, the national government would retain
control over defense and national security, as well as energy,
transportation and other key industries. Republics would gain some
control over economic decisions and their participation
theoretically would be voluntary.
   Gorbachev has said quick adoption of the treaty is necessary for
staving off further deterioration of the national economy.
   The Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, plus
Moldavia, have refused to join the talks.
   The Congress also is expected to approve the streamlining of the
executive branch of government that Gorbachev proposed last month
to break the paralysis of power that is hampering his reforms.
Under his plan, the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet, headed by
Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov would be replaced by several bodies
under direct presidential control.
   The Congress session likely will include tumultuous debate,
heightened by a newly assertive hard-line wing and a larger but
more disorganized liberal side.
   The liberal Inter-regional Group of Deputies has been unable to
agree on a stance toward the Union Treaty, while reformist Moscow
Mayor Gavriil Popov urged in a newspaper interview Sunday that the
Congress be dissolved and replaced by a new parliament that would
elect a new president.
   In recent weeks, Gorbachev has appeared to be trying to appease
the hard-liners. He has replaced the moderate interior minister
with a KGB general expected to crack down on political uprisings.
He has also ordered harsher KGB and army action.
   KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov last week pledged a crackdown on
radicals who he said were trying to gain power by sabotaging food
supplies during the nation's economic crisis.
   Gorbachev also has ordered the KGB, the army and Interior
Ministry to stop workers in the state distribution system from
stealing food and selling it on the black market. Such pilfering is
one key factor contributing to the nation's food crisis, which has
seen supplies of goods dwindle at state stores.

   Leftist guerrillas have launched a
series of attacks nationwide in retaliation for the army's raid on
their headquarters, officials said Sunday. At least eight people
have been reported killed.
   Troops overcame the last pocket of resistance at the guerrillas'
headquarters in a battle Saturday, according to an official
statement published in local newspapers. The mountaintop stronghold
is 90 miles south of Bogota, the Colombian capital.
   An official statement said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia responded by carrying out a dynamite attack in the city of
Medellin late Saturday. The explosion, targeting a police patrol,
killed a civilian and wounded a police officer, according to the
official statement.
   Officials suspect the guerrilla movement was also behind a
similar attack in Medellin on Dec. 10 in which seven police
officers were killed.
   Earlier Saturday, 10 rebels burned a small commercial aircraft
after attacking the airport of Villa Garzon, a town about 300 miles
south of Bogota. The guerrillas forced the 19 people aboard to
evacuate the plane before setting it on fire, according to a
statement by Aires Airlines, the aircraft's Colombian owner.
   In addition, army and police statements accused the guerrilla
movement and an allied rebel group of dynamiting an electrical
tower in northern Colombia on Saturday, attacking a military base
in the north on Friday, and burning a helicopter during an attack
Wednesday on an oil well in southern Colombia.
   No victims were reported in those attacks.
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, with an estimated
5,000 combatants, is the oldest and largest of Colombia's leftist
guerrilla groups.
   Fighting between government troops and the guerrilla movement
has left more than 50 people dead since Dec. 9, when the army began
its assault on the rebel headquarters.
   In other violence, seven people were killed Saturday in a
massacre near the town of Bolivar, 150 miles south of Bogota.
Police say they have not been able to identify the killers, who
fled the scene.

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo left the Soviet
Union Sunday after ending a 30-year diplomatic chill and opening
new communications in efforts to settle hostilities on the Korean
Peninsula, Tass reported.
   ``I and President Mikhail Gorbachev have announced to the entire
world that we will pay maximum effort to establish peace on the
Korean Peninsula and the Asian-Pacific region,'' Roh said at a
luncheon in Leningrad before departing for home.
   Roh, the first leader in the history of his country to visit the
Soviet Union, met in the Kremlin on Friday with President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and the two leaders signed a declaration of ``trust
and cooperation.''
   The summit capped a reversal of Cold War relations. They reached
a low point in 1983 when a Soviet jet shot down Korean Air Lines
Flight 007 after it had strayed into Soviet air space. All 269
people aboard the civilian jetliner were killed.
   Roh said Friday that the new relationship with the Soviet Union
and the end of the Cold War in the Pacific region could give
impetus to the drive to reunite his Western-allied country with
Communist North Korea.
   Roh said Gorbachev urged him to have patience on the question of
reunification and ``develop an atmosphere of mutual trust, and in
that climate, it will be more propitious for specific ways for the
unification of Korea.''
   During the talks, the two sides also signed agreements on trade
and scientific and technological cooperation, Roh said.
   The two countries formally re-established diplomatic relations
Sept. 30.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Romanians rallied Sunday
in Timisoara, where the country's popular revolution was born, in
an emotional first anniversary celebration of the death of
Communism.
   They also demanded the resignation of the current government,
which was democratically elected but is dominated by former
Communists.
   About 15,000 people gathered as snow fell in Opera Square, the
site of last year's violent protests that led to the ouster and
execution of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``Twelve months of lies!'' the demonstrators chanted, some
waving Romanian tri-color flags with holes cut in the middle to
resemble those of the revolution with the Communist emblem excised.
   In the capital, Bucharest, several hundred anti-government
demonstrators occupied central University Square in the early
evening. They shouted demands for the resignation of Iliescu and
the government and blocked traffic before being dispersed by about
300 club-wielding police. No arrests or injuries were reported.
   In a national television address Sunday night, President Ion
Iliescu appealed for calm and tried to quell opposition fears.
   ``To negate the results of the elections only six months after
they were held and impose something else in the name of a
dissatisfied minority... would only amplify our difficulties,'' he
said.
   The post-Ceausescu provisional government led by Iliescu's
National Salvation Front capitalized on the elation following the
revolution to overwhelmingly win democratic elections May 20.
   Since then, however, economic hardship and the growing suspicion
that senior Front officials who previously served Ceausescu have
not broken with Communism has turned many people against the Front.
   Unrest has grown over the last month in Timisoara, Bucharest and
elsewhere. Demonstrators have demanded the resignation of Iliescu,
Premier Petre Roman and other senior officials. Those demands were
voiced again Sunday.
   But the rallies in both Timisoara and Bucharest were smaller
than expected, perhaps because of recent government pledges to
postpone price hikes on food and other goods from January to June.
   In Timisoara, opposition politicians, student activists and
labor leaders speaking from the balcony of the city opera house all
said the government had betrayed the revolution.
   ``Down with Iliescu; down with the Communist government!'' they
chanted. ``Iliescu at Christmas, you're the best pig to
slaughter!''
   ``Down with the Securitate!'' the crowd roared, alluding to
widespread perceptions that the government continues to tolerate
Ceausescu's feared secret police. ``Hands soaked in blood!''
   Passers-by applauded. Several old men and women, dressed in
black and clutching pictures of sons and daughters killed by army
and Securitate bullets last year, wept and crossed themselves as
the marchers knelt and intoned prayers.
   ``The last chance - another revolution!'' the crowd chanted.
   Earlier this month, the government postponed price increases for
basic foodstuffs and services from January to June. The move
appeared to take some of the fight out of Bucharest workers and
students, who backed away from planned strikes aimed at bringing
down the leadership.
   But in Timisoara, a city of 283,000 about 300 miles northwest of
the capital, anti-government activism continued.
   Eleven local factories employing about 50,000 people have been
on strike since Dec. 9. Student representatives said about 22,000
university students had been boycotting classes since Dec. 9 and
would continue the boycott after the end of Christmas break, Jan.
6, unless national leaders resign.
   About 100,000 students and hundreds of professors are striking
nationwide.
   Timisoara's central role in the revolution accounts for some of
its radicalism.
   The uprising began last Dec. 16 outside the local yellow-brick
church of Laszlo Toekes, the ethnic Hungarian pastor whose fervent
criticism of Ceausescu prompted an order by the dictator to
forcibly resettle him.
   Police broke into the church, beat Toekes and took him away.
Parishioners and others who had gathered outside marched to the
Communist Party headquarters, where they broke windows and set
fires.
   Demonstrations spread across Romania and there were vicious
street battles between citizens and the heavily armed secret
police. The army sided with the citizens, however, and Ceausescu
fled Bucharest on Dec. 22. He was captured a day later and executed
on Christmas Day.
   Toekes now is a bishop of his Reformed Church of Protestants and
lives in Oradea, 40 miles northeast of Timisoara. He returned to
his former church Sunday to hold a commemorative service.

<HEAD>Many Foreign Airlines Unsafe, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A double standard, encouraged by international
agreements, exists for foreign airlines operating in the United
States, endangering passengers, crews and people on the ground, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration never verifies the
qualifications of pilots for foreign airlines and fails to inspect
foreign-owned airline equipment unless the other government
requests it, according to New York Newsday.
   In its five-month investigation, Newsday ran a computer analysis
of some 700 accidents worldwide; conducted scores of interviews;
and reviewed thousands of documents, some obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act.
   Newsday said pilots for some foreign carriers don't get training
in such basic elements as supervising crews and using devices that
warn of collision with high terrain.
   In the last 20 years, almost 21,000 people have been killed on
foreign airlines. Those carriers make about half of all flights but
account for 80 percent of the deaths worldwide, Newsday said.
   This year, the gap was even wider: Almost 500 people died on
foreign planes while only 37 were killed on U.S. carriers.
   The statistics exclude accidents caused by sabotage or
terrorism.
   FAA spokesman Fred Ferrar in Washington said Sunday he hadn't
seen the story and didn't want to comment.
   Bill Spohrer, who runs Challenge Air Cargo in Miami, told how
regulators from Central American countries inspected the airlines
he used to run in Nicaragua and Honduras:
   ``The inspector would come up and we'd put him up at the hotel.
He'd bring his wife or girlfriend, and they'd go shopping. On the
last day before he had to leave, he'd come by and say, `OK, what do
I have to sign?'''
   Richard Haberly, president of a small Miami-based cargo airline,
scuttled plans to lease a jet he needed when the FAA said it would
require $300,000 in modifications to meet U.S. safety standards.
   A month later, he saw it land in Miami under the colors of a
foreign carrier.
   ``It's just awful we allow them to come to the U.S. with barely
any regulation at all,'' said Robert Lochner, a former FAA
inspector who was supposed to oversee 60 foreign carriers by
himself.
   Newsday said most carriers from wealthier nations had
above-average safety records, but many from developing countries
and Eastern Europe were among the most dangerous.
   Although the FAA has authority to inspect foreign carriers,
under international practice, the United States usually just
accepts a foreign country's word about crew qualifications and
planes' worthiness.
   Anthony Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for
regulation in Washington, D.C., told Newsday that the FAA doesn't
examine foreign carriers closely because the current system works.
   ``Tragic accidents, despite the best efforts of the best
agencies in the world, sometimes happen,'' said Broderick. ``But
there are very few international accidents in the United States or
around the world. These international agreements have proven the
test of time and work well.''
   Newsday said the National Transportation Safety Board plans to
rule early next year on the probable cause of the Avianca crash
last January on Long Island that killed 73 people.
   The newspaper reported that the NTSB is expected to recommend
that the FAA beef up its rules for foreign carriers and crews
because of problems uncovered in that accident.

<HEAD>Israeli Defense Chief Promises More Deportations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GWEN ACKERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens on Sunday defended
the decision to deport four Moslem fundamentalists following the
stabbing deaths of three Israelis. He said the explusions ``will
not be the last.''
   The deportation order, criticized by the U.S. State Department
and some Israeli officials, was appealed by Arab lawyers Sunday as
authorities placed the occupied Gaza Strip under curfew and planned
to bar some Arabs from entering Jerusalem.
   Israel reinstituted its controversial deportation policy after a
16-month break. Recently, public anxiety about Arab attacks has
risen, and right-wing politicians have urged a harsh crackdown.
   Israel wants to show Arabs linked to murders that it ``will
cause immediate deportation of people he knows, whom he works with
and who incite him to violence,'' Arens said on army radio.
   ``I believe that the deportation ... will not be the last, and
we will not hesitate to use this tool in the future in the ame
instances where it will be effective,'' Arens said.
   Health Minister Ehud Olmert indicated Israel wants to expel more
Arabs but is sensitive to U.S. criticism.
   The Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said Arens wanted to deport 14
Palestinians, but that Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir approved only
four.
   The deportations were ordered Saturday, a day after three Jews
were stabbed to death in a factory in the Tel Aviv suburb of Jaffa.
Hamas, or Zeal, an underground Moslem fundamentalist group, claimed
responsibility.
   Hamas published a leaflet Sunday praising the killings and
calling for a week of escalated attacks on Israelis, Israel radio
and television reported.
   The four ordered deported were from the Gaza Strip and were
known Hamas activists who helped organize acts of violence. The
army said about 600 Arabs were arrested in a weekend sweep on Hamas
activists.
   However, Israeli authorities have not said if the people they
ordered out are suspected of involvement in the murders.
   Arab lawyers in Gaza appealed the deportation orders to a
military board Sunday. The appeal is expected to be considered
Monday, Israeli media said.
   Curfews confined about 320,000 Gaza residents to their homes,
and a naval blockade stopped fishermen from launching their boats
Sunday.
   In Tel Aviv, police reportedly rounded up some Palestinian
workers and bused them back to Gaza after detaining them overnight.
Police spokesman Ron Yishayahu said those without permits to stay
in Israel overnight were being sent home.
   Yishayahu did not say how many Palestinians were being taken
back to Gaza. About 110,000 Arabs from the occupied territories
work in Israel.
   Israel television said police also planned to bar Arabs from the
occupied West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem on Monday.
Authorities fear violence at the Temple Mount, where Jewish
extremists have threatened to demonstrate for the Hanukkah holiday.
At least 17 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police gunfire in
October during Arab riots at Temple Mount.
   There was new criticism Sunday of the deportation order.
   The U.S. State Department denounced it as a violation of human
rights protection provided by the Geneva Convention.
   ``We hope the Israeli government will come up with some other
way of dealing with the problem,'' U.S. Sen. Daniel K. Inouye,
D-Hawaii, told reporters in Jerusalem.
   Interior Minister Aryeh Deri of Israel was also critical.
   ``They should have been put on trial and then deported,'' Deri,
of the ultra-Orthodox Torah Guardians Party, told the national Itim
news agency.
   Shimon Peres, leader of the left-of-center Labor Party, said,
``I suggest we stop competing for who can climb higher on the
ladder of violence and see how we can lower the escalation rather
than raise it ... walls, sticks and deportations won't solve the
problem.''
   Sixty Arabs have been expelled since the Palestinian uprising
began in December 1987. The last to be deported were five
Palestinians in August 1989.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization on Sunday denounced the
deportation order as ``a violation of international law,''
according to a statement received in Nicosia, Cyprus.

   Winter weather moved into the Northeast on Sunday, dumping more
than a foot of snow in some parts of Vermont, and snow or rain
pelted much of the remainder of the nation while Colorado prepared
for more snow and avalanches.
   In Vermont, up to 14 inches of snow fell by early afternoon at
Waitsfield, 12 inches at St. Johnsbury and Middlebury, and 10
inches at Williamstown.
   Meanwhile, rain extended across southern Maine and New
Hampshire, and rain changed to snow across Vermont into northeast
New York state.
   Snow also reached across western New York state into the
mountains of north-central Pennsylvania and higher elevations of
south-central New York state.
   Other snowstruck areas: parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona,
Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.
   Colorado braced for a second blast of snow Sunday night as a
storm headed into the state. Snow and avalanche warnings were
issued.
   A storm that swept through southern Colorado dumped 4 inches at
Alamosa, and up to 8 inches of new snow in the mountains overnight
Saturday.
   More than 50 avalanches have been reported since Friday,
according to Colorado Avalanche Information Center officials. Some
were induced by professional snow workers, but many occurred
naturally.
   Rain extended across western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio and
northwestern West Virginia. Parts of Alabama, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri and
Kansas also got hit with some rain.
   Rain fell in western Washington state, with rain changing to
snow in the mountains.
   The nation's low Sunday morning was 19 degrees below zero at
Jackson, Wyo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Jackson to 83 at Fort Myers, Fla.

   Two anti-tank missiles crashed into the
European Community's offices in downtown Athens late Sunday,
causing damages and slightly injuring two passers-by, police said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. However, leftist
guerrillas claimed responsibility for a bombing at the EC bureau's
offices a year ago.
   Regional police chief Simeon Papadogiorgos said the explosion
was caused by two anti-tank missiles.
   A spokesman at police headquarters did not say whether there
were employees in the office at the time nor whether the usual
police guards were at the building's entrance.
   Two women at a nearby bus stop were slightly injured by flying
glass, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The EC offices were damaged in December 1989 by a bomb planted
by the Revolutionary Popular Struggle, a leftist group that has
staged a bombing campaign since the mid-1970s. No one was injured
in that attack.
   In addition, Greece's most notorious urban guerrilla group,
November 17, has used anti-tank missiles in the past in an attack
on a U.S.-based multinational corporation and on a Greek shipowner.
The leftist group has killed 14 people since 1975.
   November 17 is opposed to Greece's EC and NATO membership and to
the U.S. military presence in Greece.
   The group has killed 14 people since 1975, without any of its
members being arrested.
   Parliament is due to vote on a new anti-terrorism law Monday to
give police wider powers to investigate suspects and bar news media
from publicizing statements by terrorist groups.

   An Israeli army patrol clashed Sunday with
a Palestinian guerrilla squad in southern Lebanon. Police said
three guerrillas were killed and two Israeli soldiers wounded.
   The Israeli military confirmed that two soldiers were wounded,
but said one guerrilla was killed and one wounded.
   The early-morning shootout was near the village of Yater, 11
miles south of Tyre, Lebanon's southernmost port on the
Mediterranean, police reported. The village is on the edge of
Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' it uses as a buffer
against cross-border guerrilla forays.
   The Israeli military said infantry troops encountered the
guerrilla squad about two miles north of the Israeli border.
   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing
regulations, said the 10 guerrillas, members of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, were spotted by a 30-man
Israeli patrol.
   U.N. security sources said that after the firefight, three
Israeli Cobra helicopter gunships flew over the Mariamin Valley
near Yater, apparently in search for guerrilla survivors. But no
strafing was reported.
   Later, the Democratic Front issued a communique claiming
responsibility for the attack. The communique said machine guns and
rocket-propelled grenades were used in the fighting.
   The battle occurred 12 days after a clash in the same area in
which one Palestinian guerrilla was killed and two Israeli soldiers
were wounded. The Democratic Front said its fighters were also
involved in that clash.
   The group is a radical flank of Yasser Arafat's Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Yater is policed by a Nepalese battalion serving with the U.N.
peacekeeping force in South Lebanon.
   Israeli soldiers later attacked guerrilla targets north of the
security zone, destroying a launching pad for assaults on Israel,
the Israeli military command said. It added there were no Israeli
casualties and did not elaborate.
   Artillery fire was also aimed at a site in south-central
Lebanon, destroying rocket launchers aimed at Israel, the command
said. It provided no further details.
   The Israeli military command said the Yater clash was the 20th
this year between Israeli or Israeli-allied forces and guerrillas
in Lebanon. In these confrontations, seven soldiers and 43
guerrillas have been killed, the army said.
   The Israeli-held zone covers 440 square miles from the
Mediterranean coast to the foothills of Mount Hermon.

   It was an unusual Hanukkah
celebration: Jewish sailors on a U.S. aircraft carrier in the Red
Sea, lighting menorahs as they sail past Arab countries
traditionally hostile to Israel.
   For the dozen or so Jewish sailors aboard the USS John F.
Kennedy, Hanukkah, the festival of lights, has been a time to
reflect on their deployment in the Middle East.
   ``This is where the Jewish people became a people, and on
Hanukkah as we light the lights, we recall the suffering and joys
of our ancestors as a people,'' said Navy Lt. Robert S. Feinberg, a
rabbi from New York, as he led prayers for peace in the Persian
Gulf on Friday, the fourth night of Hanukkah.
   It has also been a time to cast aside worries about war and
briefly indulge in some of the joys of Hanukkah - plentiful potato
pancakes and games of dreidel, a four-sided spinning top with
Hebrew letters on each side.
   Petty Officer 1st Class Eric Friedman, 33, of Massapequa, N.Y.,
said he felt he was fighting for the same principle as the Jews did
in 167 B.C., when the Maccabees defeated the Syrians and the Temple
of Jerusalem was rededicated. Hanukkah commemorates that
rededication.
   ``We're here standing up for freedom against an oppressor,'' he
said. ``Of course, my parents would rather have me home, but
they're proud of me that I'm serving and standing up for freedom.''
   Lt. Toby Bacaner, 31, of Minneapolis, the air wing's flight
surgeon, said: ``When the United States goes somewhere, we bring
American values with us and we practice them here.''
   Petty Officer 3rd Class Michael Shasteen, 23, of Dallas, said
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has to be stopped.
   ``I know it sounds gung-ho. I'll die for my country. It doesn't
bother me. I'll die for something that's right, and I think this is
very right,'' he said.
   The U.S. military has refused to allow the media to attend any
religious services in Saudi Arabia, where all religions except
Islam are banned. Several reporters visiting the Kennedy were
allowed to attend Hanukkah services because the ship is in
international waters.
   The congregation on the Kennedy is led by Chief Petty Officer
Sidney Cohen, 41, of Virginia Beach, Va., a senior cook who not
only organizes weekly Sabbath services but has taught his staff to
make potato pancakes and challah, the traditional Jewish bread.
   Cohen received a commendation at a Hanukkah dinner Saturday from
Rear Adm. Riley D. Mixson, commander of Navy operations in the Red
Sea, for his service to the Jewish community.
   Chief Petty Officer Alfred Lasure, 42, of Vineland, N.J., who
works on the flight deck, said that historically the Jews and Arabs
are cousins, and if they retraced their roots perhaps they could
learn to coexist.
   For Chief Petty Officer Gary Love, 39, of Birmingham, Ala., the
air wing's damage control chief, coming to Hanukkah services was
``a way to be with your family when you're not with your family.''
   ``The other night all of us were down on the floor playing with
dreidels - a bunch of grown men on the mightiest warship in the
Navy playing dreidel,'' he said. The game is traditionally played
by children on Hanukkah.

   Anti-government feeling has reached unprecedented
levels in Communist Albania and if authorities aren't careful the
country could ``go the Romanian route,'' a U.S. scholar said Sunday
after spending two weeks there.
   Nicholas C. Pano, a history professor at Western Illinois
University and leading scholar of Albania, was one of only a
handful of foreigners who were traveling in the country as it was
shaken by violent rioting and political upheaval last week.
   He described broad changes sweeping Europe's last stronghold of
Stalinism - from the playing of Bob Dylan on state radio to the
formation of opposition political parties.
   But he also said that an economic crisis and disgust at official
corruption and the country's self-imposed isolation had driven
Albanians to the limit.
   ``I myself was surprised by the strength of feeling, the pent-up
anger and desire for change,'' Pano said Sunday, a day after flying
from Albania to Italy.
   ``A few wrong decisions (by the government) could see the whole
thing go the Romanian route.''
   Romania's Communist government was overthrown last year in a
revolution, and its dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, was executed.
   Pano, the author of a book on Albania, said numerous changes
reflect the government's cautious reforms and citizens' growing
boldness in demanding their rights.
   In the capital city of Tirana, for example, workers at Albania's
film studio are discussing forming a political party, he said.
Television workers are calling for freedom from state control.
   Typographers at government-controlled newspapers are talking
about establishing the first independent trade union, he said.
   State media were unusually frank in reporting on rioting in at
least four cities last week.
   Albanians are abuzz about the state radio's recent decision to
broadcast part of a Bob Dylan song, Pano said. He didn't know which
one.
   He quoted Albanians as saying that an orchestra in Tirana played
George Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in Blue'' a few weeks ago - a real
event in a country that long tried to ban most Western influences.
   The Albanian Communist leadership has this year embarked on a
program of cautious reform, including lifting restrictions of
religious practice. It had ruled out political pluralism, however,
until last week when President Ramiz Alia said the Communist
leadership would allow the formation of alternative parties.
   But Pano, who speaks Albanian, said students and blue-collar
workers voiced deep suspicions about authorities' promises of
reform.
   ``Any attempt now (by the government) to turn back would have
serious repercussions in the country,'' Pano said. ``The regime
could not survive.''
   The more radical demands of some students may force a split in
the country's first opposition party, the Democratic Party, he
said. Among the new party's leaders are middle-aged intellectuals,
such as Tirana University Professor Gramoz Pashko, who have been
treated well by the government.
   ``There are some people ... who express concern about what they
call `coddled intellectuals,''' said Pano.
   He attributed the government's ouster of five Politburo members
last week to widespread popular dissatisfaction over official
incompetence and high living.
   Albanians are becoming more vocal in objecting to such behavior,
he said.
   For example, in the southern town of Korce, more than 500 people
marched to the home of a Communist Party leader on Dec. 9. They
demanded to know why he had three cars when they had insufficient
bus service, Pano said, citing local witnesses.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Lech Walesa on Sunday
invoked the memory of shipyard workers killed 20 years ago as he
asked Poles to support his future government's policies, saying
they will complete the country's reforms.
   Walesa spoke before a Roman Catholic Mass under the towering
monument at the gates of the Gdansk Shipyard, one of the sites
along the Baltic coast where dozens of workers were killed in
anti-government riots Dec. 16-17 1970.
   He said his election as president one week ago would help
fulfill the slain shipyard workers' dream of a better Poland.
   ``A huge task awaits us. That is why at this monument to those
killed, in this sacred place, I call on all compatriots: Take
things in your hands. Don't wait,'' Walesa told 4,000 people
attending the nationally televised ceremony held in freezing, windy
weather.
   He promised as president to ``do everything so that you meet as
few obstacles as possible on the road of reforms.''
   The government he is forming ``will present a program of
changes, taking into account your criticisms pronounced during the
election campaign.''
   ``I don't claim that it will be an easy program. We will lift
our country up with the effort of the whole nation. We will fulfil
the last will of those killed,'' he pledged.
   In addition to Polish and Solidarity labor union flags flying at
the monument dedicated 10 years ago Sunday, there was a flag of the
European Community. Poland is applying for associate membership in
the EC and would like to be a full member by the year 2000.
   Of the workers killed 20 years ago in Gdansk, Gdynia and
Szczecin, Walesa said: ``They gave their lives for us. Solidarity
was born from their blood.''
   Walesa worked as an electrician at the Gdansk Shipyard for
nearly two decades. He was chosen by fellow laborers to help lead
the bloody 1970 strike to protest food price increases imposed just
before the Christmas holiday. It was Walesa's first experience in
worker activism.
   During the 1970s, Walesa faithfully marked the anniversary of
the deaths, risking arrest by police who tried to prevent the
observances.
   Recalling those years, Walesa said:
   ``Today, I am with you as the president-elect. I am able to
realize the last will of those who died.
   ``Free Poland is changing for the better - but too slowly.''
   Walesa is scheduled to be sworn in as Poland's first directly
elected president Saturday. He is expected almost immediately to
nominate a prime minister to replace Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, who was rejected by voters for president.
   On Saturday, Walesa's spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski said that
Walesa has authorized lawyer Jan Olszewski to hold talks on forming
the government. But he added that it does not necessarily mean
Olszewski will get the prime minister's post.

   The new spiritual leader of
Irish Roman Catholics on Sunday demanded the Irish Republican Army
end its two-decade campaign of terror.
   The Rev. Cahal Daly's harsh comments came at his installation as

Prime Minister Charles Haughey and Britain's Northern Ireland
secretary, Peter Brooke.
   ``The longer you continue with your campaign of violence, the
more ignominious in the end will be the memory you will leave
behind you, and the further away from attainment will be any of
your aims and objectives,'' he told the IRA.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule
in Northern Ireland.
   Daly, 73, who leads the 3.8 million Roman Catholics in Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic, said the IRA's goals could be
attained through peaceful political progress.
   ``You have no sane reason or justification - moral, rational or
political - for continuing with your campaign of violence,'' he
told the IRA.
   ``You have every reason - moral, rational and political - for
calling off your campaign now.''
   The IRA, which is waging a shooting and bombing campaign to
unite the largely Protestant province with the mainly Catholic
Republic of Ireland, is opposed by a number of Protestant
paramilitary groups, many of them illegal.
   Daly said there are people in both Catholic and Protestant
communities whose consciences are ``blindfolded'' and prevented
them seeing the enormity of their violent deeds.
   The popular overthrow of Communist governments in Eastern Europe
last year was primarily a spiritual and moral revolution, he said,
and it achieved by peaceful means what armed uprising never could.
   Daly, the Bishop of Down and Connor since 1982, succeeds
Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, who died in May of a heart attack, aged
66, while on pilgrimage to the shrine of Lourdes, France.
   His successor was installed at Armagh's St. Patrick's Cathedral,
and a number of leading Protestant churchmen was also in
attendance.
   Educated at Queen's University in Belfast and the Institut
Catholique in Paris, Daly was ordained in 1941.
   Daly has become known for his outspokenness against the IRA. In
October, at the funeral of a Catholic man mistaken by the IRA for a
Protestant, he called the IRA ``the greatest affliction of our
community over the past 20 years'' and said membership of the IRA
was ``most gravely sinful.''
   Around 2,800 people have died in 20 years of sectarian violence
in Northern Ireland.

<HEAD>Florist Death Spurs More Questions About Dallas Police and
Minorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fatal shooting of a black florist by a white
rookie policeman responding to a burglary call has prompted calls
for an investigation and revived talk about racial tensions
precipitated by Dallas police.
   Community leaders' urged a congressional or local independent
probe into Friday's slaying of R.L. ``Gunny'' Rose, owner of
Veteran's Florist on Dallas' south side.
   Police said 25-year-old Officer Vincent Reetz mistakenly
believed Rose was an assailant.
   Some say Rose's death is too reminiscent of two other Dallas
police killings that ignited racial strife and prompted calls for
massive department reforms.
   In the cases of Etta Collins in 1986 and David Horton in 1987,
each victim was black, carrying a gun in self-defense and killed by
a white officer.
   Black leader Roy Williams said the fatal shooting supports his
earlier request for an investigation of the Dallas Police
Department.
   ``This is not just an African-American or Latino problem,''
Williams told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram in Sunday's editions.
``This crosses all races and socioeconomic levels. ... The system
is broken and we must fix it. But we must act now.''
   And City Council member Al Lipscomb, who's black, said he wants
an investigation into Rose's shooting and the department's deadly
force policy.
   But police and their supporters say the shooting is just another
tragic mistake, unjustly tinged with racial undertones.
   ``This could have happened to anybody on the department,'' said
Sgt. Mike Black, who coordinates field training for rookies.
   Police officials said Reetz did not hear the 53-year-old man
identify himself as the flower shop's owner.
   ``It was dark out there, and there's a fine line between doing
the right thing and doing the wrong thing,'' Black said. ``It's all
reaction.
   ``It's not like on TV when the music is climaxing and then you
go to commercial. There, you have a couple of minutes to think
about the situation and come up with a solution. This is the real
world, and things don't happen that way.''
   Rose's store had been broken into twice in the last month. When
the alarm went off a third time, at 1:30 a.m. Friday, he arrived at
the store before police.
   He was shot in the chest when he turned, revolver in hand, when
he heard Reetz utter a command.
   ``Mr. Rose's reaction to the command from a police officer was
not unreasonable,'' said Deputy Chief Ray Hawkins. ``Unfortunately,
when you turn, you bring the weapon to bear. That's the concern we
have with people arming themselves.''
   Joan Smotzer, co-chairwoman of the Unified Coalition for Police
Reforms, noted that Rose had identified himself to Reetz's partner
moments before the shooting.
   If Reetz were unaware of the exchange, as he has told
authorities, then it points up the need for better training, Ms.
Smotzer said.
   The death of Mrs. Collins, 70, prompted a congressional hearing
in April 1987 that focused on the history of strained relations
between minorities and Dallas police.
   The next month, David Horton, 81, was shot to death while
investigating a car theft in the parking lot of his apartment
building.
   Police Chief Billy Prince, who blamed City Council critics for
creating ``a negative atmosphere'' that led to violence against
officers, resigned under pressure the following year.
   Mack Vines, billed as a reformer, took the helm in mid-1988 and
quickly promoted minority officers into top jobs.
   In 1989, the civilian review board was given limited powers to
investigate allegations of police wrongdoing.
   Vines himself was fired early this year for lying about a
shooting inquiry.

<HEAD>EPA Officials Perplexed by Disappearance of PCBs at Hazardous Waste
Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTVILLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmental Protection Agency officials
say they're stumped by the disappearance of PCBs from a hazardous
waste site that once had high concentrations of the cancer-causing
substance.
   Polychlorinated biphenyls, once used as insulators in electrical
transformers, were banned by the federal government in the 1970s.
They have not been known to break down in the environment and have
been considered nearly impossible to destroy.
   But officials say a lagoon at the former Cam-Or oil re-refinery
site - which once contained more than triple the concentration of
PCBs allowed by law - now appears free of the contaminants.
   EPA spokeswoman Sue Pastor said agency officials are studying
the site to find out what happened.
   The EPA cited Cam-Or in January 1985 for PCBs in three of 11
waste oil lagoons. The company filed for bankruptcy two years
later.
   Jack Barnette, an EPA supervisor for emergency response, helped
oversee a containment and temporary cleanup project in which crews
combined the three infested lagoons, drained and treated the
wastewater, and added lime to help harden the waste.
   The EPA then covered the new lagoon with a tarp to prevent rain
from washing contaminants out of it.
   When EPA officials returned to test the lagoon in mid-1988, they
found the oil sludge intact but the PCBs gone, Barnette said.
   Well water monitoring around the site shows the chemicals did
not seep out of the lagoon, he said. Officials say the PCBs appear
to have disintegrated into harmless chemical components.
   Barnette said the leading theory is that high heat and low
moisture during a long drought in 1988 combined to disintegrate the
contaminants.
   Lime used to harden the sludge may have also helped break down
the PCBs, but so far there is no scientific evidence to prove it,
Barnette said.
   At a similar site in Toledo, Ohio, where the EPA began a cleanup
effort just after the one at Cam-Or, lime was used to harden sludge
and the PCBs also disappeared.
   ``We are not sure if it was the environment or the lime or the
combination, but from now on we'll be using lime when we deal with
PCBs,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Frustration replaced fear among
many Haitians who overcame worries of election violence Sunday -
but confronted long voting delays.
   ``Nothing would keep me from voting,'' said 25-year-old Jean
Elie, standing in line at a school to vote in the effort to hold
Haiti's first fully democratic elections in history.
   Ballots and ballot boxes were late arriving at many polling
stations. At one, no ballots had arrived by noon, six hours after
the official start of voting. Some election delegates said they
also lacked pens, ink and registration lists.
   In general, Haitians shrugged off the possibility that a 1987
Election Day massacre would be repeated. That election was called
off after thugs with machetes, knives and guns killed at least 34
voters.
   Many voters rode bicycles or walked for miles, arriving before
dawn and waiting for the polls to open.
   In the Cite Soleil slum, where thousands live in ramshackle huts
and bathe in open sewers, voters grew impatient and began waving
their registration cards in the air after many polls failed to open
on time.
   ``Hurry up, please let us in,'' a chorus of people standing
outside a school pleaded with election officials.
   When some voters began waving branches, the traditional symbol
of celebration or protest, 50 riot police arrived to block any
attempt to start a demonstration.
   ``We have a lot of help, but not enough,'' said Daniel Bernier,
in charge of the elections in western Haiti. ``We don't have enough
cars (to deliver supplies).''
   His office was stacked with undelivered ballots and folded
ballot boxes. Outside, workers were rushing them onto a truck.
   Some who failed to register expressed regret.
   ``I saw what happened last time. I lost two cousins and my aunt
was wounded here. But now I feel sorry not to be voting,'' said
Fleury Margella, 25, who tried to vote in 1987 at the Argentine
Bellegrade secondary school, where 14 were slain in the election
massacre.
   At the school, only two of the 19 voting booths were open two
hours after polls opened Sunday.
   Some of the nearly 1,000 international observers noted Haitian's
interim government had been little time to prepare for elections,
announced in September.
   ``There are going to be glitches all over,'' said J. Michael
Levesque, mayor of West Warwick, R.I., who is one of eight
observers sent by President Bush. ``But when you see people
standing in long lines in the hot sun ... it's remarkable.''
   Most of the poor in the capital of Port-au-Prince appeared to
support the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a leftist priest
considered the front-runner among a field of 11 presidential
candidates. Many voiced suspicion that the delays were deliberate
and intended to keep them from voting.
   Aristide was an ardent critic of the Duvalier family
dictatorship that ruled Haiti for 29 years, and holdovers from the
regime had vowed to keep him out of the presidency.
   In Gonaives, about 105 miles northwest of the capital, peasant
organizations said small rice and bean farmers backed Aristide.
They said army officers met with city leaders to try to turn voters
against Aristide.
   Others in Gonaives with ties to the Duvaliers were not so
enthusiastic about Aristide.
   ``There will be no Titid (diminutive for Aristide) for
president. ... It's impossible. You'll see. The country needs a
moderate man,'' said Zacharie Delva, once a leader of the Tonton
Macoutes, the feared private militia used by the Duvalier regime.

<HEAD>Report: Interrogations of Store Employees Stopped</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A convience store chain accused of
pressuring employees into admitting theft has stopped the
interrogations, according to store employees and attorneys.
   Cumberland Farms, which has 1,200 stores and hundreds of gas
stations in 11 states, has denied the allegations.
   Store employees and attorneys indicate that no Cumberland Farms
cashiers have been interrogated or asked to sign a confession since
September, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday.
   The newspaper has reported that since 1976, 30,000 employees
have been fired after being questioned, and hundreds said they paid
money to the company, from 59 cents to $14,000, after being falsely
accused.
   The publicity has prompted the convenience-store company to
``change its ways,'' said Lynn Aaby, a public defender in New
Hampshire.
   ``The numbers have literally gone to zero,'' said Michael Rubin,
assistant state attorney for Martin County, Fla., whose office
handled many Cumberland Farms theft cases in four years.
   Cumberland Farms vice president Foster Macrides has said the
company never had a policy of coercing employees.
   Former employees have filed three civil lawsuits against the
Canton, Mass.,-based company, including one in Camden, N.J., that
charges the company's policy was to make up for inventory losses by
accusing employees of stealing and forcing them to pay.

   An explosion Sunday afternoon inside a
Sears store at a shopping mall forced evacuation of the store, but
caused no injuries and little damage, police said.
   Authorities believe that a stick of dynamite inside a
refrigerator on display in the store's major-appliances department
caused it. No other store at the Tri-County Mall was evacuated.
   Springdale police Lt. Jeff Hermann described the explosion as
minor and said only the refrigerator was damaged. He said no other
explosive devices had been found. He did not know the means of
detonation.
   James Freland, the police chief in this community about 12 miles
northeast of Cincinnati in southwestern Ohio, said police had no
suspects or motive.
   The store was closed after the blast, and employees were sent
home for the day, police said.
   Hermann said that Sears had not received any threat before the
explosion. No threats were received at the Springdale Police or
Hamilton County Sheriff's departments.

   Albanian authorities will bring to trial
more than 150 people arrested during a wave of riots in that
country, Europe's last Stalinist nation, official Albanian radio
reported Sunday.
   Radio Tirana said the trials for the 157 detainees could begin
as early as Monday.
   Albanian chief investigator Chemal Lame was quoted as saying the
rioters faced charges ranging from illegal assembly to theft and
inflicting injury, according to the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug,
which monitored the broadcast. The radio did not say what penalties
the defendants could face.
   At least 16 people were injured and many buildings and vehicles
were damaged in the unrest.
   The report said 60 people were arrested in the northern city of
Shkodra Thursday, and 55 people were detained in the central city
of Elbasan, which was racked by violence Friday.
   Another 42 people were detained in the central coastal city of
Durres, the radio said, according to Tanjug, monitored in Vienna.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said it monitored a similar
report in London.
   The country was reported quiet Sunday and troops have been
withdrawn, a journalist for Albania's state news agency said from
Tirana, the capital.
   The journalist said the normal number of police now patrolled
the cities of Skhodra, Elbasan, Durres and Kavaje, the centers of
the rioting.
   Communist President Ramiz Alia on Saturday condemned the
violence and said such ``criminal activity'' would not be
tolerated.
   Also Sunday, a spokesman for Albania's first non-Communist party
said it plans to seek formal registration with the government this
week to contest parliamentary elections.
   Last week, the Communists, for the first time since taking power
in 1944, announced they would allow the formation of alternative
parties. The leadership apparently bowed to pressure by protesting
students in the capital.
   On Wednesday, students, intellectuals and others founded the
first such party to the cheers of thousands of supporters at a
rally and said they hoped to compete in parliamentary elections set
for Feb. 10.
   Genc Pollo, a spokesman for the new Democratic Party of Albania,
said the party would seek registration with the government as early
as Monday. He said the new party also sought to postpone the
parliamentary vote to give it more time to campaign.
   Pollo said Parliament was expected to issue a decree on the
formation of parties, also as early as Monday. According to the
decree, the government would have 30 days to reply to a
registration request, he said.
   Gramoz Paskho, an economist and leader of the new party, said in
a telephone interview that the government must formally approve the
new party to show that it serious about promises of reform.
   ``It will show the Albanian people and the rest of the world it
is a serious government if it does what it promises,'' he said.
``If they delay it, they will create a kind of impasse.''
   Although the party is only five days old, it appeared already to
have widespread support. Pollo said in a telephone interview from
Tirana that it has been receiving letters of support from prominent
scholars, artists and writers.
   He said the party estimated that it has the support of about
20,000 people in the tiny country of 3.2 million. The Communist
Party claims more than 120,000 members.

   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. (AP) - There is sex galore in this
magazine.
   There is homosexuality and bisexuality and bestiality and
miscegenation and just about every other permutation of sexual
conduct known to men and women.
   But don't contact the authorities. The treatment these
sensational topics receive in the gray pages of the Journal of the
History of Sexuality is more likely to send the average reader to a
thesaurus than a cold shower.
   ``It's scholars talking to other scholars about research and
important scholarly studies using all of the methodology and
approaches that are used in social science research,'' said Robert
Shirrell of the University of Chicago Press, publisher of the
journal. ``It's not going to be, nor would it serve its function if
it were, a publication for a general audience.''
   Articles in the first two issues covered such subjects as ``Holy
Harlots,'' a study of prostitute saints in medieval Europe; the
homosexual habits of actors on the 18th century London stage; and
early writings and research on syphilis in 15th and 16th century
England.
   Studies of Old Norse sexuality and marriage rituals in
modern-day Morocco have been lined up for future issues.
   The quarterly journal is edited by John Fout, 53, a professor of
modern European history at Bard College, a small liberal arts
school 100 miles north of New York City.
   While researching sexual politics topics such as the forced
sterilization policies of Nazi Germany, Fout said he discovered no
journal on sex was devoted to the works of scholar-authors like
himself.
   Studies in the field were dominated instead by sexologists -
researchers like Masters and Johnson doing medically based studies
of sexual behavior - or by pyschologists working on the mental
aspects of sexuality, Fout said.
   He said he decided to start a new journal that would ``publish
the best and the newest and the most critical theoretical
scholarship from scholars around the world.''
   The journal, which debuted in July, is the 51st scholarly
publication produced by the University of Chicago Press.
   Fout said the works in his journal represent a largely new and
unconventional way of looking at the sexual history of mankind.
   Most of the study of human sexuality during the past generation
has centered on ``how the body works,'' he said. The studies in his
journal examine instead the way sexual behavior has been molded by
the influences within society and culture, such as religion,
politics and government.
   For instance, an article in the second issue of the journal
explores the condom's struggle for legal and social acceptance in
20th century America. Author Joshua Gamson said his research only
``peripherally'' deals with sex, and that it might have been
difficult to get his piece published in a science-based sexual
journal.
   ``There aren't many places where I could have placed an article
on condoms,'' said Gamson, 27, a doctoral student at the University
of California, Berkeley.
   The journal does not pay contributors. Scholars whose articles
or book reviews are published are offered 10 free copies of the
issue or a year's free subscription, an arrangement that Fout said
is standard for such publications.
   So far, the journal has about 1,000 paid subscribers,
respectable for a first-year publication, Shirrell said. Most
copies can be found in college libraries. Fout said a few
bookstores have agreed to sell the journal.
   ``We undertake publications with the expectation that they will
continue indefinitely,'' Shirrell said. ``This is going to be an
important area for academic research for a number of years.''

<HEAD>Baker Remains Hopeful He Can Go To Baghdad To Discuss Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said Sunday he still hopes to revive the stalled American
proposal for talks with Saddam Hussein.
   He said he wants to travel to Baghdad to see Iraqi President
Saddam by Jan. 3 at the latest to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis.
But he gave no indication Saddam was about to agree to any of 15
dates, from Dec. 20 through Jan. 3, that the administration says it
has proposed for a Baghdad meeting.
   ``We hope something can be arranged,'' Baker said of stalled
efforts for U.S.-Iraq talks.
   He added, ``There is no back channel talking going on'' with
Baghdad. And he would not comment on what diplomatic moves he was
planning to secure a visit to Baghdad, except to say, ``Stay
tuned.''
   Bush's meeting Monday with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in
Washington has been put off due to Saddam's refusal to set an early
date for a return visit by Baker.
   Saddam has offered to meet Baker Jan. 12, three days before the
U.N deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face military
force.
   President Bush proposed the high-level talks, saying he hopes to
discuss Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait. But Iraq says it intends to
keep Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2.
   Baker's remarks were contained in a transcript of comments he
made to reporters as he flew to Brussels for a two-day NATO foreign
ministers meeting.
   He said that at the NATO meeting, which starts Monday, he will
discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with the allies and appeal for
additional help in moving U.S. troops and materiel to the gulf.

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commanding officer at the Orlando Naval
Training Center has been cleared of accusations he was dating a
lower-ranking female sailor in violation of military policy.
   A naval investigation found no evidence to support allegations
that Cmdr. John Fullerton was having an improper relationship with
a third-class petty officer, said Rear Adm. Louise Wilmot,
commanding officer of the center.
   Wilmot spent six hours Saturday interviewing Fullerton, the
unidentified woman and eight other people before reaching her
conclusion, a base spokeswoman said.
   Navy rules prohibit officers from dating enlisted personnel and
ban social contact between students and instructors. The training
center is under investigation by the Pentagon for its handling of
sexual assault cases and enforcement of rules concerning social
relationships.
   Fullerton, 41, was transferred to other duties at the Naval and
Marine Corps Reserve Center in Orlando during the inquiry. He will
return to his post Monday as second in command of the division that
handles housing, food recreation and other services.
   Lt. Cmdr. Nettie Johnson, a base spokeswoman, said Friday that
an anonymous caller to the base legal department hotline accused
Fullerton of having a long-term relationship with the female
sailor. The caller also alleged that at a party on Nov. 24 he got
into a hot tub with ``seminude'' women.
   Both Fullerton, who is married, and the female petty officer
denied any romantic involvement
   Fullerton was at the party and acknowledged getting into the hot
tub but witnesses said everyone was appropriately clothed.
   Fullerton was not immediately available for comment, but
according to Johnson, ``he said he and his wife were exhausted from
the ordeal and they are glad it's over.''
   A high-level Navy probe in July criticized the Naval
Investigative Service for the way it treated some women rape
victims at the training center during questioning. The NIS is the
Navy's investigative arm.
   The report, however, noted the Wilmot - who once headed the
Navy's equal opportunity office for women - has improved the
working climate and health benefits for female sailors since taking
command of the base in May 1989.
   Last week, a military judge ordered four male instructors to
stand trial on charges that they dated or made sexual advances
toward students or recruits.
   A second team of Pentagon investigators was scheduled Monday to
begin a survey of all female employees at the base to determine
whether sexual harassment or improper relationships is an large
problem there.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has offered 500 tons of dates to the
Soviet Union as part of international efforts to help tide the
Soviets through the winter, the official news agency said Sunday.
   The Iraqi News Agency quoted the chairman of the Iraqi Red
Crescent, Dr. Ibrahim al-Nouri, as saying the organization's offer
came ``as a gift from the Iraqi people to the Soviet people out of
the spirit of traditional friendship between the two peoples.''
   The news agency, which is monitored in Nicosia, said the Soviets
had been made aware of the offer but had not responded.
   The Soviets expect severe food shortages during the winter, and
many Western countries, including the United States, have responded
with an outpouring of aid.
   This is the first reported offer of aid from Iraq, which was
Moscow's main Middle East ally and received much of its weaponry
from the Soviet Union before its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Since
the invasion, the two nations have been at odds.

   Donald Trump got some help with a
mortgage Sunday by auctioning 35 luxury waterfront condominiums
overlooking the ritz and fame of this high-society resort.
   The units in the twin 32-story towers at Trump Plaza of the Palm
Beaches sold for $8.815 million, 24 percent above the total asking
price. However, the asking prices had been slashed by up to
two-thirds.
   ``We far exceeded our expectations today. This was a tremendous
sale for Trump Plaza,'' Trump said. ``I think it could work out to
be a very good deal, depending on what ultimately happens with the
final numbers.''
   Previous asking prices of $300,960 to $1.8 million for the
penthouse were trimmed to minimum bids of $150,000 to $600,000
under pressure from Marine Midland Bank. The bank wanted Trump to
unload the units that had gone unsold since the developer took over
the building in 1986, boasting the complex would be Florida's
hottest property.
   Developer Ian Kean of nearby Singer Island bought the penthouse
for $720,000.
   The building's biggest drawback, local real estate experts say,
is location. The property is on the wrong side of the Intracoastal
Waterway in this prestige-conscious neighborhood.
   The auction took place on the right side - in a
chandelier-bedecked ballroom at The Breakers, a grand dame hotel on
this barrier island. Trump's 118-room Mar-a-Lago weekend retreat is
also on the more prestigous side of the waterway.
   About 85 of the 221 units remain vacant or unsold. Officials
said Trump made the decision not to auction all units, and said no
decision had been made on their disposal.
   Trump missed a $27.1 million payment Oct. 22 to Marine Midland,
which loaned him the money to buy the building. In a restructuring
agreement in August, Trump's lenders pushed him into the auction
because sales had been so sluggish. Only one sale had been recorded
this year.
   As the auction catalog says, ``glorious sun-drenched days evolve
into dazzling moonlit nights'' at the towers overlooking the
waterway and this resort town.
   The Trump Plaza has a sumptuous lobby with walls of marble and
leather, a concierge, valet parking, morning and afternoon pools,
sunning terraces, a fitness center and tennis courts.
   But the units are largely unfinished.
   ``I think that was disappointing, because that was not announced
prior to our coming down here,'' said Bobbe Jacobson, of Boston, a
professional party planner.
   Trump is also due to make $34.5 million in payments to
bondholders who invested in two of his Atlantic City casinos. The
formal deadline for the $18.4 million payment on the Trump Castle
and a $16.1 million payment on the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino was
Saturday, but Trump was given until Monday to cover the bills
because of the weekend.
   If he fails to meet the deadlines Monday, he will be given a
10-day grace period to turn over the bond money on Trump Castle. He
would also have 30 days to make the payment on the Trump Plaza
Hotel and Casino.

<HEAD>Official: One-Third Of Eastern Germans Will Be Short of Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official said in a newspaper interview Sunday
that one-third of the workers in former East Germany will be
jobless or working reduced hours this summer.
   Reiner Herbst, chief of the employment agency responsible for
the former nation, told the Berliner Morgenpost that 3 million of
the roughly 8.8 million workers will have lost their jobs by this
summer or will be working shorter hours at lower pay.
   As of November, about 600,000 workers were officially
unemployed. Independent economists have said joblessness could
reach 3 million to 4 million next year.
   East Germany converted from a socialist economy to a free market
on July 1 and unified with West Germany on Oct. 3. Many enterprises
will either close or reduce payrolls because of the new Western
competition.
   Herbst said he believes the job market will begin to pick up in
1992 after new Western investment moves in. The government is
counting on Western capitalists to fill the employment void created
by the collapse of former state-run enterprises.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino, under
public pressure to shore up the economy, on Sunday announced the
resignation of her trade minister.
   However, she said calls for her to step down are ``figments of
the imagination'' of her enemies.
   In a nationwide television address, Mrs. Aquino said Secretary
Jose Concepcion handed in his resignation Tuesday but would be
retained until Jan. 2 to help the country through its economic
crisis. No replacement was named.
   Political sources, speaking on condition of nonymity, said
other Cabinet changes are expected.
   Mrs. Aquino acknowledged she was bowing to public pressure for
changes in her administration after a stunning 45 percent increase
in fuel prices coupled with a declining economy.
   ``I've told him that what I'm doing is in response to grievances
of some sectors in our society,'' she said of Concepcion. ``It is
truly difficult to be separated from familiar friends, especially
those who have proven their faith and conviction.''
   Concepcion played no major role in the price increase. But he
had been under fire for allegedly failing to divest holdings in
family businesses which prospered under the Aquino administration.
   Mrs. Aquino noted that a Senate panel cleared Concepcion of
wrongdoing. She said nonetheless that she was accepting his
resignation to help maintain national harmony.
   Concepcion's resignation followed the replacement of Mrs.
Aquino's executive secretary, Catalino Macaraig, who had also
served as the government's energy coordinator.
   In her remarks Sunday, Mrs. Aquino also acknowledged opposition
calls for her to resign or call early elections. Four of the 23
senators, including three elected on the administration ticket,
have joined those calls.
   ``The call for the resignation of the president has no meaning
or significance but are figments of the imagination of people who
thrive on illusions,'' she said.

   Central American leaders agreed
Sunday to a statement condemning a new offensive by rebels in El
Salvador's 11-year civil war.
   ``We cannot condone the Salvadoran guerrillas' unleashing of
indiscriminate violence, just at a time when an end to it is being
sought through dialogue and negotiation,'' Costa Rican President
Rafael Calderon said.
   He said the five Central American presidents at the summit will
make a proposal Monday to the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front to resume peace talks with President Alfredo
Cristiani's government.
   Earlier Sunday, Cristiani pressed other leders to issue the
anti-rebel statement.
   The guerrilla offensive has dominated the meeting of Central
American presidents, who have also discussed economic issues and
plans to invite Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to visit the
region. The three-day meeting is scheduled to conclude Monday.
   Cristiani, who leads a right-wing government, has said
repeatedly that his government is willing to meet with the rebels,
but formal negotiations ended in September without significant
progress.
   In other issues, summit participants said Nicaraguan President
Violeta Chamorro will deliver the invitation to Gorbachev to come
to Central America when she visits Moscow in February.
   Also attending the conference are Guatemalan President Vinicio
Cerezo and President Leonardo Callejas of Honduras. President
Guillermo Endara of Panama attended as an observer.
   In the final communique, the presidents also are expected to
call for international action to protect the environment,
elimination of visas for diplomats and businessmen traveling in the
region, and strengthening the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Central
America.

   Hundreds of Haitians rallied in the streets of
Miami's Little Haiti on Sunday, cheering for their favorite
candidates and closely monitoring the first fully free presidential
elections in their homeland.
   The crowd overwhelmingly favored the Rev. Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, a populist priest who has the admiration of many Haitians
here. They said Aristide represents a different class and
background than Haiti's line of upper-class, suppressive leaders,
and will bring real change.
   ``Today we need a president that we can put all our trust in
(so) that Haitians will have a better tomorrow,'' said Jacqui Prime
as a crowd estimated by Haitians at more than 4,000 danced, carried
posters and chanted Aristide's name. Miami police could not provide
a crowd estimate.
   ``Public schools, hospitals ... we want it for the Haitian
kids,'' said Mona Michel. ``(Aristide) will negotiate with the
foreign governments for us, not for his pocket.''
   Aristide campaigned in Miami on Nov. 2, drawing support from
more than 7,000 people. Haitians in Miami, where the largest number
of immigrants came around 1980, now number more than 100,000.
   Marc Bazin, a former World Bank official seen as Aristide's
closest rival and a favorite of Haiti's business community, drew
far smaller crowds during his campaign stop in Miami.
   Some Haitians returned home in recent weeks to vote, many have
contributed money to presidential candidates, and most also have
influence with relatives and friends at home who may be impressed
with how candidates are viewed and reported upon in this country.
   Tension was also high in Little Haiti in light of the violent
break-up of a rally by Aristide on Dec. 5 in Haiti and the Election
Day massacre three years ago in which at least 34 people were
killed.

<DATELINE>PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police launched a nationwide manhunt
Sunday for more than 65 inmates following the second recent mass
jailbreak from an overcrowded prison.
   A police spokesman said 15 of the 81 prisoners who broke out of
Korydallos prison Saturday had been recaptured by late Sunday.
   The escapees were mostly ``burglars and thieves'' and did not
include maximum-security prisoners including convicted murderers,
suspect terrorists and some of Greece's most notorious felons.
   Lack of jail space has forced police to use the prison for
general inmates and as a holding facility for suspects awaiting
trial. Korydallos, located in the port city of Piraeus near Athens,
houses about 800 prisoners.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
escape was the largest ever in Greece.
   According to the spokesman, the escape began when inmates
overpowered some guards and took their keys.
   ``They couldn't unlock the (kitchen) door so they tore it off
its hinges and escaped through the psychiatric ward whose gates
were unlocked,'' he said.
   Police guards fired machine gun volleys over the heads of
fleeing prisoners, the spokesman said.
   ``They didn't have shoot-to-kill orders,'' he said. Police
arrested eight inmates on the spot.
   More than 20 prisoners escaped from the prison during a 28-day
uprising that ended on Nov. 12. They were all recaptured.
   Mohammed Rashid, a Palestinian suspected of planting a bomb
aboard a Pan American World Airways jet in 1982, has been held at
Korydallos since his arrest in 1988. Rashid will be tried in Greece
although the United States asked for his extradition.
   Leaders of the 1967-74 military dictatorship are serving life
terms in a separate wing of the prison. They did not take part in
the jail break.

   Many Marine reservists activated for duty in the
Persian Gulf have never trained for desert warfare, so the corps is
bringing the desert to them.
   Reservists joining Operation Desert Shield will get a taste of
how to fight in the desert from a laser video being produced for a
special simulator.
   ``There are substantial differences ... as to the way things
appear in the desert,'' said Maj. Lowell Grubbs, an assistant
training officer at the 4th Marine Division in New Orleans.
``Distances are hard to estimate; it's a flat terrain with little
cover.''
   Firearms Training Systems Inc., based in the Atlanta suburb of
Norcross, is producing the video for use with its simulator, which
36 Marine Reserve Centers already use.
   Before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, the company had mainly
provided video rifle ranges or green environments for Marines to
practice with the simulator, shooting in jungles they likely would
face in southeast Asia or Central America.
   The desert video, completed this month, will go first to the 4th
Marine Division, said Grubbs, who participated in the filming.
   It then will be distributed to other Marine reserve centers by
the beginning of next month. It may go to Saudi Arabia for use by
Marines already stationed there, said Jeff Marlin, a spokesman for
Firearms Training Systems Inc.
   The Marines' simulators, which cost $70,000 apiece, consist of a
computer that projects a video onto a large screen. Speakers
provide background noise. Squadrons of four soldiers at a time
shoot at the screen with M-16 rifles, which are rigged to simulate
gunshots.
   ``It touches a lot of your senses,'' Grubbs said.
   An instructor sits at the computer acting as commanding officer.
   ``There's still a lot of human impact on this system - it's not
a video game,'' he said.
   After the simulation, the instructor rewinds the video and each
soldier's shots - represented on the film by numbered dots - are
reviewed.
   Grubbs said the simulators are more realistic than regular rifle
ranges with pop-up cardboard targets.
   ``People move differently than cardboard targets,'' he said.
``It takes different techniques to actually hit a moving person.'
   With this video, soldiers will also practice firing while
wearing gas masks, in case they face chemical warfare in Iraq.
   Marlin said the video also includes a shoot-don't shoot scenario
in which the Marines must decide if people rapidly appearing are a
threat or innocent civilians, adding, ``They may have to go into
Kuwait City and will be faced with that situation.''
   He put the cost of the training at ``less than one-tenth of a
cent a round ... plus it's right in the classroom.''

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 300 illegal Chinese aliens
banged pots and shouted slogans Monday during a protest in an
overcrowded military detention camp to demand immediate
repatriation to China.
   The Taiwan Garrison Command, a military agency, said the protest
was under way at the detention center in Lotung, 43 miles southeast
of Taipei. It is the largest of four such centers for illegal
Chinese aliens.
   Television broadcasts showed inmates banging the barred windows
and shouting ``Let us return!'' and ``Reporters help us!'' early
Monday while about 200 military police ran into the center.
   The military agency declined to say if the situation was under
control.
   Local newspapers said the Chinese requested immediate
repatriation in the same boats they used to come to Taiwan.
   The reports quoted the Chinese as saying that if they were
returned to China on Taiwanese boats they would be fined by Chinese
authorities. They also demanded better housing while in Taiwan.
   It was the second day of protests at the center. On Sunday, the
inmates refused to eat and overturned tables to demand immediate
repatriation.
   The Chinese entered Taiwan illegally to work at jobs that pay
more than on the Communist mainland. Authorities estimate more than
10,000 Chinese have sneaked into Taiwan since 1987, when the
Nationalist government ended 38 years of martial law and eased
restrictions on contacts between Taiwan and China.
   The two territories have technically been at war since 1949,
when Communist Chinese forces chased Nationalist Chinese troops
from mainland China to the island of Taiwan.
   Red Cross associations in Taiwan and China supervise the
repatriation program.
   Taiwan's Red Cross Association said about 600 Chinese were being
kept in detention centers in Taiwan. It urged its counterpart in
China to expedite the screening of aliens for repatriation.

<HEAD>Honeywell Investigated on Possible Sale of Missile Guidance System
to Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is investigating whether
Honeywell plans for a sophisticated missile guidance system were
sold to Iraq through a Swiss arms broker, a newspaper reported
Sunday.
   The Star Tribune said it was unknown whether the Honeywell
technology is in the hands of the Iraqis, who have been scavenging
Western defense technology for at least six years, defense experts
said.
   ``We're looking into everything and anything Honeywell may have
done transferring technology to Iraq,'' Defense Department
spokesman Rick Oborn said last week.
   The guidance system could give any missile deadly precision, and
weapons experts said the possibility of Iraq possessing that
technology could be more worrisome than its purchase of a study for
a bomb called a fuel-air explosive.
   It was reported two weeks ago that Iraq obtained the 300-page
technical study made by the Minneapolis-based defense contractor in
1984 for $100,000 in a deal with IFAT, a Swiss arms broker.
   Pentagon sources told the Star Tribune last week that they are
investigating Honeywell to determine whether one of its executives
sold plans for a ring laser gyroscope to IFAT in 1984.
   The device, which employs lasers and mirrors, can be used to
guide aircraft as well as missiles. It is considered the heart of
Honeywell guidance systems.
   Weapons experts speculate that the Iraqis would employ the
technology with missiles loaded with either chemical weapons or
explosives such as the fuel-air explosive.
   Iraq also has been working on a nuclear bomb, intelligence
sources say.
   Honeywell acknowledged that investigators from the Defense
Technology Security Administration met with company officials
Tuesday to discuss the bomb study and other possible sales to IFAT.
Pentagon officials asked the company to look for documents that
would indicate whether plans for the ring laser gyroscope were sold
to IFAT.
   ``We have not been able to find any information to support that
inertial guidance technology was transferred to IFAT,'' Honeywell
spokeswoman Susan Eich said Friday.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Haitians voted peacefully Sunday as
nearly 1,000 international observers monitored elections that
appeared to be the most democratic ever in Haiti. Some backers of
the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide celebrated, claiming their
candidate won.
   One international observer said most of the foreign
poll-watchers believe Aristide, a leftist priest, had won, though
the first official results were not expected until noon Monday.
   The observer said their belief was based on what they had seen
of voting results, but he provided no numbers. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Jean-Robert Sabalat, president of the independent Electoral
Council, declared, ``The voters participated in the electoral
process with an exemplary calm, which one of our visitors called
the ``Haitian miracle.'
   ``This time the army was equal to its task,'' he said.
   He thanked international observers for their help and said, ``We
have just lived together a great day in our history.''
   Supporters of the Aristide, who had been considered a
front-runner, took to the streets Sunday night in at least one area
of downtown Port-au-Prince to celebrate what they regarded as his
sure victory as president.
   About 200 people, many chanting Aristide's name and dancing in
the streets, took part in the early victory celebration. The
celebration appeared confined to that area, however.
   No violent incidents were reported through the day, but there
appeared to be some major delays. Some polling stations were kept
open after the 6 p.m. closing time.
   Police and soldiers with automatic weapons guarded many polling
places Port-au-Prince, the capital, seeking to avoid a repeat of an
Election Day massacre three years ago in which at least 34 people
were killed.
   The international airport remained open but airlines canceled
scheduled arriving flights in case of disturbances.
   Ismael Diallo, a spokesman for a U.N. observer team, said Sunday
night that voting apparently was peaceful throughout the country
and there appeared to have been a large turnout.
   ``The armed forces and the security forces have been very
professional,'' Diallo said. Given Haiti's violent history, he
said: ``It's really very, very positive.''
   However, he said long delays occurred in many areas because of
difficulty in distributing voting materials.
   Police in riot gear were deployed in the sprawling slum of Cite
Soleil after polling stations in the area opened several hours
late.
   About 50 police blocked a highway to stop what appeared to be
the start of a march downtown by hundreds of angry residents, many
waving cut branches, a traditional symbol of protest or
celebration. However, there were no clashes.
   The seaside slum is a stronghold of support for Aristide, and
many residents blamed his opponents for the delay in distributing
ballots and ballot boxes.
   Five hours after polls were to open, voting had begun in only
one of 50 polling stations in the area.
   ``It is either lack of preparation by the Electoral Council, or
sabotage,'' said Shiller Marcellin, president of a large labor
federation.
   Election officials, however, attributed the delays to logistical
problems.
   ``We've had a lot of (international) help, but not enough,''
said Daniel Bernier, the district election bureau director, whose
office was cluttered with undelivered ballots and ballot boxes.
   He said he did not have enough trucks distribute voting
materials.
   No results from the nation's 14,500 polling stations were
expected before noon Monday because of poor communications, the
Electoral Council said.
   Nearly 3 million people, or 85 percent of the electorate, were
registered to vote.
   The election was monitored by about 800 international observers,
including former President Jimmy Carter.
   Carter arrived early at the Argentine Bellegrade secondary
school, where thugs protected by the army shot and hacked to death
14 voters on Nov. 29, 1987. At least 20 others were gunned down in
the streets, giving the military regime of that time a pretext for
calling off the election.
   Subsequent elections in January 1988 were controlled by the army
and boycotted by most of the main contenders in 1987.
   ``We wanted to come here as a symbolic thing to show the people
of Haiti that it's safe to vote today,'' said Carter, who was
accompanied by his wife, Rosalynn, and daughter, Amy.
   Several voters waiting to cast ballots in the ramshackle school
building and open-air classrooms said they were not afraid.
   ``No, I came with all my heart,'' said Sander Destine, 27, when
asked if he feared violence. ``I'm happy to have elections. I'm
happy to have a leader,'' he said, referring to Aristide.
   Aristide, 37, a leftist Roman Catholic priest with a huge
following among the majority poor, was widely regarded as the most
popular of 11 presidential candidates. Expectations of an Aristide
victory were running so high that some feared disturbances if he
failed to win.
   If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff
is to be held on Jan. 20.
   The new government will replace the caretaker administration of
President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, a Supreme Court justice appointed
in March to lead Haiti to democratic elections.
   Aristide, dressed all in white, cast his ballot at the capital's
Claire Heureuse secondary school. He was mobbed by supporters, some
jubilantly mimicking the crow of a rooster, his campaign symbol.
   Marc Bazin, 58, a former World Bank official seen as Aristide's
closest rival and a favorite of the business community, was voting
in Petionville, a suburb where a grenade-and-gun attack on Dec. 5
left seven dead and more than 50 wounded at an Aristide campaign
rally.
   Despite fears that supporters of the 29-year Duvalier
dictatorship would disrupt the election, the Dec. 5 attack was the
only election-related violence during the campaign, which began in
October.
   The president is to be inaugurated on Feb. 7, 1991, the fifth
anniversary of the fall of Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, whose
father, Francois ``Papa Doc,'' died in 1971.
   Haitians also were electing 110 members of a bicameral National
Assembly, 134 mayors, 268 municipal council members and 1,695
county officials.
   The impoverished nation of 6 million people has been ruled
almost exclusively by dictators since gaining independence from
France in 1804 after a slave revolt.
   Since the younger Duvalier fled into exile in France after a
popular uprising, the country has been ruled by five different
governments.
   The international observers also included representatives from
the United Nations and the Organization of American States. It was
the first time the United Nations had granted a request by a member
nation to oversee its election.

   Asil Nadir, chairman and chief executive officer
of the troubled Polly Peck empire, was charged Sunday with 18
offenses of theft and false accounting.
   The 48-year-old Turkish-Cypriot businessman, who was arrested
Saturday at Heathrow Airport as he arrived from Turkey, is to
appear before Bow Street magistrates court Monday, police said.
   In a brief statement outside London's Holborn police station
where Nadir was being questioned, Detective Superintendent David
Staff of the Serious Fraud Office said the charges were in
connection with Polly Peck International PLC.
   Two other men who were arrested earlier Sunday had been
interviewed and released without being charged, Staff said. Their
names were not disclosed.
   Scotland Yard's fraud squad has been investigating alleged
irregularities in dealings in Polly Peck's stock.
   The fruit and electronics giant was put in the hands of
court-appointed administrators in October after its shares
collapsed on the stock market. They are trying to deal with the
company's 1.3 billion pound, or $2.5 billion, debt.
   Nadir has personal debts estimated at 40 million pounds, or $76
million.
