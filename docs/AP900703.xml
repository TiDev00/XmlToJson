<HEAD>Japan Opposes Log-Export Limits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan is putting pressure on the Bush
administration to ease restrictions on log exports, a newspaper
reported Tuesday.
   According to The Oregonian, Ryohei Murata, Japanese ambassador
to the United States, wrote a letter to U.S. Trade Representative
Carla A. Hills on June 15 asking the government to oppose tougher
export restrictions.
   The newspaper, which obtained a copy of the letter, said Murata
wrote that the restrictions ``seriously impede trade between the
two countries.''
   ``We are especially concerned with the fact that there are
active movements in the U.S. Congress to further strengthen log
export restrictions,'' Murata wrote. ``We strongly request that the
U.S. government take effective actions to oppose such legislation.''
   Japan, the biggest foreign buyer of U.S. logs, imported 4.7
billion board feet of logs from the United States last year. China
imported about 1.7 billion board feet and South Korea imported less
than half that amount.
   Legislation is moving through Congress that would make permanent
the annual ban on exporting federal logs from the West, except
Alaskan logs, and ban log exports from most state lands.
   The Bush administration supported such measures June 19 in a
statement about declining timber supplies and the listing of the
northern spotted owl as a threatened species.
   Some proponents of a log export ban believe it would encourage
overseas buyers to use U.S. sawmills.
   Japan's foreign ministry says the existing ban on exports of
federal logs in the West violates the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, the international agreement governing most trade, as
would further restrictions. U.S. forest products industry leaders
also oppose the legislation, fearing losses to Japanese sawmills.
   Hills said in a reply to Murata that the administration had told
Congress of concerns about the effects of trade restrictions.
   ``We will continue to seek to ensure that any actions taken in
this area, especially in the context of domestic conservation
programs, are to the maximum extent possible consistent with our
international obligations,'' Hills said.
   Shotaro Yachi, economic counselor at the Japanese Embassy in
Washington, called Hills' letter vague.
   ``We wanted a strong commitment,'' Yachi said. ``We have been
importing logs from your country, and we'd like to continue.''
   Japan has about 17,500 sawmills, which employ 131,000 workers.
Nishitani could not estimate the number of jobs that depend on U.S.
log imports.
   Japan imports logs duty-free, but levies tariffs on many
processed wood products. Washington persuaded Tokyo during the
yearlong wood products talks to lower some tariffs to boost exports
of finished lumber to Japan.

<HEAD>British Transport Secretary Meets Man Who Fooled Guards With Fake
Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson says his
department will investigate how a man testing security at London's
Heathrow airport was able to check a fake bomb aboard a British
Airways flight to the United States.
   The man, Dr. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was among those
killed in the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 met with
Parkinson earlier Monday and detailed how he managed to fool guards
at Heathrow in the May test.
   Swire heads a group of British relatives of the disaster's
victims called U.K. Families-Flight 103.
   The bomb aboard Flight 103 exploded as the passenger jet flew
over Lockerbie, Scotland on its way to New York, killing all 259
people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 others on the ground. Flight
103 originated in Frankfurt in West Germany, changing planes at
Heathrow.
   Swire told reporters after his 90-minute meeting with Parkinson
and other aviation officials that he would continue to press
British authorities to improve airline security.
   ``I think you will find we will not go away until they have,''
he said.
   Swire disclosed details of his privately organized security test
in a radio interview Sunday. He said the device he used was a
non-explosive replica of the one that exploded over Lockerbie.
   British and U.S. investigators have said they believe the bomb
that downed Flight 103 was placed by Palestinian terrorists and had
a barometric trigger set to detonate at a predetermined altitude.
   Swire said in the interview Sunday that the fake device he used
at Heathrow in May was packed in a radio-cassette recorder, like
the Lockerbie bomb, but used marzipan icing instead of Semtex
plastic explosives.
   ``It had a dummy detonator which would have shown up on X-ray,
an extra printed circuit board, extra batteries, pressure
transducer and so on, all wired up in a form that would have worked
if the marzipan had been replaced with Semtex,'' he said in the
interview.
   ``Our flight was selected for what they call special security,
and our cases were opened and searched in front of us. The
radio-cassette recorder was picked up, and I was asked whether I
had taken the batteries out, and I correctly replied, `Yes, I had
taken the batteries out.' It was then replaced in the suitcase and
is now in America.''

<HEAD>Bush Proposal Revives Debate Over Use of Nuclear Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is suggesting a change in
NATO's nuclear doctrine that is a modest shift away from atomic
brinkmanship, analysts say. But the Cold War question remains: when
would the West use its deadly nuclear arms?
   That question has confounded allied leaders for most of NATO's
41-year history.
   The answer has never been clear. But the issue is regaining a
policy spotlight as the Western allies try to overhaul the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and adjust their defense strategies to
political changes in Eastern Europe.
   Administration sources said Monday that Bush will propose at a
NATO summit Thursday that alliance doctrine be revised to declare
that nuclear arms are ``weapons of last resort.''
   Such a statement, if endorsed as official NATO policy, would be
at least a small step away from the existing doctrine, known as
``flexible response,'' according to private analysts interviewed
Monday.
   ``Flexible response'' holds that U.S. nuclear arms could be
fired during the early stages of a European ground war started by
Soviet non-nuclear forces, if NATO troops were being overrun.
   By calling U.S. nuclear forces in Europe ``weapons of last
resort,'' Bush is suggesting the United States would wait longer to
initiate a nuclear battle than it would under existing NATO
doctrine, said John Steinbruner, director of foreign policy studies
at the Brookings Institution, a liberal-oriented Washington think
tank.
   It's unclear how Bush or the allies would define a ``last
resort.''
   The weapons in question are called battlefield nuclear weapons
because they cannot reach beyond central Europe, long considered
the most likely war theater.
   Only if use of these weapons failed to end the conflict would
the United States consider resorting to use of strategic, or
long-range, nuclear weapons.
   Steinbruner said the use of the term ``last resort'' seemed to
suggest the administration was contemplating only a moderate shift
in NATO doctrine, since Bush apparently would not rule out that
NATO could be the first to fire battlefield nuclear weapons.
   ``They're dancing rhetorically around the subject,'' Steinbruner
said.
   The topic is particularly touchy for NATO governments because
while the demise of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact is making nuclear
weapons less important in Europe, no member of the Western alliance
is yet willing to abandon nuclear defenses altogether.
   The London NATO summit is expected to launch a major review of
nuclear strategy. Details of a revised military stance are unlikely
to be worked out for months.
   Frank J. Gaffney, director of the conservative Center for
Security Policy, said he interpreted Bush's proposal as an attempt
to placate the Soviet Union, which argues that the reunification of
Germany requires that NATO drop its military role.
   Gaffney said Bush's proposal would erode the credibility of
NATO, since it would bring the alliance closer to renouncing all
use of nuclear weapons in Europe.
   ``We are, in the name of trying to alleviate Soviet concerns,
going to accede to radical changes in the character of NATO's
traditional security arrangement,'' he said.
   David Shorr, associate director of the British American Security
Information Council, a private organization based in London and
Washington, said Bush's proposal amounts to a rhetorical device
with little substantive meaning.
   He said the proposal was unlikely to help resolve the issue
within NATO regarding when, in a conventional war against the
Soviets, the West would resort to nuclear weapons.
   ``It shows what a delicate dance NATO has had to do around
exactly what `flexible response' means,'' Shorr said.

<HEAD>Barry Finds Support Among Black Activists on Political Fringe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His once-solid support shaken by lurid
courtroom tales of drugs, sex and abuse, Mayor Marion Barry is
finding comfort in the public embrace of black activists on the
political fringe.
   While the murky videotape image of Barry filling his lungs with
crack cocaine replays on the television screens and in the minds of
his city, Washington's mayor has been anything but reclusive.
   He joined Louis Farrakhan, the controversial Nation of Islam
leader, on a stage before thousands of people last week.
   On Sunday, he bathed in ovation and song from the Imani Temple
congregation of Bishop George Augustus Stallings Jr., a flamboyant
black priest who broke from the Roman Catholic church to form his
own denomination.
   Barry also has appeared in recent weeks with Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., a virulent critic of the ``white press.'' Even Tawana
Brawley, whose allegations of kidnap, rape and defilement by whites
were discounted by authorities after creating controversy in New
York, shared a stage with him recently.
   ``He's trying to reach out to whomever will accept him at this
point,'' said Linda Williams, a veteran observer of black politics
and a fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government center for
press and politics.
   ``Many, if not most, of the standard middle-class black leaders
in the nation and in the D.C. area are keeping their distance,''
Williams said. ``Therefore, these are really the only elements that
are openly coming to him at this point.''
   Barry, 54, is a former civil rights leader and street activist
once considered on the political fringes himself. He moved into the
majority-black capital city's political mainstream, however, and
rose through elective offices to mayor, where he is serving his
12th year.
   He now is on trial in federal court on drug and perjury charges
that followed years of investigation. Prosecutors last week played
the videotape of their hotel room sting of Barry.
   Rasheeda Moore, a girlfriend-turned-FBI-informer and a key
prosecution witness, has alleged she and Barry shared illegal drugs
more than 100 times, and that they had a sexual relationship that
ended when Barry slapped her to a hotel room floor.
   In a sideshow that has kept the city's radio talk shows abuzz,
Farrakhan and Stallings tried separately to enter the crowded
courtroom at Barry's invitation.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson barred both, ruling
that their presence could be disruptive and intimidating. He said
Farrakhan ``is a persona non grata'' in the courtroom.
   The American Civil Liberties Union filed papers with the federal
appeals court asking to overturn Jackson's ruling.
   In Farrakhan, Barry has found an ally with whom he previously
has been at odds.
   Farrakhan, who has created controversy for calling Judaism a
``dirty religion,'' delivered a strong attack two months ago on
local political leaders for moral corruption and said they should
be replaced by Muslims.
   But last week, Farrakhan declared Barry a ``repentant soul'' who
is under attack and urged him to run for re-election.
   During a break in the trial Monday, Barry appeared before a
crowd that gathered on a plaza across from City Hall to cheer him.
Also speaking was Abdul Alim Muhammad, Farrakhan's national
spokesman, who called the trial a ``subversion of justice'' and a
``lynching'' conducted because Barry could not be defeated at the
polls.
   Barry said in a television interview on Monday that the crowds
and Farrakhan's embrace at the rally last week have helped sustain
him.
   ``Got a lot of spiritual feeling, a lot of love there,'' Barry
said. ``About 10 to 15,000 people cheered us. Genuine love. That
made us go through the night. ... There's a lot of love in this
city for me.''
   Barry's jury is sequestered and thus insulated from the activity
outside the courtroom. But Ron Walters, chairman of the political
science department at Howard University, said, ``I would be
surprised if some of that didn't get to the jury in some way.''
   Walters said Barry is using the displays to tap a feeling among
many blacks that he has been unfairly pursued by white prosecutors.
   Although Barry has said he won't seek another term, speculation
persists that he might still run as an independent if he is
acquitted or there is a hung jury. The deadline for independents to
file as candidates isn't until late August.
   ``I don't think he has accepted that he is dead politically,''
Williams said.

<TEXT>
   This is a town that is drowning in words,
swimming in information but parched for facts. When decisions have
to be made, the decision-makers, in Congress, in the White House,
in the agencies of government, afloat in data and analysis, still
yearn for the decisive fact that will tell them what to do.
   Would reducing the tax on capital gains give the economy a
booster shot, as President Bush claims, or merely deepen the
deficit gap, as his Democratic opponents say?
   If the House Ways and Means Committee were to announce hearings
on that question today, the corridors would be crowded tomorrow
with experts carrying briefcases loaded with facts to prove
indisputably both sides of the argument.
   Predictive facts _ what would happen if _ are not the only kind
that are hard to come by. So are contemporary facts. Homelessness
is a gnawing social problem, high in the public consciousness, the
subject of strenuous government effort, yet no one knows how many
homeless people are out there, or who they are, or how long they
have been homeless.
   Back in 1971, President Richard Nixon, concerned by inflation,
took the unprecedented step of imposing peacetime wage and price
controls on the economy. Overnight, it became illegal to raise the
price of a Buick or a bagel. It was a radical move for a Republican
president, intended to stem inflation that he saw as threatening to
the economy and his re-election prospects.
   And yet, says Herbert J. Stein, who was one of Nixon's economic
advisers, ``there was a lot of uncertainty about what the rate of
inflation actually was.'' Inflation was, and is, measured in dozens
of ways and no one can say which measurement most accurately
reflects the rise in the price of goods and services.
   That's not all, says Stein: ``We still don't know what caused
the depression in 1929. There's still disagreement over whether
some international thing was moving the whole world or whether it
was the way the monetary system was being managed.
   ``It's hard to get information on a lot of subjects,'' he says.
``Take all the talk on the S&amp;L business. It is hard to find where
all the estimates of losses (which seem to change monthly) come
from. We have very little information about what happened in the
first place.''
   When President Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945 and Vice
President Harry S. Truman suddenly became president, he learned
about the secret work on the atomic bomb and one of the first
decisions he had to make was whether to use it against Japan.
   Fleet Adm. William D. Leahy, chief of staff to Roosevelt, came
to him, Truman recalls in his memoirs, and in absolute certainty
advised him not to use the bomb.
   ```That is the biggest fool thing we have ever done,' he
observed in his sturdy, salty manner,'' Truman writes. ```The bomb
will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives.'''
   That's the trouble with experts, of which this town is also
full. Their opinions always parade as facts.
   Says Charles Schultze, who played the same role for President
Jimmy Carter that Stein played for Nixon: ``There are zillions of
facts. ... The question is, having all those facts, what do you
conclude?
   ``If you ask me what a reduction in capital gains taxation would
do to federal revenues, I can get you two highly quantitative
reports, full of numbers, one saying it will go up and one saying
it will go down. Sometimes the `facts' come from people who want
them to be true.''
   As long ago as 1931, Charles Evans Hughes, then chief justice,
reflected in a speech on the potency of facts.
   Said Hughes: ``An unscrupulous administrator might be tempted to
say, `Let me find the facts for the people of my country, and I
care little who lays down the general principles.'''
   Says Jim Jaffe, a savvy aide on Capitol Hill since 1976: ``Look
at what's happening behind what we used to call the Iron Curtain.
You can say one of two things. You can say the Reagan plan of
spending like a madman, figure they'd run out of money before we
would, has been wildly successful. Or you can say the communist
world was deteriorating anyhow and look at all the domestic
concerns we ignored while we were wasting all this money on
missiles we had no need for. ... It's an intellectual game, it's
not a factual game.''
   There are lots of facts in Washington, but judgment is always
scarce. That's a fact.

<HEAD>Customs Takes $22 Million in Cash From Money Launderers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Agents stacked cash 3 feet high atop a 60-foot
banquet table and along the floor in announcing the seizure of
$22.07 million from drug dealers who thought they were turning
their profits over to money launderers.
   The dealers actually were giving their money to undercover
agents taking part in a 13-month sting, Customs Commissioner Carol
Hallett said Monday.
   A dozen agents wearing bulletproof vests and carrying machine
guns stood watch as Hallett spoke with more than $18 million
stacked on tables at the Doral Country Club and in boxes on the
floor. The rest of the money is in New York.
   ``This was a money-laundering operation of unprecedented
proportions,'' Ms. Hallett said. ``And this record seizure should
warn the drug smuggler that as each day passes, we're getting
closer and closer to them and their drug money.''
   Only one person, a driver, has been arrested.
   Hallet refused to disclose whether the sting was aimed at
Colombia's cocaine cartels, saying more arrests are expected. But
she said the drug ring involved Colombians and Cuban-Americans
working out of Miami, with connections in New York.
   A bank gave the original tip that the traffickers wanted to ship
the money to banks in the Caribbean and in Europe, authorities
said. Thirty-five undercover Customs agents stepped in.
   The dealers collected money from street drug sales, she said,
then gave it to couriers.
   The agents received the money from the couriers, who left
cash-stuffed cars at pre-arranged spots, such as shopping centers,
for pickup. The money, much of it in small bills, was so heavy cars
had to be equipped with special pneumatic shocks.
   The cash, containing large numbers of $20, $10 and $5 bills,
weighed more than 1{ tons, Ms. Hallett said.
   Guillermo Felix Hernandez-Castillo was arrested Thursday after
being stopped here with $421,000 in his car, authorities said. He
was jailed on $50,000 bail and must prove the money he posts as
bail is not drug-related.
   The $22 million seizure was a Customs record, but in a four-year
Drug Enforcement Administration money-laundering probe that ended
last year, agents seized $80.9 million in cash, said Miami DEA
spokesmn John Fernandes.
   The largest one-day seizure of cash was $19.6 million
confiscated in January 1989 by the DEA from New York dealers
connected to Colombia's Cali drug cartel.

<HEAD>Patch of Farmland to Join Antietam National Battlefield</HEAD>

   The Cornfield is partly a barley field now and
there aren't any trees in the North Woods, but both are becoming
federal property more than a century and a quarter after the Blue
and the Grey fought fiercely for them in the Battle of Antietam.
   The Richard King Mellon Foundation and the Conservation Fund
deeded 148 acres of Maryland farmland, including the two Civil War
sites, to the Interior Department on Monday as part of what was
billed as the largest-ever land donation to the government.
   The farm near Antietam Creek is one of 10 properties that the
Pittsburgh-based foundation has purchased at a cost of more than
$21 million for donation to the government by way of the
Conservation Fund, a land and water conservation organization.
   Also handed over on Monday were 93,000 acres of wildlife habitat
in North Carolina. The tract between Albemarle and Pamlico sounds
will be administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Gifts scheduled for transfer later in the year are:
   Five Forks at Dinwiddie, Va., site of a battle known as the
Waterloo of the Confederacy; Forked Lightning Ranch, N.M.,
surrounding the Pecos National Monument; 130 acres of upland
adjoining the marshes and open water of Mackay Island National
Wildlife Refuge, N.C.; a 122-acre addition to the Rachel Carson
National Wildlife Refuge, Maine.
   Also, two tracts totaling 468 acres to be added to Rocky
Mountain National Park, Colo.; two parcels of land on and near
Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park, Va.; and a 135-acre
addition to the Wilderness Area of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania
Memorial National Military Park, Va.
   The Antietam farm contained a 30-acre cornfield when the Battle
of Antietam, the bloodiest single day of fighting in American
history, was fought on Sept. 17, 1862. Of the 23,000 killed and
wounded, 55 percent were struck in and around the Cornfield, as the
site became known.
   Some were buried there, said Edwin C. Bearss, chief historian of
the National Park Service. From 1865 to 1867, the dead were removed
to a Union cemetery in Sharpsburg, Md., and to Confederate burial
places in Shepherdstown, W.Va., and Hagerstown, Md.
   The foundation bought the property from Paul Culler, who, with
his son Lynn, has farmed it for 37 years. They plant it in corn
some years and in barley, oats and hay at other times, in
accordance with modern crop rotation. This year, said Lynn Culler,
they have 18 acres in corn and the rest in barley.
   Richard Rambur, superintendent of Antietam National Battlefield
in Sharpsburg, said the Cornfield would be returned to its original
size and configuration on the basis of contemporary maps. He said
trees would be planted in the woods from which Union troops
advanced into the field.
   The Cullers will continue to farm the property for three or four
years under a lease arrangement with the Park Service, as
guaranteed by their arrangement with the Conservation Fund, Rambur
said. After that, it will be put up for lease by the highest
bidder, like other farmland in national parks.
   The farm includes not only the Cornfield, but most of the North
Woods, the wood lot from which Union troops advanced into the tall
corn. There are no trees in the North Woods now, and Rambur said
trees will be planted to make it the way it was in 1862.
   In addition to the farm, the foundation bought two other pieces
of property, outside the park boundary, that will be held for
possible donation later. Altogether, the 280 acres of land sold for
$1.1 million, Conservation Fund spokesman Jack Lynn said.

<HEAD>Economists See Fed Leaning Toward Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policymakers meeting today are
probably tilting toward nudging interest rates lower this summer,
many economists predict.
   The move, if it comes, would occur at an ideal time for
President Bush. He is looking for a rate cut and renewed economic
growth as a reward for abandoning his ``no new taxes'' pledge and
reaching out to Democrats for a deficit-reduction pact.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which began its closed-door,
two-day, mid-year policy review on Monday, likely will decide to
cut rates in coming weeks as signs of economic softness emerge,
analysts said. It may even decide to push rates down immediately by
a quarter of a percentage point.
   Although many economists believe the administration has a good
chance of getting what it wants, they say it will not be because of
the political pressure Bush and other top officials have been
trying to apply.
   ``The Fed never wants to be seen as caving in to politics, but
my feeling is for separate reasons ... they're going to move,''
said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York
government securities dealer.
   ``The economy is in danger of slipping into a recession by the
end of the year and I think the Fed will recognize it at this
meeting,'' he said.
   Minutes of the meeting will be made public in six weeks.
   Evidence of economic sluggishness is much more pronounced since
the Open Market Committee's last meeting May 15, Jones said.
   Until recently, the softness seemed to be confined to just a few
sectors of the economy, such as automobiles and construction. Now,
consumers _ who represent two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity _ are pulling back.
   Retail sales fell from March through May, the first triple
decline since the 1982 recession.
   The economy has virtually stopped producing new jobs. Excluding
the temporary hiring of census workers, the economy created only
105,000 jobs from March through May _ scarcely more than one-tenth
the rate of a few years ago.
   Adding to the pressure for lower rates are reports of a credit
crunch _ not from monetary policy, but from bank examiners.
Business people are complaining that loans are harder to get
because examiners, spooked by the S&amp;L crisis, are forcing banks to
be more careful.
   Although many economists predict a series of interest rate cuts
through the summer, others argue that the persistence of inflation
will prevent the Fed from acting precipitously.
   Excluding volatile food and energy prices, consumer inflation
was 4.8 percent in the 12 months ended in May, compared with 4.6
percent in the preceding 12-month period.
   ``It's going to be a tough call. I think they may end up having
a conditional directive ... which says if the unemployment rate
rises, the Fed should ease,'' said economist Paul Boltz of T. Rowe

   Pointing to a map of Lebanon's
coast, the captain of the Israeli patrol boat Dvora says the
possibility of a Palestinian guerrilla attack has seldom been
greater.
   ``In the eight years I have been on these boats, I don't
remember a time when there was such certainty in the air that
something was going to happen,'' said Capt. Chen.
   He spoke as the 69-foot craft sliced through the waters a few
hundred yards off the south Lebanon coast, sweeping the coastline
with radar and occasionally stabbing through the darkness with a
powerful searchlight.
   The tension felt by Chen and his eight-member crew is reflected
throughout Israel at a time when efforts to arrange
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are at a standstill.
   Palestinian guerrillas, including hard-liners who oppose PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat's diplomatic initiative, have mounted two
recent seaborne raids, using speedboats for the first time and
finding a chink in Israel's armor.
   On the Jewish holiday of Shavuot on May 30, boats with heavily
armed Palestinians from Abul Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front were
launched from a mother ship that had set sail from Libya.
   One outran Israeli defenders and reached the shore near a
crowded beach resort before four Arabs were killed and seven
captured. The attack prompted the United States to suspend its
political dialogue with the PLO.
   On June 23, Chen's Dvora _ Bee in Hebrew _ ran down a speedboat
heading toward the Israeli border settlement of Rosh Haniqra and
killed two guerrillas armed with rocket-propelled grenades and
automatic rifles. Responsibility was claimed by a fundamentalist
faction of Lebanese Sunni Moslems, traditional allies of the PLO.
   Ariel Merari, a terror expert at Tel Aviv University, says a
successful raid could set off a chain reaction that could end in a
new Middle East war. He notes that terror raids were a contributing
factor to the 1956, 1967 and 1982 wars between Israel and its Arab
neighbors.
   ``A single dramatic terror attack or series of smaller ones
change the atmosphere and trigger a war,'' he said.
   For example, he said, if Abul Abbas' heavily armed guerrillas
had slain Israelis on beaches and in hotels as reportedly planned
``the public outcry in Israel would have made it necessary for the
government to carry out a spectacular retaliatory strike ... I
presume against Libya.''
   That in turn could have prompted Iraq's Saddam Hussein to make
good on pledges to help Arab states attacked by Israel.
   At night along the rocky coast of south Lebanon, the defense
against guerrilla raids seems fragile indeed.
   The Israeli craft, based on a U.S. patrol boat designed for
Vietnam's Mekong River, seems to have little more firepower and
speed than most of its guerrilla adversaries.
   Its weaponry consists mainly of World War II-era 20mm cannons
and light machine guns plus some rocket-fired munitions. Its top
speed is about 40 knots.
   ``It's like soccer. We can't let them get past us and head for
the goal,'' explained Chen, who spent much of a recent night
hunched over, trying to sort out suspect ships from birds, waves
and friendlies on a plate-sized radar screen swarming with a
Rorschach of dots.
   Chen, whose full name could not be used in keeping with military
regulations, was surrounded by a bank of squawking radios linking
him to other Israeli patrol craft as well as radar and other shore
installations.
   Overriding everything, however, is the driving beat of ``Won't
Back Down,'' a Tom Petty song being played by Israel's armed forces
radio.
   The crew breaks the boredom by microwaving a series of snacks
including pizza and a soybean chicken substitute made in a factory
on Chen's kibbutz in northern Israel.
   About 3:30 a.m., a bell sounds for battle stations and the crew
scrambles from the air-conditioned bunk-rooms to the slippery decks
of the lurching and rolling Dvora.
   Moments later they stand down. ``It was just a flock of birds,''
said Eldad, a crew member who was steering the craft on the exposed
fly bridge within rifle range of the coast.
   The jumpiness is both an outgrowth of the proximity to Israel's
border and the variety of threats the guerrillas pose.
   Chen said guerrillas have tried to sneak past Israeli defenses
by sending lone frogmen underwater or rubber dinghies that hug the
shore line and are difficult to see with nightvision scopes and
radar. They have also planted mines or tried suicide attacks.
   ``The political situation is such that the Palestinians are
returning to the use of arms. They are trying from the shore, from
the sea and from the air,'' he said.

<HEAD>Allowing Rest Improves Pilot Performance, Study Says</HEAD>

   If pilots on long-haul flights are allowed to
take a brief snooze in the cockpit, they're more alert for the
landing, a federal study concludes.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration study of 10
Boeing 747 crews produced the first scientific evidence that short
rest periods act as a ``safety valve'' to reduce fatigue and
improve alertness during the most critical stage of a long flight,
investigators said Monday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration, which cosponsored the
study, is reviewing the results, officials said. Currently, only
military transport crews are allowed regular rest periods during
flights. Some airlines in other countries also have adopted the
practice, investigators said.
   The volunteer crews on Northwest and United flights across the
Pacific were divided into a rest group and a non-rest group, with
two NASA investigators monitoring each crew on the flight deck.
   ``The researchers found that given the opportunity to rest in
their seats, the pilots generally were able to fall asleep easily
and sleep well,'' the report said. ``Later, these crew members
demonstrated significantly higher levels of vigilance than their
no-rest counterparts.''
   The report said the differences were especially dramatic near
the end of the cruise phase of the flights, just before the pilot
starts the descent for landing.
   Pilots who took the preplanned rests on four successive flights
also were less affected by having to make consecutive flights and
flying at night, the report said.
   Crew members who were allowed to rest each were given 40-minute
rest periods on a rotation basis, so two pilots were always
controlling the plane.
   Crew reaction was measured both by observations recorded in a
log book by the NASA investigators and by portable monitoring
equipment hooked to the pilot's wrist.
   Previous research has shown that repeated time zone crossings
often produce poor sleeping patterns, particularly on eastbound
flights when days are shortened.
   NASA and FAA studies also have found that pilots themselves
often cannot accurately predict their own sleepiness.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of well-wishers whooped and hollered
as a wagon train that covered 260 dusty miles over 30 days rolled
into town to celebrate the state's centennial.
   Spectators jammed streets and rooftops in this frontier town
founded by showman Buffalo Bill Cody to watch the 4-mile-long
procession of some 200 wagons and 1,600 riders on horseback Monday.
   Kayne Pyatt, the trail boss who oversaw the odyssey, compared
the journey to an ``Alice in Wonderland'' experience.
   ``It's sort of like I've lived a great childhood adventure, a
fantasy,'' she said, having braved wind, dust and thunderstorms,
righted wrecked wagons and even broken a few ribs. ``If I died
tomorrow, I'd be satisfied.''
   Organized as a tribute to Wyoming's birthday on July 10, the
wagon train left Fort Caspar June 2. It attracted Western
aficionados from throughout the country who joined at various parts
of the Bridger Trail, which was one of the splinters of the Oregon
Trail leading west from Missouri.
   Sen. Alan Simpson rode the last few miles.
   ``There'll be as many people saying they rode the Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train as said they saw Babe Ruth's last game at
Yankee Stadium _ about 7 million,'' said the Republican, who grew
up in Cody.
   The riders started the day Monday about 16 miles east of Cody.
They traveled alongside a highway, passing sugar beet and barley
fields, crossing the raging Shoshone River and encountering a
torrential downpour about a mile out.
   The sun broke through just as they reached the edge of town,
distant thunder and lightning adding to the drama. Horses reared
and bucked, riders waved and hollered and a few wagon passengers
played their fiddles to the crowd.
   ``Cody loves you!'' some spectators yelled. ``Happy birthday,
Wyoming!''
   On Monday's final leg, Simpson and his wife, Ann, were joined on
horseback by Gov. Mike Sullivan and his wife, Jane. Montana Gov.
Stan Stephens rode in a red surrey.
   ``I wouldn't have bet there were this many horses in this whole
United States,'' said lifelong Cody resident Frank McJunkin, 70, as
he watched the covered wagons and riders ramble by.

<HEAD>Crop Insurance Tied to Loans in Some Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least one of every six farmers who take out
federal crop insurance does so in order to get a loan to stay in
business, according to a recent survey by the Agriculture
Department.
   The survey also showed that crop insurance was more likely to be
a requirement if loans were sought from the Farm Credit System,
FCS, or the Farmers Home Administration, FmHA.
   Merritt Hughes of the department's Economic Research Service
said the findings were based on the annual Farm Cost and Returns
Survey for the 1988-89 crop year and a recent follow-up survey of
3,000 farms that focused on insurance.
   Writing in the July issue of Agriculture Outlook magazine,
Hughes said roughly half of the farms represented by the survey had
some form of debt and that 23 percent of the indebted farms carried
federal crop insurance in 1988-89.
   ``Commercial banks and the FCS have stated that they never
require crop insurance as a prerequisite for lending,'' the report
said. ``FmHA has required federal crop insurance participation for
some loan contracts in some years.''
   The latest survey questioned borrowers, rather than the lenders.
About 17 percent of all farm operators represented by the survey
who bought insurance did so because it was required by lenders.
   ``Considering just the three major lenders (FCS, FmHA and
commercial banks), almost 31 percent of their borrowers represented
by the survey who bought federal crop insurance said they did so
because of a requirement by their lender,'' the report said.
   The three institutions accounted for about 80 percent of the
nation's farm loan volume in 1988.
   Of the total number of borrowers who said they were required to
buy insurance, almost half were required to do so by banks. Roughly
one-third said they were required by FmHA, and one out of seven by
the FCS.

   Some consumer groups and others want the
Agriculture Department to disclose more test information about a
proposed new beef inspection plan before a scientific panel
completes its review.
   The Government Accountability Project, a leader in the
coalition's demands, said Monday it planned to file a lawsuit in
U.S. District Court here asking that the USDA data be released
under the Freedom of Information Act.
   At the heart of the controversy is the department's long-pending
plan for a ``streamlined inspection system'' for beef that has been
undergoing pilot tests in preparation for final review by the
National Academy of Sciences. The NAS was contracted by USDA for
$170,000 to review the proposal.
   The plan, called SIS-Beef, would require participating meat
plants to take greater responsibility for some of the chores
traditionally done by federal inspectors.
   Agency officials contend that the inspectors would then
concentrate more on checking for disease and other defects that can
affect meat in the consumer pipeline. Each participating plant
would have to submit a quality control plan in advance for USDA
approval.
   Critics claim that under the plan fewer inspectors would monitor
plants and that beef would be turned out under speeded-up,
slipshod, dirty conditions as a result of companies taking over
some of the duties previously performed by federal inspectors.
   Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project said the NAS
review should be delayed until the department releases more
information. GAP is a non-profit public interest group that
provides legal support for government whistle blowers.
   ``It's our contention that serious public health decisions
shouldn't be made on the basis of secret reports,'' Devine said in
a telephone interview. ``The reason these things aren't being
released is they couldn't withstand scrutiny.''
   But the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, which
oversees the program, said results at the pilot plants show the SIS
system ``compares favorably with the traditional system'' of
federal inspection.
   Spokesman Jim Greene said the agency denied the request by
Devine and others for more information on the ground that ``some of
it is proprietary'' and not allowed to be made public.
   ``Some of it has a direct bearing on the ongoing agency contract
with NAS, and release of that information to a third party would
interfere with the scientific process and possibly compromise the
results of that contract (with NAS), he said.

   The Agriculture Department is sending a team
of scientists to the Soviet Union this fall to help set up a
computer bank for Russian plants.
   Information about seeds and other plant reproductive material _
germplasm _ will be stored in a Soviet data base modeled after a
Germplasm Resources Information Network, called GRIN, developed by
the department's Agricultural Research Service.
   James H. Elgin Jr., the agency's national program leader for
forage and pasture crops, said Monday that GRIN stores more than
1.5 million entries on about 8,100 different plant species
worldwide. He will lead the USDA team to Leningrad in September.
   Elgin said the goal is to have the Soviet data base compatible
with the GRIN system, thus allowing both countries to have access
to each other's information.

<HEAD>Weak Opening for `Days of Thunder' Highlights Summer Movie
Doldrums</HEAD>

   The summer movie season is more than a month
old and still there is no sign of a runaway hit.
   The latest lackluster opening was delivered over the weekend by
the Tom Cruise race car film ``Days of Thunder.''
   The movie, which received mostly mixed and a few positive
reviews, finished atop the box-office charts, but earned only $15.5
million in its first three days, according to figures released
Monday by Entertainment Data Inc.
   Although it was one of the season's most heavily promoted
titles, it made about as much money in its debut as did this
summer's lightly regarded ``RoboCop 2'' and ``Bird on a Wire.''
   Falling out of first place after two weeks was ``Dick Tracy.''
The Warren Beatty project collected $10.1 million and has now made
$68.4 million.
   So far, no summer title has emerged as a smash to rival last
season's ``Batman,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' ``Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade'' or ``Back to the Future Part II.''
   A number of this summer's films _ including ``Gremlins 2'' and
the ``RoboCop'' sequel _ look like bombs.
   The true test for ``Days of Thunder'' comes over the next few
weeks, when the film's ``legs,'' or longevity, will be tested by
``Die Hard 2,'' ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' ``Ghost,''
``Presumed Innocent'' and ``Arachnophobia.''
   In third place, plunging 55 percent, was ``RoboCop 2'' with
ticket sales of $6.4 million. Fourth was Arnold Schwarzenegger's
``Total Recall,'' with $6 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Entertainment Data, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Days of Thunder,'' Paramount, $15.5 million, 2,307 screens,
$6,714 per screen, $21.5 million, one week.
   2. ``Dick Tracy,'' Disney, $10.1 million, 2,332 screens, $4,331
per screen, $68.4 million, three weeks.
   3. ``RoboCop 2,'' Orion, $6.4 million, 1,772 screens, $3,597 per
screen, $25.8 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Total Recall,'' Tri-Star, $6 million, 1,961 screens, $3,060
per screen, $91.5 million, five weeks.
   5. ``Another 48 HRS.,'' Paramount, $5.4 million, 2,063 screens,
$2,621 per screen, $59.2 million, four weeks.
   6. ``Ghost Dad,'' Universal, $4.8 million, 1,213 screens, $3,960
per screen, $4.8 million, one week.
   7. ``Gremlins 2,'' Warner Bros., $4.6 million, 2,137 screens,
$2,146 per screen, $29.4 million, three weeks.
   8. ``Betsy's Wedding,'' Disney, $3.2 million, 1,058 screens,
$3,069 per screen, $10.1 million, two weeks.
   9. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $3.1 million, 1,305 screens, $2,381
per screen, $149.1 million, 15 weeks.
   10. ``Back to the Future Part III,'' Universal, $2.9 million,
1,546 screens, $1,890 per screen, $68.9 million, six weeks.

   A few hours before the Moscow Bears played
the first football game involving a Soviet team on American soil,
coach John Ralston was still explaining to his players how to suit
up in full pads.
   ``Don't forget, you need your thigh pads, your knee pads and
your elbow pads. You don't want to land on that AstroTurf without
your elbow pads,'' Ralston told the 39 players on the Soviet
national champion team in a meeting before their exhibition game
Monday with the minor-league Tacoma Express.
   Ralston, speaking through an interpreter, didn't go over game
strategy or try to give them a fiery pep talk. The former Denver
Broncos head coach said he mainly wanted to ensure his players
finished the game intact _ especially his starting tight end, since
both backups had been held back in the Soviet Union by the KGB the
night before departure.
   The final score justified Ralston's limited expectations. The
Tacoma Express rolled over the Bears 61-0.
   For the past eight weeks, Ralston has been attempting to mold a
group of Soviet rugby players, shot-putters, javelin throwers and
decathletes into a professional football team.
   The starting quarterback first touched a football seven months
ago _ he's the veteran. Ralston's biggest player tips the scales at
250 pounds.
   ``We have one linebacker, tough little guy, but I don't think he
weighs 175 pounds,'' Ralston said.
   The team is playing four American exhibition games arranged by
the International Sports Connection, a sports promotion company
based in Gadsen, Ala. Besides Tacoma, the team is scheduled to play
in Fresno, Calif.; Oklahoma City and Macon, Ga., with a possible
match in Charlotte, N.C.
   American football is catching on fast in the Soviet Union, with
24 teams and more athletes from other sports interested in playing,
said International Sports Connection Vice President Kent Dunston.
   He said the tour was designed to expose the Soviet players to a
higher level of competition than they would see in their home
country or Europe.
   The players don't harbor any longshot dreams about rolling over
American teams.
   Starting quarterback Yuri Boldin, who hurled the javelin for
years before he touched a pigskin, said the Bears hoped only to
show they understand the game.
   ``The main thing is to show what we have been taught by Coach
Ralston, just to show that we will be able to play,'' he said
through an interpreter.
   Special teams player Vladimir Skordcov, whose broad shoulders,
bulging arms and severe crew cut might land him movie roles as a
Russian army commando when his playing days end, said the Soviets
would be easily overmatched by the Americans' size.
   But he wasn't afraid to find out how hard the Americans could
hit.
   ``So far we have seen them eating, but do not know how they can
play,'' he said.
   Team President Mikhail Zakharyan predicted it would take five or
six years for Soviet teams to be competitive with the American
minor leagues. And the National Football League?
   ``Maybe our children will be able to play NFL teams,'' he said
through an interpreter.
   Zakharyan thought the Bears would improve enough by next season
to beat some of the hundreds of teams in 14 European nations.
   The Moscow team lost a recent game to a French team by a score
of 67-0, Ralston said. They lost by more than 80 points to a West
Berlin team.
   Ralston, who coached some of the world's best football players
at Denver from 1972 to 1976, said the Soviet receivers still don't
catch the ball when it's thrown to them, and often the quarterback
can't get the ball to them.
   But they don't lack for enthusiasm, he said. ``And they do
everything through an interpreter.''

   Katharine Hepburn is auctioning off
one of her paintings to benefit a wildlife organization.
   It is the only painting she has ever offered for public sale or
view, said the Oscar-winning actress, who has been painting since
the 1930s.
   The 16-by-20-inch work is an impressionistic look at the Beverly
Hills valley, somewhat hidden by tall trees and framed by a white
rail fence.
   ``I do hope it will bring a price, although I wouldn't give you
a nickel for it,'' joked the lifelong summer resident of this
shoreline community.
   Hepburn painted the work while staying at actor John Barrymore's
California home. She guessed she completed it in the 1960s.
   The painting will be among works of art to be auctioned this
fall to benefit the North American Wildlife Association Inc., which
is seeking to buy the house that serves as its headquarters.

   Willie Nelson's not-quite-annual Fourth of
July ``picnic'' is on again this year.
   But organizers are promising a somewhat tamer event than past
concerts.
   ``We're all older, the performers are older. That's the
evolution of the picnic, placing it in 1990. But I hope it's not
too restrained,'' said organizer Tim O'Connor.
   ``The mellowness is there,'' said singer Steve Fromholz.
``Neither Willie nor I party as hard as we did 10 years ago, but I
believe the music has gotten better for all of us.''
   O'Connor predicted a crowd of 25,000 to 35,000 for this year's
picnic, which will be held in Austin's Zilker Park. Nelson lives
near Austin.
   The first Willie Nelson picnic was on July 4, 1973. Since then,
the concerts have been marked by memorable music. But they have
also drawn complaints about drinking and drugs, traffic jams and
nudity.
   The last picnic was held in 1987 near Dallas. Only about 8,400
people showed up for a concert planned for 80,000.

   Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber is ending his
six-year marriage to singer Sarah Brightman.
   Lloyd Webber, the 42-year-old composer of such hits as ``Phantom
of the Opera'' and ``Cats,'' issued a statement Monday saying he
had become ``close friends'' with another woman, Madeleine Gurdon.
   ``It is clear to me that, with the greatest sadness, I have to
face the fact that my marriage to Sarah Brightman is at an end,''
he said.
   It did not say whether they would divorce.
   Lloyd Webber met Miss Brightman nine years ago and cast her in
``Cats.'' They had no children. LLoyd Webber has two children by a
previous marriage.
   ``I am deeply saddened that our marriage should end like this,''
said Miss Brightman, 30. ``It is not something I either wish for or
have sought.''
   Miss Gurdon, a 27-year-old businesswoman, would not comment on
the announcement.

   Noel Blanc, who has taken over doing the

   Blanc said he did not have professional training until after his
father's near-fatal car accident in 1961.

   About 1,400 Moslem pilgrims
suffocated or were trampled to death Monday in a stampede in a
pedestrian tunnel leading to the holy city of Mecca, witnesses and
diplomats said.
   Almost a day after the disaster, which occurred during the
annual hajj pilgrimage, Saudi officials had still not given a death
count.
   King Fahd was quoted by the official Saudi news agency SPA as
saying that the accident occurred because a large number of
pilgrims thronged the tunnel beyond capacity.
   ``If the hajis had followed the instructions, the accident would
have been averted,'' he was quoted as saying. ``One reason why the
number (of casualties) was so big is the fact that it is the first
big accident of its kind. Caution cannot preclude fate.''
   Witnesses and diplomats said the stampede began Monday morning
when some pilgrims stopped in the middle of the air-conditioned
tunnel and there was a rush outside with people pushing each other
to escape the 112-degree heat. They also said the ventilation
appeared to have stopped.
   One Asian diplomat who refused to be identified put the death
toll at 1,400 and said many of the victims were Indonesian and
Malaysian pilgrims. Four Middle Eastern diplomats as well as
witnesses gave the same death toll.
   The stampede shattered what had been a peaceful observance of
the hajj, or pilgrimage, and was the worst pilgrimage tragedy in
recent years. In previous years, terrorist attacks and riots marred
the celebration.
   It came at the end of the Moslem holiday Eid Al-Adha, or the
Feast of Sacrifice, for which 2 million Moslems, including 800,000
foreigners, came to the holy city of Mecca.
   Ambulances and security forces rushed to the exits of the
500-yard-long tunnel that joins Mecca and the tent city of Mina,
according to state-run Riyadh radio, which quoted an Interior
Ministry spokeman in Mina.
   Witnesses said people stampeded, crushing hundreds of people and
suffocating hundreds others.
   People were smothered ``as thousands of the pilgrims thronged
through the tunnel of Mo'essem, causing severe congestion within
the tunnel as the pressure was beyond its capacity,'' the radio
said. ``This led to some deaths and some cases of fainting.''
   A witness, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the flow of
people through the tunnel suddenly stopped. The air-conditioned
tunnel can hold up to 1,000 pedestrians, but the crowd inside
quickly swelled to 5,000, he said.
   ``With the lack of oxygen, a good number collapsed unconscious,
and some died. There was also a stampede,'' the witness said.
   ``There always should be movement within the tunnel, but the
entire crowd suddenly stopped, and no one yet knows why,'' he said.
   The witness said he helped carry victims to the ambulances
waiting by the tunnel's exits, but it was impossible to determine
how many people were dead or simply unconscious.
   The tunnel is part of massive $15 billion development plan for
the holy sites to move pilgrims in a more orderly fashion for the
hajj, the world's largest religious gathering. The plan includes
other tunnels and overhead bridges.
   The tent city was set up in Mina to house visiting pilgrims.
   About 2 million Moslems were at Islam's holy sites in the Mecca
area for the hajj. The celebration climaxed Sunday with prayers on
Mount Arafat, about eight miles from Mecca.
   At the time of the tunnel disaster Monday morning, the pilgrims
were taking part in post-hajj rituals or preparing to leave.
Thousands of the pilgrims left Mecca later Monday.
   These rituals of Eid Al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice,
commemorate the Prophet Abraham's offering of his son in sacrifice
to God.
   Moslems celebrate the feast by slaughtering sheep to emulate the
sacrifice of Abraham, who is also revered by Christians and Jews.
   The Moslem faith requires that each worshiper attempt to attend
the pilgrimage.
   Before Monday, only a small fire at Mina and a few cases of heat
fatigue marred an otherwise calm pilgrimage season.
   Terrorism blamed on Iranian or Shiite Moslems has occurred in
the past three years.
   The worst incident was in 1987, when Iranians clashed with
security forces, leading to the death of more than 400 pilgrims.
The year before, the Saudis confiscated large quantities of
explosives from members of the Iranian contingent.
   The Saudis have since set a quota of 1,000 per million of
population for each Islamic nation. Angered by the quotas, the
Iranians have boycotted the hajj since 1988.
   Last year, some small bombs went off during the hajj, killing
one pilgrim and injuring 16. The Saudis tried and convicted Kuwaiti
Shiite Moslems and beheaded 16 of them.

   Jurors unconvinced Imelda Marcos knew of her
husband's alleged corrupt practices cleared her of charges she
looted $222 million from the Philippines and hid the money by
sinking it into art and real estate.
   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi also was acquitted of helping
Mrs. Marcos and her husband conceal ownership of four New York
buildings.
   ``I am in great awe and respect for the jury system that
symbolizes the soul of the American people,'' the widow of former
Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos said after the verdict
Monday on her 61st birthday.
   ``This is the best birthday present I ever had,'' she said.
   The verdict reduced Mrs. Marcos to tears and elated supporters.
She went directly to St. Patrick's Cathedral, where she walked on
her knees down the aisle to the altar, then bowed her head to the
floor and prayed.
   Friends and supporters celebrated with her into the evening at
an apartment where she stayed during the trial. She later emerged,
reportedly headed for a party with Khashoggi as host. Asked about
her plans, she said, ``Home.''
   Philippines President Corazon Aquino expressed disappointment
over the acquittal and said the former first lady still was barred
from returning home for national security reasons.
   Philippine officials said they are ready to file charges against
Mrs. Marcos _ if the president lets her return. The constitution
bans criminal trials in absentia.
   Jurors, announcing their verdict on the fifth day of
deliberations after a three-month trial, told reporters they were
not convinced Mrs. Marcos knew of her husband's alleged wrongdoing
or the source of his wealth.
   The prosecution had argued that even though its evidence was
heavily circumstantial, it proved that Mrs. Marcos, as a cabinet
minister and mayor of Manila, knew the millions of dollars they
invested were accumulated illegally.
   ``Just because she was married to him doesn't make her guilty,''
said jury forewoman Catherine Balton.
   Juror Thomas O'Rourke said the case did not belong in the U.S.
courts.
   ``We are not big brothers to the people overseas,'' he said,
adding that the prosecution had relied on ``half-truths and not the
right witnesses.''
   ``For three years they have made this poor woman's life
miserable,'' he said. ``It may have been a conspiracy, but not a
conspiracy by Marcos.''
   In a statement, the office of U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier
praised the work of the prosecutors and said: ``The jury has
rendered its verdict. Our system of justice has spoken.''
   The prosecutor's office said an estimate of how much the case
cost the U.S. government was not available.
   The jury acquitted both defendants of all charges _
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction
of justice against Mrs. Marcos, and mail fraud and obstruction
against Khashoggi.
   Mrs. Marcos had faced up to 50 years in prison and $1 million in
fines. Khashoggi could have drawn 10 years and a $500,000 fine.
   Mrs. Marcos had been accused of conspiring with her husband to
buy art, jewelry and real estate with $222 million stolen from
their country's treasury.
   Witnesses testified the money was funneled to the United States
through bank accounts in Switzerland, Hong Kong, Manila and Los
Angeles and was used to secretly buy the buildings for the Marcoses.
   Marcos was indicted with his wife in 1988, 2{ years after he was
deposed in a popular uprising. The couple fled to exile in Hawaii,
where Marcos died in September.
   Marcos attorney Gerry Spence, a flashy Wyoming native who wore a
cowboy hat and boots to court, said in closing arguments that Mrs.
Marcos was a ``world-class shopper'' who was guilty only of loving
and supporting her husband.
   During the trial, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan called the
case unprecedented because it involved a former head of state who
was a major U.S. ally, and he wondered whether the case belonged in
a U.S. court.
   Testimony included accounts of Mrs. Marcos' shopping habits,
such as spending sprees at Bloomingdale's and numerous New York
jewelry stores.
   Khashoggi, 54, an arms dealer and jet-set financier once
described as the world's richest man, said of the verdict, ``I feel
very happy for myself and my family and for the United States.''

   Dimitrios I, the first Greek Orthodox
patriarch to visit the United States, says civilization is
threatened by a turn away from morality and spirituality.
   ``The world today, precisely because of technological
achievements and its material well-being, has immense problems of a
moral and spiritual nature,'' the leader of the Orthodox Church
said.
   ``These threaten to shatter the very structure of our
civilization and even the planet itself. This nation must lead a
moral and spiritual rebirth for the good of mankind.''
   The spiritual leader of 250 million Orthodox faithful, most of
them residents of the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, came to the
United States with an entourage of 14 on the ``Olympic Flame,'' a
plane put at his disposal by the Greek national airline.
   One of the objects of his trip is to promote a meeting in
Geneva, Switzerland, of all Orthodox leaders.
   A Turkish citizen, Dimitrios, 75, lives in Istanbul where
tradition holds that Orthodox Christianity was founded by St.
Andrew the Apostle nearly 2,000 years ago.
   He will spend most of this month in the United States, including
10 days in Washington. He will meet President Bush and leaders of
Congress.

   Two thirds of the nation's cities say they are
having a tougher time paying their bills than a year ago, and 54
percent say the crunch is so severe they expect spending to exceed
revenues in their current budget year, according to a survey.
   The National League of Cities survey of 576 communities said the
budget pressures are greatest in the Northeast _ where the regional
economy is slumping. Five of six cities and towns surveyed in that
region reported that their financial problems were worse than a
year ago.
   Leaders of the organization, whose membership is open to cities
and towns with populations of at least 10,000, said a major factor
in the growing municipal budget problems is the lack of help from
Washington.
   Forty-one percent of the municipalities surveyed have raised
local property taxes, and 76 percent increased fees and other
charges, the League of Cities said.

<HEAD>Government Strongly Warns Against Use of Aspirin By Pregnant Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is requiring
strengthened warnings against use of aspirin products by women in
the last three months of pregnancy.
   The agency said the stronger warning, being published today in
the Federal Register, is needed because aspirin can affect fetal
circulation and uterine contraction.
   Manufacturers have one year to add the stronger warning to all
oral and rectal over-the-counter products containing aspirin, the
FDA said.
   The warning must read:
   ``It is especially important not to use aspirin during the last
three months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by
a doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn child or
complications during delivery.''
   Aspirin products now carry a general warning that says:
   ``As with any drug, if you are pregnant or nursing a baby, seek
the advice of a health professional before using this product.''
   An advisory panel of medical experts had recommended the
stronger warning.
   A similar warning is already required on nonprescription
products containing the pain-reliever ibuprofen.

medical expenses.
   The new coverage took effect Sunday, allowing Medicare to help
pay the cost of Pap smear screenings once every three years or more
often if the patient is at high risk for developing cervical cancer.
   Previously, Medicare would paid for Pap smears only if the
patient were being treated for an existing gynecological cancer or

<HEAD>Council Recommends Truck Weight Policy To Save $4.3 Billion.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal research group is calling for a more
liberal policy on truck weights that it says could save $4.3
billion a year in transport costs and cost railroads $750 million
in lost revenue.
   The National Research Council committee said all states should
be given the option of exempting some trucks from a federal limit
of 80,000 pounds on the nation's interstate highways. It also
recommended changes in the rules for bridge use that would allow
heavier concrete mixers, dump trucks and other trucks with shorter
wheelbases.
   The weight exemptions would be on the condition that they
include fees to cover pavement and bridge wear, said the committee,
which is made up of transportation experts from universities, the
industry and government. The research council is linked to the
National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of
Engineering.
   The committee report recommends that heavy trucks still be
restricted to designated routes, comply with all other federal
weight restrictions and comply with strict safety standards.
   The exemptions would still be up to individual states, but the
report said it was not fair to prevent about half the states from
allowing exemptions while the others who had exemptions before the
current law can keep theirs.
   If all states adopted the exemptions, annual transportation
savings for truckers could total $1.9 billion because of the use of
more productive vehicles, the report said.

   East Germany's unemployment has jumped by 50
percent in the last month, East Germany's labor minister says.
   The minister, Regine Hildebrandt, said Monday that the latest
figures show 150,000 East Germans are out of work, compared to
100,000 jobless at the beginning of June. In mid-April, 45,000 of
East Germany's 8 million workers were unemployed.
   However, Ms. Hildebrandt said in an interview broadcast on West
Berlin's RIAS radio that 50,000 jobs were open.
   She blamed slow Western investment for the increase in
joblessness.
   Some economists have predicted up to 4 million East Germans will
lose their jobs as inefficient state-owned companies are forced to
lay off workers. One-third of all East German companies are not
expected to survive.

<DATELINE>SPICER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swallows' nests clogging a propane swimming
pool heater's ventilation ducts apparently caused a buildup of
carbon monoxide that sent 136 motel guests and rescue workers to
the hospital, authorities say.
   All those treated after Sunday's poisoning were released later
in the day.
   The Cazador Inn reopened Monday after tests showed no traces of
the fumes, said Sharon Smith, Kandiyohi County environmental health
inspector.
   Inspectors found that the buildup of the fumes, which can be
fatal, resulted from poor ventilation at the two-story, 33-room
motel.
   In the swimming pool area, investigators found some of the
ventilation ducts plugged with swallows' nests, said Fire Chief
Tony Rime. The obstructions caused fumes to spread down the halls
and into guest rooms, he said.
   The motel was evacuated after guests began complaining of
illness. Some guests were found passed out. Dozens were treated
initially on the motel lawn.
   Up to 30 people had symptoms usually associated with carbon
monoxide poisoning, which include grogginess, headaches and nausea.
   Almost everyone at the motel was taken to the hospital, even
those with no symptoms.
   ``It was kind of like being drunk,'' said a guest, Chad Schuler
of Granite Falls.
   Smith said she has inspected the pool area, including the
propane heater, annually since 1987, when the county began routine
inspections. She last inspected the pool area Nov. 15 and gave the
heater a clean bill of health.
   Smith said she could not recall any problems with the system in
previous inspections but said she usually does not inspect the
ducts.
   Bob James, code specialist with the state fire marshal, said
blockage is not uncommon for indoor pool heaters. He said heaters
that are used year-around, as is the one at the motel, probably
should be inspected twice a year.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big Bird was there, and Fozzie Bear, and Oscar the
Grouch, as more than 1,400 colleagues, family and fans paid tribute
to Muppet creator Jim Henson in a verdant St. Paul's Cathedral.
   England was a second home to Henson, who died in May at the age
of 53.
   ``He loved England and the English; we claim him as ours,'' said
Duncan Kenworthy, chief of Henson Productions in Britain.
   For the tribute, the cathedral was transformed to resemble a
north London parkland Henson loved. The 17th-century building was
festooned with greenery, its aisles full of Henson's creatures and
portraits of their creator.
   Friends and colleagues of Henson had worked into the night
adorning the cathedral with garlands, plants and birches.
   A May 21 memorial for Henson at the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine in New York included a Dixieland band and Muppets singing
their way through the crowd. Henson died May 16 in New York of
pneumonia.
   Henson's family asked well-wishers not to wear black, saying the
event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for Henson's
life as a traditional memorial service.
   ``He has left a heritage that will never be forgotten. Jim
Henson will always be with us,'' said Lord Lew Grade.
   It was Grade who contracted Henson in 1976 to make 24 half-hour
episodes of ``The Muppet Show'' after the Muppeteer failed to find
American backing for the variety show.
   The show became one of the most widely seen television programs
in the world, with an estimated 235 million viewers in 100
countries.
   Most of Henson's films were made in Britain as well.
   Henson owned a home in north London's leafy Hampstead district,
across the street from the onetime Victorian post office housing
the Creature Shop where his puppets are made.
   Muppet performer Richard Hunt led a quartet in a medley of
Henson's favorite songs.
   Henson's wife Jane and four of his five children attended.
   ```When I was young, my ambition was to be one of the people who
makes a difference in this world,''' daughter Cheryl, 29, recited
from an essay written by her father. ```My hope still is to leave
this world a little bit better than it was when I got here.'''
   ``We really feel he did leave the world a bit better,'' she told
the congregation. ``So, thanks.''

<TEXT>
   Stunt fliers and air show enthusiasts doubt
the deaths of six stunt pilots in the past month are related but
say the industry should take another look at how it operates.
   ``If there is something that's a common denominator, we've got
to find it,'' said Rick Nadeau, executive director of the
International Council of Air Shows, based in Michigan.
   People in the industry said Monday that the crashes, which are
under investigation, apparently are unrelated because they involved
different aircraft, locations and flying conditions.
   A Vietnam veteran flying loops in a World War II training plane
slammed into the Niagara River near Buffalo on Sunday. A crash in
Ottawa the same day also involved a stunt plane dating to World War
II. On Saturday, a man died when his biplane crashed during a stunt
takeoff.
   Three more stunt pilots died at air shows in crashes in Oklahoma
City, Abilene, Texas, and Zeeland, Mich.
   Stunt flier Tom Poberezny, president of the Experimental
Aircraft Association, said the accidents seem unconnected. But he
added, ``We wouldn't want to be so flippant as to say it's just
luck.''
   Poberezny said it is important that the crashes are thoroughly
studied ``to make sure there's no underlying cause as to why they
happened.''
   A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said it is
too early to draw conclusions, but there is ``no reason to suspect
the regulations are at fault or anything else is at fault'' in the
crashes.
   ``If there's a common thread in these accidents,'' said
spokesman Dick Stafford, ``you can bet the FAA will do something
about it.''
   Stafford said FAA regulations deal with the pilot, the plane,
the stunts and the proximity of spectators. No spectators were hurt
in any of the crashes.

<HEAD>City, Homeless Reach Agreement in Hotel Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Homeless people who seized an abandoned hotel two
weeks ago agreed to leave today after Mayor Maynard Jackson
promised to build thousands of single-room apartments for the
homeless by 1994.
   Jackson and homeless leader Bill Jones announced their agreement
Monday night after hours of negotiations, bringing cheers from
about 50 of the street people who have been living in the
ramshackle Imperial Hotel.
   The city had set a midnight deadline for an end to the
occupation.
   The mayor promised the city will build 3,500 units of
single-room occupancy housing over the next 3{ years.
   In return, the squatters said they would leave the Imperial
today and move to a 200-bed shelter opened Monday. The city said
the shelter would have more lenient rules about entering and
leaving than most other city shelters.
   On Monday, Jackson's administration rushed two proposals before
the City Council that would provide $638,000 to build or renovate
nearly 300 units of SRO housing.
   The mayor offered no cost estimate for the overall plan or
indication of where the 3,500 units of housing might be built.
   ``The point is we've got a problem here and Atlanta is in the
forefront of trying to solve it,'' Jackson said.
   The agreement averted a confrontation between the homeless and
police. It also avoided the possibility of a demonstration by the
squatters as the Independence Day parade passes the Imperial on
Wednesday.
   Eight demonstrators took over the hotel June 18, protesting the
lack of apartments and the closing of several shelters for summer.
They renamed the hotel Welcome House and began cleaning it up,
welcoming other homeless people.
   The squatters had refused to move to shelters until they had a

   ``It's been a crisis for a long time, but their demonstration
has made us sit up and take notice,'' said Shirley Franklin, the
city's chief negotiator, who spent a night with the squatters.
   Jones said the takeover has done more in two weeks for the
homeless than ``committees have done in seven years.''
   Atlanta has 10,000 homeless people, according to the Task Force
for the Homeless.

   Even though the film trade considered the
opening weekend receipts for ``Days of Thunder'' less than
thundering, Tom Cruise says he's happy with the results.
   ``You can `buy' yourself an opening by putting your picture in
3,500 theaters and spending a lot of money. The important thing is
to have `legs,''' the star of the racing movie said, using the
industry term for staying power.
   ``Days of Thunder'' finished atop the box-office charts but
grossed just $15.5 million, a weaker opening than ``Dick Tracy,''
``Total Recall,'' ``Another 48 HRS.,'' ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' and ``Back to the Future Part III.''
   The figures released Monday by Entertainment Data Inc. showed
the $55 million movie could be headed for trouble. The lightly
regarded ``RoboCop 2,'' by comparison, grossed $14.1 million in its
first weekend.
   ``The exit polls for `Days of Thunder' have been fantastic,''
Cruise countered in a telephone interview Monday. ``I'm very happy
with the reaction to the film when I've seen it in theaters. It
plays well with an audience. They laugh in certain areas that I
don't expect.''
   He said the mixed-to-tepid reviews didn't bother him either.
   ``I don't read reviews, even the good ones,'' he declared.
``They don't affect me or the film. A lot of filmmakers whom I
respect have called me to say how much they liked the movie.
   ``They were actually surprised,'' he said, laughing heartily.
   A stock car racer himself, Cruise formulated a story four years
ago, and Robert Towne turned it into a script.
   ``I studied all the past race movies I could find,'' said the
actor. ``I found different things in each of them but none of them
took the spirit of the driver and developed it. That's what we
tried to do.
   ``The important thing is to stretch the genre. Even my entrance
is set up as a `wink,' like the arrival of the hero in a Western.''
   Cruise said he has no new project and is looking at a lot of
scripts. He added ruefully, ``Putting together a film today is like
assembling a Super Bowl team.''

<HEAD>Moslem Hajj Is World's Largest Religious Gathering</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Mecca-Deaths, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Each year, hundreds of thousands of Moslems from around the
world travel to the holy city of Mecca by land, sea or even on foot
for the annual pilgrimage known as the hajj. It is the world's
largest religious gathering.
   The pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines in Saudi Arabia brings
together Arabian princes, merchants from Indonesia, peasants from
Soviet Uzbekistan, and paupers from Bangladesh.
   The hajj must be made at least once in a lifetime by all Moslems
who can afford it. A Moslem who performs the pilgrimage is called a
hajji.
   During the hajj, pilgrims must abstain from sex and may not
quarrel, cut their hair, or even kill a fly.
   Hajjis start the pilgrimage by praying at the Grand Mosque in
Mecca. They then circle seven times around the Kaaba, a granite
cube draped with gold-embroidered black brocade. Moslems honor the
Kaaba as the house of Allah, where the Prophet Abraham offered his
first prayers to God.
   Hajjis are then required to run back and forth seven times
between two rocks about half-a-mile apart, called al-Safa and
al-Marwa. This ceremony is meant to relive the agony of Hagar,
Abraham's second wife, when she was looking for water for her son
Ishmael, considered the ancestor of the Arabs.
   The main center of the pilgrimage then moves to Mina, a meeting
place for the hajjis to gather before they climb Mount Arafat for
the climax of the observances. Moslems believe Arafat is where
Abraham showed his devotion to God by offering to sacrifice his son.
   At Mount Arafat, each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the
three ``devil pillars,'' a spot where Moslems believe the devil
tried to tempt Abraham to disobey Allah and refuse to sacrifice his
son. At twilight, pilgrims offer the Eid Al-Adha, or Feast of
Sacrifice, prayers before slaughtering hundreds of thousands of
sheep, cows and camels.
   Over the years, the hajj has been beset by tragedy.
   In 1979, religious extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca
and held it for two weeks before Saudi forces stormed it. More than
250 people were killed and Saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more.
   In 1987, clashes with Saudi security forces in Mecca killed 402
people during the hajj, 275 of them Iranians. It was the most
serious of a series of incidents during pilgrimages since Iran's
1979 Islamic revolution.
   After that carnage, Saudi Arabia restricted the number of
pilgrims and later broke off diplomatic ties with Iran.
   The incidents were fired by Iranian efforts to politicize the
hajj and encourage other Moslem nations to seize shrines at Mecca
and Medina from the control of the kingdom's Saud royal family.
   Iran denied in September 1989 that it was involved in two bomb
blasts in Mecca two months earlier, and Tehran-supported terrorists
vowed to avenge Saudi Arabia's execution of 16 Shiite Moslems
convicted of setting the explosions.
   The bombs exploded as thousands of people took part in the hajj,
killing one person and injuring 16.
   The attacks were believed connected to the centuries-old feud
between Sunni and Shiite Moslems. The Saudi royal family is Sunni,
while Shiites are an overwhelming majority among Iran's nearly 50
million people.
   Last year, an estimated 1.8 million Moslems from more than 80
nations went on the annual pilgrimage. An estimated 2 million
people attended this year.

   Scott Heimdal got a hero's welcome in his
hometown from friends and strangers who helped raise the $60,000
ransom his South American kidnappers demanded for the release of
the American gold miner.
   ``It's a great feeling'' to be home, said Heimdal, 27, upon
arriving in this western Illinois city. Except for a celebration
Saturday, Heimdal said his only plans for this week were to ``take
it easy.''
   Wearing an ``I Love Peoria'' T-shirt, Heimdal stepped off a
plane late Monday with his mother, Marge, who had flown to Ecuador
June 18 to negotiate his release after the Colombian guerrillas
refused to free him even though they had been given the money.
   Heimdal had been working as a miner in Ecuador when he was
kidnapped April 28 near the Colombian border.
   His family raised $60,000 in four days of public appeals. Bars
and banks took up collections, children sold lemonade and nursing
homes held bake sales.
   Heimdal said he intends to return to Ecuador. ``It's really a
wonderful country,'' he said.
   Earlier Monday during a stopover in Miami, he identified his
captors as members of the communist People's Liberation Army. He
said they treated him with ``great respect'' and wished him ``good
luck'' on his release.
   TV camera lights, reporters' questions and a jubilant crowd of
about 100 well-wishers deluged the Heimdals as they entered Peoria
airport.
   ``This has been the longest day of our lives,'' said Linda
Heimdal, one of his sisters.
   Heimdal received a bouquet of roses from Trudy Maloof, wife of
the town's mayor, a family friend. Outside, a blue van was
decorated with balloons and a sign saying, ``Welcome home Scott and
Marge.''
   Those welcoming Heimdal included Ruby Culess, who said she
didn't know the family but had prayed for his release. She carried
a sign that read, ``God hears our prayers.''
   ``We don't know the family, but it's wonderful that's he's
coming home,'' said Jo Frederick.
   In Miami, Heimdal recounted his kidnapping, which took place
while he was returning to the Ecuadoran capital of Quito.
   ``We were going down river in a 30-foot Indian dugout canoe when
three men attacked us. They killed the driver, wounded the other
guy and took me hostage. They were looking to kidnap a North
American,'' he said.
   Heimdal said that he initially feared for his life but that his
captors treated him well. He said he was often moved about and was
guarded by up to 25 guerrillas. The group kidnapped him to finance
its war with the government of Colombia.
   Originally his captors wanted far more money for his release,
but Heimdal said he convinced them his parents could not afford it.
   ``In Latin America there is a misconception that being from
North America means being rich,'' he said.
   Heimdal said his father, Roy, stayed in Quito to withdraw the
remainder of the family's money from a bank there and to bring his
son's fiancee, Sandra Durango, to the United States.
   Mrs. Heimdal said she did not know exactly how much was raised
for her son's release but that any money that might be left would
go to charity.
   ``Everybody's been so supportive _ even strangers, people who
don't know the family,'' Heimdal said. ``I owe a debt I probably
will never be able to repay.''

   Most of the nation enjoyed fair weather early today, while
thunderstorms developed over North Dakota.
   Sunshine was predicted over most of the nation today, with a mix
of showers and thunderstorms expected in Minnesota and Wisconsin.
Thunderstorms also were forecast for Arizona and New Mexico.
   Temperatures were in the 70s and low 80s early today throughout
much of the Plains, where hours earlier scorching heat set records
for the date Monday in 18 cities. Valentine, Neb., the hottest spot
in nation Monday, had an all-time high of 114. Readings soared
above 100 in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska, South
Dakota, Wyoming and Montana.
   In Colorado, the high of 101 degrees Monday at Grand Junction
marked a record 10 straight days of 100-degree heat.
   Thunderstorms helped break up the heat wave in the Plains, but
brought with them hail and high winds. In Montana, winds gusted to
60 mph and golf ball-size hail fell at Great Falls. More than 2{
inches of rain fell in less than two hours at Westby. Golf
ball-size hail also fell west of Kenaston, N.D.
   Thunderstorms developing along and ahead of a cold front
extended from Mississippi to Florida Monday evening. Winds gusted
to 70 mph at Birmingham, Ala., and dime-size hail and 2\ inches of
rail fell in Jacksonville, Fla. Showers and thunderstorms also
developed over New Mexico and Arizona and the Pacific Northwest.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.
   Thunderstorms kept temperatures in the 70s and 80s in some parts
of the Southeast on Monday. Miami equaled its record low for the
date of 71 degrees in the midst of an afternoon thunderstorm. High
temperatures were only in the 60s along the central Pacific Coast
but climbed well above 100 in the desert Southwest.

<TEXT>
   The fall and winter brought East
Germany's revolution. Summer saw the economic merger of the two
Germanys. Now, people are predicting a ``hot autumn'' as the two
states stride toward political unity.
   So far, the moves toward unification have been charged with
symbolism _ the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the establishment
of a single currency, the elimination of internal border controls.
   The next stage looks to be more prosaic: long and difficult
negotiations toward the political treaty that will iron out
constitutional and legal obstacles to unification.
   Government negotiators hope to be able to present a unity treaty
to their respective parliaments in September.
   On Monday night, the East German government called for joint
elections in both countries on Dec. 2, one of two December dates
proposed by the Bonn government.
   Guenther Krause, a leader of East Germany's dominant Christian
Democratic Union, said the East German proposal also calls for
state elections in East Germany on Oct. 14.
   Officials in Bonn have said they want to change only those parts
of the West German Constitution absolutely necessary for
unification.
   But one of the biggest legal differences between the two
Germanys _ their opposing abortion laws _ will probably be left
unresolved before unification.
   In West Germany, a woman must prove medical or financial
necessity to have an abortion. In East Germany, abortions on demand
are legal in the first trimester.
   A West German government spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the differing laws would probably continue for a
transitional period, meaning West German women could travel East
for abortions.
   Another point of contention is what city _ Berlin or Bonn _ will
be the capital of a united Germany.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere has said he wants
Berlin stipulated as the capital in the final unification treaty,
but politicians in the West have balked, and Kohl's government has
said the decision must come from a united German parliament.
   How to conduct all-German elections for a united parliament has
also become a point of debate.
   West German law requires political parties to have a minimum 5
percent election showing for representation in parliament. There is
no such minimum in East Germany, and politicians there have said it
would be unfair to require East German parties to attain 5 percent
of the vote in a united Germany.
   As a compromise, West German Interior Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble has suggested that the balloting be conducted separately
in East and West Germany.
   Domestic financial issues also need resolving.
   East German Finance Minister Walter Romberg has demanded
negotiations to include East Germany in a West German financial
program that redistributes funds from rich areas to poorer ones.
   But according to a West German draft of the unity treaty, the
five new states in what is now East Germany would not be eligible
for such revenue-sharing until after 1994.
   The $70 billion German Unity Fund established to help with East
German reconstruction would be the sole source of financing until
then, the draft says.
   Unification is also contingent on international approval, but
that is expected to come in November at a meeting of the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Last week, West Germany addressed some of Moscow's concerns
about German unification by announcing that $780 million would go
to help finance the cost of the 380,000 Soviet troops in East
Germany for the second half of 1990.
   The status of Soviet troops in East Germany, the military
posture of a united Germany and the size of a combined German army
have been the Kremlin's main worries about a reunited Germany.
   The Soviets have opposed a united Germany's membership in NATO.
But Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to visit Moscow July 15-16 for
talks that are expected to focus on winning Soviet approval for
German NATO membership by providing Western aid to the moribund
Soviet economy.
   West Germany has already backed a $3 billion bank credit to the
Soviet Union and has been pressing the European Economic Community
to support an even larger aid package.

   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Clouds and
drizzle were reported on the lower slopes of the mountain.

   Anatoly Grishchenko, a Soviet helicopter pilot
who contracted leukemia after what was hailed as a heroic effort to
try to douse the fire at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, has died at
age 53.
   Grishchenko had been in critical condition with a lung infection
for more than two weeks at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
where he had received a bone-marrow transplant April 27 in an
attempt to conquer his leukemia.
   He died late Monday of cardiopulmonary failure, said spokeswoman
Susan Edmonds.
   Grishchenko in 1986 repeatedly flew his heavy-lift copter
through the intensely radioactive gases spewing from the Chernobyl
plant, dumping sand and cement in an overmatched effort to cap the
crippled reactor.
   He and a handful of others in the operation were designated
heroes of the Soviet Union, that country's highest honor.
   Despite lead shielding on the aircraft and other protective
gear, Grishchenko suffered radiation sickness and was found to have
radiation-related leukemia last year.
   He arrived in Seattle on April 11 for the marrow transplant,
which was performed after chemotherapy and radiation treatment to
kill off his own marrow.
   The transplant went smoothly, but Grischenko's condition
suddenly deteriorated in mid-June. Antibiotics had failed to knock
out the lung infection, which Grishchenko developed before coming
to Seattle.
   The pre-transplant therapy leaves patients with no natural
immunity against disease until the new marrow, which is
transplanted intravenously, takes hold.
   ``There's a lot of sadness. It's been difficult watching him not
progress, and as with all our patients, we hope they come here, be
treated and go home and have a long life,'' Edmonds said. ``It was
very sad to watch him have problems and grow worse.''
   Grishchenko's wife of 27 years, Galina, was at his bedside,
Edmonds said.
   At least 31 deaths are officially blamed on the April 26, 1986,
explosion and fire at the plant in the Ukraine. Scientists say many
more people may eventually be stricken with radiation-related
diseases.

<HEAD>Al Sharpton Cleared in Fraud Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton was cleared of charges he
stole some $250,000 from a civil rights organization. He declared
the verdict proved he was targeted by prosecutors for his role in
the Tawana Brawley case.
   The jury that sat through the three-month trial deliberated less
than six hours Monday before acquitting him of 67 counts of fraud
and larceny.
   At a victory party at the Cotton Club in Harlem, Sharpton said
of state Attorney General Robert Abrams: ``When he can't get one
out of 67 counts, not one, to stick, then it's clear it was a
vendetta.''
   Two years ago, Sharpton had served as a spokesman for Miss
Brawley, the black teen-ager who was found by a grand jury to have
concocted a story of rape and abduction at the hands of a gang of
white men.
   During the Brawley investigation, Sharpton had accused law
enforcement authorities of a racist cover-up.
   The flamboyant Sharpton has taken part in other racially charged
cases, acting as spokesman earlier this year for the family of a
black teen-ager slain by a white mob in the city's Bensonhurst
section.
   Abrams spokesman Ed Barbini said: ``We accept the verdict of the
jury. We could not ignore the body of evidence that pointed to
improprieties at the National Youth Movement, and we felt it was
our obligation to take these allegations before a jury.''
   Sharpton had been charged with stealing from the National Youth
Movement, an organization he started at age 16. He faced up to
seven years in prison if convicted.
   Assistant Attorney General Victor Genecin had charged that
Sharpton ``sold ideals'' and then cheated the very people he was
supposed to be helping.
   The defense called no witnesses; the state called more than 80.
   Defense attorney Alton Maddox had said Abrams brought the
charges out of vindictiveness because of Sharpton's role in the
Brawley case.
   Sharpton still faces tax fraud charges in a separate case in
Albany.

<HEAD>Lawyers Hot Under Collar After Air Conditioning Turned Off</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   County commissioners turned up the heat
on state authorities they accuse of paying too little rent for
space in the Berkshire County courthouse.
   They shut off the air conditioning.
   Lawyers in Chief Administrative Justice Arthur Mason's office,
not surprisingly, are hot under the collar. They're considering
appealing to the state Supreme Court, asking that the air
conditioning be restored to the 19th-century courthouse in this
western Massachusetts city.
   ``We've had both phone calls and correspondence ... indicating
that the situation is very uncomfortable,'' Michael Edgerton, a
lawyer for the Massachusetts Trial Court in Boston, said Monday.
   Massachusetts pays rent to counties for space in local
courthouses for state courts and offices.
   County Commissioner Peter F. Menard said the state plans to pay
$305,000, about $100,000 less than the amount the county believes
is owed. A dozen other counties are unhappy with the amount of rent
they are getting from the state and all 13 are appealing the issue,
Menard said.
   Commissioners don't plan to turn the air conditioning back on
``unless there's a court order or court rent,'' Menard said.
   State officials, facing a budget deficit of more than $1
billion, say they don't have the money.
   ``Our position is that we've paid out all the money that's been
appropriated to the counties and we certainly can't pay out more
than the state has,'' Edgerton said.
   Menard said he doesn't know why lawyers and other state office
employees are complaining. The courthouse has only had air
conditioning in all rooms for about a year, he said.
   The electric bill jumped $10,000 to $45,000 last year and
commissioners decided they had to cut back, he said.
   Courthouse employees said the temperature is comfortable in

<HEAD>Activists Attach Condoms to Newspapers in Protest over AIDS
Cartoon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS activists attached condoms to 2,000 coin-box
copies of The Arizona Republic to protest an editorial cartoon that
one protester claimed amounted to ``AIDS hate-mongering.''
   The June 26 cartoon by the newspaper's editorial cartoonist
Scott Stantis showed two men walking into a bathhouse and one
saying, ``It puts me in a tizzie to think the government hasn't
done a thing to stop the spread of AIDS.''
   The Phoenix chapter of the national AIDS Coalition To Unleash
Power, or ACT UP, said it attached the condoms in packages
emblazoned with the group's name to Monday's editions of the
newspaper on sale in Phoenix and three suburbs.
   ``That cartoon presents such misinformation, it's a heinous
crime to the Valley,'' said the chapter's vice chairman, Jeff
Ofstedahl, 26. ``It was AIDS hate-mongering. ... It's been the gay
community that's been chiefly responsible for closing down the
bathhouses.''
   Stantis said the cartoon was inspired by the ``abominable''
disruption of last month's Sixth International Conference on AIDS
in San Francisco by AIDS activists who drowned out a speech by
Health Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   The activists have criticized U.S. immigration restrictions on
people with AIDS and say more money needs to be put toward the
fight against AIDS.
   David Hume, a spokesman for Phoenix Newspapers Inc., said those
who disagree with an editorial commentary ``can promote their views
through letters to the editor, opposite-editorial columns and
discussions with our editorial page writers. We hope that those
with objections to anything we publish would do so in a civil
manner.''

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell against most other major
currencies today in early European trading. Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers predicted the dollar would trade in a narrow range ahead
of Wednesday's Independence Day holiday in the United States and
ahead of Friday's release of U.S. unemployment data.
   Traders said European markets were focussing on the British
pound.
   Monday's comments by Deutsche Bundesbank President Karl Otto
Poehl that he expects the pound to enter the European monetary
system's exchange rate mechanism ``soon'' have sent the British
currency soaring.
   ``The pound has very little downside potential,'' said Paul
Brewer, senior dealer at Salomon Brothers International in London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.28 yen to a closing 151.68 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 151.81 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.6567 West German marks, down from 1.6580
   _ 1.3990 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030
   _ 5.5580 French francs, down from 5.5635
   _ 1.8635 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8650
   _ 1,215.85 Italian lire, down from 1,217.00
   _ 1.1635 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1616
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.7718, compared
with $1.7635 late Monday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $357.40 a
troy ounce this morning, down from $357.55 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $357.35, down from $357.80 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose 15 cents to close at a bid $358.54.
   Silver was unchanged in London at a bid price of $4.95 a troy
ounce.

<HEAD>Full Sovereignty Proclaimed by Slovenian Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawmakers who replaced the
Communists as leaders of the prosperous northern republic of
Slovenia have proclaimed the state's full sovereignty, but stopped
short of calling for secession.
   There was no immediate reaction to the Slovenian declaration
from federal authorities or from rival Serbia.
   Monday's parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an
independent legal system that would take precedence over federal
laws and for Slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the
republic, state media said.
   The document said Slovenia should adopt a new democratic
constitution within the next 12 months, but made no mention of
earlier calls for the republic to secede from the troubled Yugoslav
federation.
   The media said a joint session of the republic's 240-seat
legislature voted unanimously to adopt the Declaration of
Sovereignty of the State of Slovenia.
   Slovenia contains 2 million of Yugoslavia's total population of
23 million.
   The Ljubljana nightly television news said the declaration asked
Slovenian authorities to ``assume control over units of the
(Yugoslav) armed forces stationed on Slovenian territory,'' and
said a 30 percent cut in defense spending would be implemented.
   A coalition of center-right parties formed a new government last
month in Slovenia, the most prosperous of Yugoslavia's six
republics, after trouncing reform Communists in the first free
state elections held in Communist-ruled Yugoslavia in 45 years.
   The republic's new authorities demand that Yugoslavia transform
itself into a loose confederation of sovereign states. They
threaten that Slovenia will declare full independence from
Yugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposals
for a confederation.
   Yugoslavia, including Slovenia, was created in 1918.
   Premier Lojze Peterle and other Slovenian leaders also say
Slovenia should take urgent steps to join the European Community,
no matter what Yugoslavia's Communist-ruled southern states say.
   The demands have been echoed in Croatia, the country's
second-largest state. A center-right party came to power there last
month in free elections.
   The hard-line Communist government in the largest state of
Serbia vehemently opposes turning Yugoslavia into a confederation.
   Serbia rejects Western-style democracy and does not plan to hold
free elections for at least another year.
   The Slovenian declaration also said police should take over
control of frontiers with neighboring Italy and Austria, replacing
border guards deployed for the past 45 years by Yugoslavia's
Communist government, Ljubljana TV said.
   It said the state would establish its own intelligence and
counter-intelligence services, that would be independent of their
Communist-controlled federal counterparts.
   The adoption of a declaration of sovereignty has been under
discussion in the new Parliament since the new government was
installed in May.
   Slovenia's president, Milan Kucan, has said that Slovenia
intends to proclaim sovereignty as part of its drive for liberal
political and economic reform in Yugoslavia.
   The timing of Monday's proclamation by Slovenia may have been
affected by Serbia's sudden decision last week to hold a special
referendum Sunday and Monday on adopting consitutional reforms that
would virtually destroy any remaining autonomy for its troubled
province of Kosovo.
   Slovenia and Croatia increasingly have sided with Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority in its drive for autonomy from Serbia.
   In Kosovo's capital of Pristina, after Serbian police on Monday
barred about 100 ethnic Albanian deputies from entering the
province's Parliament, about 40 deputies proclaimed Kosovo equal to
the six Yugoslav republics.
   The deputies want to revoke a constitutional amendment that gave
Serbia almost total control over Kosovo.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin was
hospitalized in good condition today after breaking his right hip
in a fall at his home, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   The spokeswoman, Dvorah Weissman, said Begin was undergoing
surgery: ``He was fully conscious when he came in and was aware of
his injury.''
   It was the second time the 76-year-old Begin was taken to
Shaarei Tzedek Hospital in Jerusalem this year. He was admitted
with pneumonia on May 16 and released two weeks later.
   Begin became prime minister in May 1977 when the left-of-center
Labor Party fell from 30 years in power during national elections.
   He stepped down as prime minister in September 1983 without
giving a public explanation. He was believed to be depressed about
Israel's military involvement in Lebanon, which had begun with a
June 1982 invasion launched under his leadership.
   His wife, Aliza, had died a year earlier.
   Since resigning, Begin has lived in seclusion, rarely emerging
from his apartment at the edge of the Jerusalem Forest. He receives
visits only from a small circle of aides and former colleagues.
   Begin has a history of a heart condition from his early days in
office. He also underwent prostate surgery several years ago.
   Begin was the founder of the right-wing Herut Party, precursor
to the Likud bloc that now heads the Israeli Cabinet.

   J.C.R. Licklider, a psychologist and a
pioneer in computer use who believed computers could help people
think and make decisions, has died of complications of an asthma
attack. He was 75.
   Licklider died at Symmes Hospital June 26, and his death was
announced Monday by Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he
was a professor emeritus in electrical engineering.
   Licklider was among the first to recognize that the full
potential of computers could be reached only by improving users'
ability to interact with them. He believed computers need not only
be used to generate information.
   His views were supported by the Defense Departments' Advanced
Research Projects Agency, which established large-scale
experimental computer science research projects at universities
around the country.
   Licklider headed the first one, Project MAC, from 1968 to 1970.
It now is the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science.
   He contributed to the application of computers in libraries,
introducing the concepts of digital computers and
telecommunications into the processes of storing and retrieving
information.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Prime Minister Says Baltics Will Forge Common Strategy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene of Lithuania
says leaders of the three Baltic republics will meet next week to
devise a strategy for independence talks with the Kremlin.
   Mrs. Prunskiene, who returned from a visit to Finland and
Estonia on Monday night, said she wanted all three Baltic states to
be involved in negotiations with the Kremlin but that the Moscow
leadership was opposed to the idea.
   The official Tass news agency quoted her as saying at a news
conference in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius that Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia would work together on Lithuania's approach to
negotiations with the Kremlin.
   Meanwhile, Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said the initial
phase of the independence talks would be the most difficult as
Lithuania offers its ideas about its future course.
   ``If the republic remains a part of the U.S.S.R. with some
special status, this will call for one scenario,'' he said. ``If
they categorically insist on seceding from the U.S.S.R.,
negotiations will have a completely different scenario.''
   Ryzhkov also told the unofficial Interfax news agency that talks
between the Kremlin and Lithuania should be held at the prime
ministerial level.
   But he said ``unfortunately, we have received no answer yet from
the Lithuanian leaders as to who will negotiate with Soviet
officials, on the level of prime minister or otherwise.''
   The Soviet government, responding to Lithuania's agreement to a
moratorium on its declaration of independence, resumed pumping oil
to Lithuania's largest refinery at Mazhiekia on Saturday.
   But motorists in Lithuania are still finding it difficult to buy
gasoline for their personal use, a parliamentary spokesman in
Vilnius said.
   Gasoline is going mainly to agricultural concerns, said Haris
Subacius, a spokesman for the Supreme Council legislature.
   ``The blockade is being lifted, but we cannot feel it yet,''
Subacius said. He said it would probably be two or three weeks
before the situation was normal.
   The Soviet government cut off shipment of all oil, most natural
gas and numerous other items to Lithuania on April 18 in an attempt
to force it to rescind its March 11 declaration of independence.
   Natural gas shipments were to be resumed today, the news agency
Postfactum said, but there was no information on supplies of other
raw materials that were blocked by the Kremlin.
   On Friday, the Lithuanian parliament accepted a compromise which
traded a 100-day moratorium on the independence decree for an
immediate end to the blockade and the start of negotiations.
   Subacius said the negotiations between Vilnius and Moscow could
begin within two weeks.

<TEXT>
   A West German chemical company has agreed to
pay $3.75 million to a woman who claimed her leukemia was caused by
a detergent used to launder her diapers 23 years ago.
   Fawna Wright, 23, of Mound City, Ill., reached the settlement
with BASF Wyandotte Corp. on Monday. Her lawyers contended
chemicals in Loxene may have harmed thousands of infants before the
detergent was pulled from the market in the 1960s.
   ``I'm amazed by it,'' said Wright, whose leukemia is in
remission. ``Something that happened as a baby took part of my
life.''
   Wright had sued in 1985, maintaining her illness was caused by
chemicals in Loxene that included pentachlorophenol, a substance
more widely used as a pesticide and wood preservative. The trial
was to have begun Monday.
   Despite being warned as early as 1959 that pentachlorophenol was
unsafe, the company instructed Booth Memorial Hospital in St.
Louis, where Wright was born, in how to use Loxene on diapers, crib
sheets and other linens, the lawsuit charged.
   The now-defunct hospital was operated by the Salvation Army for
unwed mothers.
   The Salvation Army agreed to pay Wright $5,000, and Dow Chemical
Co. setttled for $60,000, said her lawyer, Robert S. Bogard. Dow
and Monsanto Co. were accused of manufacturing chemicals in the
detergent. Monsanto was dropped as a defendant.
   In a statement, BASF said that it is ``not directly responsible
for her condition'' because the hospitals ``disregarded clearly
stated use instructions and warnings.''
   Wright became gravely ill when she was 5 days old but recovered.
At age 12, she was diagnosed as having leukemia, the lawsuit said.
   Because of sealed records, Wright's lawyers said they were able
to trace only eight other babies born at Booth during the time the
hospital used Loxene.
   Two died as infants and a third suffers from a learning
disability, the lawyers said. In 1966, an outbreak of illness
attributed to Loxene at Pembina County Hospital in Cavalier, N.D.,
left one infant dead, they said.
   Bogard said Wyandotte Chemical, as the company was known at the
time, should have removed Loxene after the North Dakota outbreak
instead of waiting until the product's registration was revoked
more than a year later.
   ``We now have hundreds of persons exposed at Booth or other
hospitals using Loxene during the 1960s who may be suffering from
problems,'' Bogard said.

   The oil spill in the Chesapeake Bay probably
will have a minimal effect on the environment, the Coast Guard says.
   Officials said about 30,000 gallons of fuel oil went into the
bay and the Elizabeth River when two cargo ships collided at the
mouth of the estuary on Sunday.
   A Coast Guard board of investigation was to convene today to
take testimony from the ships' crews.
   Capt. Eugene K. Johnson, commander of the Coast Guard Marine
Safety Office, said aerial surveys showed that the oil in the bay
was dissipating but that some had washed ashore on Norfolk beaches.
He said most of the oil was in the river.
   ``I think the environmental impact on the bay will be minimal,''
Johnson said Monday.
   The bridge crews and pilots of both ships were given drug and
alcohol tests, a standard procedure after such accidents, but the
results were not yet available, he said.
   Environmentalists were concerned that the spill could
contaminate spawning blue crabs in the mouth of the bay. But Robert
Byrne, associate director of research at the Virginia Institute of
Marine Science, said it appeared the crabs might be spared because
most of the oil was in the river.
   Johnson said the cleanup would take several days. About 150
people and five oil skimmers collected about 1,500 gallons Monday,
he said.
   The outbound Columbus America, en route to Melbourne, Australia,
sustained extensive damage, the Coast Guard said. Johnson said the
ship's owner, Columbus America Inc. of Hamburg, West Germany, has
agreed to pay for the cleanup.
   Officials had no estimate of what the cleanup would cost.
   The Singapore-registered Neptune Jade, which was inbound,
received minor damage, the Coast Guard said.
   The Columbus America's 140,000-gallon fuel oil tank ruptured in
the collision. The ship's captain immediately returned to port,
heading for a ship repair yard and leaking fuel along the way, the
Coast Guard said.
   ``It was his determination that the problem could not be fixed
at sea, and he chose to return to port. We concurred,'' Johnson
said.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo said he doesn't know much
about the Australian barroom sport of dwarf tossing, but he's
treating seriously a bill that would outlaw it in New York state.
   ``These are human beings,'' Cuomo said Monday. ``This disturbs
me, I don't know why.''
   The bill, approved by the Legislature on Saturday, would ban the
barroom games of dwarf tossing and dwarf bowling.
   ``I can't anticipate not signing it,'' said Cuomo, although he
said he wasn't making any promises.
   ``If they said you could toss female dwarfs, but not male
dwarfs, then I wouldn't sign it,'' he said. ``I would like the
option of reading it.''
   People compete to throw a dwarf the farthest in dwarf tossing.
In dwarf bowling, a dwarf is strapped to a skateboard and pushed
toward bowling pins.
   Both activities have been banned in Florida.
   Under the New York bill, any bar or restaurant permitting the
games could lose its liquor licence. Sponsors said the games have
been played in bars in New York City, Long Island and Schenectady.
Dwarfs have been paid for taking part.

<TEXT>
   It started looking bad for the first Soviet
football team to play on American soil when the players heard the
Turkish national anthem played in their honor.
   It went downhill from there.
   The Soviet national champion Moscow Bears were whipped 61-0
Monday night by the year-old Tacoma Express, a minor-league
football team, in an exhibition game before 1,300 spectators in the
Tacoma Dome.
   The game was billed by promoters as Glasnost on the Gridiron.
   Bears coach John Ralston, a former Denver Broncos head coach,
didn't talk game strategy or give his players a fiery pep talk
before the game. He explained to them how to suit up in full pads.
   ``Don't forget, you need your thigh pads, your knee pads and
your elbow pads,'' he said through an interpreter. ``You don't want
to land on that AstroTurf without your elbow pads.''
   The Moscow Bears are among some 20 teams in the fledgling Soviet
Union American Football League founded a year ago. For the past
eight weeks, Ralston has been trying to mold the group of onetime
rugby players, shot-putters, javelin throwers and decathletes into
a professional football team.
   After Monday night, it was clear he still has a ways to go.
   ``I'm disappointed in our fundamentals,'' he said after the
game. ``I don't think we do the fundamentals very well.''
   The Bears are playing at least four American exhibition games
arranged by an Alabama sports promotion company. The team is to
play in Fresno, Calif., Oklahoma City and Macon, Ga., with a
possible match in Charlotte, N.C.
   The starting quarterback first touched a football seven months
ago, and he's the veteran. Ralston's biggest player tips the scales
at 250 pounds.
   Ralston had said he mainly wanted to ensure his players finished
the game intact _ especially his starting tight end, since both
backups had been detained in the Soviet Union by the KGB the night
before departure.
   The Bears suffered no major injuries.
   The anthem mixup wasn't the only glitch. Fans found their
programs carried no numbers for the Soviet players. The announcer
searched in vain for starting lineups while waiting for a Soviet
interpreter who never got to the booth. She stayed on the field to
relay Ralston's play calls and other assignments.
   ``I had a dream three weeks ago that I was calling a football
game and that I didn't know the players or what was going on. The
dream came true. What a nightmare!'' said Tim Harrington, a
play-by-play announcer for radio station KKMO.
   When it came time for national anthems, the Soviets appeared
stunned when they heard the selection played for them.
   Organizers discovered their mistake while the American anthem
was being sung. Fans and players then stood a third time to listen
to the real Soviet anthem.
   Tacoma built a 13-0 lead after one quarter and a 34-0 advantage
by halftime. With the Express leading 48-0 after three quarters,
the fans began to chant: ``Go, Bears!''
   Ralston said earlier that competition, or the lack of it, could
be a hurdle. ``In the whole Communist system, there's no incentive
for being better than somebody else,'' he said. ``There's no
competition, and that hurts.''
   Until this week, the players were outfitted in whatever castoff
equipment they could find, he said. He told of watching games where
a team had equipment for only two dozen players, and players had to
trade helmets and pads when they went in as substitutes.
   But thanks to American corporate sponsors who have donated 100
pairs of shoes and enough helmets and pads for the whole team, the
Bears will return to Moscow as well dressed as most minor-league
American teams.

<HEAD>Japan Rejects Pravda Idea on Kuril Islands Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan today rejected as premature a Soviet proposal
to share ownership of Soviet-held islands in the Kuril chain, which
Japan claims as its own.
   ``We insist that they do belong to Japan ... and that subject
should be cleared up first,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo
Watanabe said at a news conference. But he said the proposal was
``interesting.''
   The issue is a longstanding sore point that has prevented the
Soviet Union and Japan from signing a peace treaty to formally end
World War II.
   Earlier this week, political commentator Vsevolod Ovchinnikov
wrote in Pravda, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper, that the
dispute over the islands could be settled if Tokyo and Moscow
agreed to place the islands under United Nations trusteeship as a
special economic zone jointly owned by the Soviet Union and Japan.
   Soviet troops occupied the islands in the closing days of World
War II.
   Japan insists that the islands were Japanese by longstanding
agreement and that they were not ``war booty'' to be taken from
Japanese rule.
   The Soviets have said repeatedly that the issue was settled long
ago, and they refuse to consider Japan's demand.
   Japan has been cool to suggestions by other Western countries to
give financial help to the Soviets to help bolster President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic liberalization.
   Watanabe, asked about such proposals to aid Moscow, said Japan
does not stand in the way of other countries' giving money, but the
lack of a peace treaty prevents Tokyo from supplying aid.
   ``That is a problem we've got to solve first before we can go
into large-scale economic cooperation with that country,'' he told
foreign journalists.
   Later this year, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze is
expected to visit Tokyo for talks preparing for an official visit
Gorbachev has announced for next year. The territorial issue would
be high on the agenda for the Gorbachev visit.
   The islands, off the coast of northernmost Japan, lie in waters
rich with fish, and have some strategic importance in controlling
sea lanes between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk.

   Anatoly Grishchenko, a Soviet helicopter pilot
who contracted leukemia after trying to douse the fire at the
Chernobyl nuclear plant, died late Monday of cardiopulmonary
failure. He was 53.
   Grishchenko had been in critical condition with a lung infection
for more than two weeks at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center,
where he had received a bone-marrow transplant April 27.
   Grishchenko in 1986 repeatedly flew his heavy-lift copter
through the intensely radioactive gases spewing from the Chernobyl
plant, dumping sand and cement in an overmatched effort to cap the
crippled reactor.
   He and a handful of others in the operation were designated
heroes of the Soviet Union, that country's highest honor.

   The Philippines can pursue its legal
effort to recover assets purportedly hidden by the late President
Ferdinand Marcos, despite his wife's acquittal by a New York court,
a Swiss official said today.
   However, Marcos attorneys in Switzerland said the New York
verdict appeared to back their argument that Imelda Marcos cannot
be held responsible for alleged crimes by her late husband. They
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The verdict, reached Monday, cleared Mrs. Marcos of looting $222
million from the Philippine treasury and sinking it into Manhattan
real estate and other investments.
   The New York jurors told reporters they were unconvinced that
Mrs. Marcos knew of her husband's alleged wrongdoings.
   Swiss Justice Department spokesman Joerg Kistler, however, said
the acquittal has no legal effect on the Swiss proceedings.
   ``It would be wrong to conclude from the acquittal in New York
that Swiss judicial aid to the Philippines is not permissible,'' he
said.
   Switzerland is helping the Philippines government of President
Corazon Aquino in its quest for Swiss courts to order the return of
assets the Marcos clan purportedly deposited in accounts here. The
Philippines claims the asserts were ``ill-gotten gains.''
   But appeals by Marcos' lawyers have blocked any return of money
or handing over of bank documents since Marcos was ousted and
forced to flee his country in February 1986. At that time, Mrs.
Aquino was swept to power by what became known as the ``people
power'' rebellion.
   The Swiss accounts involved in the case are believed to contain
several hundred million dollars, although the new Philippine
government originally spoke of billions.
   Moritz Leuenberger, one of the Aquino government's Swiss
lawyers, had said earlier a guilty verdict for Mrs. Marcos would
provide only ``a psychological edge'' in the Swiss proceedings.

<HEAD>Former Coca-Cola Bottlers Owner Dead at 65</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORMOND BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chapman Shaw Root, one of America's
wealthiest people and a former chairman of the country's largest
Coca-Cola bottling company, died after a long illness. He was 65.
   Root, a longtime resident of Ormond Beach, died Monday at
Atlanta's Emory Hospital. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   Root headed Associated Coca-Cola Bottlers from 1951 until 1982,
when he sold his 57.5 percent interest to the parent company of
Coca-Cola for $417.5 million. The company had plants in
Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and New Jersey.
   Last October, Forbes magazine listed Root as the 386th richest
person in America with a net worth of $290 million.
   In 1966, he formed the Root Co. as parent company of his
expanding financial holdings. At the time of his death, Root's also
owned such businesses as the Daytona Hilton and radio stations WNDB
and WWLV.
   A native of Terre Haute, Ind., Root was the grandson of Chapman
J. Root, founder and owner of Root Glass Co., the company that
designed and patented the distinctive wasp-waist Coca-Cola bottle
in the early 1900s.
   Chapman J. Root acquired several Coca-Cola bottling franchises,
which later became the Terre Haute-based Associated Coca-Cola
Bottlers.
   He is survived by his wife, Susan Spear Root; a daughter; five
sons; and 12 grandchildren.

<HEAD>Factory Orders Rebound 2.1 Percent in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
rebounded 2.1 percent in May, the government said today in another
report indicating the economy's weak industrial sector may be
bouncing back.
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $240.9 billion and
regained their 2.1 percent loss in April.
   The size of the May increase had been expected by many analysts.
At the same time, the April decline was smaller than the 2.3
percent drop initially reported last month.
   It was the third gain in orders since they dropped 5.5 percent
in January, their steepest decline since a 7.0 percent decrease in
December 1974. All major categories advanced except non-durable
orders which were unchanged at $112.4 billion.
   There have been other recent signs of an improving manufacturing
sector, including a 0.6 percent jump in industrial production in
May.
   Factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing
industry plans for production. A decrease in orders could result in
a slump in that sector and subsequent layoffs.
   But much of the improvement has been attributed to exports.
American consumers, on the other hand, have slowed their purchases,
which had been a major driving force during the 7{ years of
economic expansion.
   And the construction industry remains stalled. Commerce reported
on Monday that spending fell 0.4 percent in May for its second
straight monthly decline.
   Commerce said the increase in new factory orders was
concentrated in durables _ big-ticket items expected to last at
least three years. They were up 4.0 percent to $128.6 billion and
nearly regained their 4.1 percent decline in April.
   Durable goods orders had been reported up 3.9 percent in the
department's initial report on June 22.
   Most of the increase was in transportation orders, up 10.1
percent to $35.5 billion. Automobiles accounted for most of the
gain, although defense aircraft orders also were up.
   Excluding transportation, orders rose 0.8 percent.
   In the key category of non-defense capital goods, a barometer of
business investment plans, orders slipped 1.5 percent to $36.0
billion. They had fallen 10.6 percent in April after a March gain
of 13.3 percent.
   Shipments rose 2.0 percent to $238.9 billion, more than
offsetting April's 1.3 percent decline and exceeding the previous
record of $238.2 billion set last August.
   Unfilled orders increased 0.4 percent to $520.3 billion and
inventories were unchanged at $372.4 billion. Inventories have been
relatively flat since last July.
   Among the durable sector, non-electrical machinery orders rose
3.5 percent to $22.3 billion, nearly erasing April's 3.7 percent
loss. Electrical machinery orders advanced 0.8 percent to $20.6
billion after a 4.4 percent gain. Primary metals orders were up 1.7
percent to $11.8 billion, nearly matching April's 1.6 percent drop.
   The volatile defense category posted a 19.2 percent gain to
$10.0 billion on top of increases of 4.8 percent and 4.5 percent
the previous two months. Excluding defense, orders were up 1.5
percent.

   Mr. Pig is rolling in it.
   The 150-pound gray-rumped hog, along with a German shepherd
named Calamity Jane, will be taken care of for the rest of their
lives after inheriting part of a $600,000-plus estate left by Margo
Lamp of Davenport, who died in February at 81.
   Chico the Amazon parrot is also living comfortably, despite
losing a large chunk of an inheritance to its late owner's
godchildren. But the fate of four cats _ Clementine, Martha, Gene
and Smudge _ hinges on what happens in probate court.
   The animals belonged to three Iowans who stipulated in their
wills that money from their estates be used for the well-being of
their pets. The owners all died over the last eight months.
   ``I don't think it's strange at all,'' said Susan Halberstadt of
the American Humane Association in Denver. ``It's a very special
bond that exists between people and their animals.''
   ``Many people are doing this,'' she said. ``Obviously these
people had a very deep, profound love for their pets.''
   Ms. Lamp willed the bulk of her estate to the Scott County
Humane Society but set aside money for her dog and her hog, Mr.
Pig. She had no close relatives and left $1,000 to a distant cousin
and $1,000 to a friend, said her lawyer, George Goebel.
   ``I think that what you have is older people, that because of
advanced age, their sphere of friends die _ disappear. Their pets
become close companions to them,'' he said.
   Chico's owner, Ellen ``Goldie'' Bengston of Clinton, left most
of her $70,000 estate in a trust for her parrot and a poodle named
Pipi. Pipi died soon after and Harold Bengston, the executor of his
sister's estate, asked a judge to reduce the amount set aside for
the bird.
   The amount was lowered to $18,000, with the rest of the money
going to two of Ms. Bengston's godchildren.
   Melody Stanton of Camanche willed her $12,000 estate to the four
cats. Her mother, Eleanor Hodge, said it was stipulated that the
money be used ``for the care and comfort of the only possessions I
have in my life _ my animals, my cats.''
   But Ms. Hodge said a number of debts will have to be paid out of
the estate, which is being contested by a man who lived with her
daughter. A hearing is set for July 17.

   Arson investigators have received
hundreds of tips since Gov. George Deukmejian posted $50,000
rewards for information leading to the culprits in two wildfires
that destroyed nearly 500 homes.
   No arrests have been made, but authorities reported progress in
Glendale, where 46 homes were destroyed and 26 damaged by a fire
set Wednesday in 105-degree, windy weather.
   Fire Capt John Orr said Monday that Glendale officials had
tracked down the owners of two cars who were nearby when the fire
was started by a butane lighter rigged with a pin to keep burning.
A third car was being sought.
   ``At this point they're witnesses as far as we're concerned,''
Orr said.
   In Santa Barbara, where a fire destroyed 430 homes and 28
apartment buildings and killed a woman, investigators found what
they described as an incendiary device in a remote area.
   The New York Times reported the device was a match, and the Los
Angeles Times said the device was sent to the FBI for analysis.
   Officials declared the 4,500-acre fire fully controlled at 6
a.m. today, said Maeton Freel, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman.
Some of the 710 firefighters planned to remain several days on
mop-up operations, he said.
   Orr said the fires were believed set by so-called vanity
pyromaniacs, who want attention or perhaps to become firefighters,
or by true pyromaniacs, who are thrilled, sometimes sexually, by
watching the destruction.
   Investigators are concentrating on interviewing anyone who was
on hand when the fire began, officials said.
   ``Arson is the only crime where the suspect sticks around,'' Orr
said.
   Even after a fire is out, investigators haunt the area where it
began.
   ``Sometimes these firebugs will come back,'' said Maeton Freel,
Forest Service information officer for the Santa Barbara fire. ``If
they can catch them coming back, even if they can't arrest them
right away sometimes they can backtrack.''

<TEXT>
   When she reported for jury selection three
months ago, Imelda Marcos posed the question: Why was she being
tried here instead of in her homeland?
   After the prosecution had called its 95th and final witness, the
judge was equally curious to ask why a U.S. court was trying a case
involving the theft of money from the Philippines.
   The jury was puzzled, too, and on Monday it settled the issue.
   ``We are not big brothers to the people overseas,'' juror Thomas
O'Rourke said. ``It was a totally silly case.''
   The jury acquitted the former Philippines first lady of charges
she helped her husband loot $222 million from their homeland and
hide the money in art and U.S. real estate.
   Co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi also was acquitted of helping the
Marcoses hide ownership of their investments.
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier's office praised
the work of the prosecutors and said: ``The jury has rendered its
verdict. Our system of justice has spoken.''
   In Manila, President Corazon Aquino said she was disappointed by
the acquittal and said Mrs. Marcos was still barred from returning
home for security reasons. Her officials said they are ready to
file charges against Mrs. Marcos if she is allowed to return.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan ruled that U.S. courts
properly had jurisdiction, citing a precedent set in an earlier
case and the fact that the disputed real estate purchases had
occurred in New York. But the judge had wondered why the United
States was prosecuting a former ally.
   ``I want to find out what the frauds were here in America,
because Mrs. Aquino can enforce her own laws,'' he said last month.
``I don't want to enforce her laws here.''
   Legal experts who watched the case said the jury could follow
standards different from those Keenan was required to adhere to by
legal precedent.
   ``The jury probably said, `We don't care. It's the Philippines'
problem if it's anybody's,''' said Vivian Berger, a professor at
Columbia University Law School.
   Whether Mrs. Marcos was properly tried in the United States was
not the only reason for acquittal, jurors said. A sympathy factor
and what they saw as a weak government case also played a role.
   ``We thought the government did a terrible, terrible job,'' said
O'Rourke. ``They had half-truths and not the right witnesses. It
was a terrible case.''
   ``It was a poorly prepared case,'' said jury forewoman Catherine
Balton. ``There was nothing to convince any of them that there was
a case.''
   O'Rourke said the U.S. government should have dropped the case
when Marcos died in September, three years after the couple fled to
exile in Hawaii.
   ``For three years they have made this poor woman's life
miserable,'' he said. The trial was interrupted three times because
Mrs. Marcos fell ill. On one occasion, she collapsed in front of
the jury and coughed up blood.
   Witnesses testified that the Marcoses, through associates and
friends, secretly funneled millions of dollars out of their country
and bought four New York buildings, jewelry for Mrs. Marcos and art.
   The central issue jurors had to decide was how much Mrs. Marcos
knew about her husband's alleged corrupt practices. They were
unconvinced of her involvement, clearing her of racketeering,
conspiracy, fraud and obstruction.
   ``Just because she was married to him doesn't make her guilty,''
Ms. Balton said.

   Lloyd W. Hazleton, founder of Hazleton
Laboratories, one of the world's largest biological testing

   Hazleton, 79, died of cancer Saturday at his McLean home.
   Hazleton, who had a doctorate in pharmacology, founded the
biotechnology research company with his wife, Harriet Rosenzweig
Hazleton, in 1946 on the grounds of an old country schoolhouse in
Fairfax.
   The company, originally known as Hazleton Laboratories America
Inc., became one of the world's largest biological testing
services, doing pre-tests of new chemicals for virtually every
major chemical, cosmetic and pharmaceutical manufacturer.
   He sold the company in 1968 and retired as president. The
company is now known as the Hazleton Corp. and is based in Herndon,
Va.
   Hazleton, a native of Washington state, moved to the Washington,
D.C., area in 1939 when he joined the faculty of Georgetown
University medical school as a pharmacology professor. He left
Georgetown two years later and taught at George Washington until he
founded Hazleton Laboratories.
   His first wife, Harriet Hazleton, died in 1986.
   Survivors include his wife, Grace Murphy Hazleton; three
children; a sister; and six grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will urge the NATO allies this
week to adjust to changing times by adopting new strategies for
repelling a Soviet attack with fewer nuclear weapons and fewer
troops along Europe's East-West divide, U.S. officials say.
   The most dramatic aspect of the change will be to make the use
of nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort. Quietly, however,
the NATO allies also will respond to a diminished Soviet threat by
thinning out their ground forces along the East-West frontier.
   Instead, the officials told The Associated Press on Monday, a
heavy proportion of NATO troops will be deployed at various points
behind the East-West line, prepared to rush to any breach in
Western defenses.
   A pending treaty to sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet troops,
tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arms in Europe is
contributing to the revision in strategy that Bush and the leaders
of the 15 other NATO countries will undertake in London on Thursday
and Friday.
   There simply will be fewer U.S. troops in Europe, and fewer
Soviet soldiers to defend against.
   Moreover, East Germany is about to be absorbed by West Germany,
removing the one-time staunch Soviet ally from the front line and
requiring a tactical shift in the alignment of NATO troops.
   As part of the new Western approach, Bush is ready to consider
scrapping the 1,470 U.S. nuclear-tipped artillery shells now based
mostly in West Germany and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of
1,560 U.S. nuclear bombs deployed in seven NATO countries, the
officials said.
   The disclosures left at least some American liberals unimpressed.
   Paul Warnke, the chief arms control negotiator in the Carter
administration, said the administration was stalling while trying
to make NATO look ``a little less threatening.''
   Warnke said the anticipated withdrawal of some nuclear weapons
was only cosmetic, and that the 700 U.S. nuclear-tipped Lance
missile still in Western Europe should be pulled out as well.
   At a news conference, Warnke said the missiles were aimed at
East Germany, and could also be used against Poland and
Czechoslovakia. ``There is no purpose, there is no targeting sense
to their being there anymore,'' Warnke said.
   But, Warnke said, the Bush administration intends to replace the
withdrawn tactical nuclear weapons with sea-launched cruise
missiles and a new air-to-surface missiles.
   And David Shorr, assistant director of The British American
Security Information Council, a private research group, said
``there has been scant recognition in the Bush administration that
the security situation in Europe has changed radically.''
   The change in nuclear policy is prompted by a vastly reduced
Soviet threat and the crumbling of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. For
instance, Hungary, whose parliament last week voted in a
non-binding resolution to leave the alliance, has quietly proposed
to NATO participating as ``observers'' in political, or
non-military, committees, a U.S. official said.
   The revision in NATO strategy would not strip the Western
alliance of all nuclear weapons, however. In fact, the Bush
administration has made sure in its arms control talks with the
Soviets to clear the way for production of a new short-range
nuclear weapon, the air-to-surface TASM.
   But the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, stressed
that the likelihood of an attack by the Red Army and other Warsaw
Pact forces, or a blitzkrieg that NATO could only push back with
nuclear weapons, was becoming very remote.
   Some of the changes Bush and the 15 other allied leaders will
approve will appear in the communique issued at the end of the
summit on Friday. Others, officials said, will be implemented in
the field with the pace partly determined by what the East does
about its forces.
   The shift in NATO thinking varies among the allies. Britain and
France are the least inclined to relax the nuclear deterrent, while
West Germany, Italy and the Scandinavian countries want to
de-emphasize nuclear weapons without abandoning them, an official
said.
   That places Bush somewhere in the middle of the debate, but also
prepared to scrub the concept of ``early first use'' of nuclear
weapons in the event of attack, the officials said.
   That theory was adopted in the 1960s over the opposition of
Robert S. McNamara, defense secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations. It calls for threatening _ and actually using _
nuclear weapons if NATO's forces are incapable of halting an
invasion of the Warsaw Pact, which has an edge of 2 to 1 in tanks
and artillery.
   But now, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is committed to
withdrawing tens of thousands of tanks and troops from Eastern and
Central Europe while most of the countries in the Warsaw Pact are
gradually leaving the Soviet orbit.
   Meanwhile, NATO and the Warsaw Pact are in the midst of
negotiating a treaty in Vienna that would limit Soviet troops in
Europe to 195,000, U.S. troops to 225,000, and set ceilings on
tanks, artillery and other categories of non-nuclear weapons.
   Bush responded in May by abandoning plans to replace the 88 U.S.
short-range Lance nuclear missile launchers in West Germany, the
Netherlands and Italy with a more powerful version.
   And now, according to the officials, he is ready to withdraw the
1,350 nuclear-tipped artillery shells deployed in West Germany and
120 others based in Germany, Turkey and Italy, if the allies concur.

<TEXT>
   In a major breakthrough toward
reconciliation of the two Koreas, the North and South today
completed negotiations on terms for a historic summit by prime
ministers of the rival nations.
   The meeting would be the first talks between top government
leaders of the Koreas since the 1945 division of the peninsula into
the Communist North and capitalist South. The talks could be held
as early as August.
   South Korean negotiator Song Han-ho told delegates at today's
session that the summit will open ``a new chapter for realizing
peaceful unification of the peninsula.''
   ``We cannot stick to the logic of the Cold War and ignore
changes in the world any longer,'' he said.
   The North's delegate, Paik Nam Jun, said today's talks ``marked
a new milestone in the history of the North-South Korea dialogue.''
   The delegates agreed to meet in the border village of Panmunjom
on July 26 to sign a negotiated accord that would outline a
proposed agenda for the top-level talks.
   The agreement calls for those talks to be held in alternating
capitals, starting with the South Korean city of Seoul.
   Today's decision to sign the accord was reached during a meeting
that lasted less than an hour. Unlike most dialogue between the two
countries, it was free of rancor.
   The session was the first in five months. The North suspended
dialogue to protest joint U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers.
   Although today's developments were hailed as a milestone in
Korean dialogue, some longtime observers cautioned the talks could
still falter.
   Years of hostility have bred distrust on both sides. The two
countries are still technically at war because no peace treaty was
signed after the Korean war from 1950 to 1953.

   Leaders of both houses of Congress
urged President Corazon Aquino today to reverse herself and let
Imelda Marcos come home after her New York acquittal on charges of
looting this nation's treasury.
   But Mrs. Aquino refused to relax the ban and accused Mrs. Marcos
of supporting a coup attempt in December.
   The president found herself politically isolated, with longtime
supporters joining Marcos loyalists in calling for the former first
lady's return. The constitution prevents her from being tried by a
Philippines court in abstentia.
   On Monday, a federal jury in New York cleared Mrs. Marcos of
allegations that she used $222 million in government funds to buy
real estate, art and jewelry. Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi was
acquitted of helping her conceal ownership.
   ``The acquittal does not alter the national interest and
security grounds on which we have premised our decision not to
allow the return of Mrs. Marcos at the present time,'' Mrs. Aquino
said.
   In a second statement later, Mrs. Aquino said intelligence
reports also showed that Mrs. Marcos ``encouraged and supported
those who wanted to grab power'' during the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt.
The fighting left 113 people dead and more than 600 injured.
   ``The return of Mrs. Marcos would enable her to mobilize the
underground network of the Marcos dictatorship, which is designed
to overthrow this government and endanger our democratic gains and
economic momentum,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   In a telephone interview with Manila radio station DZBB, Mrs.
Marcos said: ``I am not opposing Mrs. Aquino.
   ``I am not going to fight her. What I will do is just pray to
the Lord that I be allowed to come home. I know that He will grant
me this, just like my acquittal,'' she added.
   Despite Mrs. Aquino's stand, most key leaders of the Senate and
House of Representatives said Mrs. Marcos should be allowed to
return, if only to stand trial.
   House Speaker Ramon Mitra said Mrs. Marcos should never have
been tried abroad and that ``it is important that the arm of the
law gets hold of her and she gets her day in court.''
   ``In my view, Mrs. Marcos should be allowed to present her
defense before Philippine courts,'' said Senate President Jovito
Salonga, who was once jailed by Marcos.
   Senate Majority Leader Teofisto Guingona said that ``unless I am
shown specific proof that there is really danger to national
security, I would back allowing Mrs. Marcos to defend herself
personally here.''
   Philippine officials said today they were ready to file criminal
charges against Mrs. Marcos if the president allows the former
first lady to return.
   The Aquino government claims Marcos and his associates stole $10
billion before he was ousted in 1986.
   The issue of Mrs. Marcos is, however, especially difficult for
Mrs. Aquino because they share such a long and bitter history.
   Mrs. Marcos' husband, Ferdinand, was toppled by the 1986 popular
revolt that brought Mrs. Aquino to power. He died in September in
Hawaii.
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno, was slain upon returning home in
1983 to challenge Marcos.
   Some people suspect that personal bitterness between the two
widows plays a more important role than national security in the
decision to bar Mrs. Marcos.
   In addition, allowing Mrs. Marcos to return home now could be
perilous for Mrs. Aquino, whose own popularity is at a low ebb.
   Recent public opinion surveys point to dissatisfaction over high
prices, deteriorating infrastructure and perceived inefficiency in
the Aquino administration.
   The recent withdrawal of all U.S. Peace Corps members from the
country and reports that one of them has been kidnapped by
Communist rebels heightened concern about a deterioration of law
and order.
   Meanwhile, the military says renegade leaders of the December
coup attempt are again recruiting followers for another putsch.
   Mrs. Aquino has said she does not plan to run for re-election in
1992, and no clear favorite has emerged.
   Some political commentators believe that if Mrs. Marcos were
allowed to return, she could wield considerable influence in the
elections either by endorsing a candidate or running herself.

   Public school teachers earn the highest salaries
in Alaska and the lowest in South Dakota, according to a survey
that put the national average at $31,315.
   The average salary for U.S. public school teachers in 1989-90
rose 5.7 percent from a year ago, said the survey issued Monday at
the annual convention of the 744,000-member American Federation of
Teachers.
   Alaska had the highest average salary, $43,097, South Dakota the
lowest, $21,300.
   Average teacher salaries are nearly double 1980 levels of
$16,100 and more than triple the $9,705 earned in 1972. But after
adjusting for inflation, salaries have gone up a scant $68 a year
since 1972, the survey said.
   The statistics covered pay rates for the regular school year,
excluding extra pay for such things as working during the summer or
supervising extracurricular activities.
   Teacher salary increases exceeded inflation for the eighth
straight year and average starting salaries topped $20,000 for the
first time, AFT research director Jewell Gould told reporters today.
   But starting teacher pay remains $5,000 to $10,000 below most
other professions, Gould said. Starting engineers, for example,
earn $32,304 on average, according to the union statistics. Liberal
arts majors average $26,244, and beginning accountants average
$27,408.
   ``With the lousy working conditions most teachers face _ and the
lower salary levels _ it's no wonder people are choosing other
professions,'' said AFT president Albert Shanker.
   Teacher pay lags behind that of most other professions, he said.
Lawyers average $57,172, auditors $36,007 and chemists $47,081.
   ``The investment we are making in education, as it's reflected
in teachers' salaries, is simply not sufficient to meet the needs
of public education or our nation's work force,'' Shanker said.
   Starting teacher salaries averaged $20,476 in 1989-90, up 5.8
percent, according to the survey. Alaska's beginning pay topped the
list at $29,763; West Virginia's was lowest at $15,778.
   Average teacher salaries in all states were, in order:
   Alaska, $43,097
   Connecticut, $40,768
   District of Columbia, $39,850
   New York, $38,925

<TEXT>
   Rival factions of the Palestine
Liberation Organization clashed in this West Bank village, and
three Palestinians were killed and nine wounded when a grenade was
thrown, witnesses said today.
   The toll in the battle Monday was one of the worst in an
internal PLO dispute since the Palestinian uprising began more than
30 months ago. Villagers said it was between rival factions of the
Fatah wing of the PLO.
   Witnesses said the battle broke out during a memorial march for
a youth killed last year. They said hundreds of villagers fought
for several hours with rocks, firebombs and guns before the battle
ended with the grenade blast.
   The three dead were between the ages of 12 to 14 and the injured
were all youths or teen-agers, hospital officials and Palestinian
reporters said.
   The army confirmed the deaths and injuries, but said the clash
appeared to have been the result a clan feud. It said no troops
were involved.
   The army closed off the village today, but witnesses to the
clash told a reporter on Idna's outskirts that the clans involved
represent two groups within Fatah. Each side accuses the other of
collaborating with Israeli authorities, they said.
   Imad Batran, 16, told a reporter that one side in the village's
Fatah faction was staging a march for a 12-year-old killed by
soldiers a year ago, when a villager from the rival faction pulled
a knife on one of the marchers.
   He said the intruder was pushed aside but later tried to drive
into the marchers with a car, setting off a melee. Batran called
the intruder an Israeli informer but refused to give the man's name.
   ``I know his name but I will not say it,'' he said.
   Ahmad Rashid Tmaize, a 45-year-old villager from the other
faction, said the driver of the car was from his family but was
only driving near the march and accidentally got caught up in it.
   He said the organizers of the march were four young villagers
and referred to them as ``the gang of four ... the other Fatah who
are doing irresponsible things'' in the village. He said they had
argued with other PLO factions and extorting money from villagers.

<TEXT>
   China and Indonesia today agreed to restore
diplomatic relations suspended 23 years ago when the island nation
accused Beijing of supporting a Communist coup attempt there.
   The accord gives Beijing a diplomatic victory after a year of
being shunned by the West for calling in troops to put down
pro-democracy demonstrators last year. Hundreds of people were
killed.
   Relations between China and Indonesia will formally resume Aug.
8, said a brief communique issued today in Beijing. It was signed
by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and his Chinese
counterpart, Qian Qichen.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng is to visit Indonesia for the official
resumption of relations in August. Today's agreement caps more than
a year of talks.
   ``What we have achieved today ... signifies the turning of a new
page in our bilateral relations,'' Alatas told reporters after the
signing ceremony at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
   Qian called the communique ``a document of historical
significance.''
   Relations were suspended in 1967, when Indonesia accused China
of having sent weapons to Indonesian Communist Party rebels. The
Indonesian army crushed their 1965 coup attempt.
   Alatas said last week in Tokyo that China had promised not to
interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs _ Indonesia's main
condition for resuming ties.
   China's chief concern was addressed Monday with the signing of
an agreement for repayment of $84 million that Indonesia borrowed
from China before relations were frozen.

   Three members of the 2 Live Crew
rap group and a store owner who sold their album were formally
charged today with obsenity.
   Band members Luther Campbell, Mark Ross and Chris Wongwon were
charged with participating in an obscene performance, a first
degree misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a
$1,000 fine, according to the Broward State Attorney's Office.
   They were arrested after an adults-only concert in Hollywood on
June 10.
   E-C Records owner Charles Freeman of Fort Lauderdale was
formally charged with selling copies of the album, ``As Nasty as
They Wanna Be,'' which a federal judge ruled was obscene.
   But there may be problems for the prosecution, The Miami Herald
reported today. The videotape of the performance is too garbled to
understand, the band's defense attorney told the newspaper.
   ``It's terrible, and you can't make out the words,'' said Allen
Jacobi, the group's attorney.
   Broward County sheriff's deputies made the recording last month,
two days after U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez's ruled that their
lyrics were obscene.
   Assistant State Attorney Leslie Robson said the quality of the
recording was not great but it was clear enough to support the
court case.
   The group's fourth member, David Hobbs, has not been charged. He
serves as 2 Live Crew's ``disc jockey'' _ the member of a rap group
who plays records _ and does not have a role in vocalizing the
lyrics.

<TEXT>
   The chief military prosecutor has opened
investigations into the deaths of 11 people who were shot by East
German border guards as they attempted to flee to West Germany, the
state-run news agency reported today.
   But the prosecutor, Col. Karlheinz Boesel, said he would only
look into whether the guards were obeying orders, the ADN news
agency said.
   Since the Berlin Wall went up on Aug. 13, 1961, 192 people are
known to have died while trying to cross the heavily fortified
border in Berlin or between the two Germanys.
   Most were shot to death by East German border guards under the
notorious shoot-to-kill policy that was canceled only last year.
There have been widespread public demands that border guards be
prosecuted for the killings.
   Boesel said he would not act in any of the 192 cases unless
specific charges were pressed by the victims' relatives.
   He spoke in an interview scheduled to be broadcast this evening
by the West German ARD television network. ADN was quoting from an
advance text.
   ADN gave no details on any of the 11 cases being investigated,
except to say that relatives had filed murder or homicide charges.
   Border guards correctly obeying the shoot-to-kill order were
``no violent criminals,'' Boesel said.
   He argued for issuing ``some kind of exemption from prosecution
so that border troops who used their firearms in the line of duty
are offered a way out and a chance to make themselves known.''
   ADN said the shoot-to-kill order was issued in 1961 by Gen.
Heinz Hoffmann, who was East Germany's defense minister until his
death in 1985.
   Former Communist leader Erich Honecker is the target of an East
German murder probe stemming from the deaths of would-be escapees.
   The ADN report came two days after the final removal of all
existing border checks between the two German states. On Sunday,
the two nations took their biggest step yet toward unification by
merging their economies.

   The Energy Department said today it will cost
about $6 billion in each of the next five years to store and clean
up waste from nuclear weapons plants, nearly 50 percent more than
earlier was projected.
   The agency blamed the higher cost estimates primarily on the
discovery of additional wastes at DOE sites and stricter government
regulations that make the department and its contractors more
susceptible to lawsuits.
   It predicts that a doubling of cleanup staff may be necessary to
meet the goals of DOE's new five-year waste management plan through
1996.
   The revised five-year total through fiscal year 1995 will exceed
$28.6 billion, compared with the $19.5 billion DOE estimated six
months ago, according to a copy of the report summary made
available Monday by aides to Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.
   ``Such growth cannot now be managed responsibly and effectively,
given the inadequacy of the DOE, contractor, industry and regulator
infrastructure,'' the report said.
   ``Preliminary estimates indicate that DOE and its contractors
must increase staff to at least two and one-half times present
levels,'' it said.
   A key member of Congress said today he expected some increase in
the cost estimates.
   ``I always expect them to be higher, but that is a mighty big
difference between the estimate and the revised estimate,'' said
Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., chairman of the House Appropriations
Energy and Water subcommittee.
   Bevill said the new numbers will be closely scrutinized, but he
anticipates Congress will support efforts to dispose of nuclear
waste given the nation's growing environmental concerns.
   ``I think Congress will be very supportive of anything dealing
with the environment in this decade because our track record has
not been so good in the past and people are now starting to realize
it. We are not getting very far very fast. So far, we've just
talked about it,'' he said.
   Dicks said the new figures demonstrate a need to finance
research that will yield technology capable of disposing of the
waste in a cheaper way.
   The costs ``are going up, we expected that,'' said Paul Grimm,
assistant secretary for defense programs and director of the
department's environmental, safety and health coordination staff.
   ``The more remediation we do the more we find that is going to
have to be dealt with,'' he said in confirming totals mentioned in
the summary.
   ``Cost growth is to be expected as a normal consequence of this
process; however, the cost estimates used in developing this
(fiscal year) 1992-96 plan exceed what is considered a manageable
growth rate,'' the summary said.
   ``These amounts challenge and almost certainly exceed the
resources that can be brought to bear by DOE, its principal
contractors, the environmental restoration and waste management
industries and state and federal regulators.''
   Grimm said that in addition to new problems discovered at waste
sites, the increased costs are the result of stricter state and
federal regulations governing waste disposal and cleanup.
   ``Perhaps the most significant (and troubling) factor in driving
up cost estimates has been increased awareness of and exposure to
civil and criminal liabilities for DOE and contractor employees,''
the report said.
   Grimm said some costs are expected to decline in the future as
new technology uncovers cheaper ways to store and neutralize
radioactive waste.
   He said the new five-year plan through 1996 projects consecutive
annual spending of $5.9 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.8 billion, $6.3
billion and $6 billion, for a total of $31.4 billion.
   The projections are consistent with earlier estimates that it
would cost between $150 billion and $200 billion to clean up and
store wastes at nuclear weapons plants nationwide over the next 30
years, Grimm said.
   The report stipulated that the estimates include unvalidated
figures, but it concluded that the costs have ``increased
significantly'' since the last five-year plan was completed.
   ``I don't think anyone was really caught by surprise,'' said
George Behan, Dicks' press secretary.

   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the
Communist Party congress today that four senior party officials had
submitted their resignations, although they had not yet been
accepted.
   None of the names mentioned by Gorbachev was a major player at
the 28th Soviet Communist Party Congress, where the Soviet leader's
reform policies are under fire from hard-liners.
   The four included two members of the ruling Politburo, Nikolai
N. Slyunkov and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov; non-voting Politburo member
Alexandra Biryukova; and one member of the second-most powerful
body, Gumer I. Usmanov, who sits on the party secretariat.
   Slyunkov and Vorotnikov were two of 12 voting members of the
Politburo, and Biryukova was one of seven non-voting members.
   Gorbachev said that Slyunkov, 61, was very ill and in the
hospital. He had not attended the party session, which opened
Monday in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses.
   Gorbachev said that Usmanov, 58, also was resigning for health
reasons.
   He did not give reasons for the resignations submitted by
Vorotnikov, 64, and Biryukova, 61, although Vorotnikov recently
lost a job that carried nearly automatic inclusion on the
Politburo, that of president of the Russian Federation, the largest
Soviet republic.
   The office of the Russian presidency was drastically changed
this year, and Communist maverick Boris N. Yeltsin was elected to
the job on May 29. He is not a Politburo member.
   When Gorbachev announced Biryukova's name, there was a pause,
and a considerable hum of surprise among the delegates. Biryukova,
the only woman on the Politburo, was in charge of consumer goods.
   The shortage of consumer goods has been one of the main
complaints about Gorbachev's policies.
   Word of her resignation came the day after Gorbachev told the
congress he would like to see more women elected to senior party
positions.
   Gorbachev made the announcement reluctantly, after he was
pressed several times by delegates, who asked from the floor
whether rumors of impending Politburo resignations were correct.
   The resignations have not been accepted yet, said Gorbachev.
   ``I think we should deal with personnel questions after the
party's rules'' because they call for new positions and a new
structure in the party leadership, he said. One proposal would
rename the Politburo as the Presidium and expand the membership to
30.
   Asked whether any other Politburo members had submitted their
resignations, Gorbachev said, ``That's all so far.''
   Another Politburo member, Alexander Yakovlev, told The
Associated Press last week that he had submitted his resignation to
the secretariat when he was named to the Presidential Council, an
advisory board to Gorbachev. He did not indicate whether the
resignation had been accepted.
   Another Politburo member, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, told the
Congress on Tuesday he did not see any need for senior government
officials to sit on the Politburo.

   Rioting broke out in the Albanian
capital when hundreds of people tried to enter a foreign embassy,
and an unspecified number of people were wounded, the Albanian
government said today. The Greek government said there were reports
of deaths.
   Western diplomats said about 200 refugees had sought sanctuary
in foreign embassies since late last week in an apparent attempt to
flee Albania's repressive regime.
   A statement by the official Albanian news agency ATA said 300 to
400 people, including ``vagabonds, former prisoners ... as well as
some deceived adolescents,'' tried to enter a foreign embassy in
Tirana, the capital, Monday night.
   They clashed with ``forces of order,'' throwing stones, bricks
and breaking shop windows, and some people ``were slightly
wounded,'' it said.
   The Greek government released a statement saying: ``According to
other reports which have been impossible to confirm up to now,
shots were heard last night and it is rumored that there were
victims among the population.''
   The Albanian news agency said: ``With the immediate interference
of the forces of order and the working people of the capital, the
persons who violated order and tranquility dispersed. There were
slightly wounded on both parties.'' A number had been detained, it
said.
   The news agency called the disturbances ``alarming'' and said
they were aimed at distorting ``the image of Albania in the world.''
   A Western diplomat in Tirana, who spoke to The Associated Press
on condition of anonymity, said other Western diplomats told him of
rioting in central Tirana Monday night. ``I didn't see it myself
but I heard shouting and shots,'' the diplomat said.
   Earlier, a West German Foreign Ministry spokesman said 83
refugees were in the West German Embassy compound, and 60 to 80
others were scattered in other foreign embassies.
   The spokesman, Hanns Schumacher, would not specify which
embassies were involved. The West German Bild newspaper said they
included the embassies of Greece, Italy, Algeria and Egypt.
   A Western diplomat in Tirana, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said about 200 Albanians had sought refuge in at least
11 embassies.
   ``The wave started last week, especially on Thursday and Friday,
when 25 Albanians entered the Polish Embassy'' the diplomat said.
   He declined to say why so many Albanians had suddenly rushed to
the embassies.
   The incident was reminiscent of events last year in which East
Germans crowded Western embassies in Eastern Europe, triggering the
popular revolution in their country.
   Schumacher said one person was wounded in the leg late Sunday
night as Albanian guards fired at refugees at the West German
compound.
   Seventy-nine people fled into the compound Monday night and
early today; four sought refuge the night before, Schumacher said.
   He said the 79 refugees succeeded in entering the compound
either by climbing the wall or by breaking it down with a truck.
   ``In both cases, the Albanian security guards tried to hinder
them by using their weapons,'' the spokesman said.
   He said the refugees' motives were not clear, but he assumed
``this is the outbreak of dissatisfaction with the existing
political realities in Albania.''
   He added: ``Nobody will be expelled from the embassy against his
will.''
   The West German government summoned the Albanian ambassador to
the foreign office in Bonn today and formally protested ``the
brutal behavior' of the Albanian security guards, Schumacher said.
   The Foreign Ministry also set up a crisis task force, and
Schumacher said a meeting of the foreign policy arm of the European
Economic Community was scheduled for Wednesday in Brussels to
coordinate a response to the situation.
   ``The situation is extremely difficult,'' the Bild newspaper
quoted an unidentified West German embassy staff member on the
scene as saying. The report said the embassy apparently has been
ringed by members of the Albanian militia.
   Last August, Hungary opened its borders to the West and
thousands of East Germans began taking refuge in Western embassies
in Warsaw Pact nations or fleeing across the Hungarian border.
   East Germany eventually was forced to open its borders, and its
Communist government fell.
   Albania, a hard-line Stalinist state, has been vigorously
resisting the types of pro-democracy reforms that have been
sweeping other Eastern European countries.
   However, the Communist leadership has signaled some willingness
to increase foreign ties and grant citizens freedoms long denied
under the rigid regime imposed by the late leader Enver Hoxha.
   The Albanian state news agency ATA reported last month that
under new travel regulations, all Albanians age 16 and over would
be entitled to apply for a passport valid for five years.
   ATA had indicated the decree would take effect this month.
   Travel for Albania's 3 million citizens has been difficult, if
not impossible, for decades.
   Last month, Albania also pledged to adopt basic reforms and seek
full membership in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe. Albania is the only nation in Europe that refused to sign
the 1975 Helsinki agreements on security and human rights.
   Other moderate reforms announced in recent weeks had included
the abolition of the death penalty for those trying to flee the
country and the acceptance of religion, officially banned for
decades.
   Albanian leaders had also announced they were seeking to mend
relations with the superpowers.

   Nelson Mandela was put on the defensive today over
his calls for Britain to reverse its policy of refusing to
negotiate with the IRA.
   The black nationalist, trying to calm the uproar he created with
remarks in Ireland on Monday, insisted he was only promoting peace
_ not interfering in the Northern Ireland conflict.
   The controversy developed after Mandela, on an otherwise
triumphant 14-nation trip to promote his anti-apartheid efforts,
said in Dublin that the British government should negotiate with
the Irish Republican Army. British officials have refused to do so,
saying it is a terrorist group.
   The deputy president of the African National Congress has drawn
bipartisan British criticism over his comments. He was challenged
to clarify his statement today when he spoke to about 200 members
of Parliament at the House of Commons.
   Mandela's two-day visit to London, which began late Monday
night, was expected to focus on Britain's stand that European
sanctions on South Africa should be lifted to encourage the reforms
launched by President F.W. de Klerk.
   Instead, the IRA dispute has attracted the most attention. Both
the British and Irish governments oppose involving the outlawed IRA
in negotiations as long as it uses violence in its quest to end
British rule in Northern Ireland.
   ``I expressed no opinion whatsoever on the actual conflict
between the IRA and the British government,'' Mandela told today's
meeting of Parliament's all-party Southern Africa Committee.
   He said his group believes ``that all conflicts, wherever in the
world ... should be settled peacefully.''
   ``What is the use in the parties involved killing one another
and killing innocent civilians when they could sit down and address
their opponents by peaceful means?''
   Mandela's African National Congress is the leading group
challenging South Africa's white government and its racist system
of apartheid. The ANC has refused to renounce violence, but de
Klerk has opened talks with that group and others.
   Ivor Stanbrook of the governing Conservative Party introduced
Mandela today with words of praise but then chided him for
appearing to equate the IRA with the ANC.
   ``There is all the difference in the world between the struggle
of a liberating movement against an oppressive, despotic regime and
violence carried out for political ends in a parliamentary
democracy,'' Stanbrook said.
   However, several lawmakers greeted Stanbrook's remarks with
shouts of ``rubbish'' and ``disgrace.''
   Mandela then delivered a 25-minute speech appealing to Britons
to support international sanctions until there is ``irreversible
progress'' toward ending apartheid.
   South Africa's white government has launched a program to
dismantle some of the apartheid system of racial discrimination. De
Klerk also says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will
bring blacks into the national government but allow whites to
maintain veto power over major policy decisions. However, he
opposes the one-person, one-vote system the ANC is demanding.
   In his remarks to lawmakers, Mandela said he had tried to avoid
commenting on internal problems of the countries he visited during
his tour. He added he took great pains not to comment on racism
during his eight-city U.S. tour last month.
   Mandela, 71, was freed from prison earlier this year. He had
been jailed since 1962 and was serving a life term for sabotage and
plotting to overthrow the government.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who narrowly survived an IRA
bomb in 1984, was expected to defend Britain's policy barring talks
with the IRA during a meeting with Mandela on Thursday.
   However, the Thatcher-Mandela meeting will reflect a turnaround
in another British policy. Britain had refused with talk to the
ANC, branding it a terrorist group as well.

   Floods and landslides in four days of heavy rain
have killed 24 people and injured 26 others on Japan's southernmost
main island of Kyushu, the National Police Agency said Tuesday.
   Three others were missing, an agency official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Two were in Kumamoto, where more than 20
houses were washed away Monday by a swollen river and 14 people so
far have been found dead.
   Weather officials said 22.4 inches of rain had fallen in
Kumamoto between Friday and 6 a.m. Tuesday. An additional 2 inches
of rain was expected in parts of Kyushu because of a hovering storm.
   In Fukuoka, four people were killed, including three in a
landslide that crushed a home Monday, the official said. Two people
were killed in Saga and four in Oita.
   The official said about 660 local firefighters, joined by Ground
Self-Defense Force and police, were searching for the three missing
people.
   He said 208 houses were destroyed and 30,640 were flooded in
Kumamoto, Oita, Fukuoka, Saga, Nagasaki, Kagoshima and Miyazaki
prefectures on Kyushu.
   The landslides and flooding also forced railway officials to
cancel nearly 500 train runs scheduled Monday and Tuesday.

   An apparent security breach at the house being
built for the Duke and Duchess of York is under investigation,
Buckingham Palace said Tuesday.
   The Daily Mirror said a part-time security guard escorted a
reporter through the house in Sunninghill Park adjoining Windsor
Great Park, 22 miles west of London.
   It said the guard had approached the paper asking for a $12,000
payment in exchange for a tour of the house and security system.
The paper said it refused to pay him anything.
   The Mirror said the $9 million house included a bulletproof room
for emergencies, electronic monitors inside and outside, and alarm
buttons installed throughout.
   Queen Elizabeth II's second son, Prince Andrew, and his wife,
the former Sarah Ferguson, are expected to move into the two-story
house in October.
   ``The matter is being looked into. Obviously we don't discuss
security,'' said a Buckingham Palace spokesman, who was not named
in keeping with British custom.
   Carterton Security Services, which employed the guard who
allegedly gave the newspaper the tour, refused to comment on the
report.
   Thames Valley police, responsible for security at the house, and
Scotland Yard, which provides personal protection for the Duke and
Duchess, also refused to comment.

   Emperor Akihito wants Japanese to contribute to
charity or the environment rather than sending him coronation
gifts, and no gifts will be accepted from non-Japanese, officials
said Tuesday.
   Only certain Japanese may send gifts, and the type of item also
is limited, they added.
   Akihito, 56, who became emperor in January 1989 upon the death
of his father, Emperor Hirohito, is to be formally enthroned on
Nov. 12. The ceremony had to await the end of a yearlong formal
mourning period.
   An official of the Imperial Household Agency, which oversees
palace affairs, said many people had been reported hoping to send
coronation gifts.
   He noted, however, that Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto
declared after a regular Cabinet meeting Tuesday that the emperor
``appreciates the desire of people to offer presents, but he
strongly wishes contributions to the promotion of public welfare
and maintenance of a green environment instead.''
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said gifts
will be accepted only from the Cabinet, the two houses of
Parliament, local governments and groups of Japanese living abroad.
Gifts will not be accepted from any foreigners or foreign
governments.
   Unacceptable gifts, he said, would include high-priced items,
gold, silver, cash, bonds, antiques and family treasures, daily
necessities, swords, guns, food and drink, animals and plants.
   The gifts will be accepted between Nov. 1 and Dec. 20, the
official said.

   Ten people convicted of robbery, rape and murder
were publicly sentenced and immediately executed in the northeast
Chinese city of Dalian, an official report said.
   The report by Liaoning provincial radio of last Wednesday's
rally was carried by the British Broadcasting Co. monitering
service, seen in Beijing on Tuesday.
   Those executed included a 25-year-old man who had previously
been imprisoned for hooliganism. After his release, he burned
several cars in the Xinjin county government office, causing $8,454
in damage. The report did not say why he committed the arson.
   It was the latest in a recent spate of reports of public
sentencings and executions reflecting an anti-crime campaign
launched in late May.
   China periodically cracks down on crime before major events like
Chinese New Year and the annual meeting of the national
legislature. The latest anti-crime campaign comes just months
before Beijing welcomes the 11th Asian Games.

   Conservatives mounted a counteroffensive against
some of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms today at a crucial Communist
Party congress that could help determine the fate of the Soviet
president's ambitious program.
   Hard-line Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev won thunderous
applause from the 4,567 delegates at the 28th party congress when
he angrily denounced what he described as a media campaign against
conservative party members and their allies in the military.
   ``In our day, there are forces going against socialism and the
Communist Party ... and they have great influence in the mass
media,'' Ligachev said.
   Gorbachev, who is general secretary of the party, sat
stone-faced as Ligachev and other conservatives criticized reforms
that they said were weakening the authority of the party.
   The session was broadcast nationally after an eight-hour delay.
Monday's congress opening was broadcast live.
   Ligachev, leading the conservatives' attack, was followed to the
podium by two other prominent conservatives, KGB chairman Vladimir
A. Kryuchkov and Defense Minister Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov.
   A Gorbachev ally, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
answered with a strong defense of reform, or perestroika, and of
Gorbachev's efforts to shift power from the party to government and
legislative bodies.
   Shevardnadze, who has been the point man in arms deals with the
United States, fended off criticism of ``concessions in the
security arena.''
   ``Squandering a quarter of our budget on military expenditures,
we have ruined the country,'' he said. ``We shall have no need for
defense, because a ruined country and an impoverished people have
no need for an army.''
   He praised Soviet policy toward Eastern Europe, where since last
August new, more democratic governments have replaced what he
called ``totalitarian regimes that had been imposed on them and
were alien to them.''
   ``We forecast this. We sensed that if there were not changes,
there would be tragedy,'' he said.
   In a remark that ran counter to Soviet tradition, Shevardandaze
said he did not see why the foreign minister should also sit on the
Politburo, the top party body consisting of 12 voting and seven
non-voting members.
   Shevardnadze was applauded, but not nearly as much as Ligachev,
who later told reporters that the loss of Eastern Europe ``doesn't
strengthen our position, but weakens it.''
   Yazov, wearing his green marshal's uniform emblazoned with
several rows of medals, sharply opposed calls by progressive
Communists to eliminate party cells in the Soviet armed forces.
   ``That would be very harmful,'' he told the delegates, including
some military officers.
   Kryuchkov urged Communists, in their search for new political
ideas, not to ape the West, which he said was plagued by
materialism, crime, drug use and high unemployment.
   ``Very recently it was written here that in the West everything
was bad and here everything was good,'' Kryuchkov said. ``Now we
hear assertions that in the West everything is good and here
everything is bad.''
   None of the conservatives criticized Gorbachev by name, but they
attacked some of his policies.
   Ligachev harshly criticized three of Gorbachev's programs: the
anti-alcoholism campaign that has since been abandoned and two
emerging policies, private ownership of factories and a move toward
private ownership of land.
   Ligachev has been mentioned as a possible challenger to
Gorbachev when the 28th party congress elects the party leader.
   He refused to say today whether he would be a candidate, but he
has said Gorbachev should not hold the top party job and the
country's presidency at the same time.
   Ligachev received strong applause when he charged that putting
factories in private hands will not help socialism. But the
audience was quiet when he said, ``Communal land unites, while
private property separates the interests of the people.''
   Two weeks ago, Ligachev said Gorbachev should not hold the top
job in the party and the presidency at the same time.
   But he received a restrained final ovation, perhaps reflecting
the sentiment that Gorbachev retain both posts.
   The congress has the power to elected a new Central Committee,
and major changes are expected in the personnel and structure of
the Politbuo. Those changes began to emerge during the afternoon
session, when Gorbachev announced that four senior party officials
had submitted their resignations.
   None of the resignations had been accepted, he said.
   The four included two full members of the ruling Politburo,
Nikolai N. Slyunkov and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov; non-voting Politburo
member Alexandra Biryukova; and one member of the second most
powerful body, Gumer I. Usmanov, who sits on the party secretariat.
They have not been major players at the congress.
   Slyunkov and Vorotnikov were two of 12 voting members of the
Politburo, and Biryukova was one of seven non-voting members.

<TEXT>
   Snooky Lanson, singing star of the
popular 1950s show ``Your Hit Parade,'' has died at the age of 76.
   Lanson died Monday night at Saint Thomas Hospital, according to
the Martin's &amp; Bracey-Welsh Funeral Home. The cause of death was
not released.
   Lanson sang on the show from 1950 to 1957 as a replacement for
Frank Sinatra. The TV version of the legendary radio ``Lucky Strike
Hit Parade,'' the show counted down the top tunes of the week and
featured ``extras.''
   The show was a forerunner to today's ``countdown'' radio and
music video programs.
   After Lanson and other regulars on the Saturday night show were
dropped from the cast in 1957, he sang in nightclubs and was host
of TV variety shows in Atlanta and in Shreveport, La. The show
continued until 1959 and was revived briefly in 1974.
   ``The show didn't have any stars per se and we all got along
well,'' Lanson recalled in a 1979 interview with The Associated
Press. ``It was very clean and there was no suggestive dancing. A
5- or 6-year-old could watch it. And of course a lot of people
watched it to see what song was No. 1 that week.''
   Among the songs Lanson sang were ``Ebb Tide,'' ``He'' and ``Mr.
Sandman.''
   ``I sang `Mona Lisa' 13 straight weeks because it was a man's
song and I was the only man on the show then,'' Lanson said.
   Lanson also said he was lucky to have been on the hit program.
   ``I have no illusions of grandeur,'' he said in 1979. ``I know
that 99 percent of the singers roaming the country then were better
than me.
   ``I know my time has come and gone. I had my time.''
   He had lived in Nashville since 1967 where he sang at tea dances
and similar functions. He also had a syndicated radio show that
played ``big band'' music and sold cars and outdoor advertising.
   In 1941, he recorded the hit record ``By the Light of the
Silvery Moon'' with the Ray Noble Band. A later hit, ``The Old
Master Painter,'' helped him land the ``Hit Parade'' job.
   He was born Roy Landman in Memphis and began singing in a church
choir there as a boy. He was nicknamed ``Snooky'' at age 2 for the
Irving Berlin tune ``Snooky-Ookums.''
   Survivors include his wife, Florence; a daughter; two sons; and
eight grandchildren.

<HEAD>After Acquittal, Just Another Subway Ride</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the trial ended with his acquittal, Adnan
Khashoggi did what he's done every day since it began last March:
He took the subway home.
   Smiling broadly, surrounded by family and aides, the man once
considered the world's richest person led a pack of photographers
down the stairs, plunked a token in the turnstile, and boarded the
No. 6 local for the ride uptown.
   Minutes earlier, on the steps of Manhattan's federal courthouse
where he and former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos had just
been acquitted of all charges, Khashoggi told reporters:
   ``I am very happy for myself, I am happy for my family. and I am
happy for America. With your system of justice, you should be very
proud of yourselves.''
   Khashoggi, 54, had been accused of obstructing justice and mail
fraud by faking documents to help Mrs. Marcos and her late husband
conceal their ownership of four New York office buildings and some
paintings after a 1986 court order froze their assets.
   Throughout the three-month trial he told reporters, well wishers
and anyone who would listen that he had done nothing wrong and
trusted the American jury system to clear up the misunderstanding.
   ``But this woman,'' he would say, referring to his co-defendant.
``She is sick, and why are they treating her like this?''
   Short, portly and balding, Khashoggi looks like the consummate
middle man that he has been for more than 30 years _ bringing
together people who need something with those who have it, and
taking his cut for services rendered.
   In that role he built an investment portfolio that once reached
into 35 countries and earned him $80 million to $100 million a
year. Although business setbacks have shrunk that empire and
slightly crimped his jet-set lifestyle in recent years, he still
has homes and offices in his native Saudi Arabia, and in France,
Switzerland, Britain and the United States, a private DC-8 and a
yacht.
   A devout Moslem who only occasionally sips wine, he loves night
life and is likely to turn up in the local hot spots whenever he
travels.
   In the late 1980s he came under fire for his go-between role in
the Iran-Contra affair, in which the Reagan adminstration secretly
sold weapons to Iran and diverted the funds to the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   But Khashoggi insists that everything he did had the approval of
the U.S. and Saudi governments.
   Although he is acquainted with presidents and kings _ King Fahd
of Saudi Arabian guaranteed the $10 million bond that got him
released from a New York jail _ intimates say that Khashoggi
retains a generous nature and common touch.
   One friend, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Khashoggi
once wrote a check for a distant relative who needed money, and
after the recipient doctored the check to increase the amount,
Khashoggi instructed the bank to cash it anyway.
   James Linn, Khashoggi's attorney, said his client rode the
subway to the trial because he had a habit of being late and it was
faster than a limousine.
   Riding uptown on Monday, Khashoggi sat between his son, Hussein,
and his daughter Nabila, posing for photographers and signing
autographs for other riders.
   And later, as his entourage of 25 trooped across town toward his
apartment at Olympic Towers, Adnan Khashoggi took a cellular phone
from his pocket and began calling the good news to relatives and
friends in London, Paris and Santa Barbara, Calif.

   A man already in custody for auto theft has been
charged with killing a Soviet cardiologist on vacation in New York,
police said.
   Eric Wilson, 22, of Brooklyn, was ordered held without bail
after his arraignment Sunday night on charges he fatally shot Dr.
Arkady Novikov, said police spokesman Sgt. Nick Vreeland.
   Novikov, 47, of Moscow, was shot to death in the early morning
hours of June 24 while trying to protect his wife from a gunman who
tried to steal her purse in an apartment building lobby in the
Forest Hills section of Queens.
   Wilson was caught fleeing from a stolen car in Brooklyn 16 hours
after the slaying, authorities said. Jewelry that belonged to
Novikov's wife, Galina, was recovered from the car, as were a
sawed-off .30-caliber rifle and ammunition, Vreeland said.
Ballistic tests have linked the weapon to Novikov's slaying, he
said.
   Wilson's alleged accomplice in the slaying was still being
sought, according to Vreeland.

   The National Assembly voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to replace the Marxist state emblem with
Hungary's traditional coat of arms. Lawmakers then burst into a
spontaneous singing of the national anthem.
   It was the nation's latest move to erase the legacy of four
decades of Communist rule.
   Of the 386 legislators, 258 voted in favor, 28 against, 35
abstained and the rest were absent.
   There was considerable debate over two versions, with and
without the crown of St. Stephen, the king who ruled between 997
and 1038. Ultimately, the version with the crown was approved.
   The largest opposition party, the League of Free Democrats,
expressed fears that neighboring countries could misinterpret a
national emblem containing the crown because the same coat of arms
was used by the rightist prewar regime of Admiral Nicholas Horthy.
   Supporters of the crown argued that it was the symbol of
Hungarian statehood. It was King Stephen who welded the Hungarian
tribes into a nation and christianized the people.

   Bensonhurst racial attack defendant John Vento
was found innocent this morning of one count of murder, but the
sharply divided jury could not reach a verdict on a second murder
charge against him.
   The jury, which was in its ninth day of deliberations, convicted
Vento of two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of
menacing for his role in the attack which left 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins dead on a Brooklyn sidewalk.
   Vento, who backed out of a deal to testify against his
co-defendants in the case, faces one and one-third to four years on
the unlawful imprisonment counts and 90 days on each menacing
count. Sentencing was set for Aug. 14.
   The 21-year-old sat silently as the verdicts were read.
   Vento was acquitted of the first murder count; a weapons
possession charge; one count of unlawful imprisonment; and five
counts of discrimination. The jury was also was hung on a count of
first-degree riot.
   Prosecutors said Vento would be retried in September on the
charges for which there was a hung jury.
   The Vento case was the second trial stemming from the attack by
a white gang on Hawkins, who was shot and killed in the
predominantly white neighborhood last year. Hawkins was in the area
to look at a used car.
   The first trial, actually two trials held simultaneously with
separate juries, resulted in a murder conviction against Joseph
Fama, 19, and a conviction on lesser charges against Keith
Mondello, also 19.
   State Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus Owens, who also presided
over the earlier trials, told the jurors judging Vento's case that
he knew it was not an easy case to decide.
   ``I can understand your chagrin, and I can also understand your
anguish,'' Owens told the panel before dismissing them.
   Hawkins, a black high school student, was fatally shot last Aug.
23 as he and three friends walked through the south Brooklyn
neighborhood of Bensonhurst. The four blacks crossed paths with a
gang of bat-wielding whites, which Vento allegedly helped organize.
   The attack was widely viewed as one of the worst racial
incidents in New York in years. The murder was a shock for a city
trying to heal from the wounds of the racial killing in another
predominantly white neighborhood, Howard Beach, as well as
allegations of police attacks on blacks and other racially charged
incidents in the late 1980s.
   Fama, named as the triggerman by several of the defendants, was
sentenced to 32 and two-thirds years to life. Ringleader Mondello,
19, was acquitted of homicide charges but sentenced to five and
one-third to 16 years in prison for his other convictions.
   Five other young Bensonhurst whites accused of being part of the
mob are to stand trial later.
   The day after Hawkins' murder, Vento fled upstate, but he soon
called prosecutors to admit his role. He also agreed to cooperate
in the investigation and to testify against his friends in exchange
for immunity from prosecution.
   When he appeared before a grand jury in September, Vento gave a
complete and graphic account of the attack. He said he watched from
just several feet away as Fama pulled an automatic pistol and fired
into Hawkins' chest.
   Vento told of seeing the ``sparks coming out of the gun, pop,
the fire.'' As Hawkins collapsed to the sidewalk fatally wounded,
the whites ran without stopping to help him.
   Around Christmas, with the scheduled start of the first
Bensonhurst trial a little more than two months away, Vento again
fled the city. He surrendered to FBI agents in Dayton, Ohio, in
March, but announced he would no longer cooperate. He was indicted
by a grand jury a week later.
   While there's no evidence Vento even touched a gun the night of
shooting prosecutors accused him of being a key player who helped
his friend Mondello call together the gang.
   ``Like a good general, John Vento marshals his troops just
before the fray,'' assistant district attorney Martin Hershey said
in his final arguments.
   Vento was as guilty of murder as the shooter, prosecutors
charged, because he continued to pursue the blacks after hearing
Fama say he was going to shoot one of them.
   But defense lawyer Gerald DiChiara said Fama acted independently
and without warning in killing Hawkins. He also accused prosecutors
of creating a racial issue for political purposes and going after
Vento out of vengeance because he reneged on his agreement to
testify against the others.

<HEAD>Navy Ready to Evacuate Americans, Possibly Doe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy task force was standing ``over the
horizon'' off Liberia today ready to evacuate Americans or Liberian
President Samuel Doe if requested to do so by the State Department
in the wake of renewed fighting, the Pentagon said.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said the Navy ships
sent to the area May 31 were ``still in international waters, over
the horizon'' from the coast of the troubled West African nation.
   Williams said about 800 Americans, including 70 embassy
personnel, remained in the Liberian capital of Monrovia.
   Rebels attacked Monrovia on Monday in a two-pronged offensive
that cut all major land routes from the capital, according to a
pool report filed by journalists there.
   The Pentagon spokesman said the primary purpose of the Navy
ships, which have about 2,500 sailors and Marines on board, is to
evacuate Americans if needed.
   The State Department advised U.S. citizens on May 31 to leave
Liberia because of deteriorating conditions, and some departed on
chartered airline flights last month.
   In response to a question about possible evacuation of Doe,
Williams said, ``If the State Department were to ask us to assist
in moving President Doe, we would certainly be prepared to do what
they asked us.''
   The State Department has said it is prepared to help Doe depart
the country if he so requests.
   A rebel source in Ivory Coast, across the border from Liberia,
said today that several thousand rebel troops were approaching
Monrovia to ``put an end'' to Doe.
   The United States and other governments have urged Doe to resign
and leave the country, a condition the rebels have set for
accepting a cease-fire.
   Several countries have offered Doe asylum, including Nigeria and
Togo. Doe, 40, a former master sergeant, has ruled Liberia since a
bloody coup in April 1980. He ousted the descendants of freed
American slaves who had ruled the West African country for more
than a century.
   Bush ordered the amphibious task force to the area on May 31. It
is made up of the amphibious assault ship USS Saipan and the
supporting ships USS ponce, USS Sumter and USS Peterson. The ships
arrived off the coast June 3.
   The Navy said the Saipan's secondary missions include being
ready to evacuate civilians or delivering supplies to victims of
natural disaster. It carries enough supplies to sustain 500
evacuees for 10 days, the Navy said.

   Some fuzzy images from the Hubble Space
Telescope may be improved through the same computer process that
cleaned up photos taken by the Voyager spacecraft. But the pictures
will still be less clear than originally expected, a scientist said
today.
   Ed Weiler, a Hubble project scientist, said a team of experts
was being selected to determine how much of the ``fuzz ball'' now
being seen by the space telescope can be turned into crisp pictures
through computer techniques.
   Improving poor pictures through computers, Weiler told a news
conference, is ``something of a black art,'' but experts in the
field believe some Hubble views, such as those of bright objects,
can be improved.
   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' Weiler told a news
conference. ``We'll let the experts play with the images. People in
the field say there is a lot of hope there.''
   Weiler emphasized, however, that the computer-enhancing
technique is only an effort to salvage some good from a
fundamentally flawed telescope.
   ``This is not a cure-all for the problem,'' he said, noting that
the picture computer processing would recover less than 50 percent
of the visual photo science that was expected from the $1.5 billion
telescope.
   Hubble's basic problem is that a mistake was made in the
grinding and polishing of either the primary or the secondary
mirror on the telescope. Weiler said one of the reflecting surfaces
was not cut to the correct prescription and, as a result, the two
mirrors do not work together properly.
   The result is a fuzzy view of the universe from the telescope.
   Lennard Fisk, chief scientist for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, said on Monday that the computer enhanced
photos from Hubble would be so good that ``you are all going to be
delighted with the kind of results that the telescope produces in
the next few years.''
   NASA engineers, meanwhile, stepped up tests designed to find and
isolate a hydrogen leak that has grounded the nation's three space
shuttles.
   Helium under 30 pounds of pressure was forced into the hydrogen
rocket fuel system of space shuttle Atlantis as it sat Monday on a
launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center. A similar test, using
supercold liquid hydrogen, revealed a leak last week.
   Plumbing and valves from Columbia, which was grounded last month
when a hydrogen leak was found, are now being tested at the shuttle
manufacturer's plant in California.
   Engineers hope the tests will pinpoint precisely how the
hydrogen leaks from the shuttle and fuel tank while the supercold
liquid rocket fuel is being loaded. The leaks, occurring within
weeks of each other from the same area of two different shuttles,
led NASA last Friday to ground the fleet until the problem is
corrected.
   Fisk said the Hubble focusing problem is absolutely consistent
and that this reliable symmetry will enable scientists to correct
the fuzzy view through a computer program.
   ``There is growing optimism that because of the nature of the
signal ... that we will be able to do image reconstruction ... and
produce clear, exciting views of the universe,'' he said.
   Such techniques were used at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to
improve the quality of pictures returned from the two Voyager
spacecraft that explored the outer planets and radioed views back
to Earth.
   ``If you've seen pictures from Voyager you know how capable we
are of doing image reconstruction when the signals are not
precisely in the focus that you want,'' said Fisk. ``I think you
will discover that Hubble in its current capability produces
exciting and very dramatic pictures of the universe.''
   Engineers learned last week that one of the two main mirrors f
the $1.5 billion space telescope contained a manufactured flaw that
kept the telescope from seeing the universe clearly. The Hubble, in
effect, is like a person who needs glasses and is trying to see the
world without them.
   Fisk said the true focus of the Hubble view is missed by a tiny
measure _ about one-fiftieth of the width of a human hair _ and
that this makes the flaw easier to correct.
   ``Six months from now, a year from now, I expect you all to ooh
and ahh over the picture that Hubble is going to produce and of
course, compliment the current management of NASA for their success
in pulling it off,'' he told reporters.
   At the same news conference, NASA space flight director William
B. Lenoir said the space shuttle mystery leak must be solved within
a few weeks to keep the agency anywhre near its ambitious flight
schedule.
   Columbia's leak forced postponement of an astronomy mission in
May and Atlantis' leak is delaying a secret military mission.
Columbia had been scheduled to fly twice more this year and
Atlantis once more.
   The third shuttle, Discovery, must be launched in October to
take advantage of a planetary alignment that occurs only once every
two years. The shuttle's cargo is the Ulysses science probe that is
to study the sun.
   Lenoir said tests now under way may provide answers to the leak
problem by Thursday and allow the agency to re-establish a launch
schedule.

   Two male-only eating clubs at Princeton
University discriminate against women and must open their
membership to females, the state Supreme Court ruled today.
   The high court ruled unanimously in an 11-year-old sex
discrimination case brought by Sally Frank, a former Princeton
University student who is now a law professor at New York Law
School in New York City.
   The court rejected the clubs' argument that men-only clubs are
permitted as long as they sever their relationship with the Ivy
League university.
   ``I'm really thrilled,'' Ms. Frank said from Washington, D.C.
``I'm glad that the court decided to stop discrimination at
Princeton.''
   Lawyers for the eating clubs could not be immediately reached
for comment.
   Ms. Frank's suit was against the Ivy Club and the Tiger Inn, the
only two among the university's 13 private eating clubs that
exclude women. Princeton began admitting women in 1969.
   Earlier this year, the two clubs voted to admit women, but two
more rounds of voting must be conducted next year before women can
join. Most juniors and seniors eat at the clubs, housed near the
Princeton campus.
   ``It is undisputed that the clubs had a general policy that
excluded females from consideration as members,'' the high court
said. ``It is also undisputed that the clubs applied this policy to
Frank'' when she tried to join the clubs.
   In arguing the case before the Supreme Court, attorneys for the
two clubs had maintained that the clubs were private and not part
of Princeton University. They said that gave the clubs the right to
choose their membership.
   But Ms. Frank argued that the university has promoted the clubs
in its publications, and added that Princeton has relied on them
since more than 75 percent of the upperclassmen at the school eat
at the clubs.
   The Supreme Court ruling upheld a 1987 decision by the New
Jersey Division on Civil Rights which ordered the clubs to begin
admitting women. That decision had been overturned by the Appellate
Division of Superior Court, which granted the clubs' request for a
new hearing because of prodecural errors.
   But the Supreme Court said the clubs had already been afforded
their administrative due process and it did not see any disputed
facts.
   Frank had sued a third eating club but that club began admitting
women in 1986 and settled with Ms. Frank for $20,000. The
university was also named in the suit but also settled in 1986,
paying Ms. Frank $27,500 in legal fees and pledging to dissociate
itself from sexually segregated clubs.
   Ms. Frank said she pursued the case because its outcome has
implications beyond Princeton.
   ``For better or for worse, people who graduate from Princeton
tend to take positions in leadership,'' Ms. Frank said. ``If they
learn while they are students at Princeton that discrimination is
acceptable then they are going to take that lesson with them. I
don't want them to learn that lesson.''

<HEAD>Bush Says He'll Discuss Changes in NATO Nuclear Strategy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that he
would discuss a proposal to use NATO nuclear forces only as a last
resort when the allies meet in London later this week.
   Bush refused to confirm that the United States was offering such
a proposal. But when asked about reports that a change in nuclear
strategy was on the agenda, he said, ``I'm ready to discuss that
with them.''
   ``As things change we want to be sure that evrybody understands
that NATO is the stabilizing factor that we think it should be and
will be,'' he told reporters after meeting with top advisers at his
seaside vacation home.
   Continuing the pre-summit talks with allied leaders in advance
of the NATO, Bush said that he had talked this morning to the prime
ministers of Denmark and Belgium.
   He said he didn't talk to them about the matter of NATO's
so-called flexible response strategy of using nuclear weapons in a
mix with conventional arms.
   ``I didn't go into that specific,'' he said. ``But I think the
general approach that we're proposing seems to be getting wide
acceptance.''
   He said he wants to underscore that a unified Germany belonging
to NATO is not a threat to the Soviet Union.
   ``If there are certain things that we can do to expand NATO's
role that drives that point home, so much the better,'' he said.
   In a briefing with top aides and Cabinet members today, Bush
shifted gears from the NATO meeting to next week's economic summit
of seven industrialized nations.
   Bush said ``we're in good shape for that meeting,'' and that
trade issues would be particularly prominent.
   He said he also expected a ``good discussion of the
environment,'' and that he would continue to reject U.S.
participation in economic aid programs for the Soviet Union until
it reforms its own market practices and halts aid to Marxist Cuba.
   Bush spent much of Monday preparing for the two-day NATO summit
meeting in London, which begins Thursday.
   Bush said after a briefing session with Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Vice President Dan
Quayle and others, that ``we're in pretty good shape on it now.''
   According to administration officials, Bush intends to urge the
allies to overhaul the NATO defense strategy by using nuclear
weapons only as a last resort in a war situation.
   Bush also is ready to consider scrapping the 1,470 U.S.
nuclear-tipped artillery shells now based mostly in West Germany
and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1,560 U.S. nuclear bombs
deployed in seven NATO countries, the officials told The Associated
Press.
   He said Monday before setting out to play golf with Quayle that,
``there will be some very interesting developments'' at the NATO
meeting this week, but nothing he considers of ``bombshell
dimension.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters that
arms control issues will be on the agenda in London.
   The administration intends to propose that the allies eliminate
nuclear stockpiles, including artillery shells now deployed in West
Germany, from Europe if the Soviets completely withdraw their
troops from foreign soil, according to administration officials who
insisted on anonymity.
   Today's session included Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
Trade Representative Carla Hills, Quayle and other officials who
are preparing for the economic summit July 9-11.
   The participants intended to review with Bush the draft
communique they want to issue at the end of the economic summit. It
has been prepared in consultations with the other participating
nations.
   Among the topics they will prepare is how to address the matter
of Western economic aid to help the Soviet Union's flagging
economy. Bush has said he is not particularly interested in that
idea, but has no objections if the other nations want to help.
   Leaders of the 12-member European Community already have agreed
in principle to provide some form of financial help to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev on the basis that his efforts to reform
his economy help the Western world as well.
   Bush told reporters last week he has a hard time seeing large
aid packages going to the Soviet Union ``when they're spending 18
percent of their gross national product on military and when
they're spending an estimated $5 billion (annually) in Cuba?''
   Bush and his aides today also were to discuss prospects for
environmental agreements at the economic summit.
   Several European nations have committed themselves to reducing
or stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the decade to
cut down on the global warming trend.
   The Bush administration has maintained that more research is
needed on the warming of the earth before taking such measures.
   Also up for possible discussion on the environmental front is
how to deal with worldwide deforestation and the destruction of
tropical rain forests due to development.
   Bush is spending a six-day long holiday weekend at his Maine
vacation home before departing Wednesday night for London.
   He was to watch early fireworks tonight from a Coast Guard
cutter offshore from his Walker's Point home.

<HEAD>May Contain Remains of 40,000 Communist Victims, Newspaper Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mass grave discovered last week in
northern Yugoslavia may contain the remains of 40,000 people
executed by victorious Communists in 1945, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
   Most appear to have been Ustasha soldiers of the defeated Nazi
puppet state of Croatia, Vjesnik said.
   The victims apparently were executed after surrendering to
Communist partisans or being deported to Yugoslavia by the Western
allies from Austria, where many had sought refuge at the end of
World War II.
   The Ustashas were an elite, SS-type military unit accused of
murdering hundreds of thousands of Jews, Serbs and Gypsies after
the so-called Independent State of Croatia was created under German
auspices in 1941.
   Piles of bones, estimated to be up to 10 yards deep in places,
were found in a 40-yard-long pit near the village of Sosice, about
45 miles west of the Croatian capital of Zagreb.
   The Vjesnik story was illustrated with large photographs of a
cave at the bottom of the pit filled with skulls and human bones.
   Townspeople and former partisans quoted by the daily said that
truckloads of wounded Croatian soldiers, members of the Ustasha
youth movement, army nurses and other people were brought to the
site. They then were shot and thrown one by one into the narrow pit.
   Earlier reports had estimated the dead in the thousands but the
Vjesnik account was the first to put a possible figure on remains
in the grave. While not clarifying how it arrived at 40,000
victims, Vjesnik quoted townspeople as saying that for months
trucks loaded with captives drove toward the pit and returned empty.
   A center-right party, the Croatian Democratic Union, assumed
power in Croatia last month after trouncing the ruling Communists
in the first multiparty elections in 45 years.
   Authorities are investigating reports of mass executions at
several sites in 1945 of Ustashas and Chetniks, royalist guerrillas
who fought both the Germans and the Communists in a three-sided war.

   Alaska officials angrily rejected an
environmental group's call for more federal restrictions to protect
the state's wilderness.
   The Wilderness Society issued a report Monday that called the
decade-old Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act a
``great disappointment.'' It accused the Bush administration of
putting development interests ahead of the act's mandate to protect
wildlife.
   The report proposed congressional hearings, a ban on oil and gas
exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and passage of
federal oil-spill legislation.
   ``From what I've seen of it, this report appears to be a cursory
look by people who don't live in Alaska at a law which Alaskans
have to live with every day,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said.
   ``We appreciate the Wilderness Society joining the call for
federal oil-spill legislation. But we don't agree that the federal
government needs to be even more involved in the lives of
Alaskans.''
   When the act was signed into law by President Carter in 1980, it
was praised by environmentalists as one of the most ambitious
preservation laws ever. It set aside 104.3 million acres of
national parks, wildlife refuges and other protected areas in the
nation's largest state.
   The report also urged a permanent federal takeover of fish and
game management on Alaska's public lands.
   It was released one day after Washington took over game
management on all federally owned land in Alaska _ two-thirds of
the state. The takeover resulted from a conflict between state law
and the federal act, which required the state to give rural
Alaskans priority for subsistence use of fish and game.
   ``I'm not surprised by any of the allegations by this
organization,'' said Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska.
   ``They want more wilderness, more federal enforcement of
regulations as they interpret the laws, more restrictions on every
type of land use,'' he said. ``The only thing these environmental
elitists want less of is access by Alaskans to federal lands.''
   The report says oil development in the refuge and logging in the
Tongass National Forest are the most serious threats to Alaska's
public lands. The group wants Congress to designate the refuge a
wilderness to prevent development.
   The refuge, in the state's remote northeastern corner, includes
a coastal plain oil companies see as a potential source of oil to
replace the diminishing flow from Alaska's huge Prudhoe Bay field.
Congress was considering authorizing further exploration and
development there before the Exxon Valdez oil spill last year.

   Rasheeda Moore, who participated in an FBI
sting against Mayor Marion Barry, testified today that she lost a
city contract in 1988 because she refused his request for a sexual
favor.
   Testifying for the fifth day at the mayor's drug and perjury
trial, Moore said that when she rejected Barry's overture, he said,
``you refuse, therefore you refuse the contract.''
   Moore testified that in 1986, when she was romantically involved
with Barry, her city contract for a summer youth program was
approved speedily ``after the mayor told me it would be.''
   The city spent more than $180,000 on ``Project Me,'' a modeling
program designed by Moore to build self-esteem.
   But in 1988, just after her affair with Barry had ended, she
went to a room at the Vista Hotel where she met with Barry and
another woman, Maria McCarthy, Moore testified.
   ``Mr. Barry suggested I put Maria McCarthy in charge of the
administrative end'' of Project Me, Moore said in response to
questions by assistant U.S. attorney Judith Retchin.
   ``We were using drugs,'' testified Moore. After McCarthy left,
Barry asked Moore to join him.
   ``Was there a sexual request?'' said Retchin.
   ``Yes,'' Moore said on re-direct examination by the prosecution.
   ``Did you comply?'' asked Retchin.
   ``No,'' said Moore.
   Barry at that point said ``you refuse, therefore you refuse the
contract,'' Moore testified.
   She said that Barry told her that ``because I refused'' his
request for a sexual favor, he would be unable to ``promise (her)
the contract this year.
   The program was not renewed.
   Moore's testimony about the contract followed her
cross-examination by Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, that began
last Thursday.
   Mundy said Moore, who participated in an FBI sting against the
mayor, has received more than $32,000 in government aid. He
suggested she may be lying for the FBI.
   Moore testified she and Barry had used drugs together more than
100 times, but ``can you give me a month, a day and a year for ...
these ... episodes?'' asked Mundy.
   ``Tell us a date that you're positive of,'' he challenged. Mundy
suggested Moore was being vague about dates of the alleged drug use
because she is afraid the defense will find that she is giving
perjured testimony.
   Barry travels a lot and Moore is ``concerned that he was not
even in town'' on days when she said the two used drugs together in
Washington, said Mundy.
   ``No, I am not,'' said Moore.
   The mayor has ``a very busy schedule, being out of town and
being on trips and is that a reason you cannot be more precise?''
asked Mundy.
   ``No,'' insisted Moore. She said, as she has since last Thursday
when her cross-examination began, that she is just ``not good with
dates.''
   Mundy maintained that Moore, who is in the government's witness
protection program, has received $32,000 from the government since
January.
   ``I haven't,'' said Moore.
   But she said the FBI paid for her and her three children to come
to Washington, put her up in hotels and paid for her clothes. She
said she ``has no idea'' how much the government has spent on her.
   On Monday, Barry's lawyer said Moore provided ``the pipe ... the
light and the know-how'' for Barry to use crack. He made the
assertion as he replayed at the trial a videotape of the FBI sting.
   Barry's lawyer is using the government's videotaped evidence in
an attempt to show that the mayor was entrapped by the FBI into
smoking crack cocaine.
   The tape was first played publicly last week by the prosecution.
It pertains to one of the 10 misdemeanor charges accusing Barry of
cocaine possession. He also is accused of conspiracy and three
counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his involvement with
drugs.
   Barry seven times declined Moore's offer to use drugs during the
sting, Mundy said as he went over the transcript of the Jan. 18
hotel room meeting between the mayor and Moore.
   ``You provided the encouragement by bringing the subject up ad
nauseam,'' Mundy told Moore, a former Barry girlfriend.
   Moore didn't deny Mundy's suggestion that she kept bringing up
the subject of drugs. But she said Barry readily engaged in
discussing drugs and initiated talk about them himself on more than
one occasion in the hotel room. Any hesitance on Barry's part
stemmed from his suspicions that something was amiss, she said.
   On the videotape, Barry said he didn't know how the crack pipe
worked and that he had never smoked crack before, Mundy pointed out.
   Barry was suspicious of a ``hotel room situation'' and ``he felt
intuitively something was going on'' when he walked into the hotel
room, said Moore. ``He was guarding his conversation.''
   Then ``why did he go on and hit the pipe?'' Mundy asked.
   ``Because he had a desire to,'' Moore replied.
   Barry, who was treated at two clinics following his arrest in
the sting, said outside the courtroom that he has been free of any
substance abuse for 163 days. He declined to say whether he was
treated for cocaine abuse. He has admitted to having problems with
alcohol and prescription drugs.

   The shootings reported in the Albanian
capital come at a time when that hard-line Communist nation has
sought to implement cautious reforms and pledged to respect human
rights.
   Reforms were initiated in May, following a year of popular
upheaval that ousted orthodox Communist governments from most
Eastern European nations.
   Now, scores of Albanians, apparently unimpressed with the scope
of the reforms, have fled to Western embassies in the last few days
in the largest known show of defiance against 45 years of Stalinist
rule. The Albanian government on Tuesday acknowledged that rioting
had broken out.
   Barely two weeks ago, the Albanian parliament, a rubber-stamp
body for Communist policy, approved new travel regulations under
which all citizens over 16 were gven the right to own a passport,
valid for five years.
   Such a concession would have been impossible under the late
Communist leader, Enver Hoxha, whose 40-year rule ended with his
death in 1985.
   The Tirana government, firmly committed to Marxism-Leninism as
interpreted by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, broke diplomatic ties
with the Soviet Union and China after those countries moved away
from what it considered orthodox communism.
   Britain and the United States severed ties with Tirana after
Hoxha's Communist Party won elections in 1945 following a purge of
anti-Communists.
   Ramiz Alia, who took over after Hoxha's death, slowly began to
open up the tiny Balkan nation of 3 million, establishing
diplomatic ties with dozens of countries while ruling out renewed
ties with the superpowers.
   In May, after the changes in the Soviet bloc, Albania's
Communist leaders began announcing cautious political, economic and
foreign policy reforms and signaled willingness to re-establish
ties with Washington and Moscow.
   Last month, the isolated nation indicated its wish to rejoin
Europe, saying it would seek full membership in the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that it had
boycotted since its inception in 1975.
   In another sign of moderate change, a family of Albanians who
had spent more than four years in the Italian Embassy in Tirana
were allowed in May to travel to Rome.
   The economic changes in ALbania have largely been designed to
improve food and energy supplies and beef up trade.
   But other reforms, such as the liberalized travel regulations,
the abolition of the death penalty for defectors and the lifting of
a ban on religious propaganda, appeared aimed both at appeasing the
population and impressing foreign governments.
   Albanian officials have pledged to honor the tenets of the
European Security Conference, including its human rights provisions.
   But despite the pledge of some reforms, Albanian leaders have so
far remained opposed to any form of political pluralism.
   The latest tensions follow Yugoslav and Greek newspaper reports
in January of unrest in the northern city of Shkoder and in the
capital of Tirana. These could not be independently confirmed and
were vehemently denied by high-ranking Albanian officials.

<HEAD>Orders for Manufactured Goods Rebound from April Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods in
May regained their 2.1 percent loss of a month earlier, the
government reported Tuesday, and analysts said industry may be
starting to recover from its slump.
   ``The manufacturing sector seems to have gone through the worst
and has a slight upward tilt,'' said Robert G. Dederick, chief
economist with the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. ``But the real
question is whether it's a false dawn and whether it will fade
again.''
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods rebounded 2.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted
$240.9 billion.
   The size of the May increase had been expected by many analysts.
At the same time, the size of the April decline was a slight
improvement from the 2.3 percent drop first reported.
   It was the third gain in orders since they dropped 5.5 percent
in January and their steepest decline since a 7.0 percent decrease
in December 1974. All major categories advanced in May except
non-durable orders, which were unchanged at $112.4 billion after
inching up 0.2 percent in April.
   But analysts expressed concern over the strength of any
manufacturing turnaround, saying much of it is coming from U.S.
exports while demand from American consumers has weakened recently.
   Exports represented just 14.2 percent of the 1989 gross national
product _ the nation's total output of goods and services _ while
personal consumption contributed 64.2 percent.
   ``Another weakness that has really been making the industrial
sector go sideways is capital spending,'' said Priscilla Trumbull,
an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``But we seem
to be seeing a little bit of improvement there.''
   Non-defense capital spending excluding aircraft edged up 0.1
percent in May after back-to-back 1.1 percent declines in the
preceding two months. This category often is often viewed as a
barometer of business investment plans.
   ``If this is part of a turnaround, it's still pretty much in the
embryonic stage,'' said Gordon Richards, director of economic
policy at the National Association of Manufacturers.
   Nevertheless, Richards and other analysts said the factory
orders report was the latest of several suggesting the
manufacturing slump may be about to reverse itself.
   Orders for durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last at
least three years _ jumped 4.0 percent to $128.6 billion, nearly
recovering the 4.1 percent decline in April.
   The often volatile defense orders also rose, up 19.2 percent to
$10.0 billion after gains of 4.8 percent and 4.5 percent. Excluding
the defense category, orders were up 1.5 percent.

   It was apparently just a typical
case of trying to make the boss look good when expert golfer Dan
Quayle spread the word that President Bush had beat him on the
links.
   ``He was just being pleasant, I'll bet,'' Bush said of his vice
president on Tuesday.
   Quayle somewhat sheepishly told reporters. ``He won on the first
tee.''
   ``Won one hole. That's what he meant,'' Bush clarified.
   Quayle had told reporters on Monday when setting out to golf
near Bush's seaside vacation home that he was ``destined to lose.''
   Quayle is renowned in Washington for his expertise on the golf
course. Bush on the other hand, is trying to improve his somewhat
ragged game.
   When asked later Monday who won the game at the Cape Arundel
Golf Course, Quayle said, ``The president won.'' Suspicion was
widespread that he was speaking tongue in cheek.
   Asked about that by reporters Tuesday during a photo session
outside Bush's seaside home, Quayle insisted ``the president won,
as he should.''
   But Bush interjected that Quayle had played well, with six
birdies _ ``that's pretty good golf.''
   Told that Quayle had said he won, Bush said ``He was just being
pleasant, I'll bet.''

<TEXT>
   About 800 Liberian rebels have
attacked their capital and several thousand more were approaching
to ``put an end'' to Liberian President Samuel Doe, a rebel source
said today.
   The source, based near the Liberian border, said rebel leader
Charles Taylor was at the front directing attacks on Monrovia, the
Liberian capital.
   In Washington, officials said the United States was prepared to
evacuate Doe if requested to do so.
   The rebel source said the fighters were preparing to attack the
city center but so far had only taken areas on Monrovia's outskirts.
   The Christian missionary radio station ELWA, in its 5 p.m. news
broadcast, said armed soldiers were stationed throughout Monrovia,
but it made no mention of fresh fighting. The broadcast was
monitored in Abidjan.
   Most city streets and public places were empty, the radio said,
because people were afraid of fighting breaking out. The report
said rebels controlled all roads in and out of Monrovia.
   Some of the advancing rebels were bringing up heavy artillery
and mortars in case Doe put up a last stand in his heavily
fortified executive mansion, the rebel source said.
   The source was reached by telephone from Abidjan and spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Rebels attacked Monrovia on Monday in a two-pronged offensive
that cut all major land routes from the capital, according to a
pool report filed by journalists there.
   International telephone and telex lines into the city were cut
on Monday morning. The city's water and electricity supply also
were cut after rebels captured their main facilities.
   The United States and other governments urged Doe to resign and
leave the country, a condition the rebels have set for accepting a
cease-fire.
   Four U.S. warships remained ``over the horizon'' off Liberia
ready to evacuate Americans or Doe if requested to do so by the
State Department, officials in Washington said.
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said the Navy ships
sent to the area May 31 were still in international waters.
   The Pentagon spokesman said the primary purpose of the Navy
ships, which have about 2,500 sailors and Marines on board, is to
evacuate Americans if needed.
   The State Department advised U.S. citizens on May 31 to leave
Liberia because of deteriorating conditions, and some departed on
chartered airline flights last month.
   In response to a question about possible evacuation of Doe,
Williams said, ``If the State Department were to ask us to assist
in moving President Doe, we would certainly be prepared to do what
they asked us.''
   Several countries have offered Doe asylum, including Nigeria and
Togo. Doe, 40, a former master sergeant, has ruled Liberia since a
bloody coup in April 1980. He ousted the descendents of freed
American slaves who had ruled the West African country for more
than a century.
   Doe initially won wide support, but subsequently was accused of
brutal oppression of critics, suppressing the country's free press
and mismanagement and corruption.
   The rebels, of the National Patriotic Front, invaded Liberia
from the Ivory Coast Dec. 24, sweeping across the country with
little resistance from Doe's forces.
   Government troops were accused of killing hundreds of kinsmen of
the rebels in an effort to put down the invasion. The deaths
increased support for the rebels, said reporters who visited the
war zone.
   The rebels in turn were accused of killing members of tribes
seen as supporting the president in revenge for the attacks on
their kinsmen.
   Government resistance stiffened when the rebels got within 35
miles of Monrovia four weeks ago.
   But the rebels broke through to attack the capital in the last
week, after refusing to attend a second round of church-mediated
peace talks aimed at ending the war.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the speech of Politburo
member Yegor K. Ligachev at the 28th Communist Party congress on
Tuesday, as translated by The Associated Press.
   ``If everything remains at the current level, the situation with
food supplies in the country will become even more critical. I am
aware of the difficulty of finding a solution to the problem.''
   ``We need to stick to public property as I think that it unites
people's interests while private property separates them and
without doubt leads to social differentiation in society.''
   ``What was the original goal of perestroika (reform)? It was to
use the full potential of socialism. I want to ask you, Does the
selling of factories to private owners really help to uncover all
possibilities of the socialist order? Of course not.''
   ``We are not justified in forgetting about the class approach,
which leads to our underestimating the class representation in the
soviets (elected legislatures), underestimating the workers' and
peasants' movement.''
   ``There are forces in our country fighting against socialist
order, against the Communist Party. They are acting with energy and
drive. They have strong influence on some of the mass media. They
applaud things that are directed toward the break-up of socialism
in our country, at undermining the party, present them as
innovations, as real perestroika. And often they shout about things
directed toward renovation and consolidation of socialism, saying
they are actions by conservative forces.
   ``My open, perhaps uncompromising position on true socialism and
the role of the party, my principles (I am not afraid of looking
immodest) have become the reason why I was placed in the center of
the political struggle and portrayed as a conservative and almost
an opponent of perestroika (reform). All means were used, as you
know, including libel and horrible charges.
   ``It seems there are commands from some center to start abusing
people on the principle that those who are not with us are against
us. They have ... started attacks on the army which has finally
started to defend itself.
   ``Comrades, I see no alternative to perestroika, renewal of the
society. I do not think of myself as a conservative or a radical. I
am just a realist and any limitless radicalism, improvisations, ..
have done little for us in the five years of perestroika.''
   ``The country really needs political stability. But there is
talk lately that (Communist) party or no party, perestroika will
continue. I think differently. ... I believe deeply that the party
will remain a Marxist-Leninist, democratic, viable force.''

   The NATO alliance is no longer needed to keep
the peace in Europe and should be replaced by a ``security
community'' of all European nations plus the United States, the
Soviet Union and Canada, a private group said Tuesday.
   The proposal by the British American Security Information
Council would do away with the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and its Cold War rival, the Warsaw Pact, which has
been fractured by the democracy movements in Eastern Europe.
   Replacing these military blocs would be a pan-European body
based on the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, or
CSCE, an existing organization comprised of the two superpowers,
Canada and all European nations except Albania. Its main role now
is to consider human rights and economic issues.
   The report said the CSCE should be broadened and given an
explicit link to the United Nations. France and some other European
governments already have suggested this, but the Bush
administration says CSCE should not be a replacement for NATO.
   Questions about reshaping NATO's military and political roles
are to be discussed at an alliance summit meeting Thursday and
Friday in London. The leaders are not expected to take any steps
toward dissolving the alliance; they are likely to say NATO will
change but will remain the central security body for Europe.
   At a meeting last month, leaders of the seven-nation Warsaw Pact
agreed to keep that alliance intact at least until the conclusion
this fall of a study on ways of transforming its role.
   The proposal unveiled Tuesday has been endorsed by numerous
European and American politicians, military experts and former
government officials, said David Shorr, associated director of the
group that published the report.
   Paul Warnke, a former director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, told a news conference the proposal was ``a
sensible blueprint for the future.''
   Warnke said he believed NATO should be preserved only until a
pan-European replacement organization is in place. He argued that
the alliance will not be needed because the threat of a Soviet
attack on Europe no longer exists.
   Among those endorsing the proposal, according to Shorr, is
Pierre Harmel, the former Belgian foreign minister who initiated a
landmark NATO study in 1967 that established the foundation for
Western relations with the Soviet bloc through the 1980s.
   The new report said a pan-European security organization would
have a permanent headquarters, perhaps in Berlin or Prague,
Czechoslovakia, and an ``inner security council'' consisting of the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and a reunified
Germany.
   The organization would mediate disputes among European
countries, serve as a negotiating forum for European disarmament
and verify and monitor agreed arms reductions. Members would sign a
treaty disavowing any threat or use of force against each other.

Expanding</HEAD>

   Already sluggish global economic growth is
likely to slow further in 1990, and growth in Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union is virtually at a standstill, according to a U.N.
report released Tuesday.
   The 1990 World Economic Survey by the U.N. Department of
International Economic and Social Affairs said world economic
output increased by 3.1 percent in 1989, compared with 4.4 percent
in 1988.
   It noted diversity in economic performance and said that
industrialized market economies continued to expand, growing by 3.5
percent. Although that was lower than the 4.3 percent in 1988, it
was stronger than had been expected, the report said.
   But the developing world as a whole, it said, suffered a
downturn in economic growth in 1989, dropping from 4.5 percent in
1988 to 3.4 percent in 1989. Economic performance varied greatly by
region.
   The report agreed in general with the findings of the
Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
which said last week that the economies of the industrialized world
remain on a steady course.
   Like the OECD report, it warned against inflation, especially in
East European countries that are changing from state-controlled to
market economies.
   ``Economic growth in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union came to
a virtual halt in 1989,'' it said, adding that output increased by
only 1.2 percent. U.N. economists said they did not expect a bright
picture for the immediate future in countries restructuring their
economies, although the long-term prospects could improve with
painful reform.
   ``The danger of rapid inflation in the reforming socialist
countries is a major concern,'' it said, ``requiring prudent
monetary and fiscal policies during the transition to more
market-oriented economies.''
   World trade, it said, maintained considerable buoyance and
increased by 6.7 percent in 1989. It was the fifth consecutive year
in which the increase in world trade exceeded the increase in world
output, the report said.
   It observed that the ``Brady Plan,'' named for former Treasury
Secretary Nicolas Brady, ``is not solving the debt problem of the
heavily indebted countries.''
   In 1989, it said, Latin America made a net transfer of $28
billion in financial resources to other countries. Africa's net
receipts of financial resources amounted to only $3 billion in
1989, a decline of $1 billion from the previous year.
   In several Latin American countries hyperinflation is a serious
problem, it said, and stabilization policies are likely to prove
costly in the short term. Long-term prospects are uncertain.
   The U.N. survey also predicted that world oil consumption will
reach a record high in 1990 and the gap between sustainable
production capacity and demand will narrow.
   The survey said developing countries as a group experienced a
sharp slowdown in economic growth in 1989. Their increase in output
declined from 4.5 percent in 1988 to 3.4 percent in 1989.
   The economies of South and East Asia grew by 6.2 percent,
compared with 8.2 percent in 1988, the survey said. China's growth
rate delined sharply, from 11.4 percent in 1988 to 3.9 percent in
1989.
   Latin America and the Caribbean saw only a 0.7 percent increase
and per capita output fell for the second consecutive year.
Inflation was unprecedented in the region.
   In Africa, economies expanded by 2.8 percent in 1989, below the
rate of population growth, and per capita output fell as a result.
   In West Asia, economic recovery continued with a 2.5 percent
growth rate. Economic stabilization measures stalled growth in
Mediterranean countries.
   The survey proposed establishment of a Central European Payments
Union, similar to the European Payments Union established after
World War II, as a temporary measure to assist reforming Eastern
European countries in their transition to market-oriented economies
with convertible currencies.
   ``Inflation is an inevitable consequence of the market-oriented
economic reform under way in the socialist countries,'' the survey
said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technical employees of The Associated Press have
rejected a proposed two-year contract with the news agency, their
union said Tuesday. The union and the AP agreed to meet again
Monday.
   James Peecook, president of Local 1314 of the Communications
Workers of America, said members overwhelmingly rejected the
contract. He said the vote count would not be released.
   AP technicians have been working under a contract extension
since early last month, when negotiators agreed to submit a
two-year contract proposal to a ratification vote. The union,
however, described the pact as inadequate and urged members to
reject it.
   D. Byron Yake, AP's director of human resources, said the
company would extend the terms of the expired contract through
Monday's meeting.
   Local 1314 represents about 300 AP technicians.
   The contract calls for a ``managed care'' approach to control
the cost of the medical plan. It also proposes weekly pay increases
of $23.50 for top-scale technicians in the first year and $24 in
the second, bringing weekly top-scale technician salaries to $612
in 1991.

<HEAD>Fighting Rages in Liberia; US Officials See Early Demise for Doe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As heavy fighting raged northeast of the
Liberian capital of Monrovia on Tuesday, U.S. officials said they
believed that the government of President Samuel K. Doe could
collapse in a matter of days.
   The officials, asking not to be identified, said that there had
been a number of desertions from the elite unit that protects Doe
and that his hold on power was becoming more precarious by the day.
   Two officials said Doe's demise could come before the weekend.
He has ruled Liberia for more than a decade.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there was
fighting on both sides of the St. Paul River in addition to the
combat northeast of Monrovia. The fighting was inhibiting
communications out of Liberia.
   Meanwhile, a rebel source reached by telephone from neighboring
Ivory Coast said about 800 rebels of Liberia's National Patriotic
Front have begun an attack on Monrovia and several thousand more
were approaching to ``put an end'' to Doe and his government.
   The source, based near the Liberian border, said rebel leader
Charles Taylor was at the front directing attacks on the Liberian
capital. Taylor launched his rebellion last Christmas eve,
reportedly with help from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. It is not
known whether Gadhafi has provided any assistance recently.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said a Navy task force
was standing ``over the horizon'' off Liberia ready to evacuate the
estimated 795 Americans in Liberia if requested to do so by the
State Department.
   ``We're considering all options, but a decision to evacuate has
not yet been made,'' said Boucher at the State Department. There
were no reports of injury to any Americans.
   Officials have said that the U.S. government is prepared to
evacuate Doe if it is asked to do so. They said Togo, also in West
Africa, has agreed to receive Doe if he is forced out of Liberia.
   Boucher said Monrovia was without water, electricity or
telephone service. All main roads out of the capital were cut. Most
of Doe's Cabinet and other senior administration officials have
fled. Liberian and diplomatic sources said army chief of staff Lt.
Gen. Henry Dubar resigned during the weekend. A dusk to dawn curfew
was in effect.
   Boucher said a Voice of America transmitter is located behind
rebel lines, but the rebel forces have not interfered with its
operations.
   The new U.S. ambassador to Liberia, Peter De Vos, met with Doe
on Sunday. On Monday, he met with the Vice President Harry Moniba
and three other senior legislators, Boucher said.
   U.S. policy has been to support the formation through political
negotiations of an interim government that would oversee a
transition to democratic rule.
   Doe has offered a national unity government with participation
by Taylor's group but the rebel leader has rejected the proposal.
Taylor has repeatedly demanded that Doe resign before he and the
rebels will stop their advance.
   There also have been official U.S. contacts with Taylor, a
former Liberian government official who infiltrated the country six
months ago with a small band of followers.
   Taylor has informed the U.S. envoys that if his movement ousts
Doe, he will promote democracy and respect human rights. But
officials have said they are not certain that Taylor will abide by
those pledges.
   Taylor also has offered assurances that his forces will not harm
Americans or other foreigners in Liberia, Boucher said.
   Other officials have said that U.S. envoys have called on Taylor
to exercise maximum restraint because a bloodbath could have an
impact on U.S. aid to Liberia, historically the largest recipients
of American assistance in sub-Saharan Africa.

   The road from Minsk to Moscow proved longer than
expected for Nikolai Shchesternev, who came to his first Communist
Party congress seeking direction. He was disappointed.
   ``I expected an analysis of the situation, but it hasn't
happened yet. It's all gray. I am not happy at all so far,''
Shchesternev told a reporter during a break Tuesday in the 28th
congress of the Soviet Communist Party.
   The 38-year-old computer specialist from the capital of
Byelorussia said in a wide-ranging interview that he came to the
Kremlin Palace of Congresses hoping to find ideas on improving the
lives of the employees in his enterprise, ideas that he said had
been lacking in five years of perestroika.
   And he hoped for a chance to tell the Kremlin leadership some of
the ideas bubbling up from the 4,400 members of the Communist Party
cell that selected him from among 21 candidates.
   Shchesternev said party leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform
policies of glasnost and perestroika have not helped him as party
secretary in the Consortium for Computer Production in the
Byelorussian capital of Minsk.
   ``In five years we have not found the idea that allows us to pay
people better or improve their living conditions and the speeches
so far don't indicate that we have found it yet,'' Shchesternev
complained.
   ``I am very pessimistic. I thought the report (Gorbachev's
report to the congress) would concentrate on philosophical and
economic principles, on how to lead the society, but there was none
of that,'' he said.
   With his red-and-gold congress badge pinned to the lapel of his
light grey suit, Shchesternev ressembles many of the other 4,656
delegates to the congress, although he is younger than most
delegates. The average age is 46.
   He spends most of his time during breaks at the congress and in
the evening at a nearby hotel with the other three delegates from
his cell and the rest of the 171-member Byelorussian delegation.
   Shchesternev said many members of his delegation believe party
policy should be formed on the basis of the experience of its
members and not dictated from the top.
   ``If the leadership doesn't draw on the resources of those on
the bottom, then the finale of this party is going to be a
sorrowful affair,'' he said.
   He said he had closely followed events in neighboring Poland,
where the Communist Party simply fell apart last year after failing
to meet society's political and economic aspirations.
   Shchesternev doesn't believe he will ever have a chance to speak
at this congress even though it will last at least eight more days.
   More than 400 delegates had deposited a white slip of paper in
wooden urns scattered throughout the massive Palace of Congresses
where the meeting is held saying they would like to speak.
   ``Unfortunately, I have no possibility to express myself, so we
are going to choose somebody from our delegation to represent us to
get the possibility to make ourselves heard,'' he said.
   Although the party has paid for Shchesternev's train tickets and
his hotel room in Moscow, the congress appears to be a pretty sober
affair even after the formal sessions are over.
   ``We spend the evening meeting in our delegations and work on
the results and look toward the future. There isn't much time for
anything else,'' Shchesternev said.

<HEAD>American Indians Pleased But Cautious About Mandela Offer to
Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   American Indian leaders say they're pleased by Nelson Mandela's
promise to return to the United States this fall and visit them,
but some also say he shouldn't assume their situation is the same
as that of South African blacks.
   ``Before Mr. Mandela can help the Indians, he's got to
understand the Indian tribes and their relation to the United
States,'' Mescalero Apache President Wendell Chino said after
hearing about Mandela's offer.
   ``It's not as simple as it looks,'' Chino said. ``The situation
of the Indian people is totally different.''
   Mandela made his announcement Saturday, on the last day of his
11-day U.S. trip. He told 58,000 people at a rally in Oakland,
Calif., that he would return in October to visit Indian
reservations and ``exchange views as to what I can do to help them
in their struggle.''
   ``The Indian people have written to me and explained their
problems, and it is but natural that I should respond to that by
seeing them as I proposed to do,'' Mandela said.
   The offer apparently had its origins in an invitation from two
women who met him at the Oakland airport and delivered an
invitation and gifts _ a sacred blanket, a shawl for Mandela's
wife, Winnie, and some traditional medicine.
   ``We told him that we share many of the same problems of his
country and would like to have the opportunity to share them with
him,'' said Betty Cooper, director of the non-profit Native
American Alcoholism Program in Oakland.
   Sally Gallegos, the executive director of the Oakland-based
Consortium of United Indian Nations, said the two weren't prepared
for Mandela to take them up on the offer.
   ``It was a shock,'' Gallegos said. ``The tribes had a concern to
make known to Mandela _ that we are here.''
   Gallegos and Cooper were attending a conference in San Francisco
sponsored by Families in Recovery, an organization that mainly
serves Indian drug addicts and alcoholics and their families.
   They and others at the meeting said Indians were dismayed that
they were not invited to officially receive the South African
leader despite the parallels between their plight and that of
blacks under the South African system of apartheid.
   ``Nelson Mandela is as much a symbol as a reality, and that
symbol for us is one of disenfranchisement, oppression and his
ultimate victory,'' said John Perez, an Apache representing the
Life Plus Foundation.
   American-Indian leaders generally agreed that a visit by Mandela
could help them highlight problems in their communities _ poverty
and poor education among them.
   ``The problems are so serious that I think any kind of public
attention will be helpful,'' said Gary Kimble, director of the
Association on American Indian Affairs, an Indian rights
organization based in New York.
   Chino, the Mescalaro Apache leader, agreed that a Mandela visit
would be good for Indians.
   ``I think what's going to happen is the United States is going
to be grossly embarrassed if Mandela comes back and exposes the
paternalism, broken promises and the erosion of various treaty
obligations,'' Chino said Monday.
   But some Indian leaders also agreed with Chino's point that
there are vast differences between Indians and South African blacks.
   ``The difference I think is that nobody is intentionally
preventing Indians from becoming part of the legislature,'' said
Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., the only American Indian in
Congress. ``In South Africa, they virtually lock black people out
of running from office.''
   And others have taken a skeptical approach to the entire matter.
   ``Mr. Mandela's going to have enough problems of his own in
South Africa to just come back here and help us,'' said Wayne
Ducheneaux of Eagle Butte, S.D., president of the National Congress
of American Indians. ``We'll wait to see what this means.''

<HEAD>Investigators Blame Pilot in USAir Crash</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New with editing throughout.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators said today that
the captain of USAir Flight 5050 probably caused the crash of his
jetliner by failing to respond adequately to problems during
takeoff.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, in a 4-0 vote, also
said the plane's problems began with an erroneously set rudder
control that the pilot failed to detect. It said it could not
determine how the control was wrongly set.
   The board said the probable cause of the crash was ``the
captain's failure to exercise his command authority in a timely
manner to reject the takeoff or take sufficient control to continue
the takeoff.'' It also cited his failure to detect the rudder
problem.
   Two of the 57 passengers aboard the plane were killed when it
skidded off the end of the LaGuardia airport runway Sept. 20. All
six crew members survived.
   Board member Jim Burnett moved to also blame USAir for failing
to staff the plane with an ``adequately prepared and seasoned
flight crew.'' But other board members rejected that proposal,
saying the crew members met all regulatory requirements.
   ``We are putting a tremendous burden on one individual in a very
complex system,'' said board member John Lauber. But he said this
was justified because there were so many lapses in the pilot's
performance, including his decision to let an inexperienced
co-pilot control the takeoff.
   Bob Benzon, staff investigator in charge of the crash, said
earlier the plane's rudder trim was set for full left rudder. But,
he said, ``Enough rudder authority remained to fully control the
aircraft during takeoff and in the air.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration suspended the flight
certificates of USAir pilot Michael Martin and copilot Constantine
Kleissas, who was controlling the takeoff of a Boeing 737 passenger
flight for the first time.
   The Air Line Pilots Association protested the actions as
``totally unwarranted.''
   ALPA official Tom Kraemer said later the decision was a ``total
travesty'' and the board should have blamed the design of the
rudder control of the Boeing 737.
   But both Martin and Kleissas dropped appeals of the suspension
and can fly again if they pass recertification tests.
   The FAA said Martin ``does not possess the care, skill, judgment
and responsibility'' of a commercial pilot and cited his failure to
fully complete a pre-takeoff checklist and perform other required
actions on the taxiway before he ordered the takeoff aborted.
   Crash investigators said the rudder was erroneously set all the
way to the left, causing the plane to drift to the side during the
takeoff attempt, although cockpit communication tapes showed the
pilots made all the proper checks.
   In February, the FAA ordered a Boeing-designed change in the
control panels of 737s to prevent accidental movement of a rudder
trim control knob that could reduce the pilot's ability to control
the plane.
   The changes cost about $830 per plane and affected 641 Boeing
737-300 and 737-400 models worldwide. Although FAA safety orders
are not mandatory for foreign carriers, they usually comply.
   Boeing began work to redesign the cockpit controls before the
crash, following reports that the rudder-trim knobs could be
affected by visitors in the cockpit placing their feet on the
console or a pilot throwing down a manual.
   The NTSB conducted a hearing in New York on the USAir crash,
taking testimony on rudder control design, cockpit crew training,
crew coordination, the effects of the USAir-Piedmont merger, runway
design, and FAA scrutiny of USAir operations.

   Less than thunderous reviews for the stock
car racing movie ``Days of Thunder'' haven't diminished Tom
Cruise's pride in his starring vehicle.
   ``I don't read reviews, even the good ones. They don't affect me
or the film,'' he said Monday. ``A lot of filmmakers whom I respect
have called me to say how much they liked the movie. They were
actually surprised.''
   ``Days of Thunder'' was No. 1 at the weekend box office but
grossed $15.5 million, a slower start than ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Total
Recall,'' ``Another 48 HRS.,'' ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' and
``Back to the Future Part III.''
   ``You can buy yourself an opening by putting your picture in
3,500 theaters and spending a lot of money,'' Cruise said. ``The
important thing is to have `legs,''' the industry term for staying
power.
   ``The exit polls for `Days of Thunder' have been fantastic,'' he
said. ``I'm very happy with the reaction to the film when I've seen
it in theaters.''
   Cruise, an amateur stock car racer who has a financial interest
in the film, conceived the story four years ago.
   ``I studied all the past race movies I could find,'' he said.
``I found different things in each of them but none of them took
the spirit of the driver and developed it. That's what we tried to
do.''

   Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin was in
good condition Tuesday after a two-hour operation on a broken right
hip, hospital officials said.
   Devorah Weissman, spokeswoman for Jerusalem's Shaarei Tzedek
Hospital, said Begin would be moved to the orthopedic ward on
Wednesday. He is expected to make a complete recovery, said the
hospital's director, Dr. Yonathon Halevy.
   Begin, 76, tripped and fell in his living room, Ms. Weissman
said. The bone was vulnerable from a earlier break, when Begin fell
in the bathroom of his home while he was prime minister in 1981.
   Tuesday's hospitalization was the second for the former prime
minister at Shaarei Tzedek this year. He was admitted with
pneumonia on May 16 and released two weeks later.
   Begin, who founded the right-wing Herut Party, the precursor to
the Likud bloc that now heads the government, stepped down as
premier in September 1983 without explanation. Since his
resignation, Begin has lived in seclusion.

   Prince Felipe, the crown prince of
Spain, was left alone at the helm of a racing yacht Tuesday when
his mischievous crew suddenly scurried below deck.
   Felipe, 22, showed no concern, but his bemused smile delighted
the contingent of Spanish photographers snapping the prince's every
move from an accompanying news media boat.
   ``It certainly caught His Highness by surprise,'' said David
Barnes, the skipper of KZ7, a 12-meter yacht that challenged for
the America's Cup off western Australia 3{ years ago. ``He thought
it was a great joke, and called out that he would give us a yell if
he got into trouble.''
   Felipe, heir to the throne, hopes to compete in the 1992 Olympic
Games at Barcelona. His father, King Juan Carlos, has twice
represented Spain as an Olympic yachtsman and has competed in two
Fastnet races off England.

   The prosecution of the 2 Live Crew
rappers charged with participating in an obscene performance has
hit a snag, a defense lawyer says: The videotape of their show is
too garbled to understand.
   ``It's terrible, and you can't make out the words,'' said Allen
Jacobi, the group's attorney.
   Broward County deputies made the tape last month, two days after
U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled that their album ``As Nasty
as They Wanna Be'' was obscene.
   Band members Luther Campbell, Mark Ross and Chris Wongwon, and
Fort Lauderdale record store owner Charles Freeman, who sold their
album, were formally charged Tuesday.
   The rappers, arrested after an adults-only concert on June 10,
face up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted,
prosecutors said.
   David Hobbs, 2 Live Crew's disc jockey, does not vocalize the
group's lyrics and was not charged.

   Davy Crockett probably wasn't born on a
mountaintop in Tennessee. And nobody really thinks he shot a bear
when he was only 3.
   But that doesn't take anything away from the legend, at least
for the 180 Crockett descendants gathering in Texas this week.
   ``Those kinds of things are interesting to read about, but they
don't necessarily reflect the real David Crockett,'' said Leonard
Stasney, one of the Crockett descendants holding their fifth
biennial reunion at this town, 30 miles southwest of Fort Worth.
Davy's widow settled in Granbury after his death at the battle of
the Alamo in San Antonio in 1836.
   ``The myth was bigger than the man,'' said descendant Sandra
Weaver of Granbury, who wore a cloth Crockett doll with a real coon
tail on the cap, the whole thing pinned to her shoulder like a huge
corsage.
   Ms. Weaver and Crockett kin traded tales about their famous
ancestor Tuesday at the clan picnic, swapped gossip and argued over
the best place to get a genuine coonskin cap.
   They debated how often a fighter could fire the muskets of
Davy's day and whether Crockett was killed in action or, as some
historians say, executed by the Mexicans after surrendering the
Alamo.
   ``Davy Crockett went down swinging a rifle _ he wasn't no
coward,'' insisted Charles Edward Crockett Sr. of Falls City, Ore.
   ``It just doesn't matter,'' Ms. Weaver said. ``All the men who
died at the Alamo were heroes.''
   For the descendants gathered at Granbury's Plantation Inn, it's
the search for a ``real'' Davy Crockett that matters most.
   And according to them, that's not the Davy Crockett a generation
of Americans knew from the Disney TV series that made the
buckskin-clad actor Fess Parker an instant celebrity and prompted
millions of youngsters to buy coonskin caps.
   The show became one of the biggest overnight hits in television
history. Ninety million people watched the TV Davy swing his rifle
as Santa Anna's troops attacked the Alamo, according to Disney
productions. ``The Ballad of Davy Crockett,'' the theme song of the
series, sold 18 million copies in 1955, Billboard said.
   Joy Bland, the new president of the descendants' group,
dismisses all that as Hollywood glamour.
   ``They don't stick to the real facts. I never could sit through
the whole program. It was awful,'' said Ms. Bland, of Paris, Tenn.
``The clothing was too modern; the story line was unrealistic.''
   Only one descendant donned a coonskin cap for the reunion, and
he was in period costume to demonstrate the rifles and muskets of
Crockett's era.
   About 200 people belong to the non-profit corporation
Descendants of David Crockett, based in Tennessee. Members must be
blood relations to Crockett. Associate memberships are extended to
cousins, historians and others who revere the pioneer.
   ``It's kind of exciting to talk to all the people that you are
related to that you don't really know,'' Stasney said. ``It's just
exciting to know that we can share the little bits and pieces of
information and learn a little more about who we are.''
   Some said it's simply a relief to tell people they're Crockett
descendants and be believed.
   Toni Daigle of Whitecastle, La., said she takes pictures and
documents to her children's school to convince classmates they
really are related to the famous frontiersman.
   ``It's hard,'' Ms. Daigle said, ``because some other kids come
up and say, ``Oh yeah _ I'm kin to Abraham Lincoln, too.''

   A federal judge sentenced a print shop
owner Tuesday to three years in prison for plotting to ship arms to
Ireland.
   Brian Joseph Fleming, 32, was caught in a ``sting'' after he and
another man tried to purchase restricted weapons, including M-16s,
from undercover agents.
   Evidence linked the two to a group called Fianna Eireann, which
Northern Ireland's top police officer testified is the youth
brigade of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   Fleming's co-conspirator, Charles Farrell Malone, 63, of San
Francisco, was sentenced June 25 to a 2{-year prison term and three
years' probation.
   In addition to the three-year prison term, Fleming, of
Enterprise, was fined $6,000 and placed on three years' probation.
   At the sentencing hearing, U.S. District Judge Robert Varner
told Fleming that ``if enough people in the country are shipping
arms to any revolutionary forces, it's the sort of thing that could
involve this country in a war.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles Niven said authorities never
traced any weapons from Fleming to groups associated with the IRA.
``He was attempting to do it,'' Niven said.
   Fleming was questioned by federal agents earlier this year in
connection with an investigation into the mail-bomb slaying of a
federal judge in Birmingham and a civil rights lawyer in Savannah,
Ga.
   Federal agents later said there was no connection between the
two cases. No one has been charged in the mail bombings.

<TEXT>
   Scientists have tagged about 500 geese
in a program to reduce the chances a hunter will bag a goose
contaminated with radiation near the Oak Ridge nuclear installation.
   Some geese have staked their claim at several ponds on the
Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory compound, said
Gordon Blaylock, an Oak Ridge environmental scientist.
   Several ponds were used at one time as collection basins for
nuclear waste, and Blaylock says those still are hot with
radioactivity.
   Those ponds are getting a closer look from Oak Ridge staffers,
who tagged more than 300 geese last week in an effort to track
their movement.
   ``As long as we control the small ponds, I don't think you're
going to get a goose with a serious problem,'' Blaylock said.
   In some cases, fences were put up to keep geese from walking
into an area, while streamers attacked to rows of fishing line
strung across the ponds are meant to deter geese.
   During the past two years scientists have collared about about
500, or one-fourth, of the estimated 2,000 non-migratory Canada
geese living near the government nuclear complex, Blaylock said.
   The geese, introduced several years ago by the Tennessee Valley
Authority, are mostly non-migratory but move within a limited area,
he said. The birds' movement patterns are of interest to
scientists, Blaylock said.
   The tags can be seen with viewing scopes, letting staffers track
the birds' movement without having to capture them again.
   Other geese are tagged with leg bands, which direct that hunters
return the metal bands to Oak Ridge and include information on the
bird's location.
   Blaylock said Monday that six geese found living on a hot pond
near the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge were presumed to be
contaminated with radioactive cobalt-60. Those geese were killed
for study rather than risking the possibility of contaminated birds
leaving the area, he said.

<HEAD>North, South Koreans Agree To Arrange Summit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea and South Korea took a major
step toward reconciliation Tuesday and agreed to a historic meeting
between their top government leaders.
   The talks could be held as early as August, officials said.
   Delegates from the countries met at the border truce village of
Panmunjom and agreed to sign an accord July 26 that would outline a
proposed agenda and procedures for the first meeting of prime
ministers.
   It would be the first such meeting since the division of the
peninsula in 1945 into the communist North and capitalist South.
   In earlier talks, both sides agreed the summit would be held
alternately in the countries' capitals. Each side would have seven
representatives, including the prime minister and two military
delegates.
   The breakthrough on a summit came after South Korea accepted
North Korea's proposal to place political and military topics ahead
of humanitarian and other exchanges on the agenda. Seoul had
insisted on the opposite.
   Tuesday's meeting was the seventh of a series since February
1989. The talks had been suspended for five months.
   Unlike most dialogue between the countries, Tuesday's was
largely free of acrimony and tension.
   South Korea's chief delegate, Song Han-ho, later said he
expected no problems in signing a procedural agreement for the
summit. His communist counterpart, Paik Nam Jun, expressed similar
views at a separate news conference.
   Song said he hoped the prime ministers talks would open ``a new
chapter for realizing peaceful unification of the peninsula.''
   ``We cannot stick to the logic of the Cold War and ignore
changes in the world any longer,'' he said.
   Paik said Tuesday's talks ``marked a new milestone in the
history of the North-South Korea dialogue.''
   Tuesday's agreement was widely seen as a major breakthrough in
that dialogue. But observers cautioned that the talks could still
falter, pointing to decades of hostility and distrust on both sides.
   During a previous border meeting, North Korea once asked South
Korea to end the joint U.S.-South Koran military exercises called
Team Spirit.
   North Korea called off talks with South Korea in January to
protest the exercises and demanded the withdrawal of all U.S.
troops based in South Korea.
   South Korean officials said arms reduction and other measures
easing tensions could be discussed at the prime ministers' meeting
as a first step toward eventual unification.
   Buoyed by its economic success, Seoul has improved relations
with the Soviet Union and other North Korean allies and also has
urged Pyongyang to open its doors.
   Talks have been held sporadically between the two Koreas, but
little progress had been made until recently. The border on both
sides is heavily fortified and sealed, blocking exchanges of mail
and transportation.
   North Korea is one of the last totalitarian Communist states,
and sweeping changes in East Europe and its socialist allies have
made little impact.
   Paik, the chief North Korean delegate, told the meeting Tuesday
that unification should be carried out independently with no
interference from other countries.
   He chided the South for ``soliciting help from outsiders on
reunification,'' referring to South Korean President Roh Tae-woo's
recent meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in San
Francisco.

   Interior Minister Prince Nayef said
today 1,426 Moslem pilgrims died in a stampede in a 1,500-foot-long
pedestrian tunnel that was crowded with 50,000 people.
   Prince Nayef said the disaster was caused when seven pilgrims
fell from an overhead bridge near the tunnel, which linked this
holy city with a tent city.
   Other sources said a power failure caused the air conditioning
in the 60-foot-wide tunnel to switch off in 112-degree heat Monday
morning, setting off the stampede.
   ``It was God's will, which is above everything,'' King Fahd said
of the disaster. ``It was fate.''
   Prince Nayef, who is the Saudi monarch's brother, did not give
the nationalities of the victims.
   He said that a number of other pilgrims fainted and were treated
on the spot, but he did not provide a figure.
   ``The fall of the seven spread terror, and the tremendous
throngs of the pilgrims caused them all to tumble onto each
other,'' he said.
   He explained that the tunnel itself was packed ``multiple times
beyond its capacity, with some 50,000 people inside.''
   The disaster occurred during the hajj, one of the world's
largest religious gatherings, which draws about 2 million Moslems.
Observances had largely ended, and pilgrims were observing
post-hajj rituals or preparing to leave.
   Diplomats told The Associated Press on Monday night that about
1,400 pilgrims were killed. Asian and Middle Eastern diplomats, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said most of the victims were
Malaysian and Indonesian pilgrims.
   Doctors at hospitals said today that large numbers of Egyptians
and Pakistanis were among the dead.
   King Fahd acknowledged indirectly that there had been a large
loss of life.
   He called the dead ``martyrs of the Islamic world.''
   ``Had they not died there, they would have died elsewhere and at
the same predestined moment,'' the king said at a meeting Monday
night with pilgrimage security officials.
   The deaths shattered what had been a peaceful observance of the
annual haff and was the worst pilgrimage tragedy in recent years.
In previous years, the celebration has been marred by terrorist
attacks and riots.
   Diplomats said the tunnel became packed beyond capacity when
some pilgrims stopped in the middle while people outside continued
to push their way in.
   A witness said the tunnel became clogged with the crush of
people.
   ``With the lack of oxygen, a good number collapsed unconscious,
and some died. There was also a stampede,'' said the witness, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said he helped carry victims to the ambulances waiting by the
tunnel's exits, but that he did not know how many of the stricken
were dead and how many were simply unconscious.
   The pedestrian walkway runs under part of a mountain, but
sometimes cars use it as a shortcut, filling it with choking fumes,
sources said.
   As the scope of the disaster became apparent, ambulances and
security forces rushed to the tunnel, which joins Mecca and the
pilgrim tent city of Mina.
   ``Thousands of the pilgrims thronged through the tunnel of
Mo'essem, causing severe congestion within the tunnel as the
pressure was beyond its capacity,'' state-run Riyadh radio said.
   The official Saudi Press Agency quoted King Fahd as saying the
pilgrims had failed to follow safety rules ``issued in good time
ahead of the (pilgrimage) season.'' But he pledged to work for
better safety.
   ``God willing, we will see no tragedies in the coming years,''
he said.
   The tunnel is part of $15 billion development plan for the holy
sites, including other tunnels and overhead bridges, to move
pilgrims in a more orderly fashion.
   The king said the disaster caused grief to Moslems everywhere.
   ``But I reiterate that it is the inescapable will of God,'' he
said.
   An estimated 2 million Moslems, including 800,000 visitors from
around the world, come to Islam's holy sites in and around Mecca
for the hajj.
   The celebration climaxed Sunday with prayers on Mount Arafat,
about eight miles from Mecca.
   The rituals being celebrated Monday _ the Eid Al-Adha, or the
Feast of Sacrifice _ commemorate the Prophet Abraham's offering of
his son in sacrifice to God.
   Before Monday, only a small fire at Mina and a few cases of heat
fatigue had disrupted the pilgrimage season. Terrorism blamed on
Iranian or Shiite Moslems has occurred in the past three years.
   The worst incident was in 1987, when Iranians clashed with
security forces, leading to the death of more than 400 pilgrims.
The year before, the Saudis confiscated large quantities of
explosives from members of the Iranian contingent.
   The Saudis have since set a quota of 1,000 pilgrims per million
residents of each Islamic nation. Iranians, angered by the quotas,
have boycotted the hajj since 1988.
   Last year, some small bombs went off during the hajj, killing
one pilgrim and injuring 16. The Saudis tried and convicted Kuwaiti
Shiite Moslems and beheaded 16 of them.

   Patriarch Dimitrios I of the Eastern Orthodox
Church praised Turkey on Tuesday as a bridge between East and West.
   The patriarch, born in Istanbul 75 years ago, spoke at a lunch
given in his honor by Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir of Turkey.
Dimitrios is a Turkish citizen.
   The patriarch's visit to the United States, the first by any
Orthodox patriarch, is politically sensitive because of the
historic tensions between Greece and Turkey. Orthodoxy is the
official religion in Greece; the patriarch usually speaks in Greek,
and Olympic Airways, the Greek national airline, put one of its
planes at his disposal for the trip.
   Dimitrios, offering a toast at the luncheon, said:
   ``Turkey forms a bridge between Asia and Europe, between East
and West, and as the world of today more and more discovers its
oneness and unifying bridges are being built everywhere, Turkey's
contribution to the shaping of this new world will prove
substantive.''
   The traditions of the Orthodox church go back to St. Andrew the
Apostle, believed to have founded it in Byzantium, later called
Constantinople and now Istanbul, in A.D. 36. When Moslem Turks
conquered the city in 1453, they allowed the headquarters of the
church to remain there.
   Dimitrios' toast emphasized his role as a religious leader.
   ``As the church, we always leave politics to the political and
diplomatic community, confining ourselves only to those things
which can secure man's well-being and above all his salvation,'' he
said.
   He toasted Turkey as ``our beloved country'' and President
Turgut Ozal as ``the beloved president of our democracy.''
   ``Our contribution as the (Greek) minority in Turkey and as the
religious leadership of that minority, and many other Orthodox
faithful in America, Western Europe, Australia and elsewhere _ our
contribution is that of prayer,'' he said.
   Dimitrios is the spiritual leader of 250 million Orthodox
believers worldwide, most of them in the Soviet Union and eastern
Europe. An estimated 6 million live in North and South America.

   Military authorities are investigating the
deaths of 11 people who tried to flee across the Western border
during the shoot-to-kill policy of East Germany's ousted Communist
regime, an official said Tuesday.
   The policy and the activities of the former security police have
raised a public outcry for prosecutions of former officials.
   A murder inquiry is under way against ousted Communist Party
chief Erich Honecker for his part in the shoot-to-kill policy, but
the ailing 77-year-old is not expected to stand trial.
   In his announcement Tuesday, chief military prosecutor Col.
Karlheinz Boesel said he would only investigate whether the guards
involved had obeyed orders under a law on dereliction of duty.
   Relatives have pressed homicide charges in all 11 cases.
   The military prosecutor told the West German television network
ARD that he refused to regard the soldiers as ``violent criminals''
if they merely used their firearms according to orders.
   A total of 192 would-be escapees are known to have perished
since the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. It was thrown open only last
year as the pro-democracy revolution swept the country.
   The military prosecutor also argued for a general amnesty for
border guards who had fired at refugees so that ``they are offered
a way out and a chance to make themselves known.''
   The shoot-to-kill command was signed in 1961 by Gen. Heinz
Hoffmann, who was East Germany's defense minister until his death
in 1985.
   East Germans are seeking to deal with taints in their Communist
past as they rush toward reunification with West Germany.
   The East German government late Monday proposed all-German
elections on Dec. 2.
   Although the West German government hasn't officially responded,
government sources in Bonn said they welcomed the idea.
   The two nations merged their currencies and economies Sunday.
   One hurdle to formal unity is the future military alignment of
what will be one of Europe's mightiest military powers.
   The United States, France and Britain insist that Germany must
be a member of the West's North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
perhaps with both Soviet and American troops deployed on its soil.
   But Moscow has insisted the new German nation be neutral.
   West German Defense Ministry sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said in Bonn that their government was willing to
consider a Soviet proposal to limit troops of a united Germany to
about 400,000.
   The two German states now have combined forces of about 600,000.

   As heavy fighting raged northeast of the
Liberian capital of Monrovia on Tuesday, U.S. officials said they
believed that the government of President Samuel K. Doe could
collapse in a matter of days.
   The officials, asking not to be identified, said that there had
been a number of desertions from the elite unit that protects Doe
and that his hold on power was becoming more precarious by the day.
   Two officials said Doe's demise could come before the weekend.
He has ruled Liberia for more than a decade.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there was
fighting on both sides of the St. Paul River in addition to the
combat northeast of Monrovia. The fighting was inhibiting
communications out of Liberia.
   Meanwhile, sources in Monrovia told reporters that Doe has
agreed in principle to resign. The sources said he was under
pressure from close associates in addition to the advancing rebels.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Doe
agreed to step down only on the condition that his safety and that
of his minority Krahn tribe are guaranteed.
   And a rebel source, reached by telephone from neighboring Ivory
Coast, said about 800 rebels of Liberia's National Patriotic Front
have begun an attack on Monrovia and several thousand more were
approaching to ``put an end'' to Doe and his government.
   That source, based near the Liberian border, said rebel leader
Charles Taylor was at the front directing attacks on the Liberian
capital. Taylor launched his rebellion last Christmas eve,
reportedly with help from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. It is not
known whether Gadhafi has provided any assistance recently.
   At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said a Navy task force
was standing ``over the horizon'' off Liberia ready to evacuate the
estimated 795 Americans in Liberia if requested to do so by the
State Department.
   ``We're considering all options, but a decision to evacuate has
not yet been made,'' said Boucher at the State Department. There
were no reports of injury to any Americans.
   Officials have said that the U.S. government is prepared to
evacuate Doe if it is asked to do so. They said Togo, also in West
Africa, has agreed to receive Doe if he is forced out of Liberia.
   Boucher said Monrovia was without water, electricity or
telephone service. All main roads out of the capital were cut. Most
of Doe's Cabinet and other senior administration officials have
fled. Liberian and diplomatic sources said army chief of staff Lt.
Gen. Henry Dubar resigned during the weekend. A dusk to dawn curfew
was in effect.
   Boucher said a Voice of America transmitter is located behind
rebel lines, but the rebel forces have not interfered with its
operations.
   The new U.S. ambassador to Liberia, Peter De Vos, met with Doe
on Sunday. On Monday, he met with the Vice President Harry Moniba
and three other senior legislators, Boucher said.
   U.S. policy has been to support the formation through political
negotiations of an interim government that would oversee a
transition to democratic rule.
   Doe has offered a national unity government with participation
by Taylor's group but the rebel leader has rejected the proposal.
Taylor has repeatedly demanded that Doe resign before he and the
rebels will stop their advance.
   There also have been official U.S. contacts with Taylor, a
former Liberian government official who infiltrated the country six
months ago with a small band of followers.
   Taylor has informed the U.S. envoys that if his movement ousts
Doe, he will promote democracy and respect human rights. But
officials have said they are not certain that Taylor will abide by
those pledges.
   Taylor also has offered assurances that his forces will not harm
Americans or other foreigners in Liberia, Boucher said.
   Other officials have said that U.S. envoys have called on Taylor
to exercise maximum restraint because a bloodbath could have an
impact on U.S. aid to Liberia, historically the largest recipients
of American assistance in sub-Saharan Africa.

of injustice for the striking discrepancy between the proclaimed
ideals and slogans and reality.
   In the last quarter of the 20th century, international
developments are no longer determined by the struggle of two
opposing systems, that it is no longer subordinated completely ...
to the dynamics of the conflict of class interests. Having come
long ago to the conclusion about deadlocks into which we are pushed
by dogmatism and ideological schemes that kill living ideas, I
actively supported and practically implemented the idea of the
priority of human values to class, group or any other interests.
   I realized quite clearly that false ideology _ besides
distorting goals and substituting concepts _ has also weight, aims,
clear material incarnation.

   I am more than convinced that our state needs strong armed
forces. But we can be armed to the teeth and live in fear ofan
attack, or you can be sure no one will attack you because policies
can create conditions when the country will have no opponents or
enemies.
   If we continue as we did _ to spend one-quarter of gross
national income on military spending _ we will ruin the country and
we will simply not need any defense anymore. A ruined country and
poor people do not need an army. It does not make sense to defend a
system that has led to an economic and social devastation. It is up
to politics to create security with cuts in defense expenditure.

   Is Eastern Europe a failure of our diplomacy? Yes, if our
diplomacy has never and could not set itself the aim to oppose the
elimination in other countries of forced and alien
administrative-command systems, totalitarian regimes. Even if
events in Eastern Europe had not been in our interests, we would
have not interfered in their affairs. We recognize, not in words
but in deeds, the equality of nations, sovereignty of peoples,
non-interference into their affairs, their right to free choice.
Any other position is chauvinism, imperialism.
   The fact that democratically elected leaders of our allies came
to the meeting of the highest body of Warsaw Treaty Organization
does not seem a failure, but an expression of respect of our
perestroika.
   We diplomats expected the changes in Eastern Europe, but we
could not interfere.
   We forecast this. We sensed that if there were not changes,
there would be tragedy.
   It bitterly hurts me to see that there are people whose
assertions lead one to believe that the Soviet Army didn't liberate
some Eastern European countries but all but captured them as war
trophies. Chauvinistic statements insulting the dignity of
sovereign states are permitted by some.
   I see it as my moral obligation to apologize before the peoples
of East European states for such insulting and unacceptable
escapades on the part of my fellow countrymen.

   Snooky Lanson, the smiling crooner of
``Your Hit Parade,'' television's pop music show of the 1950s, has
died at age 76.
   He died Monday night at St. Thomas Hospital, where he had been a
patient since Saturday, said hospital spokeswoman Elise Shelton.
The hospital did not release the cause of death.
   Lanson sang on ``Your Hit Parade,'' a spinoff of radio's ``Lucky
Strike Hit Parade,'' from 1950 to 1957. The TV show featured
elaborate production numbers of the week's seven most popular
songs, with No. 1 always presented last.
   ``I sang `Mona Lisa' 13 straight weeks because it was a man's
song and I was the only man on the show then,'' Lanson recalled in
a 1979 interview.
   He later was joined by Russell Arms. Other singers on ``Your Hit
Parade'' included Dorothy Collins, Polly Bergen, Gisele MacKenzie,
Eileen Wilson and June Valli.
   ``The show didn't have any stars per se and we all got along
well,'' Lanson said. ``It was very clean and there was no
suggestive dancing: a 5- or 6-year-old could watch it.
   ``And of course a lot of people watched it to see what song was
No. 1 that week.''
   Lanson, whose real name was Roy Landman, was born in Memphis. He
was nicknamed ``Snooky'' at age 2 after the Irving Berlin tune
``Snooky-Ookums.''
   Lanson began singing in a church choir as a boy. He moved to
Nashville after high school and got a job with band leader Francis
Craig at Nashville radio station WSM.
   In 1940, he was hired by the Ray Noble Band. A year later, he
recorded the hit record ``By the Light of the Silvery Moon'' with
the band.
   In the late 1940s, he sang ``The Old Master Painter,'' a hit
which helped him land the spot on ``Your Hit Parade.''
   The Saturday night show's popularity waned when rock 'n' roll
began dominating the pop charts. Lanson and other regulars were
replaced in 1957 by younger performers, and the show left the air
two years later.
   Lanson went on to perform in nightclubs, to be a host of TV
variety shows in Atlanta and Shreveport, La. He also had a
syndicated radio show, and sold cars and outdoor advertising at
various times.
   He is survived by his wife, Florence, two sons, a daughter and
eight grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Farmers spent an estimated $124.1 billion on
production expenses last year, up 4.9 percent from $118.4 billion
in 1988, according to a preliminary report by the Agriculture
Department released Tuesday.
   But that was still far below the record level of $131.8 billion
spent in 1981, just before a general financial crunch that stalled
expansion in the nation's agricultural sector.
   In 1986, annual spending by farmers dropped to less than $106
billion, reflecting massive cutbacks in capital investments as land
values plummeted and debts weighed heavily on so many.
   The last report by the department's National Agricultural
Statistics Service showed 1989 expenditures rose for all major
categories farm and land improvements, which dropped 6.3 percent,
and fuel, which declined slightly.
   Farm services, which include rent, comprised the largest
expenditure by farmers at $26.7 billion, up 0.7 percent from 1988.
These services accounted for 22 percent of overall production
expenses.
   Feed expenses were estimated at $18.2 billion, up 1.7 percent,
accounting for 15 percent of the total 1989 expenditures.
   Overall, last year's production expenditures averaged $57,478
per farm, an increase of $2,522 from 1988.
   The analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not
include figures for net income or profits.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of physicians walked off their jobs
Tuesday, shutting clinics and disrupting hospitals in a one-day
strike against a court-ordered cut in government overtime payments.
   Israeli media said the job action involved 12,000 doctors, but
many of them were expected to keep treating emergency cases and
critically ill patients.
   The strike was expected to have a widespread effect, since most
doctors work in clinics or hospitals under Israel's system of
socialized medicine.
   Nationwide doctors' unions called the strike to protest a court
ruling last week that declared illegal the nearly two-year practice
of giving physicians overtime payments instead of negotiating wage
increases.
   The strike came amid heightened labor unrest organized by the
Labor Party-dominated Histadrut Labor Federation, following
formation of a right-wing government in early June led by the
right-wing Likud bloc.
   The previous government had included the center-left Labor Party.
   As the doctors launched their 24-hour action, electric workers,
defense industry employees and workers in other public sectors
threatened similar action over wage disputes.
   The overtime arrangement was reached in November 1988 to bypass
complicated wage negotiations and to reduce a waiting list of tens
of thousands of Israelis needing operations and other medical care.
   But the arrangement was designed to last only until March of
this year, and the government brought suit to challenge
continuation of the system.
   On Thursday, a Tel Aviv court ruled that under the law, the
overtime system could not serve as a permanent replacement for a
wage agreement.
   There are few private doctors in Israel. Most Israelis pay small
fees for treatment in hospitals and clinics, which are heavily
subsidized by the government.
   The system dates to the country's socialist origins. It has
suffered financial difficulties in recent years because of
inefficiency and Israel's wider economic troubles, such as
double-digit inflation.
   Doctors' basic salaries start at about $600 a month, with
overnight duty shifts adding up to several hundred dollars more to
the wages of many attending physicians.
   With the overtime payments, many doctors have earned an
additional $200 to $300 a month.

   Stargazers and Spy magazine have seen the
future, and its name is _ what else? _ Donald Trump.
   The August issue of Spy, the Trump-bashing monthly that dubbed
The Donald a ``short-fingered vulgarian,'' features an eight-page
spread foreshadowing Trump's fortunes from September 1990 through
April 1996. By then, the magazine predicts, David Geffen will own
Trump Tower and Yoko Ono will run The Plaza.
   The final word: Donald reconciles with Ivana, and they become
co-hosts of the hit TV show ``Lunch With Ivana and Me.'' That's the
good news; the bad news is Trump has put on 50 pounds and lost much
of his hair.
   Astrologically speaking, the future doesn't look much brighter.
``The real problem right now is he has Mercury, Saturn and Venus
all in the sign of Cancer,'' astrologer Joyce Jillson told the
Daily News.
   Thanks, Joyce.
   Jillson predicts one of Trump's Atlantic City casinos is going
to shut down and become a Cadillac dealership. Star-gazer Jeanne
Dixon warns Trump can expect more losses and more money problems by
the end of 1990.
   But at least he has his health, you say. Uhhhh, not so fast.
Jillson forecasts that the Donald can expect an ulcer in the near

   Nelson Mandela raised more than $7 million for
the African National Congress in his eight-city U.S. tour, and
Americans paid millions more in tax dollars for his police
protection.
   While no total for donations was available from national
organizers of the 11-day trip that ended Saturday, organizers in
each city had rough counts as of Monday. Many said money still was
coming in.
   Similarly, no sum of government costs for Mandela's protection
was available. In New York City alone, municipal expenses were put
at $2.6 million. Another big spender was the State Department,
which oversaw security.
   ``There isn't even the remotest guess yet'' as to the federal
expense, said Frank Matthews, spokesman for the State Department's
Bureau of Diplomatic Services. ``It's big, but I don't know how
big.''
   Mandela, freed in February after 27 years in prison, is a leader
of the ANC struggle against apartheid. Fund-raising was a focus of
his tour, and he called for help at events ranging from stadium
rallies to celebrity cocktail parties.
   He fell considerably short of fund-raising goals in some cities
but far exceeded them in others. In Boston, planners raised only
about half the $1 million they sought. In New York, donors may
double their $1 million goal.
   ``When we first heard he was coming to New York, we were
delighted,'' said fund-raiser Suzanne Dubose. ``We knew we could do
a million. But you always think, in the back of your mind _ can the
town pull it together?''
   It did, she said: The Mandela tour has raised $1.75 million in
New York, and late-arriving income makes $2 million a possibility.
   The national total thus far was less than the $1 million per
city that some organizers said was set as a target. Other
participants, however, said they had never adopted a $1 million
goal for their cities.
   While Mandela spent three days in New York, they noted, he had
only a half day in Atlanta, where projections were for roughly
$400,000, and one day in Miami and Miami Beach, where he addressed
a union whose members raised about $300,000. In Boston his largest
rally was free, unlike the paid events elsewhere.
   In Washington, most of his appearances were private meetings
with political leaders. Mandela raised about $150,000 there, much
of it from a stadium rally, said spokeswoman Lisa Alfred.
   Income in Detroit was estimated at $1.4 million and rising, with
help from brisk sales of a videotape account of Mandela's visit.
Preliminary numbers from Los Angeles were $1.7 million, and from
Oakland, Calif., $900,000.
   Leila McDowell, spokeswoman for the tour's national organizing
group, Democracy for South Africa, said it was shocked at the
figures provided by the local committees and called it premature to
release them.
   ``We don't know that they're inaccurate or that they're
accurate,'' she said. ``You get a check, you don't know whether
it's bounced or whether it's real. You get a pledge, you don't know
whether it'll come through or not. They haven't had a chance to do
a full accounting yet.''
   Expenses were yet to be subtracted from the income. But because
much of the facilities and equipment used by the tour were donated
or supplied at a discount, organizers said most of the cash should
reach the ANC.
   In Detroit, for example, expenses were not expected to exceed
$250,000. In Boston and New York, local expenses were estimated at
roughly $150,000 apiece. However, expenses of the national tour
organizers, including air travel and some accommodations, were not
yet available.
   Proceeds _ including sales of T-shirts and buttons _ are to be
deposited in a fund for the ANC. The fund is controlled by the U.S.
directors of the tour, led by Roger Wilkins, a professor at George
Mason University and the trip's chief planner, Alfred said.
   The money will be used to finance 14 offices in South Africa for
the newly legalized ANC, she said. The remainder will go toward
housing and education there.
   As the tour counted its take, municipalities were totaling their
costs, mostly for police overtime. Boston's Metropolitan District
Commission police needed $110,000 in overtime pay; Atlanta police,
an estimated $100,000; Miami police, $20,000. Figures were not
immediately available in other cities.
   New York was the most specific: The city racked up $2 million in
police overtime, $250,000 in Transportation Department charges and
$210,000 for cleanup, and had other assorted costs for a $2.6
million total.
   The city said it would seek reimbursement from a State
Department fund set up to help New York pay for protecting
international leaders visiting the United Nations. The State
Department has resisted, saying Mandela's visit did not meet the
fund's guidelines because he is not a head of state.
   New York officials have found a silver lining nonetheless:
Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch said the combined TV coverage of Mandela in
the city would have cost $720,000 a minute if it were paid
advertising for New York City.
   He said: ``We could not have bought this promotion.''

<HEAD>Audit Critical of Wisconsin's Experimental Welfare Program</HEAD>

   A Wisconsin program that cuts welfare
benefits of families whose children skip school suffers from
serious administrative problems that unfairly penalize some
recipients, a state audit says.
   The findings released Monday drew strong responses from critics
of the experimental Learnfare program, who contend Gov. Tommy G.
Thompson has touted it while hiding its problems.
   ``By all accounts, the Learnfare program has been an
administrative nightmare,'' said state Rep. Peter Barca, ``I'm very
skeptical at this point.''
   Learnfare, authorized by the Legislature in 1987, allows the
state to cut a family's monthly Aid to Families with Dependent
Children benefits if a school reports a student has been
consistently absent without excuse.
   The program applies to teen-agers, but Thompson wants it
expanded to include elementary-school pupils. The federal
government has authorized the expansion but the Legislature still
must approve it.
   Barca said expansion is ``out of the question'' given the audit
findings.
   The audit said attendance measurement practices throughout the
state are inconsistent and errors in paperwork by county social
workers has resulted in some families being penalized without
reason.
   Thompson had not seen the report and had no immediate comment,
his office said Tuesday.
   Learnfare requires cooperation among the state Department of
Health and Social Services, the state Department of Public
Instruction, county social service agencies and school districts,
which keep attendance records.
   ``Unfortunately, cooperation among these agencies has fallen
short of what is needed to ensure adequate program management,''
the report said.
   Students ages 13 to 19 who don't attend classes regularly see
their family's monthly benefits reduced by about $100 until schools
report truancy has ended. The state's average monthly AFDC payment
is $517.
   ``In general, we found that significant weaknesses in
administration of Learnfare lead to some students being sanctioned
who should not have been and other students, who had too many
unexcused absences, not being sanctioned,'' said state auditor Dale
Cattanach.
   In a review of 151 cases in Milwaukee County in February 1990,
it said, 13 cases were inappropriately sanctioned. There were three
instances in which students were truant without their families
being penalized, it said.
   Milwaukee School Superintendent Robert Peterkin said Monday his
district, the state's largest, will design a computerized reporting
system to improve attendance monitoring.
   Thomas Brophy, director of Milwaukee County Social Services,
said in a response letter than his agency ``will make every effort
to correct this problem so that no one is sanctioned incorrectly.''
   Brophy also said he doesn't believe significant improvements can
be made unless his agency receives more money.
   Of the 30,000 students subject to Learnfare, 48 percent live in
Milwaukee County, where 75 percent the sanctions have been imposed,
the report said.

   A massive high-pressure zone kept the weather hot and dry in the
central United States on Tuesday. Temperatures topped 100 degrees
in some states.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell mainly over the Southeast, from
Florida and southern Georgia to southeastern Louisiana.
   In Jacksonville, Fla., thunderstorms dropped an inch of rain in
the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation. A few
showers fell in northern Maine, upper Michigan, New Mexico and
Arizona.
   Skies were mostly sunny from California to Montana, from Texas
and Louisiana to South Dakota and Iowa, and from Mississippi and
Alabama to West Virginia.
   The high-pressure center kept out clouds, rain and cooler air to
the north.
   By afternoon, temperatures were in the 90s across the southern
and central Plains and the lower and middle Mississippi Valley.
Readings of 100 degrees or above were reported in South Dakota,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   At 2 p.m. EDT, it was 104 degrees in Wichita, Kan., and 103 in
Mitchell, S.D.
   Strong southerly winds prevailed from the southern High Plains
to the middle and upper Mississippi Valley.
   More seasonable temperatures were forecast for much of the
northern High Plains. Afternoon temperatures were only in the 70s
from Montana and northern Wyoming to central North Dakota.
   Afternoon temperatures were mostly in the upper 70s and 80s in
the Great Lakes region and the eastern United States. Temperatures
were in the 60s in Washington state and Oregon and along the
northern and central Pacific Coast. But readings in the
southwestern deserts were in the 90s or above 100.
   Three cities in the West and one in the South tied their record
low temperatures for the date. It was 39 degrees in Yakima, Wash.;
40 in Boise, Idaho; 42 in Spokane, Wash.; and 56 in Bristol, Tenn.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 37 degrees at Baker, Ore.,
and Redmond, Ore.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney stands by his
opposition to the purchase of V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft for
the Marine Corps despite a new study indicating it would be a good
investment, a spokesman said Tuesday.
   ``The secretary has concluded that the decision that he made
last year remains valid,'' spokesman Pete Williams told reporters.
``That is, that the V-22 is an excellent aircraft, but is simply
too expensive to buy.''
   The Institute for Defense Analysis, a Pentagon-sponsored
research group, said in a report to Congress on Friday that the
Osprey could perform better on military missions and do so at less
cost than helicopter alternatives favored by Cheney.
   Williams said Cheney disagrees with assumptions on which the
report is based.
   The Osprey would be built jointly by Boeing Helicopters of
Philadelphia and Bell Helicopter@Textron of Fort Worth, Texas.
   It is designed to rise and hover like a helicopter and then fly
like an airplane. It would be used largely for military-transport
missions.
   Williams said Cheney still believes ``the Marine Corps medium
airlift requirement can be met by alternatives that cost less.''
   The institute said costs could be reduced by slowing the rate of
production of the Ospreys.
   Even at the reduced rate, however, Williams said the Ospreys
would cost about $3.7 billion more, during fiscal years 1991
through 1997, than Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III
recommended be spent on medium airlift.
   The report also assumed that the Marine Corps could get by with
fewer of the Ospreys than originally proposed by flying more
sorties at higher speeds.
   Williams said it was not known whether the aircraft could carry
equipment slung under it at the proposed speed of 200 knots, or
whether the vehicles and other equipment would survive being
carried at this speed.
   Williams also said the study appeared to overestimate the
near-term investment cost of helicopters.
   The Pentagon had once hoped to eventually buy about 650 Ospreys.
Members of Congress from Texas and Pennsylvania, with jobs at stake
in their states, have been among strong backers of the aircraft.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said on Sunday, ``Once this report is
in hand, with these conclusions, it is no longer possible for
Cheney to say credibly that the V-22 is more expensive than
alternatives.''

   George Bush was back on his leash
and wolfing down bananas Tuesday after taking an unscheduled
two-day vacation.
   This George Bush, however, is a 3-year-old white-faced Capuchin
monkey used by Joe Bush, a 49-year-old Willingboro organ grinder
who is not related to the president. The monkey broke his leash
while his owner showed him off during a vsit Saturday with friends.
   The escape set off a two-day search by at least 100 residents in
the southern New Jersey township for the 16-inch-high, 6-pound
namesake of the president.
   ``One guy told me he was trying to catch him and George was
flying from treetop to treetop like he had been doing it all his
life,'' Bush said Tuesday.
   George's stomach finally overcame his urge for freedom when he
emerged from the woods Monday morning to eat some tomatoes in a
yard. About 30 or 40 residents surrounded the monkey and Bush
caught him.
   ``It was a traumatic experience,'' Bush said, noting that George
in September replaced another monkey that he had used for 16 years.
``But he's acting like nothing happened. ... He was like a young
teen-ager getting freedom.''
   As for the monkey's ties to the man at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,
Bush said, ``I just say it's a distant cousin.''

   President Bush said Tuesday NATO
allies are expressing ``wide acceptance'' for his pre-summit
proposals on nuclear strategy changes. His plans include an
alliance commitment not to use nuclear weapons except as a last
resort, other officials said.
   Bush leaves Wednesday for the two-day NATO summit beginning
Thursday in London, and he has been telephoning leaders of the
alliance's other countries in advance of the meeting.
   The president, blending work with golf and other relaxation
during a five-day break at his oceanfront summer home, planned to
take in the local fireworks Tuesday night from the deck of the U.S.
Coast Guard training barque Eagle.
   NATO's basic doctrine since 1967 has been that it would not rule
out using nuclear weapons first if confronted with an invasion by
superior conventional forces from the Soviet Union or its
satellites.
   However, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said Tuesday
``the collapse'' of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact justified changes in
that ``flexible response'' policy.
   Scowcroft, with Bush in Maine, said the president had sent a
letter to NATO leaders trying to line up support for the changes.
   He gave few specifics, but administration officials aid
privately that the Bush plan would commit the 16-nation alliance to
ease their nuclear-weapons stance at least to the extent of calling
for use only as a last resort.
   Bush also steered clear of details as he met with reporters
outside his vacation home. But he said, ``The general approach that
we're proposing seems to be getting wide acceptance.''
   Scowcroft, at a later news briefing, said the summit takes place
``at a moment of significant historic transition'' in Europe.
   The overriding issue is how to adapt the Western alliance to
``the changing security environment in Europe,'' including ``the
collapse ... of the Warsaw Pact, the changes in Eastern Europe
(and) the turmoil that's going on in the Soviet Union,'' Scowcroft
said.
   He said NATO's strategy must recognize that ``shortly'' there
will no longer ``be armies facing each other directly across a
boundary.''
   Instead, he said, the United States is looking for the Soviets
to withdraw their troops from Eastern Europe. He added, ``It's a
very different matter to attack a few hundred yards across a border
than it is to move forces up several hundred miles into Eastern
Europe to be prepared for an attack.''
   ``One has to look at the issues of forward defense, flexible
response, all the kinds of strategies that NATO pursues now to see
how they might be modified to fit those new circumstances,'' said
the national security adviser.
   He said Bush's proposals are not ``bombshells, but they are
significant because this is a significant time.'' Scowcroft said
the United States already has gotten favorable reactions from
``five or six'' NATO allies.
   Bush conferred at his oceanfront home Tuesday with Vice
President Dan Quayle, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Trade
Representative Carla Hills and other senior officials to prepare
for next Monday's economic summit in Houston. Bush will fly to
Texas from Europe late Friday.
   Bush said he hoped the economic summit, bringing together the
leaders of the world's seven largest industrialized nations, would
bring progress on trade.
   Before that, the NATO allies are holding their third summit in
the past year as the alliance prepares to welcome a new, united
Germany into its ranks _ a move that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev staunchly opposes.
   Bush said he hopes the NATO summit will help persuade the
Soviets that a unified Germany in NATO is no threat to the Soviet
Union. He said, ``If there are certain things we can do to expand
NATO's role that drive that point home, so much the better.''
   While sympathetic to Gorbachev's problems at home, Bush
reiterated Tuesday that he remains opposed to Western economic aid
for the Soviet Union, a subject sure to come up at one or both of
the summits.
   Scowcroft said, ``I think the Soviets will be looking at this
summit very carefully.''
   ``It's a difficult issue for the Soviet Union. Not only is their
alliance collapsing and the kind of defense barrier to their west
that they count on for 40 years, but the sort of crown jewel of
that defensive barrier is now being proposed to join the core of an
alliance that I'm sure they tell their little children is evil
incarnate,'' Scowcroft said.
   In addition to agreeing to use nuclear weapons only as a last
resort, administration officials say Bush has suggested other moves
to overcome Soviet anxieties, including eventually scrapping the
1,470 U.S. nuclear-tipped artillery shells now based mostly in West
Germany, reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1,560 U.S. nuclear
bombs deployed in seven NATO countries and pulling back troops from
forward deployment.

   President Corazon Aquino found
herself politically isolated Tuesday, as congressional leaders
urged her to let Imelda Marcos return home after a U.S. court
acquitted her of looting this nation's treasury.
   Longtime Aquino supporters joined Marcos loyalists in calling
for the former first lady's return. But Mrs. Aquino refused to
relax the ban and accused Mrs. Marcos of supporting a coup attempt
in December.
   On Monday, a federal jury in New York cleared Mrs. Marcos on
charges that she used $222 million in Philippine government funds
to buy real estate, art and jewelry. She fled the country with her
husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, after the 1986 ``people
power'' revolution toppled his regime and propelled Mrs. Aquino
into the presidency.
   ``The acquittal does not alter the national interest and
security grounds on which we have premised our decision not to
allow the return of Mrs. Marcos at the present time,'' Mrs. Aquino
said.
   That effectively rules out for now prosecuting Mrs. Marcos in
the Philippines because the nation's constitution forbids trials in
absentia.
   In a second statement Tuesday, Mrs. Aquino said intelligence
reports showed that Mrs. Marcos ``encouraged and supported those
who wanted to grab power'' during the Dec. 1-9 military coup
attempt, in which 113 people were killed and more than 600 injured.
   ``The return of Mrs. Marcos would enable her to mobilize the
underground network of the Marcos dictatorship which is designed to
overthrow this government and endanger our democratic gains and
economic momentum,'' Mrs. Aquino said.
   In a telephone interview with Manila radio station DZBB, Mrs.
Marcos said: ``I am not opposing Mrs. Aquino. I am not going to
fight her. What I will do is just pray to the Lord that I be
allowed to come home. I know that He will grant me this, just like
my acquittal.''
   Despite Mrs. Aquino's stand, most key leaders of the Senate and
House of Representatives said Mrs. Marcos should be allowed to
return, if only to stand trial.
   House Speaker Ramon Mitra said Mrs. Marcos should never have
been tried abroad and that ``it is important that the arm of the
law gets hold of her and she gets her day in court.''
   ``In my view, Mrs. Marcos should be allowed to present her
defense before Philippine courts,'' said Senate President Jovito
Salonga, who was jailed by Marcos. ``This would be a good test of
our judicial system and its ability to render speedy, impartial
justice.''
   Senate Majority Leader Teofisto Guingona said ``unless I am
shown specific proof that there is really danger to national
security, I would back allowing Mrs. Marcos to defend herself
personally here.''
   The government has frequently accused the Marcos family of
supporting moves to oust Mrs. Aquino but has offered little proof.
In February, Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido claimed he asked Mrs.
Marcos to finance the December coup attempt but she declined
because of financial problems.
   On Tuesday, officials said they were ready to prosecute Mrs.
Marcos and were simply waiting for a go-ahead from Mrs. Aquino.
   ``We can still proceed with (charges) insofar as violations of
Philippine laws are concerned,'' said Justice Secretary Franklin
Drilon. ``This is a political decision. This means President Aquino
decides on this.''
   The Aquino government claims Marcos and his associates stole $10
billion dollars during his 20 years in power.
   But the government has never charged any member of the Marcos
family with criminal offenses for fear they would demand their
right to return from exile to face their accusers.
   Marcos died in September in Hawaii, but Mrs. Aquino cited
national security in refusing permission for the former president
to be buried in his homeland. She also refused to allow members of
Marcos' immediate family to return.
   Some people suspect that personal bitterness between the two
women plays a more important role than national security in the
decision to bar Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno, was slain upon returning home in
1983 to challenge Marcos.
   In addition, allowing Mrs. Marcos to return home now could be
perilous for Mrs. Aquino, whose own popularity is at a low ebb.
   Despite calls for prosecuting Mrs. Marcos here, it seems
unlikely that a trial could be completed by June 1992, when Mrs.
Aquino's term expires.
   The trial of 40 people in the Benigno Aquino assassination began
in April 1987 and is still in progress. Ordinary criminal trials
often take years to complete.

   Thousands of rain-soaked protesters chanted ``Down
with the Communist Party!'' at a rally Tuesday evening across town
from the ruling party's congress in the Kremlin.
   Dozens of red, white and blue flags of czarist Russia waved in
the crowd of more than 4,000 people who gathered in a steady rain
outside the main gate of Gorky Park. They listened to radical
politicians and artists _ such as poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko and
theater director Yuri Lyubimov _ denounce Communism.
   ``Down with the bandits who captured power in 1917!'' shouted
Moscow City Council member Valery Fadeyev, to the cheers of the
crowd, which arrived in a steady late afternoon rain that turned
into a muggy summer evening.
   Progressive magazine editor Vitaly Korotich compared the
pro-democracy rally to the crucial 28th Communist Party Congress
meeting in the plush Palace of Congresses.
   ``One is under a nice roof and under air conditioning in the
Kremlin and another one is under the rain here,'' said Korotich,
editor of the popular magazine Ogonyok. ``If we will be able to
collect and support one another in the rain, we'll be stronger than
the others, who want to put fear in us.''
   The crowd cheered lustily at any mention of Boris Yeltsin, the
radical president of the Russian republic, who was not present. It
whistled derisively at references to the KGB secret police and
conservative leaders.
   Besides the czarist flags, a Lithuanian and Ukrainian banners
also waved, as did the all-black standard of the anarchists. Not
one hammer-and-sickle was present _ except on a placard that showed
the Communist symbol evolving into a swastika with the skulls of
the dead below it.
   Fadeyev drew shouts of ``Well done!'' as he noted the Moscow
City Council had removed a bust of Lenin from its chambers. ``We
also put up the tri-color Russian flag, and hope that this flag _
our own flag _ will become the symbol of free Russia.''
   Yevtushenko drew laughter when he read a poem that ridiculed the
Communist system and compared it to a ``little piglet that sucked
on the breast of the nation and bit it.''
   Lyubimov told the rally: ``I think these are horrible times and
we are not really aware of the depths we have fallen into.''
   He paraphrased Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, saying,
``that for 40 years, we served a totalitarian regime and each of us
is guilty. We served this horrible machine. And we have become like
beasts, all of us.''
   Lyubimov said the Communist leaders have ``not a shadow of
intellect'' in their faces and ``cannot even speak Russian.''
   To the crowd's delight, he then mocked the southern accent of
Soviet leaders since Stalin _ including Mikhail S. Gorbachev _ and
especially made fun of the wheezing of the late Leonid I. Brezhnev,
who in his final years slurred his words badly.
   Drawing some of the biggest cheers of the rally was Oleg
Kalugin, a former KGB agent who has joined the Democratic Platform
reform movement. On Saturday, it was announced that Gorbachev
stripped him of his rank of major general two weeks after he told
Western reporters that the KGB still is tapping telephones,
infiltrating religious and union organizations, and carrying out
dirty tricks.
   Kalugin said at the rally that during his years assigned to the
United States, he learned to respect activists in the civil rights
movement and protesters against the Vietnam War.
   ``Yes, America affected me to the extent that I witnessed the
revelations about the CIA and FBI, which, like the KGB, oppressed
the people, suppressed dissent, used criminal methods,'' he said.
``And I saw the American people struggle against it without fear of
possible losses.''
   Of being stripped of his military rank by Gorbachev, Kalugin
said: ``I am still a soldier _ of the army of freedom.''

<HEAD>Federal Panel Blames Pilot For Sliding Airliner Into East River</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board said
Tuesday that the pilot of USAir Flight 5050 probably caused his
jetliner to skid into New York's East River, killing two passengers.
   The board, ruling 4-0, said pilot Michael Martin made several
mistakes while attempting to take off from LaGuardia Airport last
Sept. 20 and then in aborting the takeoff.
   Among the errors, the NTSB said, were:
   _Martin's failure to detect an improperly positioned rudder trim
control. Correctly set, the control sets the rudder to a neutral,
or straight back, position. The knob on Martin's Boeing 737 had
somehow been set to full left rudder.
   _His failure to realize that, even with the knob incorrectly
set, he could have taken off by adjusting other controls.
   _His failure to carry out standard precautions and procedures
for aborting a takeoff.
   The plane skidded off the runway and landed in the river,
splitting apart. The 61 survivors were rescued from the river.
   The Air Line Pilots Association called the board's determination
of probable cause in the crash ``a total travesty'' and said it
would ask the NTSB to reconsider its finding. The union said the
design of the knob itself was to blame.
   NTSB board member John Lauber said investigators had been
reluctant to lay all of the blame for the crash on Martin. But
Lauber said the pilot's performance on the LaGuardia airport runway
showed so many lapses that the decision was justified.
   While the NTSB said investigators could not determine how the
trim control had been improperly set, the board in the past has
found 90 incidents on 737s in which the knob had been incorrectly
set.
   Boeing and safety officials have determined that the knob could
be accidentally moved by cockpit visitors putting their feet on the
console between the pilot and copilot or by laying a book or other
object on the console.
   Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have called for
changes in the trim control knobs on all of the more than 600
Boeing 737s in use.
   The NTSB also said Martin used poor judgment in letting copilot
Constantin Kleissas attempt the takeoff on a dark, rainy night,
even though he was certified to fly the plane. Kleissas had never
before had the controls of a commercial 737.
   Martin also failed to follow the standard procedure of calling
out air speeds to his copilot as the plane moved down the runway.
   As the plane's speed increased, it began drifting to the left,
at which point Martin told Kleissas he was taking the controls and
aborting the takeoff. But the NTSB said Martin had not made himself
clear and Kleissas wasn't sure what was happening.
   Once the decision to abort was made, the board said, Martin
improperly tried to control the plane by steering with the
nosewheel instead of the rudder.
   In addition, investigators said the pilot had failed during
preparations for the flight to ensure that the plane's automatic
braking system was set to engage in the event the takeoff was
aborted.
   In summary, the board said, ``The probable cause of this
accident was the captain's failure to exercise his command
authority in a timely manner to reject the takeoff or take
sufficient control to continue the takeoff, which was initiated
with a mistrimmed rudder.''
   Bob Benzon, the NTSB investigator in charge of the crash, said
simulator tests had showed that with proper pilot decisions the
plane could either have stopped safely on the runway or could have
taken off, even with the rudder trim error.
   Martin and Kleissas both had their licenses suspended by the
FAA, which was critical of their failure to appear for drug tests
after the crash. Both, however, have dropped their appeals of the
suspensions and can fly again if they pass recertification tests.
   Board member Jim Burnett joined in the 4-0 vote but filed an
additional assertion that USAir's failure to assign ``an adequately
prepared and seasoned flight crew'' was a contributing factor in
the crash.
   Burnett said the board did not cite design of the control knob
as a factor because the pilot had so many chances to discover and
correct it and because Boeing and the FAA already had ordered
changes to be made on all 737s to correct the problem.

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan said Tuesday
he is asking officials to avoid all but ``necessary and
productive'' dealings with the AIDS activist group ACT UP.
   Members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) led a
noisy demonstration that drowned out Sullivan's speech at an AIDS
conference in San Francisco last month and pelted him with wads of
paper and other objects as he spoke.
   Through a spokesman, Sullivan repeated that he will not deal
with ``people who behave as ACT UP did.''
   ``Whatever dealings that other parts of the department have, we
just want to make sure that they are necessary and productive. We
will not let the department be used as a punching bag by ACT UP or
any other group. We are determined to work together in the fight
against AIDS,'' his statement said.
   James Brown, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, which
oversees the bulk of the AIDS research and education efforts in the
department, said he could not give an example of the kind of
communication that might be cut off.
   ``It would have to be determined issue by issue,'' he said.
   Much, however, will remain the same, he said. For example, ACT
UP members who sit on department advisory panels will not be
removed and ACT UP's advice will be sought when ``necessary and
productive,'' Brown said.
   Larry Kramer, founder of ACT UP, said in a telephone interview
from his New York home that Sullivan's response only inflames
already bad relations between him and the group's members.
   ``To Dr. Sullivan I say this: Your presence has been so
negligible and you have done so little for us that whether you
decide to work with or us or not with us is irrelevant.''
   Kramer said the group has been assured that its relationship
with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
which does most of the government's AIDS research, ``is still a
productive one.''

<TEXT>
   A congressman called Tuesday for infant
formula makers to reduce their prices by 30 percent to prevent
thousands of women and babies from being dropped from a
federally-funded feeding program.
   Infant formula prices have skyrocketed by nearly 150 percent in
the last 10 years, surpassing milk price increases of 36.4 percent,
grocery increases of 50.8 percent, and the 59.1 percent rate of
inflation, said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.
   ``The manufacturers of infant formula are gouging mothers who
desperately need to feed their babies,'' said Wyden.
   About a third of the formula sold in this country goes to
mothers enrolled in the Special Supplemental Feeding Program for
Women, Infants and Children.
   Wyden said he wrote to the chief operating officers of the five
leading formula makers asking fr price reductions. They are Ross
Laboratories, makers of Similac; Mead Johnson, makers of Enfamil;
American Home Products, makers of SMA; Carnation, makers of Great
Start; and Worthington Foods, makers of Soyalac.
   Wyden said the two largest companies, Ross Laboratories and Mead
Johnson have raised their prices 12 times since 1981.
   Spokesmen at American Home Products, the third largest infant
formula maker, and Ross Laboratories said they had not seen Wyden's
letter and would not comment.
   ``The letter is dated July 3. It was received this afternoon at
about 4:45 p.m. The person to whom it was addressed is not here. We
have not read it and are not able to comment beyond that,'' said
Jerry Parrott, spokesman for Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., of which
Mead Johnson is a subsidiary.
   Congress voted last week to allow states to borrow 3 percent
against next year's appropriation. Advocates said the move was
necessary because rising costs of food have caused states to start
cutting participants.
   Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, said that even with the borrowing capacity 15 states
will have to eliminate participants.
   ``To be sure, these states will remove significantly fewer
participants than would have been the case if the legislation had
not passed,'' said Greenstein. ``However, some tens of thousands
will still be dropped _ perhaps as many as 100,000 overall.''

<HEAD>Air Controllers' Strike Hits France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers, complaining they are
overworked and underpaid, began a three-day strike Tuesday that
forced cancellation of about two-thirds of all flights in and out
of Paris at the start of the summer vacation season.
   About 90 percent of the controllers at France's largest flight
control center, Athis-Mons, south of Paris, reportedly joined the
strike.
   The Dutch airline KLM and Swissair were among the foreign
carriers that announced they were either canceling all flights into
Paris for the duration of the strike or reducing them drastically.
   British Airways said it canceled 14 services between Heathrow
airport and Paris.
   Air France and the French domestic carrier, Air Inter, said they
were reducing short and medium-haul flights by 60 percent. Air
France said it would maintain its long-haul flights.
   Officials warned that delays should be expected.
   The strike disrupted some other flights over Western Europe
because Athis-Mons controls the air space over northern France used
on those routes.
   Strikers cited increased air traffic, understaffing and the high
cost of living in the Paris area in demanding compensating bonuses.
   In a letter to controllers, Transport Minister Michel Delebarre
expressed his ``profound disagreement'' with the strike, saying it
would ``seriously penalize French and foreign users, and notably
those going on vacation.''

   The judge in Mayor Marion Barry's drug case
argued Tuesday that he is entitled to bar Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan and a dissident Roman Catholic priest from the
trial because their presence probably would intimidate witnesses
and jurors.
   The Justice Department, in a separate filing, supported Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson's contention that neither Barry, Farrakhan
nor George Augustus Stallings is legally entitled to ask for relief
from the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit on
behalf of Barry, Farrakhan and Stallings, will respond Wednesday to
the Justice and Jackson filings, said local ACLU legal director
Arthur Spitzer.
   When he barred Farrakhan from the courtroom last Wednesday,
Jackson said that the Muslim leader's presence ``would be
potentially disruptive and very likely intimidating.'' He cited the
same reasoning in denying Stallings entry to the proceedings.
   In his submission to the appeals court, the judge wrote,
``Farrakhan and Stallings, by reason of their extraordinary
publicity and their widely known and highly controversial views on
matters directly pertainting to the ongoing trial, would be likely
to send an impermissible `message' to, and to distract, disrupt and
intimidate, both jurors and witnesses.''
   Barry can take up the matter with the appeals court if appeals a
conviction in his drug possession and perjury case, the judge wrote.
   ``Revs. Farrakhan and Stallings are not parties to any case or
proceeding in the District Court,'' Jackson wrote. ``It follows
that, because there is no proper jurisdiction in this court for
(them) ... there is no valid basis for any requested `relief.'''
   ``District courts posess considerable discretion to exclude
specific spectators in order to ensure that jurors and witnesses
are free of distraction, disruption, and intimidation,'' the judge
added.
   Jackson concluded that his actions were ``well within (my)
discretion under the unique circumstances'' that Barry's trial has
produced.
   The judge announced his decision to exclude Farrakhan and
Stallings while the jury in Barry's case was outside the courtroom.
In both instances, Barry had sought to give one of his special
guest passes to the men.
   In his initial filing, Spitzer argued that Jackson must present
proof that Farrakhan and Stallings would disrupt the trial. He also
claimed that Jackson's order violated the mayor's constitutional
right to a public trial.
   But the Justice Department wrote that since ``the press and
members of the public are allowed to attend all proceedings, ...
defendant Barry's right to a public trial is preserved.''
   About a dozen of Farrakhan's followers have protested Jackson's
actions outside the courthouse this week, while Stallings has
decried Jackson's decision as well.
   The story has become a sidelight in Barry's case; both Farrakhan
and Stallings, who are black, claim that they have been excluded
from the proceedings because of their race. Barry and his backers
have been suggesting for months that the case against the mayor was
racially motivated.
   Thirteen of the 18 jurors are black.
   Jackson, who is white, has refused to comment on the matter
outside his legal filings.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's hard-line Kremlin
colleagues on Tuesday sharply attacked his reforms of the ailing
Soviet economy, politics, the military and diplomacy.
   ``There are forces in our country fighting against socialist
order, against the Communist Party,'' warned conservative Politburo
member Yegor K. Ligachev, rejecting attacks on party hard-liners
and their allies in the army.
   His remarks drew thunderous applause from the 4,657 delegates at
the 28th Communist Party congress. Gorbachev, the party general
secretary and president, sat stone-faced behind the speaker's
platform in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses.
   Opponents, Ligachev said, ``applaud things that are directed
toward the breakup of socialism in our country, toward undermining
the party, presenting them as innovations, as real perestroika.''
   Gorbachev told the delegates that four top party officials
submitted their resignations, further undermining the traditional
public unity of the collective Kremlin leadership. Gorbachev
increasingly has been the target of public criticism by his
colleagues.
   The four officials included non-voting politburo member
Alexandra Biryukova, the highest-ranking woman in the leadership.
She was responsible for consumer goods, and Gorbachev gave no
reason for her resignation.
   Gorbachev's critics did not mention him by name, in keeping with
tradition. But the resignations and the abuse heaped on his
policies raised doubts that he has enough support at the top to
push further reforms.
   When the 10-day congress is over, it will have elected a party
leader and Central Committee, and will have approved a new platform
and party rules.
   The harsh speeches by Gorbachev's colleagues on the ruling
Politburo _ the first allowed at a congress of this type since 1921
_ were televised nationally after a delay.
   A Gorbachev ally, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,
praised the reforms, and countered conservative criticism that he
had signed unfavorable arms control treaties with the West and too
much was cut from the military budget.
   Gorbachev appeared unperturbed by the criticism. Acting as
congress chairman, he cracked jokes and laughed.
   After Communist leaders aired their differences, about 4,000
reformers gathered across the Moscow River and gave the congress a
bad review. Braving a steady rain, they rallied at the main gate of
Gorky Park, shouting, ``Down with the Communist Party!'' and ``Down
with the KGB!''
   Many waved the red, white and blue flags of czarist Russia.
   Inside the red brick walls of the Kremlin, the 69-year-old
Ligachev railed against three of Gorbachev's reforms: his plan to
put factories and farms in private hands, his farm investment
policy and his anti-alcoholism campaign, which has been abandoned.
   Ligachev also said Gorbachev's 5-year-old perestroika reform
program was marred by ``limitless radicalism'' and
``improvisations'' that have brought little good.
   KGB Chairman Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, in a speech laden with
Marxist-Leninist ideology, criticized economic reforms he said have
produced ``property stratification'' among the population and ``a
whole layer of millionaires.''
   He said some people want to import capitalism, bringing with it
the many ills of that system.
   ``We hear assertions that in the West, everything is good and
here everything is bad. We are drawn to Western experience. ... But
can we allow that along with useful experience, the negative in the
world of capital has also been transferred into our life?''
   He listed the ills as mass unemployment, rampant crime and drug
abuse.
   Gorbachev repeatedly has praised Western economies, especially
during his trip to the United States last month, for providing
incentives to workers and fostering high living standards.
   Another conservative, Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, rejected
demands by Communist reformers to eliminate party cells in the
armed forces.
   ``That would be very harmful,'' he told the delegates, including
some military officers. Yazov wore his green marshal's uniform
emblazoned with several rows of medals.
   Shevardnadze made a spirited defense of perestroika, and
rejected charges of ``concessions in the security arena.''
   ``If we continue as we did, to spend one-quarter of the gross
national income on military spending, we will ruin the country and
we will simply not need any defense any more,'' the white-haired
diplomat said. ``A ruined country and poor people do not need an
army.''
   Shevardnadze praised Soviet policy in Eastern Europe, where
since last August new governments have replaced what he called
``forced and alien administrative-command systems, totalitarian
regimes.''
   ``We sensed that if there were not changes, there would be
tragedy,'' he said.
   Ligachev later told reporters in the lobby that the loss of
Eastern Europe ``doesn't strengthen our position, but weakens it.''
   Shevardnadze was applauded, but not nearly as much as Ligachev.
   In a remark that ran counter to Soviet tradition, Shevardnadaze
said he did not see why the foreign minister should sit on the
Politburo.
   Some changes in the Politburo were already in the works. In
addition to Biryukova, two full Politburo members, Nikolai N.
Slyunkov and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, have submitted their
resignations, Gorbachev announced.
   Gumer I. Usmanov, who sits on the party secretariat, also
signaled his intention to resign. Gorbachev said Usmanov and
Slyunkov were ill. Vorotnikov recently lost a job that carried
nearly automatic inclusion on the Politburo, that of President of
the Russian Federation. The resignations have not yet been accepted.

<HEAD>Judge Says He has Authority to Bar Muslim Leader From Barry Trial</HEAD>

   The judge in Mayor Marion Barry's drug trial
told an appeals court Tuesday that he is entitled to bar Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and an excommunicated Roman Catholic
priest from the courtroom.
   ``District courts possess considerable discretion to exclude
specific spectators in order to ensure that jurors and witnesses
are free of distraction, disruption, and intimidation,'' U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson wrote in court papers
supporting his decision.
   The Justice Department, in a separate filing, supported
Jackson's contention that Barry, Farrakhan nor George Augustus
Stallings could legally seek relief from the U.S. District Court of
Appeals.
   The bar against Farrakhan and Stallings, whose break with the
Roman Catholic Church has brought him widespread publicity, has
become a sidelight of Barry's three-week-old trial. Barry
supporters have called it evidence that the mayor is being
persecuted by the government because he is black.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the suit on
behalf of Barry, Farrakhan and Stallings, will respond Wednesday to
the government and Jackson filings, said local ACLU legal director
Arthur Spitzer.
   Farrakhan was barred from entering the courtroom as Barry's
guest last Wednesday. The judge said the Muslim leader's presence
``would be potentially disruptive and very likely intimidating.''
He cited the same reasoning in denying Stallings entry on Thursday.
   In his court papers, Jackson wrote that Barry could take up the
matter with the appeals court if he is convicted in his drug and
perjury trial and then appeals.
   And he said he was using his authority to keep the courtroom
proceedings moving smoothly.
   Jackson announced his decision to exclude Farrakhan and
Stallings while the jury was outside the courtroom. In both
instances, Barry had sought to give one of his four special guest
passes to the men.
   Jackson concluded that his actions were ``well within (my)
discretion under the unique circumstances'' that Barry's trial has
produced.
   Barry has appeared to prolonged applause at public events
recently with both Farrakhan and Stallings, who contend they have
been excluded from the courtroom because they are black.
   In his initial filing, Spitzer argued that Jackson must show
proof that the men would disrupt the trial. He also claimed that
Jackson's order violated the mayor's constitutional right to a
public trial.
   But the Justice Department wrote that since ``the press and
members of the public are allowed to attend all proceedings, ...
defendant Barry's right to a public trial is preserved.''
   About a dozen of Farrakhan's followers have protested Jackson's
actions outside the courthouse this week, and Stallings has also
decried Jackson's decision.
   Jackson, who is white, has refused to comment on the matter
outside his legal filings.

<HEAD>Witness: Barry Vetoed Contract After She Vetoed Sex</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout; Moore's testimony concluded; detail on
alleged sex request; DELETES last 5 grafs to tighten</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

   Rasheeda Moore testified at Marion Barry's
drug and perjury trial Tuesday that she lost a city contract in
1988 because she refused the mayor's request for oral sex. She said
Barry told her ``You refuse, therefore you refuse the contract.''
   Finishing five days of testimony, the woman who aided the FBI
sting against Barry said the contract had been speedily approved in
1986 ``because the mayor told me it would be.''
   Moore answered prosecution questions seeking to counter Barry
defense attempts to show the mayor was illegally enticed into
smoking crack cocaine the night of his arrest.
   Moore said she turned Barry down at a downtown Washington hotel
where they and another woman, Maria McCarthy, had been using drugs
and discussing Moore's contract for a program to build self-esteem
in city teenagers.
   After she rejected the mayor's sexual advance, Barry told her
``because I refused, `I can't promise you the program this year,'''
Moore testified.
   ``My contract had not been signed'' and approved by city
officials, Moore said of her conversation with the mayor. ``I asked
him if he could make some calls.''
   ``He did ask me to have oral sex with him,'' Moore testified
later in the day.
   ``Did you comply?'' asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin.
   ``No,'' said Moore.
   Barry then told Moore, ``You refuse, therefore you refuse the
contract,'' Moore testified.
   The $180,000 contract for Project Me was not renewed that year,
said Moore.
   She said the incident took place in the summer of 1988 at the
Vista Hotel soon after she ended her sexual relationship with the
three-term mayor. The hotel was later the site of Barry's Jan. 18
arrest for allegedly using crack cocaine.
   Barry lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy brought out earlier grand jury
testimony in which Moore said she had been heavily involved with
drugs in the summer of 1988 and was in no condition to carry out
the program. But she also testified about the sex aspect to the
grand jury.
   Barry, 54, is facing 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession charges,
one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and three felony counts
of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
   Moore has said the two used drugs together more than 100 times
between 1986 and 1988.
   Moore also recanted earlier testimony that she had violated FBI
instructions in the sting operation that led to Barry's arrest.
   She had admitted to Mundy last Friday that she ``overcarried''
FBI instructions by steering her conversation with Barry to drugs
and that she twice invited Barry to come up to her room.
   But on Tuesday, she said Barry was eager to meet with her at the
hotel and that he brought up the subject of drugs the minute he
walked in her hotel room.
   ``Is it still your testimony that you went beyond your
instructions,'' asked Retchin.
   ``No, it's not,'' said Moore.
   Mundy, attacking Moore's motives and credibility, said she has
received more than $32,000 in aid from the government. But that
allowed Moore, under later prosecution questioning, to tell jurors
she was in the Justice Department's witness protection program
because the government contends it has evidence a $100,000 contract
has been put out on her life.
   The jury was told that Barry had nothing to do with that threat
against Moore's life.
   And Retchin, countering Mundy's suggestion that Barry was merely
led along by Moore, asked her in a series of questions whether she
helped Barry use crack cocaine during the sting.
   ``No, I did not,'' Moore said.
   Moore also told jurors that before the sting, she told the FBI
the mayor used code words for drug use, including the phrase ``mess
around.'' Moore has contended Barry raised the subject of drugs the
night of his arrest when he asked her whether an undercover FBI
agent posing as a friend of Moore's would ``mess around.''

   Engineers on both coasts will begin tests
after the Fourth of July to find the mysterious fuel leaks that
have grounded America's space shuttle fleet for an indefinite time.
   ``We don't expect the stand-down to be extensive,'' NASA's space
flight chief, William Lenoir, said Tuesday. But he conceded that,
``We don't know exactly how long it's going to be.''
   A 17-inch fuel line removed from the shuttle Columbia was
brought to shuttle builder Rockwell International in California for
the tests, along with the complicated hardware that connects the
line to the orbiter and its huge tank.
   The shuttle Atlantis still is on the launch pad at the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida awaiting a sequence of tests being worked
out this week. Both shuttles leaked supercold liquid hydrogen as
their tanks were being filled recently, causing their launches to
be postponed.
   The fuel transfer system also includes a four-inch pipe used to
pressurize the tank and a two-inch line that pumps helium early in
the fueling process.
   The pipes are in two parts, one half attached to the orbiter,
the other to the fuel tank. They are connected until eight minutes
into a flight when the tank is empty and jettisoned. The half on
the orbiter is reused; the other half is destroyed with the tank.
   Engineers have detected leaks in both the 17-inch and 4-inch
lines, but don't know exactly where, Lenoir said. The leaks show
only when the liquid hydrogen, is flowing through the pipes at
minus 431 degrees Fahrenheit.
   ``On the 4-inch side, there is a leak but it may be within
specifications, which means we don't have a concern with it,''
Lenoir said. ``It would appear there is a more significant problem
with the 17-inch and that's where we ought to focus our attention.''
   The tests in Downey will be conducted first with gaseous helium,
then gaseous nitrogen, then gaseous hydrogen, Lenoir said. If that
doesn't reveal the leak, engineers will use liquid nitrogen and
finally liquid hydrogen.
   The fuel lines and fittings from the tanks on Columbia and
Atlantis are numbers three and four in a batch of eight that failed
acceptance tests in 1983, then were passed in a subsequent
procedure. The first two were used in March and November last year
to get Discovery into orbit.
   Lenoir said, however, that about 20 such units had failed when
they were first tested, only to pass on a retest and ``we didn't
change procedures in order to pass these.''
   On NASA's other big problem, the out-of-focus $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope, the space agency said that some fuzzy
images may be improved through the same computer process that
cleaned up photos taken by the Voyager spacecraft.
   But, said Ed Weiler, a Hubble project scientist, the pictures
will still be less clear than scientists originally expected.
   Weiler said a team of experts was being selected to determine
how much of the ``fuzz ball'' now being seen by the space telescope
can be turned into crisp pictures through computer techniques.
   He called the improvement of pictures through computers
``something of a black art.'' But he said other experts in the
field are certain they can improve some of Hubble's views.
   ``I'll believe it when I see it,'' Weiler told reporters.
``We'll let the experts play with the images. People in the field
say there is a lot of hope there.''
   Weiler emphasized, however, that the computer-enhancing
technique is only an effort to salvage some good from a
fundamentally flawed telescope.

<HEAD>Ruling Junta General Says Power Will Be Transferred to Civilians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general who heads Burma's military
junta said Tuesday that he will hand over power to a civilian
administration government only after a new constitution is drafted.
   Gen. Saw Maung, the chairman of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council, also said the nation's military rulers are
willing to help draft the constitution.
   In a speech to the council and military commanders, the general
said: ``We are prepared to give suggestions in drafting the
constitution that will be of benefit to the country.
   ``The constitution should not be drafted in a haste just for
speedy transfer of power but it should be drafted to satisfy the
interests of all national races, national unity and rehabilitation
of the country,'' he added.
   Burma's military brutally crushed a pro-democracy uprising in
1988.
   The country's leading pro-democracy party, the National League
for Democracy, scored a massive victory in general elections in
May, but there has not yet been a transfer of power.
   Saw Maung also said though law and order prevails in the
country, there is no political stability yet.
   The general took power in a military coup in 1988.

<HEAD>Angola's Ruling Party Says Multiparty Democracy Possible After War
Ends</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Marxist party pledged Tuesday
to establish a multiparty democracy, but said it could take place
only after the 15-year-old civil war with U.S.-backed rebels ends
and a new constitution is adopted.
   A spokesman for the rebels criticized the declaration as vague.
   In Luanda, the capital, the central committee of the ruling
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola issued its statement
after five days of often heated discussions.
   ``The People's Republic of Angola will evolve toward a
multiparty (political) system, within a framework of a new
constitution to be submitted to a popular referendum,'' the
statement said.
   But the shift away from single-party rule would only come ``once
peace, stability and internal security (exist),'' it added.
   The statement also reaffirmed support for President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos to ``overcome obstacles that continue to block'' a peace
settlement with rebel National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, or UNITA.
   The rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi, have been fighting the
government since Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   In Washington, a rebel spokesman said the declaration ``falls
short of our expectations.''
   ``They are talking about a possibility, after a referendum ...
nobody knows when,'' said Jardo Muekalia, UNITA's Washington
representative.
   ``We had expected them to come out with concrete terms for a
cease-fire and multiparty democracy,'' he said in a telephone
interview.
   Since the collapse of last year's truce, government and rebel
officials have met twice this year for Portuguese-sponsored peace
talks.
   Dos Santos has been under pressure from hard-line party
officials to scrap peace efforts and push further military action.
Some rebel leaders have also opposed the peace talks.
   After the last round of talks in mid-June, Portuguese officials
said the two sides were close to a lasting cease-fire agreement.
   Points of contention are how to monitor a cease-fire and terms
for Angola's political future, diplomats said.
   Savimbi, visiting the African nation of Togo on Tuesday,
demanded a cease-fire before resuming negotiations.
   He said he was optimistic that talks would proceed because ``the
natural allies of our antagonists are no longer in a position to
aid them.''
   Luanda has received massive amounts of Soviet military
equipment, and Moscow has pledged to continue supplies despite its
economic problems.
   The war once pitted South African forces backing UNITA against
some 50,000 Cuban troops in Angola to support the government.
   South African aid to the rebels officially ended with regional
peace accords signed with Angola and Cuba in December 1988, but
UNITA still receives U.S. military assistance.
   Cuba has already sent home more than 33,000 soldiers under the
agreement, but Soviet military aid continues.

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos, acquitted of federal charges that
she helped her husband loot the Philippine treasury, celebrated at
a noisy party with co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi.
   Marcos spokesman Willie Padrone said Mrs. Marcos hasn't decided
to return to Hawaii, where she has lived since she and her late
husband, President Ferdinand Marcos, fled a popular revolt in the
Philippines in 1986.
   Another aide to Mrs. Marcos, Roger Peyuan, said Mrs. Marcos
might stay in New York for a while to do things she wasn't able to
do while she was on trial.
   Khashoggi, whose acquittal freed him of restrictions on his
movements, headed for Palm Beach, Fla. The 54-year-old financier
said he would fly to France, then to his native Saudi Arabia to
visit Islam's holiest shrine at Mecca.
   Mrs. Marcos slept in Tuesday after Monday night's party. Early
Tuesday evening, she left Manhattan for the Hillsborough, N.J.,
home of her friend Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress, Peyuan said.
   Mrs. Duke lent Mrs. Marcos her Manhattan apartment and
reportedly paid legal fees including $5 million for her main
defense attorney, Gerry Spence.
   Peyuan said Mrs. Marcos might stay at Duke's home overnight or
possibly for several days.
   Don Robinson, an attorney who represents Miss Duke, quoted her
as saying: ``When I posted the bail for my friend Imelda a year and
a half ago, I did it because I knew she was innocent. Now that 12
good citizens, after hearing all the evidence, have agreed with me,
I am overjoyed. God Bless America.''
   The jury on Monday rejected the government's allegations that
Mrs. Marcos had helped her husband loot their country's treasury of
$222 million to secretly buy New York buildings and other luxuries.
   It acquitted Khashoggi of charges he faked documents to show
that he, rather than the Marcoses, owned the properties before a
federal court order froze their assets in 1986.
   In post-verdict interviews, jurors made clear they felt the pair
shouldn't have been tried in the United States. One juror, Thomas
O'Rourke, called the case ``totally silly.''
   Ironically, a State Department memo which surfaced after the
acquittal showed that U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, who initiated
the charges against the Marcoses, ``guaranteed'' that the case
would end in conviction.
   Giuliani, the memo said, believed the evidence was so strong
that there was no reason to offer Marcos a plea bargain, because he
would be ``more likely to settle'' after being indicted. The State
Department disagreed.
   ``Marcos should be given a last chance, prior to indictment, to
reach a voluntary plea agreement ... that should enable him to
avoid being sentenced to prison,'' the State Department urged in
the September 1988 memo.
   The memorandum was written by Abraham D. Sofaer, the State
Department's chief legal expert, shortly before a federal grand
jury indicted the Marcoses, Khashoggi and several others. It is
part of the record of the trial.
   It did not mention Mrs. Marcos or Khashoggi, but focused
entirely on Marcos, who the Justice Department said was
``continuing illegal activity'' while living in exile in Hawaii.
   After Marcos' death last September, U.S. officials chose to
continue the case against his widow.
   Giuliani left office in January 1989 and was defeated as the
Republican candidate for mayor of New York last November. He is
with a private law firm, and did not return a phone call to his
office.
   A secretary said he has made it a policy to decline comment on
cases left over from his time as U.S. attorney.
   The office of Giuliani's successor, U.S. Attorney Otto
Obermaier, said it could not estimate the cost of the three-month
trial.
   Speculation that Mrs. Marcos might mount a political challenge
to President Corazon Aquino, who replaced Marcos, was snuffed when
Mrs. Aquino said Mrs. Marcos is a ``security threat'' and would not
be allowed to return.
   Mrs. Aquino said intelligence reports also showed that Mrs.
Marcos ``encouraged and supported those who wanted to grab power''
during a Dec. 1-9 coup attempt in which 113 people were killed and
more than 600 were injured.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said Mrs. Marcos' return was a matter for the government of the
Philippines to determine. But he added that the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service's June 16, 1989, ``departure control
order'' prohibiting Mrs. Marcos from leaving the country remained
in effect.
   He said the ban was based on the potential for ``destabilizing
activity'' should she return to Manila as well as the legal
problems here.

   Police uncovered an international network
of art smugglers and recovered more than 1,500 ancient vases,
coins, statuettes and other items worth millions of dollars, news
reports said Tuesday.
   The antiquities, many in near-perfect condition, had disappeared
from archeological digs in Tuscany and southern Italy, the state
RAI television network reported.
   In an investigation that started in November, police traced a
network of thieves who were sending the ancient artworks to
Switzerland, where several companies restored them and issued false
documents on their authenticity and value, the Italian news service
ANSA reported.
   Some of the items, most of which dated from the ancient Etruscan
civilization of central Italy, were sent back to Florence and sold
to private buyers, ANSA said. Other items were sold directly to
museums throughout the world, it said.
   Forty Italians, Swiss and West Germans have been accused of
criminal association, receiving stolen goods and violation of the
law on cultural patrimony, ANSA reported.
   The 1,500 objects were recovered in house searches throughout
Italy and the confiscation of a train shipment in Florence,
according to the agency.

   Rioting broke out in the Albanian
capital of Tirana, and diplomats said Tuesday that hundreds of
people stormed foreign embassies there trying to flee Europe's last
bastion of hard-line communism.
   Italy's Foreign Ministry, in a statement in Rome, said Albanian
security forces used firearms to try to turn back the refugees. A
Greek government communique reported shooting and unconfirmed
accounts of ``victims among the population.''
   The Albanian government confirmed the rioting and acknowledged
people were wounded at one embassy.
   A statement by the official ATA news agency said 300 to 400
people, including ``vagabonds, former prisoners ... as well as some
deceived adolescents,'' tried to storm the unspecified embassy
Monday night.
   The statement, telexed to The Associated Press in Vienna, said
the crowd threw stones and bricks at police, blocked traffic and
broke shop windows. It said security forces restored order and
detained people. It said some people were ``slightly wounded.''
   Diplomats said about 200 Albanians sought refuge in at least a
dozen embassies since late last week. The greatest concentration,
86, appeared to be in the West German compound.
   Hanns Schumacher, deputy West German Foreign Ministry spokesman,
said in Bonn the refugees' motives were not completely clear, but
he assumed ``this is the outbreak of dissatisfaction with the
existing political realities in Albania.''
   Security forces patrolled Tirana in strength on Tuesday, and 150
officers guarded the West German and Turkish embassies, the Austria
Press Agency said.
   It quoted Western diplomats as saying anti-government
demonstrations had hit Tirana in the last few days.
   Austria Press Agency reporter Wilfried Seywald reported from
Tirana that authorities canceled all Tuesday appointments. The mood
was reported as somber, with security forces everywhere.
   Turkish Ambassador Teoman Surenkok said 26 of the 32 Albanians
who fled to his embassy left after the Albanian government allowed
them to leave the country, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
   The Czechoslovak news agency CTK said representatives of the
Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry began talks with Albanian authorities
to try to resolve their embassy occupation.
   One Western diplomat in Tirana said the surge of refugees
started last week when 25 Albanians entered the Polish Embassy.
   A host country cannot legally violate embassy premises.
   The developments were reminiscent of events last year, when East
Germans crowded Western embassies in Eastern Europe and touched off
the popular revolution in their country.
   Albania has vigorously resisted the pro-democracy movements that
have radically altered other Eastern European nations. The Albanian
government has made only modest reforms in that country of 3.2
million.
   Greece's government released a statement Tuesday saying,
``According to other reports which have been impossible to confirm
up to now, shots were heard last night and it is rumored that there
were victims among the population.''
   The Albanian news agency said that ``with the immediate
interference of the forces of order and the working people of the
capital, the persons who violated order and tranquility dispersed.
There were slightly wounded on both parties. The people kept a
number of them for the necessary investigations.''
   The agency called Monday night's disturbance ``an alarming
situation'' aimed at impairing ``the good relations existing with
the friendly states represented in Tirana, and to distort the image
of Albania in the world.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said 86 refugees were in the West German Embassy as of
Tuesday night.
   Guards fired on one group of four who fled into the compound
Sunday night, wounding one man in the leg, said Schumacher.
Seventy-nine people fled to the embassy Monday night and early
Tuesday, West German diplomats said.
   One group crashed their truck into the German compound's walls,
others fled in through that hole and the final group crashed their
truck into the Greek compound next door as Albanian guards fired on
them, West German diplomats said. In the confusion, some Albanians
fled into the Greek compound and some into the West German Embassy,
said a ministry spokesman.
   ``I heard more than 50 shots when they were trying to get into
the West German Embassy,'' the Western diplomat in Tirana said.
   Three more refugees gained entry into the West German Embassy
later Tuesday, the German spokesman said.
   Asylum seekers also used a truck to break into the Italian
Embassy, said the Western diplomat. An Italian Foreign Ministry
spokesman said about 20 refugees were seeking asylum there.
   West Germany summoned the Albanian ambassador to the Foreign
Ministry to protest ``the brutal behavior'' of Albanian authorities.
   Italy made a similar protest.
   Hungary's MTI news agency said four Albanians were in Hungary's
embassy.
   Refugees were also reportedly holed up at embassies of France,
Algeria, Bulgaria, China and Egypt.

   A Soviet helicopter pilot hailed as a hero for
trying to douse the 1986 fire at the Chernobyl nuclear plant
despite intense radiation died at age 53 after developing
radiation-related leukemia.
   Anatoly Grishchenko died late Monday at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center. The final cause of death was listed as
heart failure brought on by a lung infection.
   Doctors said Tuesday that Grishchenko may have been doomed by
delays in getting him treatment. Still, Grishchenko's Soviet
physician said the treatment he received at the center was the best
anywhere, and said she could not fault it.
   ``I'll try to tell my chief and all the Soviet people and all
the Soviet physicians that patient Grishchenko had the best
treatment he could have here at this center,'' Dr. Eugenia Margulis
told a news conference Tuesday.
   ``Everybody was taking care of him. Not only the physicians and
the nurses and the staff, but all the people from Seattle.''
   She said Grishchenko, the only Chernobyl victim to be treated in
the United States, received more than 100 cards and letters daily
from around the country.
   Seattle Mayor Norm Rice ordered flags on city buildings to fly
at half-staff Tuesday in Grishchenko's honor.
   In April 1986, Grishchenko repeatedly flew his helicopter
through the intensely radioactive gases above the smoldering
Chernobyl plant, dumping sand and cement to entomb the crippled
reactor after it exploded.
   He was among a handful of participants designated heroes of the
Soviet Union, that country's highest honor. When Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev visited America in June for summit talks with
President Bush, he sent a top aide to give Grishchenko a
handwritten note praising his bravery.
   After the disaster, Grishchenko suffered acute radiation
sickness. He was found to have leukemia last year. He was flown to
Seattle April 11, and a bone- marrow transplant was performed later
that month.
   Doctors thought his chances of recovery good, and Hutchinson
Associate Director John Hansen said he was out of bed doing
exercises after the transplant.
   But a lung infection flared up, and Grishchenko underwent
surgery June 12. His condition worsened, and on June 15 he was
placed on a respirator.
   Hutchinson Dr. Finn Petersen, who assisted in the transplant,
said a combination of Soviet red tape and difficulty finding a
marrow donor contributed to the infection, which he said developed
when Grishchenko got pneumonia in January and persisted until it
cut off oxygen to his bloodstream.
   ``He probably would not have developed this infection if we
didn't have the wait,'' Petersen said.
   ``We should have done the transplant last fall,'' Hansen added.
   Grishchenko's initial response to treatment showed promise for
others, said Dr. Patrick Beatty, director of the center's Unrelated
Transplant Program.
   ``Despite his heavy radiation exposure in the past ... he
actually did extremely well in the transplant,'' Beatty said.
   Margulis did not know how many people in the Soviet Union suffer
from similar conditions, and neither she nor Hansen could say if
others are trying to get treatment at American facilities.
   Margulis said a new medical center is planned for Gomel, about
300 miles southwest of Moscow, near Chernobyl.
   ``It is better to build a new center in the Soviet Union than to
send them here,'' which is ``very expensive to our government,''
she said.
   Grishchenko's treatment is estimated to have cost about $180,000.
   Margulis said she learned a lot about treating radiation cancer,
but was frustrated at having to wait to apply that knowledge at
home until the Gomel center is built.
   Margulis will accompany Grishchenko's body back to Moscow with
his widow, Galina.
   ``Mrs. Grishchenko is a very brave, strong, courageous woman and
she is handling this very well,'' Hansen said.

   A frantic stampede that killed more
than 1,400 Moslem pilgrims inside a pedestrian tunnel was prompted
by the tumbling of seven people from a bridge overhead, the
interior minister said Tuesday.
   Prince Nayef put the death toll at 1,426, making it the worst
pilgrimage tragedy in recent history. There were no further details
immediately available on the pilgrims who fell from the bridge.
   Reporters were barred from the General Hospital at Mina, the
tent city connected by the tunnel to Mecca. Officials said the
government had ordered that journalists not be allowed to interview
or photograph victims.
   The tragedy shattered what had been a peaceful observance of the
annual pilgrimage, or Hajj, for the first time in four years. In
previous years, the celebration was marred by terrorist attacks and
riots.
   The Mo'essem pedestrian tunnel, which is under part of a
mountain, is 500 yards long and 20 yards wide. It was built under a
$15-billion development project launched by the government at holy
sites two years ago.
   The air-conditioned tunnel was packed ``multiple times beyond
its capacity, with some 50,000 people inside,'' Prince Nayef said.
The temperature outside soared to 112 degrees.
   ``The fall of the seven (from the bridge) spread terror, and the
tremendous throngs of the pilgrims caused them all to tumble onto
each other,'' he said on state television.
   ``Old people first began falling under the feet in panic and
terror,'' an aide to Prince Nayef said. ``No one could go back or
forth ... the pilgrims were falling on each other, the bodies
piling on each other ... there was a mad rush and screaming.''
   Witnesses said the panic began after power inside the tunnel was
suddenly cut off. Most victims died of suffocation or were trampled
in the ensuing stampede.
   A Sudanese survivor told state TV: ``We were stuck inside unable
to move back or forth. Rescue men were throwing sacks of ice-cold
water which we grabbed to overcome the heat and thirst ... there
was no ventilation and the number of hajjis (pilgrims) in the
tunnel was growing bigger by the second.''
   Prince Nayef, who is the Saudi monarch's brother, said a number
of pilgrims fainted at were treated on the spot, but he did not say
how many people were injured. He also did not give the
nationalities of the victims.
   Asian and Middle Eastern diplomats told The Associated Press on
Monday night that there were 1,400 victims, including Egyptians,
Indians, Pakistanis, Indonesians, Malaysians, Turks and Saudis.
   Islam prescribes quick burial of the dead, but in case of
accidents of great magnitude, bodies are allowed to stay in morgues
until governments or relatives decide whether they should be flown
home or buried in the holy cities.
   Most families were expected to decide to bury their next of kin
in Mecca, sources said.
   In Malaysia, the daughter of one victim was quoted as saying her
father had mentioned before going to Mecca ``how wonderful it would
be if he were to die among holy people in the sacred city.''
   Roslina Mat Taib told the national news agency Bernama her
family was grateful her father's wish had come true, especially
because there would be thousands of pilgrims to pray for him and
the others who died.
   King Fahd said Monday that the incident ``was God's will, which
is above everything.
   ``It was fate. Had they not died there, they would have died
elsewhere and at the same predestined moment,'' he said.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush sent condolences to the
pilgrims' families.
   Outside the Mina hospital Tuesday, pilgrims waited for word on
missing relatives and friends.
   Four Egyptian men said they were looking for a missing friend.
One said the group had been a few yards from the tunnel when the
stampede occurred. Their friend was two yards ahead of them and had
entered the tunnel.
   ``He did not come back,'' the pilgrim said. He refused to give
his name.
   About 2 million Moslems gathered in Mecca for this year's
pilgrimage, which climaxed Monday with Eid Al-Adha, or the Feast of
Sacrifice. The three-day holiday commemorates the prophet Abraham's
offering of his son as sacrifice to God.
   Pilgrims milled through Mecca on Tuesday, carrying on with
religious rituals and almost oblivious to the tunnel accident.
   They chanted: ``Allahu Akbar Kabira, Al-Hamdulillah Katheera,''
Arabic for ``God is most great, many thanks be to God.''
   Tuesday's rituals included the symbolic stoning of the devil at
Mina. They also circled the Kaaba, in the Grand Mosque, which is
Islam's holiest shrine.
   Many pilgrims also headed for Medina, the second-holiest city,
to visit the prophet Mohammed's tomb.
   Mecca is where the 7th century prophet Mohammed, founder of
Islam, was born.
   In 1986, security officials found large quantities of explosives
in Mecca, indicating some kind of sabotage was planned.
   The following year, the city was shaken by its worst bout of
violence ever. Saudi riot police clashed with pilgrims, who defied
a government ban on political rallies during the religious event.
More than 400 people, most of the Iranians, were killed.
   Last year, one pilgrim was killed and 16 wounded when two bombs
exploded in the holy city. Sixteen people, tried and convicted of
the attacks, later were beheaded.

   NATO plans to signal its peaceful
intentions toward their former adversaries in Eastern Europe at
this week's summit but is at odds over issuing a non-aggression
declaration, officials said Tuesday.
   ``The idea of sending some kind of sign to the East that we
really mean it when we say we're non-aggressive ... has a good deal
of support,'' said a senior official at NATO, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But he said there was ``good deal of debate'' about how it
should be done.
   ``This is completely up in the air,'' said another diplomat, who
also demanded anonymity.
   One official said it was among the most controversial issues
leading up to the Thursday-Friday summit of President Bush and
other NATO leaders in London. The leaders are expected to kick off
a formal review of the alliance to give it a more political, less
military tone. They want to make the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization appear less threatening to the Soviet Union.
   In doing so, the allies hope Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will drop his objections to full and immediate membership
for a united Germany in NATO.
   West Germany belongs to NATO. East Germany is a member of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. More than 380,000 Red Army soldiers are
stationed in East Germany.
   NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner says the summit will
offer ``a very clear message about the peaceful intentions of our
member nations ... and also about the non-aggressive character of
our alliance.''
   The Soviets last month floated a vague proposal for some kind of
a political accord between the two alliances, which has led to the
current controversy over the shape of a non-aggression declaration.
   A statement could be arranged between NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
although the Western allies appear hesitant to do anything that
might prop up the collapsing Eastern military alliance.
   As an alternative, a ``declaration of good intentions'' could be
worked out among the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations, a NATO
diplomat said.
   Or the declaration could be as simple as a unilateral statement
by NATO.
   The United States does not feel it necessary to draw up a
formal, separate document as has been suggested by West Germany and
others, officials said.
   An official said Washington favors ``as little as possible''
because NATO has asserted the non-threatening nature of the
alliance before.

   A military transport plane carrying 100
soldiers veered off a runway and crashed Tuesday at an airport near
the Venezuelan border, killing a pilot and injuring 20 soldiers,
civil aviation officials said.
   The Hercules C-130 plane had left Medellin and was landing at
the airport of Ocana when the accident occurred, the officials said.
   The crash damaged a motor and a wing of the plane, the civil
aviation office said.
   Officials said they did not know the cause of the accident.
   Hundreds of police and soldiers have been assigned to Medellin,
a cocaine trafficking center that has often been the battleground
in the government's war on drugs, to maintain order.

   The huge Santa Barbara brush fire that burned
hundreds of homes was brought under control Tuesday as scores of
fire victims across Southern California began the formidable job of
recovery.
   The declaration was issued at 6 a.m., 5{ days after the blaze
was set by an arsonist in San Marcos Pass and blew down the
foothills of the coastal mountains through hundreds of homes on the
outskirts of Santa Barbara.
   A small crew of firefighters backed by a helicopter and two
engines watched for smoldering hotspots, but the blaze was
considered controlled because no flames showed within 300 feet of
fire lines cut through the brush.
   But while victory over the 4,500-acre fire took less than a
week, people burned out of more than 450 dwellings were only
beginning a long process of rebuilding and emotional recovery.
   It was the same story in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale,
where 66 hillside homes were damaged or destroyed in a arson blaze
June 27, and in the aftermath of a 6,640-acre blaze that straddled
the Orange-San Bernardino county line and destroyed 14 homes last
week. Both fires were caused by arson, officials said.
   In Santa Barbara and Glendale, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and state Office of Emergency Services opened centers to
take applications for low-interest loans and grants.
   Fires also continued to burn in Colorado and Texas.
   In California, organizations like the Red Cross and Salvation
Army continued supplying victims with immediate essentials,
including clothing, medicine, and in some cases psychological aid.
   ``The stress and emotional trauma is paramount right now. We
have many severely traumatized people,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman
Elizabeth Quirk in Santa Barbara.
   More than 340 families were registered with the Red Cross in
Santa Barbara and the number was expected to top 600. Six shelters
that housed more than 1,000 people during the fire were closed, and
efforts focused on finding regular housing.
   Red Cross, which already has committed $200,000 in direct
services to victims, will provide the first month's rent and
security deposit.
   The question will be whether there is enough housing in the
area, Ms. Quirk said.
   On the rebuilding front, Santa Barbara County was in its second
day of issuing demolition permits. On Monday, 280 people began the
permit process, said spokeswoman Jayne Brechwald.
   Residents also will need permits for temporary housing,
electrical poles and similar fixtures that must be in place before
construction can start. Permit fees were waived for the time being.
   A private relief center was established at the Goleta Youth
Sports Center to help people reach contractors, architects, and
real-estate and insurance agents.
   Despite the breadth of help coming to the region, experts
predicted a very lengthy recovery.
   ``We'll probably still be taking care of fire victims for at
least a year,'' Ms. Quirk said.
   Red Cross had on hand 650 local volunteers and was ready to
supply victims with some furnishings, occupational supplies like
uniforms and tools, and personal items like eyeglasses,
prescription medicines and dentures.
   Four roving food trucks have served 4,000 meals in the fire area
since the blaze began.
   Help has come from across North America. A Robinson's department
store gave Red Cross $50,000 for direct dispersal to victims.

<HEAD>Convicted Killer of Wife, Three Children Gets New Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was convicted six years ago
of hacking and bludgeoning his wife and three children to death was
granted a new trial Tuesday by the Illinois Supreme Court.
   The court, reversing a decision it made in 1988, ruled that
David Hendricks' 1984 trial was tainted by prosecutors' use of
testimony about his alleged extramarital sexual interests.
   At the trial, female models employed by Hendricks in his
back-brace business testified that he fondled or kissed them while
they were partially nude.
   Prosecutors said the testimony backed their theory that
Hendricks killed his family with an ax and butcher knife to escape
a ``sexually frustrating'' marriage. But the Supreme Court ruled
the testimony was irrelevant.
   The court also said prosecutors shouldn't have been allowed to
present testimony on the beliefs of the fundamentalist Christian
sect to which Hendricks belongs. Prosecutors contended Hendricks
feared he would be ostracized by the group if he tried to divorce
his wife.
   Hendricks, 35, is serving four consecutive life prison sentences
at the maximum-security Menard Correctional Center for the killings
of his wife, Susan, 30, daughters Rebekah, 9, and Grace, 7, and son
Benjamin, 5, in their Bloomington home in November 1983.
   He has insisted that he was out of town at the time of the
killings and could not have committed them.
   Although the Supreme Court upheld his conviction in December
1988, it took the unusual step last year of agreeing to reconsider
the case. The court offered no explanation for granting the second
hearing.
   The prosecutor who would be responsible for a second trial,
McLean County State's Attorney Charles Reynard, declined to comment
immediately. He said he would make a statement Thursday after
reviewing the Supreme Court's decision.
   But the man who prosecuted Hendricks, former State's Attorney
Ronald Dozier, said last year that Hendricks might go free if a new
trial were ordered because of the likely difficulty of persuading
the models to repeat their testimony. Dozier, now a circuit judge,
would not comment Tuesday.
   Hendricks' attorney, Richard McLeese, said he was ``very, very
pleased'' by the court's decision, but declined to comment on the
next probable step in the case.
   Hendricks remarried while in prison, and has been supported
throughout his appeals by family members, including Nadine Palmer,
the mother of his slain wife.
   ``Now I hope they can turn their attention to whoever did it and
prosecute them,'' Mrs. Palmer said in a telephone interview after
the ruling.
   Hendricks, described by friends as a mild-mannered, devoted
family man, was convicted after one of the most publicized trials
in recent Illinois history.
   Prosecutors had no physical evidence or witnesses against him,
and he said he was out of town on a business trip at the time of
the killings. The prosecution case was based on his alleged sexual
motives and on evidence indicating the children died before the
time Hendricks said he left the house.
   After Hendricks was convicted, Circuit Judge Richard Baner
denied the state's request to impose a death sentence, saying he
did not personally believe Hendricks had been proved guilty beyond
a reasonable doubt.
   Last August, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Hendricks
asserted that his former brother-in-law, Jon Lewis, committed the
crimes. Lewis denied it. Prosecutors said Lewis was ruled out as a
suspect because he passed a lie-detector test, which Hendricks
refused.

   A man who claims he won a $1,304 bet at the
dog track has gone to court five times trying to collect on a dog
that crossed the finish line tail-first and upside down.
   ``I'm like David fighting Goliath. I'm gonna win this thing,''
said Alfred Alchediak, 70, whose lawsuit against Tampa Greyhound
Track, its officials and the state parimutuel board was rejected by
a judge Friday for a fifth time.
   In 1988, Alchediak bet $140 on a Tampa Greyhound Track trifecta,
picking K's Broadway to finish first, Ari Cannon second, and
Oshkosh Zest to show. That's how they crossed the finish line.
   Unfortunately, Oshkosh Zest bumped Ari Cannon from behind,
nosedived into the track, flipped, and flew across the finish line
upside down and backward _ but ahead of the fourth dog.
   Track judges ruled Oshkosh Zest ineligible because of the fall.
Alchediak cites the racing rules, which say judges ``shall consider
only the relative position of the respective noses of such
greyhounds.''
   Alchediak says he'll appeal the latest decision. Meanwhile, he's
been back to the track only once since since the night Oshkosh Zest
was disqualified. And he says he has a new hobby: garage-sale
shopping.

   After more than 12 years, Soviet-born comic
Yakov Smirnoff returned as a U.S. citizen on a nostalgic visit to
his homeland.
   What a country.
   ``I can live another 12 years without going back,'' Smirnoff
said. ``It's a very depressed country,'' Smirnoff said. ``People
are in a survival mode. There are still long lines for food,
although the lines are even longer now.
   ``And if there are no lines, it's because there is no food. The
problems are still overwhelming.''
   Smirnoff, 39, who emigrated to the United States with his
parents in 1977, returned to the Soviet Union in April to tape a TV
special. It was part of a world tour that began in Moscow and ends
Thanksgiving day in Moscow, Idaho.
   He joked to Soviet audiences about the demise of the Berlin
Wall, but admits he was apprehensive: ``What if they were just
remodeling?''
   An unapologetic salesman for the United States, Smirnoff has
headlined in Las Vegas and performed at the White House for
Presidents Reagan and Bush. That's not bad for a comic who started
in $8 gigs in Odessa, his hometown.
   ``I'm in love with America. It's my home, and I feel very much
at home.''
   Smirnoff was trained to be a teacher. Comedy, his first love,
was hardly a promising career in the Soviet Union, but by his
mid-20s he was earning $200 a month, more than doctors or lawyers.
   But his family had no car, no phone, and lived in a communal
apartment building. He began performing on cruise ships on the
Black Sea, where he met his first Americans.
   ``They had a special spark in their eyes that nobody else had,
even Western Europeans,'' Smirnoff recalled in an interview in Las
Vegas last week. ``I liked that. Suddenly all of those stories they
were telling us, that Americans were bad, they were warmongers who
would kill their mothers for money, didn't make sense.''
   Smirnoff and his parents lived a year in a two-room,
$180-a-month apartment in New York City.
   Learning to speak English was one of his toughest challenges.
``I locked myself in a room for three months with a TV set,
determined I'd learn the language. Then I discovered I'd been
watching a Spanish station.''
   He worked as a bartender in the Catskills, then headed for Los
Angeles and a job as doorman and part-time performer at Mitzi
Shore's Comedy Store.
   He became a U.S. citizen on July 4, 1986, at a special Statue of
Liberty ceremony.
   He's perplexed over issues like burning the American flag. ``The
issue doesn't come up very often in Russia,'' he said. ``It's not
something you debate.''
   He likens the fate of communism to the fate of the Berlin Wall.
   ``They didn't go in and just bulldoze the wall; they're chipping
away at it bit by bit,'' he said. ``That's what's happening to
communism. They're chipping away at it, bit by bit.''

   Nelson Mandela said Tuesday night it is very
likely the armed struggle of the African National Congress in South
Africa will be over by the end of this year.
   Speaking on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Newsnight''
television program, the ANC leader said he had discussed the issue
with South Africa's president, F.W. de Klerk.
   ``We have agreed on the removal of the obstacles to
negotiations, and I have no doubt that in our second meeting we
will achieve this,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela said a cease-fire in the armed struggle was ``very
likely'' to occur by the year's end.
   De Klerk and Western leaders, including President Bush and
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, have urged the ANC to
give up violence. The ANC's armed campaign has been largely dormant
in the past year, but ANC leaders said they could not end it until
police and troops quit firing on unarmed black protesters.
   Mandela and other black leaders plan to meet with South African
officials on his return from a 14-nation world tour.
   Earlier Tuesday, Mandela struggled to untangle himself from the
Northern Ireland conflict and focus attention on Britain's
opposition to sanctions against South Africa.
   He denied having called on Britain to negotiate with the Irish
Republican Army, insisting he was just expressing his belief that
all conflicts should be settled peacefully. British officials have
refused to hold talks with the IRA, saying it is a terrorist group.
   Mandela's replies to questions on the IRA at a Dublin news
conference on Monday made front-page headlines and continued to dog
him at meetings Tuesday with members of Parliament and Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   Hurd said Mandela, the deputy president of the ANC, ``cleared up
the position as far as he was concerned.''
   ``I expressed the strong feelings of everyone here, that the IRA
are rejects of the political system,'' he said. ``Having failed to
persuade people in free elections they turn to murder and
destruction.''
   Britain is promoting negotiations between the main Protestant
and Catholic parties of Northern Ireland, and has suggested the IRA
can be drawn in if it disavows violence.
   The IRA has waged a campaign of bombings and shootings in an
effort to force British troops out of Northern Ireland. The IRA
wants to unite Northern Ireland with the Irish Republic and set up
a socialist state.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who narrowly escaped an IRA bomb in 1984, was
expected to reiterate Britain's position when she meets Mandela on
Wednesday.
   Even before the IRA issue arose, Britain was already expected to
be the most difficult stop on Mandela's world tour.
   Mrs. Thatcher openly opposes sanctions against South Africa, and
wants those imposed by the European Community relaxed as a reward
for President F.W. de Klerk's reform program. Mandela insists the
ANC alone should decide when sanctions can be lifted.
   But their talks signify the about-face in British policy since
1987, when Mrs. Thatcher branded the ANC ``a typical terrorist
organization'' and said she wouldn't talk to it.
   Mandela said ``the possibility is always there'' that his talks
with Mrs. Thatcher might narrow their differences.
   Mandela, 71, arrived from Dublin, the Irish capital, nursing a
severe cold, and canceled some of the engagements on his two-day
London schedule.
   Meeting 200 members of Parliament assembled by the all-party
Southern Africa Committee, Mandela insisted he was not trying to
interfere in the Northern Ireland conflict.
   ``I expressed no opinion whatsoever on the actual conflict
between the IRA and the British government,'' Mandela insisted.
   ``What I said was to point out that our approach as the ANC is
that all conflicts, wherever in the world they are from, should be
settled peacefully,'' he said.
   In Dublin, when asked about the IRA, Mandela replied: ``What we
would like to see is that the British government and the IRA should
adopt precisely the line that we have taken in regard to our own
internal situation.
   ``There is nothing better than opponents sitting down to resolve
their problems in a peaceful manner.''
   The controversy was one of the few jarring notes on Mandela's
otherwise triumphant trip to urge continued international pressure
to end apartheid in South Africa.
   Mandela was freed from prison in February. He had been jailed
since 1962 and was serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government.

<HEAD>Israeli Officer Says Release of Shiite Inmates Possible</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 7 grafs, UPDATING with Shiite leader kidnap comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Israeli army officer was quoted
Tuesday as saying that some of the 300 inmates held in southern
Lebanon may be freed soon, a key demand of Shiite Moslem factions
holding Western hostages.
   Voice of the South, a radio station controlled by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, said the remark was made
by Brig. Gen. Zeev Zakharin. It identified him as an officer in
Israel's North Front command.
   A military source in Tel Aviv identified Zakharin as chief
liaison to Lebanon.
   The source, who requested anonymity, said what is under
consideration is a ``traditional'' release of inmates on the
occasion of Islam's holiday of Eid Al-Adha. The source would give
no other details.
   The radio said Zakharin toured Israel's self-designated
``security zone'' with Maj. Gen. Antoine Lahd, a retired Lebanese
army officer who heads the 3,000-strong South Lebanese Army.
   The broadcast added that Zakharin met on his tour with
``Lebanese notables.''
   He told them Israel would soon consider the issue of the inmates
at the Khiyam prison, located in the security zone, and ``possibly
release some of them,'' the broadcast said. It gave no other
details.
   Israeli leaders have previously insisted that any deal involving
the release of the prisoners at Khiyam must include the release of
three Israeli servicemen captured by Shiite groups in south Lebanon.
   Pro-Iranian fundamentalists holding most of the 16 Western
hostages have, for their part, demanded the Khiyam prisoners be
released before any of the Western hostages are let go.
   The hostages include six Americans. The longest-held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The Khiyam inmates are being held on suspicion of supporting
guerrillas seeking to oust the Israelis from Lebanon. They were
captured in sweeps after Israel carved out the 440-square-mile
security zone in 1985. Israel said it took the land to guard
against cross-border guerrilla raids.
   The strip is policed jointly by the SLA and 1,000 Israeli troops.
   Iranian officials demanded a ``goodwill gesture'' from the
United States after mediating the release in April of two American
hostages, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed.
   Tehran said it would work for the release of others if the
United States and Western governments pressured Israel to free the
Khiyam inmates.
   In Hamburg, West Germany, Stern magazine on Tuesday quoted
Lebanese Shiite leader Hussein Musawi as saying the time was not
right to free any of the six Americans, but that West German
hostages Heinrich Struebig and Thomas Kemptner could be released at
once if two Shiites imprisoned in West Germany are freed.
   Musawi's Islamic Amal organization is a pro-Syrian group within
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God. Hezbollah is
believed to be the umbrella for extremist groups holding most of
the missing Westerners.
   Stern quoted Musawi as saying Struebig and Kemptner, missing
since May 16, 1989, are being held by members of the Hamadi family
in Beirut.
   Mohammed Ali Hamadi is serving a life sentence for hijacking a
TWA airliner in June 1985 and killing a U.S. sailor on the plane.
   His older brother, Abbas, is serving 13 years for kidnapping two
West Germans in January 1987 to gain Mohammed's release.
   ``Kidnapping is our means to practice retaliation against the
aggression of the Israelis and the Americans,'' Stern quoted Musawi
as saying.
   The magazine also quoted him as saying terrorist attacks and
kidnappings carried out against Israel and Western countries were
intended to defend Palestinian territory.

<HEAD>Iliescu Backs Government Reform Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ion Iliescu declared his
support Tuesday for the government's radical economic reform
program, but said introducing a market economy will pose a
difficult challenge.
   Iliescu made his remarks during a ceremony at which he
officially confirmed the appointments of Prime Minister Petre
Roman's new 23-member Cabinet.
   He made his first public statement in support of the economic
reform program that Roman outlined to Parliament last week. At the
time, Parliament declared its backing for the program and Roman's
Cabinet nominees.
   Iliescu's National Salvation Front, which has dominated the
government since the December revolution that toppled Communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, handily won the May 20 elections on a
platform that promised a slower pace of change that would avoid
economic upheaval.
   In his speech to Parliament last week, Roman said that only
radical reforms aimed at transforming the centrally planned
socialist system to a market economy could overcome the country's
economicy crisis. While avoiding specifics, Roman pledged to
present an initial package of reforms to Parliament within six
months.
   Iliescu told the new ministers that ``all social groups and
political forces cannot but adhere to such a program.''
   But he warned that the ``transition from a super-centralized
structure ... toward a market economy based on natural forces''
will be a difficult task.
   ``To govern under the present conditions of our country and
remove it from the profound economic and spiritual crisis will not
be easy,'' Iliescu said.
   Unlike Roman, Iliescu stressed in his speech that the reforms
must be accompanied by ``a wide-ranging social protection program.''
   The ceremony, which was attended by Romanian journalists but
closed to the foreign press, was held at Iliescu's new headquarters
at Cotroceni Palace, the former headquarters of the scout movement.
   Last week, Roman blamed the foreign press for distorting the
events of June 13-15, when security forces broke up a 53-day
opposition demonstration that had blocked Bucharest's main downtown
square.
   Roman said Romania's image had been ``inadmissibly damaged'' by
the reporting on the disturbances in the capital that left six
people dead.
   The foreign ministry on Tuesday issued a protest to Hungary for
its official criticism of the violence.
   The ministry said the Hungarians were only considering the
events of June 14-15 when thousands of miners responded to a
government appeal for support and beat up students and other
government opponents in Bucharest.
   It said the Hungarians were ``knowingly forgetting'' the events
of June 13 when demonstrators attacked several government buildings
after security forces broke up the demonstration on University
Square.
   The United States reacted to the government's role in the
violence by suspending all non-humanitarian aid to Romania.
   On Tuesday, Iliescu sent President Bush a message for the Fourth
of July expressing the hope that ``relations between the two
countries develop along new lines in a spirit of faith and mutual
respect.''
   In Bucharest, various student groups concluded a two-day
congress with an appeal to the government to release jailed student
leader Marian Munteanu.
   Munteanu, the president of the Bucharest University Student
League, was an organizer of anti-government demonstrations. He was
among those beaten by miners and was arrested from his hospital bed.
   In their appeal, the students said Munteanu ``had become a
symbol of the non-violence of the student movement for democracy
and liberty.''

   A jury acquitted a young white man Tuesday of
intentionally murdering a black teen-ager in a racial attack in
Bensonhurst. But the jury failed to resolve a second murder count
and a riot charge against him.
   The jury, in its ninth day of deliberations, convicted John
Vento of two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of
menacing for his role in the attack that inflamed racial passions
in New York City.
   Two other young whites have been convicted in the assault on
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, who was shot to death Aug. 23. Hawkins
had come to the predominantly white Brooklyn neighborhood to buy a
used car.
   Vento, who reneged on an immunity deal to testify against his
co-defendants, faces a September retrial on the unresolved charges,
including a charge of murder by depraved indifference, prosecutors
said.
   He could be sentenced to a year and four months to four years on
the unlawful imprisonment counts and 90 days on each menacing
count. The sentencing will be Aug. 14.
   The 21-year-old sat silently, flashing an occasional tight
smile, as the verdicts were read. He was acquitted of intentional
murder, a weapons possession charge, one count of unlawful
imprisonment and five counts of discrimination.
   ``There's a difference between racism, which is not illegal, and
discrimination, which is,'' said juror Lee Levin.
   Levin, one of the two holdouts for a murder conviction, said
that the disagreement on that count was over Vento's mental
culpability.
   Juror Irwin Ziegler said the deliberations were ``not very nice.
... It was very tense, very emotional, a lot of yelling and
screaming.''
   Vento was the trial defendant to be tried in the attack. Five
other Brooklyn youths face trial in the case.
   Joseph Fama, 19 _ identified by Vento as the triggerman _ was
convicted of murder in the first trial and sentenced to 32 and
two-thirds years to life. Keith Mondello, 19, received five and
one-third to 16 years for his convictions on lesser charges.
   Last Friday, the mothers of Vento and Hawkins had an emotional
meeting at the courthouse in which Maria Vento offered condolences
to Diane Hawkins, New York Newsday reported Tuesday.
   The families would not discuss with reporters details of the
private meeting. But Hawkins' father, Moses Stewart, said it was
``the beginning of the healing process'' between blacks and whites
in New York.
   ``That doesn't take any guilt away from their son, but we have a
mother who understands what it's like to have a son who's been
murdered,'' Stewart said, gesturing toward the Vento family. ``We
have a mother who knows what it's like to have a son on trial for
murder,'' he added, motioning toward Diane Hawkins.
   Vento fled upstate the day after Hawkins' murder, but later
called prosecutors to confess. He agreed to cooperate and testify
against his friends in exchange for immunity.
   At an appearance before a grand jury in September, Vento
provided a graphic account of the attack. He said he watched from
just several feet away as Fama pulled an automatic pistol and fired
into Hawkins' chest.
   But he later fled the city again, just two months before the
scheduled start of the first Bensonhurst trial. He surrendered to
FBI agents in Dayton, Ohio, in March, but announced he would no
longer cooperate.
   He was indicted a week later.

<HEAD>Lawyers Say Hundreds Exposed to Detergent May Have Been Harmed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for a woman who will get $3.75
million from a chemical company after claiming their detergent
caused her leukemia say the detergent may also have harmed hundreds
of others.
   Fawna Wright, 23, of Mound City, Ill., reached the settlement
with BASF Wyandotte Corp., of Michigan, on Monday, the day a civil
trial was to start.
   Wright's 1985 lawsuit claimed her illness was linked to exposure
to toxic chemicals in Loxene, a detergent once produced by BASF and
used to launder diapers and bed linens at Booth Memorial Hospital
here, where she was born in 1967.
   ``Wyandotte continued to manufacture Loxene despite repeated
warnings of its potential danger and continued to market it to
hospitals after it had twice promised the USDA that it would not,''
one of Wright's lawyers, Robert Bogard, said Monday.
   ``Therefore, we now have hundreds of persons exposed at Booth or
other hospitals using Loxene during the 1960s who may be suffering
from problems ranging from learning disabilities to cancer, and
they don't even suspect that their illnesses are linked to the
diapers they wore in the hospital.''
   Wright, whose leukemia is in remission and who plans to attend
nursing school in the fall, said she hoped the settlement would
send a message to chemical companies to be more responsible.
   ``I want this to reach to this chemical company and shake them
up a bit, to make them realize that they are negligent,'' she said.
``I can never go back to 12 and start all over again.''
   Wright's lawsuit centered on two chemicals in Loxene: a
pesticide known as trichlorocarbonilide, or TCC, and
pentachlorophenol, a substance known as penta that is more widely
used as a pesticide and wood preservative.
   Despite being warned as early as 1955 that penta was unsafe
because it caused skin irritations, BASF Wyandotte, then Wyandotte
Chemical Corp., instructed Booth Hospital how to use Loxene in
final laundry rinses to kill mildew, the lawsuit contended.
   The Salvation Army, which operated the now-defunct Booth
Hospital for unwed mothers, previously agreed to pay Wright $5,000,
and Dow Chemical Co. settled for $60,000, Bogard said. Dow and
Monsanto Co. were accused because they manufactured penta and TCC.
Monsanto was dropped as a defendant.
   In a statement, BASF said it ``is not directly responsible for
her (Wright's) condition'' because the hospitals ``disregarded
clearly stated use instructions and warnings.''
   Wright became gravely ill when she was 5 days old but recovered
and was later adopted, her suit says. Often ill in early childhood,
at age 12 she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, an
often fatal bone marrow cancer.
   Because of sealed records, her lawyers said they were able to
trace only eight other babies born at Booth during the time the
hospital used Loxene. The lawyers said those babies also became
severely ill, with high fevers and profuse sweating.
   Two died as infants and a third suffers from a learning
disability, the lawyers said. In 1966, an outbreak of illnesses
attributed to Loxene at Pembina County Hospital in Cavalier, N.D.,
left one infant dead, they said.
   Bogard said Wyandotte Chemical should have removed Loxene from
the market following the North Dakota episode instead of waiting
until the product's registration was revoked more than a year later.

<HEAD>Iran, Iraq Hold First Talks In Nearly Two Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with optimistic comments by U.N.
chief, technical talks to follow, other. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq on Tuesday
held their first direct talks since a cease-fire was declared in
the Persian Gulf War nearly two years ago. The U.N chief described
the talks as a ``pschological breakthrough.''
   Iraq's Tariq Aziz later described his hourlong meeting with
Iran's Ali Akbar Velayati as ``cordial and constructive.''
   The two sides agreed to the direct meeting at the U.N. Geneva
headquarters after separate discussions with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar Monday night and Tuesday.
   Perez de Cuellar called Tuesday's meeting ``very promising and
an excellent omen'' for the success of future negotations to secure
a lasting peace.
   He told reporters no substantive issues were discussed but said
the meeting's friendly atmosphere marked a ``psychological
breakthrough.'' He said agreement by the two foreign ministers to
talk directly was a clear sign that both governments want a
resolution of their bitter conflict.
   Although both Velayati and Aziz were present in the four rounds
of peace talks held since 1988, the two men did not speak directly
to each other, instead relaying their comments through Perez de
Cuellar.
   Peace talks have been deadlocked ever since they started Aug.
25, 1988, just five days after a U.N.-sponsored ceasefire ended the
eight-year Persian Gulf War.
   Perez de Cuellar said contacts with both delegations were
expected to continue this week. Both ministers were scheduled to
leave Geneva Wednesday and no date for a next ministerial meeting
was set.
   The U.N. chief said highly technical negotiations would follow
and that he did not know whether the ministers would like to take
part in these. He also said he was considering a visit to the area
but no time had been fixed.
   The negotiations have bogged down in disputes over
implementation of a resolution calling for a withdrawal to
internationally recognized boundaries.
   Two particular sticking points are the continued presence of
Iraqi troops on 1,000 square miles of Iranian territory, and the
strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway on the southern border of the two
countries.
   Tariq Aziz said preparations were continuing for a proposed
summit between presidents Saddam Hussein of Iraq and Hashemi
Rajsanjani of Iran, but no date had been fixed.
   Perez de Cuellar said plans for a summit featured strongly in
his ``constructive'' discussions with Iran's Velayati late Monday.
   He said of Tuesday's meeting: ``The meeting was not supposed to
be substantive. It was intended to create a different atmosphere as
compared with the previous atmosphere. And from that point of view
I am extremely pleased to have had the two foreign ministers
together in a very friendly, relaxed atmosphere.''
   He declined to speculate about when a final agreement might be
reached, saying very complex problems had to be resolved.

   The foreign minister said Tuesday that
Soviet Jews could begin next week to emigrate to Israel via Finland.
   The operation would make Finland the fourth major route for Jews
emigrating from the Soviet Union, along with Hungary, Romania and
Poland.
   Finnish and Israeli officials confirmed plans last month to
transfer thousands of Soviet Jews to Israel through a small airport
near the Finnish-Soviet border. Then the plans appeared to stall
because Israel refused to guarantee that the immigrants would not
be settled in occupied territories.
   Israel last week said it would not settle Soviet Jews in the
occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   At a news conference after a special Cabinet meeting, Finnish
Foreign Minister Pertti Paasio said the government ``sees no
obstacles to he transit of Soviet Jews to Israel or any other
country via Finland. I think the transfer could begin early next
week.''
   Paasio indicated Tuesday that Finland, although now ready to go
ahead with the transfer of Soviet Jews, was still concerned about
the issue.
   Israel has ``no right to settle its citizens in Palestinian or
Arab territories occupied after 1967,'' Paasio said.
   He said Finnish authorities would allow one transit flight a
week until Oct. 24, and would give permission for flights in
batches of four at a time. Each flight was expected to carry up to
200 Jews.
   Paasio said El Al, the Israeli airline, has applied to begin
flights from Finland.
   He hinted that the flights could be stopped if Israel did not
``follow its policy of . . . not settling Soviet Jews in these
areas.''
   The foreign minister said Soviet Jewish emigrants would be given
Finnish transit visas that could be extended ``if they want to
change their plans and travel elsewhere (than Israel).''
   ``They can also settle in Finland if they want to,'' he said.
   Under the plan, convoys of Finnish buses will shuttle emigrants,
mainly from the Leningrad area, to Lappeenranta, a town with an
airport 12 miles from the Soviet border.
   The Finnish government is also continuing talks with Soviet
officials on direct flights from the Soviet Union to Israel.

<HEAD>FEC Opens Foreign PAC Issue to Comment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission wants to know
whether U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies should be able to
run political action committees in this country.
   The commission voted 4-1 last Thursday to instruct its general
counsel to draft a list of questions on which public comment should
be sought.
   Political action committees, or PACs, are organized by
companies, unions, trade associations and interest groups of all
kinds to solicit money from their members and give it to candidates.
   Contributions from such PACs long have been controversial.
Federal election law bars citizens of foreign countries from making
donations to congressional and presidential elections. But foreign
corporations with wholly owned American subsidiaries are allowed to
have their subsidiaries establish PACs just like any other company,
soliciting from their employees who are American citizens.
   Critics contend that allows foreign interests to influence
elections.
   The proposal to seek public comment was offered by Commissioner
John McGarry, one of three Democrat appointees to the panel. The
two other Democrats and Republican Thomas Josefiak voted to open
the issue to comment. But Josefiak said his vote should not be
taken as an indication he favored a ban on such PACs or any changes
to existing laws, just that he wanted to see what comments would
come in.
   Observers of the FEC believe the panel would split 3-3 if a
commissioner sought an outright ban on such PACs, but the
commission believes it does not have that power and over the years
has asked Congress to deal with the issue.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the Democratic nominee for vice
president in the 1988 election, recently wrote a ``Dear Colleague''
letter suggesting it was time for Congress to determine whether
PACs of foreign-owned U.S. companies should be restricted or banned.

<HEAD>Colombian Army Finds Ton of Dynamite Set To Explode on Highway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army found about a ton of dynamite
that it said drug terrorists planned to use to blast part of the
highway between Bogota and Medellin, Colombia's two largest cities,
a general said Tuesday.
   Elsewhere, leftist guerrillas blew up a section of Colombia's
main oil pipeline Tuesday, temporarily halting pumping of about
230,000 barrels a day, the state oil company Ecopetrol said.
   The 2nd Division discovered the dyamite along the highway about
100 miles northwest of Bogota. Division commander Gen. Jose Guzman
said in a communique that ``narco-subversive'' elements planted the
explosives with the intention of destroying a stretch of highway
and civilian and military vehicles traveling on it.
   In the past 11 months, Colombian drug lords have been blamed for
killing more than 400 people, including around 150 policemen in
Medellin.
   Rebels of the leftist National Liberation Army, the ELN, used
dynamite Tuesday on the Cano Limon oil pipeline in northeast
Colombia.
   A spokesman for Ecopetrol said the bombing caused 4,000 barrels
of crude oil to spill out of the pipeline.
   The ELN, Colombia's most active guerrilla group, has bombed the
pipeline scores of times since 1986, causing estimated losses of
around $520 million. It says it is trying to pressure the
government to reduce the presence of foreign oil companies in
Colombia.
   Tuesday's attack was the 11th this year.

   An oil pipeline company Tuesday proposed
construction of a $500 million terminal and pipeline system to take
oil through Puget Sound without tankers.
   The proposal, which revived a decade-old idea, immediately met
opposition from some environmentalists, who fear moving oil through
the sound by pipeline or tanker risks spills.
   Trans Mountain Pipe Line Co. Ltd. of Vancouver, British
Columbia, said it wants to build a terminal at Low Point on the
Strait of Juan de Fuca, which runs between the United States and
Canada.
   The company would lay two partly submerged, parallel pipelines
that would carry millions of barrels of crude oil about 80 miles to
upper Puget Sound.
   One of the proposed pipelines would carry oil coming in from
Alaska and Asia for processing. The other would meet an existing
pipeline from the Canadian province of Alberta that carries crude
oil bound for export.
   Trans Mountain's first hurdle will be convincing Puget Sound
refiners _ British Petroleum, Atlantic Richfield, Texaco and Shell
Oil _ to use the pipeline at a cost Trans Mountain estimates at
about 40 cents a barrel more than the average cost of transporting
the oil by tanker.
   Trans Mountain President Richard Stokes said initial discussions
have been encouraging. Arco and British Petroleum spokesmen said
they were willing to consider the proposal. Stokes said agreement
would be needed in order to secure the $500 million needed for the
project.
   Trans Mountain also would need approval from the state Energy
Facilities Site Evaluation Council after a long public review
process, Stokes said.
   The announcement came several hours after the release of a
report by a regional oil-spill task force that recommends serious
consideration of an offshore terminal and pipeline system to reduce
the risk of oil spills in Puget Sound.
   The States-British Columbia Task Force said the risk of oil
spills under current circumstances can only increase with expected
rises in tanker traffic in the region.
   Crude oil shipments into Puget Sound, which total about 161
million barrels annually, are expected to increase by 5 percent a
year this decade, the report said, with accompanying increases in
the traffic of refined oil.
   Shipments from Canada to Asian markets also are on the rise, the
task force said, and can be expected to increase more than fivefold
this decade.
   Gov. Booth Gardner, who would have the power to veto the
pipeline project, considers the proposal worthy of study, said
gubernatorial spokesman Dick Milne.
   Environmentalists dismissed it.
   ``Here we go again,'' said Jeff Parsons, a spokesman for the
Washington Audubon Society, recalling the bitter fight a decide ago
over a similar proposal. That plan was ultimately junked by
then-Gov. John Spellman in 1982.
   Parsons said neither pipelines nor tankers are good options for
hauling oil in the sound.
   ``The best option is to establish a national energy policy that
severely reduces our reliance on oil,'' he said. ``The only way to
really prevent spills is to leave oil in the ground.''
   The task force said a terminal and pipeline system, combined
with other spill preventative steps, would reduce the threat of a
large sound spill by 66 percent.
   The proposed pipelines would run by land from the terminal about
12 miles west of Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula to Admiralty
Inlet.
   From there, the lines would run underwater to Whidbey Island in
the sound, cross the island, then go underwater again until
reaching the mainland near Stanwood on the eastern side of the
Puget Sound. The lines then would run north to connect with an
existing pipeline system at Burlington.

<HEAD>Court Says Princeton Eating Clubs Must Admit Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two male-only eating clubs at Princeton
University must end a century-old tradition of excluding women and
open their doors to the opposite sex, the state's highest court
ruled Tuesday.
   The state Supreme Court rejected arguments by the Ivy Club and
the Tiger Inn that they were private entities separate from the Ivy
League university and not subject to the state's
anti-discrimination laws.
   ``It would be disingenuous for the clubs to assert that they
could ever exist apart from Princeton University,'' the
seven-member court said in a unanimous opinion. ``The clubs gather
their membership from Princeton and, in turn, provide the service
of feeding Princeton students.''
   ``Because of this, the clubs lack the distinctly private nature
that would exempt them'' from discrimination laws, the court said.
   The ruling stems from an 11-year-old sex discrimination case
brought by Sally Frank, a former Princeton student who is now a
professor at New York Law School in New York City.
   ``I'm really thrilled,'' Ms. Frank said from Washington, D.C.
``I'm glad that the court decided to stop discrimination at
Princeton.''
   Stockton Williams, 22, undergraduate president of Tiger Inn,
said the ruling would be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We feel that all of the affairs of the club should be decided
by the members, including who we allow in,'' Williams said.
   Barbara Strapp Nelson, a lawyer for the Ivy Club, said the club
``strongly disagreed'' with the court's ruling, which she said
overlooked the constitutionally protected right of freedom of
association.
   ``I think this case has often been viewed as an emotional
women's rights type of case, whereas it's really a case involving
... whether the government should be intervening in decisions made
by individuals as to who they socialize with,'' Ms. Nelson said.
   She said the Ivy Club's governing board would examine its
choices before deciding whether to appeal.
   In 1979 Ms. Frank sued the Ivy Club and the Tiger Inn, the only
two among the university's 13 private eating clubs that exclude
women. Princeton began admitting women in 1969.
   Most juniors and seniors pay membership fees to eat at the
clubs, housed near the Princeton campus.
   Both clubs voted earlier this year to admit women, but two more
rounds of voting must be conducted next year before any can join.
   ``It is undisputed that the clubs had a general policy that
excluded females from consideration as members,'' the court said.
``It is also undisputed that the clubs applied this policy to
Frank'' when she tried to join.
   Attorneys for the two clubs maintained that as private entities,
they had the right to choose their membership.
   But Ms. Frank argued that the university has promoted the clubs
in its publications, and that Princeton has relied on the clubs
since they feed more than 75 percent of upper-class students.
   Tuesday's ruling upheld a 1987 decision by the New Jersey
Division on Civil Rights, which ordered the clubs to begin
admitting women. That decision was overturned by the Appellate
Division of Superior Court, which granted the clubs' request for a
new hearing because of procedural errors.
   But the Supreme Court said the clubs already had been afforded
their administrative due process and said it did not see any
disputed facts.
   Ms. Frank had sued a third eating club, but that club began
admitting women in 1986 and settled with Ms. Frank for $20,000.
   The university also was named in the lawsuit but settled in
1986, paying Ms. Frank $27,500 in legal fees and pledging to
dissociate itself from sexually segregated clubs.
   Under Tuesday's ruling, the two clubs must pay Ms. Frank a total
of $5,000 plus legal fees to be determined by the court.

<HEAD>Nicaragua Declares Strike Illegal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has declared a strike
by government employees illegal and said Tuesday the walkout had
attracted little support among the country's 100,000 public workers.
   Leaders of the pro-Sandinista National Workers' Front called the
strike on Monday to protest firings and demand a say in national
economic policy _ a role the union contends it is guaranteed by the
constitution.
   Government officials said that as of Tuesday, only about 800
employees in three ministries were on strike. At the Managua
mayor's office, 1,200 workers who had joined the walkout on Monday
reached an agreement with the mayor and returned to work Tuesday.
   Union officials, however, gave vastly different figures.
   Lucio Jimenez, leader of the Sandinista Workers' Center, another
union federation, called the strike ``a full success'' and said a
total of 42,000 employees had stayed away from their jobs in
government ministries, the customs service at Managua's
international airport and various state-owned industries _
including construction, textile, metalworking and beer plants.
   An airport customs employee and workers at some of the
state-owned companies, including the Milca bottling plant,
contradicted Jimenez and said they were working normally.
   Telecommunications and postal workers stopped service, including
international telephone service, for one hour Tuesday in support of
the strike. Service then returned to normal. Bus transportation,
electricity, banking, water or other services continued
uninterrupted.
   Riot police and patrol cars cordoned off President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro's offices, keeping away vehicles and
pedestrians, and police were on duty outside state offices to
guarantee entry for the public and employees who wanted to work.
   Labor Minister Francisco Rosales declared the strike illegal
late Monday, saying it was ``strictly political'' and aimed at
``sabotaging the recovery program.''
   The National Workers' Front has sought an injunction from the
appeals court against the decree and protested the banning of
pickets by the Interior Ministry.
   If the court agrees that the strike is illegal, the government
can fire strikers outright, something it would like to do to trim
the bureaucracy.
   The government's economic plans include returning most
state-owned companies to the private sector and reorganizing the
government _ both moves expected to involve job cutbacks.
   The strike differs sharply from a walkout by 65,000 government
employees in May that paralyzed activity across the country,
including international flights and telephone service.
   In May, the demands focused on salary increases and a Sandinista
law protecting government workers' jobs and benefits. That strike
ended after the unions won 100 percent pay hikes and a promise that
the government would not retaliate, a provision union leaders say
has been violated.
   The Chamorro government, they say, has fired more than 800
employees, most of them Sandinistas, since it took office April 25,
two months after winning general elections.
   The new government views the current walkout as a move by the
Sandinistas to assert themselves as an opposition power.
   While most government employees are holdovers from the previous
government, many would rather try to hold onto their jobs than give
open support to the Sandinistas.
   ``Very few are going to support the strike because no one wants
to risk being fired,'' said a telephone operator at the
Construction and Transportation Ministry who asked not to be
identified.
   Unemployment is officially estimated at 34 percent of the work
force of 1.2 million. With the end of the nine-year war by
U.S.-backed Contra rebels against the Sandinistas, the number of
jobless is growing.

   A dozen airplanes crashed in Alaska
over a 30-hour period ending Tuesday, killing two people, causing
tens of thousands of dollars in damage and overwhelming
investigators.
   ``We've had so many crashes in the past two days, it's
awesome,'' said Jim Michelangelo, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board here. ``Call me (next month) and we'll
have them analyzed and we may know the causes.''
   Pilot error, mechanical problems, bad weather, impatient
passengers and pilot unfamiliarity with terrain and weather are
most commonly cited as the cause of Alaska's airplane accidents.
   Since June 1, 35 airplanes have crashed in Alaska. Ten people
have died in four separate accidents, Michelangelo said. Five were
killed in a June 25 crash of a Cessna 207 on what was to have been
an 80-minute sightseeing trip out of Seward.
   Ten of the accidents involved air-taxi operators; 25 involved
private aircraft, Michelangelo said.
   There are 219 air-taxi operators in Alaska and more than 9,000
private airplanes and registered pilots, said Paul Steucke,
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration here.
   That translates into about eight times as many pilots per capita
_ and 15 times as many aircraft per capita _ as the rest of the
United States, the FAA says.
   Most pilots and air-taxi operators in Alaska are conscientious
about safety and do a good job, Steucke said. He said their clients
sometimes unwittingly play a role in accidents by pressuring pilots
to take risks.
   Tourists typically are on a tight schedule and sometimes
reluctant to wait out bad weather, he said.
   ``Sometimes they go down the street looking for another carrier
after one pilot tells them it's too dangerous to fly,'' he said.
   There were a dozen crashes within 30 hours starting Sunday
evening and ending early Tuesday.
   In the only fatal wreck, the private pilot's lack of familiarity
with local wind patterns may have contributed to a crash at Iliamna
Lake Sunday that killed two people, said Bob Cusack, a lodge owner
who helped rescue the four survivors.
   Cusack, a guide and pilot himself, said gusty winds that evening
had dissuaded him from flying some clients back to Anchorage, about
200 miles away.

   A New York toy manufacturer recalled more than
54,000 duck decoy pull toys Tuesday because the toy may pose a
choking and sharp-point hazard to young children.
   The screw holding the duck's wing in place separated from the
10-inch decoy in tests, said the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The ducks, made of yellow and orange plastic by Artsana of
America Inc. of New York, have been sold nationwide since 1987.
   The toys have four wheels, movable feet, wings, eyes and beak
and make a quacking sound when pulled. The name ``Chicco'' is
printed in blue just above the duck's right wing and the packing
box is labeled in part: ``No. 63002.0 Decoy Duck Made in Italy,''
said the agency.
   There have been no reports of injuries. Consumers are advised to
return the ducks to the store where purchased for a refund.

<TEXT>
   Many women over 50 years old don't get mammograms
because they mistakenly think they don't need them, according to an
American Medical Association study released Tuesday.
   The study found that while more than 90 percent of the women
polled in various surveys visited a doctor regularly, just 25
percent to 41 percent received X-ray breast examinations during the
previous year.
   Most of the women who didn't receive a mammography said they
skipped the breast cancer screening procedure because they didn't
think it was necessary or because they didn't have any breast
problems, the study found. The next-largest group said their
doctors never recommended the examination.
   ``This relatively low utilization of breast cancer screening may
help to explain why breast cancer mortality rates have not declined
over the past three decades,'' the report says.
   The American Cancer Society recommends women have one mammogram
between the ages of 35 and 39, one every to two years between 40
and 49, and one annually after that.
   The National Cancer Institute and the National Health Interview
Survey interviewed 7,011 women from 50 to 74 years old across the
country in different studies between 1987 and 1989. The combined
results were reported in this week's edition of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   Less-educated and poorer women were even less likely to receive
breast cancer screenings, the survey found.
   Doctors are hesitant to recommend the procedure because they
feel patients are reluctant to get mammograms or will object to the
costs, the study indicated. But few women surveyed said they failed
to get one because of the cost or because of radiation fears.

   Israel's ambassador to Egypt, Shimon Shamir,
announced his resignation Tuesday over policy differences with the
right-wing government formed last month.
   ``There is too wide a gap between my views and that of the new
government,'' his letter of resignation letter said, according to
Israel radio.
   Shamir said on the radio his action had nothing to do with the
stalemated Middle East peace process, in which Egypt has tried to
mediate between Israel and the Palestinians.
   ``My decision to resign came the day the new government was
installed. It is a question of my overall world view compared to
the overall platform of the existing government,'' he said.
   He was the third Israeli ambassador appointed to Cairo since a
peace treaty was signed in 1979, and the first to quit because of
political disagreement.
   Shamir was named to the post in August 1988 by then-Foreign
Minister Shimon Peres of the center-left Labor Party.
   A new government led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir _ no
relation _ of the right-wing Likud bloc was formed June 11 after a
Likud-Labor coalition collapsed in March over differences on peace
moves.
   The Haaretz daily noted that since the new government took
office, friction had emerged between the ambassador and a top
political aide to Prime Minister Shamir over the government's
harder line in diplomatic contacts with Egypt.
   Ambassador Shamir said he would stay on until a replacement is
found, but planned to return to his research and lecturing job at
Tel Aviv University.

   The rockets' red glare burst through the air

Fourths across the United States as people accommodate themselves
to a holiday that officially falls smack in the middle of the week.
   George Zambelli Jr., a vice president of Zambelli Fireworks
Internationale of New Castle, Penn., sees a trend.
   ``People are thinking of the Fourth of July in terms of three to
four days before and three to four days after,'' Zambelli said in a
telephone interview from Portland, Maine. ``To me, it's immaterial
what day it's on. I love fireworks.''
   He would have loved the ``Celebration of the Century'' in Boise,
Idaho, which at least had the benefit of historical accuracy.
Tuesday's celebration had nothing to do with the nation's
independence _ it was to celebrate Idaho's centennial as a state.
   ``This is as close as Boise can get to Mardi Gras,'' Idaho
Supreme Court Justice Larry Boyle said as the celebration got under
way. Idaho was admitted to the union on July 3, 1890.
   The events included picnics at four Boise city parks, a
motorcade of vintage cars, a 43-cannon salute, a jet flyover, a
huge birthday cake _ and fireworks.
   The Zambellis didn't produce the Idaho celebration, but they had
their hands full elsewhere. On Monday, they presented fireworks at
Detroit's International Freedom Festival. On Tuesday, they were
scheduled to present Pittsburgh's show and a performance for
President Bush at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   They were scheduled to produce shows Wednesday in Philadelphia
and Thursday in Washington, D.C.
   Philadelphia, the birthplace of the Declaration of Independence,
had an especially elaborate celebration planned for Wednesday. It
was to begin with the presentation of the second annual
Philadelphia Liberty Medal to former President Carter.
   Later, Carter was to join Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode in
cutting ``America's Birthday Cake,'' which is big enough to serve
25,000 people.
   Other events include the ``Liberty to Liberty Triathlon,'' the
``Great American Liberty Parade'' and a concert at the Philadelphia
Museum of Art.
   And, of course, fireworks.
   Two of the more unusual July Fourth events involve flag-burning,
which was recently upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   In Pensacola, Fla., Boy Scouts and veterans will burn American
flags _ out of reverence, not protest. The flags are old and worn
out, and are being ``retired.''
   Walter O'Neal, president of the Northwest Florida Veterans
Roundtable, said some veterans initially had reservations about the
ceremony but now are statisfied it will be properly respectful.
   ``As long as it's a solemn ceremony, and with the Boys Scouts
involved it will be, we're happy,'' O'Neal said.
   In Little Rock, Ark., a black activist intends to burn the U.S.
flag on the steps of the state Capitol while about 100 state and
local police keep members of the Ku Klux Klan from interfering.
   Activist Robert ``Say'' McIntosh of Little Rock wasn't clear
about why he wanted to burn the flag. ``It is my right, so I'll do
it,'' he said Tuesday.
   In Pittsburgh, an aide to Pittsburgh Public Safety Director
Glenn Cannon said the decision to celebrate Independence Day on
July 3 was intended to save overtime pay for police, paramedics and
parks workers.
   Aide Craig Merritt said city employees typically draw pay 2{
times their normal rate on holidays. They were to receive no bonus
Tuesday if they were already scheduled to work. Those called in to
work overtime were to be paid at 1{ times the normal rate.
   ``The administration thinks the most patriotic thing to do is
not to raise taxes,'' said Al Neri, a spokesman for Mayor Sophie
Masloff. ``History tells us the actual document was signed July 2
... so we've picked a middle ground.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Mexican divers joined forces Tuesday
to try to uncover historical treasures from a U.S. Navy brig that
sank off the coast of Veracruz during the Mexican War.
   The Navy brig Somers already holds a place in literary history.
On an 1842 trip to Africa its captain hanged three Navy trainees
suspected of planning a mutiny. Author Herman Melville based his
novella ``Billy Budd, Foretopman'' on the incident.
   In 1846, the two-masted wooden sailing ship sank during a squall
while helping blockade the port of Veracruz during the war between
Mexico and the United States.
   San Francisco underwater explorer George Belcher discovered the
Somers' well-preserved remains in June 1986 about five miles off
the coast of Veracruz. The ship was partly buried in sand about 110
feet underwater, Belcher said.
   ``It's literally a time capsule from its period,'' Belcher said
in a telephone interview from Veracruz. ``It has everything a U.S.
warship in 1846 would have had on it.''
   On a previous dive to the wreck, Belcher said he found swords,
pistols, crystal wine glasses and bottles, and at least six of the
ship's 10 cannons.
   On Tuesday, a Mexican navy patrol boat carrying a 14-member
U.S.-Mexican exploration team headed to the site of the wreck in
the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``This is the first time that the U.S. and Mexican governments
have conducted an investigation of a sunken ship together,'' said
Mexican Adm. Florencio Aguilar, contacted by telephone in Veracruz.
   Belcher and his brother Joel are guiding the team that includes
representatives from the Mexican Navy, Mexico's National
Anthropology and Archeology Institute and the U.S. National Park
Service.
   Team members said they plan to spend six days mapping, drawing,
and photographing the wreck, but will not remove any artifacts at
this point.
   Another dive is planned for May, and exploration could last for
years, Belcher said. He is producing a documentary film of the
exploration.
   The discovery of the wreck set off a claims dispute between
Mexican and U.S. authorities, but both sides eventually agreed to
the joint exploration.
   The Mexican government claims the wreck is the property of
Mexico, and constitutes spoils of war.
   The wreck is protected under a federal law covering
archeological and historical areas and monuments, said Daniel
Nahmad, director of the Veracruz Regional Anthropology and
Archeology Institute.
   ``It is in national waters, but the United States considers it a
war grave. That's more or less the argument,'' Nahmad said.
   Thirty-two U.S. sailors went down with the ship, said James
Delgado, the U.S. National Park Service's chief maritime historian,
who is a member of the exploration team.
   A bill is before U.S. Senate that calls for bilateral
negotiations to allow the United States to take possession of any
artifacts and human remains found on the Somers.
   Both sides agreed to the joint exploration project Nov. 28,
Belcher said.
   ``At this point, (the artifacts) certainly belong to the Mexican
government,'' Belcher said. ``It is hoped that at some point they
might be loaned to the U.S. government.''
   The Mexican government is in charge of the exploration, and the
National Park Service is representing the U.S. government, because
it is the only government branch that has an underwater archeology
team, Delgado said.
   The Mexican War began in 1846 and was sparked by the U.S.
annexation of Texas. U.S. troops led by Gen. Zachary Taylor invaded
Mexico, and captured Veracruz in March 1847 and Mexico City in
September 1847. The war ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
in 1848 in which Mexico ceded two-fifths of its territory to the
United States, including most of the present southwestern states.

<TEXT>
   A fire apparently ignited by workmen
using a propane torch destroyed a 100-year-old section of the city
jail Tuesday, forcing the evacuation of 375 inmates, authorities
said.
   Two firefighters and a correction officer suffered minor
injuries, authorities said.
   No inmates escaped during the evacuation, said Mayor Mary Moran.
   The blaze broke out about 11 a.m. in the jail's east wing. The
three-story, wood-and-brick structure is the oldest of four
buildings comprising the Bridgeport Correctional Center. The jail
houses a total of 1,000 inmates.
   The fire burned more than four hours before firefighters brought
it under control around 3:30 p.m. It spewed smoke far into the air
and was visible for miles away.
   SWAT team officers from the Correctional Emergency Response Team
were dispatched to oversee the evacuation, which authorities
described as orderly. About 30 state troopers were also placed on
standby as a precaution.
   The inmates evacuated from the east wing were taken to fenced
recreational areas within the compound.
   ``We met no resistance,'' said state police Lt. Richard Brozek.
   Anxious relatives of inmates gathered behind the yellow-police
tape across from the jail, awaiting word of loved ones.
   ``I'm counting on God,'' said Mildred Ramos of Bridgeport, who
said her son was a prisoner at the jail.
   A construction worker said that workers were using a propane
torch to melt rubber to lay a new roof on top of the building. The
fire apparently burned through the roof, then raced through the
attic and destroyed the building, which houses cells, a cafeteria
and a classroom.
   ``As we were putting it out, it just got ahead of us,'' said
Assistant Fire Chief Anthony Petrucelli, who declared the east wing
a total loss.
   The Bridgeport Correctional Center houses minimum-, medium- and
maximum- security prisoners. The east wing was a medium-security
area.
   Correction officials weren't sure where the displaced prisoners
would be sent, but insisted that Connecticut's crowded prisons had
the space to absorb them.
   ``Every inmate will have a bed tonight,'' said Correction
Department spokesman William Wheeler.

<HEAD>Kemp Criticizes U.S. For Ignoring Its Inner Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack Kemp, the U.S. Housing and Urban Development
secretary, called the United States ``hypocritical'' on Tuesday for
promoting democratic market economies in other countries while
ignoring its own inner cities.
   He told a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in London
that economic opportunities must be available for all U.S.
citizens, adding:
   ``Currently, it is more attractive for many citizens in the
inner cities to take what is on offer from the welfare system than
work, and we must change this.''
   The secretary said, ``It is slightly hypocritical for the United
States to tell the world that democratic capitalist economics can
work when it can not even introduce capitalist economics to its own
inner cities.''
   Kemp predicted that East Germany will prove to be an economic
showpiece.
   ``East Germany will, I believe, be the laboratory which proves
to the Soviet Union and the rest of the communist world that sound
market economies, approved and trusted by the people through
democratic processes, is the real way forward.''
   The former Republican presidential candidate said it was up to
Western governments to assist the world's burgeoning democracies.
   ``The point is not who has won but that it has been the victory
of ideas over armed might,'' he said.
   ``What the revolution in Eastern Europe is proving is that
socialism and communism have failed. It is now up to us in the West
to prove that democracy and market forces are a morally profitable
alternative that can deliver materially the opportunities for
wealth creation and prosperty.''
   Later Kemp toured the London Docklands, a large office and
housing development in eastern London.
   Kemp arrived Tuesday and will be in London for the NATO summit
scheduled for Thursday and Friday, said Mara Papatheodorou at the
American Chamber of Commerce.

<HEAD>UN Chief Says Nearly 22,000 Rebel Fighters Demobilized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. troops have demobilized 21,863
Nicaraguan Contras _ a number far higher than the estimated
strength of the rebel force _ and collected 17,883 weapons from
them.
   In a report released Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar said United Nations peacekeeping troops completed the
demobilization of all but about 70 Contras by Thursday.
   The remaining rebels were believed to have been demobilized
since.
   The report refers to both armed and unarmed rebels, including
wounded and ex-combatants. It does not say whether family members
were included in the figure of 21,863, which seems high.
   But judging by the number of rebels the report says had been
armed _ 16,388 _ it appears most of those demobilized were
combatants.
   The U.S.-backed rebels were thought to have about 11,000
combatants and an undetermined number of support personnel in the
last years of their war against the leftist Sandinista government.
   The war ended after the Sandinistas were voted out of office in
February, ending their 10-year rule of the Central American nation.
   U.N. troops in both Nicaragua and Honduras _ where the Contras
had been based _ photographed the rebels, then collected and
destroyed their weapons under an agreement reached in April between
the Sandinistas, the government-elect and the rebels.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, whose U.S.-backed
coalition won the February elections, took office later that month.
   Unarmed rebels who were demobilized provided proof from their
commanders that they had fought in the resistance. Such
documentation was required for their demobilization and
resettlement aid.
   The U.N. report said 2,607 rebels were demobilized in four
locations in Honduras, including 2,390 who were unarmed and 217 who
had weapons.
   In Nicaragua, 19,256 were demobilized in 10 locations, including
16,171 who were armed and 3,085 who had no weapons.
   The list of weapons totaled 17,883, including 112 SAM-7 and
Redeye missiles, 14,920 small arms, 4 heavy machine guns, 134
mortars, 1,265 grenade launchers, 1,310 grenades and 138 mines, the
U.N. report said.
   The rebels had for many years maintained base camps in Honduras,
which borders Nicaragua to the north.

<HEAD>World Bank Signs $250 Million Loan For Poland, Opens Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank has opened its first
permanent office in Eastern Europe, and also granted Poland a $250
million loan for development of natural gas resources and energy
conservation.
   At Monday's opening, World Bank Vice President Will Wapenhans
lauded the economic stabilization accomplished by post-communist
Poland's shock reform plan, but urged ``even more rapid'' steps
toward creating a market economy.
   The World Bank has loaned Poland $781 million for five projects
since lending to the country resumed in January. Officials say
about $2 billion more in loans are envisioned during the next two
fiscal years.
   The new loan is to help wean Poland from its dependence on
inefficient and environmentally damaging coal.
   The World Bank mission in Warsaw will provide advice, technical
assistance and financial services for Poland's economic overhaul.
   Proposed terms for a $300 million ``structural adjustment
loan,'' representing World Bank endorsement of Poland's plan for
shifting from centrally-planned socialism to market-driven
capitalism, are being reviewed by the government.
   The loan is to be used to assist Poland in reorganizing its debt
to the West, now estimated at $42.2 billion. Approval by the World
Bank directors is expected by fall, officials say.
   ``Whether we will be able to continue this level of (lending)
operations is dependent on Poland being able to support and
implement a debt management strategy that will return it to a
reasonable level of creditworthiness,'' Wapenhans said.
   The accomplishments of the first phase of the economic reform,
including the curbing of runaway inflation, are impressive,
Wapenhans said.
   But he said the accompanying ``very severe contraction'' of the
economy, including a 40 percent drop in real incomes and declining
industrial output, leads the World Bank to ``hope for even more
rapid implementation of parts of the plan.''
   In the second phase of reforms, a key step is continuing to
strip away artificial pricing structures that were a hallmark of
the highly subsidized socialist economy.
   The energy development loan calls for increasing domestic
natural gas supplies by about 20 percent, said Mieczyslaw
Kaczmarczyk, director of the energy enterprise being supported by
the loan.
   He said ``long-term negligence'' had retarded development of gas
and other clean energy resources, noting that Poland produced more
natural gas in the 1970s than it does now.
   Coal has traditionally been a key source of foreign export
income for Poland, which has sent most of its low-sulfur coal
abroad and used the remainder at home, resulting in a dramatic air
pollution problem.
   The Washington-based World Bank is supported by more than 150
countries. Poland rejoined in June 1986.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when teacher union chief Albert Shanker was
starting to sound like a mellowed elder statesman, the old
firebrand re-emerged with an attack on school boards and
administrators he accuses of impeding reform.
   In his opening address Monday before 3,200 delegates at the
American Federation of Teachers annual convention, Shanker
virtually declared an end to the decades-old feud with the National
Education Association.
   The two teacher unions are finally cooperating, seeing
eye-to-eye on most key issues, he said _ though officials of both
unions hastened to add that merger is at best a distant dream.
   Moments later, the president of the 744,000-member AFT, once
considered so feisty that Woody Allen portrayed him as the cause of
World War III in the film ``Sleeper,'' told reporters that school
boards and administrators have failed to act on reform despite his
union's flexibility.
   Insisting he was not trying to ``hurt'' or ``destroy'' school
leaders, he said, ``What I'm shocked about is they're not acting
like intelligent managers.''
   Unless reform proceeds more quickly, Shanker warned, the public
will turn to more drastic schemes like giving parents the right to
use tax dollars to send their kids wherever they want, including
private school.
   Such a plan already is in place in Milwaukee, he pointed out.
   Those were just his opening shots. Shanker indicated he'd have
more to say on Wednesday in an address to the convention.
   National School Boards Association executive director Thomas
Shannon replied by calling Shanker ``myopic and forgetful.''
   ``One of the biggest obstacles to change is collective
bargaining contracts. You can't always just change things,'' said
Shannon, reached by telephone at his Washington office.
   ``We have no doubt about the sincerity of Al Shanker,'' said
Gary Marx, spokesman for the American Association of School
Administrators. ``And he should have no doubt about our commitment
to better schools.''
   The AFT gathering runs through Thursday. More than 8,000
delegates of the 2-million-member NEA will meet in Kansas City
Thursday through Sunday.
   In another development, the AFT released a survey showing
average teacher pay in the United States up 5.7 percent to $31,315.
Alaska was tops with an average salary of $43,097. South Dakota
ranked last at $21,300.

   A pair of graduate students from Iran
stood next to an earthquake relief booth outside the main gates of
Penn State University and waited. And waited. And waited.
   They discovered that, despite a history of compassion, many
Americans aren't willing to help a country they link to
hostage-taking and terrorism.
   ``Many people have the feeling that they should not help Iran,''
said Mohammad Sadaghiani, president of the school's Iranian-Muslim
Student Association.
   The project director for one relief group that has delivered
goods to Iranian quake victims calls that attitude embarrassing.
``It's saddening. It's a shame,'' said Doyt Conn, from AmeriCares
of New Canaan, Conn.
   The American Red Cross said Monday that contributions to an
Iranian earthquake fund are far below the amounts raised after
temblors in San Francisco, Mexico and Soviet Armenia.
   ``Many Americans will contribute, but there are a large number
who will say, `Let them take that,' or `Let them call on Khomeini
to take care of that,' which will be hard for him to do from the
grave,'' said Roy Austin, an associate professor of sociology at
Penn State.
   The Iranian earthquake occurred June 21. It measured between 7.3
and 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground movement, and killed between
40,000 and 60,000 people.
   The Iranian temblor was stronger than either last October's
Northern California earthquake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter
scale, or the 6.9 quake that killed 25,000 in Armenia in December
1988.
   Every increase of one on the Richter scale indicates a quake
that is 10 times stronger.
   In the 1{ weeks after the Armenia quake, the Red Cross received
more than $3 million for relief efforts, said Jim Cassell, an
agency spokesman in Washington, D.C. As of Monday, the relief group
had received $376,410 _ or about a tenth of the Armenian figure _
for the Iranian effort, he said.
   Cassell said after each recent earthquake, relief was dependent
upon how the news media reported the disasters.
   ``Is it at the level of Armenia? No. But was Armenia at the
level of Mexico? No. Was Mexico at the level of San Francisco?
No,'' Cassell said. ``If the story gets buried, the contributions
subside.''
   The San Francisco quake occurred while millions were watching
the 1989 World Series on national television. For days, it was
featured prominently in the nation's newspapers. The Armenian quake
occurred during the holiday season, a natural time for giving.
   The Iranian quake already has been knocked from Page 1 by
stories on German reunification and President Bush's relaxing of
his ``no new taxes'' stand. ``If it was another country, the news
wouldn't be diminished as quickly,'' Sadaghiani said last week.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Monday thanked 98
countries for assistance, but left out the United States, which the
State Department says has given $760,000 in aid from government and
private sources. He also ignored relief efforts by Iraq and Saudi
Arabia.
   ``It's unfortunate that people don't forget these things during
times of disaster, but human beings are vengeful,'' he said.
   Iranians stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979,
and held 52 Americans for 444 days. Also, American officials blamed
Iran's late religious leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for more-recent
terrorism and hostage-taking.
   ``The United States has not settled its accounts with Iran,''
Austin said. ``It will be a while before people feel like
establishing any kind of normal relationship with Iran.''
   At the Penn State donation booths, which will be open until the
Independence Day break, Americans and foreigners were giving, but
foreigners gave more per person, said Nader Tabatabaee, an Iranian
Penn State student.
   The bulk of contributions flowing through the AmeriCares group
were from corporations or cities that have needed assistance in the
past, its officials said.
   ``The communities of Charleston, South Carolina, and Charlotte
(N.C.) contacted us last week and asked if they could get
involved,'' said Steve Norman, AmeriCares' vice president. The
cities were hit by Hurricane Hugo last year.
   The Iranian embassy at the United Nations also has lent its
backing to a relief fund and is fielding calls generated by an
advertisement Monday in The New York Times.
   ``This is a purely humanitarian issue,'' said Amir Zamani, first
secretary of the Iranian mission to the U.N. ``There are people who
are in need of shelter and food. Humanity understands that as
such.''

   Brian Horton, a veteran Associated Press photo
executive, has been named the agency's senior photo editor for
sports.
   The appointment was announced by Vin Alabiso, the AP's executive
photo editor, at a meeting of AP Sports Editors, an organization of
member newspaper editors. He said Horton will be responsible for
planning and monitoring AP's sports photo coverage worldwide.
   ``Sports is an area of enormous reader interest, and we are
giving a senior executive full responsibility for our sports
coverage because this area is so important to our members,''
Alabiso said.
   For the past two years, Horton, 40, has overseen the AP's
day-to-day photo report in the United States as director of the
LaserPhoto picture network. He also has conducted dozens of
seminars for newspapers on the use of color pictures.
   Horton joined the AP as a photo editor in Chicago in 1971. He
transferred to Philadelphia as a photographer in 1972 and to
Cincinnati in 1975. He was named photo editor in Columbus in 1980,
responsible for the Ohio photo report, and two years later moved to
the New York photo desk as photo enterprise editor.
   Horton is the author of ``The Picture: An Associated Press Guide
to Good News Photography,'' and with his wife, Marilyn Dillon,
compiled an AP book, ``Great Moments in Sports.''
   He is a native of Richmond, Ind.

   For three months, Imelda Marcos suffered through
daily ridicule, bouts of illness and endless hours of courtroom
testimony about her profligate spending.
   After a federal court jury declared on Monday that she was
innocent of racketeering, obstructing justice and mail fraud, Mrs.
Marcos, on her 61st birthday, got down and walked the length of St.
Patrick's Cathedral _ on her knees.
   It was the sort of center stage drama Mrs. Marcos relished
during her years as the first lady of the Philippines, a woman who
rose from obscure beginnings to call herself the ``Mother of the
Nation'' and traveled among her people like a queen.
   Imelda Remedios Visitacion Romualdez was born July 2, 1929, to
Vicente Romualdez, a lawyer sometimes portrayed as from the poorer
branch of one of the Philippines' most prominent families.
   A beauty contest winner, she became the wife of Ferdinand
Marcos, a brilliant lawyer and self-proclaimed World War II hero.
When Marcos was elected president in 1965, the couple were compared
by an adoring world press to U.S. President John F. Kennedy and his
first lady, Jacqueline.
   They had three children: daughter Imee, now living in exile in
Morocco, daughter Irene, and son Ferdinand Jr., known as Bong Bong.
   Meanwhile, Benigno Aquino Jr., who had been one of Imelda's
suitors, married Corazon Cojuangco. He was driven into exile in the
United States by Marcos and was murdered on his return in 1983.
Although they emphatically denied it, Marcos and his wife were
widely accused by Filipino critics of ordering Aquino's
assassination, and his death put in motion the events that drove
Marcos from power three years later.
   In the 20 years that Marcos served as president, ``Meldy'' was
always at his side, an inseparable part of the power structure that
doled out favors and collected tribute.
   Marcos made her his envoy to the United Nations, and designated
her ``presidential envoy plenipotentiary,'' dispatching her on good
will missions to the Soviet Union, China and other countries.
   She was credited by the pro-Marcos media with negotiating oil
deals and diplomatic settlements. Later, as the appointed governor
of Metro Manila, she built hotels, schools, hospitals and a
cultural center. As Minister of Human Settlements, she tried to
improve housing and services for the impoverished.
   In an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country of 62 million, she
practiced her religion publicly and for political effect.
   She brought celebrities such as actor George Hamilton into her
inner circle, traveled with a coterie of loyalists known as the
``blue ladies'' for their dress, and threw frequent parties at
which she invariably sang to her guests, sometimes rendering songs
that she wrote herself.
   She became famous for spending sprees at boutiques, department
stores and jewelers during frequent trips to New York and travels
elsewhere.
   Critics assailed her jet-set life style while much of her
country struggled in poverty. She responded by insisting that the
people admired her and drew hope, from her example, of a better
life.
   It all ended in ignominy in 1986 when, after calling a spot
election to cement his control and apparently losing to Mrs. Aquino
in balloting riddled by official fraud, Marcos was driven from
power by a ``people's revolution'' and fled to exile in Hawaii.
   Left behind, along with thousands of documents that would later
be used to incriminate the Marcoses in a vast web of corruption,
were Imelda's shoes _ more than 1,000 pairs, closer to 3,000 by
some estimates.
   The government accused her of helping to steal $222 million from
her nation's treasury and using the money to invest secretly in New
York real estate and other items. Most of the prospective jurors
interviewed for the trial said they knew little about her except
that she had a lot of shoes.
   In court, she wore black mourning clothes for her husband who
died last September. One New York newspaper _ Newsday _ printed a
photo of her shoes every day of the trial.
   Twice she suffered attacks of high blood pressure, interrupting
the trial and prompting doctors to fit her with a special monitor.
Another time she was hospitalized for four days after collapsing at
the defense table, vomiting blood from what was diagnosed as a
stomach ailment.
   On Monday, after three months, enough testimony to fill nearly
6,000 pages of transcript and five days of deliberation, the jury
acquitted Mrs. Marcos on all charges.
   Imelda Marcos pronounced herself ``vindicated,'' and went to
church to pray. But in victory, she was denied the thing that she
has professed to want most: the right to go home and take her
husband's body with her for burial.
   A spokeswoman for the Aquino government said it still considered
Imelda Marcos a ``security threat,'' and the official policy
barring her return had not changed.

   Gross national product, retail sales, consumer
prices, productivity, home sales, factory orders, trade,
unemployment _ these are among the economic barometers
systematically tracked by the federal government to help determine
the overall economy's direction, and they're not pointing to a
recession. But are these numbers reliable? This third part of a
four-part series explains why commonly used federal measurements of
economic performance are drawing increased criticism.

   The government's number mills are in trouble.
   At a time when the U.S. economy never has been more complex,
federal statisticians are losing the ability to track the changes.
   The official statistics report that the nation is currently in
the midst of a period of unsurpassed prosperity _ a peacetime
record of 7{ years without a recession.
   But private economists say many of the statistics spewed by the
government each month that purport to track the economy are
seriously flawed. Some are so suspect that analysts ignore them in
preparing forecasts rather than face embarrassment when the
government totally revises its original report.
   ``History is being rewritten on a monthly basis,'' said Allen
Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``It makes it very hard
for private sector analysts and public policy makers to come to
correct conclusions.''
   Take the chagrin caused last year with the monthly report on
retail sales. The government first reported retail sales fell by
0.1 percent in May 1989 only to discover belatedly that the survey
had overlooked $1.4 billion in sales.
   Thus, a small decline turned into a sizable 0.8 percent increase.
   But the problem didn't stop there. The initial erroneous report
was picked up in the government's broadest measure of economic
activity _ the gross national product _ which originally showed an
anemic 1.7 percent growth rate during the spring.
   After the error in retail sales was caught, the GNP report was
revised to show the economy growing at a much more respectable 2.5
percent. But the correction came too late to stop policy makers at
the Federal Reserve from acting to cut interest rates for fear the
economy was headed into recession.
   A number of economists believe the Fed has been forced to keep
interest rates higher this year because of that mistaken easing in
credit last year.
   Bad data triggers more than bad government policy.
   Millions of dollars can be lost in seconds on Wall Street based
on investors' jittery response to the latest report, even though
bad news one month might be revised to look significantly better a
month later.
   The Consumer Price Index affects the pocketbook of virtually
every American in a different way.
   The CPI, the government's most closely watched measure of
inflation, is used to adjust the monthly payments of 38 million
Social Security beneficiaries, 20 million food stamp recipients,
3.5 million federal retirees and at least 8.5 million workers
covered by collective bargaining contracts that link wage increases
to CPI increases.
   Even the amount of taxes we pay is affected because the CPI is
used each year to adjust rates to prevent inflation-induced tax
increases known as ``bracket-creep.''
   In studying government data, everyone from the National Academy
of Sciences to the National Association of Business Economists has
reached the same conclusion _ there are serious problems regarding
the accuracy and usefulness of the statistics.
   A survey last year of NABE members found 72 percent were unhappy
with the quality of government data, up from 61 percent the year
before. Retail sales, GNP and merchandise trade reports were
identified as the worst offenders.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers and head of an administration statistics task force
exploring the issue, said that deteriorating statistics partly
reflect a more complex economy.
   ``When we as a nation produced mostly things like steel and
bushels of wheat, output was easy to count,'' Boskin said. ``Tons
of steel and bushels of wheat.''
   But today, in an economy where 75 percent of the output is in
service industries, ranging from banks and hospitals to fast-food
franchises and video rental outlets, output is more difficult to
measure.
   How, for example, Boskin asks, do you assign a value to the
increased output and productivity from an innovation such as
24-hour teller machines?
   Many economists, however, believe a complex economy is only
partly to blame for the slump in data reliability. In their view,
the bigger culprit was the Reagan administration. Budget cuts
forced staff reductions at the statistics agencies and cut into the
research needed to keep sampling techniques current with a changing
economy.
   Former Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner, who oversaw the
work at the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis
during the Reagan administration, says austere budgets during this
time did have an effect.
   ``Because of the cutbacks, we had to delay some things that we
felt strongly we wanted to do,'' said Ortner, who has written a
book on economic policy-making during the Reagan years titled
``Voodoo Deficits.''
   One of the delayed projects was an effort to modernize U.S.
statistics and make them more comparable to the economic
bookkeeping done in other countries, Ortner said.
   The unreliability of the data often is magnified when it comes
to tracking economic activity in specific areas of the country, in
part because the government does not provide the money to gather
large enough samples.
   ``Within the past decade, we have had much greater diversity in
regional performance than we have ever had before, starting with
the farm depression and the manufacturing depression in the early
1980s and then the drop in oil prices which killed Texas,'' said
Ben Laden, a private economist who studied the statistics problem
for NABE. ``But the federal government is doing very little to
track regional differences.''
   Paul Getman, head of Regional Financial Associates, a private
economic consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., agrees, complaining
that the government produces few statistics on regional economic
activity on a timely basis.
   ``It doesn't make a lot of sense to talk about national trends
in housing, real estate markets, consumer spending and employment
because regional growth patterns can be very different,'' he said.
   Even the national statistics can mislead because of the huge
revisions, Getman said.
   ``You become very leery about using these numbers, but they are
all you have so you grasp at them and hope the government won't
make a fool of you in the next 30 days,'' he said.
   The Bush administration has sought money to strengthen the
system of reporting economic statistics, but Congress turned down
its request for $20 million in additional funds last year, citing
budget restraints caused by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   The administration managed to salvage part of its rescue program
by reshuffling available funds. This year, it came back with an
even more ambitious request for $50 million to overhaul 25
statistical areas.
   Michael Darby, who took Ortner's post as statistics chief at
Commerce, said he hopes Congress will deal more favorably with this
year's spending request.
   ``Everybody loses if we don't have good data and that results in
policy errors which cause a recession,'' he said. ``That ruins the
budget and ruins politicians' re-election chances.''

<TEXT>
   Wearing an ``I love Peoria'' T-shirt, an
Illinois gold miner freed by Colombian rebels after 61 days
returned to the United States and his hometown Monday. He said his
kidnappers had treated him ``with great respect.''
   Scott Heimdal, 27, said earlier in Miami that he was trying to
find words to thank those in his hometown of Peoria who helped his
family raise the $60,000 ransom they gave the communist People's
Liberation Army to win his release Friday.
   ``Everybody's been so supportive _ even strangers, people who
don't know the family,'' he said. ``I owe a debt I probably will
never be able to repay.''
   Heimdal arrived at Miami International Airport with his mother,
Marge. They flew to Chicago and then to Peoria, where they arrived
around 9:30 p.m.
   ``It's a great feeling'' to be back, Heimdal told a news
conference in Peoria.
   He said that when his kidnappers released him after they
received the ransom, they wished him, ``Good luck.''
   Heimdal said he had to convince his captors that his parents
were not rich after the rebels demanded even more money at one
point. ``In Latin America there's this conception that being from
North America means you're rich,'' he said.
   Heimdal said the kidnappers originally sought $1.2 million, but
he convinced them his family didn't have that kind of money.
   He and his mother were greeted at the airport by about 100
friends and relatives carrying welcome-home signs.
   The crowd applauded as Heimdal and his mother entered the
terminal with Peoria Mayor Jim Maloof and his wife, Trudy.
   Outside the airport, a blue van was decorated with 10 colorful
balloons and signs saying, ``Welcome Home, Scott and Marge'' and
``Peoria Welcomes Scott.''
   Residents of Peoria _ strangers and friends _ helped the family
raise the ransom by holding bake sales and collecting donations.
   Among the Peorians welcoming the Heimdals back home was Ruby
Curless, who said she didn't know the family personally.
   Carrying a handpainted wooded sign saying, `` ``God hears our
prayers,'' Ms. Curless said members of her church, Grace
Presbyterian, have ``really been praying for Scott.''
   ``We don't know him, but it's wonderful he's coming home,'' said
Jo Frederick. ``You never know when it could happen to you and your
family.''
   A community get-together is planned for Saturday afternoon in
Peoria to celebrate Heimdal's freedom, according to his sister,
Angela.
   In Miami, Heimdal recounted how he was kidnapped April 28 in
northeastern Ecuador.
   ``We were going down river in a 30-foot Indian dugout canoe when
three men attacked us. They killed the driver, wounded the other
guy and took me hostage. They were looking to kidnap a North
American,'' Heimdal said.
   Heimdal said he initially feared for his life. He said he was
often moved among remote jungle locations along the Colombian
border and guarded by up to 25 guerillas.
   But, ``as time went on it was obvious they had no intention of
harming me,'' Heimdal said. ``Their mission was only to grab me and
take me to where no one could find me ... I was always treated with
great respect.''
   The kidnappers initially demanded $612,000 from his employer,
the small gold-mining company Iminco.
   Mrs. Heimdal said the captors had demanded just $60,000 from the
family, despite reports that the amount raised would fall short of
that demanded.
   ``It was strictly to finance their war against the Colombian
government,'' Heimdal said.
   Heimdal's parents went to Quito, Ecuador, on June 18 and took
over negotiations after Iminco did not pay any ransom and failed to
win his release. An intermediary who asked not to be identified
delivered the cash and escorted Heimdal away from the rebels on
Friday, Mrs. Heimdal said.
   Heimdal has been in seclusion with his family since then.
   Mrs. Heimdal said she wasn't bitter toward the U.S. government
even though the State Department took no active role in winning her
son's release. ``I respect the government's stand on ransoms,'' she
said.
   Heimdal said the first thing he would do on arriving home in
Peoria is get a haircut.
   And he said he will return to Ecuador.
   ``I do plan to return. I have some idea of what I want to do,''
he said. ``It won't be mining on the Colombian border.''
   However, if his mother has her say, he won't be going anywhere
soon.
   ``I've aged about 100 years after doing this,'' she said. ``I
pray to God no other mother has to go through it _ and I wish to
God they'd get those other hostages out of Lebanon.''
   His father, Roy, stayed behind in Ecuador temporarily.

   Seventeen centuries after teaching the
world how to make love, India is re-learning its own lesson.
   The rise of a Westernized middle class has brought a sexual
revolution, and formerly taboo subjects are coming into the open.
   Movies, books, singles magazines and hospitals treat sex with a
clarity that rivals the world's best how-to sex manual, India's own
Kama Sutra from the 3rd century.
   In June, a doctor published India's first study of orgasm.
Bombay Friend, the country's first magazine for homosexuals, began
publishing in May.
   Late in 1989, a psychoanalyst brought out the first book on
Indian sexuality. India's only singles magazine, which publishes
twice a year, began a monthly supplement in June.
   Even the conservative rural population is not immune. A survey
in June indicated condom sales in the countryside rose 200 percent
between 1985 and 1989. Doctors say an increasing number of farmers
seek treatment for sexual problems.
   Movies, a repository of India's vivid fantasy life, are
exploring a woman's sexual needs for the first time.
   Rape scenes, previously a must for a successful movie, are less
frequent and Indian leading men are starting to woo women instead
of yanking their pony tails like latter-day cavemen.
   In a movie called ``Truth,'' a woman even makes the first move,
unbuttoning her lover's shirt. Sunday magazine called that a
cinematic first for India.
   In ``My Husband Belongs To Me,'' a woman accused of being a
man's mistress defies society by moving into his house.
   On the darker side, AIDS is believed to be spreading rapidly.
Studies of Bombay prostitutes indicate the number testing positive
for the AIDS virus has jumped 500 percent in three years to about
10,000.
   ``We are undergoing a revolution in consciousness,'' said Sudhir
Kakar, the psychoanalyst who wrote ``Intimate Relations,'' the
first study of Indian sexuality. ``Right now, we are at the talking
phase.''
   Most of India's 880 million people still live by Hindu
tradition, which puts the extended family above the individual. Sex
takes a back seat to harmony, and the central family relationship
is not wife to husband but mother-in-law to wife.
   About 90 percent of Indian marriages are arranged, and sexual
affairs, when they occur, often happen within the family. According
to a 1984 study at a New Delhi hospital, half the men in a group of
1,000 had their first sexual experience with the wife of an elder
brother.
   Sexual taboos remain so strong in many Hindu communities that
women often do not have a word for their genitals, Kakar wrote in
``Intimate Relations.'' Women commonly refer to sex as ``working.''
   He said many Indian men believe ejaculation is a sign of
weakness and that women, by nature, are impure or wild beings.
   In India, Kakar said in the study, sex has become ``a zone of
genital combat'' where men's fantasies are filled with fear and
dread and women's longings weighed down with anger and
disappointment.
   Change is under way.
   Teen-age dating was almost unheard of in the 1970s. Now, coffee
shops and restaurants in major cities fill with couples when night
falls.
   A survey of 2,800 people last year by the Illustrated Weekly,
one of India's most popular magazines, found about 85 percent of
students aged 16 to 25 approved of ``mixing freely'' with the
opposite sex. The figure for people over 25 was 70 percent.
   Even virginity, a foundation of Hinduism's concept of marriage,
has taken a beating. Experts say almost every man insisted his
bride be a virgin 20 years ago, but only slightly more than half of
several thousand students questioned recently listed is as a
requirement.
   ``We are in the midst of great change,'' said Prakash Kothari,
India's foremost sexologist and author of ``Orgasm: New
Dimensions,'' India's first book on the subject.
   ``Women are now standing up for their rights to be sexually
satisfied,'' he said. ``It's just begun. I would never even have
dreamed of that 18 years ago when I started my practice.''
   Husbands are becoming more cooperative, he said by telephone
from his office in Bombay. ``They are making efforts to satisfy
their wives. That, I think, is a first.''
   Indians approach the idea of sexual revolution with a certain
irony. This is the country, after all, that produced the lush
eroticism of the Kama Sutra and the unihibited physical celebration
of the Khajuraho temple carvings.
   ``In some ways it is simply a process of remembering long-silent
traditions,'' Kothari said. ``We have to engage in an excavation of
our subconscious.''
   The change appears to be coming more from the West than from
India's past. Years of relatively strong economic growth have
created a middle class, estimated at about 150 million, that looks
to the West for inspiration.
   India's new yuppies exude self-confidence and a willingness to
experiment with new lifestyles.
   ``We are a broad-minded Moslem couple,'' says an ad soliciting
``adventurous couples and ladies'' in the singles magazine,
Bombayite. ``There is no word `No' in our vocabulary.''

   A ventilation-system failure was
blamed today for a stampede in a packed pedestrian tunnel linking
this holy city with a tent city. Diplomats said about 1,400
pilgrims suffocated or were trampled to death.
   Sources said a power failure caused the air conditioning in the
1,500-foot-long, 60-foot-wide tunnel to switch off in 112-degree
heat on Monday, setting off the stampede.
   ``It was God's will, which is above everything,'' King Fahd said
of the disaster. ``It was fate.''
   The disaster occurred during the hajj, the world's largest
religious gathering, which draws about 2 million Moslems.
Observances had largely ended, and pilgrims were observing
post-hajj rituals or preparing to leave.

may be improved to sharp, crisp pictures through the same computer
process that cleaned up photos taken by the Voyager spacecraft.
   Lennard Fisk, chief scientist for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, said Monday that scientists are studying the
possibility of using computer-enhancing techniques to remove the
focusing flaw from star pictures taken by the Hubble.
   ``You are all going to be delighted with the kind of results
that the telescope produces in the next few years,'' despite a
manufacturing flaw that causes star light gathered by the
telescopes two main mirrors to be out of focus, Fisk said.
   NASA engineers, meanwhile, stepped up tests designed to find and
isolate a hydrogen leak that has grounded the nation's three space
shuttles.

   Nelson Mandela raised more than $7 million for
the African National Congress in his eight-city U.S. tour, and
Americans paid millions more involuntarily _ in tax dollars for his
police protection.
   While no total for donations was available from national
organizers of the 11-day trip that ended Saturday, spokesmen in
each city had rough counts as of Monday. Many said money still was
coming in.
   Similarly, no sum of government costs for Mandela's protection
was available. In New York City alone, municipal expenses were put
at $2.6 million. Another big spender was the U.S. State Department,
which oversaw security.
   ``There isn't even the remotest guess yet'' as to the federal
expense, said Frank Matthews, spokesman for the State Department's
Bureau of Diplomatic Services. ``It's big, but I don't know how
big.''

   Scott Heimdal got a hero's welcome in his
hometown from friends and strangers who helped raise the $60,000
ransom his South American kidnappers demanded for the release of
the American gold miner.
   ``It's a great feeling'' to be home, said Heimdal, 27, upon
arriving in this western Illinois city. Except for a celebration
Saturday, Heimdal said his only plans for this week were to ``take
it easy.''
   Wearing an ``I Love Peoria'' T-shirt, Heimdal stepped off a
plane late Monday with his mother, Marge, who had flown to Ecuador
June 18 to negotiate his release after the Colombian guerrillas
refused to free him even though they had been given the money.
   Heimdal had been working as a miner in Ecuador when he was
kidnapped April 28 near the Colombian border.

<HEAD>Panamanians Want Documents Held by U.S. in Noriega Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALINA GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virtually none of the money Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega allegedly made from corruption and drugs has
been recovered and the United States is partly to blame, Panamanian
investigators say.
   A major problem, according to the investigators, is that
Washington will not turn over more than 15,000 boxes of documents
captured by American soldiers in the December invasion that ousted
the dictator.
   Noriega is jailed in Miami on federal drug charges.
   Panamanians say they need the booty to help an economy damaged
by years of corruption and an economic embargo the United States
imposed in hopes of forcing Noriega to leave peacefully.
   ``For Panamanian justice to be adequate, quick and effective, we
need to examine the documents and computer systems captured by
American troops because they contain records of the management of
property and public funds by former members of the defunct Defense
Forces,'' a document from the national comptroller's office said.
   The documents and computers, which belonged to Noriega's
military operations, were found at the headquarters of his Special
Anti-Terrorist Unit at Fort Amador, where the United States still
controls some buildings. Both nations had soldiers at Fort Amador
before the invasion.
   Officials of the comptroller's office say the United States has
given Noriega's lawyers access to the documents, but not to the new
Panamanian government.
   Lawyers for the general deny having access and contend the
papers would show the United States sanctioned some of his
activities. They claim the U.S. government has many more documents
than it acknowledges.
   U.S. Embassy statements have said negotiators from the two
countries were seeking a way to give Panama ``appropriate access to
Noriega's documents,'' but that legal precedents must be considered.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares said Panama was using
``diplomatic channels'' in an attempt to get the documents.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said:
``As in any other case involving large quantities of evidence, we
want to ensure that the proper procedures are in place to prevent
questions about handling of the documents from arising in the
future.''
   Tillett said the United States took posession of the documents
at Panama's request.
   Eusebio Marshosky, head of the comptroller's Office of
Patrimonial Responsibility, said $25 million in assets belonging to
officials of Noriega's regime had been seized, but the only
confiscated property belonging to Noriega was a ranch near the
Costa Rican border worth about $1.5 million.
   Noriega's main residence, appraised at about $10 million, and
another near the Rio Hato military base on the Pacific coast remain
in the hands of the attorney general's office.
   Marshosky said his agency was looking at other residences that
might belong to Noriega but were hidden under corporate ownership.
He said bank accounts of Noriega's officers totaling between $50
million and $70 million had been frozen for investigation but not
seized.
   The United States estimates Noriega's wealth at about $300
million. His lawyers claim at least $11 million came from the CIA,
to which Noriega supplied information for years, and intelligence
agencies of other nations.
   Noriega and at least seven of his officers have been charged
with looting the treasury. Marshosky said the delay acts in favor
of people who eventually will stand trial in Panama.
   He quoted the State Department as saying much of its information
about Noriega came from third countries and the United States
cannot give Panama the information without permission from those
countries.
   ``Noriega's fortune does not have only one origin,'' Marshosky
said. ``It came from crimes against the national wealth, drug
trafficking, money laundering, arms deals and influence peddling.''
   The dictator moved his money from place to place, making it
difficult to determine where it came from, he said.
   If Panama wants to retrieve funds from abroad, it will have to
prove the money came from a specific source, such as trafficking,
Marshosky said.
   ``The case is complicated,'' he said. ``We have problems with
evidence, problems with the searches for funds and problems with
conflicts of jurisdictions. ``Panama is being denied evidence and
lacks the money to build an effort to get the information it
needs.''

<HEAD>Tony Bennett Sings for President Bush, Meets ``The Simpsons''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tony Bennett logged two disparate credits this
year. The first was singing for President Bush. The second was
singing a parody of ``New York, New York'' for a future episode of
``The Simpsons.''
   His Bush appearance, taped in March, was at a benefit for the
Ford Theater in Washington. The 90-minute show is being broadcast
tonight at 8:05 p.m. EDT by Ted Turner's TBS Superstation.
   His ``Simpsons'' visit, recorded in May and to be shown next
fall on the Fox network, was a first for Bennett.
   But singing for presidents is old hat for him. Bennett, 63, has
done it for every president going back to Harry S. Truman.
   It's usually been enjoyable for both sides, he says. However,
there was one occasion of unease at the White House when he was to
sing at a function held by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
   The honored guest was the prime minister of Japan. A White House
aide called Bennett's then-pianist and longtime friend, Tony
Tamburello, to ask if the singer knew any Japanese songs.
   Sure, said Tamburello.
   (It must be noted at this point that Tamburello has a different
kind of mind. But this is to be expected from someone who used to
room with Rodney Dangerfield and once owned a music company called
Horrible Records.)
   ``The White House guy asks for the words to the song I was to
sing,'' Bennett recalls. ``So Tony says, `Goodby, Mama, I'm off to
Yokohama, to fight for the red, white and blue...'''
   The aide was old enough to recall that this was a World War II
song that spoke of bringing the Japanese to their knees.
   ``There was silence on the other end,'' Bennett said. ``Finally,
they said, `He's not going to sing that, is he?'''
   He wasn't, and didn't.
   The republic survived. So did Bennett, who now is in his 40th
year in show business, even though he persists in singing popular
song classics by guys like George Gerswhin, Cole Porter, Irving
Berlin and Johnny Mercer.
   Their music has been enjoying a revival in recent years, thanks
in part to such younger folk as Harry Connick Jr. and Michael
Feinstein, and such fortysomething delegates as Carly Simon and
Linda Ronstadt.
   Bennett approves of all this, with some qualifications.
   Their versions of American popular classics may not have the
style or phrasing of a Nat King Cole or an Ella Fitzgerald, he
says, ``but it's still good that they're doing it. ... It's always
going to be going on, and that music is permanent.''
   Bennett last year recorded his 92nd album, ``Astoria: A Portrait
of the Artist,'' a collection of songs loosely pegged to the idea
of kid growing up in the Astoria section of Queens, N.Y. _ where he
grew up.
   He now is helping Columbia Records put together an 80-song
compact disc collection of songs he did in his 23 years with
Columbia.
   He never thought his career would last as long as it has. He
never doubted his abilities. But he recalls a time in the '60s,
when rock music roared in, that he wasn't quite sure about how to
face the far-louder competition:
   ``I asked Count Basie, `What do you think I should do?' And he
just looked up at me with those big eyes and said, `Why change an
apple?'''

<HEAD>No Potential Series Hits Next Season, Ad Agency Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite decreasing network audiences, no network
executives have yet impaled themselves on a ratings point. Indeed,
they are so optimistic that they've got 33 new series coming up
next season.
   But hello, what's this? Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, one of
the nation's largest advertising agencies, doesn't rate any of the
newcomers as a potential hit. This does not mean it is Bummer Time,
though.
   Saatchi's annual forecast rates nine new series as having a
``very good'' chance of success, including NBC's ``Fresh Prince of
Bel Air,'' which will test whether rap music can work in a sitcom
set in Bel Air.
   (Bel Air, a wealthy enclave in Los Angeles, is largely populated
by Hollywood folk. Most are Brooklyn natives who always wanted to
play tennis.)
   ``NBC seems to have caught the rap wave while it's still high,''
says the Saatchi analysis in regard to ``Fresh Prince.''
   Saatchi does not exactly do The Wave for Steven Bochco's ``Cop
Rock,'' though. An innovative ABC series, the show juxtaposes
big-city police work with songs and musical production numbers.
   It may well be much more than just a show where police warn a
suspect, ``Anything you sing can and will be used against you .. .''
   Indeed, Saatchi says the show's dramatic scenes are as
hard-hitting as anything ever seen on TV. But the musical numbers,
at best, ``are amusing'' and at worst, ``can be distracting and
irritating,'' its analysis says.
   It declares ``Cop Rock'' a ``maybe.''
   Two CBS series get the lowest mark of ``long shot.'' They are
``The Flash,'' about a police scientist made speedy by a lab
accident, and ``The Green Machine,'' about what you'd call an
environmental A-Team.
   NBC's ``Signs of Life,'' a ``reality'' series about medical case
histories from the patients' points of view, also gets a ``long
shot'' judgment. ``It's painfully uncomfortable to watch,'' Saatchi
says.
   But there'll be a dire need in Hollywood next season for live
studio audiences who will laugh at anything, even a sitcom taped
right in front of them. This is because 18 of next season's 33 new
shows are sitcoms.
   In fact, says the study, new and returning comedies will
represent 29 percent of the combined schedules of CBS, NBC, ABC and
Fox Broadcasting, up 2 percent from the halcyon season of 1989-90.
   NBC, which has a total of 17 new and returning sitcoms on its
roster, is seeking the most laughs. Saatchi's study says NBC's
sitcom roster represents 36 percent of that network's schedule _
the highest percentage of any network.
   But dramas, as they call hour-long series, are momentarily in
decline at the networks. Because of their ``disappointing
performance'' in ratings last season, Saatchi says, cutbacks have
been made.
   Dramas will account for 38 percent of the networks' schedules
next season, compared to 45 percent in 1989-90.
   How does Saatchi handicap this fall's network ratings joust?
   NBC, the prime-time winner for five seasons, will remain in
first place, but its margin of victory over ABC in household
ratings will be half that of the fall of 1989, the agency's study
says.
   Second-place ABC will continue to make inroads, ``especially
among younger viewers, where the network will be ahead of NBC,''
the study says.
   CBS _ whose executives grouse about reporters who precede the
initials CBS with the phrase ``still mired in third'' _ will find
itself still mired in third.
   But it ``will hold onto its young audience via new comedies,''
the study says.
   And upstart Fox Broadcasting, by expanding to a
five-night-a-week schedule this fall, ``will forfeit its
extraordinary growth patterns of recent seasons, but should still
hold its youthful viewers.''

   VENI, VIDI, VIDEO: CBS, which no doubt wishes it had ABC's

20, the show is ``Wish You Were Here,'' starring Lew Schneider. He
plays a guy who, after his girlfriend breaks up with him, gives up
his Wall Street job to see the world live on tape.
   THOUGHT FOR TODAY: There is no television advertising in
Holland, Switzerland and West Germany on Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays, according to a new two-volume study entitled ``TV
Advertising on European Networks.''

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The day a stranger forced his way into
Nancy Ziegenmeyer's car, cursing her for being white and savagely
assaulting her, was just the first of two events that changed her
life.
   The second came eight months later, on July 11, 1989, when she
decided to tell the story of her rape to the Des Moines Register,
one of the nation's largest newspapers, and to do it without the
cloak of anonymity.
   Few women have opened the doors to their private hell in such a
public way. And the response _ invitations to speak, requests for
interviews from journalists the world over _ has been
overwhelmingly positive.
   ``The response tells me society is ready to deal with this
crime,'' she said. ``I think society is saying, `Yes, we're ready
to learn. Teach us.' ''
   Mrs. Ziegenmeyer came forward because of a column written by
Register Editor Geneva Overholser, exploring the refusal of her
newspaper and others to identify rape victims. The purpose, she
wrote, was to protect victims from new pain, but it instead
unwittingly re-enforces the canard that somehow the victim is at
fault.
   ``A troubling consequence of our reluctance to talk about rape
is that we rarely confront it directly,'' she wrote. ``We shy away
from thinking about rape. We shy away from its victims.
   ``As long as rape is deemed unspeakable _ and is therefore not
fully honest and honestly spoken of _ the public outrage will be
muted as well.''
   Mrs. Ziegenmeyer called the paper and agreed to be interviewed
at length for stories, on the condition they not appear before the
man accused in the crime, Bobby Lee Smith, came to trial. Smith was
convicted of first-degree kidnapping and sentenced to life in
prison with no chance for parole.
   The series by reporter Jane Schorer ran this year, from late
February through early March. It started with the rape, including
spare but graphic details of what happened that early Saturday
morning in November 1988, and continued with Mrs. Ziegenmeyer's
frustrating attempts to deal with her family, the trial and
everyday life.
   ``I think it was the dreary dailyness of her story that made it
so powerful,'' Ms. Overholser said.
   ``We knew it would be a powerful story in Iowa, but we had no
idea it would be in such demand nationwide,'' the editor said.
Media people indulged in a ``feeding frenzy'' to share the story
and get reaction, she said.
   Mrs. Ziegenmeyer wasn't the first small-town woman who was raped
when she visited the city, and she wasn't the first to tell her
story by name.
   ``I've decided that timing is everything,'' the editor said.
``This seems to be the season for the issue.'' In New York, for
example, there was some disagreement over whether to report the
name of a woman who was raped by a gang of youths while jogging in
Central Park.
   Mrs. Ziegenmeyer feels her story touched so many because it is
not her's alone: ``It's the story of thousands of other women
across the country.''
   ``My single intent when I worked with Geneva and Jane was to
help other victims and help society understand that this is a crime
of violence, just short of murder,'' said Mrs. Ziegenmeyer in a
telephone interview from her home in Grinnell, about 40 miles east
of Des Moines.
   ``The only difference is that the rapist leaves the victims
alive.''
   The interviews were cathartic, she said, but not essential for
her recovery.
   ``A great amount of healing had already taken place before the
story was published,'' she said. ``I remember the first time I
laughed, one of those laughs were you laugh until you cry. It felt
like a ton of bricks were lifted off my shoulder. I thought, `My
God, I'm human. I can do something other than cry.'
   ``After that I began to heal,'' she said.
   She and Ms. Overholser emphasized that her decision to come
forward was not a recommendation for other victims. The editor said
the paper would continue its policy of omitting names of victims
unless they preferred otherwise.
   ``The good of this story is the realization that this can happen
to anyone,'' said Karen Muelhaupt, a rape counselor for Polk County.
   Most women already know the men who rape them, Ms. Muelhaupt
said. ``The man who jumps out of the bushes is a relatively rare
occurrence,'' she said.
   At least 80 percent of victims are assaulted by acquaintances,
she said, and almost all are raped by someone of the same race.
Mrs. Ziegenmeyer, white, was assaulted by a black stranger.
   ``The only negative letters I've gotten are a few who approach
the racial aspect of the story,'' said Mrs. Ziegenmeyer. ``I
certainly think there was a racist in my car that morning, but it
wasn't me.''
   Another stranger-rape victim, Mary Williams of Des Moines, said
Mrs. Ziegenmeyer's story ``did a lot to take away the myth that
we've all heard that somehow the rape victim brought this on.''
   But she said the story left the impression that as soon as
rapists are caught, they are out of their victims' lives forever.
Mrs. Williams said the man who assaulted her was sentenced to up to
25 years and could be released at any time. She is certain he will
try to attack again.
   In an introduction to the story, Ms. Overholser wrote that Mrs.
Ziegenmeyer's story was simply that _ one woman's story.
   ``We never say the story is representative,'' the editor said.
``All we were doing was telling a hell of a story that Nancy let us
tell with her name on it.''

<HEAD>Officials Slam Baptist Press Despite Freedom Heritage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new wrinkle has turned up in longtime Baptist
links to American freedoms, but it seems a different kind this time.
   While historians give Baptists special credit for First
Amendment guarantees of no state church and freedom of religion,
assembly, speech and press _ Southern Baptist officials have
clamped down on their own press.
   ``In essence, they're rejecting the Baptist heritage,'' said R.
Gene Puckett of Raleigh, N.C., editor of that state's
denominational weekly, the Biblical Recorder.
   Other denominational editors across the country also said last
week's order for ouster of the professionally respected news
executives of Baptist Press service aimed at controlling it for
partisan purposes.
   It ``is a blatant attempt to silence a free press'' that has
operated in the denomination for nearly half a century, said J.B.
Fowler, president of the Southern Baptist Press Association.
   He called it ``sad day'' contrary to the Baptist dedication to
freedom, adding, ``Baptists, of all great Protestant denominations,
have always been champions of religious freedom and a free press.''
   With the crackdown on the denominational news service by a now
dominant fundamentalist administration, however, editors of state
Baptist newspapers were considering alternate news-gathering means.
   Fowler of Albuquerque, N.M., editor of the Baptist New Mexican,
said editors of most of the 38 Southern Baptist state weeklies were
to meet this Saturday in Dallas to examine various possibilities.
   ``Every viable alternative will be explored by the editors to be
sure that Baptist church members continue to get the truth,'' he
said.
   In early America, Baptists had a catalytic role in securing
freedoms, including a free press. Freedom of religion itself first
was planted by Baptist Roger Williams in the colony of Rhode Island.
   When ratification of the U.S. Constitution was at stake in 1789,
needed support of Virginia Baptists came only after James Madison
assured them of speedy addition of the first 10 amendments _ the
Bill of Rights.
   ``It's ironic that Baptists, with their great contributions to
freedom, would now be trying to control the press and do away with
its freedom,'' said Jack Brymer of Jacksonville, Fla., editor of
the Baptist Witness.
   ``When people are denied access to information from which they
can discern the truth, rest assured that their other freedoms also
soon will be denied.''
   Baptist Press, which distributes daily news reports to about 400
outlets, including 38 Baptist weeklies with a combined circulation
if l.8 million, was in a semiblackout early this week.
   A main offering was the text of a statement by the Rev. Sam W.
Pace, chairman of the denomination's executive committee, about its
officers asking that Baptist Press' chief editors either resign
quietly or be dismissed.
   It was felt ``the denomination would be better served by
handling this quietly and graciously,'' Pace said, adding that
committee president Harold Bennett gave the removal notice in the
``most loving'' manner.
   However, after BP director Alvin Shackleford and news editor Dan
Martin noted that bylaws gave no authority to committee officers
alone to fire personnel, Bennett called a special meeting July 17
on the case.
   With the 77-member committee now strongly dominated by
fundamentalists, the ouster seemed a foregone conclusion.
   The fundamentalist administration insists on conformity to
recently elaborated views of the Bible by all denominational
personnel, and Baptist Press has carried forthright accounts of
conflict over that policy.
   Pace of Lawton, Okla., said ``an ever-increasing perception of
the vast majority'' of his committee was that Baptist Press has
been ``the very opposite'' of ``fair, equitable and balanced''.
   Such criticisms by fundamentalist leaders have intensified as
they achieved expanding control of the 14.9 million-member
denomination, culminating with a sweeping victory at its June
convention in New Orleans.
   However, impartial studies have found the service highly
reliable, objective and adhering to the best journalistic
standards. So concluded a panel of secular news professionals
retained six years ago to evaluate the service.
   Two years ago, the Southern Baptist Press Association conducted
another extensive examination of BP news reports and concluded they
were as fair and balanced ``as humanly possible.''
   ``Religion reporters have considered Baptist Press the best
journalistic service of any denomination,'' says John Dart of the
Los Angeles Times, president of the Religion Newswriters
Association, made up of specialists covering religion.
   Don McGregor of Jackson, Miss., editor of the state's Baptist
Record, said they ``have stuck to the ethics of journalism right
down the line.''
   Ousting them ``says that when a power group gets hold of a
denomination, they may not stop at any length to accomplish their
purposes,'' he added. ``The first thing they want to control is
means of disseminating information.''
   Bob Terry of Jefferson City, Mo., editor of Word and Way, called
the crackdown ``a bloodletting.''
   Julian Pentecost of Richmond, Va., editor of the Religious
Herald, said ``the people responsibile for what has happened want a
controlled and manipulated press.''

   The Cuba of Jorge Mas Canosa's dreams is an
economic dynamo, engorged by U.S. investment. It is a veritable
suburb of Florida. It is free.
   And who would be president of this post-Castro Cuba? Some
observers say Mas already is campaigning for the job, but the
50-year-old businessman, arguably the most powerful Cuban exile in
this country, denies it.
   ``What I'm doing is very American, dreaming with a model of a
republic. For some, it's a utopia. For me, it's a reachable
dream,'' he said.
   For 30 years, since he left Cuba as a student in 1960, Mas has
been enmeshed in the anti-Castro movement. His vehicle has been the
Cuban American National Foundation, a Washington-based think tank
and lobby.
   The foundation, supported by the Cuban American business elite,
has had wide influence on American policy _ the creation of Radio
Marti and TV Marti, government-sponsored broadcasts to Cuba; the
lifting of the ban on aid to rebels fighting Cuban troops in Angola.
   Now, convinced that communist Cuba is in its declining days, Mas
has turned the attention of his foundation to the future of a
democratic Cuba. He discounts the complaints of critics who say he
is power hungry, and premature.
   When Castro is deposed, he said, the only presidency he expects
to hold is that of his business. And planning for post-Castro Cuba
is important.
   ``The future of Cuba must be the result of serious,
well-conceived, widely discussed plans with the leading experts of
the world in each field,'' said Mas. ``After all, we can afford it.
We have the resources and the time.''
   Work commissioned on behalf of the foundation, including a
constitution and economic plan for a hypothetical Cuban government,
is to assist in the island's eventual rebuilding _ not to promote
himself, Mas said in a recent interview.
   Mas said he has enlisted economists Milton Friedman and Arthur
Laffer, along with other experts, to develop plans that would be
handed over to a transitional, post-Castro government.
   Laffer is drawing up a list of Fortune 500 companies willing to
invest in a free Cuba. Enough support could be generated through
the private sector and the international bond market so that little
U.S. aid would be needed, Mas said.
   The exiles, for the most part, expect that south Florida would
virtually become an extension of Havana and vice versa.
   Mas estimates that each of the 2 million exiles would invest at
least $3,000 in Cuba, a total contribution of some $6 billion.
Exiles also would lobby for the U.S. government to open up its
market to Cuban goods as another way of stimulating development on
the island, he said.
   ``The German miracle is going to be nothing compared to this
Cuban miracle,'' said Mas, who also was appointed by Gov. Bob
Martinez to chair a Free Cuba Commission looking at the social and
economic impact Castro's prospective overthrow would have on the
state.
   Mas doesn't doubt, for even a minute, that those in ``el
exilio'' would be welcomed in Cuba. ``We will win the people of
Cuba,'' he said.
   But others aren't so sure.
   ``It's kind of arrogant and presumptuous on the part of people
here in Miami, basking under the Florida sun and having worked in
the last 30 years under the most democratic market economy in the
globe, (to say) `This is how we're going to handle a change in
Cuba,''' said Raul Masvidal, a foundation co-founder who quit in
1985.
   Furthermore, Masvidal finds it hard to believe a transitional
Cuban government would be comfortable taking advice from ``people
who represent the extreme right of the exile community.''
   Jaime Suchlicki, director of the University of Miami's Institute
of Interamerican Studies, says there's no evidence Castro ``is
about to collapse, so I think it's somewhat premature ... although
there's no harm done in preparing and looking at the options.''
   But Masvidal does see some harm in it.
   ``Of course, I would like to see Mr. Castro killed tomorrow and
thrown out of there, but I don't think it's about to happen and I
think it's very painful to be playing with the sensitivities of
families and 11 million (Cuban) people suffering every day from a
severe form of repression,'' he said.
   Mas said his critics simply are jealous of his success. His
company, Church and Tower of Florida, specializes in laying
telephone cable for Southern Bell; it has made him a millionaire.
At the same time, he built the foundation into a powerful force.
Its more than 50 directors each pay $10,000 a year to serve.
   In that high-profile position, however, Mas attracts
controversy. When Ernesto Betancourt, former director of Radio
Marti, resigned rather than accept a job transfer, he accused Mas
of trying to use Radio Marti for his own political ends and
plotting to have him removed.
   Mas, chairman of the presidential advisory board that oversees
Radio Marti, has denied the charges. The decision to transfer
Betancourt was made by the management of the U.S. Information
Agency, he said.
   When Mas joined a discussion panel that included a Soviet
delegation, hard-liners protested outside. But Mas said times had
changed; conversations with anyone _ except Castro and his brother
Raul _ are prudent when the object is peaceful change in Cuba, he
said.
   Just eight or nine years ago, Mas said, many exiles reviled him
when he said anti-Castro terrorist activities should be replaced by
political action.
   ``They felt Mas sold out to the Americans,'' said Mas. ``Now
that I talk to presidents all over, they say, `Oh, he was right.' ''
   Mas remains certain that he is right, that now is the time to
plan.
   ``My biggest dream is to make a substantial contribution to the
economic, political, moral, (and) spiritual reconstruction of
Cuba,'' Mas said, slowly and deliberately. ``I won't rest until
Cuba is free.''

<HEAD>Critics Say Disability System Puts Holes in `Social Safety Net'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cancer robbed Richard Larmore
of his ability to work, and then it took his left leg.
   That was Aug. 7, the seventh month since his application for
disability aid began wending its way through the federal paperwork
labyrinth _ and four months before he finally won approval.
   Critics say too many cases of deserving Americans take too long
to be decided by the Social Security disability system.
   Larmore, 49, was seeking Medicaid health insurance and a $449.10
monthly disability check from the Social Security Administration to
replace lost earnings from his former work as a plumbing and
heating man.
   While waiting for approval, he survived on canned goods from a
shelter for the homeless, paid his rent on $49.50 a week from the
Vermont Department of Social Welfare, and wondered how he would
meet nearly $30,000 in medical bills.
   At times, Larmore said, he gave serious thought to suicide.
   ``I thought I had about as much chance of any dream coming true
as a snowball in hell,'' he said.
   Thanks to the advocacy of a community action agency worker and a
Vermont Legal Aid lawyer, he got the benefits on his third appeal _
11 months later.
   Those familiar with the system say it can take years.
   ``You can get justice in the system as long as you've got two
years to devote to it,'' said Ted Allen, the Vermont official
responsible for a state agency that processes Social Security
claims under federal contract.
   ``Anyone who really wants disability (benefits) should continue
to appeal. And they should get a lawyer,'' Allen said.
   The disability system is complex. The nearly 1.5 million people
a year who apply for benefits under two disability programs go
first to a state-level office that reviews claims under contract
with the federal government. If the applicant is denied there
twice, he or she can pursue an appeal on two levels in the Social
Security Administration before resorting to the federal courts.
   Frank Batestelli, a spokesman at the Social Security
Administration's headquarters in Baltimore, said the nationwide
average for processing disability claims on initial application
runs from about 2{ to three months.
   Those denied can ask the state office for reconsideration.
Batestelli said he had no figures on the average length for that
stage. The average for review at the administrative law judge level
is 205 days, he said.
   ``It's not uncommon for it to take more than a year'' from the
initial application to a ruling by the administrative law judge, he
said.
   Overall, Batestelli said, more than two-thirds of disability
applicants are turned down on their initial application. More than
250,000 appeals a year go to the administrative law judge level,
where state-level rejections are reversed about 60 percent of the
time, he said.
   Critics say those reversals show the regulations set for
state-level reviewers are too tight.
   Those successful in winning help from the system get a base
federal benefit of less than $400 a month, plus an additional
amount that varies depending on other sources of income, the amount
of working time the applicant spent paying into the Social Security
system, and the number of dependents.
   The fundamental question asked by disability reviewers is
whether the person asking for benefits can continue working despite
his or her medical complaints.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found in a study released last November that 58 percent
of those people denied benefits in 1984 and still not receiving
them three years later were not working. That group's median family
income was about $6,500 in 1986, the GAO said.
   Legal Aid lawyers and other advocates for the disabled argue
that the GAO figures, coupled with the number of reversals on
appeal, show the disability system is missing many of the people it
should be serving, and they say that is due to a bias built into a
system that is trying to pinch federal pennies.
   Some Social Security administrative law judges, who review
disability cases appealed from state-level reviewers, complained
last year to a U.S. House subcommittee that they were being
pressured to deny people benefits.
   ``We have gotten allegations from administrative law judges of
coercion, threatened transfers and other kinds of pressures,'' said
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   Federal judges have criticized the agency, saying it doesn't
apply a court's ruling in one case to other, similar cases.
District and circuit court rulings abound with references to Social
Security systematically denying disability benefits to people
entitled to them.
   An agency memo cited in a disability case before a federal court
in New York issued this order to state-level reviewers: ``Do NOT
apply a court's decision on one case to other cases. If the
administration decides to adopt the decision for other claims,
revised instructions will be issued.''
   Among the most bitter and long-running legal squabbles involving
the disability system is that courts have repeatedly ruled that
substantial weight must be given to the views of doctors who have
treated a person for years when that person applies for disability
benefits.
   But lawyers with Vermont Legal Aid and their counterpart
agencies in other states say the ``treating physician rule'' is
routinely ignored when applications are reviewed at the state level.
   Vermont officials say they are compelled to follow Social
Security regulations even when they disagree with those rules.
   Allen, the state disability aid official, said he sees the
problems resulting less from concerted federal policy than from
simple bureaucratic unresponsiveness.
   ``I've always thought of the Social Security Administration as a
brontosaurus, with a real long spinal chord and slow-acting
neurons, so that it steps on you not out of malice, but because it
didn't know you were there,'' Allen said.
   ``By the time it realizes you were there,'' he said, ``you're a
grease spot.''

<HEAD>Leader of New Right Says Contest Is for Japan's Soul</HEAD>

   One of their leaders says Japanese rightists are in
a battle for the national soul, but can't win if they continue
wearing military uniforms and blaring martial music from armored
buses.
   ``I think 90 percent of the Japanese people are rightists at
heart,'' Shusuke Nomura said in an interview. ``They are just
scared off by the militarist, gangster-like image. It is time for
the right to throw away their old wartime values and become more
like the mainstream.''
   The self-styled ideologue of the new right is a dapper
55-year-old with a record of arson, hostage-taking and prison. Now,
through his books and films, Nomura seeks to lead the radical right
away from society's fringe.
   Japan's right wing has been vocal and visible throughout the
postwar era, but many people see it as an embarrassing reminder of
rule by the militarists during World War II.
   Police say many of the 840 right-wing groups are mere fronts for
gangsters involved in extortion and other non-political activities.
The number of extreme rightists in Japan is estimated at about
120,000.
   Nomura claims the support of about 1,000 people from Issui-kai
(One-Water Group) and several other large rightist organizations.
Even such limited support makes him a major figure in the rightist
movement because it is fragmented, with no central leader.
   He hopes the new right will make a serious effort to ``win back
Japan's soul.''
   ``After the war, we sold our soul to the United States,'' he
said. ``We have to grab that soul back.''
   It is ``as impossible to return to the old days of militarism as
it is to return to samurai times,'' he added.
   Nomura said the right should abandon its rabidly anti-communist
propaganda, which he said the Americans created, and work for a
more assertive, independent Japan that can ``assume a role at the
forefront'' of international politics.
   Similar ideas are gaining in other quarters and the government
is building toward greater influence in the world, in close
partnership with the United States.
   Shintaro Ishihara, a well-known conservative in mainstream
politics, has become a leader of the assertiveness movement with
his popular book, ``The Japan That Can Say No.''
   Sales of a sequel, ``Nevertheless, Japan Can Still Say No,''
have been brisk since it appeared May 22. The publisher, Kobunsha,
said 400,000 copies were in print.
   Nomura describes Ishihara and other members of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party as ``fourth rate,'' but does not favor a
government of the right.
   ``Real Japanese rightists don't seek formal power in the
government,'' he said. ``Those who do are fascists, and I disagree
with their actions.''
   Racist doctrines are not acceptable, Nomura said, and he
disagrees with the notion of Japanese superiority.
   ``Right after the end of the war, Americans suppressed Japanese
nationalism, but then they decided communism was a greater threat
and lumped rightists and gangsters together into a movement to
fight the Reds,'' he said.
   Few historians would blame America for the gangster element in
Japan's right wing, but the United States had a strong influence on
the right's postwar reformation.
   During the occupation of 1945-52, U.S. authorities first sought
to stifle militant nationalism by purging right-wing leaders from
public office and trying others as war criminals.
   Fear of rightists gave way to concerns about the left when
Japanese communists won nearly 3 million votes in the 1949
parliamentary elections and the Korean War began in 1950. A purge
of communists was declared in 1950 and the campaign against the
right ended in 1951.
   Much of Nomura's adult life has been spent in prison. His first
jail term, 12 years, was for burning down the home of a government
minister in 1963.
   Two years after his release, he forced his way into the Japan
Federation of Economic Organizations headquarters and held four
people hostage for 11 hours. He was sentenced to six years in
prison.
   ``I was young then; I wouldn't do the same thing now,'' Nomura
said, but added that he still believes violence is justified in
some situations.
   Violent attacks from the extreme right have increased.
   Hitoshi Motoshima, the Christian mayor of Nagasaki, was
seriously wounded by a rightist gunman in January. In February, a
rightist shot up the campaign office of former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   Police fear more rightist activity as Japan readies for the
coronation of Emperor Akihito in November. Reverence for the
emperor is a tenet of the right and could prompt clashes with
leftists or other anti-monarchists.
   Nomura promotes his ideas through his books and soon will
release a movie called ``Cut Him Down,'' based on an unsuccessful
military coup in February 1936.
   Like most of the ``old right,'' he favors scrapping the postwar
constitution, which the Americans wrote.
   ``The constitution is simply a law imposed upon Japan, and
although it has many good points, it isn't the product of our own
effort,'' he said. ``It is also full of contradictions, like the
banning of army, navy and air forces. We have all of those things.''
   He said the security treaty under which roughly 50,000 American
soldiers are stationed in Japan was lopsided and should be
abolished. In Nomura's opinion, ``until it is, Japan will not be an
independent nation.''
   Japan also must shed the stigma of war crimes trials that led to
the executions of many wartime leaders, including War Minister
Hideki Tojo, he said. Nomura called the trials ``victor's justice''
that left many Japanese with the idea they are criminals.
   ``I will not deny that we made many mistakes in the Great Asia
War,'' he said.
   ``Joining hands with the Nazis was a mistake. Fighting China was
a mistake. But the white man's civilization has been one of the
survival of the fittest, the strong preying on the weak. The youth
of Japan went to war thinking they were going to liberate Asia from
all that.''

   The Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, VISN,
said it has expanded its telecasts to 24 hours a day because of
widespread requests for round-the-clock programming.
   Jeffrey C. Weber, executive vice president, said the expansion,
launched July 2, adds 13 new series to the networks's schedule of
documentaries, drama, music, worship and children's programs.
   Previously, the channel TV network was on the air only 18 hours
a day.
   Started in 1988 by 23 faith groups, including Protestant, Roman
Catholic, Jewish and Eastern Orthodox, the network prohibits on-air
solicitation for donations.
   The ``network has become a driving force in showcasing
top-quality interfaith programming,'' Weber said. He said the
expanded schedule allows reaching new audiences with ``our
broad-based lineup of series and specials.''
   Among the new series are ``Heart of the Matter,'' a current
affairs report; ``Keepers of the Earth,'' an environmental
documentary series; ``Family Pictures,'' a drama series, and
``Encounter,'' interviews and profiles.

   Members of the Knights of Columbus gave
more than $92 million to charitable and benevolent activities in
1989, plus 32 million hours of volunteer service, the Roman
Catholic fraternal order reports.
   This represented an increase of a often includes
adults.
   In the old days, Zeitlin says, ``Kids didn't expect to grow up
to become famous players of marbles.'' But now graffiti artists are
hired to paint wall murals, breakdancers seek prizes in sponsored
competitions and rappers angle for recording deals.
   In a book to be published this fall entitled ``City Play,''
Zeitlin and his wife, Amanda Dargan, lament the steady move away
from ``free play'' _ the kinds of things kids do when they are
outdoors and unsupervised. Video games, they complain, ``don't
create communities. The world they create is on the screen _ in the
mind _ not on the block.''
   Video games and other manufactured amusements also demand less
invention and imagination. When parents can afford to buy toys,
their children have little need or interest in building their own
soapbox cars or making peach-pit rings by rubbing a pit against a
stoop until a hole forms in the middle.
   New York kids always have had to fight for a share of public
space, and adapt their play to the changing city.
   The paving of dirt streets and sidewalks killed marbles _ you
couldn't dig a little hole for the agate _ so kids switched to
skelly, which used a disc, such as a bottlecap, that could be
flicked into boxes marked on the smooth pavement. Similarly, when
row houses began to fill the sandlots that served as baseball
diamonds, kids started playing stickball in the streets.
   No one claims the new play, much of it indoors or under close
supervision in parks, is all bad.
   Brian Sutton-Smith, a student of children's play, argues that
the old games prepared children for an economy dependent on
physical skill and strength. The new ones, he says, train children
for an information economy that values the manipulation of signs
and symbols. Skill at a computer screen is more important than
skill with a slingshot.
   Many city kids still play in the streets, and some play
traditional games, especially in poor, crowded neighborhoods like
Bedford-Stuyvesant and the Lower East Side. Boys there have been
known to build a go-cart out of a police barricade, and girls still
like double-dutch jump rope.
   But even where vestiges of the old play endure, there is little
of the density or complexity _ the dozens of variations of
hopscotch _ the Hirschmans discovered.
   There are, of course, games of which the couple never dreamed.
   Last year, police said they had discovered a playground stand
where children operated a make-believe drug ring, offering bags of
grass clippings and sugar. They recorded drug transactions on a
ledger and scraps of paper. One read, ``Cocaine, small half-baggie,
55 cents. Small baggies, $1.''

<HEAD>Greek Orthodox Group Wants To Legislate, Not Socialize</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An impressively orchestrated series of receptions, speeches,
awards, concerts, dinners and other social events usually
characterize national conventions of the Greek Orthodox Church in
the Americas.
   But this time, something different is in the offing and it may
jar the customarily graceful protocol.
   A recently organized group of lay members plans to challenge
operations of the church's biennial Lay-Clergy Congress July 9-12
in Washington, demanding more representative participation.
   ``The laity has been pretty much regulated, controlled and
stifled and authority has become more centralized,'' said George D.
Karcazes, a Chicago attorney and president of Orthodox Christian
Laity.
   ``We want to restore the participatory process in the tradition
of our faith.''
   Such democratic-style procedures in which both clergy and laity
take part in church decision-making, including the choosing of
bishops, is part of the Eastern Orthodox heritage.
   But the lay organization says that policy has been eroded in the
orderly running of the 2 million-member U.S. church.
   Unlike the Roman Catholic systen, ``Orthodoxy has a long
tradition way back from the beginning of the church of lay
participation and democratic processes,'' Karcazes said in an
interview.
   ``But that has been eliminated. The laity has become totally
subservient and blind followers. It's a trend over the past years
with ever-increasing centralization and less lay participation.
   ``We want to energize the laity into more responsibile
involvement. It's a necessary role. We're not doing something
against the interest of the church, but are coming to its aid.''
   He said the complaint is not aimed at Archbishop Iakovos, the
widely esteemed head of the church for 30 years, but is a matter of
revising representative methods and spurring the laity into
rightful responsibilities.
   ``We love and respect him as our spiritual leader, and he's
largely in agreement with what we've proposed,'' Karcazes said of
the archbishop. ``He's a charismatic individual, with an
international reputation.
   ``But he would get more objective advice if he had elected laity
around him (instead of a mostly appointed council).''
   Iakovos, asked his view of the lay group, said ``the movement
may have some merit.'' He has met with its leaders, and said he
supported possible steps to ``improve our system.''
   He suggested that instead of a ``separate organization,'' the
group may accept assignment of questions it has raised to a special
church task force. He quoted St. Paul's advice to do everything in
orderly manner.
   The group is proposing that the Lay-Clergy Congress be comprised
of diocesan bishops and clergy and lay representatives of the 555
parishes, each bishop and lay and clergy representative having one
vote.
   At present, Karcazes said the regulations also allow retired and
auxiliary bishops to vote and also members of the Archdiocesan
Council, whose 118 lay members are appointed by the archbishop, but
automatically have votes.
   The proposal says lack of any limit on the council's size could
permit the congress of more than 1,000 delegates to ``be stacked
with appointees, thereby diluting the process.''
   Another proposed change would provide that the congress elect
its presiding officer and secretary, rather than the archbishop or
his appointee presiding and his appointing the secretary, as at
present.
   The laity organization also criticizes the large amount of time
the Congress devotes to ceremonial and social events, and the
little time given to critical issues confronting the church.
   ``Work sessions have been sandwiched between these often
irrelevant events'' and ``sometimes cancelled,'' the lay group says.
   It says that tendency may be even greater this time because of
the presence of Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios I, spiritual leader
of all the world's Eastern Orthodox Christians.
   He is spending most of July visiting in this country.
   Karcazes, whose lay group sent the patriarch a welcoming message
asking for a meeting with him, said the group has more than 2,000
members in 35 states and was started because of wide grassroots
concern.
   ``We're not a group of renegades, but of thoughtful, involved
members of the church,'' he said. ``We're simply giving voice to
what many priests and prominent lay people have been saying and
writing about for years.''
   He emphasized that the group does not question church teachings,
or the authority of bishops over doctrine and liturgy, but wants
more representative decision-making on other matters.
   ``The channels exist on paper for it but are not functioning,''
he said, adding that the lay-clergy congress has become ``largely a
spectacle'' of banquets, political speakers, ceremonies and other
``extraneous events.''
   ``It's no longer a working, deliberative conference where clergy
and laity have time enough to sit down and seriously confront the
issues facing the church today.''

   One of six education goals agreed on by
President Bush and the nation's governors was to conquer illiteracy

the third of an occasional series on those goals, shows that even a

   At first glance, or crunch, making the
better potato chip might seem a pretty low-tech pursuit.
   Mary Jones, a potato inspector at the Frito-Lay plant here for
25 years, knows otherwise.
   ``When I first started, it didn't take much to do this,'' she
said, shouting above the 90-decibel din of conveyors and frying
machines as she weeded out green or flawed spuds. ``Now you've got
to know something.''
   Such as how to read and interpret computer-generated graphs
showing whether chips are just the right thickness, down to
1-1000th of an inch.
   Or which delicate adjustments to recommend if chips are cooking
too brown, too spicy or with the wrong moisture content. Or how to
ensure that each of 3.6 million bags of potato chips, corn chips,
tortilla chips and cheese puffs made per week weighs precisely the
right amount.
   Wrong decisions, left uncorrected, can lessen profits, lose
market share, and not least, create unhappy customers.
   Whether the product is the perfect potato chip or computer chip,
U.S. employers of every stripe are finding daily reasons to worry
about the workplace skills of both new and veteran employees.
   Nearly two years ago, Frito-Lay established a basic skills
program for employees like Jones _ employees who typify the
``workplace literacy'' crisis that afflicts the nation, according
to study after study.
   Jones, 49, completed high school decades ago. She can read and
write. She is not ``illiterate.''
   But, like many other U.S. workers, she found she lacked the
math, computer and communication skills needed to thrive in an
increasingly complicated and computerized workplace _ circumstances
that were spotlighted in February, when the Bush administration and
the nation's governors set six goals to address America's education
problems.
   Among them was a vow to make every adult American literate by
the year 2000, and give all workers ``the opportunity to acquire
the knowledge and skills, from basic to highly technical, needed to
adapt to emerging new technologies, work methods, and markets.''
   U.S. companies already spend some $30 billion a year on worker
training, a recent report by the National Center on Education and
the Economy estimated.
   Companies like Eastman Kodak, Polaroid and IBM have had
state-of-the-art workplace training programs for years. Virtually
all states run workplace literacy programs. Pennsylvania, for
example, is working with local unions to help commercial drivers
pass stiffer licensing exams.
   Yet some experts worry that the nation's workplace literacy
efforts are misguided. Too often, such programs focus on boosting
basic reading or math skills, but neglect issues like computer
literacy, how to commmunicate effectively with fellow workers, how
to type, skim-read, or interpret complicated written or oral
instructions.
   ``What's happening now is that a phenomenal amount of money is
being spent, and much being wasted. Workers have been out of school
for years, but need to be trained for changes in the workplace,''
said Lawrence Mikulecky, a professor of language education at
Indiana University who has written extensively about workplace
literacy.
   ``The most effective programs relate basic skills with job
training,'' he said.
   At a class this spring at Frito-Lay's Orlando plant, workers
counted the number of big, medium and small potato chips in several
bags and graphed the results _ a simultaneous lesson in basic math
and quality control.
   Plant managers plan to expand the program this summer to include
courses in stress management, presentation skills, teamwork and
problem-solving.
   ``Five years ago, we weren't doing anything,'' said Robert
Beeby, chairman of Frito-Lay. Now, he said, five of the company's
38 plants have educational programs and more are being considered.
   ``Our whole style at Frito-Lay is pushing down responsibility.
We don't want to have to tell our workers what to do,'' Beeby said.
``Literacy skills aren't the big problem, but dealing with the
technology.''
   Some companies might be motivated by foreign competition from
Japan or elsewhere. The Orlando plant's worries are just 400 miles
away in suburban Atlanta, said plant manager Dave Nicholson.
   The plant, opened in May 1965, only recently began to acquire
the high-tech machinery and computers that many newer Frito-Lay
facilities have.
   One such plant in Perry, Ga., has state-of-the-art equipment and
a highly literate workforce. When Nicholson and other Orlando
employees visited the Perry facility, it crossed their minds that
it might someday bite into the Orlando plant's market area, which
includes northern Florida.
   As the Orlando plant modernized, managers decided to assess the
reading skills of its approximately 250 employees. Of the 70
percent who voluntarily took the assessment, about one-third were
told by letter they could benefit from the skills program.
   The plant began classes in September 1988 with the help of the
Orange County Public Schools. The district supplied teachers and
worked with managers to create curricula relating basic skills to
making potato chips.
   Some 65 employees have participated in classes thus far.
   Workers take classes in a small room at the plant two hours a
week for nine to 12 weeks, half on company time, half on their own.
They also can come in on their own from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. on Fridays
to bone up on math and other skills using any one of a dozen
computers in the classroom.
   An initial challenge was ridding workers of the fear that
managers were using the skills program to lay off weak readers.
   ``At first I was worried,'' said Ruby Jefferson, a packer for 18
years who has taken three of the workplace courses. ``I don't have
the fear I had before. A lot of people here didn't get into the
classes because of that. I'm encouraging them to do it.''
   Others had to be convinced that lessons would not be of the
``Dick and Jane'' variety, said training manager Donna Badie-Dietz.
   Readings include the employee benefits package, for example. A
writing lesson might include drawing up a maintenance work order.
   The program isn't about boosting standardized reading scores,
managers insisted. The aim is improved morale and an ability to
carry out correct decisions in complex situations without having a
manager looking over workers' shoulders.
   ``We have not set any sort of benchmark,'' Beeby said. ``We
could easily have said, `There is a portion of our workforce that
hasn't graduated high school, and let's replace them.' What we said
instead was, `Let's not cast those folks aside.' ''
   For many, there also have been payoffs outside the plant.
   ``My boys know more about this stuff than I do,'' said B.J.
Parker, a packer at the plant for 16 years who was practicing math
on a computer. ``I want to catch up with them.''

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Menem has made
the country his stage. If Argentina were a play, he would be
producer, director and star. In the first year of his presidency,
by personality as much as policy, Menem staved off hyperinflation,
social tension and the military unrest that forced his predecessor
to leave office 22 weeks early, on July 8, 1989.
   The lawyer and career politician, 60 years old last Monday,
charms, manipulates and improvises. He is blunt in one situation,
ingenious in another. His greatest assets, observers say, are
pragmatism and intuition.
   He charted a course of fiscal austerity and political tolerance
to jolt this South American nation from economic stagnation and
political confrontation. In the process, he may transform Argentina.
   ``I have never voted Peronist, but if I had to vote today, I'd
vote for him,'' said Carlos Escude, an economist, author and
university lecturer. ``He is fascinating in his strengths and
weaknesses.''
   This nation of 33 million people slid from affluence to
near-ruin in four decades.
   When Menem took over, monthly inflation was 197 percent, more
than some countries see in a generation. In a fertile land that
ships grain and beef to the world, Argentines were eating in soup
kitchens and looting grocery stores.
   Menem is the son of Syrian immigrants who once was a political
prisoner, a provincial governor with a taste for showgirls and fast
cars who seemed an unlikely savior.
   His Peronist Party's history of economic nationalism and
administrative incompetence was described as a cause of Argentina's
ills, not the cure.
   The new president quickly separated himself from traditional
Peronism. On his first day in office, Menem devalued the currency
by 54 percent and raised gasoline prices sixfold. Argentines were
appalled.
   He has acted with similar resolve since then, sometimes seeking
consensus but often going against public opinion and the counsel of
his advisers.
   In October, he pardoned military officers involved in the
``dirty war'' against leftists of 1976-83, removing a grievance
that led to three uprisings against former President Raul Alfonsin.
   Diplomatic relations with Britain resumed this year after Menem
agreed to suspend his country's claim to the Falkland Islands, over
which the two nations fought a 74-day war in 1982 that was
disastrous for Argentina.
   ``He is a man with a great virtue: he has no preconceived
ideas,'' said Maria Julia Alsogaray, a Menem appointee from a
conservative party that is anathema to traditional Peronists.
   Some of the greatest changes have been economic.
   Savings accounts worth $2 billion, about half the money in
circulation, were converted to 10-year government bonds in January
to stop speculation against the austral, Argentina's currency. The
austral has been stable for several months.
   Companies nationalized or created by dictator Juan Peron, who
founded Menem's party in the 1940s, were put up for sale.
   U.S. and Spanish investors bought the telephone company last
month and the state airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, will change
hands later this year.
   Menem halted subsidies to private companies, reduced the budget
deficit, lifted controls on exchange rates and prices, lowered
tariffs, partially deregulated the oil industry and encouraged
agricultural production.
   New private investment in energy and transportation alone is
projected to surpass $6 billion before Menem's term ends in 1995.
   Many of Menem's actions have been taken at great social cost,
for which organized labor, leftist political parties and human
rights groups revile him. Old-style Peronists call him a traitor.
   At least 40 percent of Argentina's 12.7 million workers are
unemployed or underemployed, according to Labor Department figures.
Opposition economists say inflation shrank to about 13 percent for
June only because the recession is so deep.
   Real wages for government employees have declined drastically.
Policemen, paid the equivalent of $100 a month, usually have at
least one other job and the crime rate is soaring. Teachers have
boycotted classes off and on during most of this school year.
   The middle class is declining in numbers and living standard.
The low quality of care at some public hospitals is scandalous.
Many more beggars and homeless people are on the streets, living in
doorways and abandoned buildings.
   Menem is blamed for these things and more.
   Alfonsin's Civic Radical Union, the second-largest party in
Argentina, claims he ``stacked'' the Supreme Court by increasing it
from five judges to nine and filling the new seats with Peronists.
   Newspaper editorials say his trip to Italy for the first match
in Argentina's defense of the World Cup was frivolous, that his
driving of speedboats and rally cars is reckless.
   His separation this year from his wife of 24 years, Zulema Yoma,
was treated as a soap opera. Menem didn't help by barring her from
the presidential residence; she complained loudly outside the gate.
   Whatever his problems, Menem's approval in the polls has never
dipped below 47 percent, the share of the vote he won in the May
1989 election. Sometimes it has exceeded 80 percent, and nobody
wonders who is in charge.

<HEAD>Thirst For Electrical Power Threatens Grand Canyon Environment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From the air and from
the water, the urban thirst for electricity is encroaching on one
of the great natural wonders of the world.
   Mighty as it is, the National Park Service says, the Grand
Canyon is in distress.
   About 80 miles away, a huge coal-burning power plant belches
12.5 tons of sulfur dioxide each hour because it doesn't have
pollution-grabbing scrubbers on its three skyscraper-tall
smokestacks.
   It is said to mix with Los Angeles smog _ and the Grand Canyon
suffers.
   To the northeast, Colorado River water races through turbines in
a dam during the day to meet peak demand for electricity in cities
hundreds of miles away. When the demand falls at night, the river
flow is cut, creating destructive ``tides'' downstream.
   And the Grand Canyon suffers.
   At issue is the quality of experience for visitors to one of
nature's masterpieces, and what cost utility customers might have
to pay to preserve a view or save a beach. All this comes at a time
when the Grand Canyon is hosting record crowds, which themselves
are taxing services and even raising concerns that access might
have to be limited.
   On some days, a blue haze in the canyon dulls the view and
occasionally obscures the opposite rim 10 miles away.
   The daily rise and fall of river water, sometimes spanning 13
feet, erodes beaches and harms spawning grounds.
   ``The Grand Canyon is threatened,'' said Jim Ruch, vice
president of the Grand Canyon Trust, a conservation group. ``It is
threatened by an accumulation of actions that were taken with good
intentions but with little understanding for their consequences.''
   Added former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt: ``When you can't see
across the canyon because of smog, it's as if the last symbol of
the pristine West has gone the way of Los Angeles.''
   At the center of the canyon's woes are two power plants that
generate some of the cheapest electricity in the West: the Navajo
Generating Station at the northeast end of the canyon, about 12
miles from Page, Ariz., and the 27-year-old Glen Canyon Dam near
the Utah-Arizona border.
   The battle lines already have been drawn.
   What makes this man-vs.-nature showdown unique is that the
troublesome plants aren't blamed for health problems, only for
souring the quality of experience for visitors to the Grand Canyon.
   The Environmental Protection Agency concluded last year that the
Navajo Generating Station contributes up to 70 percent of the
canyon's haze pollution, usually worst during the winter. The EPA
must decide by Feb. 1 whether to order the plant's owners to
install scrubbers to reduce emissions by 90 percent.
   Cost estimate: $500 million for the scrubbers, and $3.9 billion
to operate and maintain them over 30 years.
   If the scrubbers are ordered, it would mark the first time the
EPA took action solely to protect a view; there is no immediate
health danger from the smog at the canyon.
   A lawsuit filed in 1982 by the Environmental Defense Fund forced
the EPA to take action. After a tracer chemical placed in the
smokestack emissions at the Navajo Generating Station turned up at
monitoring stations in the canyon, the EPA issued its findings.
   ``That was enough to point the finger,'' said Polly Hays, a park
service scientist.
   But the Salt River Project, a public utility that operates the
plant for electric companies in California, Nevada, Arizona and
Utah, contends its coal-burning doesn't pollute the canyon and that
the tracer study was flawed.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan has asked the National Academy
of Sciences to evaluate the findings.
   On clear days, Grand Canyon visitors can see about as far as the
eye can see _ more than 200 miles, Hays said. But a few days a
month, usually in the winter, smog hangs in the canyon and
visibility can drop to about 30 miles.
   ``People who live in cities may think 50 miles visibility is
great, but for the Grand Canyon, it makes a big difference,'' Hays
said.
   Salt River Project officials contend the canyon's haze problem
is more a result of smog blowing out of the Los Angeles basin and
other sources. Federal officials agree, but say the Navajo
Generating Station also is a prime contributor and a part of the
problem that quickly can be fixed.
   ``SRP feels it is being unfairly singled out,'' Hays said. ``But
we have to start somewhere. ... Some people say these are sacred
areas, and if we can't protect them, then the whole world must be
falling apart.''
   The plant, one of the largest coal-fired facilities in the
country, does meet existing state and federal pollution standards
and captures more than 99 percent of its ash, SRP spokeswoman Teri
Morris said. About 300 tons of sulfur dioxide slip through each
day, however.
   ``We believe that Navajo Generating Station's contribution to
regional haze is negligible,'' she said. ``The amount of emission
is in line with the size of the plant and the amount the state and
federal regulations allow us to do.''
   On the other front, U.S. Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., has
introduced legislation to alter Bureau of Reclamation operation of
the Glen Canyon Dam to protect the canyon downstream. An
environmental impact statement is being prepared this summer.
   The Bureau of Reclamation, Miller said, ``might as well be
running hundreds of bulldozers down the canyon floor daily.''
   The park service says its surveys indicate there already are
fewer beaches in the canyon, and that there is no way to replenish
them. Some rafters have been left stranded by the swings in water
flow, which sometimes fluctuate from 3,000 to 30,000 cubic feet per
second in one day.
   ``We feel we're losing those beaches in that flushing action,''
said Grand Canyon assistant superintendent John Reed.
   Unless action is taken, he said, ``this will change the entire
experience that people have on the Colorado River, and the most
extreme change will be that those floating on the river will not be
able to stop because the beaches will be gone.''
   The Western Area Power Administration, an Energy Department
agency that sells electricity from federal projects such as dams,
opposes Miller's legislation until studies already under way
determine whether Glen Canyon dam is responsible for any beach
erosion.
   Smoothing out the dam's operation ultimately would result in
higher electric costs for customers, WAPA officials said.
   ``We are a part of the utility industry and we are always
concerned with costs to our customers,'' said deputy area manager
Ken Maxey.
   For Lujan, both issues present a dilemma because two agencies
within his department are at odds with each other. In both cases,
the National Park Service has clashed with the Bureau of
Reclamation, which is a part owner of the Navajo Generating Station
and the operator of the Glen Canyon Dam.
   The Interior secretary has yet to take a stand on either issue,
asking for more study.
   To environmentalists, the tide is shifting in their favor at the
Grand Canyon as concern over nature grows in the country.
   Babbitt, a director of the Grand Canyon Trust, used the threats
to the canyon as the focal point of a recent Democratic National
Committee fund-raising mass mailing.
   ``Ultimately, these two issues are political issues,'' the
former presidential candidate said. ``A lot of people in Arizona
and the nation are no longer willing to say, `Generate electricity
no matter what the cost.' ''

   Myrna Hillyard
remembers the moving experience of sitting alone at the Grand
Canyon and studying the beauty. But no more.
   ``It's much harder to be alone here. You can't really have that
solitary experience which is so special,'' the elementary school
principal says as she shepherds a class around the park.
   Cars orbit the parking lot in search of a space these days at
the Grand Canyon. Tourists remain on shuttle buses for fear of
losing a seat, and postpone dinner until 9 p.m. to avoid the long
restaurant lines.
   As the population in the Southwest has grown and the popularity
of Disneyland-Las Vegas-Grand Canyon tour packages has surged _
especially among foreign tourists _ the Grand Canyon National Park
now finds itself inundated with visitors, short on staff and
facilities, and searching for solutions.
   Park officials expect more than 4 million visitors this year _
33 percent more than just five years ago. The number of visitors
has grown faster than at any other national park.
   But bus service launched in 1974 in response to crowds _ then
just 2 million a year _ actually has been cut back, its funding
sliced from $1.5 million to $620,000.
   Fewer rangers are available for talks, toilets are cleaned less
often, and roadside plants end up trampled by drivers who give up
trying to find a parking space. Complaint letters are up.
   ``We're just not meeting the needs,'' said park management
assistant Chuck Lundy. ``The demands on our facilities, our
restaurants, our campgrounds, or transportation, have exceeded the
abilities of the park.''
   At issue is whether park officials may some day be forced to
limit the numbers allowed in daily to the most popular areas, to
preserve a memorable experience.
   ``It is a dilemma. We're pleased people can come and see the
Grand Canyon, but we're concerned about the quality of the
experience,'' Lundy said. ``We think the transition from what is
expected to occur into what is unacceptable has begun to occur.''
   Plans are in the works for a huge Disneyland-type parking lot
away from the park, which would be serviced by shuttle buses, Lundy
said.
   Yet while officials and some canyon protection groups fret over
the crowds, tourists say they have come to expect nothing else at
major attractions.
   ``It's still so special and so wonderful, I'd hate to see them
limit it,'' said Mrs. Hillyard, the principal from the Fort Apache
Indian Reservation.
   ``You expect lots of people, and they really haven't bothered us
much,'' Cort Lowerison of Laguna, Calif., said during a Memorial
Day weekend visit. ``We just eat in the off hours to avoid waiting
in line.''

   Forget Gary Hart and Donna Rice _ you don't
always need a politician and the other woman to titillate the
imagination. Sometimes what goes on between a lawmaker and his WIFE
is just as interesting.
   And no less than the Library of Congress is offering a peep
through the keyhole.
   From September to March, the library will display some of the
most personal mail that ever traveled between members of Congress
and their wives over the last 200 years.
   Yes, there was sex in Washington in the nation's formative
years. It's described by Rep. Job Pierson, D-N.Y., to his wife,
Clarissa, on Dec. 17, 1834.
   It seems Mrs. Pierson's brother, a U.S. senator, seduced a maid
the first week of her employment and ``cohabitated with her during
the whole session.''
   ``The other boarders were angry at this monopoly,'' Pierson
wrote. ``They enticed some four or five girls from a house of
ill-fame ... who came there every night'' until the landladies
``ordered the servants to bar the doors against their admission.''
   Other letters radiate laughter, sadness, courage, love,
poignancy, fear and that old bromide that a gal stands by her man.
There is only one woman _ the late Rep. Clare Booth Luce, R-Conn. _
among the lawmakers featured in the exhibit, which is part of the
library's bicentennial celebration of Congress.
   The letters discuss:
   _The role of women. ``Always be sunshine and flowers,'' Pierson
counseled Clarissa on Feb. 12, 1833, but never worry about ``the
price of wheat'' because ``such matters should be provided and
regulated by the other sex.''
   _Spousal wit. ``Mark my magnanimity,'' Elizabeth Woodbury wrote
her Jacksonian Democrat husband, Sen. Levi Woodbury of New
Hampshire, on Jan. 3, 1830. ``I here invest you with a
carte-blanche, to bow to, to smile upon, or to flatter any lady you
please, without doing penance for it on paper....''
   _Spousal support. ``You have rendered the world the greatest
service ... you have used the power and opportunity ... for
humanity and democracy,'' Belle Case La Follette wrote Sen. Robert
M. La Follette, R-Wis., on March 5, 1917. It was the eve of
America's entry into World War I and La Follette had just fought
bitterly, under tremendous pressure, against President Wilson's
proposal to arm U.S. merchant ships.
   _Society ladies. Sen. Woodbury writing to Elizabeth on Dec. 19,
1829 that Miss Silsbee was ``flat as a pancake.'' Mrs. Munroe
resembled ``the elephant _ her step an earthquake and her breath a
storm.'' And Mrs. Polk? ``Thin as a hatchet and grown almost
positively ugly.''
   _The congressional pay raise of 1873. It was ``pushed through
the Senate during the final night using all sorts of parliamentary
tricks,'' according to Sen. Carl Schurz, R-Mo. He wrote his wife,
Margarethe, on March 5, 1873, ``The entire operation was so
shameless....''
   _Unflattering views of Congress by those who served. ``We dayly
go to the Capitol at about eleven o'clock, do little or nothing and
return at about three o'clock to dine,'' Sen. Simeon Olcott wrote
wife Tryphena, back in New Hampshire, on New Year's Day 1802.
Twenty-two years later Andrew Jackson, then a Democratic senator
from Tennessee, wrote his wife, Rachel, ``I am truly wearied with
lounging here; doing nothing, but feeding on the public funds.''
   John J. McDonough, a manuscript historian at the library, said
the exhibit will attempt to ``bring in the personal, more intimate
aspect'' of lawmakers' lives into public view.
   Most of the letters were written when members ``didn't bring
their wives to Washington,'' said Marvin Kranz, an American history
specialist.
   As the Civil War approached on Dec. 7, 1860, Whig Rep. Justin
Smith Morrill informed his wife, Ruth, ``I am put on the great
committee to save the Union but I do not think it can be saved and
I shall on Monday decline to serve....''
   The war was underway when Electa Dawes wrote Rep. Henry L. Dawes
of Massachusetts, on July 25, 1861, that ``right will prevail'' and
``the colored man will have rights which will be recognized and
respected.''
   Four years later, on April 16, 1965, Dawes wrote his wife that
he had attempted to call on President Lincoln two nights earlier,
but ``found he had gone to the theater.''
   The news of the assassination arrived just as Dawes arrived home
and he wrote, sadly, ``I am at a funeral and the nation are
mourners.''

<HEAD>Bob Barker Host of Long-Running Game Show `Price Is Right'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 18 years on CBS' ``The Price is Right,''
television's longest-running network game show, Bob Barker figures
he's given away $90 million in prizes to 30,000 contestants.
   But he hasn't felt the urge to switch sides, to join the
contestants who try to guess the price of the prizes without
guessing too high.
   ``I know nothing about prices,'' he said. ``Once a writer
interviewing me brought a paper bag full of items, and I couldn't
get any of the prices. He said I was on the right side of the
microphone.''
   Still, Barker understands the show's attraction: ``Everyone can
identify with prices, even the president of the United States.
Viewers at home become involved because they all have an opinion on
the bids.''
   Sometimes, it seems like ``The Price Is Right'' has been popular
since the start of recorded history. The show began taping its 19th
season on May 23, passing the previous champ, ``What's My Line?''
It became a daytime show on CBS in 1972 and expanded to an hour in
1975, and ran briefly in prime time in 1986.
   Of course, this is merely the most recent incarnation, which
also ran briefly in prime time on CBS in 1986. In a different
format, the show ran from 1956-1965 in prime time, first on NBC and
then on ABC, with Bill Cullen as the host. Syndicated versions also
ran during the 1970s and 1980s.
   A few things have changed in the time Barker has been associated
with the show. The prices, for example. In 18 years, the tags on
the automobiles have gone from four digits to $44,000 and more.
   The tanned, white-haired Barker has been associated with two of
the noisiest and most energetic game shows. Before ``Price,'' he
spent 18 years as host of ``Truth or Consequences,'' first on NBC
and then in syndication.
   ```Truth or Consequences' was a stunt show, so it was energetic
by its own nature,'' Barker said. ```The Price Is Right' has been
described as an extravaganza. People know they're going to be part
of a carnival. They never know if they're going to be a contestant
until their name is called. One of the producers interviews
everyone and picks the ones he think will make the best
contestants. But the names are kept secret until the show starts.''
   Barker worked in radio until Ralph Edwards heard him and asked
him to audition as the host of ``Truth or Consequences.''
   ``Ralph and I meet every year at 12:05 p.m. on Dec. 21 to
celebrate,'' he said. ``He hired me at that time in 1956. We have
lunch and drink a toast to our many years together. When we started
it was live in New York at 11 o'clock in the morning. That meant I
had to do it here at eight o'clock.
   ``The sign at the El Capitan Theater was `Free Donuts and Bob
Barker.' After four weeks on the job I got a firm contract and top
billing over the doughnuts.''
   Barker also spent 20 years as host of the ``Miss USA Pageant''
and the ``Miss Universe Pageant.'' Barker, an animal-rights
activist, departed over the presentation of fur coats to the
winners. He said the pageants no longer award fur coats and have
asked him to return. No dice.
   ``They publicize zoos and rodeos, both of which I oppose,'' he
said.
   Fun facts about Bob Barker:
   _He has a red-belt in karate, which is just below a black belt.
``My first karate teacher was Chuck Norris. I met him when he came
on `Truth or Consequences.' He'd come to my house and kick me all
over the garage. Then he would go to his acting classes. I guess it
worked out.''
   _Many people find it hard to believe that Barker is his real
name, because in a sense he is a barker for the show. They insist
his name is Baker.
   ``So many people called me Mr. Baker that I bought a basset
hound and named him Mr. Baker,'' he said. ``If anybody calls my
house and asks to speak to speak to Mr. Baker, I put the dog on.''

<TEXT>
   At the very center of ``Die Hard,'' a thriller sleeper from
1988, was the hero's sheer reliance on his wits and jury-rigged
defenses. There were well-developed characters, a strong human
factor and a pronounced battle of wits, as directed by John
McTiernan, who succeeded so well with ``The Hunt for Red October.''
   In Renny Harlin's sequel, maverick cop John McClane (Bruce
Willis) dissolves into a wisecracking James Bond, and high tech
subs for imagination.
   But die-hard ``Die Hard'' fans needn't be too alarmed. ``Die
Hard 2'' is filled with mouth-drying thrills and heart-stopping
chills, high-speed chases on snowmobiles, plane crashes, sprayed
bullets, rib-crushing fights and lots of blood.
   The action is played out at what filmmakers want us to think is
Dulles International Airport outside of Washington, D.C. Only
problem, it doesn't look like Dulles and the filmmakers stupidly
allow a closeup of a pay phone to reveal ``Pacific Bell.'' Very
sloppy. And since the movie was filmed at the Alpena, Mich.,
airport and in Denver and Washington State, all the more reason to
pay attention to details.
   Once again, it's Christmas and McClane is waiting for his wife's
plane to land so they can spend the holiday together with her
folks. McClane, ever the eagle-eyed cop, notices some pretty
suspicious guys milling about the airport carrying suspicious
looking packages. He sees one go to a restricted area and follows.
   A gun fight follows, one of the terrorists is killed and the
airport is quickly propelled into a nightmare. But McClane is the
only one aroused enoug to suspect more than holiday hanky-panky.
   A group of mercenaries, out to protect ``our way of life,'' as
their leader proclaims, has unleashed a string of horrors in order
to abduct and spirit to safety a South American drug baron who is
being brought to the United States to stand trial.
   The terrorists set up shop near the airport, tap into the
control tower and assume command of runways and communication with
air-borne planes that are battling their way through a fierce snow
storm.
   Here we find another interesting lapse on the part of the
filmmakers. The control tower immediately gives in to the
terrorists and never once thinks to contact National Airport
(spitting distance from Dulles) or Baltimore International Airport
and have their control towers pick up the flights on their radar.
   What this does is to dilute a sense of urgency and strain
already strained credibility.
   McClane bumps heads with an idiot airport security chief,
finally teams with Army special forces honchos, led unconvincingly
by John Amos, and races to a boiling climax.
   Along the way, Steven de Souza and Doug Richardson provide some
spirited and fun dialogue, especially for Willis. When the agent at
a rent-a-car counter allows him to use their Fax machine so he can
send the fingerprints of the dead terrorist to his pal, Al
(Reginald Veljohnson) in LAPD, she asks him out for date. His
snappy reply as he flashes his wedding ring: ``Sorry, just the Fax,
Miss.''
   There's also some nice caustic repartee on the plane between
Holly McClane (Bonnie Bedelia) and the bozo TV reporter who almost
got the McClane family killed in ``Die Hard.'' Yes, Thornberg is
back for ``the big scoop,'' and William Atherton is his smarmiest.
   Also back for a cameo is Veljohnson with his Twinkies. His
relationship with McClane played so heavily and so well in the
original; unfortunately, it's been written out in the sequel.
   Tom Bower does well as Marvin, a wacko janitor who sneaks
McClane around the airport, and Fred Dalton Thompson plays it
straight as the airport chief, Trudeau.
   There is too much reliance in ``Die Hard 2'' on gimmicks and
gadgets and characters from central casting, such as the terrorist
leader who works out naked _ muscles primed _ before going off to
the mission. McClane does use his resourcefulness _ and it seems
neverending. Just as the guy comes up for air, he goes under again
and comes back even stronger.
   But where McClane found himself in a crazed situation by
accident in ``Die Hard,'' he's superhero by choice in ``Die Hard
2.'' This, somehow, makes it very different and lessens the
sympathy or empathy we might have for him.
   There are loads of laughs _ even when unintended by the
filmmakers, lots of raw, macho action and a few surprises in this
Gordon Company-Silver Pictures Production. And a lot of people
probably won't want to fly again once they learn about ``the outer
perimeter'' and that great parking lot in the sky.
   Produced by Lawrence Gordon, Joel Silver and Charles Gordon,
``Die Hard 2'' is rated R for violence, including an icicle
impalement and language.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When the founders of Rykodisc formed the
small recording label in 1984, they took the name from the Japanese
word ``ryko,'' meaning ``sound from a flash of light.''
   The name reflects the company's niche as a label specializing in
compact discs, which use lasers to play distortion-free digital
recordings.
   The company borrowed more than its name from the Orient.
Rykodisc's slogan is ``we're only in it for the music,'' and the
owners stress quality over quantity.
   That philosophy has made the company a minor power in the music
industry, attracting artists such as David Bowie and Frank Zappa.
   In an era of giant music conglomerates and generic packaging,
Rykodisc may be the wave of the future.
   ``We use our size to our advantage,'' said Don Rose, 35, one of
the founders and partners in the company. ``People ask us how we
can compete with the major labels and we tell them we don't
compete. We're in a position to make a bigger splash on a smaller
scale.''
   Rykodisc specializes in re-releasing significant titles and
digitally remastering them when possible, adding extra tracks and
elaborate packaging. The eclectic label includes rock music,
so-called World music (King Sunny Ade, Hamza El Din), reggae, folk
and jazz.
   The company is expected to gross $20 million in sales this year,
up from $4 million in 1987.
   Rykodisc began as a CD-only label and rode the success of CDs.
Business boomed, and it now issues cassette tapes and LPs.
   The company's two biggest coups came when it acquired the
lucrative compact disc rights to the back catalogs of Frank Zappa
and David Bowie. Rykodisc proposed deluxe re-issues on CD of their
past hits, which their own record companies had neglected to do.
   After two years, Zappa agreed to go with Rykodisc. Since then,
more than 20 Zappa CDs have been issued, selling more than 1
million units and resulting in Zappa's first Grammy and first
international tour in years.
   The company signed Bowie last year, after months of
negotiations. Rykodisc's release of ``Changesbowie,'' an update of
Bowie's original greatest hits collection, was its first title to
go gold.
   ``It was a fantastic opportunity for us,'' said Rose, a
soft-spoken yet intense man whose office includes piles of CDs,
cassettes, a digital audio tape recorder, DAT tapes, a television
and VCR. ``Bowie's stature as a innovator is really second to
none.''
   In overflowing offices that overlook Salem Harbor, Rose oversees
a staff of 15, most of whom are in their late 20s and early 30s.
The atmosphere of the company's headquarters is quiet and casual.
The walls are decorated with music posters and CD boxes.
   ``We view ourselves as music fans and our product comes from the
fan@collector point of view,'' said Rose.
   Rose has telephone conferences daily with his three partners
based in Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Los Angeles.
   He has been working in the music industry since the age of 18,
when he bought the first of several record stores in the Midwest.
After moving to Boston's North Shore in 1979, he formed a small
label called Eat Records.
   Rykodisc hopes to acquire the back catalogs of other established
artists. It also has signed new talent, like Australia's Screaming
Tribesmen, in the hope of finding a breakthrough smash group that
can make a record company.
   Rykodisc also founded the pro-environment ``Ban the Box''
movement calling for elimination of the elaborate, 10-inch-long
boxes CDs are sold in. Rose said the U.S. is the only country to
package CDs that way, primarily to discourage shoplifters and allow
retailers to use their old LP shelves. The ``Ban the Box'' movement
advocates the sale of CDs in their small cover boxes.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forstmann Little &amp; Co. plans to buy cable
television equipment maker General Instrument Corp. for $1.6
billion in the latest sign of a mild resurgence in corporate
buyouts.
   The takeover business has been languishing in recent months
largely due to lack of interst in junk bonds, the high-yield and
high-risk securities sold to finance many of the deals of the
1980s. Several recent deals, however, have been announced by
companies drawing on their own cash or more conservative bank loans
to finance the takeovers.
   Half the money for the General Instrument buyout, announced
Monday, will come from Forstmann Little's $2.3 billion acquisition
fund, whose investors are mainly large corporate pension funds,
Theodore J. Forstmann, general partner of the investment firm,
said. The rest will will come from a group of banks led by
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., he said.
   ``Because of Forstmann Little's ability to employ a uniquely
conservative capital structure, all of the companies it has
previously acquired have been able to continue to invest in their
future,'' Forstmann said in a prepared statement.
   The General Instrument buyout would be the second for Forstmann
Little this year and the 17th in its 12-year history. Since it got
into the leveraged buyout business, Forstmann Little has acquired
about $10 billion worth of companies.
   About four months ago it was a partner in the $825 million
acquisition of Chrysler Corp.'s Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.
   Forstmann said hopes to strengthen its acquisition fund this
summer, which could mean even more acquisitions later in the year.
   ``We're in an extremely strong position,'' he said.
   News of the General Instrument deal sent the company's stock
over the $44.50 per share offer price to close at $45.25, up $8.75,
in active composite New York Stock Exchange trading Monday.
Forstmann Little officials and stock market analysts said they
didn't see the runup as a sign that a competing bid might surface.
   ``I'm not sure with the drying up up of the junk bond market who
else will be able to put something like this together,'' said Jay
Samstag, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
   General Instrument has agreed to amend its shareholders' rights
plan, or ``poison pill,'' and to pay Forstmann Little $33 million
in the event that its board of directors accepts a higher bid.
   Under the terms of the merger agreement, set to expire Aug. 13,
Forstmann Little will assume or refinance General Instrument's
existing debt in addition to acquiring the outstanding common
shares.
   General Instrument Chairman Frank G. Hickey said the board was
urging shareholders to sell their stock because ``this all cash
offer provides an excellent value.''
   Forstmann said there were no immediate plans to reorganize
management or sell any portions of General Instrument.
   Forstman said his firm was particularly attracted to General
Instrument's Broadband Communications division, which provided 60
percent of the company's revenue last year.
   General Instrument's products include cable TV subscriber
terminals, cable and scrambling equipment.
   The company ``has a very strong dominant core business with both
reasonably predictable cash flow and growth potential,'' Forstmann
told a news conference. Forstmann said re-regulation of cable
television was likely to take place soon, and that could prove
helpful for the industry.
   General Instrument, which employs 14,200, also produces aircraft
surveillance equipment and semiconductors through its data systems

   General Instrument earned $23.2 million, or 84 cents a share, in

percent higher the previous year's quarter, largely due to gains
from the sale of discontinued operations _ the remaining portion of
a major restructuring.

<HEAD>Sells Control of U.S. Newspapers after Missing Junk-Bond Payment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the likes of Robert Campeau and Donald Trump,
add Ralph Ingersoll II.
   The publisher, like the developers, built an empire with
high-yield junk bonds and got into trouble when the massive
interest payments started to catch up with him.
   On Monday, Ingersoll agreed to trade his U.S. interests and
their troublesome debt burden to his investment partners. He gets
control of a smaller group of European newspapers.
   Ingersoll said the deal was driven by a desire to get more
involved in European publishing.
   But bankers and investors with knowledge of Ingersoll's business
said the publisher's buying spree of daily and weekly newspapers
left him with too much debt to weather the nationwide slump in
advertising revenue.
   ``He has an unworkable balance sheet,'' said James Rubin, an
analyst at M.D. Sass Investors Services, a New York investment
firm. M.D. Sass successfully urged bondholders to reject
Ingersoll's bid to work out his debt troubles this spring.
   Ingersoll is relinquishing his stake in three companies that
publish dozens of daily and weekly newspapers _ including the New
Haven Register and the Trentonian of Trenton, N.J. _ to the New
York investment firm E.M. Warburg, Pincus &amp; Co. The two had been
joint owners, although Ingersoll had voting control.
   Warburg, Pincus gains full control of Ingersoll Newspapers Inc.,
which publishes nine dailies and 53 weeklies; New Haven Acquisition
Co., publisher of the Register; and Community Newspapers Inc.,
which has newspapers in Ohio and on New York's Long Island.
   Ingersoll will gain control of a group of British and Irish
newspapers that he controlled jointly with Warburg, Pincus.
   The announcement came as Community Newspapers said it would not
make a July 1 interest payment on its $125 million in 13 percent
junk bonds. Ingersoll had been trying for months to buy back the
bonds at a steep discount to alleviate his debt burden.
   A banker involved in the buyback negotiations said the deal
might not help bondholders because Warburg, Pincus isn't obliged to
cover Community Newspapers' debts, and has said it won't.
   If no payment is made in 30 days, bondholders can force the
company into involuntary bankruptcy.
   Warburg officials did not return repeated calls for comment. In
a statement announcing the deal, chairman and chief executive
Lionel Pincus said only that he hoped Community Newspapers would be
able to work out its problems with bondholders.
   In a telephone interview, Ingersoll said the three U.S.
companies were on track to make $100 million in profits before
taxes and interest this year on revenue of $400 million.
   ``We are having a record year despite the economy,'' he said.
   The companies could have serviced their debt if not for the
collapse of the junk bond market, which hit bonds like Community
Newspapers' especially hard, Ingersoll said.
   The company issued its bonds in 1987 with a relatively low
interest rate by promising to set a new rate this year that would
guarantee the bonds would trade at 101 cents on the dollar.
   The bonds were quoted at about 50 cents on the dollar on Monday,
down about 9 cents. To push the price up to 101 cents suggests the
company would have to pay a new interest rate of near 30 percent.
   That burden ``would choke any company,'' he said.
   Community Newspapers said Monday it would not reset the interest
rate on July 7, as it was scheduled to do.
   The announcement comes a little more than two months after
Ingersoll folded the St. Louis Sun, a new tabloid that he hoped
would revolutionize the slumping newspaper market by using new
technology and marketing strategies.
   The British and Irish newspapers Ingersoll is gaining have
combined circulations exceeding 1 million and annual revenue of
$178 million.
   Europe offers great opportunities because of the planned
dropping of trade barriers in Western Europe and the spread of
free-market economics in the East, Ingersoll said.
   ``The new Europe will grow very, very quickly,'' he said. ``It's
the new frontier.''
   Ingersoll said he planned to expand onto the European continent
in 1991, probably in Italy.
   He also said he wasn't giving up on the United States and
planned to start or acquire a magazine here in 1991.

<HEAD>Lotus Files Copyright Infringement Suits Against Two Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp. has filed
copyright infringement lawsuits involving its popular 1-2-3
software against two California companies.
   The suits come after success with a similar suit against another
firm last week.
   In the actions filed Monday, Lotus charges that software
marketed by Borland International Inc. of Scotts Valley, Calif.,
and the Santa Cruz Operation Inc., of Santa Cruz, Calif., violate
Lotus' copyrights on keyboard commands and on-screen images.
   The products named in the suits are Quattro and Quattro Pro from
Borland International and SCO professional from SCO.
   Borland filed suit in U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif.,
on Friday seeking declaratory relief, according to Borland
spokesman Dick O'Donnell. O'Donnell said the suit seeks
confirmation that Quattro and Quattro Pro do not infringe on the
copyrights of Lotus.
   A U.S. District Court judge ruled Thursday that copyright
protection on the 1-2-3 software extends beyond the computer
program's inner workings to keyboard commands and on-screen images.
   Both Paperback Software International and subcontractor
Stephenson Software Ltd., the defendants in the case, said they
would appeal last week's decision.

<HEAD>Possible $19 Million Payback for Victims of Insider Scam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal securities regulators have unveiled
their plan to distribute $19 million to alleged victims of what the
Securities and Exchange Commission charges was a massive 1988
insider trading scheme.
   The SEC filed a proposed plan in a New York court Monday for
distributing the money allegedly obtained in what at the time was
the second-largest insider trading case in U.S. history.
   Fred C. Lee agreed to pay the money, but neither admitted nor
denied any wrongdoing to settle a civil suit brought by the SEC.
   In 1988, the SEC accused Lee, a Taiwanese national living in
Hong Kong, and Stephen K. Wang, a junior analyst in the mergers
department at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., of engaging in a $19 million
insider trading scheme.
   At the time the charges were filed, the case was second only to
the $100 million settlement of disgraced stock speculator Ivan F.
Boesky. Both have since been eclipsed by the settlements of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. and junk bond financier Michael Milken.
   Wang, who was 24 at the time, pleaded guilty in September 1988
to one count each of securities, wire and mail fraud for taking
about $200,000 to funnel confidential information to Lee about at
least 25 takeover deals that Morgan Stanley was handling. There was
no allegation of wrongdoing by Morgan Stanley, which suspended and
later fired Wang. Wang was sentenced to eight months in prison.
   Although he agreed to settle civil charges with the SEC, Lee has
not answered a criminal indictment stemming from the SEC
investigation.
   As part of his settlement last August, Lee agreed to pay $19
million into a fund to reimburse investors defrauded by the scheme.
He also agreed to pay the government $1.5 million in fines and $4.5
million in back taxes with interest.
   As of April 16, the receivership fund, plus accrued interest,
totaled $20.3 million, according to the SEC.
   In papers filed at federal court in Manhattan, the SEC proposed
reimbursing investors who sold securities in 18 different companies
on the same day the defendants bought those securities.
   The trades in question took place between July 1987 and April
1988.
   The SEC proposal is subject to a federal judge's approval.
   Securities of the following companies were involved: Utah Power
&amp; Light Co., Manpower Inc., Savannah Electric &amp; Power, IC
Industries Inc., E.F. Hutton Group, Outboard Marine Corp.,
Chi-Chi's, Richmond Hill Savings Bank, Catalyst Energy Corp., E-II
Holdings Inc., Stanadyne Inc., American Standard, Federated
Department Stores, Stop &amp; Shop Cos. Inc., Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber
Co., Sabine Corp. and Staley Continental Inc.
   Editor's Note: Those wishing to comment or object to the plan
should write the court-appointed receiver, Margaret A. Bancroft, at
the Manhattan law firm of Dechert Price &amp; Rhoads or the the SEC's
chief litigation counsel, Thomas C. Newkirk, at 450 Fifth Street,
N.W. Stop 4-2, Washington, D.C. 20549.

<HEAD>SEC Seeks 2nd Delay in Multiple Listing of Options</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the nation's five options trading
exchanges say they will comply with federal securities regulators'
request for another delay in plans to list stock options on more
than one exchange.
   It was the second delay requested by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which last January asked the exchanges to voluntarilly
hold off on multiple listings until June 30.
   A stock option is a contract giving the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a certain security at a specified price
by a certain date. Options are traded on stocks listed on exchanges
or traded over-the-counter via computer.
   Unlike stocks, options provide no voting rights in running a
company or dividends _ only the potential to profit from the
stock's price movement.
   Traditionally, an option could be listed at only one exchange.
But under multiple listing, all the options exchanges could deal in
any option.
   In a letter to the five options exchanges, SEC Chairman Richard
C. Breeden asked them to hold off until Oct. 1 on listing options
that are already being traded on another exchange.
   The SEC hopes the exchanges can come up with a joint plan for
linking the exchanges electronically by Sept. 21, Breeden said.
   Last week, Breeden said the SEC has the authority by law to
order the exchanges to accept any linkage system, but the agency
prefers to have the exchanges develop the system.
   The June 29 letter to the heads of the Chicago Board of Options
Exchange and the American, New York, Pacific and Philadelphia stock
exchanges was disclosed Monday by the SEC.
   Officials at the Philadelphia, American, New York and Pacific
stock exchanges said they would honor Breeden's request.
   But the Chicago Board of Options said it would be
``inappropriate'' to comment publicly before informing the SEC of
its stance.
   Until January, most options on stocks listed on an exchange were
traded exclusively in one marketplace. The privelege for trading a
specific option was assigned to an exchange by lottery _ a system
the exchanges favored but the SEC felt was uncompetitive.
   But a rule passed by the SEC last year to ensure customers would
get the best possible price abolished the limitations on multiple
trading of options. All new options, those listed for trading after
January, can be traded on any options exchange.
   Last week Breeden said a system linking the exchanges was
feasible and that four of the five exchanges had agreed to operate
a system called PIPE, for Public Investor Privileged Express. The
Philadelphia Stock Exchange supports a different system: the
Auction Intermarket System, which is similar in most instances but
has the added factor of time priority.
   If more than one exchange shows the same price for an option,
the Philadelphia system would send the order to the exchange that
posted that price first. The PIPE version would allow the exchange
where the order was first directed to match that price.
   ``We've suggested a compromise to the other exchanges and the
SEC,'' said Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia
exchange.
   Under the plan, the PIPE system could be used as long as it
lists only post Jan. 22 stock options and can evolve into a
time-price system.
   Giordano said that if PIPE turns out to be more competitive than
the Auction Intermarket System, the Philadelphia excahange will go
along with the others.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Stocks Also Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen today
after a sharp two-day fall, and share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange also rose moderately.
   The dollar closed at 151.68 yen, up 0.28 yen from Monday's
151.40-yen close. It opened trading at 151.35 yen and ranged
between 151.32 yen and 152.12 yen.
   The dollar had fallen a total of 3.02 yen in the previous two
trading days, and closed in New York on Monday at 150.90 yen.
   It recovered somewhat today on market players buying dollars to
cover short positions, said Masato Hayashi, chief customer dealer
for the Bank of Tokyo.
   In general, ``these days, the dollar is declining day by day,''
Hayashi said. It started down after closing at 155.62 yen on Monday
last week.
   He said the yen has been helped by rumors that the Bank of Japan
was considering raising the official discount rate, the interest it
charges on loans to commercial banks. Higher interest rates tend to
make a country's currency more attractive.
   ``For the rest of the week, the dollar will fluctuate within a
narrow range,'' he said, adding that the release of U.S.
unemployment figures on Friday will set the trend for next week's
trading.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues rose 254.37 points, or 0.79 percent, closing at 32,414.60.
The index had gained 219.99 points on Monday.
   Estimated volume for first section stocks was 450 million shares.
   The yen's recent strength, rising interest rates and arbitrage
program trading all contributed to the Nikkei's climb on Monday and
today, said Toshiaki Kakimoto, general manager of the economics
department at Sumitomo Bank.
   A massive increase in Japan's public works budget over the next
10 years, agreed on in trade talks with the United States last
week, will have a long-term impact, said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader
for Daiwa Securities. ``The effect will last about a month,'' he
said.
   Investors have been buying shares in construction, machinery and
high-technology companies.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose slightly from Monday's close of
86.53 to 86.64 by 5 p.m. The yield stood at 7.265 percent, down
slightly from Monday's 7.290 percent.

<HEAD>Chrysler Execs Get Stock Options</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp., struggling with an
erosion of its executives, has granted some top managers stock
options to keep their compensation packages competitive, a company
spokesman says.
   The nation's No. 3 automaker granted the options last week to
about 1,800 executives.
   ``People were moving on because their package was
noncompetitive,'' spokesman Lee Sechler said Monday.
   Since May 1, Gerald Greenwald has quit as Chrysler's vice
chairman and Michael Hammes has resigned as vice president for
international operations. Vice President and Treasurer Frederick
Zuckerman is expected to leave later this summer and Chrysler
Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell is expected to take early
retirement at the end of the year.
   Chrysler also is amid a $1.5 billion cost-cutting program that
has resulted in at least 2,500 salaried employees retiring early or
leaving the company.
   Company officials declined to reveal the number of options
granted or their price. Chrysler stock closed Monday at $15.50,
down 25 cents.
   The United Auto Workers union criticized granting the options.
   ``This violates the spirit of camaraderie and the sharing effort
that they've been talking about,'' said Aaron Taylor, president of
UAW Local 7, which represents laid-off workers at the company's
closed Jefferson Avenue assembly plant.
   ``When the company is in a downward spiraling mode, they're
still rewarding executives,'' he said. ``It leaves a bad taste in
the workers' mouths.''
   Chrysler and the UAW begin national contract negotiations July
20 to replace an agreement that expires Sept. 14.

   Campbell Soup Co. says it has sold its Juice
Bowl Products Inc. because it no longer fit in with the soup
company's plans for improving its performance.
   Campbell announced Monday that Juice Bowl was sold to ABA
Holding Inc. of Cranbury for an undisclosed amount. ABA Holding
plans to retain the Juice Bowl name, plant and staff, Campbell said
in a statement.
   ABA Holding is the U.S. arm of Looza NV, a Belgian fruit juice
company.
   Juice Bowl is one of several businesses Campbell has put on the
block as the food company tries to improve its sluggish performance
by focusing on its more profitable businesses.
   Campbell put Juice Bowl up for sale in January after acquiring
the Lakeland, Fla.-based fruit juice operation in 1982. It
generated annual sales of about $60 million.
   Last week, Campbell put its U.S. and Canadian fresh foods and
fresh produce businesses up for sale. The companies have annual
sales of more than $300 million and employ about 3,000 workers
worldwide.

<TEXT>
   In a preview of who might be running The
Coca-Cola Co. in a few years, the soft drink giant has given some
of its rising executive stars new jobs.
   Coke also announced Monday that its president and chief
operating officer, Donald R. Keough, will remain in his job until
fall 1993, two years beyond the company's customary retirement age
of 65. This decision had been announced to Coca-Cola management
about two months ago and ``was widely known within the company,''
said spokesman Randy Donaldson.
   The company said M. Douglas Ivester would become president of
Coca-Cola USA, the soft drink maker's U.S. operation. Ivester, 43,
has been with Coke since 1979 and has been president of the
company's European Community Group since June 1989.
   He succeeds Ira C. Herbert as president of Coca-Cola USA.
Herbert will continue as executive vice president of Coke and will
have corporate responsibility for Coca-Cola USA as well as the
company's Canadian subsidiary.
   The company also announced that John Hunter, currently a senior
vice president at Coke and president of the company's Pacific
Group, will be given additional responsibilities as deputy to John
W. Georgas, who heads the International Business Sector.
   And Ralph H. Cooper, currently president of the Northwest
European Division, will succeed Ivester as president of the
European Community Group.
   The changes are effective Aug. 1.
   Industry observers said Ivester, Hunter and Cooper are among
Coke's brightest stars, and they could rise higher in the next few
years.
   ``I think that's the issue with Coke over the next five years _
who will rise to the upper echelon. Some of the very senior guys at
Coke are getting older,'' said Hugh S. Zurkuhlen, an analyst who
follows Coca-Cola for Salomon Bros. in New York.
   ``We now know with some degree of definitiveness who are the key
players for the future president and even chairman of the Coca-Cola
Co.,'' said Jesse Meyers, publisher of the industry newsletter
Beverage Digest.
   The management changes are part of the company's natural
evolution, Coke's Donaldson said.
   ``We have a very talented group of senior management, and that
gives us the latitude to make changes like this,'' he said. ``When
you have people that capable, you want to broaden their
experience.''
   Meyers said Ivester was instrumental in improving Coke's
European distribution system and has been one of the company's top
young executives.
   Ivester's European Community Group, which accounts for nearly
one-quarter of Coke's international gallon sales, recorded 11
percent gallon-sales growth last year.
   ``Any objective analysis will show you this man is on a heady
track at the Coca-Cola Co.,'' Meyers said from his office in
Greenwich, Conn. ``His financial background is excellent and now
his operational skills are excellent.''
   Hunter also has had success at Coca-Cola, Meyers said, running
various division since joining the company in 1967.
   Hunter, 52, ``is clearly marked as one of the major
international executives who in a relatively short time will be a
key corporate executive,'' Meyers said.
   Zurkuhlen said he did not expect to see any significant changes
in Coke's operations after Monday's announced changes.
   ``The company hasn't changed from an operational standpoint all
that much'' in the past decade, he said. ``The focus is on
increasing consumption of soft drinks around the world.''
   The news that Keough was sticking around until 1993 was welcome
news, said Zurkuhlen.
   ``From most people's perspective, Keough is a class act who
understands just about every aspect of the company,'' Zurkuhlen
said.

   The owners of Japanese cars were the most pleased
with the quality of their 1990 vehicles, according to a survey by
J.D. Power and Associates.
   The only U.S. nameplate in the top five of the list released
Monday was General Motors Corp.'s Buick Division, according to the
Agoura Hills, Calif., research company.
   Power said 26,000 new-vehicle owners responded to the Initial
Quality study, which looks at their evaluations of the 1990 models
after three months of ownership.
   Toyota's year-old Lexus division topped the list, with reports
of 82 problems per 100 vehicles.
   Following were Mercedes with 84, Toyota with 89, Infiniti with
99 and Buick with 113.
   In Power's model-by-model ranking, the Buick LeSabre was the
only domestic car among the 10 most trouble-free.
   This was the sixth year Power conducted the survey. It sells the
results, mostly to automakers, some of whom make use if them in
advertising.
   Power does not publicly release the full rankings of the
approximately 33 auto nameplates and more than 200 models studied,
said David E. Whiteside, publisher and editorial director.

   The stock market moved ahead in early trading
today, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average above the 2,900
mark.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which gained 18.57
points on Monday, was up another 9.65 at 2,908.91 after the first
half-hour of trading.
   Advancing issues led declining issues by a margin of about 10 to
7 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 508 up, 344 down and 588
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.38 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 17.64 million shares at the same
point in Monday's session.
   Some late computer-driven program buying and takeover
speculation were credited for Monday's gain.
   But the advance came on relatively light trading, which was
expected to persist today on the eve of Wednesday's observance of
Independence Day. The U.S. financial markets will be closed on
Wednesday.
   In early dealings this morning in the credit markets, prices of
some actively-traded 30-year bonds were down by about $1.25 for
every $1,000 face value, pushing their yields up slightly to 8.41
percent.
   Among active issues on the NYSE early today, Philip Morris was
up } at 47~, American Express was up &lsqb; at 31&rsqb; and General Electric
was up &rsqb; at 70~.
   General Instrument was up | at 45}. It agreed Monday on a buyout
at $44.50 a share by the investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.26 at 196.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

   An investor group today dropped its $700 million
offer for Talman Home Federal Savings and Loan Association,
Illinois' largest S&amp;L.
   Talman said in a statement that Chicago area banker Harrison I.
Steans, leader of the investment group, abandoned the buyout
because the S&amp;L's revised earnings projections fell below his
original expectations.
   Talman and Steans announced in May a preliminary agreement under
which the Steans group would have bought the S&amp;L for $400 million
and invested another $300 million after the acquisition to bring
Talman into compliance with federal capital standards.
   Talman, based in Chicago, has assets of $6 billion.
   Federal regulators in March ordered Talman to stop paying
dividends on its common stock until it meets new government
requirements on capital.

   Stock prices pushed ahead in quiet pre-holiday
dealings today, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average above the
2,900 mark.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which gained 18.57
points on Monday, was up another 14.11 at 2,913.37 after the first
90 minutes of trading.
   Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of about 3 to 2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 701 up, 457 down and 575
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 47.68 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street, compared with 41.61 million shares at
midmorning Monday.
   Trading was expected to be relatively light today as the U.S.
financial markets are going to be closed Wednesday in observance of
Independence Day.
   Analysts attributed the rise in stocks to seasonal readjustments
of investment portfolios at the start of the second half of the
year.
   In economic news, the Commerce Department said orders to
factories for manufactured goods rose 2.1 percent in May,
offsetting a revised 2.1 percent decline the previous month.
   But market watchers said the report had minimal impact on the
stock market as the increase had been widely expected.
   They said traders are more interested in the employment figures
for June which are to be released on Friday. The monthly reports on
employment give the markets their first official glimpse of
economic activity in the preceding month and often contain
information that affects stock and bond prices.
   Stock prices were rising despite a decline in the bond market
this monting. Prices of some actively-traded 30-year bonds were
down by about $2 for every $1,000 face value, pushing their yields
up slightly to 8.42 percent.
   The government bond market was expected to end trading several
hours earlier than normal to give traders a head start on the
holiday.
   Among active issues on the NYSE early today, Philip Morris was
up } at 47~, American Express was unchanged at 31\ and American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 38~.
   General Instrument was up { at 45|. It agreed Monday on a buyout

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending Monday's gains amid forecasts for hot, dry weather in the
Midwest.
   Temperatures in the 90s and above were forecast for today in the
region's western and southern areas, and the National Weather
Service predicts above-normal temperatures and normal to
below-normal rainfall in the Midwest July 8-12.
   The National Weather Service forecast prompted new speculative
buying after Monday's gains, which were sparked by several private
firms' prediction that unusually warm and dry conditions would
prevail in the nation's midsection through much of July.
   Soybean futures rose sharply Monday on concerns about the
potential for damage to soybeans in the western Corn Belt and the
Mississippi Delta region.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 6 cents higher
with July at $3.27{ a bushel; corn futures were \ cent lower to 2
cents higher with July at $2.96 a bushel; oats were \ cent to }
cent higher with July at $1.39} a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 3
cents higher with July at $6.48 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower, with pork bellies
down sharply, in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .30 cent lower to .02 cent cent higher with
August at 72.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .27
cent lower with August at 83.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .22
cent to .67 cent lower with July at 61.05 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were 1.17 cents to the permitted daily limit of 2
cents lower with July at 57.67 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed Monday while pork futures were
sharply higher.

<HEAD>Southland Proposes Stock Swap As Part Of Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, has revealed details of a proposed restructuring it
hopes will enable the company to avoid bankruptcy court.
   In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company proposed swapping one share of common stock for 10
shares of new stock issued to current bondholders through the
restructuring.
   ``We feel that would be a key point to the bondholders, who
would like to see some liquidity in the shares they receive,''
Southland spokeswoman Cecilia Norwood said.
   Southland has been staggering under debt accumulated in a $4.9
billion leveraged buyout and increased competition in the
convenience store business.
   The company already has missed $69 million in interest payments
and could be forced into bankruptcy on July 15.
   In March, the company proposed a restructuring that included a
$400 million infusion of money from Ito-Yokado Inc. and 7-Eleven
Japan Co. in exchange for 75 percent ownership of the company.
   Holders of about $1.8 billion in bonds also would new securities
worth about $550 million.
   Bondholders objected, however, in large part because the
founding Thompson family retained about 15 percent ownership in the
restructured company.
   A revised proposal was presented last month, decreasing Thompson
holdings to about 6{ percent and raising bondholders' share from
about 10 percent to about 18{ percent.
   The revision also increases interest paid on the new securities
and shortens the maturities.
   Monday's filing details how the new bonds and common stock would
be parceled out to current bondholders.
   Southland said it did not begin negotiations with the
bondholders until Monday but believes an agreement will be reached
by the July 15 deadline.
   The restructuring must be approved by holders of 95 percent of
the value of the bonds and other creditors.
   ``Over the next 10 days, there will be a lot of discussions, and
I think's we'll reach an agreement,'' said John Gordon, chairman of
the bondholders' steering committee.
   But David Glatstein, president of a Dallas investment firm that
owns some of the Southland bonds, disagreed. ``I don't know a
bondholder who's willing to accept this deal. This thing is going
to bankruptcy court. The only thing that'll keep it out is if the
company decides to make its interest payments.''

   The U.S. dollar fell Tuesday against most major
currencies as interest among European traders shifted to the
British pound.
   Gold prices were sharply higher.
   Dealers said the dollar's fall was driven by strong movement
into British pounds following widespread speculation that the pound
would soon enter the European Monetary System's exchange rate
mechanism.
   Sterling rose against the dollar to levels last seen in February
1989.
   The latest interest in the pound was prompted by a statement
Monday by Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German Bundesbank,
during a speech at London's Institute of Economic Affairs.
   Poehl was reported as saying he expected Britain's entry into
the mechanism soon.
   The word appeared in an advance version of the speech released
to the press, although Poehl chose to delete the time reference in
his address. Instead, he said the timing of Britain's entry would
be ``the decision of the British government.''
   Michael James, head of corporate dealing at Midland Bank, said:
``There have been attempts to take profit (in sterling) a few times
today. It hasn't worked. It looks like sterling still wants to go
higher.''
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7800 from $1.7635 late
Monday. In New York, sterling was quoted at $1.7794 at midday.
   James said he expects the dollar to trade within a narrow range
until after Friday's release of U.S. employment data, the next key
indicator for the currency.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 151.68 Japanese yen from
151.40 yen at Monday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 151.15
yen, and in New York, it was quoted at 151.16 yen at midday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.6509 West German marks, down from 1.6580;
1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030; 5.5400 French francs, down
from 5.5635; 1.8578 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8650; 1,210.50
Italian lire, down from 1,217.00; and 1.1622 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1616.
   In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6505 West German marks,
1.3905 Swiss francs, 1,209.50 Italian lire, and 1.16265 Canadian
dollars at midday.
   Gold traders said covering short positions ahead of Wednesday's
Independence Day holiday in the United States pushed the precious
metal higher.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $361.75 a troy ounce,
up from $357.55 late Monday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $361, up from $357.80
late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 15 cents to close at a bid
$358.54.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $4.96 a
troy ounce, up from $4.95 bid late Monday.

<HEAD>Northwest Exploring Possibility of Buying Eastern</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred Checchi
has requested a meeting with the International Association of
Machinists to discuss the possibility of Northwest buying Eastern
Airlines, a union spokesman said today.
   ``Everything is just exploratory at this point,'' said Jim
Conley, a spokesman for the machinists union in Washington.
   Officials at Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest would not comment on
whether Eastern is a possible takeover target. Checchi repeatedly
has made public his intention to expand the carrier, possibly by
buying an entire airline or parts of one.
   Two weeks ago, Checchi made his most direct public comments on
the issue. ``It's fair to say we have our eyes open and maybe our
mouths a little bit open as we see what opportunities are there,''
Checchi said June 20 at a news conference announcing Frederick B.
Rentschler as Northwest's new chief executive officer.
   He declined to identify possible targets.
   Conley said machinists union officials met Monday in Washington
to discuss the problems of integrating the Eastern employees into
the Northwest operation. He said the meeting was a prelude to a
meeting with Checchi, but said he does not know when that meeting
will take place.
   ``There probably won't be an announcement'' on when the meeting
will occur, he said.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said the possibility of merging
with Northwest has come up before and noted Eastern employees
received a ``briefing note'' in late June.
   He said the employees were told: ``Eastern's desire is to create
a successful, independent airline, but it's impossible to rule out
a merger or buyout.''
   The employees were told in the memo that Pan Am and Northwestern
had shown interest, but meetings and discussions would not indicate
an imminent takeover. Matell said he did not know of any Machinists
meetings with Northwestern.
   The leader of the machinists' union at Eastern, Frank Ortis,
said a Northwest-Eastern merger ``would be a great marriage.
   ``It's speculation. But in our opinion, it would be a great
merger and a great buy,'' said Ortis, president of IAM Local 702.
``Northwest is a great airline. Mr. Checchi appears to be very good
with public relations and labor relations. All of the people I've
talked to, IAM people at Northwest, really think highly of Mr.
Checchi.''
   The machinists union is the largest union at both Northwest and
Eastern, representing 20,000 workers at Northwest and 8,500 at
Eastern. Northwest is the nation's fourth largest domestic carrier
and Eastern is No. 7.
   Machinists at Eastern went on strike March 4, 1989, in a pay
dispute. Pilots honored the strike but called off their sympathy
strike last November, as did flight attendants. The work stoppage
last year was followed by a bankruptcy filing, and a
court-appointed trustee took over in April.
   Ortis said machinists would go back to work ``with open arms''
if a settlement could be negotiated with the trustee, Martin
Shugrue, or with Northwest.
   ``We're ready to go back to work,'' Ortis said.

   London stocks recovered ground late in the session
to finish little changed on London's Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   The market opened stronger, on general buying enthusiasm led by
rumors of a few large buy orders. The main index, the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100-index, peaked at midmorning, rising 9
points.
   But the momentum could not be sustained, given the light trading
conditions, and the index showed a decline of 5.9 points at its low
at midafternoon.
   An improvement on Wall Street, coupled with a modest surge in
volume, boosted the index late in the session.
   One dealer noted an absence of corporate features and economic
data to provide trading incentive. ``It has been desperately
quiet,'' he said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-index finished 0.3 point,
or 0.01 percent, lower at 2,371.7.
   The Financial Times 30-index fell 1.9 points to close at
1,894.7. The Financial Times 500-share index dropped 0.62 point to
1,284.96 at the close.
   Volume came to 447.3 million shares, slightly better than
Monday's 310.7 million shares.

<TEXT>
   Here is an icy thought that, oddly, might make a
hot summer seem even hotter: The savings and loan bailout, which
could cost taxpayers $300 billion, may be just the tip of the
iceberg.
   If the tip is equal to a sum of that size, the single most
expensive governmental cost in peacetime, then how massive must the
bulk of the berg be?
   Conceivably, in the trillions of dollars, says economist Ronald
Utt, who points out that financial obligations of agencies
underwritten by the federal government now total $5.8 trillion.
   ``And much of that obligation is in bad shape,'' says Utt, vice
president of the U.S. Chamber Foundation, a former employee of the
White House Office of Management and Budget and a former Heritage
Foundation fellow.
   Potentially, he says, these financial obligations represent a
staggering breakdown of government. And, a growing number of
critics are saying, the lack of public information on the matter
represents a communications breakdown.
   Most people, it seems safe to say, cannot imagine that other
financial breakdowns are threatened, reasoning that if that were so
they would have heard of them. But that logic breaks as throroughly
as the communications.
   The obligations Utt refers to are spread among deposit insurance
programs, loan and pension guarantees, direct loan programs such as
those administered by the Small Business Administration, and debts
of five government enterprises.
   Utt's chilling observations are contained in a paper written for
Heritage, a conservative think tank whose opinions sometimes have
been influential in the Bush and Reagan administrations.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., says Utt, is by no
means the only federal credit program confronted with huge losses.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Housing
Administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seemed destined to
lose again in 1990. The FHA, he says, has seen the level of claims
against its shrinking reserves rise nearly three times in three
years.
   Further, he states, ``Half of the farm loans made by the Farmers
Home Administration are in default, and half of these defaulted
loans have been in that condition for more than three years.''
   On and on it goes.
   The federal government, he notes, stands behind nearly $500
million in guaranteed Veteran's Administration and FHA mortgages,
$48 billion in guaranteed student loans ...
   ``... and a host of other guarantees ranging from rural
electrification to shipbuilding loans, and from small business
disaster loans to loans for building plants to convert grain to
ethanol.''
   All together, he estimates, the contingent liability associated
with loan and deposit guarantees totaled $3.5 trillion at the end
of fiscal 1988. And other insurance programs _ flood insurance, for
instance _ add $500 million more.
   How could such massive obligations not rise to the surface and
break more forecfully into the media? How can such dangers lurk so
near and not cause more concern?
   Utt doesn't have an answer to those questions, but he does
suggest that both Congress and taxpayers played a role.
   Most lawmakers, he says, ``tried to convince Americans that the
crisis was just an isolated incident, and that the vast bulk of the
government credit programs are well-managed and pose little risk to
the taxpayer.''
   And for their part, many taxpasyers have wished this to be so.
   It isn't, says Utt, who advocates passage of an Omnibus Credit
Solvency Act ``to fundamentally restructure these many programs in
order to reduce taxpayer exposure to costly program failures.''
   Before it is too late, he adds.

<TEXT>
   Five shareholders are suing
Fleet@Norstar Financial Group Inc. for allegedly concealing the
extent of problem loans at the company's banks.
   Three lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Providence allege
that the company failed to make timely disclosure of its loan
problems, thereby artificially inflating its profits and the price
of its stock.
   The shareholders also allege Fleet did not adequately supervise
its loan officers, failed to reserve enough money to cover loan
losses and concentrated too much of its loan portfolio in
speculative commercial real estate, The Providence Journal-Bulletin
reported Tuesday.
   Fleet spokesman Charles T. Conway Jr. declined to comment on the
lawsuits, citing the bank's policy against commenting on pending
litigation.
   Fleet said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it ``intends to defend the actions vigorously.''
   Fleet's problem loans grew from $398 million on Dec. 31, 1989,
to $928 million at the end of the first quarter, resulting in the
company's first quarterly loss since 1974. Many of the loans were
shifted into the problem category as a result of a federal bank
examination.
   Each of the suits, filed April 4-6, seeks to represent all
shareholders as a class action.
   The defendants include Terrence Murray, Fleet's chairman,
president and chief executive.

of the top officials on the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.
   The legislation also reduce the number of commissioners on the
copyright panel from five to three.
   Bush signed the bills while on vacation at his summer home.
   The White House also announced the names of five Bush appointees
to the National Commission on Superconductivity.
   They are: Barbara S. Drake, an assistant to Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh; Travis P. Dungan, administrator of the Research
and Special Programs Administration in Washington; John K. Hulm,
chief scientist emeritus of Westinghouse Science and Technology
Center in Pittsburgh; Sidney L. Jones, an assistant Treasury
secretary; and John W. Lyons, director of the National Engineering
Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in
Gaithersburg, Md.

   The stock market drifted at higher levels this
afternoon in sluggish trading on the eve of the Independence Day
holiday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which gained 18.57
points on Monday, was up another 8.91 at 2,908.17 with two hours
left in the session.
   Advancing issues led decliners by a margin of about 8 to 7 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 774 up, 659 down and 499
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 96.79 million shares as of 2
p.m. on Wall Street, compared with 88.53 million shares at the same
point on Monday.
   Trading was relatively light today as the U.S. financial markets
are going to be closed Wednesday in observance of Independence Day.
   Analysts attributed the rise in stocks to seasonal readjustments
of investment portfolios along with the start of the third quarter.
   Institutional investors such as pension funds, they said, were
looking for good values among blue-chip stocks as part of mid-year
reallocations of funds.
   In economic news, the Commerce Department said orders to
factories for manufactured goods rose 2.1 percent in May,
offsetting a revised 2.1 percent decline the previous month.
   But market watchers said the report had minimal impact on the
stock market as the increase had been widely expected.
   They said traders are more interested in the employment figures
for June which are to be released on Friday. The monthly reports on
employment give the markets their first official glimpse of
economic activity in the preceding month and often contain
information that affects stock and bond prices.
   The bond market provided little direction for stocks. This
afternoon, prices of some actively-traded 30-year bonds were
unchanged while their yields held at 8.40 percent, the same as late
Monday.
   The government bond market was expected to end trading several
hours earlier than normal to give traders a head start on the
holiday.
   Among active issues on the NYSE, Philip Morris was up ~ at 48,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 38~ and American

   A Canadian oil pipeline company said
Tuesday it will seek to build a pipeline under the environmentally
sensitive waters of Puget Sound to keep tanker traffic out of the
narrow, rocky channels.
   Trans Mountain Pipe Line Co. Ltd. revived an idea rejected a
decade ago by environmentalists and the state after a bitter fight.
Friends of the Earth Director Dave Ortman said the new proposal
likely will draw the same powerful opposition.
   The announcement, made in Vancouver, British Columbia, followed
by hours the release of a regional oil-spill task force report that
recommends serious consideration of an offshore terminal and
pipeline to reduce the risk of oil spills in Puget Sound.
   Trans Mountain proposes building a $500 million offshore
terminal and connecting pipeline at Low Point, which is about 12
miles west of Port Angeles on the Olympic Peninsula. The company
said the terminal would service 350 tankers and barges annually,
allowing them to unload there instead of entering the Rosario
Strait and the Strait of Georgia.
   The terminal also could be used to load tankers with crude oil
piped from Canada. That oil currently is hauled by tanker from
Vancouver, the company said.
   A new pipeline from the terminal would connect with existing
pipelines to refineries in northern Puget Sound and also with
existing pipeline at Burlington, Wash., the company said. The
pipeline would run underwater for part of its route.
   Trans Mountain first proposed an offshore terminal near Low
Point in 1981 as part of a proposal to transport Alaska crude oil
to Midwestern states. The plan finally was killed as
environmentally unfeasible. Trans Mountain will use much of its
earlier environmental analysis to support its new endeaver,
spokesman Dick Stokes said.
   Ortman, a veteran of the earlier environmental fight, said
environmentalists would fight the new proposal, too. ``It's time to
think about not accommodating the oil industry in Puget Sound
either by pipeline or tanker,'' he said.
   But a regional task force said that given increasing traffic of
crude oil in the sound, a solid way to reduce the risk of spills
may be to move crude oil by pipeline instead of tankers.

<TEXT>
   The Du Pont Co. has begun marketing an
herbicide designed to attack weeds that destroy corn crops.
   The product, Accent, is aimed at controlling weeds that had been
impossible to curb _ shattercane, Johnson grass and rhizome Johnson
grass.
   Of the approximately 67 million acres of corn planted last year
in the United States, about 9 million acres had problems with the
weeds. Don Weir, Du Pont product manager, said Accent could help
cut down on farmers' annual corn crop losses of $223.5 million.
   Du Pont began marketing the product in the United States on
Monday. Sales had been delayed pending approval from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, which was granted Friday.
   Weir said the herbicide is also being sold in Argentina and will
be marketed in other countries.
   The herbicide is applied to corn crops after the weeds sprout,
allowing farmers to assess the extent of the weed problem before
applying the herbicide. Most other herbicides are applied to the
soil before weeds sprout.
   The United States produced about 42 percent of the world's corn
in 1989, according to the National Corn Growers Association.

   The General Electric Co. has formed a

   GE's Aircraft Engines division said it has signed a formal

production of the GE90 engine.
   GE expects the engine to be the most powerful commercial engine
ever developed. The company hopes to have the engine in use by the
middle of the decade.
   SNECMA will provide about 40 percent of the GE90 assembly and
test work, and will help design and make various parts of the
engine.
   GE and SNECMA already have a 50-50 partnership in CFM
International.
   ``The foundations upon which we and SNECMA are building this
program are solid as a rock,'' said Brian H. Rowe, senior vice
president of GE Aircraft Engines.
   Talks are being held with other companies interested in joining
the partnership, Rowe said.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as pre-holiday profit-taking
offset buying prompted by forecasts for soybean-stressing hot
weather in the Mississippi Delta region.
   Soybean futures ended mostly higher, extending slightly the
sharp gains posted Monday amid concerns about hot, dry weather that
is expected to continue in the Delta through the end of this week.
   Cooler temperatures and showers are forecast for Thursday and
Friday in the crop-intensive Midwest, though. That outlook,
contained in midday weather forecasts, helped cool speculative
buying interest in corn and soybean futures, said William
Biedermann, director of research with the commodities brokerage
Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Pressure in the wheat market stemmed from the advancing winter
wheat harvest, which was about half finished as of Sunday,
according to an Agriculture Department report.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2{ cents lower to 4 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.24 a bushel;
corn was 2\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with July at $2.94 a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to { cent higher with July at $1.39}

   Sharon Goodwin doesn't exactly get paid
to drink on the job _ just sip.
   ``There's always plenty to be tasted,'' said Goodwin, supervisor
of the sensory evaluation department at Brown-Forman Corp., one of
the nation's leading makers and wholesalers of alcoholic beverages.
   The Louisville-based company produces or markets such brands as
Bolla wines, Korbel champagne and Southern Comfort liquor.
   The company also owns Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Early
Times Old Style Kentucky Whisky, the nation's second- and
third-best selling bourbon-type whiskeys.
   Brown-Forman's sensory lab is jammed with expensive gadgets that
measure, analyze and evaluate various aspects of the spirits. But
company officials seem to agree that the human taste bud is in no
immediate danger of being replaced by a machine.
   ``Flavor has been an art over the years, and they're trying to
make a science out of it,'' said Wes Hazel, Brown-Forman's
analytical lab manager. ``They're trying to replace the tasters,
but I seriously don't think we can ever do that.''
   Daily production of Early Times and Old Forester bourbon at the
company's Louisville distillery runs about 450 55-gallon barrels.
The Jack Daniel's distillery in Lynchburg, Tenn., produces about
1,500 casks daily.
   ``We taste every day's product,'' said Dr. John E. Bujake,
Brown-Forman's vice president of research and development. ``So
there's a lot of tasting going on.''
   To ensure consistency, Goodwin's 10 expert tasters oversee the
progress of the whiskey through each stage of production. They
sample the liquor from the ``white product'' _ the pure distillate
before aging _ to the mature bourbon, which spends between three
and five years in charred, oak casks.
   A separate group of tasters in the quality control department
tests the product several times during blending and after bottling.
   Almost all of the 1,000 employees _ except machine operators _
at Brown-Forman's Louisville campus are potential tasters.
   But apparently not all of them are whiskey lovers. Goodwin has
had to use innovative ways to entice people into her tasting
booths, including raffling off china, tickets to sporting events
and even free parking spaces.
   Goodwin said it takes about three months to train someone to
rate the product. Once the tasters are trained, the company wants
to keep them ``forever,'' she said.
   But the term ``taster'' is a bit misleading.
   ``The smell is about 95 percent of what someone's going to give
you your rating on,'' she said. ``Their goal is to describe what
they're smelling.''
   To help the workers describe the aromas, the department is
working on a series of standard keywords. They range anywhere from
``Juicy Fruit'' _ for a taste resembling the chewing gum _ and
``woody'' to ``urine'' and ``cow manure.''
   The samples are 125 proof, or about 63 percent alcohol. Goodwin
said they are watered down to 20 percent alcohol for the tastings.
   Tasters aren't supposed to swallow the product, but some do, she
said. Goodwin acknowledged that she swallows some of the product,
but if she drank everything she tasted, ``I'd never make it home.''
   Goodwin said she is a bourbon drinker on her own time, but many
of the tasters don't drink outside the office.
   ``I've worked here a year and a half, and I've never gotten
drunk while I'm here,'' said Dave Dafoe, a product development
specialist and one of the expert tasters. ``I appreciate good
bourbons, but I don't enjoy them.''

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 2,000 Hungarian miners ended a
two-day strike Tuesday after some of their demands were met by the
noncommunist government, Hungarian Television reported.
   The announcement came after a delegation of the miners met with
the minister of industry and trade.
   The miners had refused to enter the pits at the Markushegy unit
of the Oroszlany mines on Monday and demanded a meeting with
government officials.
   In a statement issued by the miners' Workers' Council, a loose
leadership body, the miners said they were ``paid starvation
wages.''
   A delegation of 10 miners traveled to Budapest for talks with
Akos Peter Bod, the minister of industry and trade, the state MTI
news agency said.
   After the talks, Workers Council Chairman Ignac Czako told
Hungarian television, ``We are going back down this evening. We now
know this government is willing to listen to workers' grievances.''
   Said Bod, ``We do not want to create a precedent with this.
These conflicts ought to be solved on the local level.''
   The news report said some of the miners' demands were met,
including provisions allowing a miner to retire after 25 years of
pit work.
   The miners had demanded a 50 percent wage increase, better
benefits and changes in the tax law. They also wanted the mine's
administrative staff cut and managers to resign.
   Mihaly Barabas, mine general manager, said the average wage for
miners was $400 per month, compared with a national average salary
of $130.

<HEAD>Prices Up Slightly in Light Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose slightly Tuesday in light
pre-holiday trading.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 5-32 point, or about
$1.60 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield fell to 8.38 percent from
8.40 percent late Monday.
   Financial markets and many businesses will be closed Wednesday
in observance of the Fourth of July.
   Market participants shrugged off government announcements that a
large supply of bonds would be sold into the market. Concerns that
abundant supplies will depress prices have been on traders' minds
for weeks.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency in charge of
bailing out the savings and loan industry, said it would sell $5
billion of 30-year bonds on July 10.
   Separately, the Treasury Department said it would sell $18
billion in three-and six-month bills and $8 billion of seven-year
notes on July 11.
   Kathleen Camilli, chief economist for Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., said fears of oversupply in the market have been
``overridden by expectations that the Fed will ease.''
   No announcement was made after a meeting in Washington of the
Federal Reserve Board's open market committee, though economists
have been predicting the Fed will lower interest rates to try to
stimulate the economy.
   Traders ignored a Commerce Department report showing orders to
factories for manufactured goods rebounded 2.1 percent in May. The
figure was considered old news because it reflected economic
activity two months ago.
   By contrast, the June unemployment report, due Friday, is widely
awaited because it will furnish the first glimpse of how the
economy performed last month.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 3-32 point, intermediate maturities gained 3-32
point to 5-32 point and long-term issues rose &lsqb; point to 5-32
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.10 to 1,163.67.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills sold Monday fell to 7.94
percent as the discount slipped 3 basis points to 7.69 percent.
Yields on the new six-month bills issued Monday declined to 7.98
percent as the discount dipped 1 basis point to 7.58 percent.
Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.98 percent as the discount fell
5 basis points to 7.43 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 5-16 percent, down
slightly from 8&rsqb; percent late Monday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 91 31-32, up 5-32 point. The
average yield to maturity fell to 7.46 percent from 7.47 percent
late Monday.

finished above 2,900 since it closed at 2,901.73 on June 21 and was
the eighth highest close ever.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 828 up, 650 down and 495 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 130.05 million shares, against 130.20
million in the previous session.
   The NYSE's composite index rose 0.39 to 196.61.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 0.53
to 360.67.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended mostly lower Tuesday in quiet
pre-holiday trading, while the British pound continued to gain
strength on worldwide markets.
   Gold prices rose here and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery traded at $362.10 a troy ounce, up $3.30 from late Monday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$361 an ounce, $3.15 higher.
   Currency dealers said trading was thin on the eve of
Independence Day, when U.S. financial markets will be closed.
   They attributed the dollar's decline partly to technical factors
as well as sterling's strength.
   Demand for the British pound has increased in recent days amid
widespread speculation that the currency would enter the European
Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism.
   During a speech at London's Institute of Economic Affairs on
Monday, Karl Otto Poehl, president of the German Bundesbank, said
he expected Britain's entry into the mechanism soon.
   Sterling rose to $1.7800 from $1.7635 in London, and to $1.7765
from $1.7715 Monday in New York.
   The German mark also gained against the dollar. The dollar fell
to 1.6509 marks in Europe from 1.6580, and to 1.6505 from 1.6515
Monday in New York.
   The mark has remained firm in foreign exchange following the
monetary union in East and West Germany over the weekend.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.3965; 5.5400
French francs, down from 5.5450; 1,211.00 Italian lire, down from
1,212.75; and 1.16245 Canadian dollars, up from 1.16175.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.6509 West
German marks, down from 1.6580; 1.3930 Swiss francs, down from
1.4030; 5.5400 French francs, down from 5.5635; 1.8578 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.8650; 1,210.50 Italian lire, down from
1,217.00; and 1.1622 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1616.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar rose
to a closing 151.68 Japanese yen from 151.40 yen Monday. It was
quoted at 151.15 yen in London, and at 151.00 yen in New York, up
from 150.905.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $361.75 an ounce from
$357.55 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $361
an ounce from $357.80.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold was up 15 cents to close at a bid
$358.54 an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.919 a troy ounce, down from
$4.935. Silver rose in London to $4.96 an ounce from $4.95.

   Energy futures finished mixed Tuesday as
wholesale gasoline prices retreated after a modest advance.
   A pre-holiday atmosphere prevailed and trading activity was
subdued on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Financial markets and
many businesses will be closed Wednesday in observance of
Independence Day.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate rose
8 cents to settle at $16.80 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract
tumbled 35 cents on Monday. Contracts for later delivery of the key
U.S. crude oil were mixed.
   Brokers said continuing uncertainty over production and labor
problems in the Norwegian North Sea encouraged crude buying. A
day-old strike by Norway's oil workers ended Monday when the
government issued a back-to-work decree.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
for August delivery lost 0.59 cent, falling to 56.09 cents a gallon
after rising 0.47 cent on Monday. Later contracts posted more
moderate losses.
   Gas prices bobbed up Monday on the assumption that demand would
increase as the peak summer driving season got into full swing. The
price decline Tuesday came as brokers sold to collect profits.
   Wholesale home heating oil for August delivery fell 0.10 cent to
48.46 cents a gallon following Monday's decline of 0.06 cent. The
September through November contracts also settled lower.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract advanced to $1.525
per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.519, the level at which it had settled
on both Monday and Friday.

   Three leaders in the biotechnology industry have
formed a new company to develop products to treat chronic
inflammation disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
sclerosis and asthma.
   Icos Corp. said it had attracted $33 million in startup funds
from private investors, including Bill Gates, billionaire founder
and chairman of the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft computer
software company, who holds 10 percent of Icos' equity.
   The founders of Icos are Robert Nowinski, who helped found
Genetic Systems of Seattle, then sold it to Bristol-Meyers Co.;
chairman Christopher Henney, a founder of Immunex Corp. of Seattle;
and executive vice president and scientific director George
Rathmann, founder of California-based Amgen Corp.
   Icos was launched because ``all of us wanted to get back in the
creative process,'' and that's best done in a small company, said
Nowinski, Icos' president and chief executive.
   Icos plans to open a laboratory by late summer and build a
corporate headquarters and its own laboratory within two years.

   The nation's largest insurer of
mobile homes and recreational vehicles has abandoned its five-month
attempt to find a buyer.
   Monday's decision by Foremost Corp. of America came after FAI
Traders Insurance Co. of Australia said it was no longer interested
in buying the Grand Rapids-based company, said R. Robert Woudstra,
Foremost's chief financial officer.
   The decision does not settle who will control the company.
Several major blocks of shares may still be available to the
highest bidder.
   In December, descendants of company founder Edward J. Frey Sr.
announced they planned to sell all of their 4.5 million shares,
amounting to 37.4 percent of the company. Family members hoped to
fetch the highest possible price by selling their shares in a block.
   Shortly after that announcement, Foremost's board decided to
explore selling the entire company.
   Foremost's profits have suffered during the past year as it
struggled with losses from Hurricane Hugo, investments and from
discontinued insurance products.
   Foremost stock, which closed at $30.12{ on Monday, fell Tuesday
to close at $25.62{ in over-the-counter trading.

<HEAD>Gold's Gains Grow With S. Africa Tension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices advanced for the fifth straight day Tuesday
on New York's Commodity Exchange in light trading stimulated by
South African labor tensions and talk of buying interest from the
Middle East.
   On other commodity markets, coffee futures advanced while energy
futures, livestock and meat futures and grain and soybean futures
were mixed.
   Trading in most markets featured late position-squaring ahead of
the Independence Holiday, which tended to flatten out price changes.
   Gold futures settled $3.30 to $3.50 higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $362.10 a troy ounce and the most-active August
contract at $364.10.
   Silver futures finished 1.6 cents to 2 cents higher in New York
with July at $4.919 a troy ounce.
   The gold market continued its slow recovery from last month's
tumble below $350 an ounce, although analysts said investors remain
cautious.
   Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities, attributed some of the buying interest to labor unrest
in South Africa, where organized labor had partial success Monday
with its call for a nationwide general strike.
   Although the strike attempt had little effect on gold
production, ``the threat that there might be a more severe
disruption is a bullish factor,'' she said.
   The market also was buoyed by talk of Saudi Arabian bullion
purchases. The Saudis' recent sales of large quantities of bullion
has been a major depressant in the market.
   Coffee futures advanced on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange amid indications Brazil, the world's largest coffee
producer, might be willing to consider reinstatement of export
quotas to boost prices.
   The International Coffee Organization voted Tuesday in favor of
Brazil's request for a special July 23 meeting to discuss its
position on an international coffee agreement.
   The organization was effectively gutted of its price-control
powers a year ago, partly due to Brazil's opposition to a
continuation of export quotas.
   Coffee futures finished .15 cent to 1.85 cents higher with July
at 86 cents a pound.
   Near-term crude oil futures rose slightly on the New York
Mercantile Exchange but other energy futures slipped ahead of the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report.
   The report, released after the close, showed an unexpected
429,000-barrel increase in U.S. stocks of crude oil, which is
likely to prompt selling of futures on Thursday. Traders had
expected a 1 million-barrel drop in crude stocks.
   Gasoline supplies fell by 920,000 barrels, which was near
expectations. Distillate stocks showed a smaller-than-expected
increase of 253,000 barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 8
cents higher with August at $16.80 a barrel; heating oil was .01
cent to .14 cent lower with August at 48.46 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .59 cent lower with August at
56.09 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, led by losses of 2 cents a pound _ the
permitted daily limit _ in the pork belly market, erasing Monday's
gains.
   Live cattle settled .03 cent to .30 cent lower with August 72.77
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .05 cent higher
with August at 83.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .48 cent lower
to .40 cent higher with July at 61.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .75 cent to 2 cents lower with July at 57.67 cents a
pound.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade as pre-holiday profit-taking offset buying linked to
forecasts for soybean-stressing hot weather in the Mississippi
Delta region.
   Wheat futures finished 2 cents lower to 5 cents higher with July
at $3.23{ a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with
July at $2.94\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher
with July at $1.40 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to 5 cents
higher with July at $6.48{ a bushel.

   The stock market's best known index posted its
fifth consecutive gain on Tuesday to finish above 2,900 once again
as prices in the broader market also moved higher on the eve of the
Independence Day holiday.
   The gains came in typically sluggish pre-holiday trading,
however. The U.S. financial markets will be closed Wednesday and
many traders got a head start.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 18.57 points
on Monday, added another 12.37 to close at 2,911.63.
   It has risen in each of the past five sessions and its closing
level surpassed the 2,900 mark for the first time since it finished
at 2,901.73 on June 21. The record Dow Jones close was set June 15
at 2,935.89.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
834 up, 650 down and 503 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.05 million
shares, down from 130.20 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 161.23 million shares.
   Analysts attributed the rise in stocks to seasonal readjustments
of investment portfolios along with the start of the third quarter.
   Institutional investors such as pension funds, they said, were
looking for good values among blue-chip stocks as part of mid-year
reallocations of funds.
   ``We have some seasonal factors at work here,'' said Newton D.
Zinder, a veteran market analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton. He
cautioned against readung too much into the advance.
   But Gene Jay Seagle, a top technical market analyst at Gruntal
Financial Inc., said he was encouraged that the Dow Jones
industrials managed to stay above 2,900 without prompting
program-driven selling by professionals trying to make a profit on
price differences between stocks and stock futures.
   ``I would expect a resumption of the up move and a test of the
highs,'' he said, referring to post-holiday trading.
   The market appeared to shrug aside the Commerce Department's
report that orders to factories for manufactured goods rose 2.1
percent in May, offsetting a revised 2.1 percent decline the
previous month.
   The rise was widely expected and market watchers said traders
are more intent on employment figures for June which are to be
released on Friday. The monthly reports on employment give the
markets their first official glimpse of economic activity in the
preceding month and often contain information that affects stock
and bond prices.
   Philip Morris was the most active issue on the NYSE, rising ~ to
48.
   Several utility issues were also actively traded, evidently to
capture dividends. Central Maine Power rose &lsqb; to 18}, Entergy
gained &lsqb; to 20 and SCEcorp rose &lsqb; to 37|.
   General Instrument was up { at 45|. It agreed Monday on a buyout
at $44.50 a share by the investment firm Forstmann Little &amp; Co.
   Among blue chip stocks, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost \ to
38| and International Business Machines dropped 1&lsqb; to 117|. But
General Electric rose } to 71\, Ford Motor rose | to 45 and Alcoa
rose ~ to 64}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $5.68 billion, or 0.17
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.39 to 196.61.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.22 to 423.71, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.62 at 360.16.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
0.28 to 461.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 360.67, up 0.53.

   Marvin B. Roffman says he learned as a child
how to read stock tables at his grandmother's knee and later loved
his job as a stock analyst so much that he stood up to Donald Trump
and lost.
   The securities analyst was fired by the investment firm Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. after he told a newspaper that Trump's new
casino could encounter trouble because the economics of it were
flawed.
   What Roffman already knew, Trump's lenders eventually found out,
and the flamboyant developer had to renegotiate his enormous debts.
But that didn't mean Roffman got his job back.
   ``An analyst has to be independent and be allowed to express an
opinion, even if it's negative,'' Roffman said.
   The 50-year-old Janney Montgomery vice president was terminated
March 23 over his critique of Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Resort in
Atlantic City, N.J., one of the most extravagant structures into
the gaming business.
   The analyst told the Wall Street Journal the casino would
flourish for awhile after opening in April, but ``once the cold
winds blow from October to February, it won't make it. The market
just isn't there.''
   Trump threatened Janney Montgomery with a lawsuit unless Roffman
publicly retracted the comme a matter for the government of the
Philippines to determine. But he added that the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service's June 16, 1989, ``departure control
order'' prohibiting Mrs. Marcos from leaving the country remained
in effect.
   He said the ban was based on the potential for ``destabilizing
activity'' should she return to Manila as well as the legal
problems here.

<HEAD>Will GM's Saturn Succeed, or Will Japan Run Rings Around It?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It began as a secret project to create an
affordable, durable subcompact with 60-mile-per-gallon efficiency
that would leapfrog the Japanese and vault the nation's biggest
automaker into the 1990s and beyond.
   Eight years later, General Motors Corp.'s Saturn has transmuted
into a significantly larger, pricier car with a lower mileage
rating, a less ambitious production schedule and an audience of
skeptics.
   GM's showcase Saturn project has in many respects become a test
of whether American industry can adapt and beat the makers of
Hondas and Toyotas at what they do best: luring American consumers.
Just how GM intends to convince the buying public that Saturn is
superior remains to be seen.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith, Saturn's most enthusiastic supporter,
has said he plans to be at the wheel of the premiere model when it
rolls off the assembly line at the Saturn complex in Spring Hill,
Tenn. later this summer.
   But GM officials have declined to specify a date for the world's
first good look at a mass-produced Saturn, or whether they even
plan a rollout ceremony. Models are supposed to arrive in dealer
showrooms by fall.
   The Saturn saga began in June 1982, when GM put its best brains
to work on a hush-hush project aimed at revolutionizing carmaking
in the United States. They code-named it Saturn after the U.S.
rocket that helped overcome the Soviet lead in space exploration.
   About 2{ years later, Smith formally established Saturn Corp.,
calling it ``the key to GM's long-term competitivness, survival and
success.''
   Since then, curiosity and publicity have been diluted by
impatience, cynicism, setbacks and design alterations. The 60 mpg,
$6,000 subcompact prototype wonder that Smith flaunted became a 35
mpg, $10,000 compact with no obvious advantages over foreign rivals.
   GM's initial investment of $5 billion shrank to $3 billion. It
halved the number of workers to 3,000 and the annual production
from 500,000 to 250,000.
   There also have been suggestions of infighting between GM
executives and their subordinates at Saturn, who originally were
given wide latitude to move more quickly and responsively than at
their fat, lumbering parent in Detroit.
   Nonetheless, the goal has remained basically unchanged _ build
and sell a car that can recapture a market GM has lost to its
competitors, mainly the fiercely efficient Japanese.
   ``It's a lot more than just another 250,000 units,'' said Joseph
Phillippi, who follows the automotive industry for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., the New York investment firm. ``It's the whole
process, the completely integrated manufacturing nature.''
   Saturn's underlying premise is a ``clean sheet'' approach to
carmaking. Nothing in GM's manufacturing past was required for use
in Saturn. Design and engineering approaches for the car were to be
all new.
   If successful, the Saturn project holds tremendous potential for
the U.S. auto industry.
   One of Detroit's main frustrations, which Saturn presumably will
overcome, is the lengthy time it takes to bring a new car to
market, especially when consumer tastes can shift rapidly. Japan is
seen as the leader in what the industry calls quick product
turnaround time, usually three years or less.
   Some Saturn critics have said quick turnaround is exactly what
Saturn lacks: it's taken eight years to produce a three-year car.
But Saturn President Richard G. LeFauve has said that time was
needed to be sure the car was right for import-conscious buyers.
   ``We had to make constant adjustments to make the car more
responsive,'' he said. ``Most people think of it as a domestic
product. This car is not really a domestic in that it is not
designed in a domestic sense.''
   The Saturn complex that now occupies the rolling horse-farm
country of Tennessee is an experiment in automotive
self-sufficiency. The plant has its own stamping plants, powertrain
assembly and foundries.
   But perhaps the most far-reaching innovation is Saturn's labor
agreement with the United Auto Workers union. Workers are organized
into teams with broad decision-making powers and responsibilities.
They receive hundreds of hours of training and are expected to
understand the economics behind each car.
   ``It leapfrogs the Japanese structure and the European
structure,'' said Mike Bennett, president of Saturn's UAW Local
1853. ``If there is a new direction for the UAW, it's in Spring
Hill, Tennessee.''
   Saturn's factory laborers come from GM plants or layoff lists in
32 states and 136 GM locations, but they are working under a
contract that their 500,000 fellow autoworker unionists would find
alien. The chief differences:
   _The contract has no specific expiration date. Exactly one year
from the date of Job 1, management and labor may begin modifying
the contract, if necessary, on a day-by-day basis.
   _Saturn workers have a hand in design of the vehicle and the
factory itself.
   _Job classifications, which number in the dozens in traditional
automobile factories, have been pared to a few.
   _Saturn workers get paid 80 percent of the wages other UAW
members receive, but are eligible for bonuses depending on the
car's success.
   Elements of the contract could spread to other auto plants if
Saturn proves successful.
   ``If we see other plants adopt less job classification
categories, that would be a mark of success,'' said automotive
analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. in New York.
   GM's most immediate concerns are whether Saturn sells and who
buys it.
   The car's current estimated price hurls it against some of the
toughest competition in the U.S. car market, in which GM will not
only be battling with other automakers but itself as well. GM's
most popular models, the four-door Chevrolet Corsica and two-door
Beretta, are in the same price range.
   That means GM must attract the import buyer. The company has
said it hopes 80 percent of Saturn buyers will be import owners.
   ``The bottom line is that if you are driving a Honda or (Toyota)
Corolla today, you are going to feel very comfortable in a Saturn
car,'' LeFauve says. ``If you're driving a (Chevrolet) Cavalier or
something else in that area, you aren't going to feel that
comfortable.''
   But many automotive analysts remain skeptical about Saturn's
ability to change an entrenched preference for imports. GM's
passenger car market share has shrunk from about 44 percent to 33
percent just in the time since the Saturn project was conceived,
while the Japanese share has risen from 19 percent to about 25
percent.
   Moreover, industry studies continually show a growing American
preference for the reliability of Japanese cars. Just this past
week, for example, J.D. Power and Associates, a respected industry
research firm, said its study of 1990 buyers found that owners of
Japanese models were the happiest.
   David Healy, who follows the auto industry for Barclays Bank in
New York, said he would consider Saturn successful if it were able
to derive less than half its market from would-be buyers of other
GM cars.
   Otherwise, Healy said, Saturn ``may be an artistic success and a
financial failure.''

   Thomas O'Hara was a good student at Wayne State
University, but he didn't graduate near the top of his class, which
meant he was lucky to land an accountant's job at $15 a week.
   Those were the gray days of 1936, in the midst of the Great
Depression and just before the Great War, a time when communism
seemed on the way up and American spirits on the way down.
   O'Hara's spirits didn't succumb. ``Better red than dead'' was a
common slogan at the time, but it made no sense to him. ``My goal
was to catch the fast movers, the guys making $18 a week,'' he said.
   Fred Russell, a young fellow with little cash and big hopes,
provided the opportunity, an investment club to be guided by George
Nicholson, Jr., a stockbroker not long out of Harvard Business
School.
   Russell's hope was that each member would invest $10 a month and
that the total would be invested in stocks. It was 1940.
   Fifty 50 years later, O'Hara and his wife Eleanor were among two
dozen kitchen-table investors who gathered earlier this year to
dine on filet mignon and celebrate the golden anniversary of the
Mutual Investment Club of Detroit.
   In the 600 months since 1940, club members have invested
$227,877. Their joint portfolio now is worth $1,801,255.92.
   That appreciation is even more dramatic considering club member
withdrawals over the years _ more than $1 million to finance
businesses, homes, college educations, travel, retirement.
   The story of the Mutual Investment Club, reflected in the
fruitful lives of O'Hara and his co-investors, is a lesson in the
wisdom of old-fashioned thrift, which fell far out of fashion in
the booming 1980s.
   The investment club is a mix of old and young. Don Danko,
president, is 43, Bob Bilke a mere 28, and Ken Janke, Jr., just 32.
O'Hara's two sons are members, too. In contrast, 10 of the 22
members are 70 or older.
   The combination works well. If youth has dreams, age has
experience. Where younger members sparkle with hope, older ones
glow with knowledge. They complement each other.
   The Detroit club became the nucleus of the National Association
of Investors Corp., of which O'Hara is chairman and Ken Janke, Sr.,
president. Based in Royal Oak, Mich., it has 126,000 members _
14,631 as individuals, the rest in 6,933 clubs.
   Most follow simple rules. Members make small monthly
contributions, usually between $10 and $50, and they reinvest all
dividends. Withdrawals are allowed if contributions continue.
   Nicholson, 83, now revered as the founding father of the
international investment club movement, laid down the rules back in
1940:
   _Invest regularly, usually each month.
   _Reinvest all dividends.
   _Invest in growth companies, those growing faster than their
industries and the general economy.
   Other principles were developed. Diversifying, because stocks
ripen at varying times. And ``biological testing,'' to determine
whether management is young enough to maintain performance for at
least five years.
   Club members propose stocks for study, and after the reports are
in, they vote. Typically, shares are assigned to members on the
basis of their total contributions, and each month the share values
are determined.
   Underlying the investment club's way of doing things is the
conviction that economic fluctuations, the kind that cause so much
excitement on Wall Street, are of little concern to long-term
investors on Main Street.
   America's growth is strong, they reason, and when all the ups
and downs are averaged out, the arrow still points up. When markets
are up, club assets rise. When markets are down, the same amount of
money buys more shares.
   Investors who try to outguess the market aren't likely to win,
says O'Hara, a quiet man whose logic speaks profoundly. He puts it
this way:
   ``The stock market is not important; it's the businesses. The
business effort might not be reflected in the stock market
immediately, but eventually it will.
   ``Look at individual companies, and have confidence the market
will recognize value. It always has.''
   Most of the time the gains are more steady than spectacular, but
sometimes a stock takes off.
   The Detroit club bought American Cement, later to become Amcord,
at about $2.75 a share, and sold six years later at $32. With the
proceeds it bought Kennecott Copper at $25 and sold two years later
at about $63.
   More recently, the club has become a large holder in American
Family, an insurer selling now at more than $15 a share. The club's
average acquisition price was about $1 a share.
   Soon after joining the Detroit club, O'Hara was drafted and sent
to Iceland. With little to buy, he doubled his contributions to $20
a month and continued to do so throughout the war.
   Russell, rejected for service by a heart condition, invested the
money of O'Hara and other members. By the end of 1946, the record
read: Contributions $5,080, withdrawals $2,519, holdings $15,354.
Not bad for wartime, and the not-so-certain prospects for the
postwar period.

   After a slump, the value rose to $33,222 by 1952. Despite
withdrawals, the value nearly doubled again by 1955, once more by
the end of the decade, and again in 1965, when it reached $246,738.
   By the end of 1969, after deposits of $75,327 over the years,
the portfolio was worth $535,604. A critical mass had been
assembled. The dividends, always reinvested, now totaled more each
year than member contributions.
   Bad times severely tested the club's philosophy early in the
1970s, however. Brokers went broke, investors lost fortunes and
many clubs like Detroit's disbanded. Inflation raged.
   Keeping the faith, Detroit club members maintained
contributions, at a rate exceeding $7,000 a year. Even so, their
portfolio suffered. Its value fell more than $140,000 from the 1969
peak to just $393,434 a year later. After recovering to $430,000 in
the next three years it fell again to $387,959 in 1974. The club
still bought, confident of a rise to come. It did.
   By 1979, the portfolio was valued at $759,038, and by the end of
1982, when the market rediscovered fundamentally sound stocks, it
topped $1 million for the first time. Of course, it continued to
grow.
   Over 50 years, O'Hara's monthly contributions amounted to a
total of only $12,000. The club records show he withdrew $186,000
over the years but that he still had $183,000 left in the portfolio.
   Considering the small sum invested _ a person might have saved
that amount by foregoing cigarettes _ the return seemed bountiful.
It didn't make millionaires of everyone, but did allow them to
realize some dreams.
   A $3,000 withdrawal in 1950 helped Russell buy a Howard Johnson
restaurant franchise. Eventually he owned three, along with other
food outlets, and left his widow a comfortable inheritance.
   Bob Burger, who joined in 1946, withdrew $5,000 years ago to
found a business that developed into Chemetco, a mini-conglomerate.
   John Biscomb indulged an intense interest in William
Shakespeare, went to England and studied the bard on his own
grounds in Avon and London.
   Norman Hill, an original and wily investor, allowed his
contributions to accumulate to a current $346,000, a pillow of
comfort in his retirement.
   O'Hara and his wife traveled widely, bought their dream house,
sent their sons to private schools and colleges, and convinced them
to buy into the club. O'Hara became a New York Stock Exchange
governor, and still serves as a consultant on issues affecting
individual investors.
   Persistence is both the secret and the scourge of club investors.
   ``The hardest thing is just to stay in the business,'' O'Hara
said. ``In bad times it's easy to quit.''
   With dedication compounding works wonders, although it isn't
easy to explain this to those of a modern, get-rich-quick mentality.
   Begin with a penny and double its value each day, and 10 days
later it still amounts to only $5. But keep doubling, and you have
$5 million in about a month.
   The Detroit club amassed its fortune at a modest annualized rate
of 12.2 percent, doubling its assets each five to six years.
   Can the Detroit experience be repeated in these times of instant
gratification? Yes, if you have the motivation and the patience,
club members say.
   Modest goals help. Remember, half a century ago, O'Hara's goal
was simply to offset the $3 a week shortfall in his paycheck.

<TEXT>
   The story of the Mutual Investment Club of
Detroit is a textbook example of the wisdom of investing for the
long term.
   Below, at a glance, are some facts about the club and commentary
from AP Business Analyst John Cunniff, who first reported on the
club in the 1960s:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ORIGIN: The club was organized in 1940, when some young men
tried to put the Great Depression behind them and concentrate on
better times.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LEADERSHIP: Fred Russell, a fellow with little cash but big
hopes, had the idea for a club to invest in stocks. George
Nicholson, a young broker, drew up the guidelines, becoming widely
recognized as the father of the investment club movement. Thomas
O'Hara, a young accountant, made investment clubs his career.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GUIDING PRINCIPLES: Invest small amounts regularly, usually each
month. Reinvest all dividends. Invest in growth companies, those
growing faster than their industries and the general economy.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MEMBERSHIP: As the Detroit club succeeded after World War II it
gave birth to the National Association of Investors Corp., which
now has 126,000 members _ 14,631 as individuals, the rest in 6,933
clubs.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PORTFOLIO GROWTH: $10 and $20 investments built assets worth
millions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SAMPLE INVESTMENT: The goal was to double the investment within
five years, but sometimes the results were better. For example, the
purchase of American Cement at $2.75 a share and its sale six years
later for about $32.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   WITHDRAWALS: More than $1 million was withdrawn over the years
to buy houses, finance businesses, pay tuitions, provide
retirements.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   COMMENTARY: There are many messages in the Mutual Club's
experience.
   _Have patience. Recognize that time is a silent ingredient as
important to a portfolio as yeast is to bread.
   _Do your homework; know your investments. Invest in individual
stocks, not in ``the market.''
   _Invest for the long term. Don't try to time, trade or outguess
the market, and forget about trying to fathom the short-term ups
and downs of the economic cycle.
   _Recognize that ``down'' markets are temporary, to be followed
by better times.
   _Be confident that America's economy continues to grow, even if
it develops a cold from time to time.

<HEAD>Buyout Group Picks Former Northwest Exec For UAL Finance Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The employee group trying to buy United Airlines'
parent company has hired a former Northwest Airlines chief
financial officer, the buyout group said Tuesday.
   John A. Edwardson, 40, would become chief financial officer of
UAL Corp. and the airline if its unionized pilots, machinists and
flight attendants succeed in their $4.38 billion bid.
   Edwardson will leave his job as executive vice president and
chief financial and administrative officer of IMCERA Group Inc., a
Northbrook-based chemicals firm, on Friday.
   Edwardson would succeed John C. Pope, who announced last month
he would resign as UAL's chief financial officer if the buyout
succeeds.
   The buyout group has already hired Gerald Greenwald, a former
vice chairman of Chrysler Corp., to be chairman and chief executive
if the deal goes through.
   Greenwald, trying to convince potential lenders to help finance
the sale, has said he would surround himself with airline industry
veterans in a new UAL management structure.
   Edwardson was chief financial officer of Northwest Airlines from
1985 to 1988.
   The employee group has until Aug. 9 to secure financing for
their $201-per-share offer.

<TEXT>
   Foreign ministers from 24
industrialized nations meet Wednesday to discuss extending their
aid program for Poland and Hungary to four other new democracies in
Central Europe.
   On the ministers' agenda is a recommendation from the European
Community's executive commission to include Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Yugoslavia in the year-old aid
program.
   The program, known by its French initials as PHARE, would supply
food aid, provide training and financial assistance, help clean up
the environment and contribute to economic reconstruction and
investments.
   The four countries have asked to be included in the program,
which has already raised $310 million for Poland and Hungary. An
additional $62 million is due to be committed by the end of this
year and diplomats said another $248 million has already been
earmarked for Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Yugoslavia.
   The EC leaders delayed making a final decision to give financial
or other help to the Soviet Union at their June 25-26 summit in
Dublin, Ireland. They have agreed in principle to support President
Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts at economic reform by giving him some
kind of assistance.
   Aid to the Kremlin will likely be debated at this week's summit
in London of the leaders of the 16 nations of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization and also next week at the economic sumit of the
seven largest industrialized nations in Houston, Texas.
   The ministers originally included Romania in their
recommendation but then dropped it from the list because of concern
over political developments there, notably the government crackdown
on civilian demonstrators in June.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Rise In Tokyo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, dollar, comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly in morning trading against
the yen Tuesday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
also edged upward.
   The dollar started trading at 151.35 yen, down 0.05 yen from
Monday's close of 151.40 yen. The U.S. currency finished the
morning session at 152 yen with a morning low of 151.32 yen.
   The dollar finished at 150.90 yen in New York, down from 152.10
yen Friday.
   Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, a dealer with the Industrial Bank of Japan,
said shortly after the dollar opened that trading companies and
securities firms bought the dollar to cover short positions.
   The dollar then retreated slightly before posting its modest
gain.
   Toru Kanai, of New Japan Securities, said there wasn't much in
the way of news to affect the dollar.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues rose 59.37 points or 0.998 percent, ending the morning
session at 32,219.60. The index gained 219.99 points on Monday, and
was up again by 322.19 by the morning market close.
   ``Public works spending was the central reason for the rise,''
said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst for Nomura Securities. Last week,
Japan promised the United States to boost public works spending
over 10 years. Construction and housing stocks were high, as were
industrial machinery and high-tech stocks, he said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell slightly from Monday's close of
86.53 to 86.48. The yield stood at 7.30 percent, almost unchanged
from Monday's 7.29 percent.
