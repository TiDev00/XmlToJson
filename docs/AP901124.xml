   Military spending in the Persian Gulf visibly
helped swell the federal budget deficit for the first time in
October, according to a Treasury Department report.
   The government opened the 1991 fiscal year last month with a
$31.5 billion deficit, up 21 percent from $26.1 billion in the same
month a year earlier.
   Military spending at $24.1 billion rose $4.9 billion, a 26
percent increase from a year earlier. That was somewhat offset,
however, by $1.6 billion in contributions from U.S. allies.
   ``This is the first time that the Persian Gulf spending is
really showing up'' since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, said
economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. consulting firm. ``Until
now, the military has been supplied mainly out of inventories.''
   The Resolution Trust Corp., charged with cleaning up bankrupt
S&amp;Ls, also contributed to the deficit increase. It spent $10.7
billion, 36 percent more than in the same month a year ago.
   Despite the five-year, $500-billion deficit-reduction plan
adopted by Congress last month, the Bush administration has already
conceded that the 1991 deficit will set a record.
   In remarks last week, Richard Darman, director of the White
House Office of Management and Budget, said he expected a 1991
budget gap of $250 billion to $300 billion, more if a shooting war
breaks out with Iraq.
   Red ink in 1990 totaled $220.4 billion, just short of the $221.2
billion record set in 1986.
   The new deficit-reduction package does not project a balanced
budget until 1996. Under the Gramm-Rudman law, as originally
adopted in 1985, the deficit was to fall to zero in the current
fiscal year.
   Many analysts believe the slowing economy eventually will
depress tax revenues in 1991. In October, though, individual income
tax payments, mostly withholding from paychecks, rose 15 percent to
$40.7 billion.
   ``The economy is giving appearances of falling into a recession,
but we haven't had a collapse in payroll employment yet,'' said
economist William V. Sullivan Jr. of Dean Witter Reynolds, a stock
brokerage firm.
   ``As the economy continues to deteriorate, employment will begin
to contract. And that will surely take its toll on tax revenues,
and we will begin to see a wider deficit,'' he said.
   Government revenues in October totaled $78.7 billion, up 15
percent from a year earlier, while spending amounted to $110.2
billion, up 17 percent.
   After the military, the biggest spending category was Social
Security, down 2 percent from a year earlier to $19.4 billion.
   Interest on the $3.24 trillion national debt amounted to $18.1
billion, a 10 percent rise.
   Programs in the Department of Health and Human Services,
excluding Social Security, spent $17.3 billion, up 30 percent. This
includes Medicare and Medicaid.

<HEAD>As Bush Lines Up World Support, War Powers Debate Lingers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The debate over President Bush's power to send
American troops into combat in the Mideast without congressional
approval is heating up as international support grows for using
force to free Kuwait.
   Even as Bush proclaimed he is ``very, very close'' to having
enough support for a United Nations resolution authorizing force
against Iraqi forces in Kuwait, Democratic congressional leaders
again said they must have a say on whether to send American GIs
into combat.
   ``I think if a decision is made to change that policy, to seek
an offensive military action by the United States against Iraq,
then there will have to be prior approval by the Congress and, I
believe, extensive debate in the Congress and in the country,''
said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, on Friday.
   Bush has pledged to consult with Congress but has indicated he
might not provide advance notice of any military action or seek
advance approval.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., joined Mitchell in urging
Bush to seek congressional approval before committing U.S. forces
to fighting, and said the president's chances of winning that
backing would improve if the United Nations endorsed the use of
force.
   ``It would have some significant impact if the United Nations
granted such a resolution,'' Foley told reporters.
   If the U.N. resolution is adopted, ``then I would hope Congress
would reconvene and take similar action,'' said Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. ``The president ought to have that
authority and have the Congress behind him.''
   Such a course would lessen the chance of an after-the-fact fight
over the right to declare war. But there still may be opposition in
Congress to endorsing an attack.
   Mitchell agreed with Foley that a U.N. resolution would give
Bush better odds at winning a congressional endorsement, but said
it would not guarantee one.
   ``It would depend upon the circumstances that exist at the
time,'' said Mitchell.
   Mitchell, in a speech earlier this week, acknowledged ``a
reasonable basis for argument on both sides'' over whether the
Constitution requires the president to get Congress' approval
before ordering U.S. troops into hostilities.
   The debate also has split legal scholars.
   ``The constitutional argument, not to put too fine a point on
it, is almost certainly wrong,'' Yale Law School professor Stephen
L. Carter said in a recent essay published in The Washington Post.
``There is nothing in the history of the ratification of the
Constitution to suggest that the founders imagined that a
congressional declaration of war would be needed whenever American
troops fought an engagement.''
   Taking the opposite view are attorneys at the Center for
Constitutional Rights, which is representing 45 House Democrats in
a suit seeking an injunction prohibiting Bush from ordering U.S.
troops to attack Iraqi forces unless Congress gave its approval.
   ``If the president takes it upon himself ... to initiate such a
war without the unequivocal consent of Congress, the victim of
Iraqi aggression will be not just Kuwait but the Constitution of
the United States,'' the center contended in the lawsuit, due for a
Dec. 4 hearing.

   Drug addicts trying to scrape up quick
cash in this struggling mill city are turning to the unusual
plunder of disposable diapers, baby formula and Tylenol, police
say.
   Across the country, addicts in Los Angeles are likely to grab
car stereos while in Miami, aluminum awnings and copper wire are
snagged by those looking for ready money, police there said.
   ``The times keep changing on what's the hot items. I suppose
it's like the fashion world,'' said Holyoke Police Capt. Richard C.
Page.
   Reports of disappearing diapers at area pharmacies and
supermarkets started about six weeks ago, said Page, head of the
bureau of investigations in Holyoke, an old factory city of 60,000
people that has fallen on hard times.
   ``We've been noticing a real pattern of it,'' he said. ``We
started talking to some of the people that we deal with and they
said that's the thing to take. Everybody will buy it.''
   The thefts are not sophisticated, Page said.
   ``This time of year, it's so busy, you can walk out the door
with a cart with three or four cases of baby formula. If
challenged, they just walk away from the cart or run off,'' Page
said.
   The diapers can net a return as high as 50 cents on the dollar,
said Page, much higher than the usual 10 cents or 15 cents realized
on stolen goods. The goods are sold on the street or to small
stores that are not choosy about the merchandise's origins, he
said.
   Although some major metropolitan police departments such as New
York and Detroit said they haven't noticed trends in thefts by drug
addicts, others had, saying the predominant theme is items that are
hard to trace and easily unloaded.
   ``Most people out here, what they rip off tend to be car stereos
to turn a profit for their narcotic trade,'' said Officer Don
Lawrence, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.
   Police said they noticed the addict thefts became noticeable
over the past decade.
   ``What we're getting is a lot of them are stealing aluminum and
copper. They steal aluminum awnings off the buildings and copper
wiring,'' said Miami Police Department spokesman Bobby Navarro.
``At first it caught us by surprise and then we were just a little
bit more looking out for things like that.''
   In New Bedford, a once prosperous Massachusetts port that has
seen a decline like Holyoke, addicts seem to be stealing guns,
mainly from house burglaries, said Sgt. James Sylvia.
   The stolen guns can easily be sold to dealers for a few bags of
heroin, he said.
   ``They've got everything from Uzis down to the smallest,''
Sylvia said.
   Although hard-to-trace easy thefts are the usual target, there
are exceptions, police said.
   ``We've had people from time to time, the news crews who are out
covering news at particular locations, for whatever reason turn
their back on unloading their camera, turn around and the whole
camera's gone. These guys are going for whatever they can get their
hands on,'' Lawrence said.

<HEAD>Gulf Action Prompts Army to Halt Retirements, Discharges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Service in the all-volunteer Army no longer is
entirely voluntary.
   Because of the Persian Gulf buildup, for the first time since
the draft was abolished in 1973 the Army has suspended laws that
normally allow officers and enlisted members to leave when their
service obligations are fulfilled.
   The Army announced Friday that the demands of Operation Desert
Shield have forced it to halt all voluntary retirements and to
prevent enlisted personnel from leaving.
   The move will mean that about 5,500 people per month who
otherwise would have left the service will be forced to stay on
indefinitely.
   The decision was approved by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. It
is an extraordinary move that will upset the plans and expectations
of many soldiers, including those who had lined up civilian jobs in
anticipation of retiring or who had planned to enter college after
completing their enlistments.
   The Army also said it is freezing indefinitely all transfers of
soldiers from overseas to bases in the United States and is
cancelling the traditional Christmas vacation period for all Army
training centers and military schools.
   The cancellation of holiday vacations will affect 22 Army
institutions, not including the West Point, N.Y., military academy.
Included are seven basic training posts such as Fort Jackson, S.C.;
and advanced training centers such as the artillery school at Fort
Sill, Okla., the infantry training post at Fort Benning, Ga., and
the personnel, administration and finance school at Fort Benjamin
Harrison, Ind., said Army spokeswoman Capt. Barbara Goodno.
   Army officials offered those examples of affected installations
but declined to provide a complete list.
   The freeze on transfers will affect between 1,000 and 1,500
people per month, said an Army official who discussed the measures
on condition he not be identified.
   The combination of measures is designed to keep the Army at the
highest possible state of readiness in case additional
reinforcements are needed in the Persian Gulf crisis, the official
said. It reflects a view among senior military leaders that the
U.S. commitment to the gulf will be longstanding, he said.
   ``I've got an unprecedented deployment underway in Saudi
Arabia,'' which required the Army to take the extreme step of
preventing soldiers and officers from leaving the service, the
official said.
   About 130,000 Army personnel are deployed in Saudi Arabia, and
another 100,000 are heading there.
   Also on Friday, the Marine Corps disclosed it invoked a measure
on Nov. 8 that means as many as 12,000 Marines, both regular and
reserve, could be prevented from leaving the service even though
they were due to retire or end their service obligations. Unlike
the Army, the Marines will not apply the measure service-wide, said
Maj. Nancy J. LaLuntas, a spokeswoman at Marine Corps headquarters.
   The Navy has not taken any measures to force sailors to stay in
the service, but it has not ruled out doing so in the future, said
Lt. Beci Brenton, a Navy spokeswoman.
   The Marines also announced Friday activation of another 2,377
reservists for Desert Shield. Nearly all will report for duty with
the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp Lejeune, N.C., to
reinforce approximately 45,000 Marines in the gulf.
   President Bush on Aug. 22 gave Cheney legal authority to retain
members of the armed forces on duty in the gulf who reach their
retirement or re-enlistment dates. But the authority was limited to
those soldiers and officers directly involved in Desert Shield.
   In taking its action Friday, the Army went a step further and
applied the authority to everyone in the service.
   The Army since Sept. 1 had used the authority on a limited
basis, retaining about 2,000 personnel per month who otherwise
would have retired or not renewed their service contracts.
   The Army said there will be three exceptions to the mandatory
extensions of service: officers who face mandatory retirement for
medical or other reasons, soldiers discharged for reasons of
incompetence or other failings, and hardship cases.

<HEAD>Diplomatic Protest Planned Over Swiss Handling of Bush Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American officials plan to file a formal
protest over Swiss security officers who jabbed a U.S. diplomat
with a machine gun and roughed up a news photographer traveling
with President Bush in Geneva.
   ``It's so strange - supposedly a peace-loving nation gave us the
most vicious treatment I've ever seen,'' White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday aboard Air Force
One en route home from Switzerland.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. government would file a formal protest
over a number of incidents that occurred when Bush arrived in
Geneva for a three-hour stop and again on departure. He also said
White House chief of staff John Sununu was ``verbally attacked''
when he complained.
   ``I've never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a
security force in the last 10 years,'' Fitzwater said.
   American chief of protocol Joseph Reed was poked in the abdomen
with a machine gun in one of the airport incidents.
   Fitzwater said Reed would summon Swiss Ambassador Edouard
Brunner and lodge a formal protest next week after Bush returns
from a trip to Mexico.
   ``They pulled a machine gun on Ambassador Reed ... and verbally
attacked the chief of staff (Sununu),'' Fitzwater said.
   Officers clashed with newsmen and photographers in the
president's party on arrival in Geneva, pushing and shoving them as
they sought to approach the ramp on which Bush would leave the
plane.
   Fitzwater said that at a hotel in Geneva later Sununu brought up
the airport incident with the chief of security. He said Sununu was
met with verbal abuse.
   Guards lined up shoulder to shoulder prevented reporters and
photographers from approaching the president's ramp on departure.
No one could see Bush at the base of the ramp, though he and Mrs.
Bush were visible when they climbed the ramp to board the aircraft.
   White House press aides tried to get the Swiss officers to move
out of the way, and a shouting match followed.
   It was then that Jerome Delay, a Washington-based photographer
for the French news agency Agence France-Presse, was roughed up and
the machine gun shoved into Reed's abdomen, Fitzwater said.
   Reed was trying to reboard the plane, Fitzwater said.
   There was no immediate word on whether Delay was hurt. The
Washington bureau of the news agency said it had no word of any
injuries.
   Fitzwater said he had not discussed the incident with Bush.
   There was no answer at the Swiss embassy in Washington Friday
night. No separate number is listed for the ambassador.

   Gerow Hodges once gave his friend,
multimillionaire Ralph Waldo Beeson, a pair of corduroys. After
Beeson told him how much he enjoyed them, Hodges gave him another
pair.
   But, as Hodges recalled, ``He would not accept them because he
already had one pair, and he said that was enough.''
   Beeson, who made his money in insurance, practiced frugality all
his life and spent sparingly.
   ``Two or three years ago he gave his yard man about $10 and sent
him to buy groceries, and the man came back with three or four
dollars in change,'' said Thomas Corts, president of Samford
University in Birmingham. ``He asked the man for the rest of the
change and he said that was all there was. `Well, good gracious,
you must have bought enough groceries to last a month.'''
   Beeson died Oct. 15 at age 89 and left more than $80 million to
schools and to his church.
   The bulk goes to Samford University, to which he had given $14.4
million over the years, and to Asbury Theological Seminary in
Wilmore, Ky. Each gets $38.8 million.
   ``I never expected a gift of this magnitude,'' said Corts, whose
school has 4,200 students.
   Lesser amounts were left to two small colleges in Tennessee and
North Carolina and to Independent Presbyterian Church in
Birmingham, where Beeson annually gave no more than the church's
average contribution.
   According to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel,
the $38.8 million was the largest gift to individual schools since
1986, when the estate of Lilliore Green Rains gave $40 million each
to Stanford University, Loyola-Marymount University, California
Institute of Technology and Pomona College.
   Beeson and his wife, Orlean, who died in 1987, lived in a
unpretentious home overlooking Samford, where a bronze statue of
the philanthropist sits on a bench near the center of the campus.
The Beeson family name is on several buildings.
   ``He had a deep sense of stewardship,'' Corts said. ``He didn't
wear a halo and didn't want to impress anybody with how pious he
was.''
   Beeson waited until he was 40 to marry. ``He wanted to make
certain he could appropriately provide fora wife,'' Corts said.
They had no children.
   Beeson was a native of Meridian, Miss., where his father, John
Wesley Beeson, was president of old Meridian College; his father's
three brothers also were college presidents.
   In 1927 he got in on the ground floor of a fledgling Birmingham
insurance company called the Heralds of Liberty.
   He helped build it into Liberty National Life Insurance Co. and
eventually became a director. The company was founded by Frank
Samford, for whom the university is named.
   He supported Asbury Seminary because a former president there,
J.C. McPheeters, was a graduate of Meridian College.
   The seminary, although independent, mainly trains Methodists.
Samford is Baptist and Beeson was Presbyterian.
   ``He always thought brand names weren't as important as what you
believed,'' Corts said.
   After serving in the Navy in World War II, Beeson was asked by
Gen. Omar Bradley to establish a program for veterans' insurance.
Later he became a consultant, training people in insurance
management.
   If he had an extravagance, it was boating. He belonged to the
Pensacola (Fla.) Yacht Club and the Lake Guntersville Yacht Club in
Alabama.
   That extravagance didn't extend far.
   Laverne Farmer, a friend, recalled that Beeson recently
complained to him that the 50-cent part needed to repair his
refrigerator was no longer in stock. He said he would have to buy a
new refrigerator.
   ``I asked him how old the other one was and he said he had
bought it in 1946 or 1947, but that he sure wasn't going to buy the
same brand because they don't last long,'' Farmer said.
   His frugality also came ahead of personal comfort at home.
   ``He wouldn't let you turn on the air conditioning in the
summer,'' Corts said. ``You just sat there and wiped your brow. He
would say it costs a fortune to run that thing.''

<HEAD>Report Calculates Job Loss From U.S.-Based Japanese Car Factories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manufacturing Japanese cars in the United
States cost America 36,000 jobs in 1988 and 1989, congressional
auditors say.
   The General Accounting Office of Congress said Friday that new
Japanese-owned factories in the United States generally are more
efficient than U.S. automakers and require fewer workers to produce
the same number of cars.
   The GAO said some 11,000 jobs were lost in 1989 and 25,000 the
previous year.
   Fewer jobs were lost last year in part because the Japanese
manufacturers bought more parts from U.S. sources, the watchdog
agency said.
   The GAO report was prepared at the request of Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., and Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio.
   The GAO said it used a complicated formula based on the
assumption that cars produced in Japanese-owned U.S. factories
displaced both imported Japanese cars and cars that otherwise would
have been sold by General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
   Its report said Japanese-affiliated factories in America turned
out 1,131,000 cars in 1989 and calculated that this ``provided
66,000 jobs but displaced 77,000 other jobs,'' for a net loss of
11,000.
   The Japanese factories used U.S. sources for 50.5 percent of
their parts and components in 1989, compared to 38.5 percent the
previous year, the GAO said.
   The GAO said the U.S. Big Three car companies employed 4,151
people per 200,000 cars of production compared to only 2,613 by
Japanese-affiliated automakers.

   Roald Dahl, the British author of macabre
short stories and light-hearted children's tales such as ``Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory,'' died Friday, his agent said. He was
74.
   Dahl died at John Radcliffe Hospital, where he was admitted on
Nov. 12 with an undisclosed infection, his agent Murray Pollinger
said.
   Dahl wrote nine books of short stories, including ``Kiss,
Kiss,'' three novels, 19 children's books, and numerous screenplays
and scripts for television. Last year, his total paperback sales in
Britain topped 2.3 million copies.
   His 1964 ``Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was adapted for
film as ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.'' Dahl also wrote
the screenplays for Ian Fleming's ``Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang'' and
Fleming's James Bond thriller, ``You Only Live Twice.''
   Dahl married American actress Patricia Neal in 1953 and helped
her recover from a series of strokes in the mid-1960s that
threatened her ability to speak. They were divorced in 1983 and he
married Felicity Ann Crosland.
   ``Roald Dahl's contribution to the children's book world is
immeasurable,'' said a spokesman for publishers Puffin and Penguin,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He and his books are held in
the deepest affection by families all over the world.''
   Dahl said his secret in his children's tales was that he entered
a conspiracy with children against adults.
   ``It's the path to their affections,'' he said in an interview
earlier this year with The Independent newspaper. ``It may be
simplistic but it is the way. Parents and schoolteachers are the
enemy.
   ``The adult is the enemy of the child because of the awful
process of civilizing this thing that when it is born is an animal
with no manners, no moral sense at all.''
   Dahl was also known for his unnerving short stories.
   One critic with the Times Literary Supplement said Dahl ``knows
how to steer an unwavering course along the hairline where the
gruesome and the comic meet and mingle.''
   ``He thinks of a story as a staircase up which the reader is to
be lured and finally coaxed into taking that confident last step
which, breathtakingly and deliciously, isn't there,'' the critic
wrote.
   Reviews of ``Kiss, Kiss'' in 1960 saw in his ``caricature of
human weakness'' signs of a ``social satirist and moralist at work
behind the entertaining fantast.''
   He has been compared to Angus Wilson as well as to Saki and
Salvador Dali.
   ``I never knew him, but I was a great admirer of his,'' said
Theodor Geisel, or ``Dr. Seuss,'' in a telephone interview from his
California home. ``He wrote excellent children's books and I was
very interested in his short stories for adults.''
   Dahl provoked controversy in February 1989 when he wrote a
letter to The Times of London describing Salman Rushdie, author of
``The Satanic Verses,'' as a ``dangerous opportunist.''
   Two weeks earlier, Rushdie had gone into hiding under police
protection because Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, had said Rushdie deserved to die for blasphemy.
   ``Clearly, he (Rushdie) has a profound knowledge of the Moslem
religion and its people, and he must have been totally aware of the
deep and violent feelings his book would stir up among devout
Moslems,'' Dahl wrote.
   ``This kind of sensationalism does indeed get an indifferent
book on the top of the bestseller list ... but to my mind it is a
cheap way of doing it.''
   Dahl worked for a number of children's charities and recently
donated the manuscript and copyright of his story ``The Vicar of
Nibbleswicke'' to the British Dyslexia Institute.

   Supporters of the proposed Two Forks Dam in
Colorado say they may go to court to challenge a decision by
federal environmental officials to kill the project.
   If the veto of the dam by the Environmental Protection Agency is
sustained, it could set a precedent for similar projects, they
said.
   William H. Van Schooneveld, chairman of the Metropolitan Water
Providers that sponsored the Colorado dam, said, ``This decision
affects not just Denver, but it may be the end of all big water
projects. If EPA can veto this, there really isn't any project that
anybody can develop that can pass the EPA.''
   ``There are a lot of grounds for (a federal court) appeal,'' he
said.
   Conservationists hailed the EPA action.
   Hope Babcock, general counsel for the National Audubon Society,
said, ``The era of building these enormous projects is over.''
   EPA announced the veto of the dam Friday night, confirming
earlier unofficial reports.
   The proposed Two Forks Dam would be the largest non-federal
water project in the West. It had been supported by Reagan
administration officials.
   Assistant EPA administrator for water, LaJuana S. Wilcher,
announced Friday she would uphold the recommendation of EPA's
Denver office to bar construction of the 615-foot dam just
downstream of the confluence of the South Platte River and its
North Fork.
   The city of Denver and 40 suburban water providers sought
approval to construct a 359-billion gallon reservoir southwest of
Denver to meet water needs well into the next century. The Army
Corps of Engineers said in March 1989 it would grant a permit to
dam the river, subject to EPA review.
   Conservationists opposed the project because it called for
flooding 30 miles of scenic river and ruining 14 miles of top-class
trout fishing.
   Denver proposed a smaller, 147-billion gallon reservoir and a
package of measures aimed at minimizing harmful environmental
effects.
   ``The applicants made a good-faith effort to downscale the
project size and compensate for the loss of wetlands and aquatic
resources,'' Wilcher said.
   ``However, the smaller project would still flood 24 miles of
freely flowing, scenic stream and almost 11 miles of gold medal
trout fishery. ... It would inundate an area of unquestionable
natural beauty that provides a diversity of fishing and
recreational opportunities and a rich aquatic habitat close to the
Denver metropolitan area.''
   The Army's environmental impact statement in 1988 identified
several other choices. Wilcher said EPA agreed that ``less
environmentally damaging, practicable alternatives exist,'' and the
agency would ``make every effort to provide timely comment and
guidance on other alternatives.''
   Big dams have made possible the growth of big cities and big
farms in the West. Critics say that too many water resources have
been diverted, threatening the balance of nature.

   It was apparently late Wednesday night,
unseasonably chilly even for November, when Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher faced the cold reality that most of her party wanted her
to quit.
   Only hours before, she had strode confidently from 10 Downing
Street, the official residence, to say she was intent on beating
Michael Heseltine, the former defense secretary who had challenged
her for leadership of the governing Conservative Party.
   ``I fight on, I fight to win!'' she had declared.
   According to statements by aides and allies, as well as accounts
in Friday's newspapers, it was all downhill from there.
   The prime minister seemed in good form earlier Wednesday in the
House of Commons, delivering a report on the European security
summit in Paris. Then she surprised lawmakers with a rare
appearance in the Commons' tearoom to solicit support.
   Later, in her office at the House of Commons, she met one by one
with a succession of Cabinet ministers and old allies.
   Most delivered the same brutal message: the rank-and-file were
defecting after Mrs. Thatcher's failure to dispatch Heseltine
cleanly in the first round of a party leadership vote.
   ``It's a funny old world,'' she told some of her messengers,
according to The Times and The Daily Telegraph.
   Only a few of her staunchest allies encouraged the prime
minister to push on.
   ``It took just a few hours for Mrs. Thatcher to realize she had
lost touch with reality, that her supporters on the right of the
party were seeing the world through eyes focused on her earlier
triumphs,'' wrote Philip Stephens, the respected political writer
of The Financial Times.
   To Thatcher loyalists, it looked like a palace coup. ``It's rank
treachery. Our own people have done it,'' complained Tory lawmaker
Edward Leigh.
   The agony began Tuesday evening when Mrs. Thatcher, in Paris for
the 34-nation security summit, learned that she had narrowly failed
to gain the margin of 56 votes needed to beat Heseltine in round
one that day. Of the 372 Tory lawmakers, 204 voted for the prime
minister, 152 for Heseltine and 16 abstained.
   She responded within minutes.
   ``Look, I have more than half the votes of the parliamentary
party. It was not quite 15 percent above those of Mr. Heseltine.
... so it means we have to go forward for a second ballot,'' she
told reporters.
   She then changed into a formal gown to join other government
leaders for ballet and dinner at Versailles. She arrived a few
minutes late, smiling radiantly.
   But she was sufficiently rattled to leave the summit early.
Returning to London at midday Wednesday, she sacked her campaign
manager and began drawing up new battle plans.
   She received some welcome advice from staunch allies Norman
Tebbit and party chairman Kenneth Baker. According to Stephens,
they convinced her that her first-round failure was simply ``due to
a lack of lack of organization and commitment,'' and predicted she
would win on the second ballot, when all she needed was an outright
majority.
   But the Cabinet reportedly was becoming increasingly mutinous.
John MacGregor, the leader of the House of Commons, ascertained
that 12 of 21 Cabinet ministers thought Mrs. Thatcher should
resign, Stephens said.
   Mrs. Thatcher, however, reportedly seized on the upbeat report
from Tebbit and Baker. When Tim Renton, the government's chief
vote-counter in the House of Commons, told her the rank-and-file
support was collapsing, Stephens said that she snapped: ``Who else
can beat Heseltine?''
   That evening, in those one-on-one meetings, The Times said she
old one visitor: ``I am coming under an awful lot of pressure.''
   The final blow, according to Stephens, was delivered by John
Wakeham, whom Mrs. Thatcher had installed earlier in the day to
direct her campaign.
   Wakeham is an old and trusted friend. His first wife was one of
five people killed in 1984 by an Irish Republican Army bomb that
ripped through a hotel where Mrs. Thatcher was attending a party
conference.
   ``Wakeham ... came back to report his soundings among members of
parliament. Yes, the Cabinet was right. She had to withdraw,''
Stephens said.
   The next morning, she made the announcement to her Cabinet.

   Rage against Margaret Thatcher animated some of
the liveliest corners of British culture in the past decade, and
with her departure many an artist has lost a muse.
   ``There will be a period in which we feel her loss,'' playwright
Peter Flannery said Friday.
   ``Culturally, she was an especially clear and pleasurable
target,'' said novelist and screenwriter Hanif Kureishi. ``Her
ideology is so clearly obnoxious.''
   With the Labor Party split and demoralized for much of Mrs.
Thatcher's conservative tenure, the role of opposition fell to the
``chattering classes'' - including Harold Pinter and his wife,
historian Antonia Fraser, and novelists Salman Rushdie and Ian
McEwan.
   John Mortimer, author of ``Rumpole of the Bailey,'' created the
amoral, grasping politician Leslie Titmuss as a Thatcherite
character in the novel ``Paradise Postponed,'' which became a TV
miniseries.
   Mrs. Thatcher was assaulted in Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses,''
on stage in David Hare's ``The Secret Rapture'' and in hard-hitting
TV fare such as ``A Very British Coup'' and the grotesque puppets
of ``Spitting Image.''
   On screen, Kureishi and director Stephen Frears achieved
international renown with a pair of films that let rip against
Thatcher's Britain: ``My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``Sammy and
Rosie Get Laid.''
   The state-subsidized stages of The National Theater and The
Royal Shakespeare Company rang with denunciations of the free
market ethos of Thatcherism.
   It was not the best way to catch the attention of the prime
minister, who showed little enthusiasm for culture save for an
occasional night of opera at the Glyndebourne Festival. Her tastes
in literature ran to Jane Austen, Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Frederick Forsythe.
   Mrs. Thatcher had her friends in the arts, including Andrew
Lloyd Webber and novelist-playwright Jeffrey Archer, who briefly
was Conservative Party deputy chairman. Kingsley Amis, who became a
knight thanks to Mrs. Thatcher, claimed she had replaced Queen
Elizabeth II in his dreams.
   On the left, however, it was open season.
   ``She didn't kill poetry in 11{ years - she's not that powerful
- but if she had been there for another 11{ years she might have,''
said Mary-Kay Wilmers, an editor of the left-leaning London Review
of Books.
   At the National Theater, David Hare wrote three plays -
``Pravda'' (with Howard Brenton), ``The Secret Rapture,'' and
``Racing Demon'' - all influenced to varying degrees by the
Thatcher zeitgeist.
   The Royal Shakespeare Company had two hits with ``Fashion,''
Doug Lucie's biting satire about an ad agency executive named Cash;
and ``Singer,'' Flannery's sprawling play about postwar Britain.
   In ``Singer,'' the title character becomes an avaricious
property developer who lends his name to a phenomenon, Singerism,
not dissimilar from that recently coined term Thatcherism.
   ``What we're going to write about now, I don't know,'' said
playwright Flannery.
   But Terry Hands, artistic director of The Royal Shakespeare
Company, said few writers ever truly came to grips with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   ``I can remember in the late '80s saying, `Where are the plays
about these Thatcher years?' as if the whole country was cowed,''
Hands said in an interview.
   He thinks it is too late now to throw any more brickbats.
   ``Play writing has either got to be timeless, as `Singer' was,
or precisely on the button,'' Hands said. ``God defend us from
plays written about yesterday.''
   Who will be the new target?
   Former Defense Minister Michael Heseltine, Foreign Secretary
Douglas Hurd and treasury chief John Major are all running to
succeed Mrs. Thatcher as the Conservative Party leader and prime
minister. Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock also hopes to be prime
minister before long.
   ``There will be plays about Heseltine; there will be plays about
Kinnock,'' said Peter Hall, former artistic director of the
National Theater. ``Art exists to challenge the status quo.''

   With the possibility of tens of thousands
of casualties if war breaks out with Iraq, U.S. and allied
officials are making plans to cope in the Persian Gulf and
elsewhere.
   The Center of Defense Information in Washington has estimated
that a three-month conflict would leave 10,000 American soldiers
dead and 35,000 wounded, a staggering number that would swamp
hospitals in the gulf region.
   Officials are reluctant to discuss details, but the military has
plans to airlift wounded to Germany and other countries.
   The Americans also have agreements with Israel and Britain on
handling casualties. Britain has been Washington's staunchest
supporter in the Persian Gulf crisis; Israel is America's closest
ally in the Mideast.
   U.S. officials have been reported checking out medical
facilities in Greece and elsewhere to cope with potential
casualties.
   ``You've seen the numbers on casualty estimates. We're going to
be overwhelmed,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Chris Kain of Bremerton, Wash.,
one of four orthopedic surgeons at the northernmost Marine field
hospital in Saudi Arabia.
   ``We're used to seeing those kinds of wounds, but not at such
huge, huge volumes,'' Kain said. ``If you try to save them as they
come through one at a time, you're going to have people backed
up.''
   Here is a look at medical facilities and what is being done in
preparation for war:
   -In the Persian Gulf: Behind the medics and company aid posts at
the front, U.S. Marines have five field hospitals, and the Navy has
a 500-bed tent facility. The hospital ships USNS Mercy and USNS
Comfort, two converted oil tankers, are also in the gulf.
   Britain has a base hospital at Jubail, and medical personnel on
ships in the gulf.
   Saudi Arabian hospitals could handle up to 3,000 war casualties.
In Bahrain, teams of U.S. medical specialists have been working to
prepare local facilities. It is estimated that Bahrain could see
700 seriously injured arrive each week.
   -Elsewhere in the Mideast: Israeli officials refuse to comment
on what facilities they could provide, stressing that Israel is not
directly involved in the gulf confrontation. But military sources
said there is a standing agreement to fly wounded to Israeli
hospitals.
   -In the Mediterranean: Britain's Royal Air Force base at
Akrotiri, Cyprus, has a well-equipped military hospital. Many
allied casualties are likely to be taken there.
   ``A wounded man is a wounded man, and he's on our side whether
he's British or American,'' a British military spokesman said.
   Athens newspapers report that U.S. defense officials have
investigated Greece's military hospitals to determine their
capabilities.
   A U.S. Embassy official in Rome said there is a standing
agreement with NATO allies for emergency medical support and that
would include use of hospitals in Italy.
   There is also a hospital at Incirlik air base in Turkey.
   -Elsewhere in Europe: The United States keeps three standby
hospitals in Britain at RAF bases. Britain maintains nine military
hospitals that could be expanded if fighting erupts. The Defense
Ministry also has contingency plans for state-run civilian
hospitals to treat war wounded.
   The Americans also have large army hospitals at Landstuhl and
Frankfurt in Germany, and a U.S. Air Force hospital at Wiesbaden.

<TEXT>
   Four European NATO nations have
scrapped plans for an attack helicopter following three years of
bickering over specifications for the aircraft, the Dutch Defense
Ministry said.
   Britain, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands began the project to
develop the European Light Attack Helicopter in 1987 in an effort
to reduce reliance on American-built weaponry.
   But a Dutch Defense Ministry spokesman said Friday ``it was
economically impossible to meet all the specifications'' set by the
four nations. A 1989 estimate put the project development at $3
billion.
   The project was also abandoned because of improved relations
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, said the spokesman, who asked not
to be identified.
   The aircraft would have been based on the A-192 Mongoose assault
helicopter built by the Italian firm Augusta.

   The drug trade is being blamed for a record
number of homicides in the nation's capital this year.
   Police said the Friday stabbing of an unidentified man in an
apparent robbery attempt brought to 436 the number of homicides in
the District of Columbia, breaking last year's record of 434 with
more than four weeks remaining in 1990.
   Investigators said the latest victim staggered to a nearby
drugstore for help, but later died at Howard University Hospital.
Two other people were found shot to death before dawn Friday.
   ``We'd like to stop these damned murders,'' said Lt. Reggie
Smith, a Metropolitan Police Department spokesman. ``But arrests
alone are not the only answer. The thing is to persuade people not
to get involved in drugs; not to fall to social ills that we have
seen over the years.''
   ``The thing that is driving drug crime in D.C. is the sale and
distribution of drugs,'' said Richard Bennett, professor of justice
at American University. ``Police can have very little effect on
that as long as there is supply and demand.''
   However, the proportion of people arrested testing positive for
drug use has fallen in the past year, and the percentage of
homicides classified by police as drug-related as fallen from 66
percent in 1988 to 39 percent this year.

   The fume-spewing little car that carried

automotive oblivion.
   The last Trabant will be built sometime next year after about
10,000 cars are delivered to Poland under an agreement with the
former East German government, the German Economics Ministry said
in a statement Friday.
   The boxy Trabant - often called a Trabi - was the staple of East
Germany's auto industry for three decades.Its top speed is around
62 mph.
   Trabants became famous in the West when East German refugees
drove them into Bavaria in September 1989. They also brought East
Germans into West Berlin on Nov. 9, 1989, when the Berlin Wall
opened.
   A Trabant is even in a Munich museum.
   Many fiberglass-body Trabants have been purchased by motorists
in the West as a symbol of German unification.

   Tadeusz Mazowiecki's campaign strategists
have had a hard time creating a warmer, more personable image for
the serious, somber prime minister.
   Mindful of the relaxed demeanor of his main rival - Lech Walesa,
a born politician - aides have had Mazowiecki play badminton for a
television ad and gotten his sons to reminisce about family
dinners. They even prodded the prime minister to produce one of his
rare smiles for a campaign poster.
   At campaign stops, Mazowiecki has joked about his dour image.
   ``I can't behave in this campaign like a young girl looking for
a husband,'' he has said more than once.
   This week, his aides might have gone too far.
   Mazowiecki, a 63-year-old widower who spent decades writing for
Catholic publications, emerged from a hotel Wednesday night to find
he was supposed to ride through Warsaw in an open horse-drawn
carriage - surrounded by four fur-clad, would-be beauty
contestants.
   Visibly chagrined, he balked.
   ``I'll walk,'' he said. ``Let's go.'' But no one moved.
   After some urgent negotiations, Mazowiecki - known for his
stubbornness - bowed to his handlers' urgings, and got into the
carriage.

   Walesa was once a lean young electrician who leapt atop a
shipyard fence to start a decade-long battle against communism. He
has grown somewhat stouter with success.
   Walesa says he has plans to try to change that.
   ``I will be sending my representatives to all those official
dinners,'' Walesa told reporters at his Gdansk headquarters this
week, patting his ample paunh.
   Otherwise, he said, ``I would not fit through the presidential
door.''

   Ever since Michal Boni, the head of Warsaw's Solidarity chapter,
endorsed Mazowiecki rather than Walesa for president, the phone has
been ringing off the hook - at his mother's house.
   In an appeal printed Friday in Poland's largest newspaper, Boni
asked opinionated voters to avoid taking out their feelings on his
mother.
   ``I ask all those who do not agree with my views and speeches
not to use the telephone directory and not to harass my 71-year-old
mother, with whom I no longer live,'' he wrote, adding plaintively:
``Please do not curse at her.''

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, having led his country out
of communism, last summer fulfilled another long-held dream for
himself and his compatriots - persuading the Rolling Stones to play
Prague.
   Mazowiecki is not a product of the rock 'n' roll generation and
has never been known to boogie. But he must have been taking notes.
   Addressing a youthful audience at the Warsaw Polytechnic
Institute during the campaign's last days, the normally staid prime
minister made a campaign pledge - to invite the Stones to Poland if
he becomes president.

   Britain will spend at least $1.96 billion by the
end of March on its military force in the Persian Gulf under
present deployment plans, a defense official predicted.
   Defense Secretary Tom King on Thursday said 14,000 more troops
will join the 16,000 British soldiers already in the gulf.
   More than 330,000 troops from the multinational force have been
sent to the gulf since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The United
States plans to increase its troop strength to 430,000 by January.
   Britain will be spending a total of $47 million a week in
operating costs once the new deployment is complete, said the
Ministry of Defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Last month, Pentagon officials estimated cost of the U.S. gulf
deployment should exceed $15 billion by the end of fiscal 1991.

   Lessons in rock climbing and wilderness survival are combined
with courses in etiquette and cultural sensitivity in the master of
business administration program designed to boost professional
ethics and broaden students' creativity.
   The novel program kicked off this fall with 80 students who
camped out together in a three-day outdoor course conducted by
Outward Bound.
   ``The students aren't learning to live with dirt and eat
berries,'' said Tom Watkins, who headed the committee that first
explored modifying the private university's MBA curiculum.
   The goal in adding the wilderness venture was to build teamwork
among students and faculty, he said. Exercises that included
building a raft and navigating it to an assigned spot tested
students' leadership and ethics.
   For example, did they really paddle to the spot or pretend they
did?
   ``They've got the `bottom line' in their technical skills,''
said local cable-television magnate Bill Daniels, who helped
bankroll the program with a $10 million grant. ``What I want to
teach is how they can get to the top and succeed quicker.''
   Students and faculty returned to the wilderness this month for
eight days. In September, they helped build a trail to complete
required volunteer duty.
   A ``boot camp'' that will include seminars on professional
manners, negotiating skills and conflict resolution is scheduled
for December.
   Backed by Daniels' grant, the university created the Institute
for Professional Excellence. Watkins was named its director.
   Skeptics have said the University of Denver's program, although
ambitious, may be unrealistic. Among them was Chuck Hickman of the
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, the
accrediting agency for business schools.
   ``Is a graduate business school the proper place to teach people
which fork to use?'' asked Hickman, referring to the school's
courses in social skills.
   Faculty members say the focus is on the big picture, like ethics
questions in the marketplace, not table manners.
   ``You see a lot of programs throwing in ethics courses, but we
have tackled it head on,'' Watkins said.
   Daniels said he was surprised when his grandnephew told him that
he didn't have to take an ethics course while attending Harvard's
business school.
   ``I don't know if we can teach ethics and integrity, but we're
going to find out,'' he said.
   Young executives often tend to ignore things like returning
phone calls, getting along with fellow workers, looking
professional and contributing to their communities, he said.
   Professional integrity and corporate leadership are two issues
brought up in a recent flurry of studies on American business
education.
   A report by the Graduate Management Admissions Council, which
represents 300 business schools, said business schools must better
prepare students for a radically changing world - one that demands
more responsibility and understanding of different cultures.
   ``The problems of the `90s are business problems - economic
competitiveness, environmental tradeoffs,'' Hickman said.
``Business schools are going to take the lead response to those
problems.''

   Why was Santa Claus fired?
   Old St. Nick says false allegations of lewd advances by one of
his elves caused the ouster, but the manager of the shopping mall
that dismissed Santa said the group wasn't up to ``standards.''
   ``It was the administration of the operation,'' said Lawrence
Rose, manager of the Seneca Mall just outside Buffalo.
   Rose this week terminated Old Style Music Inc.'s contract to
provide Santa service this holiday season. He said the dismissal
had to do with poor scheduling of Santa appearances and Santa's
hours of operation.
   Bernard Zolnowsky, Old Style president and ``head Santa Claus,''
said that's not true.
   ``They were quite happy with our Santa Clauses,'' Zolnowsky said
Friday after he and several employees picketed the mall dressed in
their costumes. ``The only thing we saw was the problem with the
elf.''
   Shoppers arriving at the mall Friday were greeted at the
entrance to the parking lot by workers dressed as Santa, Mrs. Claus
and elves holding signs that read ``Out of Work.''
   Zolnowsky said Rose told him last Sunday of an alleged encounter
between an employee at a store in the mall and an elf who was part
of the Santa service.
   ``They said the elf on Saturday had made a comment to a store
employee that he wanted to molest her body,'' said Zolnowsky, who
declined to identify the man hired as an elf.
   ``On Sunday, he told us he wanted the elf terminated,''
Zolnowsky said. ``They said, point blank, if you don't fire the
elf, we'll terminate your contract.''
   Rose said the mall's attorneys have told him not to comment on
any allegations concerning the elf, but he said that wasn't the
reason Old Style's contract was invalidated.
   ``We terminated the contract on the basis of the general quality
in the operation of the Santa Claus operation,'' said Rose. ``We
did not feel this was up to our standards.''
   Rose said the contract between Old Style and the mall allows
management to cancel the deal without giving a specific reason.
   Zolnowsky said when he first heard about the allegation ``there
was steam coming out of my ears. My first idea was to fire this
person.'' But he said the elf convinced him that he didn't say
anything to the woman who complained.
   Zolnowsky said the mall management refused to provide him with
any proof of the allegation or an affidavit containing the store
employee's claim.

<HEAD>South Korean Vessels Sail Up Border River For First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a sign of detente, South Korean
ships today sailed up a river along the heavily fortified border
with Communist North Korea for the first time in 37 years,
officials said.
   Eight vessels involved in a dredging operation entered the
Demilitarized Zone this morning near Kanghwa island off the western
coast and were sailing up the Han River, Defense Ministry officials
said.
   It was the first voyage by civilian vessels along the tightly
sealed border since 1953, when an armistice agreement was signed to
end a three-year Korean war.
   The vessels are to dredge sand and pebbles for use in the
construction of a 24-mile riverside expressway from the South
Korean capital to a bridge short of the truce village of Pamunjom.
   North Korea has been notified of Seoul's project to utilize
border areas for peaceful purposes, Seoul officials said. They said
there has been no objection from the north.
   The two Koreas have held an unprecedented meeting of premiers
this year, opening the way for first cultural and sports exchanges
across the border in September and October.
   The peninsula was divided in 1945 at the end of World War II.
The border on both sides is heavily fortified and guarded by more
than 1 million troops.

<HEAD>Short Story and Screen Writer Roald Dahl Dead at 74</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OXFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roald Dahl, a writer whose works for
children appeared on film as ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate
Factory'' and ``Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang,'' has died. He was 74.
   Dahl died Friday at John Radcliffe Hospital, where he was
admitted on Nov. 12 with an undisclosed infection, his agent Murray
Pollinger said.
   Dahl wrote nine books of short stories, including ``Kiss,
Kiss,'' three novels, 19 children's books, and numerous screenplays
and scripts for television. Last year, his total paperback sales in
Britain topped 2.3 million copies.
   His 1964 ``Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' was adapted for
film as ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.'' Dahl also wrote
the screenplays for Ian Fleming's ``Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang'' and
Fleming's James Bond thriller, ``You Only Live Twice.''
   Dahl married American actress Patricia Neal in 1953 and helped
her recover from a series of strokes in the mid-1960s that
threatened her ability to speak. They were divorced in 1983, and he
married Felicity Ann Crosland.
   ``Roald Dahl's contribution to the children's book world is
immeasurable,'' said a spokesman for publishers Puffin and Penguin,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``He and his books are held in
the deepest affection by families all over the world.''
   Dahl said his secret in his children's tales was that he entered
a conspiracy with children against adults.
   ``It's the path to their affections,'' he said in an interview
earlier this year with The Independent newspaper. ``It may be
simplistic, but it is the way. Parents and schoolteachers are the
enemy.
   ``The adult is the enemy of the child because of the awful
process of civilizing this thing that when it is born is an animal
with no manners, no moral sense at all.''
   Dahl was also known for his unnerving short stories.
   One critic with the Times Literary Supplement said Dahl ``knows
how to steer an unwavering course along the hairline where the
gruesome and the comic meet and mingle.''
   ``He thinks of a story as a staircase up which the reader is to
be lured and finally coaxed into taking that confident last step
which, breathtakingly and deliciously, isn't there,'' the critic
wrote.
   Reviews of ``Kiss, Kiss'' in 1960 saw in his ``caricature of
human weakness'' signs of a ``social satirist and moralist at
work.''
   ``I never knew him, but I was a great admirer of his,'' said
Theodor Geisel, better known as ``Dr. Seuss,'' in a telephone
interview from his California home. ``He wrote excellent children's
books, and I was very interested in his short stories for adults.''
   Dahl provoked controversy in February 1989 when he wrote a
letter to The Times of London describing Salman Rushdie, author of
``The Satanic Verses,'' as a ``dangerous opportunist.''
   Two weeks earlier, Rushdie had gone into hiding under police
protection because Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, had said Rushdie deserved to die for blasphemy.
   ``Clearly, he (Rushdie) has a profound knowledge of the Moslem
religion and its people, and he must have been totally aware of the
deep and violent feelings his book would stir up among devout
Moslems,'' Dahl wrote.
   ``This kind of sensationalism does indeed get an indifferent
book on the top of the bestseller list ... but to my mind it is a
cheap way of doing it.''
   Dahl worked for a number of children's charities and recently
donated the manuscript and copyright of his story ``The Vicar of
Nibbleswicke'' to the British Dyslexia Institute.
   Dahl was born Sept. 13, 1916, in Wales, the son of Norwegian
parents.
   During World War II, he was a Royal Air Force fighter pilot and
was seriously wounded over the Libyan desert. He recovered in time
to fight against pro-Nazi forces in Syria.
   He began his writing career when the novelist C.S. Forester
asked him for an account of his air force experiences and the story
was published in the Saturday Evening Post.
   He is survived by one son and three daughters by his marriage to
Ms. Neal. Another daughter is deceased.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

   Billy Idol canceled four concerts in Europe
this week when grit got under his contact lenses and scratched his
eyeball.
   The rock star, coming back from a serious motorcycle accident,
is in the second week of his ``Charmed Life'' European tour.
   He resumed performing in Frankfurt, Germany, on Friday night,
wearing a patch over his injured eye and sunglasses to protect
himself from the bright stage lights, said spokeswoman Sharon
Chevin in London.
   The injury occurred during an outdoor show in Oslo, Norway, last
Saturday, said another spokeswoman, Sarah McMullin, in Houston.
   Idol canceled concerts in Gothenberg, Sweden; Copenhagen,
Denmark; and Brussels, Belgium. He was to make up the Brussels
concert today and plans to reschedule the other shows, Chevin said.
The European tour started Nov. 14 in Helsinki, Finland.

   CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - Imprisoned country singer Johnny
Paycheck, best known for the working-class anthem ``Take This Job
and Shove It,'' has filed for bankruptcy.
   Paycheck sought protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Charleston, according to court documents filed Nov. 16.
   The singer, whose real name is Donald Lytel, is serving a 7- to
9{-year prison sentence in the Madison Correctional Institution in
London, Ohio, for aggravated assault.
   Paycheck's court filing listed more than $1.6 million in debts,
most owed to the Internal Revenue Service. No assets were listed.
   He was sentenced to prison last year after being convicted of
shooting and wounding a man on Dec. 19, 1985, in a Hillsboro, Ohio,
bar. He is eligible for parole in December 1994.

   MIAMI (AP) - Two members of the singing group Menudo, which once
was active in Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No'' anti-drug campaign,
were fired hours after their arrest for alleged marijuana
possession, a spokesman said.
   Sergio Gonzalez, 18, and Ruben Gomez, 16, were arrested Thursday
at Miami International Airport, Metro-Dade police Lt. James Kaelin
said.
   Oscar Llord, general manager for Miami-based Sonotone Music,
said Friday the Puerto Rican-based group's management had fired the
singers.
   Menudo was on a stopover en route from Mexico City to Venezuela
when a U.S. Customs Service dog sniffed out the marijuana, Kaelin
said. Customs agents confiscated about 1.6 ounces of pot from
Gonzalez and 1.3 ounces from Gomez.
   They were charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession.
   Members of Menudo, which loosely translates as ``small change,''
are replaced with younger members as they get too old to appeal to
their pre-teen and teen-age audiences. The group was formed in the
late 1970s.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - South African playwright Athol Fugard, who
calls on the young of his nation to lead the battle against
apartheid, took his message to U.S. high school students, some of
whom were skeptical.
   A group of students from Dorsey High School critiqued Fugard's
play ``My Africa! My Children!,'' after viewing a show this week at
the Henry Fonda Theatre.
   The play centers on three South Africans - a black teacher and
two gifted students, one black, the other white.
   ``How can you, as a white man, speak for black people?'' a black
student asked Fugard.
   ``I accept no limitations on my imagination,'' he said. ``The
mission of artists is to transcend the limits of human experience
and go anywhere.''
   ``How can you say that it's up to young people to change things,
when those in power are making sure that apartheid stays intact?''
asked senior Vincent Lopez.
   ``I meant that it's up to young people to break down that
system,'' Fugard explained. ``Youth in any country, especially the
U.S., can't just sit back and expect things to change. You all have
to become political animals.''

   BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) - David Lynch, the creator of the offbeat TV
series ``Twin Peaks,'' says he peppers the show with references to
his native Montana because the state is ``just a part of my life.''
   ``I only spent a couple of months (in Montana) actually,'' Lynch
said in a recent interview. ``But I've always heard stories from my
dad about Montana.''
   Lynch moved with his family from Missoula to Sandpoint, Idaho,
while still an infant. But his parents still own a cabin in
Whitefish, Mont. His grandfather homesteaded near Highwood, Mont.,
and his father was born in Fort Benton, Mont.
   He said ``Twin Peaks'' is a town that could be anywhere in
Washington, Idaho or Montana. Although the show often dwells on the
darker side of small-town existence, he said he chose the Northwest
setting because of its ``underlying strength and wholesomeness.''
   ``I hope that the Northwest stays pure and that people protect
what they have,'' Lynch said.

   President Bush returned home early Saturday after
conferring separately with the presidents of Egypt and Syria,
enlisting crucial Arab support for his intensifying drive to expel
Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
   The president's Boeing 747 jet touched down at Andrews Air Force
Base just outside Washington, D.C., at 1:04 EST. Bush immediately
boarded a helicopter to fly to Camp David, Md., for the weekend.
   The White House had emphasized that no ``partial solutions'' to
the Persian Gulf were acceptable and Bush said he was ``very very
close'' to rounding up the support he wants for a United Nations
resolution authorizing the use of force.
   Even without a U.N. vote, he said, ``we have the authority to do
what we have to do'' to counter Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Nevertheless, before leaving for home, Bush devoted the final
day of an eight-day overseas journey to diplomatic sessions with
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, his most solid Arab ally in the Persian
Gulf crisis, and with Hafez Assad of Syria, his most improbable.
Syria is viewed by the United States as a sponsor of terrorism, and
Bush's meeting with Assad was the first in 13 years between
presidents of the two nations.
   Assad sidestepped a question of whether Syrian forces would
fight alongside Americans in an offensive operation. But the
statement issued by the White House said the two men agreed the
Iraqi occupation of Kuwait is unacceptable and the ``legitimate
government (of Kuwait) must be restored fully.''
   Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, described the
president's session with Assad as ``pretty good, pretty tough.''
   Asked if his opposition to Iraq's occupation meant he would
support the use of force, Mubarak said, ``By all means.''
   A White House statement said Bush and Assad discussed human
rights and ``had an extended conversation of the question of
terrorism.''
   It also said Bush asked for Syria to help win the release of
American hostages held in Beirut. Among them is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
taken captive in 1985.
   In addition, the two men discussed the overall Middle East peace
process and the ``importance of moving ahead'' with U.N.
resolutions addressing the Palestinian issue, the White House
statement said.
   Bush made his diplomatic rounds as Senate Minority Leader Robert
Dole, returning from the Middle East, said he would urge Congress
to reconvene immediately if the United Nations endorsed the
resolution on force against Iraq and that he hoped Congress would
take similar action.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who accompanied
Dole, said a yes vote in the United Nations would not necessarily
guarantee one on Capitol Hill. ``It would depend upon the
circumstances that exist at the time,'' the Maine Democrat said.
   Shortly before Bush flew home, a Soviet official at the United
Nations said the Security Council would convene next week.
   After Bush left Geneva, the White House complained that Swiss
security officers had shoved a machine gun into the stomach of a
U.S. diplomat and roughed up a photographer traveling with the
president. White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the
United States would file a formal protest with the Swiss government
over the incidents, which occurred at the base of the steps to Air
Force One.
   The hastily arranged Geneva trip was the final stop on a
five-nation, eight-day trip for Bush that began in Europe, where
East and West joined together to bury the Cold War, and culminated
in a Thanksgiving dinner with the troops in Saudi Arabia.
   As he concluded his diplomatic mission, the Army was announcing
that it would suspend the retirements of thousands of soldiers
coming to the end of their enlistment periods and would freeze all
transfers of soldiers overseas to bases back to the United States.
The Army said these soldiers may be needed to back up Operation
Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf.
   Bush used much of his time overseas to mount an aggressive
diplomatic campaign for a United Nations resolution authorizing
force in the Persian Gulf.
   Mubarak was unequivocal in his declaration on Kuwait.
   ``The Iraqi invasion must be reversed and Kuwait must be
liberated,'' the Egyptian leader said. ``For both of us it's a
matter of principles and moral courage.''
   Said Bush: ``We're tired of the status quo and so is the rest of
the world.''
   Their meeting was a session between longtime allies, and Mubarak
has been a key Arab partner in the international coalition to force
Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Bush's other diplomatic meeting of the day seemed more awkward,
yet demonstrated the lengths the president is willing to go to
force Iraq's withdrawal.
   ``Mr. Assad is lined up with us with a commitment force,'' Bush
said at the news conference in Cairo before travelling to
Switzerland to meet with the Syrian leader.
   Earlier, Assad told reporters, ``We have the hope there will be
between us convergent viewpoints.''
   U.S. cooperation with Assad has elicited strong criticism in
Congress, and Mitchell reflected that dismay in comments to NBC
News Friday night: ``I personally have grave reservations about the
president and the United States engaging in that kind of a
relationship with the leader of a government that has been
identified by the administration itself and our government as
terrorist.''
   At a joint news conference, Bush and Mubarak both made it clear
that they intend to work to win the approval of the United Nations
Security Council of a resolution authorizing force against.
   ``We haven't given up on the peaceful solution at all. We have
been very very patient. We've gone to the United Nations for 10
separate resolutions and indeed there will be another resolution,''
Bush said.
   But he added: ``I do feel we have the authority to do what we
have to do. But we have tried very hard to work within the U.N.
confines of the Security Council. And I have confidence that we
will be successful in the Security Council.''
   For his part, Mubarak said Syria was ``one of the key countries
... and we should not neglect it.''
   ``I don't know if he felt left out, but he's an important
coalition partner,'' Bush added, referring to Assad.
   Mubarak, in opening remarks at a news conference, stressed the
importance of resolving the Palestinian issue. Bush reiterated the
U.S. position, offering to be a catalyst for peace but insisting
that the dispute be resolved apart from the Persian Gulf showdown.
In particular, Bush said, ``I want to see a solution to the
question of the West Bank,'' which Israel seized from Jordan in the
1967 war.
   Bush said the meeting with Assad does not represent a turning
point in relations with Damascus. ``We've (still) got big
differences with Syria,'' Bush said.
   The president's diplomatic drive received a setback on Thursday,
when Secretary of State James A. Baker III was frustrated in
efforts to get backing from Yemen, the only Arab nation on the
15-member U.N. Security Council.
   Yemen's president, Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, criticized the
military buildup in the region and called for an Arab solution to
the crisis. Yet, a State Department official said, ``They didn't
say no'' to a new U.N. measure.
   ``We'd like to get Yemen on board,'' Bush said anew Friday .

   President Bush, relaxing at Camp David after
returning from the Middle East and Europe, says he is confident the
United Nations will approve using force to drive Iraq from Kuwait
and perhaps a deadline for taking action.
   ``The world is getting tired of this,'' Bush said Fridayof
Iraq's nearly four-month-old occupation of Kuwait.
   Bush arrived home early today from the Middle East after
stopping in Geneva for three hours of talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad. The White House said the two leaders agreed that Iraq
``should receive no reward for its aggression'' and that there
should be no `partial solutions'' to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Assad sidestepped a question of whether Syrian forces would
fight alongside Americans in an offensive operation.
   Bush also met in Cairo with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
who proclaimed his willingness to use force. ``By all means,'' he
said.
   There was an unexpected and jarring note to the windup of Bush's
eight-day trip when Swiss security forces roughed up members of the
presidential party. White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
called it ``brutal and vicious treatment.''
   He said a security man jabbed a machine gun into the stomach of
Ambassador Joseph Reed, the U.S. chief of protocol. Another
security agent verbally abused John Sununu, the president's chief
of staff, Fitzwater said.
   He remarked, ``It's so strange - supposedly a peace-loving
nation gave us the most vicious treatment I've ever seen.''
   Some members of the press corps accompanying Bush were roughly
shoved and punched. Fitzwater said the president witnessed some of
the unpleasantness. Fitzwater said he didn't know what provoked it.
   The stop in Geneva was the last leg of a trip to Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Paris, Germany and Czechoslovakia. The Persian Gulf crisis
was the overriding topic of the trip.
   Bush said he was very close to getting United Nations approval
for using force to oust Iraq from Kuwait but that even without it
``we have the authority to do what we have to do.''
   He said the U.N. Security Council would be ``discussing not only
the need to consider further action, but perhaps a time frame.''
   ``We're tired of the status quo and so is the rest of the
world,'' Bush said in a joint news conference with Mubarak.
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, returning from the
Middle East with other congressional leaders, said he would urge
Congress to reconvene immediately if the United Nations endorsed
the resolution and that he hoped Congress would take similar
action.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who accompanied
Dole, said a yes vote in the United Nations would not necessarily
guarantee one on Capitol Hill. ``It would depend upon the
circumstances that exist at the time,'' the Maine Democrat said.
   Bush and Mubarak both made it clear that they intend to work to
win the approval of the United Nations Security Council of a
resolution authorizing force against Iraq.
   ``We haven't given up on the peaceful solution at all. We have
been very, very patient. We've gone to the United Nations for 10
separate resolutions and indeed there will be another resolution,''
Bush said.
   Bush was the first U.S. president since Jimmy Carter in 1977 to
meet with Assad and he defended his decision to appear with a
leader who is criticized by the United States as a sponsor of
terrorism and an oppressor of human rights.
   ``They're on the front line, standing up against aggression,''
Bush said. He said he would work with countries that can enhance
the prospect of driving Iraq from Kuwait.
   Fitzwater said Bush and Assad held ``an extended conversation on
the question of terrorism, agreeing to continue the U.S.-Syrian
dialogue with the goal of achieving positive results.''
   Bush also asked Syria to do everything in its power to help win
the release of hostages in Lebanon, Fitzwater said.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser,
described the Bush-Assad meeting as ``pretty good, pretty tough.''

   Animal rights activists kicked off the Christmas shopping season
with protests across the country, urging buyers not to give a fur
to someone they love this holiday season.
   In what has become an annual ritual, demonstrators marched on
high-fashion shopping spots from New York's Fifth Avenue to San
Francisco's Union Square as part of ``Fur Free Friday'' protests.
   Most demonstrations were peaceful, although six people were
arrested for blocking the entrances to a Neiman Marcus department
store in San Francisco. Among the protesters was rock singer Grace
Slick, whose request to be arrested was rejected.
   The demonstrations come at a bad time for the fur industry. The
Christmas shopping season is expected to be sluggish at best -
dampened by a faltering economy that many merchants fear will keep
buyers from spending on lavish gifts like mink coats.
   But Mark Kirkland, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Fur
Information Council of America, said the protests had little or no
impact on shoppers Friday.
   A light rain held down the size of the largest march, in New
York, where police said 1,400 people gathered. There were more than
2,000 last year.
   Led by a costumed grim reaper slowly banging a drum, two
marchers clad in skeleton costumes wheeled a cart crammed with furs
in what a placard called a ``free burial'' for those who would
``donate your dead.''
   ``Get a feel for fur - slam your fingers in a car door,'' mocked
another poster. Protesters complain that the animals used to
manufacture the luxury garmets are inhumanely killed.
   In San Francisco, police said six people were charged with
misdemeanors for blocking entrances to the Neiman Marcus store.
   ``I'll go,'' Slick said as the demonstrators were taken to a
police van parked near the store's northwest entrance.
   ``No,'' police Lt. Daniel Hallisy told the former lead singer
for the Jefferson Airplane. ``We're not going to take you.''
   In a protest that was largely symbolic, 16 people in Manchester,
N.H., demonstrated outside a busy shopping center that has no
furrier.
   About 30 people picketed outside South Square Mall in Durham,
N.C., while about 15 gathered in front of Furs by Monta in
Charlotte, N.C.
   In downtown Harrisburg, Pa., a costumed grim reaper led about 40
people in front of the Strawberry Square shopping center.
   The protesters say their actions have hurt fur sales, adding
that such stores as Seattle-based Nordstrom and Harrods of London
have decided to disband their fur boutiques.
   Industry officials deny the protests have hurt, saying sales
were up 10 percent last year.
   Ken Durrant, vice president of the Fur Farm Animal Welfare
Coalition, said the animals are not inhumanely killed. He said the
coalition's guidelines require that its members kill animals
painlessly with bottled carbon-monoxide gas.

<HEAD>Nation's Blood Supply Safe from Rare AIDS Virus Strain, CDC Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare strain of the AIDS virus could get into
the nation's blood supply, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
says it's too rare to spend money trying to detect it.
   Only 18 known cases of the strain, known as human
immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2), exist in the United States.
Tests for the more common AIDS virus, HIV-1, usually detect the
rarer strain, predominantly found in West Africa.
   A study of more than 25,000 blood samples detected no blood
donors with HIV-2 infection. The CDC concluded that adding HIV-2
tests to routine blood donor screening wouldn't be worth the cost
of more than $60 million a year.

<HEAD>Malaysian Museum Hunts Up Skulls From Around the World</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto KL2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX FERNANDEZ</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Museum says you may
touch the artifacts in a coming exhibition, but it's not for the
faint-at-heart.
   The display will include human skulls, deformed craniums and
shrunken heads from around the world.
   Mexican cake in the shape of human skulls, headhunting weapons
and Hollywood posters with macabre titles like ``Brain Eater,''
``Headhunter,'' ``Scalp hunters,'' and ``Skulduggery'' are also
among the items.
   The show, dubbd ``Heads and Skulls in Human Culture and
History,'' took a year to prepare. Underwritten by a local company,
it begins Jan. 16 and lasts for a year.
   Shahrum Bin Yub, the director-general of the government's
Museums Division, says the aim of the show is to educate, inform
and dispel superstition by showing headhunting as it was practiced
in many parts of the world as late as the early part of this
century.
   Shahrum says he made two world tours collecting artifacts from
museums and universities for the exhibition. He said he brought
back about 100 skulls.
   He has just returned from Mexico, where he attended the six-day
Celebration of the Dead. He saw children eating little cakes shaped
as skulls, so he brought some back for display.
   Shahrum says the exhibition will include skulls, weapons used in
headhunting, costumes, and shields.
   He said that in some societies, headhunting was viewed as an
initiation rite. A young man seeking to marry or pass into manhood
had to bring back a head, usually of his enemy.
   Some of the skulls contain holes made with primitive tools.
   Shahrum explained that people in certain societies believed that
headaches were caused by evil spirits, so holes were made in the
skulls to free the spirits. The cure was no doubt more painful than
the headache.
   An example comes from Africa in 1957. An expedition encountered
a living example of the skull-boring practice known as trephination
- a man from the Tibu tribe. He had two huge scars in his scalp and
carried in his pocket two fragments of his own skull.
   Among the prize exhibits is the well-preserved skull of a
Chinese, Jimmy Ah Sue, who was hanged in Australia in 1880. His
skull, borrowed from an Australian museum, survived long after he
was gone because a Russian scientist wanted to study his brain.
   During the exhibition, there will be a demonstration of
phrenology, the analysis of character by studying the shape of the
skull. The exhibition will also focus on how skulls are used in
primitive art.
   Shahrum is preparing a 400-page booklet on the customs and
practices of people who headhunted.
   For instance, headhunters in Assam in northeastern India
believed that the head possessed potent magical powers and that the
human soul resided there. Thus, possessing someone's head meant
owning his soul and controlling his power.
   Shahrum is no stranger to the dark side of the archival life.
His current Treasures from the Grave exhibition has attracted about
700,000 people, including many foreign tourists. A prize exhibit is
an Egyptian mummy borrowed from a British museum.

<HEAD>New York Daily News Loses Big Advertisers as Strike Persists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily News, its circulation devastated by a
month-long strike, has lost one of its biggest advertisers, Macy's
department store, just as the heavy holiday advertising season is
getting under way.
   Macy's confirmed Friday it has dropped its advertising in the
Daily News, and officials for striking unions said the A&amp;S
department store, another big advertiser, has done the same.
   The newspaper's two tabloid rivals, the New York Post and New
York Newsday, have reported large advertising and circulation gains
since the strike began Oct. 25.
   ``This is obviously all strike-related,'' Newsday spokeswoman
Chiara Coletti said.
   Newsday's Friday paper had 192 advertising pages, 24 more than a
year ago, according to the newspaper.
   The Post's Friday edition had 90 ad pages, 40 more than last
year's, officials at the newspaper said.
   Friday's Daily News had 47 pages of advertising. The newspaper's
spokeswoman, Lisa Robinson, refused to discuss the departure of
advertisers.
   The Post and Newsday featured ads from Macy's and A&amp;S. Neither
store took out ads in Friday's Daily News.
   Liz Holland, a Macy's spokeswoman, said the store was no longer
advertising in the Daily News. Jim White, director of operations
for A&amp;S, declined to say if his store had dropped the newspaper.
A&amp;S ads have not appeared in the Daily News since Tuesday.
   Nine unions are striking the newspaper over what they term
unfair labor conditions.
   The Daily News has published every day since the strike began,
but many vendors have refused to sell it.
   The Daily News had a daily circulation of 1.09 million before
the strike. It has said it is now printing 600,000 papers a day and
getting 400,000 to customers.
   New York Newsday officials said their paper's daily circulation
has risen from about 150,000 before the strike to about 340,000.
The paper's Long Island edition has a circulation of about 600,000.
   Post officials said their newspaper's circulation is up from
about 500,000 before the strike to between 700,000 and 750,000.

<HEAD>Archbishop Says Vatican Pressure Won't Get Him to Back Down on
Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN BASHINSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic archbishop denied an honorary
doctorate degree because he surveyed women on their reasons for
seeking abortions says Vatican pressure won't keep him from
speaking out.
   ``I can't imagine (being stopped) unless you take out my
tongue,'' Archbishop Rembert Weakland said Friday. ``I must admit I
may be too upbeat about it. Maybe that's not good''
   Weakland said he respects the church's opposition to abortion
but thinks church leaders should examine the reasons why Catholic
women are willing to seek abortions anyway.
   Switzerland's University of Fribourg had planned to award
Weakland an honorary doctorate this week, but canceled the ceremony
after pressure from the Vatican's Congregation of Education.
   In the letter to Fribourg, Vatican officials accused Weakland of
``causing confusion among the faithful'' concerning abortion.
   Weakland held six hearings this year for women in the Milwaukee
Archdiocese, then issued a letter criticizing tactics of some
anti-abortion protesters as demeaning and lacking compassion.
   The letter also said people who call themselves ``pro-choice''
should not necessarily be considered pro-abortion.
   Weakland said he considered the Vatican's actions confusing and
has written a letter asking for clarification.
   ``Everybody's shrugging their shoulders wondering what's going
on,'' he said.
   He added that he knows church leaders have warned that his views
``are not without theological implications.''
   ``It won't change my procedure, I'm sure, in dealing with any
topic,'' he said. ``I'm not concerned about that.''
   Weakland was to be one of of several honorary degree recipients
at the ceremonies this week. He was to be honored for authoring a
1986 U.S. bishops' letter on the economy and social justice. The
university canceled the awards ceremony rather than exclude him.

<HEAD>Policemen Killed in Gang Battle in Southern Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An intensifying gang war in southern Japan has
killed two undercover policemen and wounded a passerby, officials
said today.
   The two officers, shot Friday, were found in a car parked
outside a golf center in a quiet residential area on the outskirts
of Naha, on the island of Okinawa.
   The two policemen, who had been investigating a 3-month-old war
between two rival criminal gangs, were shot in the head and died
almost instantly, a police official said on condition of anonymity.
   During the gunbattle, Masako Sawada, 49, was injured in her left
leg by bullets that ripped through her car as she and her husband
drove through the quiet neighborhood.
   Police said the National Police Agency is sending its chief
investigator to the area to look into the murders. The Kyodo News
Service reported that Okinawa police have set up a 700-member squad
to investigate the murders.
   Police quoted witnesses as saying that two men, who appeared to
be members of the yakuza, Japan's underworld gangs, approached the
policemen's parked car and fired their guns at close range. They
shot at Mrs. Sawada's car while fleeing in another car.
   It was not immediately known if the suspected gang members meant
to kill the officers, or if they thought they were members of the
rival gang.
   Friday's murders were the latest in a gang war that has
smoldered since September, when a larger gang split into two
smaller groups after an internal dispute.
   Two gang members were shot and killed in October, and on
Thursday a 19-year-old high school student was shot to death.
Newspapers said the student was apparently mistaken for a gang
member.
   Police say that since September, there have been 28 incidents
involving gang shootings on Okinawa.
   Handguns are illegal in Japan, and though gangsters keep a high
profile, violent crimes are relatively rare.
   Police estimate there are nearly 90,000 gangsters in Japan. A
gang war in Tokyo drew heavy police and media attention earlier
this year.
   The total underworld income - mostly from the sale of drugs,
extortion and gambling - is believed to exceed $9 billion annually.

<HEAD>Gov't Says Salvadoran Rebels Shot Down Jet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In the first incident of its
kind in the 11-year-old civil war, the government says leftist
rebels shot down one of its war jets with a missile.
   The downing Friday, which killed the pilot and wounded another
crewman, came three days after the rebels launched an offensive
that has killed nearly 100 people.
   The rebels say their offensive was aimed at forcing the rightist
government of President Alfredo Cristiani back to the bargaining
table after a series of stalemated sessions.
   A government communique on Friday claimed that rebel use of
missiles in several attacks demonstrates that the rebels' past
participation in peace talks ``is purely tactical.''
   The fighter-bomber was shot down in eastern Usulatan province,
the communique said. It said the A-47 Dragonfly was struck by a
Soviet-designed missile at midday near Santa Elena, about 80 miles
east of San Salvador.
   Earlier, the armed forces press office had said the plane
crashed because of mechanical failure.
   It was the first time the government has said one of its
warplanes was downed by a missile in El Salvador's civil war, a
conflict that has cost at least 73,000 mostly civilian lives since
it began in 1979.
   The United Nations is mediating peace talks between the
government and the rebels. Five rounds of talks since May have
produced little progress.
   A bill passed recently by the U.S. Congress cut in half the $85
million in military aid that El Salvador receives annually
beginning in fiscal 1991.
   The legislation is aimed at forcing both sides to reach
agreement on ending the war. It stipulates that the aid could be
restored if the rebels launched an offensive that threatened to
overthrow the government, or be halted altogether if President
Cristiani's government refuses to negotiate.
   The government communique, broadcast Friday night, claimed the
missile was one of several supplied to the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front rebels - also known as FMLN - by the leftist
Sandinista government in neighboring Nicaragua before it
relinquished power April 25.
   Such weapons represent ``extremely dangerous acts that could
affect the political stability of the country,'' the communique
said, adding that the rebels have been employing the missiles ``for
the past 72 hours.''
   Earlier Friday, the government said the rebels agreed to end an
offensive they launched last Tuesday that killed at least 91
people. But a rebel spokesman denied it, and reports of new
fighting surfaced.
   According to government officials, the offensive has killed 39
soldiers, 44 rebels and eight civilians and wounded about 300
people.
   The guerrillas claimed over their radio station that the army
suffered 450 casualties, without saying how many were deaths.
   The foreign ministers of Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia, who
were meeting in Mexico City on Friday, appealed for an end to the
fighting and urged the two sides to cooperate with the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks.

   A big-rig truck careened into
stopped traffic, crumpling cars and flinging them aside in a fiery
nine-car chain collision that killed five people and injured 17.
   The truck driver jumped from the cab moments before it burst
into flames Friday morning, witnesses said. He was arrested to face
manslaughter charges, California Highway Patrol dispatcher Cathy
Cox said.
   ``He was traveling an unknown speed approaching stopped traffic
at a signal,'' she said. ``Due to his speed, he was unable to
stop.''
   A car knocked into a pole and a pickup truck launched into a
center divider carried the five people killed. The car became
pinned under the truck and was dragged as the rig plowed seven
other vehicles before coming to a halt and catching fire.
   The car and the pickup truck burned also. The empty grain truck
partially melted in the inferno that forced closure of a rural
stretch of Interstate 215 for nine hours.
   ``I don't know if the driver fell asleep or what,'' said
Charlene Phillips, 53, whose car suffered slight damage in the
pileup. ``I'm very, very lucky to be alive.''
   Injuries ranged from one man hospitalized in serious condition
to cuts and bruises. Moreno Valley is in Southern California about
65 miles east of Los Angeles.

   A ground control computer error prompted
the Magellan spacecraft to briefly halt its mapping expedition of
Venus, but NASA officials said the probe remained in contact with
Earth.
   The computer glitch occurred late Friday night. The
multimillion-dollar craft was expected to resume its charting
mission early today, NASA said in a statement.
   Magellan stopped mapping when an onboard computer detected
errors in commands being sent from ground control computers, NASA
said.
   It was the second report of problems with the craft's mapping
mission in eight days. The Magellan signal was lost for 40 minutes
on Nov. 15. Signals were lost twice in August.
   Flight controllers said some mapping orbits would be lost, but
the craft did not lose contact with Earth.
   Engineers have lost contact with Magellan three times for
reasons not yet fully understood, but believed to be electric
static interfering with a spacecraft computer.
   Magellan was launched from Space Shuttle Atlantis on May, 4,
1989. It went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally
started its $744 million mapping mission Sept. 15.
   Magellan uses radar to map terrain through thick clouds covering
Venus. It has sent back pictures of the planet's fractured volcanic
surface, revealing numerous lava flows, volcanoes, quake faults and
Los Angeles-sized meteorite impact craters.

<TEXT>
   Thanksgiving turkeys by the thousands were
dumped in a landfill after a man started a holiday scare with
claims he injected some of the birds with cyanide.
   Health officials said Friday they had received no reports of
poisonings, and police said they had no evidence that any turkeys
actually were laced with cyanide.
   The scare began the day before Thanksgiving when a man called
KOLD-TV newswoman Barbara Grijalva and said he had injected some
turkeys at Smith's Food and Drug stores in Tucson with cyanide.
   KOLD producer Rob Daniels said the caller said he ``had a
problem with Smith's'' and poisoned the turkeys to ``prove a
point.''
   ``It appears to be simply the work of a hoax of a very sick
person who either has a grudge to bear against Smith's or only
wished to cause a great deal of anguish among innocent people on
what should be one of our most joyous holidays,'' said Jeff Smith,
chairman of the store chain.
   Smith's offered refunds or exchanges to 4,050 people who
returned turkeys, some of which had been cooked. Employees pulled
another 550 birds from the shelves.
   Smith's spokesman Jim Acton said the scare could cost the chain
of stores as much as $200,000. Samples from several turkeys have
been turned over to the national Centers for Disease Control for
testing, he said.
   County health officials received no reports of people
complaining of symptoms associated with cyanide poisoning, said
James Robertson, environmental health director.

<HEAD>Official Says Circulation Of Bomb Photo Delayed Till After The
Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUMFRIES, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British authorities failed to
circulate photographs of a bomb in a cassette player before the
downing of Pan Am Flight 103 because of delay in reproducing the
pictures, an official says.
   Police believe a similar bomb blew up the Boeing 747 over
Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
   James Jack, aviation security director of the British Department
of Transport, also said Friday that nine security bulletins his
agency received before the bombing were not specific enough to
issue a major alert.
   Jack, speaking before an inquiry in the southern Scottish town
of Dumfries, said his agency received photographs of the cassette
player bomb 13 days before the bombing of Flight 103.
   But he said his agency failed to send the photographs to
airlines and security staff until 17 days after the downing because
of the time it took to reproduce them.
   ``I don't wish to divert responsibility for this matter. Perhaps
if I had attached an urgent label or taken them round to the
photographic department myself it would have been done in six
hours. But I put them into a process and unfortunately it was a
delayed one,'' he testified.
   Jack did not say who gave him the pictures. Families of victims
have said previously that the warning photos were distributed by
German authorities after German police discovered a bomb inside a
radio cassette recorder during a raid on suspected terrorists.
   Jack responded to the widow of one of the Flight 103 victims,
who inquired about nine security bulletins from governments,
airlines or security sources that were not circulated before the
bombing.
   ``That people have been arrested and a device has been
impounded, is that a threat? That there has been a report that
someone has perhaps tested procedure at an airline check-in desk,
is that a threat?'' he asked.
   ``That there is information that two terrorists are about in
Europe with a bomb, I hear about this frequently,'' he added
without elaborating.
   ``The judgment about whether these represent a threat and
certainly a specific threat is not as clear as you suggest,'' he
told Mrs. Elizabeth Delude-Dix, whose husband Peter died in the
bombing.
   Jack said that in 1988, he received reports of between 175 and
200 bomb threats against airlines operating flights from British
airports. Last year, the figure was about 300, he said.
   Relatives of some of the victims have alleged that authorities
failed to notify airline passengers about the pre-Lockerbie
warnings and that if they had done, people would not have flown in
Flight 103.
   Focused on the cause of the disaster, the inquiry opened last
month and is expected to last into next year. More testimony is
scheduled for Monday.
   Scottish investigators have said they are investigating several
radical Palestinian groups, but the inquiry is not considering
criminal responsibility.

   Snow fell in upstate New York and northern Michigan early today.
Skies were mostly clear elsewhere.
   Winds gusting to 100 mph knocked down power lines in Montana and
started brush fires that threatened homes, authorities said. High
winds also closed highways in western Washington and caused dust
storms in the eastern half of the state while rains posed a new
risk of flooding.
   The National Weather Service warned of possible floods today in
western Washington, but rain-swollen rivers were expected to drop
by Sunday as temperatures fall, the weather service said. Showers
were expected in western Montana.
   Low pressure bulding in Maine was expected to bring rain to much
of the state and snow in the mountains. Sunshine was the forecast
for the rest of the East, the South and the Midwest. Snow was
possible in northern Minnesota.
   Sunshine and warm temperatures were expected in the Rockies and
the Southwest.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 20s and 30s from Maine
to Montana, the 40s in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio Valley, the
50s across much of the Northeast, the 60s in the Midwest, Rockies
and Northern California, the 70s in the South and Southern
California and the 80s in the Southwest.
   The high temperature for the nation Friday was 87 degrees at
Brownsville, Texas.

<HEAD>Geneva Police Spokesman Says Bush Press Corps Was Rowdy, Not Swiss
Police</HEAD>

   A police spokesman today blamed members of the
White House press corps for scuffles in which Swiss security
officers jabbed a U.S. diplomat with a machine gun and roughed up a
news photographer.
   Swiss government officials could not immediately be reached for
comment on the incidents, which occurred during President Bush's
three-hour stop in Geneva on Friday.
   Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, citing ``brutal and vicious
treatment,'' said the United States planned to file a protest with
the Swiss government.
   U.S. officials told reporters on the presidential plane that
Swiss security officers shoved a machine gun into the stomach of
American chief of protocol Joseph Reed and roughed up a traveling
photographer of the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
   Geneva police spokesman Thierry Magnin today said an
investigation of the affair is under way. But he said some American
reporters ``behaved in a deplorable, inadmissible way.
   ``They did not respect security measures taken by Geneva police
... or Swiss territorial sovereignty, he said in a telephone
interview.
   ``There certainly was a row and heated words, but this was to
enforce security measures ... taken in accord with the American
security services,'' Magnin said.
   One police officer at Geneva airport Friday night said the White
House press corps behaved like ``occupying troops.''
   Magnin said he could not comment on the machine gun incident.
``But if it happened, the submachine gun certainly was not pointed
at the diplomat,'' he added.
   He said the police were simply doing their job and noted they
have long experience with dignitaries coming through Geneva.
   ``There's no misconduct. On the contrary, they did their job
well,'' he said.
   Tension between the White House party and Swiss security flared
already at Bush's arrival for a hastily arranged meeting with
Syria's President Hafez Assad.
   White House pool reporters, who arrived on a separate chartered
plane, called the arrival ``a complete zoo, with Swiss officials
winning the award as the worst hosts of the trip.''
   Security personnel prevented the Washington reporters from
getting close to Bush's plane when he arrived.
   A White House official said Swiss police, minutes before the
arrival, changed media coverage arrangements agreed earlier with
U.S. security officials.
   Magnin denied this, saying the arrangements had been clearly set
earlier in the day.

   As President Bush lobbies world leaders for
support of a U.N. resolution allowing the use of force in the
Persian Gulf, China still refuses to show its hand.
   As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China has
veto power and has refrained from using it on any of the 10
resolutions already in effect against Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   But China's consistent refusal to clarify its position on the
proposed U.N. resolution casts some doubt on the outcome of the
vote.
   Official reports today of a meeting between Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze, again failed to reveal how China would vote.
   The Soviet Union, also a permanent Security Council member, has
indicated support for the resolution.
   A joint statement released belatedly from the Friday meeting
said, ``Both sides stand for a political solution to the gulf
crisis on the basis of relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions
.... They strongly appeal to Iraq and demand that it withdraw its
army from Kuwait unconditionally and immediately.
   ``They hold that so far as there is still hope for a peaceful
solution, the international community should continue to work to
that end and try its best to avoid a war,'' it said.
   China has repeatedly avoided making clear how it will vote on
the use-of-force measure.
   During an eight-day tour of the Middle East this month, Qian did
not disclose China's intentions, and repeated questions to the
Chinese Foreign Ministry have been answered with the standard call
for a peaceful solution.
   By doing so, it has won praise and recouped international
prestige lost after Beijing's military crackdown on a massive
pro-democracy movement last year.
   Bush said Friday in Cairo he was confident the resolution would
be approved. He met with Arab leaders in th Middle East after
lobbying heads of state attending a 34-nation peace summit in Paris
earlier this week.
   China's most recent statement, made today by Qian's assistant,
Xu Dunxin, indicated that Bush's globetrotting efforts have not
impressed the Chinese.
   Xu, attending a conference on the Cambodia issue in Paris, said
that as long as a ``gleam of hope of peaceful solutions'' exists,
the international community should continue efforts for a peaceful
resolution, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

   Police today recovered a stolen truck
carrying an expensive nuclear medical device.
  The nuclear magnetic resonance machine was bound for a hospital
in Catania, Sicily, when a group of men forced the driver to stop
on an exit ramp near Catania on Friday and later left him on a
highway.
   The truck was found early today about 12 miles outside Catania.
Police said the nuclear device was untouched.
   The maker of the machine, NV Philips of the Netherlands, had
warned the device could have ``consequences for personal safety''
if tampered with.
   Local police speculated the thieves were ``ordinary
delinquents'' and were not seeking the device, which gives
X-ray-like images by monitoring protons and neutrons in the body.
   The machine usually costs more than $1.5 million.

   Homeless people who are that way because
they like a ``free and easy lifestyle'' could soon have the chance
to pitch tents on vacant lots turned into urban campsites, an
official said.
   Under a plan slated for City Council action in December or
January, authorities would provide bathrooms and supervise the
fenced camps 24 hours a day, City Manager Michael Brown said.
   The camps would be limited to groups of 25 people or fewer.
Drugs and alcohol would be banned.
   Brown said many of the city's approximately 1,200 homeless
people who don't want to change would benefit.
   ``They don't like shelters. They don't want remedial help. They
don't want a job or job training,'' Brown said. ``They want a free
and easy lifestyle and they would like a campground.''
   City staff will begin looking for available vacant lots soon and
once potential sites are found, the neighborhoods would be
canvassed to explain the program and allow residents to comment,
officials said.
   The city houses up to 220 street people nightly in shelters and
has an annual $600,000 budget for homeless services, said Eric
Landes-Brenman, Berkeley's homeless coordinator.

<HEAD>Draft of New Union Treaty Published in Soviet Press</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public got its first full look at President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans for sharing power with the 15 Soviet
republics today when major newspapers published a draft of his
proposed union treaty.
   The proposed treaty represented the central government's latest
attempt to appease secession movements by the republics and smaller
regions while creating a uniform, market-oriented economic system.
   At a news conference Friday night, Gorbachev warned that a
breakup of the Soviet Union could lead to ``bloodshed and civil
conflict'' and said he would use all his constitutional powers to
prevent it.
   Publication of the draft treaty gave the public its first
glimpse of the proposal in full, designed as a charter for a new
``Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics.''
   The draft has already been submitted to the Supreme Soviet
legislature and the parliaments of the republics.
   To date, all but one of the republics, Kirgizia, have declared
some form of sovereignty.
   The three Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - have
declared independence and say they will not sign a new union
treaty. But they say they are willing to reach political and
economic agreements with the Soviet Union and other republics.
   The legislature of a fourth republic, Georgia, on Friday
``uninamously enacted a law declaring a period of transition in the
republic pending the restoration of its complete national
independence and sovereignty,'' the newspaper Pravda reported
today.
   During the transition, Pravda said, ``the parliament of Georgia
regards the signing of a new union treaty as impossible.''
   At his news conference, Gorbachev made it clear that republics
wanting to leave the union must hold a referendum, as required
under existing Soviet law. He said he would oppose any other form
of dissolving the union.
   ``If someone tried to impose such a policy, it would result in
bloodshed and civil conflict, which would be unacceptable to the
world community,'' he said.
   Many of the treaty's points were unveiled by Gorbachev in the
Supreme Soviet last weekend, and legislators twice endorsed his
proposals to reorganize the central government to carry out the
treaty.
   The draft provides for establishing the Council of the
Federation, which would consist of a vice president, the first in
Soviet history, and heads of the republics.
   The council would ``determine the main directions of the union's
domestic and foreign policies,'' the Tass news agency said.
   The treaty also would create a presidential Cabinet, formed in
agreement between the president and the Surpeme Soviet, Tass said.
The Cabinet would replace the current Council of Ministers, headed
by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Under the draft treaty, each republic, ``as a sovereign state,
has full state powers over its territory. Treaty participants
regard the Soviet Union as a sovereign federative state formed as a
result of the republics' voluntary union.''
   Republics would ``independently determine their state structure,
administrative-territorial division and the system of the bodies of
power and administration,'' the draft says.
   In defining the sharing of power between the Kremlin and the
republics, the draft treaty proclaimed, ``the supremacy of republic
legislation over republics' territories on all questions, except
those which are referred to the jurisdiction of the union.''
   The central government would be empowered to adopt a new
constitution, protect the country's borders and ensure the state's
security. The Kremlin would continue to control the armed forces
and be responsible for defense matters, the space program, railway,
air and sea travel, and the administration of the fuel and energy
system.
   The Kremlin would also determine the country's economic
development and ``the creation of conditions for the development of
the all-union market.''

   Iraq is still producing poison gas and
other military equipment with foreign help, despite the trade
sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the German newsmagazine
Der Spiegel reported today.
   Spiegel, quoting former German hostages recently released by
Iraq and intelligence sources, said Iraqi plants in Samarra were
producing 880 pounds daily of Tabun and Lost, two nerve gases.
   German and other Western experts were helping Iraq keep up
production at military facilities, including those where Western
hostages are being held as ``human shields'' to deter attack by
multinational forces, Spiegel said.
   Western experts and salesmen travel are still traveling to Iraq
via Amman, Jordan, to conclude lucrative military contracts, the
report said. They have been guaranteed unhindered travel out of
Iraq, Spiegel said.
   Spiegel's report was released to other news media in advance of
its publication on Monday.
   Iraq is known to have a large arsenal of chemical weapons. In
previous reports, Spiegel has said that six poison gas factories in
Samarra, north of Baghdad, had been built with German help.
   The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo on Iraq in
response to Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. About 350,000
troops from 26 nations have been deployed in the gulf region to try
to force Iraq out of Kuwait.

   Amid charges that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
was undermined by her own party, an opinion poll released today
indicated three candidates for her job would bring the
Conservatives an election victory.
   Under Mrs. Thatcher's leadership, the governing party had
trailed Labor in opinion polls for 16 months. Labor is the main
opposition party in Parliament.
   But a poll of about 1,100 voters Friday found that more voters
preferred either former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine or
Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major, to Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd would put the Tories neck and
neck with Labor, with Hurd having a slight edge, according to the
poll, taken by ICM for the Sunday Correspondent newspaper. The poll
was published today.
   Forty-seven percent of people asked would vote for Heseltine,
compared with 38 percent who would vote Labor, according to the
poll of 1,139 people. Major received 46 percent of the vote,
compared with 39 percent for Labor, and Hurd had 43 percent of the
vote, compared with Labor's 41 percent, the poll showed.
   No margin of error was given. No poll can be 100 percent
accurate, however, and there is usually a margin of error of at
least two or three percentage points with a sample of that size,
poll watchers said.
   The 372 Conservative Party members of the House of Commons will
vote for a leader on Tuesday. If none of the three candidates
receives a majority, a third ballot will be held Thursday.
   Mrs. Thatcher resigned on Thursday, after it appeared she would
lose a Conservative Party leadership vote to Haseltine, who had
made a strong showing in a first round of leadership balloting last
Tuesday.
   Hurd and Major, Cabinet ministers no longer shackled by loyalty,
immediately jumped into the leadership contest with Heseltine.
   The latest poll is similar to the findings of a Harris poll
released Friday by Independent Television News that also predicted
an upturn in Conservative Party fortunes under a new prime
minister.
   That poll, of 1,107 voters on Thursday, found that the
Conservatives, with any of the three candidates as leader, would
beat Labor if a general election were held immediately. A general
election must be held before mid-1992.
   The poll found voters ranked the candidates in the same order -
with Heseltine leading Labor by 10 points, Major by seven points
and Hurd by four. No margin of error was given in the Harris poll.
   
   Supporters of the 65-year-old Mrs. Thatcher have angrily accused
Conservatives of what one called ``political matricide'' in forcing
her to quit after 15 years as party leader and 11{ years as prime
minister.
   High inflation, rising interest rates, an unpopular new tax and
her lone opposition among European Community leaders to financial
and political integration were among factors that undermined her
support.
   Cabinet colleagues and campaign managers told her she could not
muster enough support to win in further balloting next week.
   Her opponents in the party feared that under her continuing
leadership the Conservatives would lose to Labor at the next
general election. Labor has been in opposition since 1979.
   Conservative legislators returning home for the weekend were met
Friday by anger from grass-roots backers of Mrs. Thatcher.
   Peter Stainforth, local Conservative Party treasurer at
Stevenage, about 25 miles north of central London, reported
particular rancor over Sir Geoffrey Howe. The deputy prime minister
quit on Nov. 1 and bitterly attacked Mrs. Thatcher in a Commons
speech on Nov. 13.
   ``I cannot express how the constituency feels about that
latter-day Brutus who was the first to plunge his dagger into his
leader's back,'' Stainforth said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush meets with Mexican President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Monday, intent on providing impetus
for what both countries hope will be a new era of cross-border
economic activity.
   High on the agenda for the sixth meeting between Bush and
Salinas in two years will be a proposed U.S.-Mexican free trade
agreement that would complement a similar pact the United States
reached with Canada in 1988.
   Bush and Salinas will meet in the northern Mexican city of
Monterrey where, aside from formal talks, time has been set aside
during Bush's 28-hour stay for a rodeo, abarbecue and a fireworks
display. Salinas also has an ancestral home nearby which Bush will
visit.
   Bush is plunging ahead with relish on the effort to forge a free
trade agreement, telling the Mexican news agency Notimex in an
interview published Thursday, ``We want to do it as soon as
possible.''
   During a June meeting in Washington, Bush and Salinas said a
free trade agreement (FTA) would be a ``powerful engine for
economic development, creating new jobs and opening new markets.''
   FTA advocates say a booming Mexico would slow illegal emigration
to the United States - estimated to be as much as 2 million entries
a year - and create a lucrative markets for U.S. exports.
   But critics warn that an FTA could touch off an exodus of jobs
from the United States to Mexico and its lower wage labor markets.
   Some in the administration predict a trade agreement could be in
hand within a year, while others are looking to 1992 as a more
likely timetable.
   Unless Congress rules otherwise, formal talks on transforming
economic ties along the 2,000-mile border will get under way in the
spring.
   The Monterrey talks also will touch on U.S. concerns about a
dramatic upswing in transshipments of Colombian cocaine through
Mexico. Mexico continues to be the largest foreign source of
marijuana sold in the United States and one of the largest sources
of heroin.
   However, a new State Department report says there has been a
significant increase in drug enforcement activities by Mexican
authorities over the past two years. Although corruption continues
to be a problem, the report says Mexico has seized record amounts
of drugs in the two-year period.
   But the prospective trade agreement will be the main topic at
the Monterrey talks.
   The concept has been endorsed by private groups such as the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, the Bilateral Commission on the Future of
U.S.-Mexican Relations and the Mexico-United States Institute.
   The benefits are obvious for Mexico, which sits adjacent to what
is perhaps the largest market in the world: 300 million mostly
prosperous Americans and Canadians.
   Salinas is banking on the notion that the rivers of technology
and investment which have bypassed Mexico over the years, going
instead to Asia and recently to Eastern Europe, will flow into his
country once a free trade area extending from the Yukon to the
Yucatan is in place.
   Particularly attractive to potential investors is the relatively
low wage scale Mexico offers compared with the United States and
Canada. As an example, a U.S. government study shows that the
average hourly wage at foreign operated assembly plants along the
Mexican side of the U.S. border is $1.63 compared with $14.32 in
the United States.
   Some in the United States warn that the American workers will be
big losers under an FTA.
   Rep. Don J. Pease, D-Ohio, a member of the House Ways and Means
Trade subcommittee, wonders whether an FTA will have a depressing
effect on U.S. wages.
   ``One certainly suspects so,'' Pease says. ``This is the kind of
issue that needs to be addressed extensively and soon.''

<HEAD>Deploying to Saudi Arabia: Only Slightly Less Daunting This Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it hauled a million tons of bullets and
beans to the Persian Gulf at the outset of Operation Desert Shield,
the Pentagon likened the task to moving a city the size of
Chattanooga, Tenn., halfway around the world.
   It's moving time again, but with a European twist.
   Half of all U.S. Army forces in Europe, with hundreds of 63-ton
battle tanks, artillery pieces, rocket launchers and tons of other
heavy equipment, are heading for the Saudi desert to reinforce the
230,000 U.S. troops there. The exact number of Army reinforcements
is secret but probably near 100,000.
   It ranks as the biggest U.S. military exodus from Europe since
the end of World War II.
   Some of the Army's Apache helicopters already have traveled the
Rhine River by barge to major ports in Belgium, Holland and Germany
where they are being loaded aboard ``fast sealift'' ships for a
nine-day voyage to the Arabian Peninsula.
   The troops will follow later, although departure dates have not
been set, said Sgt. J.D. Hardesty, a spokesman at U.S. Army Europe
headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany.
   They'll be joined by more than 20,000 Navy sailors now gearing
up to steam to the gulf, 45,000 Marines from across the United
States, at least 16,500 members of the Army's ``Big Red One'' 1st
Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Riley, Kan., and thousands
of military reservists called up to support the new deployments.
   It's a logistical challenge on a scale topped only by the first
wave of American deployments to the gulf, which itself was the
largest short-notice military airlift and sealift in American
history, according to the Defense Department. The first wave of
Desert Shield deployments all started from the United States.
   This time the job should be less daunting, because of the
benefit of lessons learned from the first go-round and because of
the shorter distance the heavy armored units in Europe and their
supplies will have to travel.
   And because a large defensive U.S. force already is in Saudi
Arabia, speed of transport is less critical than in the early
stages of the crisis, when U.S. officials feared that Iraqi forces
might make a run at the Saudi oil fields. So equipment this time
can be moved entirely by sea rather than rushed by air.
   On the other hand, the task is complicated by the fact that it
must take place at the same time spare parts and other supplies are
flowing into the gulf for the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine
Corps units already deployed there.
   President Bush's decision in August to send U.S. troops to the
gulf caught military logistics planners off guard. And while few
people foresaw that Bush on Nov. 8 would order as many as 200,000
additional troops to go, the transportation commands say they were
ready.
   ``Sealift ships began moving toward loading ports within hours
of the president's announcement,'' said a Military Sealift Command
official who asked not to be identified. ``We are not beginning the
second lift from a standing start.''
   Tricia Larson, a Sealift Command spokeswoman, said about 160
sealift ships are operating now, including seven ``fast sealift''
vessels that can travel at 33 knots, and 41 slower cargo ships
activated from the Ready Reserve Fleet, a sort of 96-ship
navy-in-waiting that is used in emergencies.
   The Pentagon also has been forced to charter 59 cargo ships, of
which 45 are flying foreign flags, and 22 petroleum tankers, of
which five are foreign-flagged, Ms. Larson said.
   The Marine Corps is mobilizing Marine Prepositioning Ship
Squadron 1 from Norfolk, Va. The unit consists of five ships that
carry tanks, trucks, armored vehicles, fuel, food and other
supplies to keep 16,500 Marines combat ready for 30 days.
   Most U.S. troops will be flown to Saudi Arabia by commercial
airliners, as happened during the initial buildup when, for the
first time ever, the U.S. Transportation Command mobilized the
Civil Reserve Air Fleet. That in effect meant the Pentagon
commandeered a fleet of 29 U.S. commercial airliners for its own
use.
   Sgt. Scott Leas, a spokesman for the Military Airlift Command at
Scott Air Force Base, Ill., said the commercial aircraft are still
at the Pentagon's disposal. He said it was too early to say whether
extra commercial jets would be needed.
   ``It's all in the planning stage,'' he said.
   The Military Airlift Command is expected to use most of its
fleet of military cargo planes, which includes 127 C-5 Galaxies for
large and heavy cargo, 266 C-141 Starlifters for less bulky,
lighter-weight vehicles and equipment and 660 smaller C-130
Hercules.

   Pope John Paul II on Saturday said the

hopeful the church can achieve full freedom in the Communist
country.
   ``In a climate of mutual respect, understanding and good will, a
dialogue has begun which augurs well for the future,'' the pope
said in a speech to 21 visiting Vietnamese bishops.
   John Paul said he based his assessment on the results of a visit
to Vietnam earlier this month by an official Vatican delegation.
Cardinal Roger Etchegary, head of the Vatican's Justice and Peace
Commission, held talks with officials in Hanoi and elsewhere on
church-state issues.
   ``The road will still be long and the difficulties will not be
lacking, but it seems that it is the right path,'' the pope said in
French. ``I hope that in the near future the Vietnamese church
finds that the place which it deserves in society is ever more
recognized.''
   ``Be assured,'' he told the bishops, ``that the Holy See will do
all in its power so that these first steps in dialogue can lead to
an understanding which brings lasting fruit for the good of the
church of Vietnam.''
   There are an estimated 4 to 5 million Catholics among Vietnam's
largely Buddhist population of 63 million.
   While restrictions on Catholics and other believers have eased
in recent years, several problems with the Vatican remain. One
major issue is the appointment of archbishops for vacant posts in
Hanoi, Hue and Ho Chi Minh City.
   In his address to the pope, the head of the Vietnamese bishops'
conference lamented that bishops are lacking in five dioceses and
that there are virtually no priests in northern Vietnam.
   Monsignor Paul Marie Nguyen Minh Nhat, bishop of Xuan Loc in
southern Vietnam, said authorities continue to restrict the number
of seminary students, the activities of religious congregations and
the availability of religious education.
   ``The difficulties are multiplying with time, as the needs of
the community increase and the missionary personnel decreases,'' he
said.
   The pope said the Vietnamese church is suffering from a shortage
of priests and an aging clergy. He said he hoped priestly
candidates finishing seminary studies ``will be able to be ordained
freely and begin their ministry as soon as possible.''
   According to a church report last year, only 15 priests have
been ordained since the communist takeover in 1975.
   John Paul noted that Vietnam has only four seminaries, with two
others scheduled to open soon.
   ``I fervently hope that no obstacle is put in the way and that
you can receive the candidates in these centers without any
limitation on their numbers,'' he said.
   Two years ago, the Hanoi government protested the pope's
canonization of 117 martyrs killed in Vietnam in the 18th and 19th
centuries.
   The pope said visiting bishops were in Rome to pay tribute to
the martyred saints.
   ``It is moving to think that you live your episcopal ministry
under the patronage of these saints,'' he said.

<HEAD>Diplomats Use Unseen `Ears' To Try To Raise Gulf War Fears</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western diplomats, acutely aware of hidden
microphones, are talking to the walls in Baghdad. They hope to send
the message that the threat of war is real and that the result will
be devastating.
   It's not that Iraq's leaders believe President Bush is bluffing,
the diplomats say. They recognize there's a danger of war. But they
remain confident they can outlast the threat, the sanctions and the
international coalition aligned against them.
   ``We're trying to convince them that it's real and imminent,'' a
Western diplomat said. ``We're trying to show them what they're
facing. We're walking around talking to the walls, telling them
about B-52 strikes.''
   ``We talk about our own fears and hope the message is passed
along'' to President Saddam Hussein's inner circle by the Iraqi
intelligence agencies bugging them.
   Saddam will not back down or withdraw from Kuwait as long as he
believes he can withstand the embargo, break the international will
behind it and forestall attack with clever hostage releases and
behind-the-scenes deals, the diplomats contend.
   The diplomats argue that Saddam now cannot afford to invade
Kuwait and then just cave in to international pressure.
   The Iraqi people are already questioning why they fought for
eight years with Iran only to give all the gains away after the
invasion of Kuwait.
   So, the diplomats say, he plays for time, dealing with hostages
and hinting to visiting delegations that perhaps, just perhaps,
there's a chance to talk, to negotiate.
   Iraq's plan to release all its hundreds of foreign hostages in
batches between Christmas and March 25 is cited as an example of
how Iraq believes it can forestall attack.
   Iraqi officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, candidly
admit that the threat of war is the highest between late December
and March and that the hostage release is a manuever to delay Bush
and weaken the American resolve to attack.
   The officials say they have tried other means, including
attempts to talk with the Americans through back channel diplomatic
contacts. But they say the Americans have never responded.
   People on the street in Baghdad seem less afraid of war then
they did in late August and September when the allied troop buildup
in Saudi Arabia was just beginning.
   ``There will be no war. America is a great country, a country
that cares for its people. It won't waste their lives in a war,''
said one Baghdad resident, who asked to be identified only as
Yousef.
   His sentiments were repeated often by other Iraqis and by some
Indian and Moroccan workers who have elected to stay at their jobs
in Iraq despite the crisis.
   Some Western diplomats say the public has been lulled to sleep
by the Iraqi propaganda machine that daily prints stories of
growing opposition to war in America and the West and growing world
support for Saddam and the cause of peace.
   But other diplomats say that many in Iraq, who have benefited
from some of Saddam's policies, are convinced he is a cunning and
clever man who will prevent the war and survive the crisis.
   ``This is a republic of fear, no doubt,'' said one Asian
diplomat. ``But it's also a country where the common man has
benefited greatly. It's not a pyramid standing only on fear of
Saddam Hussein.''
   Despite the economic sanctions - spot shortages of some goods
and soaring prices for others - many Iraqis believe the crisis is
only a short-term inconvienence.
   ``America will never go to war over Kuwait,'' said one Baghdad,
who gave his name as Ahmed. ``Why should it?''
   For the most part, it's business as usual in Iraq. There are
noisy wedding parties outside the big hotels and celebrations for
prisoners of war repatriated from Iran.
   ``They know Iraq is a potentially very rich country,'' the Asian
diplomat said. ``It's sitting on the world's second-largest
reserves of oil.''

   A senior Iraqi diplomat who allegedly
refused orders to return to Baghdad was found murdered in his car
outside the capital, officials said Saturday.
   Moayed Arab Nouri, consul at the Iraqi Embassy and considered
the No. 2 Iraqi diplomat in Rabat, was found dead in his car near
Mehdia-Plage, 18 miles north of the capital, according to the Saudi
Arabian newspaper Acarq al-Awsat.
   The report did not say when the killing took place.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the
report and said he died of blows from a blunt instrument. No
further information was immediately available.
   According to the Saudi newspaper, Nouri refused an order to
return to Baghdad and rented an apartment in the Moroccan capital,
where he had been living with his wife and three children. The
paper did not say when the diplomat was ordered home.
   Morocco has sided with fellow Arab nations such as Egypt, Syria
and Saudi Arabia, strongly condemning the Iraqi invasion and
annexation of Kuwait.

<HEAD>20th Anniversary of Celebrated Novelist's Spectacular Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after celebrated novelist Yukio
Mishima's spectacular hara-kiri, the dream of a resurgent Japanese
imperialism he died espousing seems as distant as ever.
   ``I can't think of a single lasting effect (his death) had,''
said Donald Richie, a cultural critic who has lived in Japan four
decades.
   Mishima, regarded as one of the leading Japanese authors of this
century, scandalized the nation when he committed ritual
disembowelment at a Tokyo military base Nov. 25, 1970, at age 45.
   Just minutes before his suicide, Mishima and four young members
of his small, private militia took a general hostage and demanded
that troops stationed at the base hastily assemble on the parade
ground.
   In a speech from a balcony parapet, he urged the soldiers to
arms to regain glory for the Japanese military and the emperor. He
also denounced the postwar constitution that renounces war and
limits the emperor's role to state symbol.
   Ending his failed, heckled speech with the cry, ``Long live the
emperor!'' Mishima hurried indoors, stripped to his loincloth and
plunged a foot-long dagger into his lower abdomen, cutting
crosswise. The horrific suicide ended when one of the youths
decapitated Mishima with a sword.
   Japan had hardly seen such ritual suicide since the immediate
aftermath of World War II, and there were immediate worries that
Mishima's actions could help revive the militarism that launched
the horrifying Pacific War.
   But his appeals went unheeded by all except a small fringe of
right-wing extremists. Today, the revived militarism he advocated
appears more unlikely than ever.
   The widespread opposition to a recent government proposal to
deploy troops overseas for the first time since World War II
``certainly suggests that his notions of re-establishing the
Imperial Army ... do not have popular support in the country,''
said J. Victor Koschmann, a visiting history professor at the
Stanford Center in Kyoto.
   The lukewarm public interest in this month's enthronement of
Emperor Akihito also indicates little support for reviving the
prewar status of monarch as a ``living god'' to be fanatically
worshipped.
   ``Other than a small fringe, for whom he's still a cult figure
of sorts, I just don't think (Mishima) has that broad an appeal,''
Koschmann said.
   The anniversary is passing mostly in embarrassed silence,
although one right-wing group will hold a rally Sunday to be
followed by a march through Tokyo to the base where Mishima
committed suicide. Only a few thousand are expected to attend.
   Some newspapers and magazines have carried articles and
photographs on Mishima in the days before the anniversary, and at
least six books on Mishima have been published recently.
   Mishima's novels, plays and short stories are known for
reflecting the conflict between the encroaching West and
traditional Japanese values, a conflict that Mishima felt intensely
himself.
   The works often reveal an obsession with beauty, death and
suicide.
   Among his best-known novels are ``Confessions of a Mask''
(1949), a partly autobiographical account of a boy's self-awakening
that includes themes of homosexuality found in many of Mishima's
later works. Another popular novel was ``The Temple of the Golden
Pavilion'' (1956), an examination of what led an ugly young monk
obsessed with the beauty of a Buddhist temple to burn it down.
   Mishima's works are widely studied among literature students at
Japanese universities.
   ``I think that people like Mishima because his novels create a
strong sense of Japanese traditional beauty,'' said Jiro Kawamura,
a literature professor at the Tokyo Metropolitan University.
   ``He is a very problematic, important novelist, but I don't
think he is a great novelist,'' said Kawamura. ``His work is full
of rhetoric. He is not a genius.''

   President Bush returned home today saying he is close to getting
the support he needs for U.N. approval of force against Iraq, while
Secretary of State James A. Baker III met on the gulf crisis with
officials in Colombia.
   In Beijing, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
said a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force to
Liberate Kuwait could be passed before the end of November.
   A day earlier, Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said
the U.N. Security Council probably would meet next week to discuss
the issue. It was the first indication enough support had been
gathered for the measure.
   The Soviet Union's U.N. envoy also said Friday Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze would attend a Security Council meeting next
week to discuss Iraqi aggression - and to issue a ``strong, serious
and precise warning'' to Baghdad.
   Saddam Hussein called on his war-hardened reservists to help
defend the emirate, which he invaded on Aug. 2 in a dispute over
oil, land and money.
   Bush and Baker have been lobbying world leaders on behalf of the
use-of-force measure. Baker made a four-hour visit today to Bogota,
Colombia, one of ten non-permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council.
   He was on the last leg of a five-day whirlind tour of Security
Council member states. But in meetings with Colombian President
Cesar Gaviria Trujillo and other officials, he failed to gain
support for a resolution on force.
   Colombian Foreign Minister Luis Jaramillo said Colombia has not
yet decided how it would vote in a resolution approving force.
   ``Finding peaceful solutions to conflicts is a fundamental
thesis within Colombia foreign policy,'' Jaramillo said at a joint
news conference with Baker.
   However, he said Colombia stands firm with the world community
in rejecting Iraqi aggression. Colombia has voted in favor of all
previous Security Council resolutions on Iraq.
   The Spanish foreign minister said he believed a resolution on
force would be passed by the end of November.
   ``I've always had the impression that it was possible such a
resolution would pass this month,'' Fernandez Ordonez said after
meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing Today. He made it clear,
however, that his view did not result from discussions with the
Chinese.
   China has refused to say how it would vote on a possible
resolution on military force. As one of the five permanent Security
Council members, China has veto power over resolutions. The other
permanent members are Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the
United States.
   But Bush said Friday he was confident he would get approval from
the 15-member Security Council.
   There had been reports of disagreement between Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev when they met earlier this week in
Paris. But Gorbachev denied that at a news conference Friday.
   ``I can tell you that meeting I had with President Bush only
reinforced our cooperation,'' he said. He repeated his call for the
Security Council to meet in the near future.
   In his latest meeting, Bush held talks in Geneva Friday with
Syrian President afez Assad. Assad declined to tell reporters
whether Syria would participate in any military offensive against
Iraq.
   Syria has sent some 7,500 ground troops to participate in the
multinational force against Iraq. It has promised 15,000.
   In Amman, Jordan, today the Parliament bitterly attacked
Washington for intervening in the Gulf crisis and condemned Saudi
Arabia for allowing Western troops on its soil.
   Pro-Iraqi sentiments run high in Jordan, which has a majority of
Palestinians. They view Saddam as leading the struggle to liberate
their homeland from Israeli occupation.
   About 26 nations have deployed some 350,000 troops in the gulf
region, including 250,000 U.S. personnel. They face an estimated
460,000 Iraqi troops stationed in Kuwait and southern iraq.
   The latest Iraqi call-up, announced in a Defense Ministry
communique broadcast on Baghdad radio, involves reservists in their
30s, including battle-tested veterans of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
   They apparently will be among 150,000 reservists and draftees
that Iraq said earlier this week would be sent to Kuwait, along
with about 100,000 other regular army troops.
   Since the Iraqi invasion, the United Nations has passed 10
resolutions against Baghdad, including a global trade embargo.
   Britain's Hurd told reporters in London that ``Soon, probably
next week, the Security Council will consider a draft resolution
authorizing member states to use force to bring about the reversal
of the Iraqi aggression.''
   The Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuliy M. Vorontsov,
also said the Security Council would meet next week to discuss
Iraqi aggression, but did not specify whether the measure on force
would be discussed. He said Shevardnadze would attend.
   The urgency is in part because Yemen, which has tilted toward
Iraq in the past, takes over the rotating chairmanship of the
Security Council from the United States in December.

<HEAD>Statement From Aide Says DeConcini Referred to Memo in 1987
Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Sen. Dennis DeConcini met with the
nation's top thrift regulator in 1987, he made references to a memo
that proposed a deal favorable to S&amp;L owner Charles H. Keating Jr.,
according to a sworn statement before the Senate Ethics Committee.
   The question of whether the Arizona Democrat actually offered a
deal on Keating's behalf is crucial to the ethics investigation of
DeConcini and four Senate colleagues.
   DeConcini has repeatedly denied making such an offer. The sworn
statement, given by someone who did not attend the 1987 meeting,
says only that DeConcini made ``verbal references'' to a memo
outlining a proposal for Keating.
   The ethics committee is trying to determine whether the
so-called ``Keating Five'' improperly pressured S&amp;L regulators on
behalf of Keating - a major political donor. The other senators are
John McCain, R-Ariz., Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., Alan Cranston,
D-Calif. and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   The sworn statement was given to the committee last August by
Glenn's administrative assistant, Mary Jane Veno, and released last
week.
   According to the affidavit, Ms. Veno told the committee what she
learned from DeConcini's administrative assistant about the April
2, 1987 meeting between four senators (all except Riegle) and top
regulator Edwin J. Gray.
   No Senate staffers attended the meeting. Ms. Veno said she was
told about the memo by Gene Karp, who said Friday that his
recollection of their conversation differs from hers.
   The 1987 meeting is important because Gray insists that
DeConcini then offered a quid pro quo on Keating's behalf.
   Gray said an essential part of the offer was that Keating's
Lincoln Savings and Loan would offer more home mortgages if
regulators would exempt Lincoln from a rule limiting risky
investments.
   Committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett said in his opening
statement the evidence shows that DeConcini offered the deal.
   But DeConcini has denied it in the strongest possible terms. And
Cranston, Glenn and McCain back him on that point.
   In the sworn statement, Ms. Veno said that some time after
allegations of a deal for Keating became public in late 1989, Karp
called her at home. He ``explained that Sen. DeConcini had brought
the memorandum with him to the April 2 meeting, and during the
meeting, had made verbal references to the subjects discussed in
the memorandum,'' she told the committee.
   The memorandum, dated March 19, 1987, was from DeConcini staffer
Laurie A. Sedlmayr to her boss. It detailed ``What American
Continental (Lincoln's parent company) wants from Gray for
concessions'' and ``What American Continental is willing to do.''
   Ms. Sedlmayr is scheduled to testify Monday when the committee
resumes its hearings.
   Karp said Friday that since the 1987 meeting was held in
DeConcini's office, the memo was available to the senator. But Karp
said he did not know if DeConcini actually referred to it.
   In an interview, Karp said he could not recall exactly what he
told Ms. Veno, but ``as I remember it now, Gray said at the very
beginning he didn't know anything about Lincoln and DeConcini never
got into the subject matter of the investigation or anything about
that. Whether there was any specific reference made, I can't
answer. Only the principals that were there can answer it.''
   Karp added that he does not recall telling Ms. Veno that
DeConcini made ``verbl references'' to the memo and ``I find it
difficult to imagine that I said that.''
   Ms. Veno could not be reached for comment on her statement or
Karp's.
   The aides received information on the meetings from the
senators, but had no firsthand knowledge, since only the four
senators and Gray were in the room and no transcript of the session
exists.
   Ms. Veno also said in her statement that when she queried Glenn
about the April 2 meeting, the senator said he ``did not recall
Sen. DeConcini making such statements (about a deal) nor did he
believe such statements were made.''
   But she added that Glenn also ``said it was possible that Sen.
DeConcini raised this issue in his opening remarks at the meeting,
and that Sen. Glenn was not focusing on Sen. DeConcini's comments
at the time.''
   The purpose of the fact-finding hearings, which began Nov. 15,
is to decide whether any of the five senators improperly pressured
regulators on behalf of Keating, who along with associates
contributed $1.3 million to their campaigns and causes.
   Much of the money was donated while the businessman was fighting
regulators during their intense investigation of Lincoln, the
Irvine, Calif. thrift that was seized by the government in April
1989 at a potential bailout cost to taxpayers of more than $2
billion.

<HEAD>Sketches Of The Main Candidates in Poland Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are sketches of the main candidates
in Poland's first direct democratic presidential election Sunday:
   ---
   LECH WALESA&equals;
   The 47-year-old with an astonishing mix of political instinct
and personal charisma has arguably done more than any other
individual to topple Communism and says the presidency is his next
responsiblity. He contends even more must be reformed if Poland is
to become a true democracy.
   Born to a dirt-poor farm family in a remote hamlet, Walesa had a
trade-school education when he drifted to the Baltic port of Gdansk
and took a job at the Lenin shipyard in 1967.
   Increasingly incensed by the workers' lot and dispiriting
totalitarian rule - especially after the bloody repression of
strikes in 1970 - Walesa lost one job after another to his
activism. He was unemployed and outside the strikebound shipyard
when he made his famous leap over the gate to lead Solidarity's
founding in 1980.
   Interned after martial law in December 1981 and awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1983, Walesa maneuvered the Solidarity
movement through years of repression to its takeover of the
government in 1989.
   After creating the Solidarity government, against dubious
colleagues' advice, Walesa found himself on the political sidelines
in Gdansk but increasingly alarmed by social discontent, apathy and
disaffection with the new government.
   He can be autocratic and contradictory - demagogic,
irresponsible and uncultured to his critics - but the Walesa of the
twinkling eyes, mesmerizing speech, to-the-people style and
enormous courage still holds immense sway.
   ---
   TADEUSZ MAZOWIECKI&equals;
   The 63-year-old prime minister became Eastern Europe's first
non-Communist government leader in August 1989, launched the
region's most dramatic economic overhaul on Jan. 1, and says Poland
needs his team to stay and finish the job.
   Mazowiecki's devout Catholicism led him to oppose the
then-Communist government. During the 1950s, he founded the
influential Club of Catholic Intellectuals in Warsaw and the
monthly magazine, Wiez.
   In 1961, he joined the parliament delegation of ZNAK, a tiny
officially condoned independent group protected by the church. But
eventually his principles clashed with the Communists' bounds of
tolerance. After he demanded an investigation into the 1970
killings of strikeing workers, he was barred from re-election.
   Mazowiecki joined Walesa in the founding days of Solidarity in
August 1980. He brought a letter of support from intellectuals to
the strikebound Gdansk shipyard, and stayed. Imprisoned during
martial law, the taciturn lawyer negotiated with Communists in 1989
at historic talks and submitted the court motion winning back
Solidarity's legal status.
   Proposed for prime minister by Walesa, Mazowiecki has become
increasingly confident - though never comfortable - under the
international spotlight. But the two split, along with the
once-united Solidarity movement, over the whether Mazowiecki's
deliberate, reasoned course to reform is too slow.
   ---
   STANISLAW TYMINSKI&equals;
   The virtually unknown 42-year-old emigre with Polish, Canadian
and Peruvian citizenship grabbed the spotlight late in the campaign
when one poll showed him in second place, trailing only Walesa.
   Tyminski says he left Poland penniless 21 years ago, going first
to Sweden as a tourist and then emigrating to Canada, where he
became a millionaire. He started a cable television outfit and a
restaurant in the Amazon port of Iquitos, Peru, and then returned
to Canada, where he runs Transduction Ltd., a computer automation
firm near Toronto. He leads the Libertarian Party of Canada, a
fringe party that has no representative in parliament.
   Tyminski, financing his own campaign, attracted supporters
disenchanted with Poland's drastic economic reforms who responded
to his harsh criticism of the government. But his credentials went
largely unchallenged until his surge in the polls. Then journalists
started to question his long absence from Poland and state
prosecutors launched a slander investigation after he accused
Mazowiecki of treason against the nation.

   President Bush, expressing growing impatience,
appears grimly determined to show he is willing to go to war
against Iraq to end its takeover of Kuwait.
   The resounding message of Bush's just-concluded trip through
Europe and the Middle East was that time is running out for a
peaceful retreat by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   For the first time, Bush raised the possibility of setting a
deadline for Baghdad.
   He also spoke bluntly of ``a commitment to use force.'' And he
offered a chilling justification for amassing military forces
against Iraq, warning that Saddam was moving closer to building an
arsenal of nuclear weapons.
   ``The world is getting tired of this,'' Bush declared of Iraq's
nearly four-month occupation of Kuwait.
   Bush's theme was that he hopes for a peaceful resolution but is
laying the foundation for possible war. He said he was not
bluffing.
   Prodded by the United States, the United Nations Security
Council is expected to meet within days on a measure authorizing
force to remove Iraq.
   Bush said the United States is very close to winning U.N.
approval. Even without it, he said, ``We have the authority to do
what we have to do.''
   Congress was uneasy about Bush's saber-rattling before his trip,
and the hardening of his rhetoric is sure to raise new concerns.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he would urge
Congress to reconvene immediately if the United Nations endorsed a
resolution on force. He said he hoped Congress also would endorse
force.
   Bush made the Persian Gulf crisis the constant centerpiece of
his eight-day trip to Czechoslovakia, Germany, a 34-nation summit
in Paris, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
   ``We're not walking away until our mission is done, until the
invader is out of Kuwait,'' Bush told Marines and British ``Desert
Rats'' during a Thanksgiving Day visit to a remote desert outpost
in Saudi Arabia. ``And that may be where you come in.''
   The 230,000 American troops in the Persian Gulf, and 200,000
more on the way, give real credence to the president's implied
threat.
   Yet, despite Bush's resolve, there are signs of wear in the
global coalition against Iraq and there is reluctance - or mixed
signals - from some nations about the military option.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev counseled patience to
allow diplomacy to work. So did German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
warning of the consequences of war.
   On the other hand, Margaret Thatcher ordered 14,000 more British
troops to the gulf even as she announced her resignation as prime
minister.
   Bush got public backing from Egypt and Saudi Arabia for using
force, and Syria agreed that Iraq's aggression must not stand.
However, there were divisions in the Arab world.
   Yemen, which will assume the rotating chairmanship of the
Security Council in December, criticized the military buildup in
the gulf and refused to endorse tougher action.
   Yemen's attitude is a key reason why Bush wants U.N. action
before the end of the month when the United States has to
relinquish the council chairmanship.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who has circled the globe
in recent days lobbying for tougher action, cautioned against ``the
siren song of partial solutions.''
   And Baker said disapprovingly that some nations are beginning to
talk of allowing Iraq to hold on to disputed islands in the gulf or
be granted access to the gulf.
   ``So-called partial solutions are out of the question,'' Bush
declared.
   Stopping in Cairo, Bush vowed, ``We're going to pull this
coalition together. We're going to keep this coalition together and
we're going to see what happens.''
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, known for his caution, spoke
gloomily about prospects for a peaceful ending. ``I am
pessimistic,'' he said. ``I don't see the slightest movement'' by
Saddam.
   If he needed it, Bush got encouragement for quick action from
some of the American troops he visited in Saudi Arabia and aboard
the amphibious assault ship USS Nassau in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We either want to fight or we want to go home,'' said Marine
Lance Cpl. David Kimmel of Jonestown, Pa.
   ``I wish it would happen because I'm tired of being here,''
agreed Lance Cpl. Doug Mitchell of Hattiesburg, Miss.
   Troy Knapp, a 19-year-old corporal from Denver, said he thought
Bush was looking for a military solution. ``You're going to wonder
if he'll take the political heat for keeping the troops here for
another five months,'' Knapp said.
   Bush told the troops: ``No American will be kept in the gulf a
single day longer than necessary, but we won't pull punches. We are
not here on some exercise. ... This is a real world situation.''
   Bush has refused to specify how long he'll wait for sanctions to
work against Iraq. But he said that at the United Nations, ``We'll
be discussing not only the need to consider further action, but
perhaps a time frame.''

<HEAD>Northwest Flight Attendants Offered Free Flights for Not Calling

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines is offering flight
attendants two free first-class tickets anywhere in the world for
reporting as scheduled for holiday duty. It's an attempt to cut
down on sick calls over the holidays.
   In a recent letter to workers, Northwest in-flight services
chief Lloyd Warren thanked flight attendants in advance for
reporting for holiday duty.
   And as ``a token of our thanks,'' Warren said, two free
round-trip tickets in first-class seating would be given to flight
attendants who report as scheduled between Dec. 15 and Jan. 1.
   Northwest employs more than 8,000 flight attendants. To qualify,
workers must be scheduled for flights on Dec. 24, Dec. 25, Dec. 31
or Jan. 1. Service charges that normally accompany worker
flight-pass privileges would be waived.
   Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said that last year, flight
attendants were offered a $100 cash bonus for working through the
holidays.
   Miller said the offer does not reflect a problem with holiday
sick leave in the ranks of flight attendants.
   ``It's just that when we're in crunch time like we are around
the holidays, every single person is key to our success,'' he said.

   A land mine thought to have been planted
by Sikh extremists exploded Saturday under a police jeep in Punjab,
killing five policemen, a district official said.
   In another attack in the same district, Sikh gunmen herded five
Hindus out of their homes shortly before midnight Friday and shot
them outside their village, senior superintendent of police
Narinder Pal Singh said.
   Sikh militants fighting for a separate nation in Punjab have
killed about 2,930 people so far this year in the rich farming
state on the Pakistani border.
   Singh said a land mine exploded Saturday morning as a police
patrol traveled in three jeeps in Tarn Taran, 15 miles south of
Amritsar.
   Police Superintendent Harjit Singh, his driver and three
bodyguards were fatally wounded in the explosion, according to
Narinder Pal Singh, who is in charge of the Tarn Taran district.
   In Patti, 25 miles south of Amritsar, eight or nine Sikh
militants ordered five Hindus out of their homes at gunpoint late
Friday night and forced them to walk to the edge of the village
where they killed them, Singh said.
   All five were Hindus, he said. Four were shopkeepers, and the
fifth was a member of the Home Guard, a local defense force.
   Sikh militants launched their violent campaign in 1982, saying
they needed a separate nation for members of their faith. Sikhs
have a slight majority over Hindus in Punjab, but nationwide they
comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million people.
   The militants accuse Hindus, who make up 82 percent of the
national population, of discriminating against them economically
and politically.
   Amritsar, home of the Golden Temple, the Sikh's holiest shrine,
is in Amritsar. The Sikh faith has roots in both Hinduism and
Islam.

   Services will be held Monday at Howard
University for Dr. William Montague Cobb, a past president of the
NAACP and long-time professor of anatomy who boasted of having
helped train more than 6,000 physicians.
   Cobb had served on the faculty of Howard University's medical
school faculty for more than four decades beginning in 1928.
   Cobb had been suffering from heart problems and pneumonia when
he died at the age of 86 at George Washington University Hospital
on Nov. 20.
   He was a member of the board of directors of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People for more than 30
years and served as president from 1976 to 1982. He also served as
president of the National Medical Association, the leading
organization of black physicians, and was editor of its journal
from 1949 to 1977.
   An amateur violinist and historian, Cobb wrote more than 600
scientific papers in a career that saw service on many scientific
and governmental committees.
   Cobb, who was born in Washington, D.C., once told an
interviewer: ``I'm just Monty Cobb, the printer's son.''
   Showing early academic promise, Cobb attended Amherst College on
a scholarship. He then graduated from Howard University Medical
School and received a doctorate in anatomy at Case Western Reserve
University before joining the Howard faculty.
   Cobb resigned as chairman of the anatomy department in 1969 amid
pressure from students, who objected to what they called the
old-fashioned teaching methods at the medical school, and retired
in 1973.
   Cobb is survived by two children and four grandchildren. His
wife of 47 years, Hilda, died in 1976.

   Suddenly, it all looks gray. The prime minister
who told Britons not to be ``moaning Minnies;'' who bustled around
the globe, handbag at the ready; who stamped her authority on this
nation as no other leader since Winston Churchill, is finished.
   Margaret Thatcher went as she came, eyes ablaze in the House of
Commons, seeking no sympathy and admitting no error though she had
been overthrown by her own Conservative Party.
   Some loyalists, and some who had abandoned her, were near tears.
But she didn't flinch as she headed into the House of Commons to
defend her record against an opposition no-confidence motion just
hours after admitting defeat.
   ``I'm enjoying this!'' she shouted during one raucous
interruption.
   Style was part of the substance of Margaret Thatcher, who
imposed her personality on Britain for more than 11 years. It was
her great strength, and ultimately her tragic flaw.
   ``Fifty percent of Thatcherism was this extraordinary style,
this character, this abrasion,'' said biographer Hugo Young. ``The
power of a person to dominate events and the way we see them, to
dominate our conversations and to make politics part of the saloon
bar and drawing room life of Britain.''
   Challenged for the leadership and forced into a runoff the party
elders said she'd lose, Mrs. Thatcher withdrew Thursday.
   When the new leader of the party and the government is chosen
this week by Conservative legislators, it will be the end of the
Thatcher era.
   In the end it came over Europe. In part it was her total
resistance to a single European currency, as opposed to the
near-total resistance of most of the British Cabinet, that did it.
   But mainly it was style: dismissing proposals for political
unity at a European Commuinity summit in Rome last month as a
``ragbag,'' then turning on her resentful, long-suffering deputy,
Sir Geoffrey Howe, at a Cabinet meeting.
   That was the last straw for Howe, who resigned and then
unburdened himself in a savage resignation speech. He had
despaired, he said, of working for a woman who pursued a running
argument with the official line of her own government.
   Margaret Thatcher simply couldn't play along with her European
partners on their wide-ranging but still vague proposals and wait,
as she insisted they would, for things to fall apart in
negotiations. ``That's not my style,'' she snapped at a questioner.
   Ten years ago, she talked about the rush of adrenalin that came
in a really good fight: ``I stand there and I know, `Now come on,
Maggie, you are wholly on your own. No one can help you.' And I
love it.''
   Her ways were often reated as being peculiarly feminine, and
``a handbagging'' became the cliche for one of her rages.
   ``Most women defend themselves,'' she said on her 10th
anniversary in power. ``It is the female of the species. It is the
tigress and the lioness in you which tends to defend when
attacked.''
   At summits, foreign reporters packed her news conferences. She
always had something to say, and cut right through the diplomatic
parlance, the big words and the hazy evasions.
   She may have been more popular abroad than at home.
   During Thursday's session of the House of Commons, a Tory
lawmaker said an American popularity poll had showed Mikhail
Gorbachev at 74 percent, George Bush at 75 percent and Mrs.
Thatcher at 94 percent.
   ``I am sure that they were quite right, too,'' she said.
   She was mobbed in Leninikan in Soviet Armenia in June when she
came to inspect earthquake relief efforts. Children threw
carnations and shouted, ``We love you!''
   She seemed on a permanent crusade, whether facing down the labor
unions or attending a cocktail party.
   ``You have to put her in the same category as Bloody Mary, Queen
Elizabeth I, Queen Anne and Queen Victoria,'' said Lord Hailsham,
who served in Thatcher Cabinets from 1979-87 before retiring as
lord chancellor, the nation's top legal officer.
   ``Her handling of men is not dissimilar. If you had been a
courtier of Elizabeth I, you would never quite know whether you
were going to get the treatment of an admired friend, or a poke in
the eye with an umbrella.''
   Like her friend Ronald Reagan, she was devoted to a few clear
ideas. But unlike him, she was seldom caught unprepared on the
details and intricacies of policy.
   She espoused what she called ``Victorian values,'' and her
lectures to the nation ranged from the evils of socialism to the
virtues of tidyness.
   Perhaps because of her, mused the Financial Times, Britain no
longer needs a strong leader. ``One must hope so,'' it added, ``for
it is most unlikely to enjoy such leadership again within a
generation. Here was a Thatcher; when comes such another?''

<HEAD>Kohl Ahead in First All-German Elections Since 1933</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose swift
unification of his country astonished fans and critics alike, seems
assured of victory in the first all-German elections since 1933.
   Opinion polls forecast an easy win for the chancellor Dec. 2
over Oskar Lafontaine and the Social Democrats.
   Lafontaine has ``made too many mistakes,'' especially in his
early reluctance to support reunification, and ``has little chance
of winning,'' said Dieter Roth of the Institute for Election
Analysis and Society Research in Mannheim.
   The Social Democratic leader argued Germany was moving too
rapidly for the country's good and, rightly as it is turning out,
that unification would cost more than predicted.
   In a new poll by the respected Allensbach Institute, Kohl's
conservative coalition won 53.7 percent approval, compared to 33.4
percent for the Social Democrats. Kohl led by 22 percent in a poll
based solely on the two men's personal appeal.
   At rallies, Kohl confidently predicts a bright future while
Lafontaine speaks of higher taxes and a total bill of up to $137
billion for bringing the former East Germany up to western
Germany's standards.
   Kohl made a campaign trip to eastern border city of Frankfurt an
der Oder, perhaps to remind voters that he and Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
prime minister of Poland, met there Nov. 8 and settled the
long-disputed boundary.
   More than 10,000 people filled the Bonn market square for an
evening rally and cheered when the chancellor walked into the crowd
to shake hands.
   In his speech, Kohl mentioned his success in uniting the country
and said: ``I need no lessons from that man from Saarbruecken,'' a
reference to Lafontaine.
   The challenger held his own rally in Bonn the next evening,
drawing a comparatively quiet crowd of of about 3,000.
   Lafontaine concedes he misjudged Kohl's ability to retain voter
loyalty despite the rapidly rising cost of unity.
   Violence has entered the campaign. Lafontaine and Interior
Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble were targets of assassination attempts.
   Forty parties are running candidates but only a few have a real
chance of winning seats in the Bundestag, as Germany calls its
parliament.
   Among the fringe groups are the Farmers' Party of former East
Germany; The Grey Ones, a party for senior citizens; the Women's
Party, and the xenophobic German National Democrats.
   The Greens, made up of leftists, feminists and ecologists, are
worried about losing their traditional audiences to mainstream
parties. Polls indicate some Greens support is straying, but not
enough to shut them out of the Bundestag.
   On the far right, the Republican Party had a meteoric rise for
two years but has lost ground to mainstream parties. Analysts do
not expect it to win the 5 percent of the vote needed to obtain
parliament seats.
   East Germany's renamed Communists are expected to get in, even
though they were caught sending party funds out of the country to
avoid seizure. The party is supported by many eastern Germans, but
has a negligible following in former West Germany.
   The Social Democrats claim Kohl is ill-equipped to clean up the
badly polluted environment in eastern Germany and is driving
Germany deeper into debt. Lafontaine has said for months that taxes
will have to go up.
   Kohl says unity will not require a tax increase, but that
improving and protecting the environment may. Germany's most
serious ecological problems are in the eastern regions.
   Social unrest in the east is growing with the unemployment
caused by reunification, and Kohl acknowledges unity will cost more
than he expected, but many voters have been turned off by
Lafontaine's campaign.
   Analysts cite his habit of criticizing Kohl's handling of
reunification without offering credible alternatives. Lafontaine
has said consistently that jobs must be protected in former East
Germany, for example, but has not said how he would do it.
   In Kohl's favor are forecasts even by pessimistic experts that
the eastern economy will start to turn around in 1991, bringing
millions of new jobs.
   Even though some of Lafontaine's warnings may bear fruit,
political analysts say, the public seems to trust Kohl to finish
the job he began.
   ``Pessimism can sometimes help win an election, but not when the
populace says there is no alternative'' to the existing course,
said Renate Koecher, a survey researcher at the Allensbach
institute.

<HEAD>Iraqi Opposition Weighs Prospects for Toppling Saddam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iraq's fractious opposition groups are
plotting ways to topple what they hope will be a weakened Saddam
Hussein if he survives an attack to force him to give up Kuwait.
   But some Middle East analysts believe that if the Iraqi dictator
is ousted or killed, Iraq would be plunged into chaos.
   Others believe that under international supervision, a
democratic government could be established to preserve order. Even
so, a crippled Iraq would face a period of turbulence.
   ``One may find that there's a vacuum at the center in Iraq,
which would lead to a breakdown of authority,'' said analyst Philip
Robins of London's Royal Institute of International Affairs.
   ``Total chaos could not be ruled out,'' he said. ``A lot depends
on how he goes and who perpetrates his demise.''
   Robins is among those who believe Saddam's ``most likely threat
would come from within his immediate circles, whether that be the
military or the intelligence apparatus or civilian circles.''
   Western analysts in Baghdad have said Iraq's army is showing
signs of disorder because of supply problems, purges of
high-ranking officers, sinking morale and desertions.
   Analysts familiar with Iraq's military machine said the recent
surprise replacement of the chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Nizar
al-Khazraji, indicated opposition to the strategy of holding onto
Kuwait.
   There is believed to be significant discontent because Saddam
conceded to Iran's demands for a final peace in their 1980-88 war.
Saddam made the concessions shortly after he invaded Kuwait on Aug.
2, and in effect relinquished gains made in the war with Iran.
   The new chief of staff, Gen. Hussein Rashid, was commander of
the elite Republican Guard. But some analysts believe even the
current situation might not be safe for Saddam.
   ``The rest of the army may be neutralized,'' said Bernard
Trainor, a former U.S. Marine general who has made several visits
to Iraq.
   ``But the Republican Guards could turn against him if he takes
them down the road to national suicide,'' said Trainor, now head of
the national security program at Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government.
   The Iraqi opposition groups operate outside the country, and
they are trying to prepare for the future even if there is no
military action.
   For more than a month, they've been meeting in Syria to
``reunite the Iraqi opposition, which might overthrow the Iraqi
regime even without war,'' said Mohammed Bakir Hakim, head of the
Tehran-based Iraqi Revolutionary Supreme Council, said.
   Syria, ruled by a wing of the Baath Socialist Party that has
long been at odds with rival Baathists in Baghdad, is sponsoring
the Damascus conference.
   Robins said the meeting underscores how the opposition groups
are trying to overcome differences.
   Still, ``there's little basis of support for any of the groups
in Iraq'' and no strong individual to fill Saddam's shoes, he said.
   The two dozen opposition groups fall into four major categories;
Arab nationalists, leftists, Kurds and Islamists.
   ``We want a democratic government, to have a free election, and
the Kurds should be represented in the government genuinely,'' said
Hoshyir Zebari, the London-based spokesman for the Kurdistan
Democratic Party. ``Most likely, you would find a coalition
government.''
   He said the West has been ambiguous in its strategy.
   ``Is it to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait? Or is it to depose
him?'' Zebari asked. He said that getting rid of Saddam ``is the
only way peace could prevail in the region.''
   President Bush strongly hinted last week during a visit to Saudi
Arabia that destroying Saddam's military might is his prime
objective.
   He told U.S. troops Thursday that their mission was marked by a
``real sense of urgency'' because of Iraq's drive to achieve
nuclear weapons capability. If that development were left
unchecked, Saddam would remain a great threat, Bush said.
   If Saddam goes, there is the danger of a clash between the
opposition groups, whose fractiousness has stopped them from
challenging Saddam's totalitarian rule.
   Some fear that the Kurds, who have been battling Baghdad for
decades for an autonomous homeland, would seek to establish an
independent state in Iraq's mountainous north.
   Zebari said, however: ``We'd have a genuine interest in
maintaining peace in the region ... and establish a genuine
democratic government.''
   The Islamic groups face the specter of Iran's late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini. His exhortations to Iraq's Shiite Moslem
majority during the 1980-88 war to rise up against Saddam did not
work.
   But suspicions linger that if Saddam were toppled, the Shiites,
some 55 percent of Iraq's 16 million people, might try to create an
Iranian-style Islamic republic in Iraq.

   Carol Schaljo says she's ``so healthy,
it's ridiculous.'' That's why her inability to get medical
insurance puzzled her.
   She wonders whether her work with AIDS Volunteers of Cincinnati
was the reason.
   ``The irony of this is I'm a health educator,'' said Ms.
Schaljo, 51. ``I educate the general community ... in the
prevention of coming in contact with and being infected by the HIV
virus.''
   Throughout the nation, medical professionals and volunteers who
work with people who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome or
carry the HIV virus are finding that along with the satisfaction of
serving those in need, they can face the animosity encountered by
their patients.
   ``I expect it a lot of times,'' said Katharine Whisnant, a
social worker with an Atlanta AIDS group whose relationship with a
boyfriend ended because he could not accept her work with AIDS
patients or her homosexual friends.
   She said the experience has made her reluctant to tell people
where she works or what she does. At a recent party, she tried to
avoid the issue.
   ``I thought, oh, I don't want to deal with it. So I just said I
was a social worker.''
   Carol Lynne Yarletts of the Columbus Health Department tackles
negative reactions to her occupation head-on.
   ``I figure I can either blow people away and tell them what I
do, or I can avoid the issue and say I am a nurse,'' she said.
``But my attitude is that for every one person you educate and give
them the facts, that could be five more people that they, in turn,
educate or correct their misunderstanding.''
   Public fear toward people who work with AIDS patients has eased
as general knowledge of the disease, which cannot be spread through
casual contact, has grown since the early 1980s, AIDS workers say.
   The growing awareness also has resulted in more volunteers'
becoming interested in AIDS-related work.
   Hospitals and other organizations that provide services to
people with the AIDS initially got as volunteers young, homosexual
white males who had lost someone to AIDS.
   Volunteer coordinators say that as the disease affected other
segments of the community, the people offering their services
became more diverse.
   ``People really have been falling all over themselves to become
part of the project,'' said Dennis Davis of the Jerusalem House in
Atlanta, which is home to five AIDS patients who otherwise would be
homeless.
   ``We see gay males and straights, young, old, black and white.
It's a very diverse group,'' Davis said.
   ``The challenge is getting the right people for the right
jobs,'' said Giulia Norton of the AIDS Action Committee in Boston.
``It's hard to get people who have the right skills or can work
during the day when we need them most.''
   Volunteers and medical professionals agree their work with AIDS
patients is stressful because of the inevitable - that their
patients will eventually die.
   No one has ever been cured of AIDS, which attacks the body's
immune system and leaves victims susceptible to a wide variety of
infections and cancers.
   In the back of their minds, too, is the fear they will contract
the disease through an accident.
   However, the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
knows of just 37 cases of the virus being transmitted to workers.
In all, the CDC says, there have been 154,917 cases reported in the
United States as of Oct. 31, and 95,774 people have died.
   The virus may be passed along when HIV-infected blood or
contaminated body fluids come into contact with an open wound or is
injected into the skin, according to the CDC.
   In a June 1989 report, the CDC said a person faces one chance in
200 of being infected by the HIV virus as a result of a single
contaminated needle puncture. No information was available on the
likelihood of infection after numerous needle injuries, the report
said.
   Despite the day-to-day pressures, AIDS workers say their
experiences have enriched their lives.
   ``It's hard work, it's depressing and painful, but what you get
back, it's tenfold,'' Ms. Whisnant said.
   ``I have turned down several jobs because I want to stay in this
job,'' said Rick Gower, an AIDS research associate at Ohio State
University. ``The reward is in being someone on the front line of

   Germany is ready to establish an
airlift to help transport food and other emergency supplies to the
Soviet Union, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The Welt am Sonntag newspaper, quoting unidentified ``reliable
sources'' in Bonn, said German air force transport planes would be
used if an airlift became necessary.
   The newspaper said ``government circles'' think U.S. Air Force
units stationed in Germany also could take part in a possible
airlift.
   The government is thinking about an operation similar to the
Allied airlift that brought tons of supplies to Berlin during the
Soviet blockade of the city from June 1948 to May 1949, the Sunday
newspaper said in a report that was distributed to other news media
in advance.
   There have been dire predictions of what the winter holds in
store for the Soviet people and fears that food shortages could
seriously exacerbate long-standing tensions and result in civil
unrest.
   Dieter Vogel, a government spokesman, said Friday that food
shipments and other aid to Moscow this year were absolutely
essential.
   The German view contrasted sharply with a U.S. assessment that
immediate food aid to the Soviet Union was unnecessary this year.
   Germany is sending a team of experts to Moscow next week to work
on resolving expected shortages.
   Welt am Sonntag said Germany was preparing the largest
government and private aid campaign since the end of World War II
to help the Soviets avert hunger this winter.
   Much of the aid is expected to come from emergency reserves of
food and other supplies built up in Berlin over the years to help
the city overcome another possible Cold War blockade, the newspaper
said.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
agreed during Gorbachev's visit to Germany earlier this month to
jointly sponsor the aid action.
   Gorbachev is very popular among Germans for having made
unification possible and several private relief agencies have
already started collecting food and other supplies to be sent to
the Soviet Union.
   ``CARE Germany'' said Saturday it is preparing packages of food
that will be sent to the Soviet Union before Christmas.
   A poll published by the Wickert Institute on Saturday said 89.4
percent of Germans were ready to make personal contributions to the
relief effort.
   Kohl has made help to the Soviet Union a major theme in recent
speeches and meetings with world leaders, particularly at this
week's 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Welt am Sonntag said Kohl will also raise the issue at the
European Economic Community summit in December in Rome.
   Kohl is facing national elections next Sunday and aid to the
Soviet Union has become one of the themes in the campaign.
   ``Such aid is a chance to establish and strengthen friendships.
A friend in need is the best friend,'' Kohl's chief of staff,
Rudolf Seiters, was quoted as saying in Welt am Sonntag.
   ``This is also help for ourselves...If the Soviet Union is
steering in the direction of democracy and market economy, then it
is a development that will benefit everyone in Europe.''
   Bonn has already promised $19.5 billion in various forms of aid
to the Soviet Union since Gorbachev lifted his objections to German
unification this summer.

<HEAD>Homicide Rate Tops Last Year's Record With One More Month To Go</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANITA WOMACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia has registered its
third consecutive annual homicide record even though police say a
major contributing factor, the percentage of drug-related killings,
is declining.
   The deaths of a 17-year-old student and two others Friday
boosted to 436 the number of killings in the nation's capital this
year. That is two more than in 1989.
   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood Jr., who has vowed to resign if the
murder rate doesn't come down, said his officers can't win the
battle alone.
   ``The community is still not angry enough about death and
violence on the streets of Washington, D.C. We have to get a lot
more angry about young people being killed,'' Fulwood said.
   After dropping from 200 murders in 1980 to 148 murders in 1985,
the number of homicides in the district soared - to a record 372
murders in 1988; and 434 last year.
   Police say there actually were 438 killings last year, but four
were listed as justifiable homicides. The number of justifiable
homicides has not been determined for this year.
   On a per-capita basis, Washington has led the nation in murders.
The city's image as a drug and murder capital was blamed for a
decline in tourism in 1989. Mayor Marion Barry's drug arrest and
conviction this year focused even more attention on the drug
problem.
   Police blamed the increased murder rate on an influx of crack
cocaine into the region in the mid-1980s. But statistics now
indicate that drugs are responsible for fewer killings than in
previous years.
   The proportion of slayings classified as drug-related has fallen
from 66 percent in 1988 to 52 percent last year to 39 percent this
year, according to police crime reports.
   Even so, drugs remain the single leading cause of murder in the
nation's capital.
   ``We'd like to stop these damned murders,'' said police
spokesman Lt. Reginald Smith said. ``But arrests alone are not the
only answer. The thing is to persuade people not to get involved in
drugs; not to fall to social ills that we have seen over the
years.''
   Smith said a sharp increase in domestic violence was helping
escalate the murder rate.
   In 1986, police believed they would stop the city's drug and
homicide problem by arresting as many people as possible. But after
a special anti-drug program made more than 46,000 arrests, the
city's jails are bulging. On the streets, new drug peddlers step
forward to take the place of those who go to jail.
   ``Since 1985, we've arrested a number of people but the problem
still persists,'' Smith said.
   ``The thing that is driving drug crime in D.C. is the sale and
distribution of drugs,'' said Richard Bennett, a professor of
justice at American University. ``Police can have very little
effect on that as long as there is supply and demand.''
   Police are trying to beef up their presence in drug-ravaged
neighborhoods with a return to the traditional walk-the-beat
strategy. A Rapid Deployment Unit also has been created to send as
many as 100 officers into these neighborhoods.
   Bennett believes results from the new program may be slow in
coming.
   ``If a chief of police says he will stop homicides in the next
quarter, he is telling a lie,'' Bennett said. ``We can have an
impact on drugs, but it will take a long time.''
   And, as in the past, most of the victims and the assailants are
young, black men ages 18 to 25.
   ``The victim looks very much like the offender, young and
minority,'' Bennett said.
   The police department's Rapid Deployment plan may be in for a
severe, immediate test.
   Statistics reveal that most of the homicides in the past four
years occurred in the final three months of the year, officials
said.

   Five soldiers who survived an Army
helicopter crash have been released from the hospital, but their
civilian flight instructor, who disappeared when the craft sank
into a lake, remained missing.
   Authorities halted a search for Phillip E. Walker of Sheridan,
Ark., when darkness fell Friday. Volunteer divers from a diving
club were back in the water this morning, said Fort Sill
spokeswoman Sheila Samples.
   But they have been on the job since Thursday night and were
``near exhaustion,'' and a team of Army divers was being brought
from Virginia to replace them later in the day, she said.
   Walker vanished when the UHV-1 Chinook helicopter he was riding
in crashed into Lake Ellsworth late Thursday. The copter was on a
night-training mission as its crew prepared for possible deployment
in the Persian Gulf.
   The five crewmembers were plucked from the lake by local
residents who used a 12-foot fishing boat to rescue them. They were
held overnight at Reynolds Army Community Hospital for observation.
   Walker, a maintenance facility manager for the Army at Little
Rock, Ark., was at Fort Sill to help train the 374th Air Ambulance
Company, a Little Rock reserve unit activated as part of Operation
Desert Shield, Ms. Samples said.
   ``I don't know if he was the pilot, but he is an instructor
pilot,'' Ms. Samples said.
   A CH-47 Chinook helicopter from Fort Sill partially lifted the
fuselage of the downed aircraft from the lake Friday evening, but
the wreckage broke free and fell back into the water.
   The rescued crewmen were identified Friday as Chief Warrant
Officer 4 John D. Bayer, 41, of Beech Bluff, Tenn.; Sgt. James A.
Pappas, 26, of Texarkana, Texas; Sgt. Douglas R. Murray, 25, of
Fayetteville, Ark.; Spec. Bryant T. Vaughger, 26, of Little Rock;
and Spec. Michael W. Pierce, 27, of Rogers, Ark.
   Some crew members said they were using night vision goggles for
the first time during the exercise.
   The use of the goggles, which electronically enhance moonlight,
has come under fire in recent years because some pilots say they
limit peripheral vision and cause other problems. The Army says it
has improved the goggles after they were blamed for a 1988 crash at
Fort Campbell, Ky., that killed 17 soldiers.

   A natural gas line was ruptured early Saturday
by a barge trying to dock in a waterway known as the Arthur Kill,
raising fears of an explosion off Staten Island before winds
dispersed the gas, authorities said.
   The barge, owned by the Bouchard company, was being pushed by a
tugboat into a Staten Island terminal when its rudder hooked the
pipe in about 25 feet of water, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty
Officer Howard Holmes.
   The broken 16-inch main sent an unknown amount of gas into the
air about 50 feet off the shoreline, creating the possibility of an
explosion, said Holmes. The city Fire Department was called in case
of a fire caused by the leak, he said.
   But the line was tuned off, and stiff winds dispersed the gas
without incident, authorities said. The rupture did force a
shutdown of a section of the Arthur Kill for 7{ hours, Holmes said.
   There were no injuries or evacuations, authorities said.
   The pipe is owned by the Texas Eastern Corp. There was no answer
Saturday at the company's offices in New Jersey or Staten Island.
   The Coast Guard is investigating the leak but has not determined
if anyone is to blame. The leak was too minor to affect the
environment, said Steven Whinham, a Coast Guard marine science
technician.
   The Arthur Kill, a major route for barge and ship traffic in a
heavily industrialized area, has been the site of several major oil
spills this year.

   Major Indian news organizations stopped
referring to Sikh extremists as ``terrorists'' this week after the
militants issued death threats against journalists.
   A statement signed by the Panthic Committee, a five-man group
guiding the Sikh militant movement in Punjab, said journalists
would meet ``memorable punishment'' if they continued to use the
word ``terrorists'' while writing about the Sikh secessionist
campaign.
   ``Consequences of violation could be death,'' the statement
said, according to excerpts carried by Press Trust of India and The
Hindustan Times. Any death sentence can be appealed to the
committee, the statement added.
   Sikh radicals have killed an average of 16 people a day in
Punjab in the last two weeks in ambushes, bombings and massacres of
passengers pulled off buses, according to police officials. More
than 2,930 people have been killed by the extremists so far this
year in Punjab, a prosperous farming state on the Pakistani border.
   The warning to journalists was contained in what the committee
called a ``code of conduct'' for reporting on Punjab. The ``code''
takes effect Dec. 1, according to the six-page statement received
Wednesday by Indian newspaper and news agency offices in
Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab state.
   For the next three days, ``militant'' gradually replaced
``terrorist'' in major Indian dailies, including The Hindustan
Times, The Times of India, The Statesman and Indian Express.
   Similarly, the two national news agencies did not mention
``terrorists'' Saturday in stories about a dozen Punjab killings
that police attributed to Sikh militants.
   For years, Press Trust of India and United News of India, like
most Indian newspapers, seldom used any word except ``terrorists''
in their stories about the daily killings in Punjab. Similarly,
Punjab police were said to have arrested - or ``shot dead in an
encounter'' - ``terrorists'' or ``dreaded ultras.''
   Reporters for foreign news organizations generally have referred
to Sikh separatists, radicals, extremists or militants.
   Three top Indian news executives said Saturday their
organizations had not made any policy decision to comply with the
Panthic Committee's ``code.'' They said the choice of words was up
to the correspondents on the scene.
   ``If they send it in as `militants,' our (copy) desks would let
it go. The same if they send it in as `terrorists,' '' one
executive said. Like the others, he asked not be be identified
further.
   Journalists in Punjab's two biggest cities, Chandigarh and
Amritsar, said they had been warned by Sikh militants to stop using
the word ``terrorist.'' The journalists, who requested anonymity
out of fear for their safety, said the warnings started about a
week ago and usually came by telephone.
   However, police officials were still talking about
``terrorists'' when they briefed reporters on a bomb attack that
killed five policemen Saturday.
   The Panthic Committee's warning against the continued use of
``terrorists'' was the first time such a demand has been made by
Sikh extremists in their 8-year-old separatist campaign.
   But they have often accused Indian news media of unfair
reporting on the movement to set up an independent Sikh nation
called Khalistan, or Land of the Pure. At least 33 journalists and
62 newspaper vendors have been killed by the extremists since 1982.
   The top five leaders of the Panthic Committee are wanted by
police for sedition. The committee controls the five major militant
groups in Punjab.
   Sikhs, whose faith has roots in both Islam and Hinduism, have a
slight majority over Hindus in Punjab. Nationwide they comprise 2
percent of India's 880 million people, while Hindus constitute 82
percent.
   Sikh separatists have long complained of cultural, political and
economic discrimination by India's officially secular but
Hindu-dominated government.

<TEXT>
   A fast-moving fire northwest of Boulder
destroyed 14 structures today and forced the evacuation of scores
of residents. A man was in custody on suspicion of arson.
   More than 200 firefighters were battling the blaze that began
shortly after 2 a.m. in a home west of U.S. Highway 36. It spread
as 60 mph winds fanned the flames and destroyed 2,400 acres by
midmorning, authorities said.
   No major injuries were reported; some firefighters reportedly
suffered minor burns and smoke inhalation.
   The 14 destroyed structures included homes and garages,
officials said.
   ``The wind is wreaking havoc,'' Capt. Chuck Pringle of the
Boulder County Sheriff's Department said early this morning.
   Officials believed they had the fire mostly under control by
midmorning, but winds kicked up again, fanning the flames to
100-feet heights and forcing the evacuation of a some houses.
   ``It has now changed for the worse,'' Pringle said late this
morning.
   Pringle said they have arrested a man identified as Arnold Stein
for investigation of fourth-degree arson and reckless endangerment.
He is accused of setting his mattress on fire in his home, then
pulling it outside, where the high winds spread the fire.
   ``The fire is suspicious in origin. We took a person into
custody,'' said Boulder County Sheriff-elect George Epp. ``We are
familiar with him. I'd rather not say anything other than that
we're familiar with him.''
   The American Red Cross established an emergency evacuation
center at a junior high school for residents forced to flee from
their homes. By early morning about 30 residents were in the
center, said Red Cross spokeswoman Margaret Wright.
   Gov. Roy Romer toured the fire-ravaged area this morning and
ordered National Guard helicopters to fly above the fire to douse
the hot spots, while waiting for a slurry bomber, a type of
firefighting plane, to arrive from California.
   ``The slurry bombers are all out of the area ... the only way we
could drop water was from a helicopter and that's what we're trying
to do,'' he said.
   The State Patrol closed both south and northbound lanes of
Highway 36 just north of Boulder because of the fire.
   Residents said the fire woke them up, and many were still drowsy
and confused.
   ``My wife smelled smoke. ... We jumped out of the house. We saw
the flames go by the house and it seemed OK,'' said resident Rich
Larson. He said he and wife then noticed two hot spots on the roof,
and thinking the fire had gotten to their attic, tey evacuated.
   ``I woke up with the world quite orange,'' said resident
Jonathan Corbet. ``So I got in my car and bailed out. It seems like
most of my neighbors' homes were destroyed.''
   The fire started on the west side of Highway 36, and the 14
destroyed homes were in a subdivision there. For a time, the fire
jumped to the east side of the highway, threatening another
subdivision, but firefighters doused the fire quickly, saving the
homes, Epp said.
   ``The forecast is for gusty winds today so we're being very
cautious. We hope we have a handle on it now,'' Epp said. ``We're
not used to having fires in the wintertime but we're prepared for
it.''
   The National Weather Service posted a high wind watch along the
Front Range for today and predicted temperatures in the low 70s
with no humidity.

<HEAD>PAC Leader Says Rival Anti-Apartheid Groups Should Work Together</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
and a rival opposition group, the Pan Africanist Congress, should
work together to force the end of apartheid and a new constitution,
a PAC leader said Saturday.
   A de facto alliance by the two groups would reverse decades of
rivalry within the black movement opposed to apartheid, South
Africa's system of racial segregation and white dominance.
   Clarence Makwetu, recently named acting head of the militant PAC
ater the death of its president, Zeph Mothopeng, made the
statement a day after a similar call by ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   Mandela is scheduled to meet Tuesday with President F.W. de
Klerk to discuss planned negotiations on ending apartheid and
giving political power to the black majority.
   The meeting comes amid building tension between the ANC, the
largest opposition group, and the white-led government. The two
sides have held peace talks since May aimed at removing obstacles
to the constitutional negotiations, planned for next year.
   But the government recently has condemned the ANC's campaign of
protests and strikes against apartheid as a form of violent
rebellion.
   Mandela has called for increased protests to pressure the
government to continue its reforms. He said South African blacks,
prohibited by law from voting in national elections, must use mass
action to express their grievances.
   On Friday, Mandela said he would demand election of a special
assembly to write a new constitution and formation of an interim
government to help ease the transition to a non-racial political
system.
   The government has rejected similar calls by other
anti-apartheid leaders, saying it must remain intact to maintain
stability while negotiations take place.
   Mandela's demands indicate a hardening of the ANC's negotiating
position. He also questioned de Klerk's willingness to proceed with
negotiations, and called for black opposition groups such as the
ANC and PAC to band together in seeking change.
   He said the PAC's choice of Makwetu as acting leader gave him
hope for unity. The two men spent 10 years together as prisoners on
Robben Island.
   Makwetu, speaking at an African trade summit in Swaziland, said
Saturday he agreed with Mandela that their organizations should
work together to oppose the government.
   He said he would work to unite various opposition groups so that
``we can confront de Klerk with a demand for a constituent
assembly.''
   De Klerk has pledged to end apartheid and negotiate a new
constitution, but also has called for protection of minority
rights.
   The ANC calls for a non-racial political system with equal
voting rights for all citizens.
   The PAC has traditionally been more militant than the ANC and
some other anti-apartheid organizations. It was formed by ANC
members who split from the group more than three decades ago, and
believes blacks must struggle for their freedom and find dignity in
the process, rather than gaining equality through white concession
or compromise.
   Black leaders have previously called for unity in opposing the
government, but longtime rivalries and ideological differences have
divided the opposition movement.
   The ANC and the conservative Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party
have waged virtual warfare for five years in Natal Province,
leaving 5,000 people dead. The fighting spilled over to black
townships near Johannesburg in August, killing more than 800
people.
   Neither Mandela nor Makwetu mentioned Inkatha in their comments.

   Despite a controversial projection about a
massive Midwest earthquake, some residents along the New Madrid
fault are more worried about getting knocked down by a TV truck
than a temblor in early December.
   ``We've got reporters running out our ears,'' New Madrid Police
Chief Jim Helms said. ``They've been here from Washington,
Michigan, Kansas City, Oklahoma and as far south as Houston, Texas.
We've had them every day.''
   New Madrid a town of about 3,300 in southeastern Missouri, has
become earthquake central for much of the media zeroing in on Iben
Browning's projection and the accompanying anxiety in the region.
   Browning is the New Mexico scientist-business consultant who
says his research shows conditions will be right for a major
earthquake along the New Madrid Fault on or about Dec. 3. He has
projected a 50-50 chance.
   He based his projections on tidal forces, which will be
particularly strong at that time. Most scientists discount his
tidal theory but say that eventually there will be a powerful
earthquake along the fault.
   Browning's projection nevertheless has led school officials in
at least four states to call off classes. It also has renewed
attention to earthquake preparedness in a region that experiences
several hundred minor to not-even-felt tremors a year.
   The New Madrid Fault zone runs roughly from Marked Tree in
northeast Arkansas, across the Missouri Bootheel and up to near
Cairo in southern Illinois. It's named for New Madrid, which was
destroyed by a series of strong quakes in the early 1800s that were
felt all the way to the East Coast.
   Since reports of Browning's work came to light earlier this
year, the media have focused increasing attention on the New Madrid
fault zone.
   Television stations from throughout the region have done
ratings-month series on the projection, the fault zone and
earthquake preparedness. Reporters have descended from Detroit,
Minneapolis, Baltimore and Tampa, Fla. People magazine and the
television program ``Unsolved Mysteries'' also have been to town.
   Although New Madrid residents have become used to being
interviewed, the town is bracing for Monday, Dec. 3, when the
reporters, photographers, engineers and producers are expected back
en masse. Helms said three blocks may be roped off to accommodate
the television satellite trucks that will roll into town.
   Rumors are flying: Dan Rather will be here, Willard Scott is
coming. Motel rooms have been snatched up, interviews arranged.
   Mayor Dick Phillips is understanding. He'll have to work as
usual at Phillips Fertilizer Co. on Dec. 3 and then conduct a city
council meeting that evening, but he'll also try to be available
for interviews.
   The situation puts the news media in an interesting predicament
- is the possibility of an earthquake, discounted by most experts,
a story? Do you send a reporter just in case, or do you ignore it
and hope you don't miss what could be the region's biggest story of
the year?
   Editors across the country are deciding.
   ``We're going mainly expecting nothing to happen,'' said Susan
Okie, acting science editor at the Washington Post. ``This is a
story because of the excitement it's generated.''
   The feeling is the same at the Baltimore Sun, said national
editor Ed Goodpaster.
   ``It's like any other prediction. There are those that you
really have to pay attention to to see whether anything does
happen,'' Goodpaster said. ``If it does happen, you're in a good
position to report on it, and if it doesn't happen, it's a good
story, too.''
   At least one of the major television networks is planning to
send a national correspondent. Dozens of network affiliates will be
on hand; others will be stationed in Memphis, the closest big city
to the fault zone.
   ``We're approaching this as a news event in itself, the concern
that this prediction has caused,'' said John Paxson, a producer for
CBS News, who will be traveling from Dallas. ``While most experts
kind of sniff at the idea that this man can predict earthquakes,
the prediction is there and a lot of people are very worried about
it.''
   The Associated Press will be there. Cable News Network is
planning live coverage. NBC is still deciding whether to send a
correspondent or rely on affiliates.
   ABC News has made the decision not to go.
   ``If there is a quake, we'll go,'' said Bob Crawford, assignment
manager for ABC's Midwest bureau in St. Louis. ``But we're not
planning to go anywhere to wait.''
   Reporters won't be the only ones traveling to New Madrid. Two

   Maoist rebels have killed a leader of Peru's
opposition Christian Democratic Party, shooting him three times
after submitting him to a ``revolutionary trial.''
   Javier Puiggros Planas, considered one of Peru's top
agricultural experts, was killed after some 50 Shining Path rebels
invaded his farm Friday in the town of Huaura, near the Pacific
coast 80 miles north of Lima.
   The guerrillas also killed an agricultural engineer and
destroyed farm machinery in the series of attacks Friday. Three
rebels were later killed in a shootout with police, police said
Saturday.
   The rebels led Puiggros before a group of fieldhands and accused
him of exploiting his workers. They then shot him in the chest,
stomach and head, police said. The rebels often put people on mock
trials before killing them.
   The rebels, led by a woman, arrived in a truck that normally
brings workers to Puiggros' farm.
   After killing Puiggros, the rebels burned tractors and buildings
on his farm. They also attacked two other farms, where they blew up
tractors and stole chickens.
   The rebels also stopped an agricultural engineer driving to one
of the farms. His body was later found in a ditch.
   Puiggros was considered one of Peru's top agricultural experts
and wrote a column on farming for a leading Lima newspapers. He was
a long-time leader of the center-right Popular Christian Party,
part of the coalition that backed the 1990 presidential bid of
Mario Vargas Llosa.
   Vargas Llosa, the internationally acclaimed novelist who lost
the election in June to President Alberto Fujimori, took strong
stands against cocaine production and the rebels. Vargas Llosa has
said more than 200 of his campaign workers were killed, and most of
the attacks were attributed to the Shining Path.
   Rebel attacks have increased in recent months in the Huaura
River Valley, a rich farming region. The Shining Path this year has
stepped up attacks in coastal farming regions both north and south
of Lima, often killing the farm owners.
   More than 20,000 Peruvians have been killed in political
violence in the 10 years since the Shining Path first took up arms.

   For three months, Pfc. Lisa
Wagner has been helping to wash 6,000 pieces of laundry a day.
Spec. Norman Wiemken has been helping to bake 3,000 loaves of
bread. Spec. Donald Gower has been repairing a never-ending stream
of broken air conditioners, engines and generators.
   ``I think these soldiers are the unsung heroes,'' said Command
Sgt. Maj. Lester Sinclair, the top-ranking non-commissioned officer
whose troops were the first on the ground to support the military
buildup in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   Combat troops preparing to confront the Iraqis may grab the
headlines and TV air time, but the soldiers of the 530th Supply and
Services Battalion know who helps keep the fighters fed and clothed
and their weapons battle-ready.
   ``We work 24 hours a day to supply those individuals to perform
their duties. We're not here for a lot of glory. We're here to do
our jobs,'' said Sinclair, 41, of Jacksonville, N.C.
   Soldiers from his battalion have been sent to Honduras, Egypt
and Panama in the last nine months.
   ``They couldn't move without us,'' said Gower, 22, of
Sacramento, Calif., who was working on a generator which had a bad
fuel injector pump, a common problem here caused by lower-grade
diesel fuel than is used back home.
   With 200,000 fresh U.S. troops joining the 230,000 already in
the Persian Gulf, the logistics operation is expanding rapidly. But
Maj. Gen. William ``Gus'' Pagonis, the Army's logistics chief in
Saudi Arabia, said ``it's going to be a lot easier this time.''
   When President Bush announced Operation Desert Shield on Aug. 7,
combat units of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division flew here from
Ft. Bragg, N.C., with minimal supplies.
   The first units of the 530th battalion, also from Ft. Bragg, hit
the ground four days later, but the initial deployment was almost
100 percent dependent on Saudi support.
   Now, Pagonis said, a logistical staff of about 16,000 is in
Saudi Arabia and the logistical support for the new troops ``will
be coming in with or ahead of the combat forces.''
   The 530th, which normally supports only the 82nd Airborne, is
currently providing backup support for every division in Saudi
Arabia and primary support for about 30,000 soldiers mainly in rear
areas.
   The battalion commander, Lt. Col. Guillermo Giandoni, 40, of
Chula Vista, Calif., said he's prepared to support any newly
arrived troops as they transit to forward areas.
   ``We're doing four times as much work as we would normally do in
a peacetime environment with the same number of people. So we feel
pretty good about that,'' said Giandoni.
   At a huge compound called Superleg City, where the 530th has set
up operations, Capt. Dan Adams, 30, of Little Rock, Ark., surveyed
stacked cartons of TV-style dinners, rolls of barbed wire and other
supplies.
   He said he had plenty of insect repellant but was still waiting
for shipments of tan desert camouflage tents and uniforms,
nicknamed ``chocolate chips'' because of their pattern, to replace
the old green camouflage.
   In the motor shop area, Sgt. James Krieg, 32, of Norwalk, Ohio,
was working on a generator.
   ``Everybody in the region brings all their equipment over to us.
We've got a lot more work to do,'' he said. ``Parts are starting to
come in a little faster now than when we first got here. We were
having a lot of trouble - We didn't have engines or major
components.''
   At the laundry, where about 12,000 pieces of clothing are washed
and dried every day, Pfc. Wagner, 20, of Salt Lake City, was
sweating as she loaded a machine. Two teams work 10-hour shifts to
get clean clothes back to the troops in 48 hours.
   ``That's a lot of laundry,'' she said. ``It's a morale support.
It's a booster. It's a job and I like it.''
   The easiest place to find in the compound is the bakery, which
supplies 16,000 soldiers a day. Just follow your nose, which will
either be sniffing white bread or cinnamon-raisin bread, to the
tent with the sign: ``Born To Bake.''
   Inside, Spec. Wiemken, 22, of Polo, Ill., was carrying heavy
trays of bread from the oven to the cooling racks. He said the
support troops might be the forgotten soldiers, but ``every soldier
loves fresh bread.''

<HEAD>Rapist Singleton Arrested Second Time on Shoplifting Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEFFNER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who served eight years in prison for
raping a teen-ager and chopping off her forearms has been arrested
for the second time this year on a shoplifting charge, accused of
trying to steal a $4 hat.
   A security guard at a suburban Wal-Mart summoned police Friday
and said the man, Lawrence Singleton, paid for some diapers but not
a white hat he took from the men's department.
   He was stopped by employees after leaving the store and gave a
phony name, according to an arrest report. Singleton, 63, gave his
name as Bill Johnson when a Hillsborough County sheriff's deputy
arrived.
   The deputy warned the Tampa native that giving a false identity
is a crime, but Singleton insisted his name was Johnson, according
to the report.
   Singleton then gave the officer a woman's name and a telephone
number to verify he was Bill Johnson. But when the deputy called
and described the suspect, the woman identified him as Singleton
and said she was his sister.
   He was cited on charges of petty theft and resisting arrest
without violence - that is, by giving a false name.
   Singleton was not taken to jail. He was released after signing a
misdemeanor citation and was ordered to appear in court Jan. 2.
   Singleton, who said he lives with his sister in the Tampa area,
was released from the Hillsborough County Jail on Sept. 18 after
serving two months of a six-month sentence for petty theft. He
pleaded no contest to stealing a $10 disposable camera in April
from a drug store.
   In California, Singleton drew public ire in1987 after he was
freed eight years, four months into a 14-year sentence for the 1978
mutilation-rape of a 15-year-old hitchhiker, who was left to die
along a road.
   After he was paroled, prison authorities shuttled him from city
to city as residents staged angry demonstrations and even filed
suit to keep him out of their communities.
   Finally, prison authorities wound up housing him in a mobile
home on the grounds of San Quentin Prison until his parole ended in
1988. He then returned to his home state of Florida.

<TEXT>
   Poland, seeking a leader who will hold the
country together as it pursues democracy and a market economy,
picks its first popularly elected president Sunday in a contest
that has split Solidarity.
   The last pre-election poll showed Solidarity Chairman Lech
Walesa comfortably leading the field of six, with his former ally
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki the closest challenger.
   But it appeared there will be a runoff vote on Dec. 9 because no
candidate had more than 50 percent of the vote, according to the
state television poll taken Monday and Tuesday.
   The campaign officially ended at noon Friday by order of the
National Election Commission. Officials were told to be on the
lookout for illegal electioneering Saturday, including hanging
posters or distributing leaflets.
   Poles living abroad began casting ballots Saturday - one day
early - so as not to delay the final count. Voting was taking place
in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and
Venezuela and aboard Polish ships in the Pacific.
   The balloting in Poland was to begin at 6 a.m. Sunday and end at
8 p.m. About two-thirds of the nation's more than 27 million voters
were expected to cast ballots. First partial results were expected
late Sunday.
   The television poll, with an error margin of plus or minus 3
percent, gave Walesa 38 percent of the votes, Mazowiecki 23 percent
and Stanislaw Tyminski 17 percent; 13 percent went to three minor
candidates, and 9 percent were undecided.
   Tyminski's support appeared to be slipping, however. The emigre
businessman returned after 21 years in Peru and Canada to mount a
free-spending campaign based on his claimed economic expertise.
   He shocked Mazowiecki's supporters by out-polling the prime
minister in one survey. But since then, Tyminski has faced a
barrage of criticism in the press. One commentator said Poland
would be a ``laughing stock'' if it elected him.
   ``If he wins, I will emigrate,'' Walesa declared on Thursday.
   The other candidates are: Roman Bartoszcze of the Polish
Peasants Party; former Communist Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, endorsed
by the Social Democracy party; and Leszek Moczulski, head of the
patriotic-nationalist Confederation for an Independent Poland.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist general who ordered
martial law to crush Solidarity and imprisoned Walesa and
Mazowiecki in December 1981, is expected to hand over the office to
the winner before Christmas.
   At that time, the still-existing World War II
government-in-exile in London is expected to present the symbols of
authority from the prewar Second Polish Rpublic. The London exiles
never recognized the Soviet-sponsored state created in Poland after
the war.
   Walesa proposed Mazowiecki as Eastern Europe's first
non-Communist prime minister in August 1989, but he and his close
adviser of nearly a decade fell out in a bitter dispute this year
that split Solidarity.
   Last spring, Walesa began attacking the government, accusing it
of moving too slowly in reforming the economy and of not removing
enough holdover Communists from powerful positions.
   The Mazowiecki camp answered that Walesa was destabilizing
Poland at a critical time because of personal ambitions and a
feeling of resentment that he was on the political sidelines.
   Mazowiecki supporters, including most of the old Solidarity
elite, say the prime minister will overtake Walesa in the second
round, picking up votes from other candidates.
   At Walesa headquarters in Gdansk last week, supporters were
still talking about a first-round victory. Walesa has called for a
broad mandate because of Poland's economic problems.
   Walesa planned to spend Sunday at home in Gdansk after voting in
the morning and attending Mass. He was to watch returns on
television at his headquarters in the evening.
   Mazowiecki had similar plans. Tyminski would not say what his
plans were.
   The first task of the new president will be to nominate a prime
minister, because Mazowiecki will have to give up the office if he
wins and has said he will resign if he loses. Walesa has said he
has five candidates in mind.
   Both Mazowiecki and Walesa are believed to have Deputy Prime
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland's yearlong
radical economic reform program, high on their lists for prime
minister.
   The president has a five-year term and can be re-elected once.
   The president is head of state and commander in chief of the
military, responsible for internal and external security. He
nominates the prime minister when a government falls, has limited
veto power over legislation and can dissolve parliament or declare
a state of emergency under strictly defined circumstances.
   But the powers would be redefined and possibly strengthened in a
new constitution expected in 1991.

<TEXT>
   Voters in Czechoslovakia cast
their final ballots for newly structured local governments Saturday
in an election that marked another step toward democracy.
   In southern Slovakia, where balloting had begun Friday, the
election was also expected to measure the strength of separatist
sentiment. Voting in the Czech republic was held only Saturday.
   Under the previous Communist system, towns, villages and city
districts were run by national committees that were controlled by
the Communist Party. But as of Saturday, the committees will be
replaced by Western-style municipal councils.
   As he cast his ballot, Premier Marian Calfa said he hoped the
elections would help ``break local Mafias'' of the past system.
   Nationwide, 97 parties fielded more than 232,000 candidates,
disputing 100,000 municipal and village council seats. Slovaks also
chose mayors directly. In the Czech lands, elected councils were to
pick mayors.
   Polls closed at 2 p.m. (8 a.m. EST) in Slovakia and at 8 p.m. (2
p.m. EST) in the Czech lands. Final results were not expected
before late Sunday.
   No party fielded candidates in every constituency, although the
Communist Party ran the most - in about 19 percent of the districts
nationwide.
   In Slovakia, where there has been strident nationalist agitation
for secession since the collapse of communism a year ago, balloting
took on a special significance.
   The Slovak Nationalist Party, the largest of the political
groups favoring a separate Slovakia, had candidates in only 4
percent of the 5,687 Slovak electoral districts. But party
officials predicted their candidates would gain more than 20
percent of the vote where they competed.
   The nationalists are the fourth-strongest party in the Slovak
parliament, with 13 percent of seats. A strong showing in the
municipal vote would strengthen their hand.
   Conversely, a good performance by candidates of the Slovak
government coalition of Public Against Violence, the Christian
Democrats and the Democratic Party would bolster efforts to keep
Czechoslovakia united.
   The last pre-election poll indicated Public Against Violence
would win in about 29 percent of districts they were contesting,
followed by the Christian Democrats with 27 percent and the
nationalists with 17 percent.
   In the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, Civic Forum, the
loose democratic coalition founded by President Vaclav Havel, was a
clear favorite. But there is no issue in the Czech region as
divisive as separation.
   Peter Tatar, a founding member of Public Against Violence, said
that in Slovakia the issue of self-determination was more important
than any other.
   ``This is not a balanced society,'' he said Saturday. ``With
insecurities about the future, many people have begun to seek
something they can identifiy with - national identity.''
   In Bratislava, the Slovak capital, several people interviewed at
polling stations said they had voted for nationalist candidates.
But others said they preferred a unified Czechoslovakia.
   ``It's better to live together,'' said Jozef Sivak, 38, at a
Bratislava polling station set up in the Lenin Museum and festooned
with busts and portraits of the Bolshevik leader.
   Potentially explosive nationalist sentiment in the southern
republic was kept in check for four decades by Communist leaders.
But it bubbled to the surface shortly after street protests swept
the Communists from power in 1989.
   While closely related in origins, Czechs and Slovaks developed
separately for centuries. Union in 1920 was, for many Slovaks,
primarily a way to end nearly 1,000 years of Hungarian domination.
   Persisting nationalist sentiment opened the way for secession in
1938, and six years as a Nazi puppet state.
   Reunification in 1944, created a Czech-dominated federal
government and an emasculated Slovak regional government. The
advent of Communist rule in 1948 perpetuated the imbalance.

<HEAD>Iacocca Fires Another Salvo in Feud with Japanese Politician</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca has fired
another salvo in his feud with a Japanese politician, whom he has
accused of arrogance and bashing America.
   ``I put (Shintaro) Ishihara in the class of, to be polite,
reactionaries,'' Iacocca said in an interview published in Playboy
magazine's January issue. ``Everybody has his share of loose
cannons and he's a loose cannon.''
   Iacocca's latest comments, released Saturday, came in the same
magazine where in October Ishihara called the U.S. auto executive
``irresponsible, incompetent, dirty dealing.''
   ``I'm not going to call him names,'' Iacocca said. ``I could
call him better names than that. They'd be dirty, but more
original.''
   The feud between the two blunt-speaking men broke out after
publication in Japan of the book ``The Japan That Can Say No,'' by
Ishihara and Sony Corp. co-founder Akio Morita. Ishihara, 57, is a
filmmaker and award-winning writer as well as a member of the
Japanese parliament.
   An unauthorized translation of the book was entered into the
Congressional Record by Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., and became a
target for criticism, and of Pentagon and congressional scrutiny.
   The collection of speeches by Ishihara and Morita has sold more
than a million copies in Japan, but it has been attacked in the
United States as an example of America-bashing.
   Ishihara told Playboy in October that the book's unofficial
translation contains misinterpretations and distortions, adding:
``I plan to publish an accurate, formal version, which is now being
prepared.''
   At the time, Iacocca said Ishihara's and Morita's ``arrogance
pours salt into an already open wound.''
   Ishihara said in the interview that Iaccoca used Japan as a
scapegoat for his own inadequacies as an industrialist.
   Last summer, Iacocca went on a six-city U.S. tour showing off
Chrysler's products and taking swipes at the Japanese government,
saying it should abandon its policy of closing the domestic market
to non-Japanese companies.
   It's a feeling Ishihara shares.
   ``Japan should say yes to America and open our market,'' he said
in the October Playboy interview.
   Ishihara said dropping the barriers would help Japanese
consumers by increasing competition and lowering prices.
   Iacocca also said Japan should open its borders to foreign
manufacturers as has the United States.
   ``We also have 10 transplants - Japanese and Korean car
factories that have opened in the U.S. and in Canada,'' he said.
``Every one is loaded like a Christmas tree with tax benefits from
the individual states.
   ``But nobody's ever invited me to do a transplant over in
Japan.''
   Chrysler has a marketing agreement with Honda Motor Co. Ltd. to
sell its Jeep vehicles in Japan. Also, Chrysler and Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. of Japan have a longstanding manufacturing
relationship.
   On other matters in the interview, Iacocca:
   -Suggested Americans should begin borrowing less money. ``We
should produce more and consume less,'' said Iacocca, who's been
paid an average of $11.5 million annually since 1985. ``We should
save more and borrow less.''
   -Repeated a call for the Bush administration to develop an
economic policy. ``We need a better organization at the highest
levels of government to understand what trade and commerce are all
about,'' he said.
   -Bemoaned the loss of Gerald Greenwald, who quit as Chrysler's
vice chairman earlier this year, prolonging Iacocca's tenure as the
company's chairman by at least a year. Greenwald, who was Iacocca's
heir apparent, left to head what proved to be an unsuccessful
effort by three unions to buy United Airlines.

his wife with the frozen bird, police said.
   Scott Nelson, 33, spent part of Thanksgiving in jail after his
wife, Jackie, signed a complaint accusing him of assault, said
Police Maj. Brandon Clabes.
   Mrs. Nelson, 24, told police her husband got angry and threw the
turkey and a pie into the parking lot at their apartment complex
after he discovered the bird was not thawed.
   When she gathered up her child to leave, she said Nelson hurled
the frozen bird at the car, breaking the windshield.
   She said he then grabbed her and threatened to assault her with
the turkey before she got away and drove to the police department.
   Nelson was released later Thursday after posting $204 bond.

   Katherine Volk, 82, of Susquehanna, Pa., apparently was confused
and turned north into southbound traffic when she got onto
Interstate 81 in Chenango about 3 p.m. Friday, Broome County
sheriff's officials said.
   Motorists frantically blew their horns and flashed their lights
to warn Volk, but she failed to turn around, said deputy Raymond
Schaffer said.
   Volk's car struck a four-wheel-drive vehicle carrying a family
of five home to New Jersey after a Thanksgiving Day visit to
relatives in Syracuse, police said.
   Killed was Kathy Nallen, 38, of Hackettstown, N.J. Mrs. Nallen's
aunt Evelyn Hostomsky, 71, was in serious condition Saturday at
Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton.
   Mrs. Nallen's husband, John, 44, who had been driving the
vehicle, and their two children were treated for minor injuries.
   The accident happened about 10 miles north of the New
York-Pennsylvania state line.

   Nationalist parties in
Bosnia-Hercegovina won a sweeping victory over the governing
Communists in Yugoslav republic's first free elections in 52 years,
the electoral commission announced Saturday.
   The Moslem Union of Democratic Action and the Serbian Democratic
Alliance took the majority of seats in the two chambers of the
republic's Parliament in the Nov. 18 voting.
   Last spring, center-right parties in Yugoslavia's northern
republics of Slovenia and Croatia ousted the Communists in the
first multiparty elections held in Yugoslavia since 1938. The
second round of a free ballot in the southernmost republic of
Macedonia will be held on Sunday.
   Bosnia-Hercegovina, whose 4.2 million people include Serbs,
Croats and Moslems, is geographically and politically at the heart
of Yugoslavia's bitter ethnic rivalries.
   Pre-election favorites, the reformed League of Communists and
the Alliance of Reform Forces of federal Premier Ante Markovic,
received only 24 of the 240 seats in the bicameral legislature in
the first round of voting in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
   A runoff ballot will be held on Dec. 2 in those constituencies
where no candidate won a clear majority in the voting. Fifty-nine
of the 240 seats will be recontested.
   In the 130-seat Citizens Chamber, the Moslem Union won 41 seats.
The Serbian party won 34 and the third nationalist party, the
Croatian Democratic Union, 20. The Communists won 13 seats and
Markovic's Alliance 11. There was no clear winner for the remaining
11 seats.
   In the 110-member Municipal Chamber, only 62 candidates won a
majority and voting will have to be repeated for the remaining
seats.
   The Serbs won 29 seats, the Moslems 20 and the Croats 13.
   The so-called leftist bloc, including the ruling Communists, won
no seats on the region's seven-seat state presidency council.
   The largest state of Serbia and its neighbor Montenegro will be
the last of the six republics to hold local elections. They are
scheduled for Dec. 9.
   Six main opposition parties in Serbia announced a boycott Friday
of the local elections, claiming the region's hard-line Communist
leadership was preparing to rig them.
   Earlier this week, the state's communist-dominated legislature
rejected an amendment to the electoral law that would have allowed
opposition representatives to be members of electoral committees.
   But Serbian authorities said observers from independent parties
would be allowed to monitor the counting of the ballots.
   Federal elections are to be held early next year.

   When Juliet Cheng's baby girl was
diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, she turned to traditional
Chinese remedies to treat the girl: acupuncture, herbal medicines
and massage.
   But now Cheng is running out of time to prove that her faith in
the medicine of her ancestors isn't misplaced and that her daughter
won't face the rest of her life crippled because of the treatments.
   Cheng has already lost temporary custody of her daughter,
Shirley, now 7. And if the girl's condition hasn't radically
improved by next month, a federal judge has granted doctors
permission to operate on the girl, against her mother's wishes.
   ``I have the rights, not them,'' Cheng said bitterly as she
waited to visit Shirley at Newington Children's Hospital, where the
girl is now living. ``They cannot force me to do this.''
   Cheng had little exposure to Eastern medicine as a girl growing
up in Shanghai. Her father was a urologist who attended a
Western-style medical school. He treated her with penicillin and
other staples of Western medicine.
   Cheng emigrated to the United States a decade ago, hoping to go
to college and become a lawyer. She met Shirley's father while
taking college preparatory classes, but the two never married, and
she has raised the girl alone.
   When Shirley was diagnosed with the crippling joint disease as
an 11-month-old infant, Cheng first turned to an American doctor.
He prescribed aspirin to ease the pain in her swollen joints.
   That didn't help, Cheng said, so she treated her daughter at
home with herbal potions. She also took her back to China, where
Shirley was treated with acupuncture, massage and concoctions made
from animal glands.
   Cheng says it was only during those four extended trips to China
that her daughter showed significant improvement.
   ``I know it works because we've tried it so many times with
Shirley. It helps her,'' Cheng said.
   Shirley suffered a relapse after returning from her last trip to
China about a year ago, Cheng said. A doctor in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
where the two were living with Cheng's own mother, suggested she
consult a specialist at Newington Children's Hospital.
   Doctors there told Cheng her daughter would never walk unless
she had surgery to relieve the tightness in the tendons and
ligaments around the joints in her hips, knees and left ankle.
   Cheng refused and the hospital persuaded the state Department of
Children and Youth Services to go to court in July to take
temporary custody.
   The two sides were back in court in October, when U.S. District
Judge T. Emmet Clarie gave Cheng until Dec. 5 to demonstrate that
non-Western treatment could help her daughter.
   The U.S. Supreme Court addressed a similar issue earlier this
year. In Fresno, Calif., the Laotian immigrant parents of a
6-year-old boy born with clubfeet opposed court-ordered corrective
surgery because they believed spirits inflicted the defect to
punish the family.
   In June, the Supreme Court refused to overturn lower court
rulings that ordered corrective surgery for the boy, Kou Xiong, but
hospitals have refused to perform the operations without consent
from his parents, Ger and Houa Vue Xiong.
   When Cheng couldn't find a traditional Chinese practitioner who
was also a licensed medical doctor, as required by Clarie's order,
she chose what she saw as the next best thing: a homeopathic
doctor.
   Homeopathy is a Western-based alternative medicine that is
popular in the Orient because it relies on similar philosophical
principles. Its practitioners use small doses of natural medicines
to strengthen the body's healing powers.
   Shirley is now receiving diluted doses of phosphorous and poison
ivy to relieve the swelling in her joints and improve her appetite.
   She also visits a physical therapist three times a week, for
two-hour sessions that sometimes try the little girl's patience. On
a recent visit, the usually happy girl wriggled around the therapy
table and complained, ``I want to go home.''
   Dr. William Shevin, the homeopathic doctor who is treating
Shirley, believes she could be cured and able to walk within two or
three years if she continues the current treatment.
   Shirley's physical therapist said the girl has shown slight
improvement during the homeopathic treatment. But doctors at
Newington believe she has gotten worse, said Thomas Hanley, a
hospital spokesman.
   Dr. Sherwin Nuland, an associate professor of surgery at Yale
Medical School who has studied both Western and Chinese medicine,
said Chinese treatment is effective in the early stages of
rheumatoid arthritis. But once there is anatomical damage, surgery
is the only answer, he said.
   ``She will be crippled for the rest of her life'' without
surgery, he said.
   Thomas Moriarty, a spokesman for the state Department of
Children and Youth Services, defended the agency's decision to
intervene.
   ``Although this case has undertones of cultural and
philosophical differences, we have to rely on what our doctors tell
us,'' Moriarty said. ``The bottom line is - we have to protect
children.''

<TEXT>
   A group of British women on Saturday won
the release of relatives held in Iraq's so-called human shield, and
Saddam Hussein promised a Catholic priest that he would free ``a
large number'' of Italians.
   Baghdad's official media announced the planned releases but did
not say when the hostages would be allowed to leave.
   Greece said 10 hostages would be released Sunday. The Iraqi
Embassy in Athens said Saddam ordered the release in response to an
appeal by representatives of the Greek-Iraqi Friendship
Association, currently visiting Baghdad.
   A German Foreign Ministery spokesman said German hostages freed
by Iraq also were expected to return home on Sunday afternoon.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
were about 170 Germans left in Iraq and in Kuwait. Iraq has said
that all German hostages would be allowed to leave, but the
spokesman said he did not know how many would be on Sunday's
flight.
   Hundreds of foreigners have been held in Iraq since the invasion
of Kuwait in August. Some have been freed in return for shipments
of food and medicines and others in an attempt to gain favor and
divide the international coalition opposed to the invasion.
   Saddam met for one hour with the 10 British women, who flew to
Baghdad last week seeking the release of their husbands, despite
advice from the British government against the trip.
   Iraqi state television quoted Saddam as telling the women:
``Preventing British nationals from leaving is not our wish, but is
one of the means to avert a bigger catastrophe.''
   It did not say how many Britons would be allowed to leave, but
that all of them ``are guests of the Iraqi people.''
   That indicated the men are among more than 400 Britons held at
strategic sites as human shields against a potential military
attack. Iraq calls these hostages ``guests.'' They also include 200
other foreigners, mainly Americans and Japanese.
   In addition to the Britons held at about 30 installations in
Iraq and occupied Kuwait, about 700 Britons also are banned from
traveling.
   Iraq imposed the ban in response to the U.S.-led multinational
military buildup in the region. Saddam said the foreigners'
presence would help avert a military confrontation over Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Earlier, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that he met
with Catholic Archbishop Hilarion Capucci and promised to free ``a
large number of Italian nationals.'' There are 270 Italians trapped
in Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
   The agency said Saddam was allowing the Italians to leave in
appreciation of Capucci's mission.
   The report followed the arrival in Baghdad on Saturday of an
Alitalia jetliner carrying 25 tons of medical supplies. Capucci was
at Baghdad Airport to receive the shipment, the television
reported.
   Capucci is the spiritual head of the 3,000-member Melchite-rite
Catholic community of Jerusalem, Arab Christians who have formed an
eastern-right branch of the Roman Catholic Church. The Melchite
Catholics recognize the primacy of the pope, but have broad
independence from the Vatican.
   The Syrian-born Capucci was jailed for nearly three years by the
Israelis on charges of smuggling arms to Palestinian guerrillas. He
was released and deported in 1977 after an appeal by Pope Paul VI.
He has since been living in Rome.
   A Finnish delegation arrived in Baghdad Saturday to try to win
freedom for Finnish hostages, that nation's radio reported.
   Two former government ministers, Paavo Vayrynen and Ulf
Sundqvist, traveled with Mikko Lohikoski, the vice chairman of the
Finnish-Arab Friendship Society.
   A Finnish Red Cross physician also made the trip to assess the
need for emergency aid for Iraqi children.

   A U.S. Army truck and a civilian
truck collided early Saturday, killing one American soldier and
injuring another, the U.S. military said.
   The Pentagon said the soldier was the 49th member of the U.S.
military to die since Operation Desert Shield began Aug. 7, five
days after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.
   Both U.S. soldiers were thrown from the rear of the 2{-ton Army
truck in the collision, a military statement said.
   One was pronounced dead at the scene and the other was taken to
a nearby military medical facility for treatment, the statement
said. His condition was not disclosed and no other details of the
accident were released.
   The soldiers, who were not identified pending notification of
next of kin, were from the 628th Transportation Company, 553rd
Combat Support Battalion, 101st Combat Support Group.
   U.S. military Police and Saudi police are investigating the
accident, the statement said.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokeswoman Jan Walker said the latest
fatality was the 46th accidental death since the operation began.
She said one soldier also died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound
and two people died of natural causes.

<TEXT>
   Several youths have been arrested in
connection with a series of mysterious slayings in Baghdad
elementary schools that began after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
diplomatic sources said Saturday.
   The official media denied there have been any killings, but
reported that 22 youths, including two girls, were arrested for
``reckless behavior.'' It was not immediately clear when the
arrests were made.
   The Iraqi news agency carried a statement from the Ministry of
the Interior, saying the youths had spread fear in elementary
schools. It said they had distributed pamphlets, written on school
walls and made telephone calls ``aimed at creating chaos.''
   Diplomatic sources reached by telephone said several Baghdad
school children had been found slain, their bodies repeatedly
slashed, in the toilets of their schools in the Iraqi capital.
   The diplomats said in one school a slogan written in red said
Iraqi children were being killed ``to avenge the killing of the
children of Kuwait,'' which Iraq invaded Aug. 2 and annexed six
days later.
   Diplomats said the killings have occurred in the almost four
months since Iraq's invasion of the emirate, but gave no specific
dates.
   Later Saturday, state television broadcast confessions from some
of the detainees, but none reported committing any action as
dramatic as the diplomatic reports.
   ``Reports of murders are fabricated rumors and lies,'' the
television announcer said.
   The children admitted that they wrote slogans on the walls, sent
notes to their classmates frightening them on behalf of a
fictitious group that they called ``The Black Hand Gang.''
   ``I wrote on the wall of my school, `It is your turn Zaid,' ''
said one youth who identified himself as Issam Abdul-Zahra. He did
not explain what he meant by that, or provide the full name of the
classmate he targetted for what he called ``a joke.''
   News reports said Interior Minister Samer Mohammed Abdel Wahab
met in an emergency session with Baghdad police Friday to discuss
the situation in elementary schools.
   The minister was quoted as telling police to ``redouble their
efforts to encounter those who dare to violate the security and
stability of the internal front at a time when Iraq is engaged in
battle with the evil enemy.''
   His comments and the ministry statement indicated that Iraqi
authorities feared some groups within Iraq might be trying to stir
domestic unrest while the government focuses on its confrontation
over Kuwait with U.S.-led forces.

   The Princess of Wales, Britain's courtly
clotheshorse, will have her portrait in the December issue of
British Vogue magazine.
   Buckingham Palace on Sunday released the set of glamor
photographs of the princess, wearing off-the-shoulder evening
dresses, taken by American photographer Patrick Demarchelier.
   The result is a formal portrait and two informal studies of
Britain's future queen. All the pictures show her with a
sophisticated, swept back hairstyle, dark eye makeup and wide
smile.
   In one, she wears a pearl-drop tiara that once belonged to Queen
Mary, the Prince of Wales's great-grandmother, and a sedate pearl
necklace.
   The two informal pictures will also be featured in the December
issue of the fashion magazine.
   Demarchelier took pictures of the princess and her sons, Prince
William and Prince Harry, last December in the grounds of
Highgrove, her Gloucestershire home.

   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - The Menudo a go-go is on as the
group scrambles to find two replacements for the youthful singers
who were fired after being arrested for possessing marijuana.
   Edgardo Diaz, creator of Menudo and the Puerto Rico-based
group's artistic director, said the search for two new Menudos
began Friday, after a Miami airport drug-sniffing dog detected
small amounts of marijuana in their pants.
   Oscar Llord, general manager for Sonotone Music, the group's
Miami record company, said the group's manager had fired the two
singers hours after their arrest.
   Sergio Gonzalez, 18, and Ruben Gomez, 16, were arrested Thursday
at Miami International Airport, Metro-Dade police Lt. James Kaelin
said. They have both since been released from custody.
   ``We've fought hard to keep the group alive, and it's very hard
to suffer these setbacks,'' Diaz said. ``These are kids we're very
fond of. It breaks my heart. But it does not mean that Menudo is
dead.''
   Menudo has had several lineups during its years. Members are
routinely replaced as they get too old to appeal to their pre-teen
and teen audience.

   PIERRE, S.D. (AP) - Kevin Costner, whose directorial debut was
an epic tribute to Indian life, has donated $120,000 to create a
permanent Sioux Indian exhibit at the South Dakota Cultural
Heritage Center.
   Costner directed and stars in the film ``Dances With Wolves,''
filmed in South Dakota last summer, and now playing nationwide.
Costner portrays a cavalry soldier who is befriended by Sioux
Indians.
   Costner and his wife decided to donate the money because they
wanted to do something for the state because of the reception they
received while making the movie, said Jim Larson, who is doing
fund-raising for the cultural center.
   The exhibit will include a depiction of the rise and fall of the
Ghost Dance, the forced retreat of the Sioux, and the transition of
the Sioux to reservation life.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Once upon a time, there was a big-mouthed
ex-mayor and a former congresswoman who liked hats.
   The time was Friday, when Ed Koch joined Bella Abzug to read
fairy tales to 100 youngsters at the Children's Museum of
Manhattan. The former adversaries didn't live happily ever after,
but they hooked up for ``Cinderella'' and ``Jack and the
Beanstalk.''
   The pair read two versions of each tale: a traditional one, and
an ``upside-down'' one telling the same story from a different
point of view. In the non-traditional ``Cinderella'' read by Abzug,
for example, one of the so-called ugly stepsisters ``sets the
record straight.'' The stories come from a series of books called
``Upside Down Tales.''
   The two made light of their history of political differences.
   ``I have great respect for her. I happen to like her, even if I
disagree with her,'' Koch said before the reading. Abzug echoed Ed:
``If you can't talk with each another, you can't disagree with each
other.''

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Country singer-songwriter Kathy Baillie
says uplifting love songs are hard to write because, like love
itself, they sometimes end up going bad.
   ``I like to either write or look for positive love songs because
there are so many that are depressing,'' she said recently in an
interview.
   ``They're difficult to write because you start out writing this
love song and it becomes, `She left him' and `Now I'm down.' ''
   She and husband Michael Bonagura are the country duo Baillie and
the Boys, whose hit records include ``A Fool Such as I,'' ``Oh,
Heart'' and ``Long Shot.''
   Bonagura is ``the Boys'' because the group was a trio until
member Alan LeBoeuf left a year ago and was not replaced.
   The two are touring with Kenny Rogers.

<TEXT>
   Western military experts are helping
Iraq maintain its production of chemical and other weapons, despite
U.N. trade sanctions on that country, Der Spiegel said Saturday.
   The newsmagazine, which in recent months reported the
involvement of German companies in Iraq's military industry, said
its information was based on accounts from recently released German
hostages and intelligence sources.
   The sources told Spiegel that Iraqi plants in Samarra were
producing 880 pounds daily of Tabun and Lost, two nerve gases.
   In earlier reports, Spiegel has said that six plants producing
poison gas at Samarra, noth of Baghdad, were built by German
companies.
   Dozens of German companies allegedly provided technology and
know-how to Iraq, helping the country obtain chemical and other
advanced weapons. German companies are also suspected of supplying
Iraq with equipment that could be used for making nuclear weapons,
according to previous Spiegel reports.
   Speigel said Saturday that German and other Western experts were
helping Iraq keep up production at military sites, including those
where Westerners were being held as ``human shields'' to deter
attack by multinational forces.
   Western experts and salesmen are still traveling to Iraq via
Jordan to conclude lucrative military contracts, the report said.
They have been guaranteed unhindered travel out of Iraq, Spiegel
said.
   Spiegel's report was released to other news media in advance of
its publication on Monday.
   Iraq is known to have a large arsenal of chemical weapons.
   The U.N. Security Council imposed the trade embargo on Iraq in
response to Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. About 350,000
troops from 26 nations have been deployed in the gulf region to try
to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
   In another development, the German Foreign Ministry said it
expects most of about 170 Germans still held by Iraq to return to
Germany on Sunday.
   Iraq's president Saddam Hussein has said he was freeing German
hostages because the Bonn government is seeking a peaceful solution
to the Gulf standoff.
   German television said 27 employees of the giant Siemens
electronics concern were allowed Saturday to leave Iraq and were
expected to arrive in Germany during the night on a DC-8 plane
chartered by Siemens.
   The main group of German hostages was expected to arrive in
Frankfurt Sunday afternoon aboard an Iraqi Airways plane.

<HEAD>White House, Swiss Officials Trade Charges Over Airport Scuffle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House will file a formal protest
this week with the Swiss government over a scuffle and shouting
match that occurred between members of President Bush's delegation
and Swiss security forces at Geneva airport.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the security force
treatment ``brutal and vicious.'' But Geneva police spokesman
Thierry Magnin described the actions of some American reporters as
``deplorable'' and ``inadmissible.''
   Fitzwater said a formal protest would be lodged with Swiss
Ambassador Edouard Brunner after Bush returns from Mexico.
   No one was available at the Swiss Embassy in Washington on
Saturday to comment.
   The incidents took place Friday while Bush was en route back to
the United States following an eight-day visit to Europe and the
Middle East.
   On Bush's arrival at the airport in Geneva, security officers
clashed with newsmen and photographers in the president's party.
The press people were pushed and shoved as they sought to approach
the ramp on which Bush would leave the plane.
   Fitzwater said U.S. chief of protocol Joseph Reed was poked in
the abdomen with a machine gun, and Jerome Delay, a
Washington-based photographer with the French news agency, Agence
France-Press, was roughed up. AFP in Washington said Delay was not
injured.
   Swiss foreign ministry spokeswoman Andrea Reichlin said Geneva
police were unaware that traveling White House reporters are
usually allowed under Air Force One's left wing to watch the
president come and go.
   But reporters traveling with Bush quoted a White House official
as saying Swiss police announced without explanation shortly before
Bush's arrival that they would bar reporters from that position.
   ``I've never seen that kind of brutal and vicious treatment by a
security force in the last 10 years,'' Fitzwater said.
   In another incident, Fitzwater said White House chief of staff
Jon Sununu was ``verbally attacked'' when he complained about the
earlier occurrences.
   But Magnin, in a telephone interview Saturday, said American
reporters ``did not respect security measures taken by Geneva
police ... or Swiss territorial sovereignty.''
   ``There certainly was a row and heated words, but this was to
enforce security measures ... taken in accord with the American
security services,'' Magnin said.
   Magnin said he could not comment on the machine gun incident.
   ``But if it happened, the submachine gun certainly was not
pointed at the diplomat,'' he added.
   He said Reed may have been mistaken for a non-diplomat because
it was dark and he was wearing a trench coat that may have obscured
his identifying badge.
   He said the police were simply doing their job and noted they
have long experience with dignitaries coming through Geneva.
   ``We don't expect to apologize because we think we acted
properly to maintain security,'' Magnin said.

Henderson said Saturday.
   The nine-year veteran was arrested Friday, on duty and in
uniform, after he walked out of a drug store where he had responded
to a threat he later admitted making, officials said.
   A stakeout team was waiting outside the Rite Aid Discount
Pharmacy, which received two threats two days apart.
   Novitis was charged with two counts of making bomb threats and
remained in jail Saturday on $20,000 ond. Each charge carries a
possible 15-year prison sentence.
   The 40-year-old deputy told detectives he became addicted
following an appendectomy in July, after being successfully treated
three years ago for a prior addiction. While he recovered from the
surgery, he had been assigned to light duty until Oct. 20. The
threats to pharmacies in his Brandon patrol area began Oct. 31,
Henderson said.
   ``He was very remorseful. It's a sad situation,'' Henderson
said.
   Detectives had been secretly watching Novitis since last week
when they noticed the bomb threats were at stores in his patrol
zone, and that Novitis would respond and sign all of the incident
reports, Henderson said.
   Also, one pharmacist told investigators he recognized Novitis'
voice from an earlier threat.
   On Friday, detectives watched Novitis telephone the Rite Aid
from a pay phone about a mile away, records show. A tap on the drug
store telephone also traced the call to the telephone booth.
   When the call was dispatched, Novitis volunteered to respond.
Detectives closed in after he evacuated the store and was leaving.
   Novitis also admitted making a bomb threat to the same store
Wednesday.
   Although Novitis has admitted stealing 200-300 prescription pain
killers over the past weeks, no drug charges were brought against
him because authorities couldn't pinpoint specific thefts.
   Novitis did not have any drugs with him or in his patrol car
when undercover detectives converged on him outside the pharmacy.
   He said he didn't steal drugs from every store, according to
Henderson. Sometimes, the pharmacist wouldn't let him have access
to the drug area, and other times there were too many other
deputies around.
   Henderson said none of the pharmacies had noticed or reported
any prescription pills missing.
   Sheriff's investigators will discuss the case with prosecutors
next week, Henderson said.
   Novitis, who has a wife and three children, was treated in 1987
for addiction to the pain killer Percodan, Henderson said.
   He successfully completed a 28-day treatment program and was
randomly tested for drugs. But no tests had been done since he
returned to work in October, Henderson said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday offered
the 15 Soviet republics a treaty giving them control over virtually
all affairs except defense. But his draft was dead on arrival in
nearly half the republics.
   The long-awaited draft union treaty, published in major
newspapers, is Gorbachev's attempt to stop the rapid splintering of
political unity in this huge and diverse country of 285 million
people.
   It is his blueprint for saving a degree of central authority. It
addresses some of the issues behind bloody ethnic conflicts and a
``paralysis of power'' hindering economic reform and worsening
shortages of food and consumer goods.
   The proposed treaty, drafted by Gorbachev and other members of
the Federation Council, would rename the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics the ``Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics.'' The treaty
said the union would be ``voluntary'' but did not identify who in
each republic - voters or legislators - would decide whether to
join.
   Each republic, ``as a sovereign state, has full state powers
over its territory. Treaty participants regard the Soviet Union as
a sovereign federative state formed as a result of the republics'
voluntary union,'' the draft says.
   The blueprint was sent to the legislatures of the union and the
15 republics for approval.
   It is there that more trouble lies ahead for Gorbachev, whose
influence and power over the country is eroding.
   ``Not only the Baltic states, but also many Soviet republics,
will not sign this treaty,'' Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis said in a television address to his republic, which is
in the forefront of drives to break from Moscow.
   At least six republics have already indicated they will not
sign: Armenia, Ukraine Georgia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The
participation of other republics is in doubt because of drives for
sovereignty or independence that have swept all but one - Kirgizia.
   Instead, many republics have been bypassing the Kremlin and
signing treaties with each other governing trade, cultural and
political ties.
   According to the draft union treaty, the Kremlin would continue
to control defense and borders. It would administer jointly with
republics an economic development program, the space program,
transportation and the energy system.
   The treaty rebuffs plans by several republics to introduce their
own currencies to replace the Soviet ruble, whose value has
plummeted. The draft says the union will join the republics in
setting monetary policy ``based on a single currency.''
   The draft also says the republics will own land and natural
resources, except for those the union needs to exercise its powers.
Many republics claim the central government has taken their land
and resources and used them for wasteful and polluting factories.
   The treaty would leave virtually all other issues - such as
management of the economy, education and culture - to the
republics. In the current system, central ministries in Moscow
supervise factories nationwide, often in disregard for local
conditions.
   The draft presents a formula for resolving jurisdictional
disputes that have paralyzed and confused the country for weeks,
especially holding up the transition from a centrally planned to a
market economy.
   In declarations of sovereignty, most republics and many regions
within them have declared local laws supreme over national
legislation. The draft union treaty proclaims, ``the supremacy of
republic legislation over republics' territories on all questions,
except those which are referred to the jurisdiction of the union.''
   The treaty, which would replace a 1922 accord that united the 15
republics but gave them few powers, says nothing about how a
republic might secede.
   The national legislature passed a law in April that requires
two-thirds of a republic's voters to approve secession in a
referendum. The republic would have to wait up to five years while
the terms of secession are negotiated.
   Gorbachev has maintained the people in the republics want to
remain in the union, and criticized republic legislators for
``separatism.''
   At a news conference Friday, Gorbachev warned that any attempt
to break up the Soviet Union without calling a referendum could
lead to ``bloodshed and civil conflict.''

<HEAD>Man's Attempt at Sailing Record Swamped by 50-foot Wave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sailors, one from this western
Michigan city, were defeated by mountainous waves off the tip of
South America in their quest to break a 136-year-old sailing
record, a spokeswoman said.
   Steve Pettengill, 39, of Grand Rapids and Rick Wilson, 40, of
Boston left San Francisco on Oct. 22 in Wilson's 60-foot triamaran
Great American. They were attempting to reach Boston in less than
76 days and six hours - the record set in 1853 by the cargo-laden
clipper Northern Light.
   But 50-foot waves driven by winds up to 80 mph overturned the
Great American off Cape Horn about 10 a.m. Thanksgiving Day, said
Barbara Kalunian, who spoke to Wilson via a ship-to-shore radio
Friday.
   Wilson said a larger wave righted the craft about an hour later.
The mast was broken into three pieces.
   Wilson and Pettengill had been in the water 31 days and were
about four days ahead of the record Wednesday.
   The sailors, pelted by hail and freezing rain, huddled in the
swamped craft for 14 hours. They were rescued Thursday night by the
900-foot container ship New Zealand Pacific. The huge ship nearly
plowed over the helpless craft before crew members spotted flares
shot off by Wilson and Pettengill.
   ``At the end, I really couldn't even open my eyes (to look at
the waves) - it was that frightening,'' Wilson told Kalunian.
``Obviously the forces of the sea are very strong.''
   The voyage was intended in part to raise funds for the American
Lung Association, which had a 900 telephone number set up where
interested people could call - for a fee - and hear progress
reports on the trip.
   Wilson said both men were in good condition. The New Zealand
Pacific was bound for the Netherlands, where it was scheduled to
arrive Dec. 10. The men will go on to the Netherlands before making
the journey back to the U.S.
   The sailors knew foul weather and treacherous seas probably
would greet them off Cape Horn, where the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans collide.
   After the boat was overturned, the men activated a
satellite-relayed distress signal designed to alert U.S. Coast
Guard and Chilean officials.
   A rescue plane had spotted the freighter about 100 miles from
the Great American. The crew dropped lines overboard, which Wilson
and Pettengill tied around their waists. In a dangerous rescue
mission in darkness and 30-35-foot waves, Wilson and Pettengill
jumped to a rope ladder dangling from the New Zealand Pacific.
   In 1989, Pettengill and a Canadian sailor successfully rounded
Cape Horn from east to west to break by 12 days a 135-year-old
record set by the clipper Flying Cloud.

<HEAD>Six Teens Charged in Theft of Sports Trading Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six teen-agers have been arrested in
the theft of $50,000 worth of sports trading cards, only about half
of which were recovered, police said.
   A 15-year-old, two 16-year-olds and two 17-year-olds were each
charged with two counts of burglary and two counts of grand
larceny, police said Friday. Larry Bolin, 18, of Virginia Beach,
faced those counts as well as conspiracy to commit burglary, police
said.
   The arrests took place over several days early last week, police
said.
   The theft occurred Oct. 21 at a storage shed used by trading
card dealer Bill Mittlestadt, part owner of A.H. Coins &amp; Stamps.
   The thieves took the hottest items, Mittlestadt said. ``They
were versed enough to only take the most in-demand merchandise,''
he said.
   None of the missing cards is individually worth more than $500,
but the stolen sets included a 1990 Star Pick premier basketball
edition of 70 cards, featuring David Robinson and Danny Ferry. Also
stolen were several cases of Upper Deck baseball cards featuring
Ken Griffey Jr. and Bo Jackson.
   Some of the arrested youths are collectors who have been in his
business, Mittlestadt said.
   ``I knew some of the kids involved,'' he said. ``We give the
kids all the breaks we can. It really hurt.''

<HEAD>Polls Indicate Conservatives - Without Thatcher - Moving Ahead of
Labor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conservative Party heavyweights lined up behind
the three candidates in the party leadership contest Saturday, and
polls showed the Conservatives moving ahead of Labor with a new
leader at the helm.
   Former defense secretary Michael Heseltine, Chancellor John
Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd are spending the weekend
canvassing the 372 Tory lawmakers who will choose between them in
Tuesday's second round of voting.
   Each man claims he is the best candidate to rally a party torn
by in-fighting and further shaken by the decision to resign
Thursday of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Tory leader for 15
years and prime minister for 11{.
   The Sunday Express newspaper reported 116 of the 334 Tory
lawmakers it contacted said they would vote for Major, 49 for
Heseltine and 34 for Hurd. Eighty-one had no comment and 54 said
they did not know, the newspaper said.
   Heseltine's challenge to Mrs. Thatcher in round one of the
ballot on Tuesday precipitated her departure. His campaign got a
boost Saturday with declared support from former Chancellor Nigel
Lawson and former deputy prime minister Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   Heseltine said later his chances of winning ``are getting better
by the phone call.''
   Howe resigned Nov. 1 in protest at Mrs. Thatcher's rejection of
a plan adopted by the 11 other European Community leaders to set up
a single central bank by 1994 and a single currency. Lawson
resigned in the middle of last year after a dispute rooted in the
same monetary issues.
   Major said 50 Tory lawmakers were working in his campaign team,
``and the reports we are getting from the constitutuencies are very
encouraging.'' He picked up support Saturday from Social Security
Secretary Tony Newton and Transport Minister Roger Freeman.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke declared his support for
Hurd.
   Hurd said he was even with Heseltine and added ``there will
certainly be a third ballot.''
   Heseltine won 152 votes in the first round against Mrs.
Thatcher's 204, with 16 abstentions. If none of the three
candidates receives a majority Tuesday, a third ballot will be held
Thursday.
   Opinion polls out Saturday showed Heseltine and Major were
likely to beat Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock if a general
election were held now. The Conservatives' chances of victory were
less under Hurd.
   The Conservatives trailed Labor, the main opposition party in
Parliament, for the last 16 months in opinion polls.
   An ICM poll for the Sunday Correspondent newspaper found that 47
percent of people would vote for Heseltine, compared with 38
percent who would vote Labor, according to the poll of 1,139 people
taken on Friday.
   Major received 46 percent of the vote, compared with 39 percent
for Labor and Hurd had 43 percent of the vote, compared with
Labor's 41 percent, the poll showed.
   A Market and Opinions Research International poll of 1,094
voters for the Sunday Times gave the Tories a six-point lead over
Labor with either Heseltine or Major as prime minister. Under Hurd
the Conservative margin would narrow to 2 percent, the poll found.
   A Gallup poll put the Tories under Heseltine at 47 percent
against Labor's 39 percent while the party under Major would
command 42.5 percent against Labor's 40 percent. Under Hurd the
Conservatives would be at 40.5 percent with Labor at 42 percent,
according to the poll of 1,063 people taken Friday for the Sunday
Telegraph.
   An NMR poll for the Independent on Sunday newspaper found the
Tories under Major would be on 48 percent to Labor's 40 percent
while under Heseltine the Conservatives would lead Labor 47 percent
to 42 percent. Under Hurd the two major parties would be even.
   No margin of error was given.

<HEAD>Head of Red Army in Germany Says 84 Soldiers Have Deserted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commander of the Soviet army in Germany said
84 soldiers had deserted in recent months, but he denied news
reports that black market dealing and mysterious deaths were
rampant among the troops.
   It was the first time the Soviets have provided figures on the
number of deserters.
   Gen. Boris Vasilievich Snetkov said 36 soldiers had left the
army and turned themselves in to German authorities. The other 48
were missing, he said.
   The 380,000 troops stationed in eastern Germany are the largest
contingent of the Red Army outside the Soviet Union. They are to be
withdrawn by 1994.
   Snetkov told a news conference that they face a ``relatively
tense'' situation in the planned pullout from Germany over the next
four years.
   But he denied reports that the contingent was falling apart,
plagued by low morale, internal fighting and mysterious deaths.
   Recently, German and Soviet officials have expressed concern
about the Soviet troops still stationed in Germany. Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev spoke of an ``anti-Soviet flavor''
during his meeting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn earlier this
month.
   The troops have become a bitter remnant of the Cold War
occupation, and many Germans are anxious to see them leave. The
soldiers, however, face an uncertain future at home, no guarantee
of housing and the loss of access to Western affluence and material
goods.
   Germany has promised $8 billion to the Soviet Union to help
finance the withdrawal.
   In an interview published Saturday in the eastern German daily
Junge Welt, a Soviet lawyer and human rights activist was quoted as
saying there were 800 deaths among Soviet troops in 1988 and that
he was investigating more than 2,000 deaths in ``mysterious
circumstances.''
   Oleg Liamin also was quoted as saying Soviet barracks operate
under a ``regime of terror'' where extortion and beatings among the
troops are common.
   Other reports in the German press have said that Red Army
soldiers, desperate for German marks, allegedly raid depots and
trade weapons and uniforms on the black market.
   Soviet privates are paid only $16 a month.
   Snetkov called the reports of black market trade ``a lie'' and
said the reported number of alleged deaths among the troops in
eastern Germany was ``ten times too high.'' The actual number is
about 100 a year, he said.
   ``We know our stay in this country brings inconveniences to the
people,'' he said. ``But the people must understand that the forces
must fulfill their training duties as army of the Soviet Union.''
   He said anti-Soviet sentiment by some Germans was only making
the pullout more difficult.
   He said many Soviet soldiers have been robbed by Germans.
   Closer contact between the Red Army and the Bundeswehr,
Germany's armed force, will ease tensions in the coming period, he
said.

   An early morning fire turned a commercial
stables into a ruin, killing more than 50 show and race horses here
Saturday.
   The fire broke out at about 4 a.m., apparently in one of two
wings that housed the horses. Fire officials said the cause of the
blaze was still under investigation, and said they had not ruled
out arson.
   Scott Laffey, who leased the Sabbath Day Farm and ran the
stables, said he dashed to the barn from his nearby home when he
heard a signal from an alarm. He blindfolded two horses and shooed
them out of the barn, but only four horses survived.
   ``A horse will run back into the stall,'' Laffey said. ``That's
the problem.''
   The intense heat razed one wing of the red barn, and destroyed
much of the second wing.
   ``The whole sky over there was just red,'' said Kathy Clemenzi,
a neighbor who could see the fire from her home. ``It just lit up
the sky.''
   ``It would be like an oven,'' said Police Chief Roger Merry.
   The charred carcasses of horses lay in rows where their stalls
had been. Fire officials and the farm's owner, Marshall Jespersen,
spent the morning photographing and identifying the remains. Laffey
said he was not sure exactly how many horses died, but estimated
about 55 were killed.
   The horses were worth between $5,000 and $35,000 apiece, Laffey
said. Merry estimated the total loss was worth more than $2
million.
   Firefighters had to bring in water tankers and pump water from a
nearby pond to douse the flames.
   Laffey said the fire accelerated quickly, leading him to wonder
whether it may have been set. No hay was stored in the barn. ``In
my heart, I believe it took off too fast,'' he said. Merry said
investigators ``have not drawn conclusions one way or another'' on
whether arson was involved.
   Horse owners who had lodged and trained their animals at the
farm came to survey the damage. Matthew Morton said his brother and
sister-in-law, a New Hampshire couple who were housing three horses
while they were on a trip, were heartbroken.
   ``They'd just absolutely fallen in love with those horses,''
Morton said.
   Said Kathy Borylo, who trained horses at the farm: ``My
customers are all devastated.''

<TEXT>
   Defying international appeals, Japan launched the
fourth season of its controversial research whaling program
Saturday with plans to kill up to 330 whales.
   Environmentalists charge the program is a cover for continued
commercial whaling.
   The mother ship Nisshin Maru No. 3 left Saturday for the
Antarctic Ocean, where it is to be joined by three smaller boats
for four months of whaling, Kyodo News Service reported.
   They officially plan to catch 300 minke whales, a relatively
abundant smaller species. The research program allows up to 330
animals to be killed.
   In July, Japan, Norway and Iceland appealed unsuccessfully at a
meeting of the International Whaling Commission for minkes to be
excluded from the commission's moratorium on commercial whaling.
   Nobuyuki Yagi, a Fishery Agency official, said Japan hopes
information about minke populations gathered by the fleet this
season will encourage the commission to re-evaluate the moratorium,
instituted in 1986 after many of the great whale species were
hunted close to extinction.
   Japanese officials say whales must be killed during the research
to accurately determine their age, sex, childbearing state, diet
and health.
   Environmentalists say non-lethal research methods are available,
such as skin samplings and sighting studies.
   Japan officially stopped its commercial whaling at the end of
the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 whales. It then began a
program of research whaling, which is permitted under the whaling
commission's charter.
   Japanese whalers killed 273 animals in the first year of the
research program, 241 in the second and 330 in the third.
   At its meeting this year, the commission passed non-binding
resolutions questioning whether Japan's research program was
scientifically accurate and urging it to use non-lethal methods
wherever possible, officials said.
   Although Japanese whaling officials previously said at least 825
whales must be caught each year to make the program scientifically
valid, Japanese experts recalculated the sampling error in response
to the IWC resolutions and determined that 300 was sufficient, Yagi
said.
   Japan also appealed at the IWC meeting for permission to hunt 50
minke whales commercially each year along its coast, saying small
traditional whaling communities had been damaged by the moratorium,
Yagi said. But that proposal also was rejected.
   The minke reaches about 30 feet in length and eight tons in
weight, and is the smallest of the commercially sought great
whales. The commission estimates there are about 760,000 minkes in
the Antarctic and about 83,000 in the North Atlantic.
   Officials say whaling also is an important part of the Japanese
diet and culture. Japan is the world's largest consumer of whale
meat, and whales provided 23 percent of the nation's meat when
Japanese whaling was at its peak in the early 1960s.
   Whale meat is now considered a delicacy because of its limited
supply.

<HEAD>Christian Militia Begins Pullout From Beirut</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The main Christian militia started
withdrawing its heavy weapons from east Beirut on Saturday,
removing the last major obstacle to President Elias Hrawi's
demilitarization of the capital.
   The move by the Lebanese Forces militia was ``the first phase in
a 48-hour total withdrawal from east Beirut,'' a spokesman for the
militia said.
   The pullout began five days after a Nov. 19 deadline set by
Hrawi in his effort to create a militia-free zone in the so-called
``Greater Beirut'' area. The pullot is the first phase of an Arab
League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's 15{-year-old civil war.
   Private militias have been blamed for most of the estimated
150,000 deaths during the fighting, and their forces had siphoned
off taxes from a weakened and divided central government.
   The major Moslem militias withdrew before the deadline. But the
Lebanese Forces, led by Samir Geagea, refused to leave until rival
pro-Syrian Christians and other Syrian-backed forces returned
Lebanese Forces offices they had seized. Geagea also demanded
guarantees that the pro-Syrian forces would not be allowed into
east Beirut after the Lebanese Forces withdrew.
   The pro-Syrian Christian forces are led by Geagea's bitter
rival, Elie Hobeika. A Geagea spokesman, who declined to be
identified, said the Lebanese Forces demands had been met, with the
government ordering the anti-Hobeika Fifth Brigade of the army to
police most of east Beirut.
   Militiamen of the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces loaded mortars,
machine guns, recoilless cannons and cases of ammunition onto 30
trucks near their headquarters in the seaside district of
Karantina.
   The convoy headed north along the coastal boulevard to Kesrouan
province, which lies outside the ``Greater Beirut'' area.
   The spokesman said the militia will evacuate some 400 fighters,
40 tanks and 50 armored personnel carriers from Beirut's Christian
sector.
   Government troops will move into metropolitan Beirut's
Karantina, Nabaa and Ashrafiyeh districts, traditional Lebanese
Forces strongholds, ``as our pullout proceeds,'' the spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
   When the operation was completed Monday, these districts ``will
be in the hands of the Lebanese army,'' he said.
   The Greater Beirut zone will cover a 15-mile coastal stretch
from the Dog River in the north to the Damour River in the south
and extend east and northeast to encompass part of the Christian
heartland that had been controlled by rebel Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Aoun had defied Hrawi for 11 months until the president's Syrian
allies crushed his mutiny last month.
   Hrawi hopes to disband the militias and extend long-absent state
authority over all of Lebanon.
   But disarming the militias who have long held sway will be a
formidable task.
   Another complication is Israel's occupation of a border strip in
southern Lebanon. Israel has made clear it will not pull out of its
self-declared ``security zone'' while anti-Israeli armed factions
roam freely in southern Lebanon.

   A pair of dueling tattoo parlors is
giving this rural Maine town's local business scene a shot in the
arm.
   Both businesses began within the last two months, and despite
the region's sluggish economy, both report a booming demand for
body art.
   ``Customers are coming out of the woodwork now,'' said
43-year-old Roy Whitney, who opened Whitney's Creative Tattoos in
an old key shop.
   Part of the reason business is brisk may be the fact that
tattooing is illegal in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, he
said.
   Richie Slamm, 53, who operates Mithras Tattoos, boasts 97
tattoos of his own. Slamm learned his trade at New York's Coney
Island during the 1950s when the process was still legal, doing his
first tattoo when he was 12.
   Whitney, a former construction worker, got into the business
three years ago after he was injured on his old job.
   Though they're business rivals, Whitney, who wears 20 tattoos,
and Slamm have artistic respect for each other. Slamm is working on
a jungle scene that will eventually cover Whitney's back. It
features a panther leaping through the flesh into a forest of
tangled vines and waiting predators.
   Both men plan to hire assistants so they can keep up with
people's demand for colorful unicorns, dragons, daggers and
rainbows to adorn their bodies.
   As an added draw, they are offering holiday gift certificates.

   About 30,000 demonstrators rallied to
back embattled Premier Andrei Lukanov on Saturday, one day after he
narrowly survived a no-confidence vote. Government opponents
blocked a main boulevard in protest.
   Some fights broke out between government supporters and
opponents but hundreds of police intervened to prevent serious
clashes.
   Lukanov told the crowd Saturday that he was ``no coward'' and
accused the opposition of trying ``to establish a new political
monopoly.'' Lukanov is among a group of former Communists who
toppled longtime ruler Todor Zhivkov last year and oversaw
parliamentary elections.
   The no-confidence vote Friday followed months of wrangling
between the former Communists and the opposition on how to turn
around the moribund economy and end the country's political
paralysis.
   The government's failure to stop the economic decline and
improve supplies of scarce foods and consumer goods has led to
growing demands for Lukanov's resignation from frustrated citizens.
   An official survey broadcast on television Saturday said Lukanov
had a 50 percent approval rating. Last month, 71 percent supported
him.
   Despite surviving the confidence vote, Lukanov's government
faces more pressure by the main opposition alliance, the Union of
Democratic Forces, which has called for a mass demonstration in
Sofia on Sunday.
   The opposition trade union confederation Podkrepa has called a
general strike for Monday if Lukanov does not resign by then,
despite a warning by the prosecutor general that political strikes
are not permitted.
   The government issued a statement Saturday on television
demanding the strike be called off, saying it would ``endanger our
parliamentary system ... intensify the political instability, and
have an extremely detrimental effect on the international prestige
of our young democracy.''
   The main trade union confederation announced it would not
support the strike.
   Opponents seeking Lukanov's resignation demonstrated in Sofia
every day last week.
   But on Saturday, government supporters gathered outside the
fire-damaged headquarters of the Socialist Party to cheer Lukanov,
who declared he would not resign under pressure.
   The building, which housed the former Communist Party before it
became the Socialist Party early this year, was set afire by
anti-Communist demonstrators in August.
   About 2,000 opposition supporters gathered within sight of the
Socialist-sponsored rally, chanting slogans against Lukanov and his
party.
   A thick line of police equipped with riot gear separated the two
demonstrations but some scuffles erupted when the pro-government
rally began to disperse.
   Several hundred opposition supporters blocked the capital's main
boulevard by sitting or lying in the road to block the way of
pro-government demonstrators.
   Helmeted police with nightsticks called on the protesters to
clear the street, but refrained from using force to disperse them.
After about an hour the police withdrew and the protesters
dispersed peacefully.
   Opposition leaders claim they would triumph in new elections.
They have repeatedly rejected Lukanov's requests to join a broad
Socialist-led coalition government, insisting instead on naming the
premier and holding key ministries.
   The Socialist Party won free elections in June and holds 210
seats in Parliament. The opposition Union has 144 seats.
   Lukanov repeated he was open to dialogue with the opposition and
reiterated his determination to push through badly needed reforms
to turn around the failing economy.
   However, he warned that he could not promise ``easy days'' under
the tough reforms. ``The program will be difficult, even cruel.''

<HEAD>Thearapists Cancel 1992 Minneapolis Convention To Protest Abortion
Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Family Therapy Association has
canceled plans to hold its 1992 convention in Minneapolis to
protest a state law requiring teen-age girls to notify their
parents before having an abortion.
   The group objects to the 1981 law which also mandates that
minors seek a judge's permission if they want to avoid notifying
their parents. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law in June.
   The cancellation means a loss of nearly $180,000 to the local
economy, according to Peter Hedlund, vice president of the Greater
Minneapolis Convention and Visitors Association. That figure is
based on attendance of 300 conventioneers.
   Marilyn Mason, a Minneapolis psychologist and a member of the
American Family Therapy Association board, said Friday that the
board decided by a ``100 percent consensus'' to boycott Minneapolis
when it learned of the Minnesota law during a Massachusetts retreat
in September.
   ``Since our organization opposes government interference in the
reproductive decisions of Americans, especially those that deny
poor Americans their right to privacy, we cannot, in good
conscience, have our convention in Minnesota,'' Mason wrote in a
letter to the editor of the Star Tribune.
   Rachael Hare-Muftin, the association's president, told
Minneapolis Mayor Don Fraser and St. Paul Mayor Jim Scheibel of the
cancellation in separate letters.
   ``My impression is that the law we have doesn't work very well,
but it's the Legislature that's got the responsibility,'' Fraser
said.
   Greg Ortale, president of the convention and visitors
association, said: ``If that's the way they feel, they should go
with their beliefs.''
   The law was in effect five years before a challenge by several
abortion clinics led U.S. District Judge Donald Alsop to declare it
unconstitutional in 1986.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later ruled that the law
was valid but blocked its enforcement pending a U.S. Supreme Court
review.
   In June, the nation's high court ruled that states do not impose
an ``undue burden'' on pregnant girls by requiring them to notify
parents or receive court permission if they don't want to tell
their parents. After the Supreme Court's ruling, the Minnesota law
was reinstated Aug. 27.

   An Israeli gunboat sank a dinghy off the
Lebanese coast Saturday, killing five armed guerrillas who were
apparently en route to attack an Israeli target, according to radio
reports and military sources.
   It was not immediately known if there were any survivors from
the dinghy, Israeli radio reported. It said there were no Israeli
casualties.
   The Israeli military had no official statement on the incident
late Saturday, but military sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, confirmed the sinking and said it was under
investigation.
   Reports on Israel radio and broadcasts in Beirut said the
guerrillas were planning an attack in Israel.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation and the Christian Voice of
Lebanon said the dinghy sank off Saadiyat, about 12 miles south of
Beirut.
   They did not identify the guerrillas killed or provide any other
details.
   The reported clash came four days after Israeli troops and
allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army ambushed a Palestinian
guerrilla squad in southeast Lebanon.
   Police and the Israeli command said four guerrillas and an
Israeli officer were killed in the eight-hour firefight near the
village of Ain Atta, in the foothills of Mount Hermon.
   The Libyan-backed Palestine Popular Struggle Front, a small
radical group of Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization,
identified the guerrillas in that battle as members of its force.
   An abortive attack on an Israeli beach by seaborne guerrillas in
May prompted the United States to cut off its 18-month dialogue
with the PLO. That attempt was claimed by an Iraqi-backed group,
the Palestine Liberation Front.

<TEXT>
   Elections planned in Yucatan state on Sunday
have been promoted as a showcase of the government's new tolerance
of rival parties, even as it fights widespread allegations of fraud
in other regions.
   The voting comes on the eve of a visit by President Bush to the
northern city of Monterrey to discuss a free trade pact, part of
the economic and political opening announced by President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
   About 650,000 voters are registered to cast ballots for 106
mayoral posts and 25 state deputies in Yucatan. Six parties are
competing in the rural southeastern state, famous for the Mayan
ruins of Chichen Itza and others, but polls indicate the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has strong support
across the state.
   ``In Yucatan, there are all the conditions to have clean and
democratic elections,'' Gov. Victor Manzanilla Schaeffer was quoted
as saying by the government news agency Notimex last week.
   He said those who failed to understand that the Mexican election
system had changed ``will be exposed publicly.''
   Salinas took office in December 1988 and has promised to clean
up Mexican elections. In 1989, the government recognized an
opposition party victory in a gubernatorial race for the first time
in decades.
   But opposition figures claim the government has repeatedly
resorted to fraud in other state elections by organizing caravans
of illegal voters, ballot box theft and inaccurate voter rolls.
   In Yucatan, polls by the private surveying agencies Opina and
Con-Ciencia indicated a strong PRI lead throughout the state.
Con-Ciencia noted, however, that 47 percent of the registered
voters surveyed refused to give an opinion.
   The PRI, in power for more than 60 years, is far more organized
than the opposition and has more rewards to give backers in the
form of jobs, favors and government spending.
   It is also the only party running in all 106 municipalities,
including 32 where it is unopposed.
   The leftist Mexico City daily La Jornada reported that
opposition parties saw little chance to win more than 20 of the
mayoral races.
   Members of the conservative National Action Party and the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party told the state election
commission Friday there were signs of impending vote fraud.
   They charged the government has issued two conflicting lists of
polling locations and districts which could allow people to vote
twice.
   They also complained that the PRI-dominated electoral commission
rejected 60 poll watchers from the National Action Party and 45
observers from the Democratic Revolution Party.
   The daily El Universal said the opposition proposed having
electoral commission members sign individual ballots at the close
of voting to prevent additions of forged ballots later.
   National Action and Democratic Revolution parties have boycotted
meetings of the federal Electoral College, which is certifying
results of the Nov. 11 elections in Mexico and Hidalgo states, to
protest alleged fraud.
   Preliminary official results gave the PRI 116 of 121 mayoral
contests in Mexico state, where it lost in 1988 presidential
voting. They also gave the PRI 81 of 84 mayoral spots in the
east-central state of Hidalgo.

<HEAD>Protest Over Airline Fare Increase Blocks Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Easter Islanders protesting a doubling of
the air fare to the mainland stormed the island's only landing
strip, blocking a flight carrying 200 tourists, authorities said
Saturday.
   The Chilean carrier LAN canceled the flight to Tahiti until at
least Monday, when airline officials are scheduled to discuss the
fare hike with the governor of the South Pacific island.
   LAN, the only airline operating to the island, increased the
round-trip fare from the island to the Chilean mainland from $206
to $410.
   The island with a population of 2,000, annexed by Chile in 1888,
is about 2,300 miles west of Santiago. It is famous for giant stone
carvings of heads and hieroglyphs, whose origins are the subject of
debate.
   The protest began Friday when a group of mostly young islanders
blocked the jet as it prepared to take off.
   Some of the protesters remained on the landing strip Saturday,
police said. Several had parked trucks and cars to prevent the
airplane from taking off.
   Island officials pleaded with the protesters to clear the strip.
Airline officials said they agreed to a meeting Monday with the
island's governor, Jacobo Hei, and said the fare increase may be
reversed.
   But Interior Minister Enrique Krauss said the government will
not subsidize the fare, ``because residents in other remote areas
would certainly ask for a similar treatment, and we can not do
that.''

   Peace activists took to the streets of several
European and North American cities Saturday to demand that Western
nations pull their military forces from the Persian Gulf.
   Protesters marched through central London and held a
demonstration in Hyde Park.
   Police estimated the crowd at about 5,000. But the organizers,
the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said it was three times that.
   The marchers carried placards saying ``Out of the Gulf'' and
chanted anti-war slogans.
   British officials announced Thursday that Britain would send
14,000 more men to the gulf after Christmas. There now are 16,000
British troops in the region as part of a multinational force
deployed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August.
   At Saturday's protest in London, Labor Party lawmaker and
veteran peace campaigner Tony Benn told the crowd that opposition
to a military option in the gulf was growing.
   ``World opposition to the gulf war is growing so rapidly that
humanity has the best chance ever of forcing a superpower to accept
a peaceful solution. That is why our campaign is so important
now,'' he said.
   Benn was to leave Sunday for Baghdad. He said he would try to
negotiate a peaceful solution to the crisis and the release of
foreign hostages held by Iraq.
   In a separate protest in Bonn, about 6,000 people carrying
banners saying ``No Blood for Oil'' rallied.
   The demonstration was organized by the Greens party and other
leftist groups.
   Police seized leaflets passed out by Greens officials urging
German soldiers to desert in case they were sent to the gulf.
   German officials say the country's constitution prevents the
government from sending troops outside NATO areas, and there are no
German soldiers with the international force in Saudi Arabia.
   But Chancellor Helmut Kohl has said he will seek a
constitutional amendment that will allow Germany to participate in
military actions sponsored by the United Nations.
   Other leaflets distributed at the rally condemned ``the brutal
regime'' of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, his aggression against
Kuwait and the taking of foreign hostages. But the leaflets said
this was not reason enough to plunge the gulf region into a war
that would cause massive loss of life.
   In Toronto, about 200 people rallied outside the U.S. Consulate
and then marched to city hall Saturday to protest the Western
military buildup in the gulf.
   Chanting ``Hell, no, we won't go; we won't die for Texaco!'' the
group marched in a light snowfall and made their way down
University Avenue with a police escort.
   The protesters were part of a loose coalition of several groups
that oppose the U.S. and Canadian military presence in the gulf.
They called for an immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops in
the region.
   In Ottawa, about 200 peace activists gathered at the National
War Memorial on Parliament Hill to protest Canada's involvement in
the gulf.
   About 1,500 Canadian troops are in the region. The United States
has about 230,000 soldiers there.
   In Newark, N.J, a small group of activists protested against the
presence of U.S. troops in the gulf, saying poor blacks are
unfairly sent abroad to fight a rich man's war for oil.
   Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the New Jersey Rainbow Coalition,
said a disproportionately large number of black solders were sent
to the Middle East to take part in the multinational force.
   The 16 protestors plan to repeat the demonstration monthly until
the soldiers come home, Hamm said.

   A beeper at his waist saved a man from
a bullet fired while he fought a masked gunman in an underground
garage, police said.
   Three more shots went off during the struggle Friday and the
last one hit the gunman, killing him. The dead man was identified
as Vernon Justice, 23, of Inglewood, Detective Bill Collette said.
The names of the 19-year-old woman and 25-year-old man who were
accosted were withheld.
   Justice died at Long Beach Memorial Hospital shortly after being
shot once in the chest at 9 p.m.
   Wearing a ski mask and rubber gloves, the gunman grabbed the
woman in the garage beneath an apartment building, Collette said.
   ``He put an arm around her throat, covered her mouth with his
hand and put a gun to her head, and asked, `Which car is yours?'''
said Detective Logan Wrenn.
   The boyfriend then entered the garage and the gunman let go of
the woman, Collette said.
   The boyfriend grabbed for the gun. It went off but the shot was
deflected by the beeper, Collette said. One shot hit the garage
floor and a second punctured a car tire. The third hit Justice.
   The district attorney's office will review the police reports,
Collette said, adding he believed the boyfriend acted ``in
self-defense and in defense of his girlfriend.''

<HEAD>Ground Computer Problem That Interrupted Venus Mapping Is Fixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers corrected a ground control
computer error which halted the Magellan spacecraft's mapping of
Venus, NASA officials said Saturday.
   ``Everything is fine,'' said Bob MacMillan, spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   The problem was corrected about 8 a.m. Saturday, 2{ hours before
the start of the next mapping cycle.
   ``It was a rather minor disconnect last night because of some
command errors transmitted from the ground. The spacecraft didn't
recognize a series of commands and decided to put itself in a safe
position,'' MacMillan said. ``It did not break communications the
way it did in August, it just reduced its information rate. It sent
back slow signals, but no mapping data.''
   The spacecraft, which circles Venus every three hours and 15
minutes, ``lost about three orbits,'' after it stopped mapping
about 8 p.m. Friday, he said.
   It was the second report of problems with Magellan's mapping
mission in eight days. The Magellan signal was lost for 40 minutes
Nov. 15. Signals were lost twice in August.
   Engineers have lost contact with Magellan three times for
reasons not yet fully understood, but believed to be electric
static interfering with a spacecraft computer.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May, 4,
1989. It went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally
started its $744 million mapping mission Sept. 15.

<HEAD>Talks Hint at Improved Ties Between Britain and Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and Syria may soon restore
diplomatic relations, the official news agency in Damascus reported
Saturday. Ties were cut four years ago over Syria's alleged support
of terrorists.
   The thaw may also raise hopes for the release of some of the 13
Westerners held by pro-Iranian Moslem extremists in Lebanon, where
Syria has about 40,000 troops.
   An editorial in the Syrian government newspaper Tishrin earlier
this month linked the release of hostages with restoration of
Anglo-Syrian relations.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency said Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa conferred Saturday with David Gore-Booth, a
British Foreign Office official.
   The Foreign Office in London confirmed that Gore-Booth,
undersecretary responsible for relations with the Middle East, was
``discussing bilateral problems that prevent the resumption of
diplomatic ties.''
   The meeting was held shortly after the Syrian minister returned
home with President Hafez Assad from Geneva, where Assad and
President Bush discussed the Persian Gulf crisis Friday.
   The Tishrin newspaper, which normally reflects government
thinking, held Britain's outgoing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
responsible for blocking improved ties. Mrs. Thatcher announced her
resignation last week.
   It was the first public contact between British and Syrian
government officials since November 1986, when London severed
relations after accusing Syria of masterminding an attempt to blow
up an Israeli jetliner at Heathrow Airport outside London seven
months earlier.
   In December 1988, a Damascus-based radical group, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, was
implicated in an explosion aboard a Pan Am jumbo jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
   However, no one has been prosecuted for the attack, which killed
270 people. Later reports from U.S. intelligence and other sources
blamed Libyan and Iranian terrorists for the Pan Am bombing.
   The Tishrin newspaper had criticized Mrs. Thatcher for taking no
steps toward improving ties after Syria sided with the Western
alliance against Iraq following the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   It also attacked Britain for allegedly pressuring its 11
partners in the European Community to maintain sanctions against
Syria, which deprived Damascus of an annual $192 million
development loan and restricted the number of Syrian diplomats
allowed to work in EC capitals.
   The U.S. State Department still lists Syria as one of the main
Middle East countries that sponsor terrorism and violate human
rights.
   However, U.S. officials had publicly thanked Syria for helping
secure the release of American hostages Robert Polhill and Frank
Reed in Lebanon last April. Ireland said Syria helped free Brian
Keenan, an Irish citizen, in August.
   The 13 remaining hostages include six Americans, four Britons,
two Germans and an Italian. The longest-held Western hostage in
Lebanon is Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent Terry
Anderson, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Body of Flight Instructor Recovered From Helicopter Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWTON, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army divers on Saturday recovered the body
of a civilian flight instructor who disappeared last week when a
military helicopter crashed into a lake during a night training
exercise, authorities said.
   Phillip E. Walker's body was found about two hours after an Army
helicopter raised the wreckage of the smaller aircraft from the
bottom of Lake Ellsworth.
   ``He was doing his job. He was doing a risky job and he paid the
ultimate price,'' said Maj. Chuck Pope, a Fort Sill spokesman.
   The 54-year-old Walker of Sheridan, Ark., was one of six crew
members aboard the UHV-1 helicopter when it crashed Thursday on a
night training mission over the lake just north of Fort Sill.
   The other five, reservists from Little Rock, Ark., escaped
serious injury and were rescued from the water by lakeshore
residents.
   ``The helicopter was in one piece with the exception of the
rotor that was broken off,'' Sheila Samples, a Fort Sill spokesman,
said of the wreckage. ``There was nothing in the helicopter.''
   The crash's cause is unknown and under investigation.
   Walker, a pilot for 25 years, was a maintenance facility manager
for the Army at Little Rock. He was at Fort Sill training the 374th
Air Ambulance Company. The Little Rock reserve unit was activated
as part of Operation Desert Shield, the deployment of U.S. troops
in Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.

emergency shelters reopened Saturday as rain-swollen rivers spilled
over and drove close to 2,000 people from their homes in the second
wave of floods this season.
   The hardest hit areas were in western Washington.
   At least 19 rivers were at flood stage Saturday because of heavy
rainfall in the Cascade Mountains, the National Weather Service
said. Between 6 and 9 inches of rain had fallen in the mountains in
24 hours.
   As many as 15 highways were closed in places. Major road
closures included U.S. 101 near Lake Crescent on the Olympic
Peninsula and U.S. 2, a major east-west route across the state.
   The flooding Cedar River closed the Renton Municipal Airport.
   For the second time in only two weeks, scores of residents of
Fir Island, about 50 miles north of Seattle, were evacuated as the
rising waters of the Skagit River broke through a dike damaged in
the first wave of floods.
   ``I think we have to assume the worst at this point because the
levees are in such tough shape,'' said Mark Stewart, spokesman for
the state Division of Emergency Management. ``They suffered a lot
of damage in the floods two weeks and they have continued to stay
saturated.
   ``It's a very serious situation. We're very concerned.''
   The Red Cross opened emergency shelters in affected areas and
the state dispatched its last 35,000 sandbags to flood fighters.
   The state has already gone through a stockpile of 100,000
sandbags since Veterans Day weekend. Another 150,000 were on order,
but were yet to arrive.
   ``We are literally scouring the countryside to come up with
additional sandbags,'' said Dick Milne, another spokesman for the
state rescue agency. ``We've had so much rain in last two weeks -
and especially in the last 24 hours - the ground is saturated and
it can't go anywhere.''
   Evacuations along the Skagit River could involve as many as
1,200 people, based on estimations of the number who fled two weeks
ago.
   That first floods inflicted more than $40 million damage in
Skagit, Snohomish and Whatcom counties. Gov. Booth Gardner has
requested emergency federal aid for victims of that flooding.
   Nearly 500 people were evacuated from Fir Island during the
earlier flooding, which submerged 8,000 acres of farmland. Many who
had returned to begin cleaning up their homes were forced out again
Saturday.
   Don Nieshe, 37, said he and hi family had been unable to return
to their island home since the first flood and were staying with
relatives on high ground.
   He was at the scene Saturday, surveying the damage in hip boots.
The family's bicycles were loaded in a rowboat.
   ``There's nothing we can do. Everything's a mess inside,''
Nieshe said.
   The swollen Skagit River topped the island dike and created a
150-foot hole at the same point where water forced a 300-foot gap
two weeks ago, undoing repair efforts.
   The Army Corps of Engineers planned to airdrop thousands of
sandbags to fill the break.
   Upriver, nearly 700 people were evacuated from the rural
communities of Hamilton, Cape Horn, Thunderbird and Allen.
   High waters between Monroe and Sultan closed an 8-mile stretch
of State Highway 2. The rising Stillaguamish River lapped at the
edges of Interstate 5.
   While rivers were rising north and east of Seattle, the state's
largest city was unaffected, Milne said.
   There are no large rivers in the city, and a drop in elevation
forces river water through Seattle quickly, not allowing it to
spread beyond the river banks.

<HEAD>Professors Allegations of Admissions Bias Provokes Berkeley Student
Outrage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs posted around the University of
California-Berkeley campus last week expressed student outrage over
a professor's charges of admissions discrimination against whites
and Orientals.
   The debate over the views of anthropology Professor Vincent
Sarich has grown into a controversy involving the campus chancellor
and questions of free speech and academic freedom.
   The dispute came to a head Nov. 7 when some 75 people burst into
Sarich's lecture with shouts and chants. The session was cut short.
   Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien has threatened expulsions of students,
warning that further disruptions would not be tolerated. He also
asked for an investigation.
   He further warned that if a complaint about Sarich's alleged
``discriminatory remarks'' were issued, a ``careful review'' of
Sarich would follow.
   The warning alarmed faculty members who said they're concerned
their courses might become limited to what is considered
politically correct.
   ``Many of us disagree vehemently with some of the things Sarich
says, but I have concern about this sort of thing getting out of
hand,'' said anthropology Professor Brent Berlin.
   The controversy started after Sarich wrote an article in the
fall for the UC alumni magazine. Sarich, a molecular
anthropologist, said UC-Berkeley admissions policies ``have
systematically, and increasingly, discriminated against white
students and institutionalized racism on our campus.''
   He said thousands of white and Asian students with perfect 4.0
grade point averages and high test scores had been denied admission
to UC-Berkeley in the name of diversifying the student body.
   Sarich, 55, teaches what he admits are unpopular theories about
human evolution, including the possibility that brain size might
make a difference in intelligence, and that race may make a
difference in ability.
   He told a reporter that he teaches biological factors that
influence but don't necessarily determine differences. ``If there
are any differences, they have got to be absolutely minimal as
compared to ethnic and cultural differences,'' he said.
   Sarich said most of his students defended him after the
classroom disruption, even though they may not have agreed with all
of his views.
   ``They (the protesters) were locked onto the idea that something
he was saying was racist, sexist, or homophobic ... They simply
didn't know anything about what Sarich was teaching or saying,''
one of his students wrote.
   But English Professor David Lloyd, who had debated Sarich in the
alumni journal, called Sarich ``profoundly irresponsible for what
he's saying.''

<HEAD>Regional Groups Seeks U.N. Chief's Help to Halt Salvadoran
Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials from El Salvador and
four other nations Saturday asked the U.N. secretary-general to
help halt a 5-day-old offensive that has left more than 100 people
dead.
   At least two government soldiers died in skirmishes with leftist
rebels in the eastern Usulutan province Saturday, but El Salvador's
13 other provinces appeared calm.
   In Honduras, the Central American Security Commission issued a
statement asking U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
help end the offensive by the rebels of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation, or FMLN. They asked Perez de Cuellar to make
personal efforts to persuade the rebels to call off their attacks.
   The group - which includes top officials from Guatemala, El
Salvador, Honduaras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica - said ``the
bellicose actions of the FMLN constitute an obstacle'' to peace
efforts in the region.
   The Armed Forces Press Committee in El Salvador reported
fighting Saturday between rebels and soldiers in Santa Elena and El
Triunfo, about 65 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   Two soldiers were killed in the Santa Elena fighting, according
to the report. There were no casualties reported from El Triunfo.
   The committee said government troops in the northeastern
province of Morazan discovered two graves containing the bodies of
at least 12 guerrillas killed earlier in the week.
   Those graves - nine bodies near Lolotiquillo and three others
outside Chilanga - pushed the week's death toll above 100.
   According to the most recent figures, 41 government soldiers, 56
rebels and eight civilians have been killed since Tuesday. An
estimated 300 people have been wounded.
   The Santa Elena fighting was three miles from where the rebels
on Friday shot down a government A-37 fighter-bomber.
   The government said the aircraft was downed with a
Soviet-designed surface-to-air missile. The plane's pilot was
killed, but the co-pilot ejected and was reported recovering from
burns.
   Human rights groups estimate that 73,000 people have been killed
in the decade-old civil war.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III failed
Saturday to gain immediate support from Colombia and Malaysia for a
proposed U.N. resolution authorizing the use of force to oust Iraq
from Kuwait.
   Both countries are key non-aligned members of the U.N. Security
Council.
   ``We had a very good meeting. They're going to study the
proposals that we have talked about, the things that we have
consulted with other countries about, and they will be back in
touch with us,'' Baker said of his meeting in Los Angeles with
Malaysian foreign minister Abu Hassan.
   ``Can't count votes until they're cast,'' Baker said.
   Hassan said he offered Baker ``no promises,'' but said he would
discuss the matter with the rest of Malaysia's cabinet ministers on
Wednesday.
   ``We are good friends of the Arab countries, both sides of Arab
countries, Iraq and Saudi,'' Hassan said.
   Earlier Saturday, Baker met with Colombian President Cesar
Gaviria and other officials during a four-hour visit to the South
American nation. Afterward, Foreign Minister Luis Jaramillo said
Colombia had not decided how it would vote on such a resolution.
   Colombia, one of 10 non-permanent members of the 15-member
Security Council, has voted in favor of all 10 previous
resolutions, which include a call for Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait
and a trade embargo on Baghdad.
   But Jaramillo, speaking at a news conference with Baker, seemed
to reject a military option against Iraq, saying: ``Finding
peaceful solutions to conflicts is a fundamental thesis within
Colombia foreign policy.''
   He said, however, that Colombia stands firm with the world
community in rejecting Iraqi aggression.
   Baker, whose visit Saturday was the last leg of a five-day tour
of Security Council member states, said prospects for an immediate
solution to the Persian Gulf crisis were not good.
   ``Perhaps the best way to achieve a peaceful solution is not to
rule out the use of force. It may be the only thing Saddam Hussein
understands,'' Baker told reporters.
   He did not indicate if the United States has enough support in
the Security Council to pass such a resolution.
   He said prospects were not good for an immediate solution to the
crisis: ``So far we see no withdrawal and in fact we see no
inclination of Saddam Hussein to withdraw.''
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 in a dispute over land, oil and
money. About 350,000 troops from 26 nations are massed in Saudi
Arabia against 460,000 Iraqi troops deployed in southern Iraq and
Kuwait.
   In Beijing, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
said Saturday the Security Council could pass the proposed
resolution on using force against Iraq before the end of this week.
   He spoke after meeting with Chinese leaders on the gulf crisis,
but made it clear that his view did not result from his discussions
with them.
   China has refused to say how it would vote on a resolution on
military force. As one of the five permanent Security Council
members, China has veto power over resolutions. The other permanent
members are Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United
States.
   A day earlier, Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said
the U.N. Security Council probably would meet next week to discuss
the issue. It was the first indication enough support had been
gathered for the measure.
   The Soviet Union's U.N. envoy also said Friday that Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze would attend a Security Council
meeting next week to discuss Iraqi aggression - and to issue a
``strong, serious and precise warning'' to Baghdad.

<TEXT>
   Somali rebels claim they captured a
strategic southern town and attacked a Kenyan border trading post.
   The claim could not be immediately verified from other sources.
   A clandestine radio broadcast by the Somali National Movement,
the main rebel group, said Somali Patriotic Movement fighters were
in control of the Indian Ocean port of Kisimaio. It also said the
rebels staged attacks on Liboi, a Kenyan town about 110 miles
northwest of the port.
   The Friday broadcast, monitored in Nairobi, said ``large-scale
attacks'' were made on government bases at Kisimaio and rebels
``captured the town and its surrounding area.'' It said ``a similar
attack'' was waged on Liboi.
   Kisimaio is about 220 miles south of Mogadishu, the Somali
capital.
   The broadcast did not say when the fighting began.
   Attempts to reach officials by telephone in Somalia's capital of
Mogadishu to verify the rebel claims were unsuccessful.
   A man who identified himself only as the duty officer at the
Kenya police headquarters said ``we have no reports of any attack
at Liboi.''
   The patriotic movement is led by renegade army Col. Omar Joss
and became active in southern Somalia last year. Another insurgency
group, the United Somali Congress, holds much of the central part
of the nation.
   The rebels seek the ouster of President Mohamed Siad Barre.
   On Wednesday, the rebels said they would not go to Cairo, Egypt,
next month for peace talks with government representatives.
   Butros Ghalis, Egypt's foreign affairs minister, had earlier
announced the talks were scheduled for Dec. 12 and that delegates
would attend from Italy, Somalia's former colonial ruler.
   But a rebel broadcast said the guerrillas control most of
Somalia ``and are not in the business of begging from anyone.''

   Thousands of Poles in Chicago helped shape their
homeland's future Saturday by casting absentee ballots in the first
presidential election since communism's collapse in Poland.
   ``We are all very happy about the turnout so far. It is
difficult to say how many will come,'' Andrzej Jaroszynski, a
Polish consul in Chicago, said about midday.
   He estimated upwards of 15,000 - out of some 40,000 Chicago area
Poles eligible to vote in the Polish elections - would cast
ballots.
   Chicago has the largest bloc of Poles of any city outside
Warsaw, about 800,000 to 1.2 million.
   Poland allows naturalized U.S. citizens to hold Polish passports
and vote. Newly arrived immigrants and visitors to the United
States also can vote.
   About 400,000 Poles in the United States were eligible to cast
ballots Saturday, a day before the general election in Poland,
officials said.
   The contest pits labor leader and Solidarity Party founder Lech
Walesa against Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and four lesser
known candidates.
   The U.S. returns could prove important if the vote is close in
Poland, where more than 27 million people are eligible to vote.
   At the least, a high U.S. turnout would encourage the same in
Poland, said Chicago Alderman Roman C. Pucinski, a Walesa backer
who represents the heavily Polish 41st Ward on the city's northwest
side.
   ``If there's a good turnout, you will have a bandwagon effect,''
Pucinski said as he stood in front of the Polish American Congress,
one of three polling places in the city.
   A steady stream of voters moved through the modest, two-story
brick building at Saturday, when an almost celebratory air pervaded
the activity around voting booths.
   ``I just think it's great,'' Slawek Kosycarz, a 28-year-old
manager of an office supply company in suburban Niles, said after
casting his ballot. ``My vote was for Walesa. He's the one who
brought the whole thing down.''
   Danuta Stelmaszok, 37, a visitor from Dzierzoniow, Poland, and a
friend, Edward Figarski, 37, a steel press operator in Chicago,
took photographs of each other after voting.
   ``To show to family in Poland,'' said Ms. Stelmaszok, a divorcee
whose parents and children remain there.
   A runoff will be necessary if no candidate gets 50 percent of
the vote, a virtual certainty, said Elisabeth Slosarski, a member
of the specially appointed Election Commission which is handling
the election in the Chicago consular district.
   The commission is overseeing balloting at six sites in 26 states
it covers - the three Chicago sites, Milwaukee, Detroit and Los
Angeles. All voters must go to a designated site; no voting is
permitted by mail, said consul spokesman Robert Michniewicz.
   In Michigan, about 1,050 Poles voted, said Jamusz Wrobel of the
American Polish Congress in Hamtramck, a Detroit enclave that was
the state site for casting absentee ballots.
   Stanlay Madeja, who was running the voting in Manhattan, said
that by 1 p.m. EST, more than 1,000 Polish citizens had voted in
New York City.
   Polling places were also open in Boston; Buffalo, N.Y.; and
Passaic, N.J.
   Jaroszynski said all ballots would be counted by hand and
results sent from each of the consular districts to Warsaw.

<HEAD>Political Leader Says Cartel Chief Would Surrender Under Plan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The leader of the Medellin cocaine
cartel is among hundreds of drug traffickers who have offered to
surrender in exchange for special judicial treatment, a Colombian
politician said Saturday.
   Cartel chief Pablo Escobar ``is absolutely interested in
surrendering,'' said Diego Montana Cuellar, the former leader of
the leftist Patriotic Union Party.
   Montana is one of four Colombian political leaders, including
two former presidents, who last week delivered a cartel peace offer
to the government.
   As many as 300 Medellin cartel members would be willing to enter
a high-security compound guarded by either the army or
international human rights groups, the message said.
   The peace offer did not specifically mention Escobar, accused of
masterminding several assassinations and terrorist bombings since
Colombian officials began a crackdown on drug cartels last year.
   Escobar was indicted by a federal grand jury in February in
Tampa, Fla., on trafficking charges. He was also named in the 1988
indictment in Miami which included former Panamanian leader Manuel
Noriega.
   Several major cartel figures have been extradited to the United
States.
   Montana said the cartel leaders want to be judged collectively
and avoid individual trials. The cartel letter also demanded the
government protect surrendering traffickers from Colombian
assassins, and the government should not make the traffickers
confess.
   President Cesar Gaviria had already offered surrendering drug
suspects trial in Colombia rather than extradition, and promised
reduced prison sentences for traffickers who confess and become
informants.
   Montana said Gaviria received the cartel's letter with the
promise he would study it and respond to all of the proposals.
   ``I think the president will give the cartel a positive response
within the next few days,'' Montana said.
   But some political analysts say the demands may be hard for the
administration to accept. Many suspects are accused of trafficking
aboard, but have no charges against them in Colombia.
   If they are not extradited, they could walk free, according to
judicial experts.
   Government officials have also repeated they will not negotiate
with the cartel, named after the city where its operations are
based.
   Also, Montana said be believed Escobar in the next few days
would release nine journalists held hostage by the cartel.
   ``Escobar ordered the kidnappings of the journalists to use them
as a shield from authorities,'' Montana said. ``Now that he is
planning to turn himself in, he no longer needs the hostages.''

   A bus speeding to reach a railway

local newspapers reported.
   At least 16 bus passengers were injured, and no one on the train

   Police said some passengers were saved by a group of doctors
traveling on the train in Chaiyapum province, about 170 miles
northeast of Bangkok, the Nation newspaper reported Sunday.
   The reports say the bus driver stepped on the accelerator to try

   President Bush, relaxing at Camp David after
returning from the Middle East and Europe, says he's confident the
United Nations will approve using force to drive Iraq from Kuwait
and perhaps a deadline for taking action.
   ``The world is getting tired of this,'' Bush said Friday of
Iraq's nearly four-month-old occupation of Kuwait.
   Bush arrived home early today from the Middle East after
stopping in Geneva for three hours of talks with Syrian President
Hafez Assad. The White House said the two leaders agreed that Iraq
``should receive no reward for its aggression'' and that there
should be no `partial solutions'' to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Assad sidestepped a question of whether Syrian forces would
fight alongside Americans in an offensive operation.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and Assad held
``an extended conversation on the question of terrorism.'' Syria,
on the State Department's list of nations that sponsor terrorism,
is suspected of having links to acts including the bombings of Pan
Am Flight 103 in 1988 and the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut in
1983.

   LONDON (AP) - Even as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
supporters claim she was undermined by her own party, a poll
indicates any of the three main candidates for her job will bring
an election victory for the troubled Conservatives.
   The Harris poll of 1,107 voters around the country is the latest
survey to predict a sharp upturn in Conservative Party fortunes
under a new prime minister.
   Under Mrs. Thatcher the Conservatives trailed Labor, the main
opposition party in the House of Commons, for the past 16 months in
opinion polls.
   The poll was conducted on Thursday after Mrs. Thatcher announced
she would resign.

   Swarms of shoppers are descending on the nation's malls and

cashbox may not be loud enough to spread cheer among shopkeepers.
   ``I am going to spend less this year because the economy is bad
and money is tight,'' shopper Joyce Sylvia of Providence, R.I.,
said Friday.
   A worsening national recession and the Persian Gulf crisis may
lead to the worst holiday sales in years. Many people say their

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Supporters of the proposed Two Forks Dam in
Colorado say they may go to court to challenge a decision by
federal environmental officials to kill the project.
   If the veto of the dam by the Environmental Protection Agency is
sustained, it could set a precedent for similar projects, they
said.
   William H. Van Schooneveld, chairman of the Metropolitan Water
Providers that sponsored the Colorado dam, said, ``This decision
affects not just Denver, but it may be the end of all big water
projects. If EPA can veto this, there really isn't any project that
anybody can develop that can pass the EPA.''
   ``There are a lot of grounds for (a federal court) appeal,'' he
said.
   EPA announced the veto of the dam Friday night, confirming
earlier unofficial reports. The dam would have been the largest
non-federal water project in the West. It had been supported by
Reagan administration officials.

   'Tis the season for mail-order giving, and more of the gifts
crisscrossing the nation make for a transportable feast.
   Fruit in the mail is nothing new, but how about six pints of
assorted gelato packed in dry ice? It's yours, if someone doesn't
mind paying $10 a pint to get it to you.
   And forget the mundane fruitcake. Select instead a bouquet of
porcini mushrooms, a pair of smoked quail or a basket of prickly
pears.
   The 3,600 companies that tempt the palate with mail-order
edibles are competing for the $1.2 billion that Americans are
expected to spend on food orders this year, according to a recent
study by the New York market research firm FIND-SVP.
   Growing at an annual rate of about 10 percent, mail-order foods
are likely to account for more than $3 billion in sales by the year
2000, FIND-SVP said.
   Business whips into a frenzy during the final quarter, with some
mail-order companies doing virtually all their shipping between
September and January. Entire 747 jets have been stuffed with
nothing but thousands of pounds of holiday pears from Harry and
David.
   Harry and David, a Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical division based in
Medford, Ore., is among the nation's largest mail-order food
companies.
   According to FIND-SVP, the top 10 food-by-mail companies control
45 percent of the market; about 3,000 companies are characterized
as ``mom-and-pop'' operations, each with sales of less than $50,000
a year.
   Though the vast majority of food moves by ground transportation,
most of the industry's growth is in overnight and two-day delivery
services, which can guarantee a delicate or perishable item arrives
intact.
   Clambake Celebrations of Cape Cod, Mass., for example, can
promise a customer in Albuquerque, N.M., that she will have
lobster, mussels and a few ears of corn - all packed in authentic
seaweed - steaming on the stove less than 48 hours after phoning in
the order. The cost: $119.95 for two.
   San Francisco's Gelato Classico Italian Ice Cream is just
begining to offer its products by mail. Six pints - which comprise
a minimum order at $59.95 - are packaged in dry ice in a foam
container much like a picnic cooler.
   Consultant Jay Walker, who heads Ridgefield, Conn.-based Catalog
Media Corp., said that though food-by-mail has been big business
for a long time, ``overnight delivery ... allowed a freshness
perception for millions of people who didn't believe they could get
(food) fresh in the mail. And it made sure food can be given as a
gift reliably.''
   If you ask Federal Express, spokesman Brandon Davis will tell
you his company has been a major boost to the food industry.
   ``Our business ... allows them to extend their business season
right up to Dec. 21,'' he said. ``If you do 80 percent of your
business in one or two months of the year and can extend that
selling season by just two weeks, it's a tremendous boost.''
   Companies with very narrow product lines can stay in business
because they cater to a national - rather than local - clientele.
Franklin Foods of North Franklin, Conn., for example, sells only
exotic mushrooms like Polish cepes, shiitakes and porcinis.
Smithfield, Va.-based Fin 'N Feather will put a smoked pheasant
buffet on your table.
   Mr. Spear Inc. of Stockton, Calif., has cultivated a list of
25,000 fans of its colossal asparagus, its sole product. ``It's an
alternative to flowers,'' said president Chip Arnett.
   His super-premium asparagus, which has been served at the White
House, simply is ``not in sufficient enough quantities to make it
available from a retail standpoint,'' he said.
   Consultant Walker believes the food-by-mail business is
``countercyclical'' to the economy - that is, as the recession
deepens, business is likely to increase.
   Consumers who feel pinched for cash typically ``trade down''
when it comes to buying gifts, and food is a popular alternative
because it has ``no comparative market price,'' Walker said. ``You
don't know if a dozen apples from an orchard in Oregon is a $20
gift or a $40 gift,'' he said.
   Perusing catalogs in the coziness of one's own home and ordering
with the mere push of telephone buttons has become a recreational
pastime of sorts for many Americans.
   ``People are sitting home and they're bored and so they pick up
the phone and buy on a credit card,'' said Debbie Cohen, a national
saleswoman for Melissa's World Variety Produce Inc., a Los Angeles
company that specializes in shipping in exotic produce like purple
potatoes, elephant garlic and prickly pears.
   Though consumers who buy foods through the mail make up less
than 2 percent of the population, they are an affluent lot willing
to pay more for convenience and a guarantee of quality.
   A pint of Gelato Classico costs just $3.95 in one of the
company's 32 shops, but the minimum 6-pit mail order commands a
$36 shipping charge. Too extravagant to buy for yourself, perhaps,
but an exquisite gift to give.
   The mail-order business does have its limitations.
   Identifying customers can be costly, and it is difficult to
adapt quickly to changes in consumer taste. A company that must put
together its Christmas catalog by August can't suddenly decide to
replace its pecan pie if cranberries become the rage.
   In addition, the threat of higher postal rates always looms
large. Third-class postage, the rate for most catalogs, has
increased more than 350 percent since 1970, and the U.S. Postal
Service is planning another rate hike for February.
   Mail-order companies are being pressed to collect sales taxes on
a higher proportion of their sales, forcing them to compete harder
against local retailers.
   Finally, since the food business is seasonal, some companies
actually are forced to shut down during spring and summer. Others
try to round out their offerings with other products. Harry and
David, for example, has a sister company called Jackson and
Perkins, a gardening and flower concern, which helps smooth out
sales throughout the year.
   To further entice customers, many companies have a
``thing-of-the-month'' plan. For $219.95, Harry and David will send
a box of fruit once a month; for $720, Gelato will send six pints
of its super-premium ice cream 12 times a year, and you get to
choose among flavors like fresh ginger, double espresso and Coppa
Mista, with swirls of chocolate, vanilla, pistachio and almond ice
creams.
   Among other ``special'' services companies provide, Baskets of
Elegance, a California fashioner of gourmet food baskets, sends
customers a color photograph of their orders before they're
shipped.
