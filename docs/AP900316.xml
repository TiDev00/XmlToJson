<HEAD>Woman Sheds 710 Pounds Through Surgery, Diet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who has dropped 710 pounds in
three years is still losing weight through a combination of
surgery, diet and exercise.
   ``I am happy now. Alive, that's how I feel,'' said Rosemarie
Carnemolla, who has slimmed down to 250 pounds.
   Carnemolla, who lives in Union Vale about 50 miles north of New
York City, had surgery in 1987 to reduce the size of her stomach.
After 18 months on a liquid diet, she began a diet of three meals a
day with a lot of fruit, vegetables and fish.
   Since her surgery, the 5-foot-4-inch Carnemolla has seen her
115-inch waist shrink to 44 inches. Her feet, once a size 12EEE,
are now a size seven.
   ``I can buy clothes right off the rack. They're big, but it's
still something. I can go out, work, take a walk,'' said
Carnemolla, who had been a binge eater since childhood.
   Her weight will drop by 25 pounds next month when doctors
operate again to cut off excess skin, she said.
   Meanwhile, through diet and exercise, her weight continues to
drop. Carnemolla's goal is to get down to 140 pounds.
   She swims, bowls, walks and goes to Weight Watchers every week.
Inspiration has come from diet expert Richard Simmons. Carnemolla
and Simmons talk on the telephone several times a week and they
have appeared on TV shows together.
   Carnemolla said the more weight she drops, the harder it gets to
lose more.
   ``Last week, I only lost a pound and a half,'' she said.
``That's all right. It's a pound and a half less than the week
before.''

   No green-tinted swine will lead Paddy's
parade, because of objections that pig lovers made.
   Plans were all set for St. Patrick's big deal until animal
activists started to squeal.
   A full-blooded Irishman _ a sight to be seen! _ planned to
carry, dear Colleen, a pig dyed bright green.
   But Grand Marshal James Monahan, who will lead the parade, got
grief for the ham-handed plans he had laid.
   The humane society had 30 complaints: Dyed pigs are no tribute
to dead Irish saints.
   The porker might suffer emotional shock if paraded by Monahan
block after block.
   So Monahan said he'd instead buy a stuffed one _ perhaps a toy
pig will be almost as much fun.

   Next time, how about a little coffee with
the Cremora.
   State health officials were called in last weekend when a white
powder coated cars and homes in this northern South Carolina
community. But officials from the Department of Health and
Environmental Control said there was nothing to worry about.
   ``It's just Cremora,'' said Joe Faris Jr.
   Borden Inc. manufactures powdered coffee creamer, and
occasionally, air vent driers inside the plant become clogged,
sending clouds of Cremora drifting through the vents on the
company's roof.
   Faris said Borden's occasional accidents cause ``aesthetic''
problems.
   But to the people who live and work near the plant, the white
powder is a source of aggravation.
   The coffee creamer mixes with dirt and pollen and settles in a
grimy layer over siding and windows, residents complain. When
moistened by morning dew, it hardens like concrete on car windows.
   Grace Dover, whose home is just a few yards from Borden's back
door, said she has stood on her back porch and watched the creamer
``fall just like snowflakes.''
   On Saturday, she said, the ``stacks out yonder were belching
like a volcano.''
   Borden's plant manager, Don Seltz, did not return telephone
calls seeking comment.

   With hooker styles at Angelo Tarlazzi and wild
lampshade hoop skirts at Thierry Mugler, some fashion shows failed
to resemble their purpose _ ready-to-wear.
   But with all the craziness in Thursday's shows for next winter,
there existed quiet and sporty moments at houses like Cerruti,
Castelbajac and even Comme des Garcons.
   Japanese Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons concentrated on
drawstring-parka looks and bubbly silhouettes. Coupled with minis
or long skirts, the bunchy parkas or anoraks were often in black,
white or lame, with the drawstrings all over the place.
   Kawakubo's new discovery was ``bonded'' or unwoven fabrics with
a light, shimmery quality, sometimes crimped, or in gray with a
mosaic or snakeskin quality.
   They looked appealing in shades of brown, gold or caramel or
spring colors like robin's-egg blue. And some iridescent velvety
fabrics were striking for dressier moments.
   Shapeless tunics, dangling extra sleeves and bunching in odd
places were the usual Kawakubo trademarks that appeal to her many
fans in Japan.
   Yohji Yamamoto went in for red and black in a big way and
offered fun if somewhat complicated styles in bicolored outfits
with petal-like skirts under cute fake fur wraps.
   He also used curvy bell shapes to advantage in longer-skirted
models, with quilted skirts and sleeves paired with fitted bodices.
The bubbly skirts and tops gave it all a ``modern-medieval'' look.
   In sexier ready-to-wear, Angelo Tarlazzi showed a lot of
provocative skin-tight knit minis in hot colors or navy, some with
draping and buttons at the skirt with hems way up to high thigh.
   Topped with loose little jackets and worn with long satin
shirts, these looked reasonably wearable by the younger set.
   His late-day clothes in stretch satins and crepes featuring
quilted satin hearts on derrieres and busts and his draped sizzling
satin body-hugging numbers were tarty in an echo of what Ungaro did
several seasons ago. They looked zingy on the runway but couldn't
be safely worn by polite society.
   Jean-Charles de Castelbajac had some great ideas in the sporty
line, starting with his huge mohair tartan overcoats topping tiny
bright minis and tights all in his preferred primary colors.
   Bright new mohair and ribbon-woven fabrics mixed with quilted
leather made for interesting jackets topping leather shorts with
colorful tights.
   A witty feature was the rolled window-blind panels on coats worn
over shortie kilts. There were rafts of duffel coats, full shorts
bunched at the waist and some striking burnoose coats with hoods.
   Unforgettable were the vast trapeze coats in plaid on the
outside and white fake fur linings turned out to make cape collars.
   ``This special double-faced plaid fabric especially made in
southwest France is basically what the old French concierges'
bedroom slippers are made of,'' said Castelbajac.
   Nino Cerruti kept his show relatively quiet with soft and loose
hooded duster coats over narrow jersey pants, and some good dark
windowpane plaids _ in blazers over lean draped asymmetrical skirts
or jumpsuits with full pants.
   In the late-day line he stuck to things like pants in shades of
bronze Lurex split up and flapping to show the whole leg, and a
raft of sexy black ``tuxedo'' outfits, some with shorts, others
with long skirts and backless.
   Thierry Mugler ended the day with several shows so crowded with
waiting journalists and buyers there were near-riots. His main
theme as usual was slightly kinky sex.
   This time he flaunted it with lots of black vinyl tight pants or
tiny minis with flared hems and neon colors in late-day dresses.
The ``ball gowns'' had lampshade hoop skirts, cut very high up
front.
   Aside from some beautifully fitted long jackets and ankle-length
coats with full skirts, there wasn't much to wear on the street.
   One spectactor remarked, ``Those hoops would be hard to fit into
a taxi.''

   Kidnappers holding three Americans
threatened to kill them if the U.S. government did not meet
unspecified demands. What follows are excerpts from the statement
Thursday by the group that calls itself Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine.
   The handwritten statement in Arabic, translated by The
Associated Press, said:
   ``The Organization of Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine denounces media reports about humanitarian moves to free
the hostages and close this case.
   ``It asks the authors of these moves not to interfere in this
matter because we are holding agents and spies against our people
and they will be executed if the American administration fails to
meet our demands. ...
   ``We did not carry out the death sentences because we are
waiting for the appropriate time. ...
   ``We have laid down the trap and are eagerly waiting for the
promised American adventure to free them (hostages) by force.
   ``We announce that there is no solution for and no deal about
this issue except within the framework of exchanges.
   ``Humanitarian efforts should move in the correct, useful and
meaningful directions. ...
   ``Our people shall not stand handcuffed in front of this
conspiracy. We shall not at all suffice ourselves by watching but
shall begin taking the adequate measures to prevent the arrival of
the Soviets. ...
   ``All airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines,
their jetliners and offices, will be direct targets for us. This is
a warning and a threat.''

<HEAD>March 17 is Just Another Day in `Irish County' USA</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   March 17 is just another day in Lafayette County, Fla., the
nation's most Irish county.
   The county seat is named Mayo, but there will be no St.
Patrick's Day parade, no green line painted down Main Street, no
green beer at the Hideaway Tavern, no St. Pat's Day cards at West's
Drugs, no corned beef and cabbage at the Mayo Cafe.
   No shamrocks, not even a leprechaun. Faith n' begorra, y'all!
   A few folks will wear the green, but only because ``they heard
about it on television,'' according to Emmett Howell, a local
historian.
   Residents, in fact, were surprised to learn that in the last
U.S. census 17.7 percent of Lafayette's 4,035 residents declared
Irish ancestry, the highest percentage of any county in the United
States.
   They weren't the only ones.
   ``I was shocked, until I found out what happened there,'' said
James Allen, a California State University professor who spent
seven years studying the census data.
   In their eight-pound demographic atlas, ``We the People,'' Allen
and fellow geographer Eugene Turner explain that Lafayette's Irish
descend not from Roman Catholics who left Ireland after the famine
in the middle of the 19th century, but from Protestants who
migrated from northern Ireland years earlier.
   These immigrants traced their own roots back to Scotland, which
their ancestors left in the 1600s to colonize northeastern Ireland.
But many moved on to America, where they led the first wave of
trans-Appalachian settlement.
   Most of the counties with the highest percentage of Irish
ancestry in the 1980 census were in rural and small-town sections
of the Southeast, the area where the Scotch-Irish settled and which
now has more than a third of the American Irish.
   Smith, Miss., is the nation's third most Irish county, and
Houston, Tenn. its fifth. Numbers two and four are Norfolk and
Suffolk counties in and around Boston, whose Irish are typically
Catholic and more likely to have descended from post-famine
immigrants.
   The Scotch-Irish, whose descendants account for about half of
the 40 million Americans of Irish descent, ``have retained a sense,
albeit a weak one, of an Irish heritage,'' according to Allen.
   Mayo shares its name with the famously bleak county in western
Ireland, but the town actually was named after a Confederate
officer. With only two traffic lights _ one a mere blinking caution
signal _ and a population around 1,000, Mayo would be hard pressed
to celebrate St. Pat's Day in style, even if it wanted to.
   Which it doesn't.
   At West Drugs, Harriet West said she used to stock St. Patrick's
Day cards, but it wasn't worth her while. ``Didn't sell more'n one
or two,' she explained this week.
   At the Mayo Cafe, Thelma Driver said there would be no corned
beef and cabbage on the menu because St. Pat's ``is not a real big
deal here.''
   Asked if she knew anyone who was Irish, she said, ``No one's
said they were Irish.'' She paused and added: ``My husband's part
Irish.''
   If there was any real Irish spirit in town, surely it would be
found at an establishment called the Hideaway Tavern run by a man
named Sullivan.
   ``Is WHAT a big day?'' Lewin Sullivan asked during a telephone
interview.
   St. Patrick's Day.
   ``Not particularly,'' he said, drawing the word out in his
panhandle drawl. ``Most of 'em don't ever think of it.''
   Well, you're Irish, right?
   ``I figure I must be, from the name, but how much, I don't
know.''
   It seemed there could be no less Irish place than the most Irish
county in America ... other than one of the least Irish counties in
America.
   In Morgan County, Utah, only about 32 of 4,917 residents claimed
Irish ancestry 10 years ago. People there, mostly Mormons of
English descent, are as unexcited about St. Patrick's Day as
Lafayette residents.
   ``I've never heard anyone boast of being Irish,'' said Linda
Smith, secretary of the county historical society. ``It just isn't
discussed.''
   Morgan City, a community of 2,000 just northeast of Salt Lake
City, is as bleak as Mayo: no green line down Commercial Street, no
corned beef at the Spring Chicken Inn. Jeff London, chairman of the
Board of Commissioners, flipped through the telephone book looking
for Irish surnames, and came up only with an O'Driscoll.
   Exiled children of Erin, however, can take heart: On Saturday
the Country Cafe will have green beer on tap and Irish decorations,
``like four-leaf clovers,'' said manager Beverly Dahlquist.
   Sure you're a fine colleen, Beverly, but a shamrock has three
leaves.

   Angry Irish-American groups are calling for a
withholdin' of the green _ cash, that is _ from a Chicago-based
card company they accuse of printing offensive St. Patrick's Day
cards.
   Several organizations and individuals want a boycott of Recycled
Paper Products, whose March 17 offerings included cards that show a
drunkard inside a bottle marked ``Irish Whiskey,'' and a naked
woman with a shamrock across her buttocks.
   ``I'm all for the First Amendment, but this stuff goes way over
the top,'' said Niall O'Dowd, publisher of the weekly newspaper
Irish Voice. ``I don't mind some of the things _ they're done in
reasonable fun _ but this ...''
   The newspaper encouraged its readers to call or write in protest
to Recycled. An Irish radio personality, the Ancient Order of
Hibernians and other Irish groups called for a boycott of the
company and stores selling the cards.
   The company said it was aware of the complaints and might remove
some of the cards before next year, but such talk failed to appease
angry Irish-Americans.
   ``I was totally revolted, just revolted beyond belief,'' after
seeing some of the cards, said Adrian Flannelly, whose radio show
claims 1.2 million New York City-area listeners each weekend.
   While greeting cards may seem like a small thing, the money they
make could raise Irish eyebrows. St. Patrick's Day is the ninth
most popular holiday for exchanging cards and the industry
estimates that 20 million go back and forth.
   Recycled is well aware of this; executive secretary Karen
Thompson says her company is just catering to the marketplace. ``We
have different types because people want different types. ... At no
time did we want to offend anybody or pick on any groups.''
   But such talk didn't calm Nick Murphy, one of 250,000 members of
the Ancient Order of Hibernians.
   ``On St. Patrick's Day, we're all supposed to be drunk, and
that's all we do,'' said Murphy, past president of the Hibernians.
``A lot of people look upon St. Patrick's Day as a religious
holiday.''
   It's not the first time the company has been attacked for its
St. Patrick's Day cards. Last year, the National Ethnic Coalition
of Organizations awarded Recycled Paper Products a ``Golden Pit''
award for a card illustrated with a vomiting bishop.
   That card has since been discontinued, said Ms. Thompson. The
Irish groups hope the same happens to the rest of the offending
cards.
   ``We'll definitely be using the airwaves to make sure nobody
buys anything from these people,'' said Flannelly.

   The emergence of neo-Nazi
groups and black leader Nelson Mandela's embrace of Yasser Arafat
have frightened South Africa's Jews, who fear the country may be
facing a wave of anti-Semitism.
   South African Jewish leaders are concerned South Africa's tense
political situation is giving neo-Nazi and other anti-Semitic
groups more opportunity to operate and increase their support.
   The South African government has expressed concern over a recent
rash of incidents.
   ``These extremist acts of desecration have no place in a
civilized society,'' Foreign Minister Pik Botha said in a statement.
   Swastika flags and anti-Jewish slogans have become prominent at
extreme right-wing rallies. An Israeli flag was burned at a
right-wing meeting in Pretoria in February and vandals left a
severed pig head and a swastika on a synagogue door in Johannesburg
in March.
   Members of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement wear khaki
uniforms and insignia reminiscent of the stormtroopers of Nazi
Germany. Anti-Semitic slogans and placards are becoming more common
at the group's meetings.
   South Africa's Jewish community also was shocked when Mandela
embraced Palestine Liberation Organization leader Arafat in Zambia.
Mandela said his African National Congress and the PLO were allied
``freedom fighters.''
   Told his action had worried South African Jews, Mandela said it
was ``too bad,'' according to local press reports.
   Gerald Leissner, chairman of the South African Jewish Board of
Deputies, said the anti-Semitic incidents were worrying. ``We would
like to live in a society in which there is no racial hatred.
Unfortunately, it seems these incidents are becoming more
frequent,'' he said.
   The right wing has been gaining strength in South Africa because
of fears among some whites over the government's plan to end
white-minority rule and share political power with blacks.
   While the main right-wing parties publicly denounce
anti-Semitism, some of their supporters have openly paraded with
swastika flags. More extreme rightist groups are attracting support
and neo-Nazi groups are starting to operate in the open, according
to Jewish leaders.
   Aleck Goldberg, national executive director of the South African
Jewish Board of Deputies, the main Jewish leadership, said the wave
of anti-Semitic incidents had frightened many South African Jews.
   ``The Nazis are crawling out of the woodwork,'' he said in an
interview. ``Up until now they've been underground. They haven't
come forward in the past.''
   Goldberg said Nazi groups were claiming that Jews are part of a
racial conspiracy to end white-minority rule. Jews were being
singled out because many are prominent liberals who have fought
against apartheid, he said.
   The Nazi groups appear small with no more than a few hundred
supporters, but Jewish leaders want the government to take action
to ensure they do not become a serious threat.
   ``We would hope because of the inflamatory nature of what
they're doing that the authorities will take strong action against
them,'' Goldberg said.
   The Jewish community also was worried about that black
nationalist groups might be anti-Semitic. Jewish leaders did not
see Mandela as anti-Semitic, but were worried about the ANC's ties
with the PLO, Goldberg said.
   ``There is concern because Arafat is regarded as a menace,'' he
said.
   South Africa and Israel had close ties for many years because of
the international isolation both nations faced. Israel has cut
support for South Africa in recent years, including economic and
weapons assistance, because of U.S. pressure to isolate Pretoria
because of its white-minority rule.
   South Africa's Jewish community still had close ties with Israel
and wanted South Africa to remain a friend of Israel whatever the
ideological complexion of any future government, Goldberg said.

<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is about
to venture into his first round of on-site African diplomacy, a
task that draws less attention than the Arab-Israeli dispute in the
Middle East but can be as complicated.
   After a 25-hour flight, Baker's aging U.S. Air Force jet will
land Monday in Namibia, the newly independent former South African
colony, and he and other world figures will attend ceremonies for
the new nation.
   That's the easy part. The United States, during the Reagan
administration, played a leading role in the establishment of
Namibia and is prepared to provide $7.8 million in aid next year to
help the new country get on its feet.
   As the U.S. representative, Baker can take pride in his
country's help in ending a long and difficult guerrilla war.
   But once the ceremonies are over, Baker may feel as if he is
still trying to bring Israelis and Palestinians together.
   That effort went into suspension this week amid an Israeli
government crisis over Baker's formula for negotiations. It could
be months before the United States resumes its mediator role.
   In Africa, though, Baker will be instantly hip-deep in the
struggle over apartheid. He has invited black activist Nelson
Mandela to meet with him in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. And he
has made arrangements for talks in Cape Town with President F. W.
de Klerk of South Africa as well as black opponents of racial
separation.
   Mandela, who was freed by de Klerk last month after spending 27
years in prison, is demanding that the Bush administration cut its
diplomatic ties to South Africa and stiffen economic sanctions.
   But State Department policymakers would rather keep the current
sanctions and use relations with Pretoria, such as Baker's
five-hour visit to Cape Town next Thursday, as leverage to steer de
Klerk into accelerating change.
   De Klerk's freeing of Mandela from prison and the legalization
of the African National Congress were viewed as positive, even
courageous steps by the Bush administration. But a 3{-year state of
emergency still exists and there are up to 300 political prisoners
whose release is a prerequisite to lifting U.S. sanctions.
   President Bush, in the euphoria over Mandela's release, invited
de Klerk to the White House. But Baker is likely to do a diplomatic
soft-shoe away from the subject. He is under pressure from American
critics of apartheid to hold out for the dismantling of racial
segregation first.
   Randall Robinson, executive director of the black lobbying group
TransAfrica, says ``the Oval Office carries with it a special
meaning,'' and that de Klerk has not earned that recognition.
   So Baker will be walking a tightrope as he tries to nudge South
Africa toward more reform.
   Baker also may try some mediation between rival parties in
Angola.
   He has invited President Jose Eduardo dos Santos to see him in
Windhoek and Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the U.S.-backed UNITA
rebel movement, in Zaire at the end of the week.
   The United States has no relations with the Angolan government
and provides an estimated $45 million to $50 million a year in
covert aid to Savimbi's guerrillas.
   The 14-year war settled into a stalemate after government forces
captured part of Mavinga, a Savimbi stronghold in southeast Angola,
in late December.
   Diplomacy sometimes operates most effectively in a stalemate. A
negotiated settlement appears more attractive when neither side can
gain the upper hand.
   Savimbi has ties to South Africa and is a favorite of
conservative members of Congress. Dos Santos has the support of
Cuban troops, but about half of the 50,000 who were in the country
have withdrawn under the agreement that produced independence for
Namibia. The rest are supposed to leave by next year.
   The United States is alone among major Western countries in not
recognizing the Angolan government. Despite ties to the Soviet
Union and Cuba and its Marxist trappings, the country is developing
a private economy and exports about 75 percent of its oil to the
United States through two American oil companies, Chevron and
Conoco.
   Last year, Dos Santos accepted an invitation from 36 members of
Congress to visit the United States. But he wanted to be received
as a head of state, which is impossible because of the lack of
U.S.-Angolan diplomatic relations.
   So Baker will have to try some fancy footwork on Angola, too,
while looking for openings to promote a peaceful solution.

   Federal officials say they've been unable to
figure out how to seize Khun Sa, the admitted opium warlord of
Burma now facing federal drug-trafficking charges.
   A 10-count indictment returned in December against Khun Sa was
unsealed Thursday as Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced the
charges.
   The charges stem from the largest heroin seizure in history _
1,086 kilograms seized in February 1988 in Bangkok, Thailand,
before they were to be shipped to New York.
   Khun Sa is ``probably the largest heroin producer in the
world,'' said Ed Heath, who until recently headed the Drug
Enforcement Administration's heroin desk.
   The Burmese government has been unable to apprehend Khun Sa
after years of fighting his private army.
   Khun Sa also is charged with importing or attempting to import
more than 3,500 pounds of heroin into New York between September
1986 and February 1988, according to the indictment returned in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y.
   The indictment was kept sealed for several months while the DEA
``explored every option that we could to determine if it was
feasible to apprehend Khun Sa,'' DEA spokesman Frank Shults said
Thursday.
   ``We thought that by watching his travel, it might be possible
to apprehend him in another country,'' Shults said. ``We explored
all those other possibilities, and it was determined that that was
not a feasible approach, so the indictment was unsealed now.''
   The indictment was revealed just weeks after the State
Department announced a substantial increase in worldwide production
of opium, from which heroin is derived.
   The worldwide total, the department said, was 4,209 metric tons
last year, up from 2,433 to 3,308 tons in 1988. In Burma alone,
opium production increased to 2,625 tons last year, up from 770 to
1,100 tons in 1988.
   DEA Administrator Jack Lawn said the current U.S. consumption of
heroin is just over 5 metric tons a year. It takes 10 tons of opium
to make 1 ton of heroin.
   Lawn estimated that up to 45 percent of the heroin consumed in
the United States comes from the Burmese section of the Golden
Triangle _ an area of Southeast Asia where Thailand, Burma and Laos
meet. Khun Sa is reputed to control as much as 90 percent of the
heroin from Burma.
   The DEA believes Khun Sa has been targeting Americans as
customers of his drug business for decades, Lawn said.
   ``We believe that Khun Sa was predominantly responsible for the
flow of heroin to our military forces in Vietnam and in Thailand
during R&amp;R (rest and relaxation) as a means of retaliating against
the U.S. forces for the damages they wrought during the war
itself,'' Lawn said.
   Thornburgh denounced Khun Sa as the ``Prince of Death'' and
sought to play down the difficulties of bringing him to trial in
the United States.
   Khun Sa leads the private Shan United Army, a force estimated at
4,000 to 16,000 guerrillas who have been battling the Burmese
government since 1958, when it broke a promise to allow the Shan
state to secede.
   U.S.-Burmese relations have been strained since U.S. aid was cut
off two years ago following several massacres and the installation
of a military government.
   But Thornburgh said the two governments were united in their
desire to apprehend Khun Sa and added, ``He may be subject to
delivery by his own forces, if someone decides to betray him.''
   Khun Sa has offered repeatedly to abandon the drug trade if the
United States would pay him millions of dollars a year for six to
eight years to buy out the opium crops. Such an annual fee has been
reported recently as ranging from $100 million to $300 million.
   The U.S. government has rejected such offers.
   ``The last thing to do is to pay the extortionist,'' Lawn said.

   A ram's horn sounded and a cantor's
melancholy psalms went out from the mound where, 800 years ago
today, the Jews of York committed mass suicide to escape an
anti-Semitic mob.
   It is sometimes called ``The English Masada,'' this most
infamous incident of Jew-hatred in British history.
   Like the Jews who killed themselves on the desert fortress of
Masada rather than fall slaves to Rome, the memory of York Jewry's
fate has survived through the ages, still strong enough eight
centuries later to draw several hundred Jews and a handful of
Christians to a memorial service Thursday at the place where it
happened.
   The service opened a four-day program of lectures, concerts and
exhibitions organized by Jewish and Christian groups and the city
of York to commemorate the slaughter of March 16, 1190.
   No one knows exactly how many died, but historians reckon the
death toll was about 150.
   The story was told in compelling detail by William of Newburgh,
a contemporary historian who lived near the northeast England city.
   Anti-Jewish feeling grew in England with the religious fervor of
the Crusades, the attempt by European Christians to win control of
the Holy Land from the Moslems. By March 1190, York was close to
exploding.
   Egged on by the local noblemen who thought they could clear
their debts to Jewish moneylenders by killing them, a mob set out
to hunt down the Jews.
   The Jews fled to a castle, where they were entitled to royal
protection. The mob surrounded the fortress. The constable went out
of the castle, perhaps to reason with the crowd. When he returned,
the frightened Jews would not let him back in. He called in the
sheriff, who ordered the door broken down.
   The mob read this to mean royal assent to a pogrom, while the
Jews assumed all hope was lost.
   Rabbi Yomtob of Joigny turned to his people and, according to
William's account, told them: ``We ought to prefer a glorious death
to an infamous life ... for if we should fall into the hands of the
enemy, we should die according to their pleasure, and amidst their
mockery. Therefore, let us willingly and devoutly, with our own
hands, render up to Him that life which the Creator gave to us...''
   First to act was a man named Josce, who killed his wife and
children. Yomtob then killed him. Then each head of family killed
his loved ones, and was in turn killed by Yomtob. Yomtob died last.
Those who chose not to die accepted the mob's offer of life if they
accepted baptism. But when they came out, they too were killed.
   Finally, the mob broke into York Minster, where the documents of
their debts were kept, and burned the papers in the vestry.
   Although the monarch of the time, King Richard the Lion-Heart,
was furious and sent a senior official to mete out punishment, the
perpetrators were never caught. And although Jews continued to live
in York, many came to believe it was an accursed city.
   That sentiment persists, as reflected in lines by the northern
English poet Jon Silkin: ``The event has the frigid persistence of
a growth in the flesh ... a gross tumor and a sense of such growth
haunting the flesh of York.''
   Today fewer than two dozen Jews live in York, and they are used
to the surprised reactions they get from other Jews.
   Ben Sugar, a retired economics lecturer who has lived in York
since the 1930s, says many Jews believe a rabbinical edict forbids
them to live here.
   ``It's a myth that has developed over the generations,'' he said
in an interview.
   After lunch at a York hotel and a lecture on the massacre, the
Jews walked through town to the bleak mound in the middle of a car
park and up a flight of steep stairs.
   They crowded into the circular stone Clifford's Tower, built
long after the massacre, to listen to services conducted by
Anglican Archbishop of York John Habgood and Rabbi Norman Solomon
from Birmingham.
   Psalms were read, the cantor sang the dirge ``El Malei
Rachamim'' (God full of Mercy), and the crowd recited ``Kaddish,''
the prayer for the dead.
   ``On this mound ... occurred one of the most atrocious events in
medieval history,'' said the Rev. Geoffrey Hunter, the Anglican
chairman of the commemoration committee.
   Hunter blamed it on mob violence, greedy noblemen, and ``the
church's tragic and sad record in not only countenancing
anti-Semitism, but so often indeed fostering it.''
   ``May perpetrators and victims come together in forgiveness and
in hope,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study: Loss of Amazon Rain Forest Would Change Regional Climate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Removing the tropical rain forest from the
Amazon River basin of South America would change forever the
climate of that region and could affect the global weather, a new
study says.
   Once the trees are felled, said Jagadish Shukla, a professor of
meteorology at the University of Maryland, the famed dense jungle
forest along the Amazon River will be gone forever.
   ``You will never be able to regenerate the forests once you have
cut them,'' said Shukla, the co-author of a study appearing today
in the journal Science.
   Shukla said wiping out the Amazon River forest probably also
would affect the worldwide climate because it would change the
temperature of waters near the mouth of the river and perhaps
disrupt weather patterns affected by those waters.
   The scientist said a computer model of the effects of
deforestation along the Amazon River shows that rainfall would
decline by more than 26 percent, the average area temperature would
rise and evaporated moisture in the Amazon basin atmosphere would
decline by 30 percent.
   Loss of the trees would not turn the area into a desert,
although Shukla noted in an interview, ``We were tempted to say
that, but we didn't go that far.''
   The Amazon basin gets about 97 inches of rainfall a year.
Killing the tropical forest, he said, would reduce the annual
rainfall by about 25 inches.
   Once this new, drier pattern is established, the loss of the
Amazon basin forest would be irreversible, Shukla said.
   Global climate also could be affected, he said.
   The Amazon River dumps huge amounts of fresh water into the
Atlantic Ocean, which affects the delicate distribution of heat in
the ocean and in the atmosphere.
   By reducing the amount of rainfall over the Amazon Basin, Shukla
said, the amount of water carried to the Atlantic also would be
reduced.
   ``There would be tremendous changes in the chemistry and ecology
of the oceans,'' he said. ``It is very likely that there will be
very significant global effects on the climate.''
   It is not known precisely how the world's weather might change,
however, he said.
   Shukla and two colleagues at Maryland's Center for
Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions created a computer program that
tests the effects of Amazon deforestation. The computer model
enables the scientists to make the complex calculations necessary
to predict what would happen if the Amazon's trees were gone.
   The Amazon rain forest is the largest forest in the world and is
being destroyed at what Shukla called ``a devastatingly fast rate.''
   About 14,000 square miles of forest are cleared annually and
about 12 percent of the forest already is gone. Most of the
clearing is by slash-and-burn farmers who replace the trees with
crops and pasture.
   ``If deforestation were to continue at this rate, most of the
Amazonian tropical forests would disappear in 50 to 100 years,''
Shukla wrote.
   He said clearing the forest affects the regional climate in
three ways: removing the trees causes sunlight to heat up the soil
surface; loss of the trees significantly lowers the rate at which
water is evaporated into the atmosphere; and loss of the trees
disrupts the wind patterns that carry moist air over South America
from the oceans.
   About half of the Amazon basin rainfall comes from water that
has evaporated from the vegetation of the forest. Once the forest
is gone, Shukla said, it would close off this source of water vapor
for the rain clouds.
   Shukla said there weren't enough weather records in the area to
determine if the climate has already been changed by the 12 percent
of the trees that have been removed. However, studies have shown
that soil temperatures increased in the cleared areas and that
forest fires are more intense in periods of reduced rainfall.
   ``What is the critical size beyond which the climate changes and
we can't recover the forest? We simply don't know,'' Shukla said.
``Our study is limited to the total deforestation.''
   The study was co-authored by Carlos Nobre and Piers Sellers,
also of the University of Maryland at College Park.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   Heavy metal rock star Ozzy Osbourne says he's
not into Satanism or drugs. He just wants to have fun.
   ``All I really do is have Halloween every night I'm on stage,''
Osbourne said in an interview scheduled to air today on Channel
One, the Whittle Communications news and information program for
teen-agers that began broadcasting into schools March 5.
   In a sermon earlier this month, Roman Catholic Cardinal John J.
O'Connor said that heavy-metal music spiked with satanic lyrics
created an atmosphere conducive to devil worship and demonic
possession.
   Osbourne said it wasn't so. ``There's no demonic message or
anything freaky about it, it's just a bit of fun for the night and
why not?''
   The rock star also said he condemns drug use.
   ``It's bad because you're living in a total fantasy world,'' he
said. ``When you think you're right, you're wrong and when you
think you're wrong, you can't make the right decision. I'm under
psychiatric help for what drugs have done to me and it's a sad
existence.''

   Actress Morgan Fairchild says she was abducted
years ago while visiting New York City for the first time, but has
since learned how to keep out of trouble by learning ``that New
York walk'' and talking tough.
   Fairchild, 40, said in an interview to be aired on ``The Joan
Rivers Show'' on Monday that she was abducted after traveling from
Dallas to Manhattan to visit her sister. She was 20.
   She said she was walking in Manhattan during the daytime when
two men forced her into a waiting cab.
   Fairchild said she screamed, but passers-by laughed. ``I guess
they thought I was one of the kidnappers' hookers or something,''
she said.
   She said she was terrified as they drove around New York. ``They
kept telling me all these horrible things they were going to do to
my body.''
   The actress said she started making jokes. ``Finally, one of
them looked at the other and said, `You know what? She's funny.
Let's let her go.' And they did.''
   Fairchild said she now knows when in New York not to set
``yourself up to be a victim. You have that New York walk and say
things like, `You touch me and I will kill you.'''

   ``Today'' co-host Bryant Gumbel said after his
memo that castigated Willard Scott and others on the show became
public, he couldn't get hold of the weatherman for a while. When he
did, he said they cried.
   Gumbel broke his yearlong public silence on the topic in an
interview with ``Today'' alumna Barbara Walters. The interview will
be shown today for Walters' ``20-20'' series on ABC.
   Gumbel, who has been on the ``Today'' since 1982, said there
have been days he's thought of leaving, but ``I still like the
job.''
   Since former co-host Jane Pauley departed at the end of
December, once No. 1 ``Today'' has been trailing ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' in the ratings. Gumbel, whose caustic memo to
Marty Ryan, then executive producer of ``Today,'' created a stir
when it was leaked to a newspaper last year, told Walters he likes
Scott and that they have a good relationship.
   In the memo, Gumbel said Scott ``holds the show hostage to his
assortment of whims, wishes, birthdays and bad taste,'' that movie
reviewer Gene Shalit's reviews ``are often late and his interviews
aren't very good,'' and that consumer reporter David Horowitz is
``a walking cliche.''
   Gumbel told Walters that when he finally reached Scott on the
telephone, ``we shed a lot of tears.''

   John F. Kennedy Jr. and the City University of
New York announced a program to further educate and train those who
work with the mentally and developmentally disabled.
   The program is for workers in low-paying jobs ``simply because
educational programs do not exist which would allow them to advance
in their careers and enhance their income,'' the school said in a
statement.
   The initiative will be financed funded by the Joseph P. Kennedy
Jr. Foundation. The first 10 Kennedy Fellows were named Thursday.
   ``Workers who care for retarded people share with their clients
the same right to achieve their fullest potential,'' Kennedy said.
   As things stand, however, ``the high turnover of staff disrupts
the trusting relationship that develops between client and staff,''
said Kennedy, a lawyer in the Manhattan district attorney's office.

   The 2nd Division also reported that Spec. John G. Dement, 27, of
Ovett, Miss., assigned to Headquarters Company, lst Battalion, 72nd
Armor, died after being found unconscious in a ditch March 7.
   They said Dement underwent surgery for a ruptured blood vessel
in his head but died Tuesday. No further details were given.
   The United States and South Korea began the two-week Team Spirit
military exercises Tuesday. About 19,000 U.S. troops joined the
43,000 American soldiers stationed in South Korea for the exercises.
   An OH-58 helicopter was one of two Army copters that crashed
Feb. 21 on training flights in Panama. Nine people were killed in
the crashes, which happened during a thunderstorm.

<HEAD>Attorney Told Keating He Had Regulators `Right Where You Want

<TEXT>
   An attorney's assurance that thrift owner
Charles H. Keating Jr. had federal regulators ``right where you
want them'' in 1988 is being cited as new evidence that he exerted
undue influence.
   The letter strongly suggests ``the fix was in'' for the owner of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, said Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, the House Banking Committee chairman who released it
Thursday.
   Margery Waxman, an attorney with Sidley &amp; Austin in Washington,
telecopied the letter to Keating on May 10, 1988, to prepare him
for a meeting with officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   ``You have the board right where you want them and you should be
able to reach an agreement ... which will completely satisfy you,''
she said. Waxman added that she had successfully ``put pressure
on'' M. Danny Wall, then chairman of the bank board and chief
regulator of thrift institutions.
   Banking panel aides refused to say how they obtained the letter.
   Wall, who quit earlier this month after harsh congressional
criticism of his handling of Lincoln, said he had never met with
Waxman concerning Keating. Her letter was ``a lawyer trying to
justify a fee,'' he said.
   The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, which
succeeded the bank board as S&amp;L regulator, said the letter ``was
riddled with errors and false conclusions.''
   Waxman's law firm denied in a statement that it applied
political pressure to the bank board or its employees. It said the
only pressure it exerted was advising the bank board that Keating
was considering filing a lawsuit.
   ``The letter indicates what has been generally understood for
some time. That is there were intensive negotiations going on at
the time with regard to a memo of understanding between Lincoln and
the bank board,'' said Leonard Bickwit, a Washington attorney
representing Keating's holding company, American Continental Corp.
   Keating is chairman of American Continental, owner of Irvine,
Calif.-based Lincoln. The thrift was seized by regulators last
April and is expected to require the nation's costliest S&amp;L bailout
at about $2 billion.
   At the time Waxman wrote, Keating was fighting federal efforts
to rein in his institution. Bank board examiners based in San
Francisco had recommended that the government take over Lincoln,
and Keating had appealed to authorities in Washington.
   ``As you know, I have put pressure on Wall to work toward
meeting your demands and he has so instructed his staff,'' Waxman
wrote. ``They all know the Wednesday meeting is crucial to their
future. If they mess up this time, it is all over.''
   Wall, however, said, ``I would not under any circumstances
threaten anybody with their job. That is not my character. That is
not my way of doing business.''
   The letter was written five days after a divided bank board
decided to move the Lincoln case from the jurisdiction of its San
Francisco office to Washington and on the same day Wall had a
telephone conversation with Keating.
   Waxman outlined what she expected to be the result of the
meeting, including a new examination of Lincoln and memorandum of
understanding between the institution and regulators, which was
executed five days later.
   ``San Francisco is finished,'' she assured Keating. ``There is
no going back to San Francisco and nothing can be done to follow up
their exam.''
   In the new exam, she said, ``nothing will be done ... that you
are not aware of in advance.''
   Also, she told Keating that bank board personnel ``will not be
able to enforce any violation (of the memorandum of understanding)
... without going to the board first. ... This will give you two
bites at the apple _ before the board and in court if necessary.''
   Gonzalez, the House Banking Committee chairman, said the letter
``tracks with amazing accuracy the actions taken by the board _
actions which were interpreted publicly as clamping down on
Lincoln.''
   ``In reality, as the letter carefully explains, the actions were
to be shams designed not to punish but to allow Keating an escape
route,'' he said.
   Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, a Republican member of the banking
panel, said, ``It's clear from the law firm's memo ... that Keating
had undue and unprecedented influence on the board. ... This memo
would appear to put Wall at the center point of directing in a
powerful, if not coercive, way his employees to abide by his
decision to go easy on Lincoln.''

<HEAD>Rural Development Bill Sidetracked by Killer Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reluctance by the House to change the
distribution system for federal rural development money has
temporarily sidetracked a bill designed to give new life to
decaying villages and towns.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza said an
amendment approved Thursday by the House killed ``the heart of the
bill as it exists now.''
   But he said, ``We can regroup.''
   ``The debate was inaccurate in many instances,'' de la Garza
said. ``The inaccuracies have to be corrected.''
   He said the members of the House are ``still committed to rural
development.'' He said the bill's supporters would take some time
to educate colleagues before seeking a final vote.
   The House Agriculture subcommittee on rural development, led by
chairman Glenn English, D-Okla., and ranking Republican Tom Coleman
of Missouri, spent nearly two years working on the legislation.
   Hearings were held throughout the country and in Washington to
determine the needs of residents of areas where consolidation of
farms has caused small businesses to suffer and population to
decline.
   However, the big problem lawmakers faced was a lack of money to
infuse into these dying communities.
   Their answer was to pool three existing funds: water and sewer,
which contains about $500 million to $600 million this year;
business and industry development, about $100 million; and
community facilities, about $100 million.
   The states could decide their own needs, spending all of their
allocation from the three funds on one area if necessary.
   But Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., contended the provision gave too
much power to the agriculture secretary and offered an amendment
that froze the three funds, prohibiting pooling.
   Under the original legislation, state review panels would set
priorities on projects, but the Agriculture Department would have
the final say on use of the money.
   Rose said that if his amendment were not adopted, the
agriculture secretary would have ``unprecedent, uncontrollable
authority to transfer money without input from Congress.''
   Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee and well known for his power over
agriculture programs, did not speak during the floor debate but
said earlier that pooling was ``a serious step backward'' that his
panel would ``write provisions to avoid'' if necessary.
   Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., said the bill's provision constituted
a ``modified block grant proposal. This scares me because
traditionally block grants have died a slow, withering death.''
   After an hour of debate, the House approved Rose's amendment,
204-193.
   English said the system that Rose's amendment preserves has
shown ``tremendous inequity'' among the states.
   He said that if a state doesn't use all of its share of water
and sewer money, for example, the funds go back to the federal
government and become available to any other states that apply for
it.
   English said the aggressiveness of the local Farmers Home
Administration directors has had a lot to do with how much of the
money a state gets.
   ``There are some FmHa directors who philosophically don't like
these programs, so they spend very little of it (the available
money),'' English said after the vote.
   De la Garza said time has been set aside next week for further
action on the bill, but did not say whether sponsors would try
again that soon or take more time to try to persuade members to
change their opinions.

   This was going to be the year that the abortion battle ran
head-on into the state legislatures _ the irresistible force

   So far, the immovable object is winning.
   Of more than 150 abortion-related bills introduced in

Dozens more have been killed or are dying a slow death in

   ``The issue is so hot, so controversial in many states that
legislators just don't want to deal with it in an election year,''
said Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League, a Washington-based lobbying group. ``They
want this issue to go away. They wish they could escape it.''
   Spokeswoman Nancy Myers of the National Right to Life Committee,
the largest anti-abortion lobbying group, agreed.
   She added, however, that legislative timidity has nothing to do
with the Supreme Court decision in Missouri's Webster case last
July. The case allowed states to limit access to serivces without
removing the federal right to abortion.
   ``Politicians would just as soon avoid the issue, and that was
no different before Webster. It's always been that way,'' she said.
   Abortion, explained Ohio Senate President Stanley Aronoff, is
``a no-win issue'' in an election year. For that reason, there is
almost no chance that Ohio will pass an abortion bill this year,
although two have been introduced.
   The story is similar elsewhere.
   Oklahoma legislators rejected 10 abortion bills in a single day
last month, leaving just one bill _ and it isn't expected to pass.
   In Missouri, 11 bills have been introduced; none is expected to
pass. Nine have been introduced in New York; all are expected to
die. In Iowa, three bills have been killed; two others are given
little chance.
   ``The problem is, this issue is so emotional,'' said Iowa state
Rep. Jane Svoboda. ``There is no opportunity for the two sides to
reach any kind of compromise. In the meantime, everybody suffers
and everybody loses.
   ``I really wonder about the national course we're on,'' she
added. ``This is not a black and white issue.''
   That's not to say that battles have been avoided in every state.
   Abortion has been a major issue this year in Michigan, South
Carolina, Minnesota and Idaho.
   It would have been in Pennsylvania, except that legislators
there passed the most sweeping abortion restrictions in the nation
late last year.
   The Michigan Legislature approved a measure requiring minors to
get a parent's consent, or a judge's waiver, before an abortion.
Gov. James Blanchard vetoed it, leading anti-abortion groups to
launch a petition drive to take the issue to voters.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell signed a similar bill _ the
one abortion bill that has made it into law. Nine other bills in
South Carolina have remained stuck in committees.
   Idaho has been the biggest battleground lately, and may
represent the best opportunity for anti-abortion forces to get the
Supreme Court to reconsider Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that
forced states to legalize abortion.
   An Idaho bill would outlaw abortion as a form of birth control,
allowing it only in cases of rape, incest, ``profound and
irremediable'' fetal disabilities or to preserve the mother's
health.
   A state House committee voted Wednesday to postpone action on
the bill until today so it can hear from more experts on the
constitutional issues involved in the bill.
   Ms. Myers said the National Right to Life Committee is
``cautiously optimistic'' about prospects for the bill, which she
said would ``surely'' be challenged in court if passed.
   Ms. Michelman of the Abortion Rights Action League agreed,
saying, ``We may lose there.'' She said the Idaho legislation ``is
designed to chip away at Roe, or overturn Roe completely.''
   Not all legislation has been proposed by abortion foes. Slightly
more than 25 bills this year have been supported by the
abortion-rights' side.
   But abortion rights advocates have fared no better than their
opposition.
   Their best shot may be in New Hampshire, where the House of
Representatives passed a bill repealing pre-Roe laws that outlawed
abortion and ensuring the unrestricted right to an abortion through
the 24th week of pregnancy.
   Even if that bill passes the Senate, Gov. Judd Gregg is expected
to veto it.
   Few bills across the nation will reach the governor's desk. Ms.
Michelman credits the high mortality rate to the Webster ruling,
which she said ``awakened the sleeping giant'' of the
abortion-rights movement.
   Ms. Myers, not surprisingly, sees it differently. She said the
anti-abortion movement never expected easy sledding after the
ruling.
   ``We're not expecting a whole lot of legislation to pass this
year,'' she said. ``There's a lot of legislation out there ... but
legislation takes a long time, and we're in it for the long haul.''

   Here is a state-by-state breakdown of abortion legislation so
far this year, excluding states in which no abortion bills have
been proposed:
   ALABAMA: Bill to regulate abortion clinics and require women to
undergo pre-abortion counseling passed House, pending in Senate.
Two other bills given little chance of passage.
   ALASKA: Bills pending to prohibit gender selection abortions,
require fetal tissue exams before abortion; both expected to die in
committee.
   ARIZONA: Nine bills pending; prospects uncertain. They include
informed consent, spousal notification; bans on gender selection,
abortion as birth control, use of public funds; providing funding
for abortion alternatives; regulating abortion clinics; outlawing
abortions except to save life of mother.
   CONNECTICUT: Five anti-abortion bills pending, including ban on
gender selection; parental and spousal notification; requiring
doctors to test ``viability'' of fetus after 20 weeks; informed
consent. One pro-choice bill to strike down unenforced law making
abortion illegal. Prospects uncertain; compromise possible.
   DELAWARE: One bill requiring parental or family court consent
for minors seeking abortion; expected to die in committee.
   FLORIDA: Legislature not in session until April 3. Senate
committee has endorsed bill to make abortion clinic records
available to state. Bills pending to stiffen penalties for blocking
clinic entrances; study clinic regulation.
   GEORGIA: Four abortion bills postponed until next year.
   HAWAII: Two bills died in committee. One required parental
notification; other appropriated money for women to carry babies to
term.
   IDAHO: Two bills passed House and sent to Senate; both expected
to pass. One outlaws abortion as form of birth control; other
repeals ``trigger'' law making abortion illegal if Roe vs. Wade is
overturned. Ten other abortion bills died.
   ILLINOIS: Two bills, one requiring viability tests after 20
weeks, barring use of public employees or facilities; other
allowing state health insurance to pay for abortions. Passage
considered difficult for both.
   INDIANA: Bills requiring informed consent and banning use of
public facilities were passed by House, defeated by Senate.
Viability testing bill died in committee.
   IOWA: House defeated bills to gather abortion statistics;
prohibit abortions at University of Iowa hospital. Three other
bills expected to die.
   KANSAS: Parental notification bill passed House, sent to Senate;
has governor's support but expected to be amended. Three other
bills pending, given little chance of passage.
   KENTUCKY: Bills pending to require doctor to determine viability
of fetus; prohibit abortions ``for reasons of convenience.''
Prospects uncertain.
   MARYLAND: Four anti-abortion bills and one pro-choice bill
pending. The former forbid abortions for gender selection or birth
control; require abortions to be performed in hospitals; allow them
only in cases of rape, incest, deformity or when the mother's
health is at stake; require parental consent for minors. None
expected to pass. The latter protects right to abortion if Roe vs.
Wade overturned. Prospects uncertain.
   MASSACHUSETTS: Pro-choice bills would prohibit state from
interfering in reproductive decisions, wipe out century-old
``Crimes Against Chastity'' laws. Anti-abortion bills require
spousal notification; set fetal viability at 20 weeks, instead of
24; ban counselors from advising minors to have abortions in other
states. Prospects uncertain, but Gov. Michael Dukakis would likely
veto anti-abortion bills.
   MICHIGAN: Parental consent bill passed by Legislature and vetoed
by Gov. James Blanchard. Anti-abortion forces now preparing
petition drive to put the measure before voters. Other abortions
measures expected to die in committee.
   MINNESOTA: More than a dozen bills introduced. The most
attention has been given to bills that would ban abortion except in
cases of rape, incest, deformity or to save the health of the
mother; ban abortion after the 23rd week, with some exceptions; ban
most abortions after 20 weeks. Prospects uncertain.
   MISSISSIPPI: Bill to license abortion clinics passed Senate and
is pending in House. Prospects uncertain. Two other anti-abortion
bills killed.
   MISSOURI: Eleven bills introduced; none expected to pass. Only
one to receive a hearing so far would add right to privacy to state
Constitution, preventing state from intervening in abortions.
   NEBRASKA: Bills pending to require parental notification and
informed consent. Neither expected to pass this session.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE: House killed bills declaring life begins at
conception, prohibiting use of public funds. House passed a third
bill that establishes right to abortion through the 24th week. Some
pro-choice measure is expected to pass Senate, but probably would
be vetoed.
   NEW JERSEY: Bill pending to require parental notification for
minors, with some exceptions.
   NEW YORK: Nine bills introduced; none likely to pass. They
include parental consent, ban on medicaid funding, ban on abortions
after in vitro fertilization and ban on state collecting
information about abortion patients.
   OHIO: Bills introduced to prohibit abortions after 24th week,
require informed consent. Neither expected to pass.
   OKLAHOMA: A House committee killed 10 abortion bills in
February, leaving only one parental notification bill before the
Legislature. It is considered likely to pass Senate, unlikely to
pass House.
   PENNSYLVANIA: About a dozen abortion-related bills pending, but
none considered likely to pass. They include pro-choice measures to
assure a woman's right to an abortion and restore public funding
for abortions.
   RHODE ISLAND: Bills pending to strengthen ban on public funds,
strengthen a parental notification law; also to require spousal
notification, define a fetus as a person in wrongful death cases
and prohibit investment of state funds in companies making
``abortion pills.'' Pro-choice package would repeal funding and
insurance bans, overturn existing spousal notification law,
prohibit discrimination in the use of public facilities and block
government interference in woman's right to decide. Prospects
uncertain.
   SOUTH CAROLINA: Parental consent bill signed by Gov. Carroll
Campbell on Feb. 28. Nine other bills considered unlikely to pass.
   TENNESSEE: Bill to repeal insurance requirement for abortion
clinics was killed, but attorney general later said requirement was
illegal. Bill prohibiting abortion for birth control was withdrawn.
Gov. Ned McWherter's appropriation bill includes ban on state
funding of abortion. Prospects uncertain.
   UTAH: Two anti-abortion measures withdrawn, replaced by
non-binding resolution declaring Legislature's opposition to
abortion.
   VERMONT: Five anti-abortion bills introduced, including four
parental notification bills and one state funding ban. None
expected to pass.
   VIRGINIA: Bills introduced to ban abortions for sex selection,
require a patient's informed consent and require parental
notification for minors. Parental notification the only bill to
survive an initial committee vote; it passed House of Delegates and
died in Senate.
   WASHINGTON: Senate killed two pro-choice measures to stiffen
penalties for protesters who block access to clinics and create
programs to combat teen pregnancy.
   WEST VIRGINIA: Several bills introduced, all died in committee.
They included spousal notification, informed consent and ban on
state funding. House and Senate amended budget to ban state-funded
abortions for poor women.
   WISCONSIN: Parental consent bill passed Assembly, is pending in
Senate; unlikely to be approved. Assembly defeated bill to abolish
old abortion penalties that are no longer enforced.
   WYOMING: Bill to repeal parental notification law was turned
down before introduction.

   When Willie Mae Newberry moved to Boston's inner
city in 1968 after a lifetime spent in a small Georgia town, she
was hoping for a better life. Instead, she's seen her family
devastated by violent crime.
   Since 1987, two of her daughters and a son-in-law have been
gunned down. Another son died mysteriously in Boston in 1974.
   The day after her daughter, Delores, 33, was shot to death this
week, Newberry, 65, sat in a corner of her living room, staring at
a flickering TV screen. She was surrounded by the grandchildren she
must now raise on her own.
   ``It's something you can't describe,'' she said about the
violence that has caused Boston's murder rate to soar. ``Some of
them can cope with it and some of them can't.''
   Newberry showed no emotion as she gazed out her apartment
window. Her grandson Shariff, 15, sat to one side; her
granddaughter Shahera, 10, on the other.
   The children's mother, Delores Newberry Gandy, was fatally shot
Tuesday night while wielding a pitchfork trying to protect her
children from suspected gang members who were trying to set fire to
her apartment. Their father, Percy Gandy, was shot to death in a
Roxbury housing project last summer.
   Mrs. Gandy was the mother of five children ranging in age from
18 months to 17 years and the grandmother of two infants.
   ``It's hard to explain,'' Shariff said about his feelings for
his mother. He fingered a pencil and stared at the TV. ``She used
to take us places and stuff. She watched out for us.''
   His sister did not want to talk. She slumped in an armchair,
playing with an infant toy.
   But Willie Mae Newberry said she's become almost hardened to the
violence. She didn't even flinch, she said, when a nurse from the
hospital called the other night and said her daughter was dead. She
didn't crack when she had to go down to the hospital to identify
her body.
   ``It don't make me angry, I have to accept it,'' said Newberry.
``Any mother misses her child but she's gone and she ain't going to
come back and I don't let it get next to me. But I don't know what
we're going to do about that violence out there.''
   Thirty-two people have been murdered in Boston this year, up
from 21 during the same period last year. On Thursday, city and
state officials called for a crackdown on inner city drugs and
violence.
   Newberry gave birth to 10 children but only six are alive. One
daughter died of diphtheria at 9 months old when the family lived
in Cordele, Ga. Newberry and her husband, James, moved to Boston in
1968 in the hope of finding more work and a better life.
   Six years later, Newberry discovered her son, James Jr., dead in
his apartment. She said she does not know what killed him.
   In 1987, Willie Ann Newberry was shot to death by her boyfriend.
Her two children live with Willie Mae Newberry.
   But the grandmother remained stoic as she recited her family's
grim history.
   ``It's the will of the Lord,'' she said. ``He's the one who
lifts me up and keeps me going.''
   Most of the time, Newberry lives a quiet life. She likes to walk
to the park, watch TV and play with her grandchildren.
   ``She's a very strong person,'' said Carrie Haygood, 35, one of
the friends gathered in Newberry's apartment Thursday. ``She sits
there taking it and keeping it together. People are dying out there
and her kids are dying and she keeps it together. I thank the Lord
I don't have kids.''

   The deep political and emotional disagreement
over abortion divided a congressional panel as it opened hearings
into recent state restrictions on a woman's right to end her
pregnancy.
   The chairman of the House panel, Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif.,
drew opposition Thursday when he refused to allow an anti-abortion
witness to show videotapes of a fetus inside the womb. Edwards is a
sponsor of a bill that would write broad guarantees of abortion
rights into federal law.
   An anti-abortion member, Rep. James F. Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
challenged Edwards' ruling and, after losing on a party-line vote,
walked out of the meeting. He denounced ``this charade'' and
accused majority Democrats of ``gagging the witness.''
   Edwards' Judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional
rights held its first hearing on the so-called ``freedom of
choice'' bill with a look at the effect of a Missouri law
restricting abortions.
   The Supreme Court upheld that law in a ruling last year that
energized the political debate on abortion.
   Appearing on a panel of abortion-rights supporters, a Missouri
woman and a physician testified that the restrictions have left
some women unable to obtain safe abortions even when they face
life-threatening complications.
   Maralee Dinsdale of Carrollton, Mo., described three difficult
and unsuccessful pregnancies, including a third last year when
tests revealed she carried an anencephalic baby _ a fetus that had
not developed a skull or brain and would not live long if brought
to term and delivered.
   ``I was denied a needed medical procedure that could save my
life,'' she said.
   She said she also had a history of bleeding and other
complications, and decided to have an abortion. Because of the
Missouri law, she said, her doctor was denied permission to perform
the abortion at the two hospitals where he practiced and referred
her to a clinic _ not a hospital _ in neighboring Kansas.
   There, Mrs. Dinsdale said, she suffered heavy bleeding and other
complications after the abortion and was rushed to a hospital 20
miles away, where she recovered.
   ``I was emotionally drained and scared to death, but I felt I
had no choice,'' she said. ``No hospital would help me, my doctor
had more or less abandoned me, and I truly felt it would endanger
my life more by carrying the baby to term _ in a sense, for
nothing.''
   The Missouri law prohibits abortions from being performed at
public hospitals, bans tax dollars from being spent for
``encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions and requires
doctors to determine when possible whether a fetus of 20 or more
weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb.
   Mrs. Dinsdale said she was denied an abortion at private
hospitals, even though the Missouri law bans them only at public
institutions.
   Dr. Howard I. Schwartz, a Kansas City, Mo., obstetrician and
gynecologist, said that because of the law both private and public
hospitals often refer women seeking abortions elsewhere _ even when
the fetus has major abnormalities, or the woman suffers diseases
that could be life-threatening if she remains pregnant.
   The subcommittee's dispute arose when a second panel of
witnesses, all abortion opponents, testified.
   Sharleen R. Richard, a radiologic technologist from Michigan,
wanted to show examples of a new sonograph technology providing
high-quality images of the fetus at an early stage of pregnancy.
   ``I have personally seen many women change their mind after they
see that little baby in the womb,'' she said.
   But Edwards said the subcommittee had ``a general rule'' against
showing videotapes. Sensenbrenner protested the panel had no such
rule and invited Mrs. Richard to turn on her videotape machine and
television. When she moved to do so, Edwards ruled her out of order.
   The subcommittee plans more hearings, although sponsors have not
decided whether to seek a vote on the bill. Similar hearings are
scheduled in the Senate.

   Every city police officer will receive a list
bearing the names of 105 hard-core, violent gang members with
outstanding warrants against them under a new attack on urban crime
proposed by Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Jolted by the recent crime wave that has pushed the city's
murder rate 50 percent higher than the same period last year, more
than two dozen state, city and federal officials joined Flynn's
call for a crackdown on inner city drugs and violence at a hastily
called summit Thursday afternoon.
   Flynn organized the meeting following the rash of violence
Tuesday night that left three dead and several other people
wounded. Thirty-two people have been murdered in Boston this year,
up from 21 during the same period last year. The mayor proposed a
program to combat violence centered on a plan to find and arrest
gang members who have defaulted on court appearances.
   He also recommended eliminating loopholes in a law mandating a
one-year sentence for criminals in possession of illegal weapons,
reducing delays in bringing to trial those accused of drug crimes
or violent crimes, expanding prison space and offering drug
treatment on demand.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis, who also attended the meeting, suggested
the appointment of a task force including one federal
representative to meet daily to close in on gang members.
   Flynn's plan was prompted in part by a report issued by the
Boston Bar Association Thursday that said the state criminal
justice system lacks the resources to fight the war on drugs.

   Astrologer Joan Quigley says she didn't intend
to write a book about her influence in Ronald Reagan's presidency _
until she read what Nancy Reagan said about it.
   ``It reads like fiction and much of it is evasive,'' she wrote
in her new book about Nancy's book. ``What she has left out would
fill a book.''
   ``No political decision was ever made based on it,'' Mrs. Reagan
said in ``My Turn'' of Mrs. Quigley's readings of the moon, the sun
and the planets.
   ``Through Nancy, I had a direct line to the president,'' said
Ms. Quigley in her memoirs, ``What Does Joan Say?''
   Said Donald Regan, the fired presidential aide who first
revealed in his memoirs, ``For the Record,'' that Mrs. Reagan was
consulting an astrologer: ``Virtually every major move and decision
the Reagans made during my time as White House chief of staff was
cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew up
horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable
alignment for the enterprise.''
   Here are excepts from the three books on the question of Ms.
Quigley's role:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   DONALD REGAN:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Nancy Reagan seemed to have absolute faith in the clairvoyant
powers of this woman, who had predicted that `something' bad was
going to happen to the president shortly before he was wounded in
an assassination attempt in 1981. ...''
   ``There was no choice but to humor the first lady in this
matter. But the president's schedule is the single most potent tool
in the White House, because it determines what the most powerful
man in the world is going to do and when he is going to do it. By
humoring Mrs. Reagan we gave her this tool _ or more accurately,
gave it to an unknown woman in San Francisco who believed that the
Zodiac controls events and human behavior and that she could read
the secrets of the future in the movements of the planets.''

   NANCY REAGAN:

<TEXT>
   ``My relationship with Joan Quigley began as a crutch, one of
several ways I tried to alleviate my anxiety about Ronnie (after
the March 30, 1981, attempt on his life). Within a year or two, it
had become a habit, something I relied on a little less but didn't
see the need to change. ...
   ``I want to state one thing again, and unequivocally: Joan's
recommendations had nothing to do with policy or politics _ ever.
Her advice was confined to timing _ to Ronnie's schedule, and to
what days were good or bad, especially with regard to his
out-of-town trips.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   JOAN QUIGLEY:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Through Nancy, I had a direct line to the president. That the
astrological work I did for both Reagans affected the top level of
government is now a matter of history. ...
   ``I was responsible for timing all press conferences, most
speeches, the State of the Union addresses, the takeoffs and
landings of Air Force One. I picked the time of Ronald Reagan's
debate with (Jimmy) Carter and the two debates with Walter Mondale;
all extended trips abroad as well as the shorter trips and one-day
excursions, the announcement that Reagan would run for a second
term, briefings for all the summits except Moscow, although I
selected the time to begin the Moscow trip.
   ``I timed congressional arm-twisting, the second inaugural oath
of office, the announcement of Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court
nomination. ...''
   ```Ronnie's `Evil Empire' attitude has to go before he can meet
with Mikhail Gorbachev at Geneva,' I told her. `Gorbachev's
Aquarian planet is in such harmony with Ronnie's, you'll see,' I
said. `They'll share a vision. What's more, when Ronnie and
Gorbachev meet, they'll get along famously, better than you can
imagine if _ and this is a very big if _ Ronnie goes to Geneva with
the proper attitude.'
   ```I know you are right,' Nancy said. `But it won't be easy to
change Ronnie. First, I'll have to persuade him. You know as well
as I do how he feels about Russian leaders. I'll have to make him
realize what you say about Gorbachev is true.'''

   Some folks in this hard-luck railroad town
don't think much of the walkout by West Virginia's teachers.
   ``People around here can't really relate to the supposed plight
of a person making $22,000 a year. ... If you're making that much,
you're well above the average person around here. And that's for
nine months work,'' said Thomas M. Mason, owner of a local
remodeling business.
   This mountain town of about 6,000, about 110 miles southeast of
Pittsburgh, has seen Union and Confederate raiders fighting over
its once vital rail hub. But the railroad jobs are all but gone,
shuttered businesses line Main Street and coal does little to spark
a sputtering economy.
   Now Grafton's schools, the town's largest employer, are idle.
Teachers here were among the first to walk out a week ago, when
thousands of West Virginia's educators struck over the state's
refusal to grant pay raises.
   Only South Dakota and Arkansas pay teachers less than West
Virginia, according to the National Education Association.
   Teachers in 47 of the state's 55 counties remained on strike
Thursday despite threats by state officials that they would be
fired if they don't return to work.
   Mason said he doesn't think Taylor County's 205 teachers have
much to complain about in an area where unemployment reached 11
percent two months ago and the average salary was $8,650 in 1987.
   ``Some might think they're doing pretty good,'' Mason said.
   Annual salaries in the district range from $16,109 for a
starting teacher with a bachelor's degree to $29,123 for a teacher
with 20 years' experience, a master's degree plus 30 additional
credits, according to the West Virginia Education Association.
Enrollment in the district has dropped 23 percent since 1980.
   ``The average man on the street is going to have a blue-collar
job around here,'' said Guy Linda Moyer, a speech pathologist for
the school district. ``This strike is about people who have
invested thousands of dollars in an education in order to get their
jobs.
   ``We have different aspirations and goals than they have,'' Ms.
Moyer said. ``That's not to say ours are any better. Just
different.''
   ``The people are pretty much divided,'' said L.N. Thorp, 68, as
he sopped up a breakfast of biscuits and gravy at a local diner.
   ``There's a lot of people who are against the strike and
anything they think is going to cost them even 10 cents more on
their tax bill. But I think there's more people for the teachers
than against them,'' said Thorp, who retired from CSX Corp. after
40 years as a freight car inspector.
   Television game shows and afternoons at the playground have
replaced reading, writing and arithmetic for Debra Lyons'
7-year-old twins.
   ``They're driving me crazy, right up the wall. Aren't they ever
going to go back to school? I've had it,'' Mrs. Lyons said as she
separated her roughhousing first-graders, Jason and Jessica.
   Some enterprising pupils are making a few dollars during the
strike.
   Seventh-grader Andi Peters, 13, is earning $15 a day watching
two children.
   ``I'm going on a trip to the Virgin Islands this summer and this
will help pay for it,'' she said. ``It's fun, but I wish the
teachers would go back. They're taking our education away. They
should find another way to get what they want.''
   In Charleston, 115 miles southwest, the focus of the strike
moved from the governor's office and picket lines to the courts as
state officials sought judges' orders to force teachers back to
work.
   Schoolchildren were off Thursday and today after state School
Superintendent Hank Marockie called a statewide ``cooling off
period'' in the strike.

<HEAD>Astrologer Claims Influence Over Reagan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An astrologer claims she was responsible
for revising Ronald Reagan's attitude toward the Soviet Union and
timing everything from press conferences to the former president's
cancer surgery.
   ``Ronnie's `evil empire' attitude has to go before he can meet
with Mikhail Gorbachev at Geneva,'' Joan Quigley, Nancy Reagan's
astrologer for seven years, claims to have advised the former first
lady. ``Gorbachev's Aquarian planet is in such harmony with
Ronnie's, you'll see ... They'll share a vision.''
   Ms. Quigley also claims in a new book released Thursday that she
changed Mrs. Reagan's image, encouraging her to stop talking about
fashion and devote herself to the anti-drug campaign.
   She said in an interview Wednesday that former White House chief
of staff Donald Regan's book, ``For the Record,'' which disclosed
Mrs. Reagan's consultations with an astrologer, ``was the first
part of the trilogy and Nancy's book (``My Turn'') tried to sweep
it all under the carpet.''
   In her book, Ms. Quigley says ``My Turn'' ``reads like fiction
and much of it is evasive.''
   Mrs. Reagan wrote that while Ms. Quigley was ``helpful and
comforting ... a kind of therapist,'' she had influence solely on
Reagan's schedule.
   Asked for a comment on Quigley's book, a spokesman for the
Reagans in Los Angeles, Mark Weinberg, said: ``We will not have
anything to add to what is in Mrs. Reagan's book.''
   Ms. Quigley said in her new book that she had a direct line to
the former president through his wife.
   ``I was responsible for timing all press conferences, most
speeches, the State of the Union Addresses, the takeoffs and
landings of Air Force One,'' she wrote in ``What Does Joan Say?''
   ``I timed congressional arm-twisting, the second inaugural oath
of office, the announcement of Anthony Kennedy's Supreme Court
nomination. I delayed President Reagan's operation for cancer from
July 10, 1985, to July 13, and chose the time for Nancy's
mastectomy.''
   Ms. Quigley said that before Reagan's first summit with Soviet
leader Gorbachev, she worked three hours to persuade Mrs. Reagan
that her husband could trust him. She said she ``battled her to the
mat'' to get Reagan's view of Gorbachev changed.
   ``Gorbachev's chart leads me to believe that he is different''
from past Soviet leaders, Ms. Quigley said she told Mrs. Reagan.
``The placement of his ruler, Mercury, in the tenth house of power
and position convinces me that Gorbachev came to power not only
because he had been favored by powerful older men, but also because
of his high degree of intelligence.''
   After working for free for the Reagans during the first
presidential campaign, Quigley said she agreed in 1981 to help Mrs.
Reagan improve her public image and was paid each month through a
friend.
   Quigley writes that she advised Mrs. Reagan to focus on her two
pet programs _ drug rehabilitation and foster grandparents _ and to
play down all her privileged social connections.
   At the end of the tutoring, though, when Mrs. Reagan couldn't
give a reporter an example of something she had found particularly
touching in the course of her anti-drug work, Quigley concludes:
   ``My pupil was a consummate actress, but I couldn't help feeling
that while she had worked hard and studied diligently, she had
never really understood the reason for taking the course.''

<HEAD>President Says Some Economic Signs `Worry Me'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says he remains generally
optimistic about the U.S. economy, but there are some signs ``that
worry me.''
   Among other problems, the nation's bulging deficit is making it
impossible to give new democracies in Eastern Europe and Central
America the aid they deserve, Bush said.
   ``I sometimes wish as president that there were more funds
readily available _ read that less of a deficit,'' he told a group
of newspaper executives on Thursday.
   ``There's a great deal that we have to do to keep this expansion
going,'' Bush said. ``The economy at this moment isn't as robust as
I'd like to see it.''
   He asserted that congressional approval of his proposals for a
lower capital gains tax and educational reforms would help make the
nation more competitive aboard.
   ``If we're successful, then we're going to have not a peace
dividend but a growth dividend,'' Bush told members of the National
Newspaper Association.
   The president rejected the notion that America was in decline.
   ``We still have the highest standard of living in the world,''
he said. ... So I am not that pessimistic, and yet I don't want to
stand here with some Pollyannnish attitude about the economy. There
are some signs that worry me.''
   Economic growth as measured by the gross national product
slumped to an anemic 0.9 percent in the final three months of 1989
and many economists also are projecting a slow first quarter of
1990. American manufacturing has been in the doldrums for months.
   Appearing before the congressional Joint Economic Committee on
Thursday, White House budget director Richard Darman said the
economy's poor performance in the final quarter of 1989 would add
$6.2 billion to the projected budget deficit for next year.
   The added red ink would be in the $12 billion to $15 billion
range if the economy rebounds only gradually, he said.
   Before the new economic performance figures became available,
the administration had estimated that the shortfall for fiscal 1991
_ which begins next Oct. 1 _ would be $100.5 billion.
   Bush, in a speech earlier Thursday to the National Association
of Manufacturers, said: ``Our economy is not perfect and I don't
want to paint an unrealistic picture.''
   But he added that democratic upheavals in the world present the
opportunity for U.S. companies to capture new markets. Changes in
Eastern Europe and Central America ``mark the triumph not only of
free ideas but also of free markets,'' he said.
   On other subjects in his meeting with newspaper executives, Bush:
   _Praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a ``reasonable
man'' and said he was not concerned because Gorbachev's powers have
been strengthened by the Soviet parliament. He said there was
``much less of a danger today'' from the Kremlin than in the past.
   _Expressed irritation with American volunteers in Nicaragua, who
he said were intent on keeping the outgoing leftist government in
power. ``Now they're picketing ... in front of the U.S. Embassy
because in their view the wrong people won the election.''
   _Said that last week's speculation that an American hostage in
Lebanon might be released ``frankly confused me'' because there are
no negotiations going on involving the U.S. government. ``I wish I
could tell you that there was a serious, immediate effort that
would pay off, but that isn't the case,'' he said.
   _Expressed opposition to suggestions that U.S. aid be cut to
Israel and Egypt to make money available for emerging democracies
in Eastern Europe. ``I don't want to suggest cutting to good
friends,'' the president said, adding that he would like greater
flexibility to disburse foreign aid.
   Bush was not asked about a fire that caused extensive damage at
a Libyan plant the United States suspects of making chemical
weapons. However, he answered with a firm ``no'' earlier Thursday
when asked at a picture-taking session in the Capitol if there was
any U.S. involvement in the Libyan fire.
   Administration officials said the plant had been knocked out of
commission by a serious fire. ``We don't have any idea who did
it,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

   The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo Friday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell moderately.
   The dollar ended the week at 152.50 yen, up 0.03 yen from
Thursday's close of 152.47 yen. After opening at 152.25 yen, the
U.S. currency ranged between 152.20 yen and 152.63 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 55.20
points, or 0.17 percent, closing the week at 32,616.44. The index
gained 319.51 points Thursday.
   Currency dealers said market sentiment for the dollar remained
bullish.
   ``Trading was relatively quiet as prospects for a hike in the
official discount rate have faded away, at least for now,'' said
Shinji Tanaka, a dealer with Mitsui Bank.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, returning from a nine-day
European trip, told a news conference Thursday there was no change
in the central bank's stance of monitoring the effects of its last
rate hike.
   There had been speculation in the market that Japan's central
bank might raise its discount rate by as much as 1 percentage point
from the current 4.25 percent, in effect since last December, to
stop the yen's downswing.
   The discount rate, the interest rate charged on loans by the
central bank to commercial banks, has a strong effect on other
interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to discourage stock
traders.
   The benchmark No. 119 government bond price rose to 86.67 points
as of 3 p.m. (1 a.m. EST), up from Thursday's close at 86.33. The
yield fell 0.070 percentage points to 7.205 percent.

<HEAD>Peace Corps Considers Helping Panama Rebuild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Peace Corps official says the agency may
send volunteers to Panama to help that country rebuild from the
December U.S. invasion and nearly three years of economic sanctions.
   ``Discussions are going on'' with the Panama government, Jody
Olsen, chief of staff for the agency, said Thursday night.
   ``We are assessing ... the possibility of sending in a few
volunteers'' to work in rural areas with other aid specialists as
part of an overall Panama aid package, she said.
   A Peace Corps team will visit Panama next week to study
logistics of how many volunteers could be used, where they might
work and what they might do, said Olsen.
   The Bush administration has asked Congress for $500 million in
aid for Panama this fiscal year and $300 million for Nicaragua, two
countries in Central America making the transition to democracy.
   The December U.S. invasion that overthrew Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega in Panama was succeeded by the U.S.-backed administration
of Guillermo Endara, which has expressed interest in Peace Corps
volunteers.
   But the Sandinista government defeated in the Feb. 25 elections
is not scheduled to leave office under april 25, and Ms. Olsen said
it was ``too early'' to tell whether Nicaragua would seek Peace
Corps detachments.
   Olsen was responding to questions about a remark made by
President Bush earlier in the day when asked if he would send Peace
Corps teams to see that aid gets to the poor villagers of those
countries.
   ``Yes,'' Bush answered. ``I'm strongly in favor of the Peace
Corps. I've talked to our Peace Corps director. It's not _ you
know, it's not quite right there.''
   The president then complained about Americans who have gone to
Nicaragua ``allegedly to help the people of Nicaragua,'' and ``now
they're picketing ... in front of the U.S. embassy because in their
view the wrong people won the election.''
   ``They ought to stay down there if they're acting in this
philanthropic way and try to help as the Peace Corps does,'' the
president said. His remarks never returned to plans for the Peace
Corps.
   Dennis Marker, director of a church-based group known as Witness
for Peace, said Bush apparently was talking about his organization.
   ``We have had U.S. citizens demonstrating in front of the
embassy since 1983,'' Marker said. ``The reason people are
demonstrating is not because of who won the election. We are
demonstrating against continued U.S. interference in Nicaragua.''

<HEAD>Nation's Tuberculosis Rate Still Falling _ But Very Slowly, Due to
AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A steady decline in tuberculosis has all but
stopped amid the continuing threat of TB for the AIDS-infected,
federal health researchers say.
   In 1988, the last year for which complete statistics are
available, 22,436 U.S. tuberculosis cases were reported, down 0.4
percent from 1987, the national Centers for Disease Control
reported Thursday. That slight drop compares with an average annual
decrease of 6.7 percent from 1981 to 1984.
   One reason for the slowing of progress in wiping out TB is ``the
increasing occurrence of TB in persons infected with ... HIV,'' the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the CDC said.
   AIDS leaves the body susceptible to a number of serious
illnesses, including TB, and studies have found that about 4
percent of AIDS patients also are listed as TB patients.
   If the 6.7 percent average annual decline had kept up through
the late 1980s, an estimated 14,768 fewer TB cases would have been
expected during 1985-1988, the CDC said in its weekly report.
   Tuberculosis was down 8.7 percent among whites in 1988, as
compared with 1985, but up 9.1 percent among blacks and 17.6
percent among Hispanics _ two groups with proportionately higher
rates of AIDS cases.
   In 1988, 7,720 new tuberculosis cases were reported in whites,
compared with 8,280 in blacks and 3,637 in Hispanics. The TB rate
among blacks was 28.3 per 100,000, compared with 18.3 for Hispanics
and 4.1 for whites. Another 2,371 TB cases were reported among
Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, for a rate of
36.3 per 100,000.
   The CDC estimates that 10 million Americans are infected with
the bacteria that cause tuberculosis, an infection of the lungs.
The vast majority will never become ill.
   But the number of new cases is only part of the toll from
tuberculosis, the CDC said. In 1987, more than 115,000 Americans
were under TB treatment: 20,000 new patients plus 95,000 people
labeled high-risk and on preventive therapy.
   Tuberculosis, which is curable in most cases with drug
treatment, killed 1,755 Americans in 1987.

<HEAD>In Policy Shift, Gov't Turns Again To Destroying Coca Fields</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTA LUCIA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teams of workers armed with gas-powered
weed cutters are destroying clandestine plots of coca seedlings,
reflecting a policy change by Peru following the drug summit in
Colombia last month.
   Peruvian police and U.S. anti-drug agents are supervising the
small-scale operations in the coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley,
targeting isolated fields of young plants before they can be
transplanted to larger areas.
   The move to destroy the coca fields marks a renewal of a
government policy suspended more than a year ago. An alarming
increase in acres planted has prompted the government to renew the
eradication program, according to U.S. Embassy spokesman Gene
Bigler.
   ``(The Peruvian government) has asked us for our support in
eradication, and, of course, we're delighted,'' Bigler said.
   President Alan Garcia had temporarily halted joint anti-drug
operations and threatened to boycott the February drug meeting with
President Bush and the leaders of Colombia and Bolivia because of
the U.S. invasion of Panama in December. He later attended.
   The eradication teams operate out of the U.S.-built base at
Santa Lucia, 265 miles northeast of Lima in the Upper Huallaga
Valley, the world's richest source of coca leaf.
   About 350 eradication workers are stationed in the area along
with about 120 Peruvian police and 30 to 40 U.S. drug agents,
contracted American helicopter pilots and mechanics.
   Ten UH-1 helicopters on loan from the State Department ferry the
workers from the base to clandestine seedling plots, hidden under
the dense jungle canopy throughout the valley.
   Despite a drastic drop in price over the last six months for
Peruvian coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine, Peruvians
continue to move into the valley hoping to get rich off the cocaine
trade.
   ``They're cutting down all the trees,'' said Gen. Juan Zarate,
head of Peru's drug police, from the back seat of a Huey helicopter
cutting through the heavy jungle air 500 feet above the valley
floor.
   Zarate pointed out new coca plantations carved out of the jungle
hillsides, creating a haphazard patchwork of emerald hues up and
down the valley.
   ``There's going to be so much environmental damage,'' he said.
   Zarate was taking reporters to visit a herbicide test site,
where government scientists were studying the environmental effects
of applying the herbicide Spike to illegal coca fields.
   Spike is one of a number of eradication methods under study.
U.S. officials favor its use, saying testing so far indicate it
does not cause ecological damage. But the Peruvian government has
said more tests need to be done before it would consider using the
chemical.
   The Cartagena Accord signed during the summit by President Bush,
Garcia and the presidents of Bolivia and Colombia, linked
eradication to development aid and the opening of U.S. markets to
crops such as coffee, cocoa and palm oil to give the coca growers
alternative means of support.
   However, the Bush administration has said it is reluctant to
fund development projects with Peru's 3,000 percent inflation and a
growing leftist insurgency by Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, who
operate freely in much of the valley.
   Since September, the police have conducted raids against
airstrips and jungle laboratories used by smugglers to transform
the leaves into a semi-refined paste and ship it to Colombia, where
it is made into cocaine.
   The police have destroyed about 125 labs since September,
according to an embassy official.
   But despite interdiction efforts in Peru and Colombia, where
authorities have confiscated hundreds of airplanes used by the
smugglers, a recent U.S. government report says the number of acres
planted in coca in the Andean nations grew by 12 percent last year.
   More than 250,000 people are involved in growing and processing
the drug in Peru, bringing more than $1 billion a year into the
country, according to U.S. and Peruvian government estimates.
   The government estimates that coca grows on half a million acres
in Peru, with 60 percent of it in the Huallaga Valley.
   As the helicopter swooped over a small ridge, Zarate looked down
on a woman and child standing next to a thatched hut with their
latest coca harvest drying in the sun nearby.
   ``What we need is to give these people something else to do so
they stop moving in here,'' the general said.

<HEAD>Little Rock Case Prompts Infant Formula Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Babies should not be given soy-based beverages
other than infant formulas as their only source of nutrition, the
Food and Drug Administration warns.
   The FDA said Thursday that the soy-based drinks, sometimes
called ``soy milk,'' do not have the nutrients needed for infants.
   A 5-month-old baby girl whose parents bought the product in a
health food store was in critical condition at Arkansas Children's
Hospital in Little Rock because of malnourishment, the agency said
in a statement. It did not identify the girl or her parents.
   The statement said the parents mistakenly believed a soy
beverage sold in a health food store could be used as infant
formula, and had fed it to their daughter almost since birth.
   Soy beverages analyzed by the Little Rock hospital were found to
be lacking in calcium, niacin and vitamins D, E and C, the agency
said.
   The FDA said children and adults can drink the soy beverages as
long as they are part of an otherwise balanced diet.
   There are soy-based infant formulas that are ``complete and
appropriate,'' and these formulas are not involved in Thursday's
warning, the agency said.

   President Bush has selected a Michigan real
estate executive to serve on the board overseeing the savings and
loan bailout.
   Robert C. Larson, chief executive officer of the Taubman Company
in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., was named Thursday to one of two vacant
seats on the five-member Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who heads the board, said
he expects the White House to announce the fifth member next week.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing Secretary Jack
Kemp also are members.
   The board sets policy and controls the purse strings of the
bailout agency created last August.
   Congressional Democrats have complained that Bush waited until
after most of the bailout policies were in place before naming the
public members of the board, who were supposed to balance the
influence of the government officials.
   Brady said the appointments were slow because the administration
was looking for people experienced in real estate disposal. That
complicated clearance checks for possible conflicts of interest, he
said.

<HEAD>No Lodging Deduction When Doctor's Care Not at Hand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lodging expenses for health-related travel are
tax-deductible only if they are needed to obtain a physician's
care, the U.S. Tax Court has ruled.
   Merely traveling on a doctor's recommendation to a more
favorable climate to alleviate a specific ailment is not enough to
justify a deduction, the court held. Instead, the travel must be
essential to care provided by a doctor in a hospital or similar
facility.
   The ruling earlier this week was the first time the court had
considered a 1984 law that in certain situations allows lodging
costs to be included in deductible medical expenses.
   The court case involved Earlene Polyak of Trenton, Mich., who
suffered from chronic heart, artery and lung problems. Following
her doctors' advice, she began spending winters in Florida, living
in a travel trailer while her husband stayed at their home in
Michigan.
   Her physicians did not refer Mrs. Polyak to any doctors in
Florida, and she visited a doctor only twice during her five months
there.
   She and her husband claimed a medical deduction for $1,426 they
spent to rent a campground lot for the trailer but were turned down
by the Internal Revenue Service.
   The new law was written to benefit people who must travel away
from home because specialized care is not available locally or, in
the case of some chemotherapy treatment for cancer, for example,
may be obtained on an outpatient basis at a considerably lower cost.

<HEAD>Hong Kong to Send Vietnamese Refugees To Philippine Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hong Kong will move a group of Vietnamese boat
people to a holding center in the Philippines to help ease
congestion at camps in the British colony, a government official
said today.
   Britain and the Philippines agreed on the relocating the
Vietnamese under an international plan financed by Britain and
other countries, said Mike Hanson, Hong Kong refugee coordinator.
He said Britain has pledged $4.87 million to the plan.
   ``We hope the first small group can go by the end of this
month,'' Hanson said.
   The plan is a new effort to relieve congestion in the squalid
refugee camps in the British colony, where clashes have broken out
with authorities and between rival groups of Vietnamese.
   In December, Hong Kong forcibly returned 51 Vietnamese to their
Communist homeland under a plan that provoked sharp criticism from
the United States and human rights organizations. The program was
then put on hold.
   The Philippine camp at Morong, about 50 miles west of Manila, is
operated by the U.N. High Commission for Refugees for Vietnamese
for boat people who have been classified as refugees and have been
accepted for resettlement in third countries.
   There are about 55,000 Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong, and
authorities fear their numbers will increase this summer when
Vietnamese have normally fled their Communist homeland for other
countries.
   Of the Vietnamese in Hong Kong, about 44,000 arrived after June
1988, when Hong Kong began to classify arriving boat people as
illegal immigrants unless they can prove they face political
persecution in Vietnam.
   Those classified as illegal immigrants can be repatriated back
to Vietnam.
   The remaining 11,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong arrived either
before the cutoff date or have classified as genuine refugees
entitled to resettlement in other countries.
   A Hong Kong government spokeswomen said refugees at the camp in
the Philippines will be given vocational and language training to
help them settle in their new countries.

   The 1989-90 flu season could turn out to be the
worst in five years, the national Centers for Disease Control says.
   And the dominant strain is one that hits especially hard against
older people, who probably are not vaccinated, according to a CDC
report Thursday.
   The CDC said the winter flu season has been marked by a flu type
especially troublesome for older people: the type researchers know
as A-H3N2.
   In the average influenza season, the flu kills about 20,000
Americans. But in 1984-85, the last year in which A-H3N2 was so
predominant, about 57,000 people died.
   ``This year looks to me like the worst year since '84-85,'' said
Dr. Walter Gunn, a CDC flu specialist.
   The U.S. flu season, which peaked in late January and early
February, featured almost exclusively a Type A-H3N2 flu strain
dubbed the ``Shanghai flu'' _ one of three components in the
current flu vaccine, recommended for people older than 65 or
patients with ailments such as diabetes or kidney disease.
   The recommended flu vaccine is up to 75 percent effective in
preventing complications and death from flu in older people, the
CDC said in its weekly report.
   But a survey of Medicare beneficiaries found that only 43
percent had received flu vaccinations for the 1988-89 winter flu
season, the CDC reported Thursday. Nine out of 10 who weren't
vaccinated fell into the older-or-ill group for whom shots are
recommended.
   ``We still have quite a ways to go'' in immunizing Americans
against influenza, said the CDC's Dr. Mary Ann Sprauer.
   The most commonly cited reason for not being vaccinated: 54
percent ``considered themselves healthy and not in need of
vaccination,'' the Atlanta-based agency reported.
   Thirty percent cited concerns about side effects from the
vaccine, and 30 percent were concerned about illness associated
with the shots.
   The CDC stressed that the Medicare survey is not a
representative national sample and may not reflect the nation's
older population.
   But the findings among Medicare participants were somewhat more
encouraging than previous surveys showing the vaccination rate
among people over 65 to be 23 to 32 percent.
   ``We took a little heart in the fact that it seemed to be a
little higher,'' Sprauer said. ``But the national goal, for the
nation in 1990, was 60 percent (among those recommended for the
vaccine). We'd like to see it up there around 60 or 70 percent, if
not higher.''

   High school seniors won't have to take the
dreaded final exams this year, all because they got an A for effort
in combating cuts in the state's education budget.
   At the student council's request, the school committee voted
Wednesday to exempt the Class of 1990 from the annual year-end
tests.
   Committee members said the seniors have proven their academic
mettle by combating budget cuts and fighting for funds during a
rally this week at the Statehouse.
   ``Children have to worry about things we never had to worry
about when we were students,'' committee member Nancy Rubenstein
said. ``They have to worry about fighting for education.
   ``They deserve it.''
   Not everyone agreed.
   ``I recognize that this is an outstanding class, but I think
this would be one more example of weakening academics,''
Superintendent John Maloney said.
   As for the students, they were ``totally shocked'' that the
committee agreed to their proposal.
   Said class president Susan Slater: ``I can't wait to tell the
kids at school.''

   Stormie Jones, the world's first and longest
surviving recipient of a heart-liver transplant, was cleared to go
home after nearly a month of hospital care, her mother said.
   ``She's doing fine. She had her last checkup today,'' Susie
Purcell said Thursday from a Ronald McDonald House near Children's
Hospital, where 12-year-old Stormie was operated on twice in two
days.
   Stormie and her mother, who live in the Fort Worth, Texas,
suburb of White Settlement, were scheduled to return home today.
   Stormie arrived in Pittsburgh Feb. 19, nearly six years to the
day after her historic first transplant.
   Ten hours of surgery were needed Feb. 20 to replace Stormie's
first donor liver, which was damaged by hepatitis caused by an
unknown virus.
   Doctors operated for nine hours the next day to stop internal
bleeding.
   Stormie's donor heart has remained healthy, doctors said.
   The girl's first transplant, on Valentine's Day 1984, was needed
because a disease left her with cholesterol levels 10 times greater
than normal.

<HEAD>Two Mutiny Leaders Escape From Military Hospital</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two officers who took part in
December's coup attempt escaped from a military hospital where they
were recuperating from wounds suffered during the mutiny, a
military spokesman said today.
   Authorities learned about the escape early today after the two
officers were unaccounted for during a roll call of patients at the
V. Luna General Hospital, said Lt. Col. Renato Maligaya.
   Marine Capt. Ariel Querubin and Army 1st Lt. Gener del Rosario
may have escaped during the night, the spokesman said.
   Maligaya said the two suffered gunshot wounds during fighting at
the suburban Camp Aguinaldo military headquarters during the Dec.
1-9 attempt to topple President Corazon Aquino. The fighting left
113 people dead.
   A search for the escapees was under way, Maligaya said.
   On Thursday, intelligence agents captured an army explosives
expert who admitted participating in the December failed coup
against President Corazon Aquino.
   Maj. Wilhelm Doromal, a former explosives instructor at the
Philippine Military Academy, said in a television interview that he
joined the coup attempt because of alleged army corrpution.
   More than 1,900 renegade soldiers and officers have been taken
into custody since the December coup attempt.

   Tales of ghosts may have scared a Wall Street
bond trader out of a deal for an 18-rVictorian house, but they
can't get him his down payment back, a judge has ruled.
   State Supreme Court Justce Edward Lehner said Thursday that
63-year-old Helen Ackley was under no legal obligation to tmbovsky,
37, about the ghosts she believes go bump in the night in her home.
   ``It is clearin New York the doctrine of caveat emptor (let the
buyer beware) still holds sway in real estate transactions,''
Lehner said.
   Stambovsky, who contends the ghost stories harmed the house's
property valw things differently.
   ``We were victims of smic fraud,'' Stambovsky said.
   Lehner ruledt Stambovsky, in trying to get out of a $650,000s
contract, was in default and not entitled to trn of his $32,500
down payment.
   Stambovskye and his then pregnant wife, Patrice Soriero, he
house at first but became nervous about shariome with ghosts.
   Ackley said she told the buyers about the ghosts, but they
laughed it ofmbovsky's lawyers, William Stein, said no mentiade of
the ghosts until after the contract was signed in August 1989 for
the home in Nyack, a town about 20 miles north of New York City.
   Ackley said the ghosts are a young Revolutionary-era naval
lieutenant in his early 20s, a young woman about the same age, and
a man in his 60s.
   She wrote about them in the May 1977 Reader's Digest in an
article titled ``Our Hauntede on the Hudson.''
   The ghosts can be heard g down the stairs in the morning and
going backe evening, Ackley said.
   She said that when her four grown cn were young, the ghosts
would up in the morning.
   That's all well and good, but what if the ghosts only like the
Ackley family, Soriero said.
   ``They might not like it if she moves,'' she said.
   Once she sells the house, Ackley said, she plans to move to
Orlando. She noted that ghosts usually get attached either to a
particular person or a specificplace and she doesn't know what kind
of ghosts she has.
   ``If they want to come with me, I'd be glad to hav them,'' she
said.

<HEAD>$8 Billion Atom Smasher Gets Government Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has given final approval
to the $8 billion atom-smasher expected to shed new light on the
sub-atomic particles that are the universe's fundamental building
blocks.
   The Energy Department on Thursday approved the siting of the
54-mile ring, W. Henson Moore, deputy secretary of energy, told a
gathering of more than 600 representatives from government,
industry and science who will build the superconducting super
collider.
   The announcement allows Texas to begin a land-buying binge
outside of Dallas with some of the $1 billion it pledged in a
successful effort to lure the project, and enables scientists to
begin planning construction that could take a decade.
   ``Start your engines and start your land buying,'' Moore said.
   The Bush administration decided to support changes that would
make the super collider more effective and more expensive, bringing
the price tag up from the original estimate of $5.9 billion.
   ``The unanimous position was to go with the best science,''
Moore said.
   Morton Meyerson, head of the Texas National Research Laboratory
Commission, said his agency, armed with a $250 million bond issue,
is ready to move now that the site plan finally has been approved.
   ``The big flag goes down,'' Meyerson said. ``Now we begin land
acquisition, and that's the toughest, hardest most intense project
we have _ the one that will affect the most people.''
   Hundreds of individual land purchases will have to be negotiated
in rural Ellis County outside of Dallas, he said.
   The ring will be built underground and is intended by its
backers to be the world's premier high-energy physics laboratory.
   It will hurl streams of protons, guided by powerful
electromagnets, through the ring at almost the speed of light until
they smash together and break up into even smaller particles.
   Critics of the super collider have complained it will absorb too
much of the nation's scientific funding.
   Backers say it will increase interest in science.
   John Toll, president of the 77-university association contracted
by the U.S. government to operate the super collider, said the
knowledge generated by the super collider will be shared with
schools and industries around the world.
   He also said the project's mammoth size has already aroused
curiosity that he hopes will lead more students into scientific
careers.
   The project is expected to spend $370 million annually when
completed. It will create 2,500 permanent jobs and 4,500 temporary
construction jobs.
   Congress approved $225 million in the current fiscal year for
startup costs, and the Bush administration _ which has indicated it
will spend up to $8 billion on the super collider _ is asking for
$318 million for the upcoming year.

<HEAD>Doctors Fail to Recommend Breast X-Rays Often Enough, Specialists
Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Almost one-third of the 44,000 women expected
to die of breast cancer this year could be saved if more doctors
urged their patients to have mammograms, a cancer specialist says.
   ``The whole point of mammography is you can find the breast
cancer two years before you can feel it,'' Cori Vanchieri, director
of the National Cancer Institute's early detection education
program, said Thursday.
   ``Scientists say if women got mammograms as often as they
should, we would see a 30 percent reduction in the (breast cancer)
death rate,'' she said.
   Only 19 percent of U.S. women are regularly screened for breast
cancer, said Dr. Sandra Swain of the Lombardi Cancer Center at
Georgetown University.
   The cancer specialists were in New Orleans for the American
College of Radiology's 24th National Conference on Breast Cancer,
where findings from numerous studies on breast cancer are being
presented this week.
   Mammography _ X-ray examination of the breasts _ is a widely
accepted and often recommended method of early detection, according
to the American Cancer Society.
   The society recommends a mammogram for women between the ages of
35 and 39, mammograms combined with a physician's examination every
one or two years for women between 40 and 49, and annual mammograms
and exams for women over 50.
   But doctors are not recommending mammograms for their patients
with regularity, Ms. Vanchieri said. In 1989, 37 percent of doctors
surveyed said they were referring women for screening based on the
Cancer Society's guidelines. That's up from 11 percent in 1984 but
still inadequate, she said.
   Doctor referral seemed to be the most important factor for
getting women to have the checkups, according to a recent study,
Ms. Vanchieri said.
   ``Eighty percent said they would have gone if a doctor told them
to,'' she said.
   Early screening could improve cancer detection rates by 50
percent, said Dr. Daniel Kopans, an associate professor of
radiology at Harvard University and director of breast imaging at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   ``Doctors to a certain extent are at fault for not recommending
screening,'' he said.
   They give a number of reasons for not recommending X-ray
screening, including cost, dispute over the beginning age and
frequency for testing, and a lack of information, Kopans said.
   ``Believe it or not, a lot of physicians are just not aware of
the value of mammography,'' Kopans said.
   A mammogram costs about $100, but screening is not covered by
all insurance companies, Ms. Vanchieri said. Twenty-six states have
laws requiring insurance coverage for such checkups, she said.
   ``The big issue for them (doctors) is whether patients can
afford it,'' Ms. Vanchieri said. ``But women say cost is not a
primary concern for them.''
   Medical groups are working with radiologists and insurance
companies to increase coverage and reduce expenses, Ms. Vanchieri
said.

<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter today said
chances seem better than ever for the release of foreign hostages
in Lebanon and that President Hafez Assad repeated vows to help win
their freedom.
   Carter made the comments to a news conference in the Syrian
capital on the fifth anniversary of the kidnapping in west Beirut
of American reporter Terry Anderson, the longest-held of the 18
Westerners missing in Lebanon.
   ``My own conviction is that more opportunities exist now for his
release than ever before,'' Carter said.
   He spoke shortly before he left Syria for Jordan, the third leg
of a tour that carried him earlier to Egypt and will later take him
to Israel.
   Carter said he did not know if there were any secret U.S.
dealings on the matter, but noted ``there are statements being made
from Tehran that to me are encouraging.
   ``I think now there's a growing desire on the part of the
Iranian government and the U.S. government to work out the problems
between us,'' he said. ``There's no doubt that Iran has influence
on those holding the hostages, although not complete control.''
   Recent newspaper articles in Iran had suggested the hostages
should be freed. Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide
of Lebanon's Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a sermon last
month that a humanitarian means of freeing the hostages must be
found.
   Carter said the Saudi Arabian-brokered Taif accords for peace in
Lebanon were ``a very constructive factor in the release of the
hostaeveral powerful factions in Lebanon.
   ``When it's no longer necessary for Lebanon to be fragmented,
with different militia groups jealously guarding their weapons and
their prerogatives, then I think it's very likely the hostages will
be released,'' Carter said.
   The tour, sponsored by the Cater Center of Emory University in
Atlanta, is his fourth visit to the region since he left office in
1981.
   Carter said he discussed the hostage issue during a meeting of
several hours with Assad on Thursday.
   He said Assad and other Syrian officials ``are using their good
offices, they have assured me, in every way possible to both locate
the hostages and convince those who might be holding them they
should be protected and released.''
   Although Syria has about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate, it has little influence with the
Iranian-allied groups believed to be holding the hostages.
   Carter said he supported the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate
freely to Israel, a position at odds with that of Syria, but said
he agreed with President Bush that they should note allowed to
settle in the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights or east
Jerusalem, territories captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEAD>Cabinet Resigns To Give Roh Free Hand To Reorganize Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Cabinet resigned today to give
President Roh Tae-woo a free hand to reorganize the government
following the merger of his party with two of the three main
opposition groups.
   Government officials said Roh is expected to announce a new
Cabinet on Saturday after consultations with his two fellow
governing party leaders _ Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil.
   A Cabinet change has long been anticipated after Roh merged his
governing party with two centrist opposition groups, led by the two
Kims, to form a giant conservative party last month.
   Government officials have indicated a sweeping Cabinet change
would be needed to inject ``fresh air'' into national politics
following the merger.
   They had said a change could be made after the National Assembly
ended a special session today.
   Local newspapers, quoting unidentified government sources,
reported the reorganization would probably affect nearly two-thirds
of the 22-member Cabinet.
   The national news agency, Yonhap, said with up to 18 posts
likely to be affected, the change would be the largest since Roh
took office in the spring of 1988. The previous shakeup in December
1988 affected 16 posts.
   Almost all newspapers reported Roh would retain Kang Young-hoon
as prime minister but replace Deputy Premier-Economic Planning
Minister Cho Soon and most of other economic members.
   Cho and his economic team have been criticized for a series of
policy failures that aggravated land speculation, increased
inflation and slowed exports.
   Exports in the first two months of this year decreased 2.5
percent to $8.7 billion from a year ago.
   Roh, a former army general, was elected president in December
1987 following a split of two opposition parties. He replaced Chun
Doo-hwan, who called the vote following mass demonstrations to
demand democratic reforms and an end to autocratic rule.

<HEAD>Researchers: Rare Blood Disorder May Not Be Due to Contamination</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare blood disorder linked to the recalled
dietary supplement L-tryptophan may be due to a natural chemical
breakdown in the body rather than contamination, researchers said.
   The over-the-counter health-food supplement used to treat
sleeplessness, depression and other problems was pulled from store
shelves last year after hundreds of people using it fell ill of
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.
   No contaminant has been found, and natural chemical processes in
the body during the breakdown of L-tryptophan could be behind the
painful blood disorder, said the researchers at Georgetown
University Medical Center.
   ``Arguing against the contamination theory is that in spite of
the fact that people have been searching (for the contaminant), it
hasn't been identified,'' said Dr. Paul Katz, chief rheumatologist
at Georgetown.
   ``Also, the L-tryptophan implicated has been traced to three
different manufacturers,'' he said Thursday from Washington. ``That
argues a little bit against there being a common-source
contaminant.''
   L-tryptophan is an amino acid _ a building block of protein _
found in many foods.
   Fourteen people who took L-tryptophan have died in recent months
and more than 1,200 others have fallen ill with
eosinophilia-myalgia, which in milder cases causes aches, rashes
and fever.
   A study of the problem by the Georgetown researchers was
published in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Katz and his colleagues believe L-tryptophan supplements under
certain conditions contribute to a build-up of serotonin, a
naturally occurring substance that helps nerves communicate with
each other in the brain.
   Abnormally high levels of serotonin have been shown or suggested
as factors in disorders similar to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome,
the researchers said. Serotonin is a byproduct of the breakdown of
L-tryptophan.
   Katz said: ``When you get away from the contamination theory,
which is still the leading theory, people who develop this
(syndrome) may have some intrinsic abnormality of L-tryptophan
metabolism.''
   The blood disorder may have occurred often in the past and
diagnosed as something else, Katz said.
   ``The number of people who have gotten this (syndrome) is
relatively small compared to the number of people who take it
(L-tryptophan),'' Katz said, adding he could not estimate how many
people have taken L-tryptophan supplements sold for years over the
counter.
   The Food and Drug Administration on Nov. 17 requested a
voluntary recall of L-tryptophan supplements and five days later
extended the recall to include a ban on imports.
   FDA spokesman Chris Lecos said Thurday that federal researchers
have analyzed hundreds of L-tryptophan samples, including some from
people who fell ill, and ``have failed to identify a specific
chemical or microbial contaminant responsible for the outbreak.''
   He added, however, that the research didn't change the agency's
advice against taking L-tryptophan.

   Branson, principal of Anthony Wayne Elementary School in this

   But the kids had another idea.
   We'll read the books, they said, if you dress as a woman and sit

   The students ended up reading 6,669 books, so Branson put on a
dress Thursday and moved his telephone to the roof of a one-story
wing of the school.
   Sporting a shoulder-length brown wig, a straw hat, and a red
dress over ``a 38B cup stuffed bra,'' Branson spent all day at the
makeshift post.
   ``All during the week, they were just reading like you wouldn't

   NBC, heading for its fifth consecutive season as
first in the prime-time ratings, is considering a new comedy series
featuring rap singer Fresh Prince and a show based on the satirical
magazine Spy.
   ``We're number one and we intend to stay there,'' NBC

to whip up advertisers' enthusiasm for potential projects.
   CBS and ABC held similar sessions Wednesday.
   NBC's list of prime-time hopefuls, some of which will get a
spring and summer tryout, include a Quincy Jones comedy series with
the rap-music star, a comedy based on the ``Archie'' comic strip
and a new version of the gothic soap opera ``Dark Shadows.''
   Also on the list of prospects are two comedy specials. One,
``The Jackie Bison Show,'' would be a cartoon spoof of show
business and star the first bison ever to host its own TV show.
   The other, a TV version of the satirical magazine Spy, will get
its first on-air shot April 18. The theme will be ``How to Be
Famous.''
   Tartikoff, who spoke to advertising representatives at NBC
offices in Burbank, told reporters afterward he thought that two of
NBC's top money-earners, Bill Cosby and Johnny Carson, would be
back next season.
   The Burbank meeting was shown at NBC offices in New York on a
closed-circuit line.
   NBC is renegotiating a contract that would return the hit ``The
Cosby Show'' for a seventh season, Tartikoff said. He didn't
elaborate on what the renegotiations involved.
   Talks also are under way with Carson, host of the ``Tonight''
show since October 1962. ``We fully expect that Johnny will be
back,'' Tartikoff said.
   NBC, which earlier renewed ``Dear John,'' said it was renewing
five other series _ ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' ``Empty Nest,''
``Midnight Caller,'' ``Quantum Leap'' and ``In the Heat of the
Night.''
   In earlier presentations in Los Angeles, third-place CBS said it
had 23 series pilots under consideration, while ABC's roster of
hopefuls showed 13 comedies, 15 hourlong dramas and two half-hour
dramas.
   Under consideration at NBC are 13 dramas, 17 comedies and nine
miniseries.
   The CBS comedy pilots include ``Sunday Dinner'' from producer
Norman Lear, whose sometimes controversial sitcoms were mainstays
of CBS in the 1970s, and ``Steel Magnolias,'' a small-screen
version of the hit movie of the same name.
   ABC's possible series include Stephen Bochco's one-hour ``Cop
Rock,'' which juxtaposes music and crime-fighting, and a sitcom,
``Dr. Ruth's House,'' starring the veteran dispenser of sex advice,
Dr. Ruth Westheimer.

<HEAD>Blizzard in Minnesota, North Dakota</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While much of the East enjoyed more balmy weather today, parts
of Minnesota and North Dakota shoveled out from a blizzard that hit
overnight.
   Low pressure in northern Minnesota produced snow and strong
gusty winds across much of the northern Plains region and the Upper
Mississippi Valley Thursday night and this morning.
   Snowfall totals in northwestern Minnesota were up to 9 inches at
Detroit Lakes on Thursday. Fargo, N.D., also reported 9 inches of
new snow. At least 88 schools canceled classes today in Minnesota.
   Strong gusty winds plagued both states and parts of Colorado,
creating hazardous driving conditions. Winds gusted to 62 mph at
Chadron, Neb.
   Winds gusted to nearly 60 mph across Illinois on Thursday,
cutting off electricity to thousands of homes, delaying traffic at
Chicago's O'Hare Airport and killing one person.
   Eddie Reese, 30, of Chicago was killed after he was hit by part
of the roof of the Christmas card factory where he worked.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed in the central Gulf Coast
states Thursday, spawning at least three tornadoes. In the southern
Mississippi town of Benndale, a twister damaged two mobile homes,
injuring three people.
   In southwest Alabama, a tornado accompanied by heavy rains
flipped two mobile homes and blew the roof off a house. No injuries
were reported.
   In the six hours ending at 6 p.m., Mobile, Ala., was drenched
with nearly 4 inches of rain.
   Flash flood watches were in effect today for northwestern
Georgia, northern and western Alabama, middle and eastern Tennessee
and parts of northwest Florida.
   Cooler air moved into the East early today, but temperatures
were still expected to be in the 50s and 60s over much of the
region.
   On Thursday, the heat wave broke records for the fourth
consecutive day in some areas. Temperatures were in the 70s and 80s
eastward from the Mississippi River.
   At least 47 cities reported new record high temperatures for the
date, with some cities reporting their warmest readings on record
for so early in the season.
   In Harrisburg, Pa., the high of 82 degrees marked the first time
in more than 100 years of records that there had been four straight
days of 80 degree weather in March.
   Other records: 84 degrees at Baltimore; 72 at Burlington, Vt.;
80 at Cleveland; 77 at New York City; 81 at Philadelphia; and 81 at
Washington, D.C.
   Readings warmed into the 60s along the Pacific Coast and into
the 70s and 80s in the Southwest deserts.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 89 degrees at Fort Myers,
Fla.

post. No pickup.</NOTE>

   Hard-liners today launched efforts to overthrow
caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir as leader of the right-wing
Likud bloc after a parliamentary no-confidence vote toppled his
governing coalition.
   The Yediot Ahronot daily said Shamir was considering retirement
from political life following Thursday's defeat. Another newspaper,
Maariv, quoted the premier as saying ``I see no reason to resign.''
   Israel radio said Likud leaders met in Shamir's office this
morning for a discussion of the party's future.
   Sahi Alnegbi, a Likud member of parliament, said on Israel
radio: ``Mr. Shamir will have to resign eventually because he
cannot form a narrow government.''
   ``When the time comes, he will have to realize he has to pass
the leadership to someone else.''
   He said the likely candidates to succeed Shamir are former Trade
Minister Ariel Sharon, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens and David Levy,
the housing minister and deputy prime minister.
   Senior Shamir aides were not immediately available for comment.
   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, meanwhile, launched contacts to
form a new government, hoping to cash in on the support from a
swing religious party that yielded the 60-55 victory against Shamir.
   It was the first time an Israeli premier was formally ousted by
a no-confidence motion. Past prime ministers have resigned before a
vote was held when they appeared sure of losing.
   Shamir remains caretaker prime minister until a new government
is formed, a process that could take months.
   The dispute that brought down Shamir's government centered on
U.S. proposals for Middle East peace that included involving east
Jerusalem Arabs and Palestinians deported by Israel in peace talks.
   Labor supported the moves, but Likud objected that including
east Jerusalem Arabs could call into question Israel's control of
Jerusalem and deportees could indirectly involve the Palestine
Liberation Organization in the process.
   Peres, a left-of-center politician and former premier, appeared
to have the best chances of being asked to form a new government,
Israeli reports said today.
   But the complexities of reconciling demands of the religious
parties and his allies in left-wing factions could force Labor and
Likud reluctantly into a broad-based government or bring about
early national elections.
   According to Maariv and the Hadashot daily, Peres has offered
the utra-Orthodox Shas Party the important Finance Ministry in a
new government. Five of six Shas leaders helped Labor Thursday by
being absent from voting.
   Another would-be Labor ally is the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel
faction, which voted against Likud. Hadashot said this party may be
assigned the Housing and Welfare ministries.
   The two religious parties hold a critical 11 seats in the
120-member Parliament, which when added to 15 held by Arab and
left-wing factions, would give the 39-member Labor a majority of 65.
   Likud holds 40 seats. The threatened end of its 13-year
dominance in government touched off new infighting in the fractious
party, with supporters of Levy urging the removal of the
74-year-old Shamir as party chairman.
   ``The reality shows that as long as we don't unite around one
person it will be fateful for Likud,'' Levy supporter and
legislator Reuven Rivlin said on the radio. ``Today we have to
unite around one person who can lead us to forming a government.''
   Rivlin said Levy supporters met Thursday night after the vote
but no decisions were made. Levy has been an ally of Sharon, the
retired general who quit in February to protest the government's
peace policies.
   Shamir supporter and Minister of Arab Affairs Ehud Olmert also
hinted there was talk of Shamir stepping down.
   ``What is in the realm of the possible is difficult to
predict,''Olmert said. ``Concerning Yitzhak Shamir, I think that's
something he must decide and I think we will speak about it in the
next couple of days.''
   Peres told reporters he was confident Labor would lead the next
government and would move toward peace.
   Palestinians have waged a 27-month-old uprising against Israeli
rule of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 663
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians in
the revolt. Forty-three Israelis also have been slain.

   Jail officials cannot deny a female inmate
visits with her lesbian lover merely because of her homosexuality,
a federal judge ruled.
   The ruling from U.S. District Judge D. Brooks Smith came on a
lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of
the prisoner, identified only as ``Jane Doe.''
   The woman, in Blair County Prison since May, claimed she was
denied visits with her lover even though jailhouse visits were
permitted between heterosexual inmates and their spouses and lovers.
   Smith ruled Wednesday that the ban was unconstitutional. He
cited a 1980 Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that the state
cannot control the conduct of consenting adults in private, Marion
Damick, a spokeswoman for the ACLU's Pittsburgh chapter, said
Thursday.
   All visits at the jail in Hollidaysburg take place in a room
where prisoners and guests are separated by windows.
   The lawsuit named Warden Gary Sparks and the Blair County Prison
Board as co-defendants. During testimony before Smith in December,
Sparks defended the decision to prohibit the visits, saying a
prisoner identified as a homosexual could become the target of
assaults and abuse by other inmates.
   If the prison board files an appeal, visits between the inmate
and her lover would not be permitted until an appeals court rules.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Rebels Claim 13,000 Government Casualties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas in northern Ethiopia say they
have killed, wounded or captured more than 13,000 government troops
_ half of them since Sunday _ and damaged several aircraft and
tanks during an offensive.
   It was impossible to independently verify Thursday's rebel
claims, and the government rarely comments on such assertions.
   The Eritrean People's Liberation Front said in a clandestine
radio broadcast that 6,500 of the casualties were inflicted between
Sunday and Wednesday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Kenya's capital, said this week's
fighting occurred southeast of Asmara, capital of Ethiopia's
northernmost province, Eritrea.
   ``In earlier engagements in the past two weeks in different
parts of the same front, 7,000 Dergue (government) soldiers have
been put out of action and the Dergue has lost three burnt fighter
planes, eight tanks and four anti-aircraft carrier vehicles,'' the
broadcast said.
   The broadcast did not specify the type of aircraft destroyed,
but Ethiopia's air force flies Soviet-made MiG-17s, 21s, and 23s.
   ``In the last 20 days the Dergue has lost more than 13,500
soldiers as dead, wounded and aptured,'' the broadcast said.
   The rebels, who have fought 28 years for independence for the
former Italian colony of Eritrea, launched their current offensive
last month, ending a de facto cease-fire.
   The Eritreans claim to have captured Ethiopia's only deep water
Red Sea port, Massawa, and cut the road from the harbor to Asmara.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's government has not
acknowledged that claim, but admits the port has been closed by
fighting it says continues in and around the city. It has
acknowledged many casualties but has not given a figure.
   The government is also fighting a second but smaller force, the
Tigre People's Liberation Front. The Tigreans have been fighting
for 14 yeears and virtually control Eritrea's southern neighbor,
Tigre province.
   The Tigreans seek Mengistu's ouster and the establishment of a
government patterned after that of Albania, the last hard-line
Marxist state in Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Officials Caution Against Dangerous Elevator Game</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dangerous game called ``elevator
surfing,'' blamed in the death of a college freshman, has been a
problem for years in high-rise buildings, officials say.
   Also called ``elevator action'' or ``piloting an elevator,'' the
hazardous sport involves climbing atop elevator cars _ either
through trapdoors in the roof or by jamming doors open _ and riding
on the roofs.
   ``We've taken it terribly seriously. We've been fighting it for
a long time,'' said Val Coleman, public information director for
the New York City Housing Authority.
   Coleman worked on a recently released cautionary videotape on
the issue called ``Children are Too Young to Die.'' There have been
10 deaths and more than 50 injuries reported in New York during the
past five years, he said.
   At the Otis Elevator Co., the largest elevator manufacturer in
the United States, officials have been concerned about the
dangerous game for some time, said Michael Jordan-Reilly, spokesman
for the Hartford, Conn.-based company.
   ``This is one of our major concerns,'' he said.
   Susan Beckett, a student at the University of Massachusetts,
told the campus newspaper, The Collegian, that students ride atop
elevators ``usually on the weekends when people are drunk.''
   At Ms. Beckett's school, 18-year-old Joel Mangion of Newton was
found dead Sunday at the bottom of an elevator shaft. Friends said
he had been jumping from one car to another in the double shaft.
   About a year ago, a student suffered serious injuries after
falling 30 feet in an elevator shaft, university officials said. In
the early 1970s, a student died after riding in a chair tied to the
bottom of an elevator car.
   Joseph Zannini, executive director of housing at the university,
said he has heard of the game occasionally during his 25 years in
college administration.
   ``There's so many unfortunate ways that young people sometimes
lose their lives because they just don't think,'' he said.
   Jordan-Reilly said the problem has probably existed ``as long as
there have been elevators and as long as there have been people who
want to try something dangerous.''
   In Bridgeport, Conn., police and firefighters spent two tense
hours in January rescuing a 13-year-old girl who was wedged between
an elevator car and the shaft after she slipped and fell off the
roof of the car in a public housing shelter. Police said the girl
and her sister were playing on top of the elevator.
   Donald A. Robinson, director of environmental health and safety
for the Massachusetts school, said officials are looking for new
ways to discourage elevator surfing.
   ``The message needs to be made very clear how elevators should
be used and not misused and to really emphasize the obvious
significant consequences,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle returned to
Washington today after spending a week in South America, where he
proclaimed the ``revolution of democracy has won'' in the
hemisphere.
   Quayle on Thursday said the inaugural speech by the new
Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, marked ``a fitting
cap'' to the trip, during which he daily sang the praises of
democracy.
   The vice president said Collor proclaimed that his ``first
unswerving commitment as president of Brazil will be to democracy.''
   Noting that elected governments now exist through all of South
America, he said ``the revolution of democracy has won.''
   Quayle today was reporting to President Bush on his trip. He
also scheduled a meeting with representatives of the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels, following his series of contacts with outgoing
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega during his trip.
   Quayle said he would talk to the Contra leaders ``about a way to
advance peace,'' including the U.S. proposal to have the rebels
move temporarily into enclaves in Nicaragua under the supervision
of United Nations peacekeeping troops.
   ``They'll certainly know that I think it's time that they stop
fighting,'' the vice president said.
   Quayle said Thursday that Ortega ``can do a lot'' to change
activities that the Bush administration contends portend trouble
for a peaceful transfer of power on April 25.
   Asked what concerns he expressed to Ortega during their
10-minute chat in Brasilia on Wednesday, Quayle said he did not
want to ``get into a public debate on a lot of specifics.''
   But he said that disarmament of Ortega's Sandinista militia is
as important as disarming the Contras. How to demobilize the rebels
has been a principal topic of negotiations leading to the
inauguration of incoming president Violeta Chamorro.
   ``There are reports that many arms are being shipped out to the
Sandinistas that are taking them to their homes and taking them to
the hills ready to fight again at another time,'' Quayle said at a
news conference before leaving Brazil.
   ``That would be a most unfortunate development in the
transition. Daniel Ortega can do a lot to stop that.''
   U.S. officials also claim the leftist Sandinistas are depleting
Nicaragua's treasury before leaving power and turning over houses
to Sandinista militants.
   Quayle and Ortega had met earlier in the week in Chile for two
quick chats and a 90-minute lunch. Ortega promised a peaceful
transfer of power.
   The two were among foreign leaders attending presidential
inaugurations in Chile last Sunday and Brazil on Thursday.
   At Thursday's inauguration, several of the key regional players
trying to bring peace to Nicaragua chatted before the ceremony.
   Costa Rican President Oscar Arias was seated next to Ortega.
They talked at length to Venezuela President Carlos Andres Perez
and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, as well as to
Argentinian President Carlos Menem, Peru's Alan Garcia and Rodrigo
Borja of Bolivia.
   Quayle did not talk with them, entering the crowded hall shortly
behind Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Castro was surrounded by a clot of people pressing in to greet
him. Quayle had to edge past the group to get to his front-row
seat. He later took the opportunity to again criticize Castro as
being isolated in a hemisphere of elected governments.
   ``Only one Latin leader came (to the inauguration) in a military
uniform,'' Quayle told reporters. ``The rest of the Latin American
leaders were there because the people voted for them.''

<HEAD>Energy Department Wires Residents' Health Monitoring Payment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neighbors of a government uranium processing
plant who sued the Energy Department over fears of radioactive
contamination received $16 million of a $78 million court
settlement for medical monitoring.
   The federal agency wired the long-awaited payment Thursday to
Central Trust Co., a Cincinnati bank.
   Neighbors of the Feed Materials Production Plant, about 18 miles
northwest of Cincinnati, filed a $300 million lawsuit in 1985
against the plant's former operator, National Lead of Ohio Inc.,
and its parent company, NL Industries.
   The Energy Department, as the Fernald plant's owner and contract
employer of National Lead, negotiated a settlement approved last
September by U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel.
   The Energy Department was to have paid the full $78 million by
last Oct. 15 but didn't, saying there was confusion over which of
its budget accounts was to be used to provide the money.
   The residents went back to Spiegel and obtained an order to
compel payment. The judge had certified the lawsuit as a
class-action on behalf of 14,000 people living within five miles of
the plant.
   The Energy Department agreed to provide a second installment of
$20.5 million by the end of this year, said Stanley M. Chesley, a
lawyer for the neighbors. The agency agreed to pay off the balance
of the settlement, with interest, by the end of 1991, he said.
   ``This is a true first in American history,'' Chesley said.
``We're finally going to get the medical monitoring. The message
is, the judicial system works.''
   Uranium processing for the government's nuclear weapons program
was halted last July at the 39-year-old plant.
   Medical tests are to start soon on neighbors who fear that
exposure to years of radioactive emissions from the plant may have
caused cancer or other ailments. Chesley said he knew of at least
1,000 requests filed by neighbors for medical monitoring, which is
to be performed under supervision of court-appointed trustees.
   ``I think history has been made here, I really do,'' said Lisa
Crawford, spokeswoman for Fernald Residents for Environmental
Safety and Health, the neighbors' organization that filed the suit.
   ``We're just pleased that we were able to stick this out and
work it through and get the settlement, even though it was five
months late,'' she said.
   The settlement is to be administered by four Cincinnati banks
and three court-appointed trustees.
   Later, trustees are to decide which of hundreds of property
claims and claims over emotional distress are to be paid.

<HEAD>Police Drag Opposition Leaders From Presidential Grounds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military police battled opposition leaders
in the gardens of the presidential compound today, broke up a
planned sit-in and dragged the politicians away.
   The officials of the Democratic Progressive Party had demanded
to see President Lee Teng-hui, but presidential aides said Lee was
in a meeting and could not meet them.
   Today's clash with police was the latest since Tuesday by
opposition supporters, who have protested a proposal to strengthen
the National Assembly. The opposition fears the assembly, dominated
by aging right-wing Chinese Nationalists who have ruled Taiwan
since 1949, will hinder democratic reforms.
   Chang Chun-hung, the opposition party's secretary-general, said
the party wanted to meet Lee because they were concerned the
assembly, Taiwan's electoral college, would pass the proposal to
meet annually to review bills passed by the Legislative Yuan.
   The assembly now meets every six years, primarily to elect
Taiwan's president. There are fears the proposed legislation will
expand the National Assembly's powers and hinder future democratic
reforms in Taiwan.
   On Thursday, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution
threatening to freeze approval of the National Assembly's budget if
the proposed legislation is passed.
   Witnesses said the opposition leaders were angered when about
100 police surrounded them and forced them to leave the
Presidential Office building through a side gate rather than the
main gate.
   ``As citizens, we only wanted to leave decently from the front
gate,'' said party chairman Huang Hsin-chien, 62.
   The opposition leaders then tried to stage a sit-in in the
Presidential Office gardens but were eventually dragged away by
police.
   The Democratic Progressive Party leaders told reporters they
were kicked and clubbed by police. Police said they were the ones
who were attacked, but neither group reported any serious injuries.
   The 752-seat National Assembly is dominated by elderly deputies,
most of them members of the governing Nationalist Party, who were
elected on the Chinese mainland before 1949 when the Nationalists
lost a civil war and fled to Taiwan.
   The aged politicians have been frozen in office to support a
Nationalist claim to be China's legitimate government. They have
rejected demands they retire.
   All 11 Democratic Progressive Party deputies in the National
Assembly have been barred from taking their seats since Tuesday for
refusing to pledge allegiance to the Republic of China, the name
under which the Nationalists founded their nation in 1911.
   They have instead pledged their allegiance to the people of
Taiwan. The Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition
group, was formed three years ago and most of its members are
native Taiwanese.
   The party claims its 11 delegates have been barred to allow the
aged lawmakers to ram through the controversial legislation and
other bills, including one that would allow the aged assemblymen to
decide on their retirement.
   The aged lawmakers also have been accused of using ``political
blackmail'' over President Lee because they dominate the National
Assembly, which will elect Taiwan's next president March 21.
   Lee, 67, is the sole candidate for the post, but he angered the
aged assemblymen earlier by rejecting their choice of Chiang Wego,
the sole surviving son of Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, to be
his running mate.
   Lee became the first native Taiwanese to head the Nationalist
government in 1988 when he was elevated from the vice presidency
following the death of President Chiang Ching-kuo.

   Britain's ambassador to Iraq returned to London
today after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher recalled him to
protest the Baghdad government's execution of a London-based
reporter accused of spying.
   While the Thatcher government stopped short of imposing economic
sanctions, opposition lawmakers called for sanctions and an arms
embargo to protest the hanging of Farzad Bazoft, 31, who Iraq said
was spying for Britain and Israel.
   Mrs. Thatcher recalled Ambassador Harold Walker and ordered the
expulsion of six Iraqi military trainees from Britain.
   Walker arrived in London this morning and said relations with
Iraq had suffered ``a terrible blow'' in the short-term but that
the long-term damage ``depends more on the Iraqis than ourselves.''
   The British government also announced a freeze on visits by
government ministers to Iraq and canceled a trade mission.
   But it did not break diplomatic relations or impose economic
sanctions on Iraq. Britain has nearly a $500 million trade surplus
with Iraq.
   Britain's expulsion order against the Iraqi military trainees
does not affect about 1,000 other Iraqi students in Britain.
   A group of opposition Labor Party lawmakers introduced a motion
in the House of Commons calling on Britain and the European
Community to impose economic sanctions and an arms embargo on Iraq
``until the respect for human rights in that country has reached an
acceptable standard.''
   Such motions allow lawmakers to go on record with an opinion. No
vote will be taken on the proposal unless it is presented as
legislation.
   Government-run newspapers in Iraq today reported that
authorities plan a mass demonstration in Baghdad on Saturday to
protest the British measures.
   ``Iraq will not bow to any form of pressure or extortion and
will pay no attention to any measures taken by British
authorities,'' one of the state-run newspapers, Al-Shaab, wrote.
   Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, also called the
hanging ``barbaric'' but today ruled out sanctions on Iraq. Western
European governments, press and human rights groups also denounced
Iraq. The United States said it regretted that pleas for clemency
had gone unheeded.
   Bazoft, an Iranian-born reporter who worked for the weekly
newspaper The Observer, was arrested while trying to check out
reports of an explosion at a Iraqi military complex. Bazoft, who
had lived in Britain since 1975, was convicted and sentenced by a
military court Saturday after a closed trial.
   Bazoft's colleagues in London insisted he was not a spy, just an
enthusiastic reporter going after a scoop.
   Arab governments kept silent on the execution. Even Jordan's
King Hussein, who joined with the Palestine Liberation Organization
in seeking clemency for Bazoft, would not condemn Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   In a development late Thursday night, the British domestic news
agency Press Association quoted unidentified British government
sources as saying Bazoft had served a jail term in Britain for
robbery.
   The report quoted the sources as saying that Bazoft was
convicted at the Crown Court at Northampton in central England in
August 1981 of robbing a savings and loan office of $760.
   He was reported to have walked into the office with a fake bomb
and threatened to blow up the building if he was not given cash.
   The news agency quoted the sources as saying that he was
sentenced to 18 months in jail, but was freed because of good
conduct after a year.
   The report quoted the sources as saying the judge at the robbery
trial recommended Bazoft should be deported from Britain, but that
the recommendation was revoked following Bazoft's appeal in which
he said his life would be in danger if he returned.

<TEXT>
   Harold Medina, a federal judge for more
than 30 years who presided over the trial of 11 Communist leaders
who conspired to overthrow the American government, has died. He
was 102.
   Medina was admitted to Pascack Valley Hospital on Monday with a
slight fever, said his grandson Standish Forde Medina Jr. He died
Wednesday in his sleep.
   Medina became a judge of the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York in 1947. Shortly after his
appointment, he presided over the raucous, nine-month trial of 11
Communists convicted of conspiring to use force to overthrow the
federal government.
   Goading defense lawyers accused Medina of favoring the
prosecution. In the end, he sentenced five defense lawyers to up to
six months in jail for contempt. The Supreme Court upheld all the
convictions in split votes, and Medina became a reluctant hero
among anti-Communists.
   In 1951, Medina moved to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
when Judge Learned Hand retired.
   Medina was assigned an antitrust case involving 17 leading
investment banking companies. The case was dismissed after 2{ years
and Medina's 420-page opinion became a textbook on investment
banking.
   Medina officially retired in 1958, but continued as a ``senior''
judge writing opinions of all kinds.
   During the 1960s and 1970s, he traveled the country speaking
about the need for free speech and a free press.
   After his actual retirement in 1980 at age 92, Medina lived at
Valley Nursing Home here after living in Westhampton, N.Y., for
many years.
   At the time of his death, Medina had the double honor of being
the oldest federal judge and the oldest alumnus of Princeton
University, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1909. He graduated
from Columbia Law School in 1912.
   Medina is survived by two sons, six grandchildren and 10
great-grandchildren. A funeral service was scheduled for Sunday at
St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Westhampton Beach, N.Y.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Burmese warlord indicted by the
United States on 10 drug trafficking charges acknowledges he
annually ships hundreds of tons of heroin to the West.
   After more than two decades in the dangerous business, Khun Sa
has an unquestioned gift for survival, and even the U.S. officials
who announced the indictments Thursday said there was little chance
he would be apprehended.
   The world's No. 1 heroin producer maintains his business in
Southeast Asia's jungles despite repeated Thai and Burmese military
strikes, clashes with rival drug armies, and rumors of fatal
illness. Estimates of the size of his private army run from 4,000
to 16,000 fighters.
   He once told a journalist that the secret of his health was
tending his garden patch, growing cabbages and carrots.
   Burma's military government said today that it would cooperate
in the international war on drugs, but Western narcotics experts in
Thailand charge that some senior Burmese officials are actively
involved in trafficking.
   Little reliable information is available on Khun Sa, who is said
to have been born in 1933 to an ethnic Chinese father and a mother
of Burma's Shan ethnic minority.
   Certainly he has been extensively involved since the 1960s in
the narcotics trade in the Golden Triangle, where the borders of
Thailand, Laos and Burma converge to form a rugged and lawless
no-man's land.
   He invited reporters to his lair in early 1987, and threatened
then to increase opium production in Shan State areas under his
control from 600 to 900 tons that year. It was suggested at the
time he was angered by a just-launched Burmese program of aerial
spraying of poppy fields with aid from the U.S. government.
   Khun Sa admitted to the reporters that there were many mobile
heroin refineries in his areas, the Bangkok Post newspaper said. It
quoted him as saying he made about $7.6 million in 1986, including
revenue from taxing traders transiting his territory to smuggle
gems, cattle and narcotics.
   But Khun Sa has largely played down the narcotics connection and
instead insisted he was fighting for greater autonomy for the
Shans, just as a dozen other insurgent groups were fighting for the
rights of other Burmese minority groups.
   ``I am a nationalist, not a trafficker,'' he told a reporter who
visited him in 1986.
   Partly because he masqueraded as a freedom fighter and partly by
links with corrupt Thai officials, Khun Sa built up his operations
and his Shan United Army at Ban Hin Taek, in the hills of Chiang
Mai province in northern Thailand bordering Burma.
   Thai forces launched a major strike that killed large numbers of
his soldiers and drove him into the jungles of Shan State in
January 1982. But he rebuilt the army in a short time and extended
his influence into new areas of the frontier.
   The Burmese government said that its troops, backed by air
strikes and artillery, overran his Shan State headquarters in May
1984.
   But by all accounts, the opium warlord remains active and news
reports have said he has set up refineries in Laos in more recent
years.
   The U.S. charges stem from the largest heroin seizure in history
_ about 2,300 pounds seized in February 1988 in Bangkok before they
were to be shipped to New York.
   Analysts said there now is little hope of ferreting him out
since the Rangoon government has little authority in Shan State.
   Western officials have charged Rangoon authorities with
profiting from the drug trade. Rangoon's commitment to fighting
drugs became more suspect after the military seized power in
September 1988, killing hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators.
The United States responded by ending aid, including the joint drug
suppression effort.

<HEAD>Martial Law Lifted in Some Areas Around Rangoon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government has lifted martial
law in 12 townships near Rangoon, the state-owned Working People's
Daily reported today.
   The restrictions were lifted Thursday in the townships, which
are in the Rangoon military command region but outside the
municipal area, the paper said.
   Authorities earlier lifted martial law in 28 townships in
northwest Burma and four townships in central Burma, saying
security had been restored there.
   The military junta imposed nationwide martial law _ including a
nighttime curfew and bans on public gatherings _ after seizing
power in a September 1988 coup and killing hundreds of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The government had promised to lift martial law everywhere
before the nation's first multiparty election in three decades, now
scheduled for May 27.
   The junta recently allowed political parties to describe their
platforms in the state-run media.
   However, authorities have barred Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the
National League for Democracy, and other opposition leaders from
running for office.
   Ms. Suu Kyi, daughter of revered national independence leader
Aung San, has been under house arrest since July.

<TEXT>
   The government said today it would not
tolerate threats against Germans living in Libya following a blaze
at a suspected chemical weapons plant there.
   The Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, said an investigation
was under way to determine whether West German intelligence agents
had anything to do with Wednesday's fire at the Rabta plant, which
suffered extensive damage.
   West Germany denied responsibility.
   Juergen Chrobog, chief spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said
he knew of no specific threats against West Germany or its
citizens, but an angry crowd gathered in front of the West Germany
Embassy in Tripoli on Thursday.
   ``We expect there will be restraint from all threats against
German citizens in Libya,'' Chrobog said.
   The United States and West Germany say the plant had begun
producing poison gas, but Libya insists the factory was making
pharmaceuticals. West Germany eventually acknowledged that West
German companies helped build the plant.
   West German's ARD television network has said its Cairo office
received a statement from a previously unknown group of Libyan
dissidents claiming responsibility for the blaze.
   ``The federal government decisively rejects the Libyan attempt
to blame the Federal Republic of Germany for the fire at Ratba,''
Chrobog said today. ``We especially denounce any attempt to rouse
up Libyans against us.''
   A day earlier, a demonstration by Libyans briefly blocked access
to the West German embassy in Tripoli. The West German Foreign
Ministry summoned a high-ranking Libyan diplomat in Bonn and
formally protested the action.
   West Germany is one of Libya's biggest trading partners.
   Another goverment official in Bonn said on condition of
anonymity that it appeared Gadhafi blamed West Germany for the fire
because of Bonn's efforts to promote an international outcry
against the plant.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher had recommended the U.N.
Security Council look into any chemical weapons production at the
Rabta plant.
   The Bonn official said Genscher also sent letters to Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and to the foreign ministers of France
and Britain pressing for international pressure to close the Rabta
plant.
   For more than 14 months, the United States has accused Libya of
using the plant to make chemical weapons, including mustard and
nerve gases. Last week, the White House said the plant was
dangerous and should be shut down. The White House refused to rule
out the possibility of military action to close it.
   Libya was accused of using chemical weapons in a war against
Chad.
   Charges by the United States that German companies helped build
the Rabta plant caused a major scandal in West Germany a little
more than a year ago. West Germany at first denied the U.S. claims,
but later acknowledged them.

   A man convicted of murdering a family of four
and carving a woman's nearly full-term fetus out of her womb should
die in Florida's electric chair, a jury recommended.
   The jury Wednesday convicted Newton Carlton Slawson of four
counts of murder in the April 11, 1989, stabbing and shooting of
Gerald Wood, 23, his wife Peggy, 21, and their two children, ages 4
and 3.
   Slawson, 35, who knew Gerald Wood, also was convicted of
manslaughter for carving Mrs. Wood's fetus out of her womb.
   On Thursday, the jury recommended the death sentence for
Slawson, 35, after an emotional 90-minute hearing in which
Slawson's mother testified she routinely abused her son when he was
a child.
   Circuit Judge Robert Bonanno, who is not bound by the jury's
recommendation of death, scheduled Slawson's sentencing for April
11.
   During a four-day trial, Slawson's attorneys never denied their
client killed the family, but claimed his friend and co-worker
Gerald Wood slipped a piece of crack cocaine into Slawson's beer,
sending him into an uncontrolled rage.
   Slawson testified he didn't remember the killings.

   Two former hostages in Lebanon today put on
blindfolds and chained themselves to a tree outside the Iranian
Embassy to protest the captivity of Terry Anderson, the U.S.
journalist abducted five years ago.
   Jean-Paul Kauffmann and Roger Auque were among 10 French
hostages released by their captors in Lebanon between 1986 and 1988.
   The two were silent during their protest, but said in a
statement: ``We have taken this action so people know how Terry
Anderson is living at this moment. He is chained. He wears a
blindfold over his eyes. He must be silent. This is how we were.
This is how he is today.''
   ``What for us is an unpleasant simulation is for him an ordeal
that has lasted for five years. We are chained up in broad
daylight, while he hasn't seen the sun for years. We can hear the
noises of the city, but he lives in a lifeless world. His cell, its
windows boarded up, is totally sealed.''
   The statement said the protest was not intended as a ``hostile
action'' against Iran, but added: ``We know the role played by
certain Iranian officials in our tragedy.''
   ``Our action is more an appeal for help, directed at a country
which also was responsible for our freedom and which holds the keys
of freedom for Terry and the others.''
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted March 16, 1985 and is the longest-held of 18
Western hostages.
   The hostages are believed held by Moslem extremists loyal to
Iran.
   After today's hour-long demonstration, Kauffmann said the tree
was a special symbol for him.
   ``Free men don't pay much attention to trees,'' he said. ``Terry
Anderson and the others have not seen a tree for five years.''
   The lights were on inside the stone, four-story embassy, but no
one was seen at the windows and no one came outside during the
demonstration. The embassy issued a statement later saying Iran
``condemned all actions of a nature to put innocent lives in
peril.''
   Both men said later that the public silence about the Western
hostages in Lebanon did not help them.
   ``It is this silence that is prolonging the ordeal of the
hostages,'' said Kauffmann, who spent three years in captivity
before his release in May 1988. He has frequently said that
continued pressure from the French press during his detention
helped in his release.
   ``When was the last time anybody talked about Terry Anderson?''
he asked. ``Well, last year on March 16. His family is talking into
a vacuum.''

   China's leading daily newspaper today accused
Western journalists of biased reporting and rejected their
complaints that they have been followed and harassed by undercover
police.
   The official People's Daily said that some foreign reporters
``distort facts, spread rumors, maliciously attack the Chinese
government and deliberately jeopardize the security of the
country.''
   The allegations came one day after Guy Dinmore, a correspondent
for the British news agency Reuters, was called into the Foreign
Ministry and told that claims by foreign reporters that they are
being followed and harassed by Chinese police were ``absolutely
unfounded.''
   The newspaper commentary reiterated the Foreign Ministry's
position that some journalists who claim to have been spied on were
``oversensitive,'' while others were trying to cover up illegal
activities.
   ``Their purpose is none other than to whip up media opinion so
as to provide some anti-China forces with a stick to beat China and
try to facilitate their own illegal activities in the future,'' the
newspaper said.
   The government has provided no details of any such illegal
activities.
   Correspondents from nearly a dozen countries, including the
United States and the Soviet Union said they have been followed by
plainclothes police in recent weeks.
   They said police intimidation has interfered with their work and
that their Chinese contacts have been questioned by security
officials and told not to meet foreign reporters.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist premier urged
cautious steps toward reunification, but a new survey today
suggested that nearly half of all East Germans favor an immediate
joining after their first free election Sunday.
   ``I am for a united fatherland, not for a hasty fatherland,''
Premier Hans Modrow told the newspaper Berliner Zeitung. He added
that unification should be step by step to guarantee Europe's peace.
   A nationwide survey conducted jointly by the Central Institute
for Youth Research and the Institute for Market Research in Leipzig
said that 71 percent of the people are optimistic about their
future, a 10-point increase since a similar poll in February.
   Nearly 50 percent of those questioned wanted immediate
unification with West Germany, and 60 percent favored the new state
to be militarily neutral, the institutes said. The institutes did
not say how many people were polled and gave no margin of error.
   Among those cautious about quick unification were mostly members
of the Communist Party. According to the poll, Modrow remains the
most popular East German politician, with an approval rating of 75
percent.
   Modrow praised the work of his outgoing caretaker government,
which included 13 other parties and groups. He also said the former
Communists expect to be in the opposition and would make
``constructive proposals to serve the people.''
   Modrow's Communist-led government said Thursday it has succeeded
in pulling East Germany's economy back from the brink of collapse.
   The news about the economy came as candidates for the 24 parties
and groupings made campaign appearances before Sunday's election
for a new 400-member parliament. About 12.3 million East Germans
are eligible to vote.
   ``Overall, the government has been able to lead the German
Democratic Republic onto the way out of its crisis,'' government
spokesman Wolfgang Meyer told a news conference.
   Meyer assured East Germans that the economy had stabilized and
there was a ``light upward trend.'' He offered no examples of which
sectors of the economy were improving.
   ``To some extent, people have become aware of avoiding a
head-over-heels rush to unification,'' he added.
   The Communists and smaller left-wing parties say citizens could
lose the social safety net to which they have grown accustomed,
though the West German government provides social benefits.
   Early this year the economy was reported near collapse, sapped
by warning strikes and a continuing westward exodus of dissatisfied
East Germans, mainly workers in their prime. Nearly half a million
East Germans have fled to their rich western neighbor since last
year.
   But some West German businessmen recently have said the gloom
may have been exaggerated.
   The rush of West German companies into East Germany to position
themselves for eventual unity has led to hope the country's economy
will recover but fear that modernization of the obsolete factories
will cost tens of thousands of jobs.
   Modrow's government, which took office in November after the
ouster of hard-line Communist Erich Honecker, includes eight
ministers from pro-democracy organizations.
   Together, they have been asking East Germans to slow the rush
toward unity, arguing there are still positive elements in the
socialist system.
   The daily outflow of 2,500 East Germans has strained relations
with West Germany, which has said it will close centers for the
resettlers.
   Aftershocks were felt following the resignation of a senior
conservative candidate who admitted he worked for the now virtually
disbanded secret police.
   The affair sparked rumors that other politicians could have
collaborated with the once all-controlling force, and the
left-of-center Social Democrats denied that they had informants in
their top ranks.
   Following the first scandal involving one of the new parties, a
minister in the caretaker government was named new chief of the
Democratic Awakening, a conservative party.
   Protestant clergyman Rainer Eppelmann, 47, replaced Wolfgang
Schnur, a lawyer who resigned Wednesday after admitting he
collaborated with the hated secret police, or Stasi, now virtually
disbanded. Schnur was expelled from the party Thursday.
   Democratic Awakening is in a three-party election alliance that
has received enormous support from West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.

   Beirut newspapers today published a
letter to U.S. hostage Terry Anderson from the mother of his child
on the fifth anniversary of his abduction in west Beirut.
   Local television stations also planned to screen a videotape of
Anderson's 4-year-old daughter, Sulome, who was born 83 days after
Anderson was kidnapped.
   As Anderson began his sixth year in captivity, pro-Iranian
kidnappers threatened to kill three American educators they are
holding unless the United States meets their unspecified demands.
The State Department denounced the threat as a ``cynical
manipulation'' of the hostage relatives timed with ceremonies for
Anderson.
   In Damascus, former President Jimmy Carter said today he thought
chances for the hostages' release were better than they have been
for ``some years.''
   He said he did not know if there were any secret U.S. dealings
on the matter but said ``there are statements being made from
Tehran that to me are encouraging.''
   Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was seized March 16, 1985. He is the longest-held
hostage, although some others have been held almost as long.
   In a videotape broadcast on NBC's ``Today'' show and scheduled
for broadcast on Beirut television, Anderson's daughter Sulome is
seen at home in Nicosia, Cyprus, dancing for her father, then
speaking to him.
   ``I love you Daddy,'' the girl says. ``Come home. Please come
home. Send me to the circus.'' She thanks her father for a bicycle
she was given for Christmas in his name.
   In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Madeleine
Bassil told Anderson that she and their daughter also feel like
hostages.
   ``We are in as much captivity, Terry, only our living space is
bigger here and it's shared by millions. I know you will keep well,
I know you will never give up.
   ``The world without God is not the world, it's hell,'' she said.
``A home without a husband or father is not a home, it's hell.
   ``I wonder if you know that Sulome will be five years old in
June.
   ``Tonight a videotape of her will be shown on TV. Will you be
able to see it, to see her pretending she is talking to you?
   ``Until we meet again soon. God bless you. We love you,'' the
letter concluded.
   In Paris, two former hostages, Jean-Paul Kauffmann and Roger
Auque, put on blindfolds and chained themselves to a tree outside
the Iranian Embassy to protest Anderson's captivity.
   In Washington, relatives of Anderson and other hostages gathered
for a commemorative ceremony in Lafayette Park across from the
White House.
   In Tokyo, where Anderson worked from 1977 to 1981, foreign
correspondents raised empty glasses in a tribute to their colleague.
   On Thursday, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine
said in a statement that it is ``holding agents and spies against
our people and they will be executed if the American administration
fails to meet our demands.''
   The group did not specify its demands. It previously offered to
trade professors Robert Polhill, 55, of New York City; Alann Steen,
50, of Boston; and Jesse Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, for 400 Arab
inmates of Israeli jails. Israel said no, and the Reagan
administration refused to pressure Israel.
   The three American educators were kidnapped at gunpoint on Jan.
24, 1987, from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University
College.
   A handwritten statement in Arabic was delivered to the
independent newspaper An-Nahar, accompanied by a new photograph of
Steen. A statement to a Western news agency was accompanied by a
recent picture of Polhill.
   Steen and Polhill are among 18 Westerners, including eight
Americans, held hostage in Lebanon.
   In its statement the Islamic Jihad also accused the United
States of responsibility for the emigration of Soviet Jews to
Israel ``after pressure on the Soviets who succumbed and
collaborated in this big conspiracy.''
   The statement warned, ``Our people shall not stand handcuffed in
front of this conspiracy. We shall not at all suffice ourselves by
watching but shall begin taking the adequate measures to prevent
the arrival of the Soviets.
   ``All airports facilitating the transport as well as airlines,
their jetliners and offices, will be direct targets for us. This is
a warning and a threat.''
   The Kremlin has lifted restrictions on Jewish emigration and
hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews now are expected in Israel.
The issue has provoked a storm of protest in the Arab world.
   Arabs fear the Soviet Jews will settle in the occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians hope to create a homeland.
   The letter from the Islamic Jihad, which is believed comprised
of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran, said people and
organizations that recently said the hostages should be freed on
humanitarian grounds should stay out of the matter. The group
``denounces media reports about humanitarian moves to free the
hostages and close this case,'' the statement said.
   The Tehran Times newspaper in Iran, which has close ties to
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said in recent editorials
that the hostages should be freed on Islamic, humanitarian grounds.
Rafsanjani said he believed the issue was moving oward a solution.
   Sheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual guide of Lebanon's
Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a sermon last month that a
humanitarian means of freeing the hostages must be found.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the Shiite umbrella organization for
the extremist groups holding the foreign hostages.

   Space shuttle Discovery made an
overnight trip to the launch pad to prepare for its planned April
flight but could be forced back to its hangar for repairs,
officials said today.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the
shuttle was bolted to its pad at Kennedy Space Center at 4:32 a.m.,
and technicians immediately began connecting power cables and other
equipment.
   But engineers still did not know whether Discovery's nose wheel
contained a faulty axle nut like those found Thursday on Columbia
and Atlantis.
   Columbia's axle assembly has been sent back to its manufacturer
for examination after engineers spent the day examining the nuts.
   ``If we have to roll it back to fix it, we'll roll it back,''
NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson said after the worn landing gear
parts were discovered in the other two space planes.
   Discovery, mounted atop a giant tracked crawler, started the
3.5-mile trek from its assembly building at 7:55 p.m. Thursday
after a 12-hour delay.
   Officials ordered the postponement after inspectors found the
crooked nuts, which secure seals to axle bearings on the nose
wheels. They didn't want to risk landing Discovery until they
learned whether the problem would affect the gear at touchdown.
   Discovery, scheduled for launch April 12, is to deploy the $1.5
billion Hubble telescope during its five-day mission. From space,
the telescope will be able to see galaxies distant enough to
provide scientists with clues about the beginning of the universe.
   A dress rehearsal of the launch countdown with Discovery's five
astronauts is scheduled to begin Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   The American Medical Association for the first
time is purging from its membership doctors who have been convicted
of felonies, sold illegal drugs or in other ways behaved in
unethical ways.
   The AMA recently revoked the membership of 31 physicians,
general counsel Kirk Johnson said. The AMA did not identify the
doctors, most of whom had already lost their license to practice
medicine.
   ``The reason we (started this program) was as much as anything a
symbolic gesture,'' said Johnson. ``But we did want to send a
signal that the AMA was not afraid of expelling members.''
   Johnson said loss of membership can be costly to physicians who
can still legally practice. In some states, he said, expelled
doctors can't buy malpractice insurance from state medical
associations.
   Purged doctors can appeal the AMA's decision, he said.

   Pro-Cuban rebels in Lima bombed the campaign
headquarters of front-running presidential candidate and novelist
Mario Vargas Llosa, causing damage but no injuries, police said.
   The rebels also tried to topple with dynamite charges six
campaign billboards of candidates linked to Vargas Llosa in
different sectors of the city, but police said the explosions did
little damage.
   Police said dynamite was tossed at the FREDEMO campaign
headquarters at 10 p.m. Thursday when about 30 campaign workers met
in the building in a Lima suburb. The explosion broke windows but
nobody was hurt, police said.
   FREDEMO is the coalition of center-right parties supporting
Vargas Llosa in the April 8 presidential election.
   Police said they found fliers of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement on the ground after the blast that read, ``With the masses
for the liberation of the fatherland and social justice.''
   The movement is a pro-Cuban group that has been fighting Peru's
elected governments since 1984. It operates mainly in the northern
and eastern jungles and occasionally bombs commercial and
government targets in Lima.
   Vargas Llosa recently urged Cuba's leader, Fidel Castro, to hold
public elections or be ``condemned by history for eternity.''

<TEXT>
   Two teen-age boys were acquitted of
raping a 16-year-old girl during a drinking party at the governor's
mansion, a circuit judge said.
   The two 17-year-old boys and another 17-year-old have admitted
to charges of underage consumption of alcohol stemming from the
Nov. 28 incident in Pierre, sai Circuit Judge Marshall Young on
Thursdsay.
   The girl took an overdose of pills Wednesday night and was
hospitalized, said her attorney, Rick Johnson of Gregory. She was
recovering at home Thursday, Johnson said.
   One of the boys was charged with non-forcible rape of the girl,
who allegedly was not capable of giving consent because she was
intoxicated, and another boy was charged with aiding and abetting
rape, Young said.
   Following a two-day trial closed to reporters, Young said he
found the state had not proved the rape charge and
aiding-and-abetting charge beyond a reasonable doubt.
   ``It isn't a finding of guilt or innocence. It's a finding of
whether or not the state has met the burden of reasonable doubt,''
Young said. ``After listening to two days of testimony and
reviewing the evidence, there was reasonable doubt.''
   The judge's finding was equivalent to an acquittal on the sexual
offenses, lawyers said.
   The judge said the three juvenile boys will be sentenced on the
alcohol offenses during a hearing April 6. Their names were not
disclosed because of their age.
   Johnson said Thursday night that testimony indicated there was a
party and a ``tremendous amount of alcohol.''
   Gov. George Mickelson, his wife, Linda, and their 17-year-old
son, David, were seen entering the Stanley County Courthouse while
the trial was under way.
   The governor was ``gratified about the judge's decision,'' said
Mickelson's press secretary, Gretchen Lord Anderson.
   The governor and his wife were out of town on the date of the
alleged rape at the mansion. Their son David is the only other
permanent resident there. The governor's office has refused to
disclose his whereabouts that evening.
   Thursday's findings mean that the four youths have admitted
allegations of underage consumption of alcohol at the mansion on
Nov. 28.
   In addition to the three juvenile boys, 18-year-old David Ebach
pleaded guilty in adult court in January to underage consumption.

<TEXT>
   The American director of the World Health
Organization's AIDS program resigned today, citing disagreements
with the organization's leader over a global strategy for combating
the fatal disease.
   Dr. Jonathan Mann has led WHO's fight against acquired immune
deficiency syndrone since 1986. His resignation takes effect in
June.
   Mann said his decision to resign was prompted by differences
with WHO's director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima.
   ``We have created the foundation and the structure of WHO's
critical and ongoing role in global AIDS prevention and control,''
he wrote Nakajima in his letter of resignation.
   ``However, on the basis of my experience during the last two
years, I have now come to the conclusion that there is a great
variance between our positions on a series of issues which I
consider critical for the global AIDS strategy and the WHO Global
Program on AIDS.'' he wrote.
   His letter of resignation and a memorandum to his program staff
gave no details of those differences.
   The letters came after weeks of rumors about low morale among
WHO's 4,500-staff, with many blaming Nakajima's management style.
   Critics have complained of autocratic methods and of sudden
transfers without prior notice. The Netherland's mission to the
U.N., in a confidential letter quoted by Dutch newspapers earlier
this year, reportedly said that work at the agency was fast
deteriorating.
   Nakajima, 61, took office in 1988, the first Japanese to head a
U.N. agency. Before taking the position, he was in charge of WHO's
Manila-based regional office for the Western Pacific since 1979.
   WHO spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said Nakajima planned to leave
for Afghanistan tonight and was not available for comment.
   Mann, a public health official who grew up in Boston and majored
in history at Harvard, joined WHO in June 1986. The program then
consisted of Mann and a secretary, with funds coming from the
regular WHO budget.
   The program now has a staff of close to 200 and a special budget
that has tripled in the past three years to $109 million.
   Mann, 42, has traveled throughout the world to push a worldwide
campaign to control the AIDS epidemic that has spread to more than
150 countries since it was first identified in 1981.
   More than 220,000 cases were registered worldwide by the WHO as
of last month, and Mann estimates that there will be 6 million
cases by the year 2000.
   Mann has said that the huge increase will come when millions of
people who have already been exposed to AIDS develop the disease.
   AIDS is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.

   Rising social and political unrest contributed
to the killings of at least 53 journalists in 1989, more than
double the number slain because of their work in the previous year,
a study says.
   Two-thirds of the killings occurred in Latin America, including
14 in El Salvador alone, said the Committee to Protect Journalists.
It labeled the slayings ``censorship by death.''
   The report was released Thursday, the same day Iraq hanged
Farzad Bazoft, a London-based reporter accused of spying. Bazoft
had been investigating reports of mass deaths in an explosion at a
military complex.
   Sonia Goldenberg, executive director of the committee, said
today that the hanging combined with her group's report and the
five-year captivity of Associated Press reporter Terry Anderson in
Lebanon are ``striking evidence'' of how many journalists are
murdered and imprisoned ``for doing a job we take for granted.''
   Goldenberg said the Bazoft hanging was the committee's top
priority and that it will do more than its usual practice of
sending letters of condemnation.
   ``If we don't raise a protest in the loudest terms, we are
afraid that other countries might take this example, and we cannot
allow this,'' Goldenberg said at a Washington news conference. She
did not disclose what steps the organization will take.
   Another group, Freedom House, has put the number of journalists
killed last year at 73. The two monitors could not explain the
difference but noted that each uses its own sources of information
and methods of confirmation.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists said harassment, expulsions
and arrests of reporters also increased, with 60 expelled from
countries where they were working, at least 250 arrested and about
90 assaulted.
   The 53 who were slain was about double the 26 killed in 1988 _ a
number that had held roughly steady for several years, the
committee said.
   In addition to those killed in El Salvador, which is torn by
guerrilla war, Latin America recorded 11 journalist deaths in
drug-scarred Colombia, five in Peru, two in Brazil and one each in
Ecuador and Guatemala.
   One journalist was killed in crossfire in the U.S. invasion of
Panama. While that seemed accidental and motives for some killings
were unclear, most apparently were politically motivated or the
work of organized crime, the committee said. It did not count
killings that clearly were not work-related.
   ``A sinister practice of censorship by death is crippling press
freedom in Latin American democracies,'' Goldenberg said in a
statement. In other countries, such as China, Ethiopia and Romania,
expulsions were the preferred method of silencing correspondents,
she said.
   The report listed 16 countries as ``cases of concern'' because
of their treatment of journalists. They included Lebanon, where
Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East correspondent, has been held
hostage for five years as of today, and China, where editor Wei
Jingsheng has been jailed 11 years.

   Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal resigned
today, triggering a political crisis for the 3-month-old government
of Prime Minister V.P. Singh and threatening to disrupt the
governing National Front coalition.
   Meanwhile, a Sikh facing trial on charges of masterminding bomb
attacks and who was earlier implicated in the 1984 assassination of
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was sworn in today as a member of the
lower house of Parliament.
   Atinder Pal Singh was brought to Parliament House from the
capital's Tihar Central Jail with an escort of armed police. The
police did not enter Parliament, and he was returned to jail after
being sworn in.
   Singh, who is unrelated to the prime minister, won a seat in
Parliament in the Nov. 22-26 general elections, despite not being
allowed out of jail to campaign. Charges in the assassination were
dropped after the election, but he still faces charges in bombings
that killed at least four people in 1988.
   Devi Lal, 75, resigned from the cabinet because he felt that
some senior leaders in the coalition were trying to malign him and
his son, United News of India said.
   A letter of resignation was sent to the prime minister, the news
agency said, but there was no word if the prime minister had
accepted it.
   Newspapers and several politicians have accusd Devi Lal's son,
Om Prakash Chauthala, of being responsible for violence and
vote-rigging in last month's elections to state assemblies.
   Chauthala was named chief minister of northern Haryana state in
December after Devi Lal resigned the post to join the federal
cabinet. Under Indian law, Chauthala had to be elected to the
Haryana state assembly within six months for the ratification of
his appointment as chief minister.
   He was a candidate for by-elections from the Meham constituency
on Feb. 27, but the polls were marked by widespread violence and
police shootings, which left at least 13 people dead. The Election
Commission, a watchdog body which oversees all polls in the
country, said new elections would be held.
   The National Front is a centrist alliance dominated by the
Janata Dal, or People's Party, of which Devi Lal and the prime
minister are members.
   It was not immediately clear if Devi Lal's resignation would
trigger a split in the Janata Dal. But Devi Lal is known to command
the following of a substantial section of the party.

   Israeli soldiers today shot and killed three
Palestinian gunmen as they attempted to cross into Israel from
southern Lebanon, the military command said.
   It said the soldiers were on a routine patrol when they spotted
the three guerrillas near the village of Ramyah, half a mile from
the Israeli border, and opened fired killing the gunmen.
   No Israeli soldiers were injured in the incident, the army said.
   A military command communique said the guerrillas were
Palestinians but did not identify which faction they were
affiliated with.
   Israel radio reported a large quantity of weapons were found
next to the slain gunmen, including Soviet-made Kalashnikov rifles,
rocket-propelled grenade launchers and numerous hand grenades.
   The site of the incident was on the western edge of Israel's
self-proclaimed security zone. The 6-to-10-mile-deep zone, which
extends from the Mediterranean coast in the west to the slopes of
Mount Hermon in the east, serves as a buffer against guerrilla
infiltrations into northern Israel.
   Israeli troops and allied militiamen of the Christian-led South
Lebanon Army patrol the zone, carved out by Israel when it withdrew
the bulk of its army from Lebanon in 1985, three years after its
invasion.
   It was the second time Israeli forces and guerrillas have
clashed in the security zone this month. Five Shiite Moslem
guerrillas were killed on March 8 in a firefight with Israeli
troops in Zommaraya.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev invited radical
reformers to a high-level Communist Party debate today on further
political changes, which one top official warned could destroy the
party.
   In the first challenge he faces in his new, more powerful post
as president, Gorbachev also tried to calm the heated emotions over
Lithuania's attempt to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev began his first full day as president by chairing
today's Communist Party Central Committee meeting. In response to
this week's legalization of alternative political parties, the top
Communists are considering changing the party's structure. They
also are debating a bill they plan to propose on the regulation of
political parties.
   ``In the current wording, the law could place obstacles to the
active work of the party in workplaces,'' complained Moscow party
chief Yuri Prokofiev.
   The text of the law was not available.
   Radicals say real political freedom cannot emerge while
Communist Party groups remain in government agencies, farms, army
units, police precincts and virtually every other institution.
Those units give the party control over Soviet life and an
advantage over any new political party.
   In remarks carried by the official news agency Tass, Prokofiev
added that in the proposed law, ``there exists a real basis for
liquidating the party organizations in businesses and institutions.
This could bring the organizational destruction of the party. And
we have the sad experience of the Polish United Workers Party right
before our eyes.''
   He was referring to Poland's Communist Party, which was the
first to lose power in the revolution that swept Eastern Europe
last fall.
   Prokofiev also said the new law should limit the activities of
political parties and create a process for abolishing them if they
advocate something dangerous like nationalism or incite racial
hatred.
   The president of Kirgizia, A. Dzhumagunov, warned party leaders
that some people ``are calling for the party to leave the political
arena, to throw to oblivion our fundamental science,
Marxism-Leninism.''
   The party for decades has been run with strict control by its
highest leaders, and a promotion system ensured that they and their
supporters would remain in charge.
   Gorbachev has suggested allowing local party organizations to
decide how to choose their delegates to a critical party congress,
which he said should start July 2. Party reformers want
secret-ballot elections in which they could force out the old guard.
   Radicals want even more, urging the abolishment of Communist
Party cells in government agencies, farms, army units, police
precincts and virtually every other institution. Those cells give
the party a control over Soviet life and an advantage over any new
political party.
   Gorbachev brought to the Central Committee meeting
representatives of about 40 groups of rank-and-file Communists,
according to the Soviet news service Interfax.
   Among the groups represented was the radical Democratic
Platform, which threatened to form a competing Social Democratic
Party if the Communists fail to reform from within. It was denied
access to a Central Committee meeting in early February in which
party leaders agreed to abandon their monopoly on power and permit
legalization of alternative parties.
   The Democratic Platform was formed in January by a group of
progressive members of Congress and members of Communist Party
``clubs'' that have brought reformers together in cities across the
country. It also supports independence for the republics,
individual Communist parties in each one and abolition of the
privilege system that provides the party elite with
chauffeur-driven cars, special food and summer homes.
   Gorbachev on Thursday held only his second news conference in
Moscow, and promised to hold ``a respectful dialogue with the
people of Lithuania'' and their government. This is what the
Lithuanians are seeking, given the complexity of trying to sever
relations after 50 years of Soviet rule.
   A resolution passed by the Congress of People's Deputies stated
clearly the Soviet intention of ignoring any attempts by Lithuania
to back its defiance with actions until the conflict has been
resolved. It said the Soviet Constitution and laws remain in effect
in the Baltic republic.
   But Gorbachev asked the deputies to drop the most
confrontational rhetoric and simply direct him to protect the
rights of Soviet citizens and the Soviet Union in the Baltic
republic, pending resolution of the conflict.
   Gorbachev ignored a demand from one deputy that he immediately
impose presidential rule on Lithuania and a threat from another to
search out growing numbers of Lithuanian deserters from the Red
Army.
   The one Lithuanian who took the floor, Nikolai Medvedev, was met
with scattered cries of ``Enemy of the People!'' when he spoke. The
epithet was widespread during the witch-hunting days of dictator
Josef Stalin.
   Medvedev accused Bolshevism of causing hundreds of thousands of
deaths in Lithuania in Stalin's repressions and mass deportations.
He warned that the original, more harshly worded draft of the
resolution would only make the situation in the republic worse.
   Gorbachev, the Communist Party chief, was elected his nation's
first Western-style president by the Congress Thursday morning and
immediately took the oath of office. He promised his first actions
would include radical reforms to keep the Soviet Union from
crumbling under the weight of economic and ethnic crises.

   The state Supreme Court today upheld a
lower court ruling ordering striking teachers in one county back to
work.
   Attorney General Roger Tompkins said he would file papers
immediately to apply the 4-0 court ruling to striking teachers
throughout the state.
   The strike, which began March 7 over pay and benefits, has idled
about half of the state's 328,000 students and up to two-thirds of
its 22,000 teachers.
   ``It is clear the involved teachers have existing employment
contracts which ... cover their wages, hours and other conditions
of employment,'' said the opinion written by Justice Thomas Miller.
   ``We are not aware of any court, which ... has held that
teachers who are presently under contract of employment could not
be enjoined from engaging in a work stoppage or strike for higher
wages,'' the court said.
   The ruling, with Justice Thomas McHugh not participating,
upholds a Jefferson County Circuit Court order telling striking
teachers in that county to return to work.
   The West Virginia Education Association, the state's largest
union with 16,000 members, had sought to block that order. The West
Virginia Federation of Teachers, which joined in the argument,
declined to comment.
   Kathy McQuarrie, a spokeswoman for the WVEA, said the strike
would continue despite today's ruling. ``We're not going to
comment. The court will do what the court will do,'' she said.
   McQuarrie said the association is continuing its efforts to meet
with legislative leaders ``to come to a meeting of the minds on how
to resolve this crisis.''
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the WVEA said the union isn't
satisfied with a $27 million ``equity'' pay plan the Legislature
approved Thursday night.
   The money goes toward meeting a 1984 court order that teacher
pay be equalized throughout the state. Under the plan, every
teacher will receive at least a $535 a year raise, while those in
the poorest counties will get up to $1,500 more a year, which
legislators said is an average 4 percent raise.
   ``Nationally, salaries are rising 6 percent,'' said WVEA
lobbyist Perry Bryant. ``It's a little over half of the commitment
of the rest of the country. We need to have a special session of
the Legislature for additional compensation and to address a
long-term solution.''
   Schools were closed Thursday and today by the state education
superintendent for a cooling-off period. Gov. Gaston Caperton has
encouraged county school boards to fire or otherwise punish
teachers who refuse to return to work Monday.
   Also Thursday, the state Board of Education voted to start its
own court action seeking orders requiring teachers to return to the
classrooms Monday.
   The state's teachers earn an average $21,904 a year, according
to the National Education Association, less than teachers in every
state except Arkansas and South Dakota.
   WVEA President Kayetta Meadows said her group has obtained
enough signatures on a petition from House of Delegates members to
call a special legislative session to address teacher pay. The
state constitution requires a three-fifths majority of the
100-member House and 34-member Senate to call a special session.
   Bob Brown, executive director of the West Virginia Federation of
Teachers, said just 12 senators had signed the petition by late
Thursday.
   Caperton has said the only way he can provide teacher pay raises
is to raise taxes, which he said the public opposes. The teachers
received a 5 percent pay raise earlier this year along with other
public employees.
   In preparation for hiring replacement teachers, the state board
has approved emergency certification procedures for people who have
at least a bachelor's degree.
   Meadows called the firing threat ``ludicrous'' because the state
can't find enough certified teachers to fill the vacancies it
already has.

<HEAD>Store Employee Faces Felony Charge for Selling 2 Live Crew Album</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A teen-age record store clerk is facing a
felony charge for allegedly selling the sexually explicit rap
recording ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' to an 11-year-old girl,
officials said.
   Chauncey Reese, a 19-year-old employee at Sarasota's Tracks
record store, was arrested Thursday on a complaint by the girl's
stepmother about the recording by the Miami group 2 Live Crew.
   Conviction on the charge of selling harmful materials to minors
carries a maximum prison sentence of five years and a $5,000 fine,
said Assistant State Attorney Donald Hartery Jr.
   Hartery said he filed the felony charge, rather than a
misdemeanor count of obscenity, after listening to the tape given
to police by the girl's stepmother, Ann Skolnick.
   ``The tape is just out-and-out sex,'' said Ms. Skolnick, 35.
``They use words like `anal sex' and `how women want it.' A child
does not need to be hearing that.''
   The tape bears a label warning of explicit language in the
lyrics, Ms. Skolnick said.
   Reese, who is accused of selling the tape to the girl in
January, was released on his own recognizance. Telephone messages
left late Thursday at his home were not immediately answered.
   Sarasota police spokesman Russ Nugent said he did not know of
any other arrest in the state involving the rap group's recordings.
   The platinum double-album ``Nasty'' was pulled from store
shelves across the state last month after Gov. Bob Martinez asked a
state prosecutor to consider branding the record obscene. The
prosecutor said, however, that ruling would have to come from local
officials.
   A judge in Broward County later said there was probable cause to
rule the record obscene, and deputies there told store owners they
would be prosecuted if they didn't pull it from shelves.
   Prosecutors will have to prove that Reese was aware of the law
and knew the record contained harmful material, said Milton
Mandell, the chairman of the Sarasota-Manatee chapter of the
American Civic Liberties Union.
   ``No warning was given to local record shops that the album was
obscene, as was the case in Broward County,'' Mandell said.

   Two mothers convicted of letting men
repeatedly rape their children were sentenced today to 40 years in
prison on another conviction of forcing two of the children to have
sex.
   Circuit Judge George Corsiglia sentenced Carolyn Wilson, 42, and
Annette Sanford, 34, each to 10 to 40 years in prison on one count
of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.
   Corsiglia also sentenced Wilson to 20 to 40 years and Sanford to
18 to 40 years on a second rape count. The sentences are to run
concurrently. Sanford would be eligible for parole after serving 14
years, seven months, officials said, and Wilson would be eligible
for parole after 16 years, three months.
   The women were convicted in January of forcing Wilson's
then-11-year-old son and Sanford's then-9-year-old daughter to have
sex in 1987 while the mothers watched.
   ``You took our society's most precious resource and ...
destroyed their innocence for your own distorted gratification,''
Corsiglia said. ``God knows how many generations of abuse you have
inflicted on these children. Because we know abuse begets abuse.''
   On Wednesday, a separate jury convicted the women of another
count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and one count of
third-degree criminal sexual conduct for lining their children up
and allowing men to choose among them for sex.
   They face up to life imprisonment when they are sentenced on
those convictions on March 23.
   Officials say the women routinely allowed men to visit the home
they shared from 1985-88. Authorities believe drugs or money
changed hands in exchange for access to the children. One man has
been charged.
   Defense attorneys for the women said the children concocted the
stories of sexual abuse once in foster care because they didn't
want to be returned to an admittedly abusive and neglectful home.

   John Poindexter ``didn't trust'' Congress and
preferred not to deal with the legislative branch of government, a
former White House aide testified today at Poindexter's trial.
   ``Admiral Poindexter was skeptical of the Congress,'' said
Ronald Sable, who was a legislative liaison at the Reagan White
House. ``He had not had much to do with Congress and that was his
preference ... that he would just as soon not deal with them,'' he
said.
   ``He indicated he didn't trust them,'' Sable said.
   ``What about whether he liked them?'' asked Iran-Contra
prosecutor Howard Pearl.
   ``That fell in the same category'' as not trusting them, said
Sable.
   Sable said that he had ``a difference of opinion with''
Poindexter ``on dealing with Congress.'' Sable said he told the
national security adviser that ``if I was to continue to work for
him his view of things would have to change.''
   Poindexter is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements to Congress. The
government alleges that he covered up Oliver North's assistance to
the Contras and the U.S. role in a November 1985 Hawks shipment to
Iran.
   According to testimony Thursday, Poindexter told the FBI three
days after he resigned from government that ``he had no working
knowledge'' of 1985 arms shipments to Iran.
   Poindexter said during the 15-minute interview with two agents
that he had no direct knowledge of the diversion of Iran arms sale
money to the Contras, FBI agent Ellen Glasser testified Thursday.
   The former national security adviser told the FBI he knew only
that his aide ``Ollie North ... was up to something,'' Glasser said.
   Six months after the FBI interview, Poindexter told Congress in
sworn testimony that he had approved the diversion at North's
request and that he had been involved in a November 1985 shipment
of Hawk antiaircraft missiles to Iran.
   Glasser said Poindexter agreed to the questioning in the living
room of his Rockville, Md., home on Nov. 28, 1986, after ``I told
him we were trying to learn'' about the ``arms transactions'' and
the ``diversion.''
   Poindexter, who is accused of purging more than 5,000 messages
from his computer files, told the agents that ``he did not'' know
of any destruction of documents pertinent to the Iran-Contra
affair, the FBI agent said.
   On Nov. 22, 1986, there were more than 5,000 messages at
Poindexter's computer terminal, but at 9 a.m. on Nov. 24 ``there
were zero,'' Glasser testified.
   ``This massive deletion ... occurred in November 1986,'' she
insisted under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard
Beckler. Beckler suggested the deletions might have occurred at
some other time.
   Poindexter was logged onto the computer system for a 15-hour
span Nov. 24, 1986, starting at 4:30 a.m., said Kelly Williams, who
was in charge of the computer software section at the White House
communications agency. That was the day before Poindexter resigned.
   A defense lawyer, Joseph Small, angrily moved for a mistrial,
saying Iran-Contra prosecutors had ``doctored'' documents on the
computer system that contained Poindexter's name. The government
denied Small's assertion.
   ``I don't want you to pull this kind of stunt again,'' U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene admonished Small in denying the motion.
   Williams said Poindexter's identification code was the one used
to gain access to the computer when the files were deleted.
   Prosecutor Louise Radin asked if deleting the files would be
comparable to ``taking a manila envelope and just throwing it
away?''
   ``Yes, that would be the effect,'' Williams replied.
   Poindexter is accused of deleting files from his computer in an
attempt to conceal from Congress the U.S. role in the delivery of
the Hawk missiles. The CIA assisted the shipment from Israel to
Iran.
   Glasser said she showed Poindexter chronologies of the Iran
initiative that concealed the U.S. role in the missile shipment.
She said Poindexter said he recognized them and that they had been
prepared by North for congressional hearings.
   The agent said she then asked whether they were accurate and
``he replied that they were.''
   North was convicted last April of aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress in connection with the chronologies. The
last version of the document stated that no one in the U.S.
government knew about the missile shipment until January 1986.
   Poindexter is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing
Congress and two counts of making false statements for the alleged
coverup of the arm shipment and North's military assistance to the
Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a letter from President
Bush to Peggy Say, sister of Terry Anderson, dated March 15 and
marking the occasion of Anderson's fifth year as a hostage in
Lebanon.
   Dear Mrs. Say:
   Barbara and I were deeply moved by your eloquent and profoundly
sad letter to us.
   We share your great sorrow at the approach of the fifth
anniversary of Terry's abduction. As you so poignantly expressed in
your letter, the tragedy of your brother's merciless imprisonment
exists in his missing the simple enjoyments of watching children
born and growing up. So much has changed in the life of his family
and, indeed, in the world as he knew it five long lonely years ago.
Yet so little has really changed for your brother.
   Let me assure you, your family and all the hostage families that
securing the freedom of your brother and the other American
hostages is a matter of great importance to me. We continue to call
for the immediate, unconditional, safe release of the hostages. As
a further signal of commitment to resolving this tragedy, I intend
to keep open lines of communications with all parties, including
Iran, who have influence over hostage takers. Please be assured
that your government will take advantage of all legitimate
opportunities to obtain the safe release of all of our hostages.
   Although I regret that I will be unable to be with you and the
other families as you remember the tragic day five years ago when
Terry was abducted, please be assured that Barbara and I think
often of the hostages and their families. We pray for the speedy
return of your loved one.
   Sincerely,
   George Bush

   Authorities have declared war on rats
in Stockholm, where experts say there are two rats for every human.
   The Svenska Dagbladet daily quoted officials Friday as saying
they expect it will take three years to bring the rats under
control. Starting next week, four ``commando groups'' will stalk
the sewage system armed with rat poison, the newspaper said.
   ``We will open up 8,000 sewage outlets a year and put out rat
poison,'' said Gyorgy Bellaagh of the Anticimex extermination
company.
   There are an estimated 2 million rats prowling Stockholm's
cellars, sewage pipes and subway tunnels. Some apparently are
abandoning their overcrowded subterranean domains for life above
ground.
   One family reported two rats emerged from the drains in the
bathroom floor of their apartment.

   An Italian tourist died after he was

official of the Italian Embassy said Friday.
   The officer said the incident happened Thursday and identified
the tourist as Salvatore Vasile of Salemi in Sicily.
   It appeared Vasile tried to climb on the elephant so a friend
could take a photograph, but he slipped and fell. The animal walked
over him, said the spokesman.
   Phuket is a popular international tourist destination about 430
miles south of Bangkok. Vasile was visiting Thailand as part of a

   A Shanghai court has sentenced 15 people to death
for a series of violent attacks on taxi drivers, a newspaper report
said.
   Shanghai's Xinmin Evening News reported Thursday that one of the
defendants had already been executed. He was convicted of robbing a
cab driver Feb. 4.
   Fourteen other people were sentenced to death, but five of them
received two-year reprieves, the newspaper said. It said the
sentences were handed down Thursday.
   The paper described those convicted as ``roving, ... hardened
criminals'' who, working individually and in groups, would
violently rob taxi drivers after blocking or riding in the cabs.
Some of the drivers were killed, the report said.
   Attacks on cab drivers are a serious problem in Chinese cities.
In Canton, city officials ordered cab drivers to install protective
partitions between the front and back seats.

   Labor leader Shimon Peres' parliament victory
that unseated hard-line Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir signals a
turn toward greater flexibility in negotiations on the Palestinian
question.
   But both Israeli and Palestinian commentators doubt Peres'
ability to make significant concessions or deliver a peace pact
without a larger, more stable majority in parliament.
   Peres said the government he hopes to form would hold a dialogue
with Palestinians and that Israel ``will be able to keep our
momentum toward peace.''
   His remarks indicated he would move quickly toward convening
Israeli-Palestinian talks proposed by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III.
   The parliament, or Knesset, on Thursday sided with Peres in a
60-55 vote of no-confidence against Shamir, head of the right-wing
Likud bloc. Shamir had balked at Baker's proposals, particularly
over including Arabs from east Jerusalem in any dialogue.
   Even now, however, convening talks may not be possible for many
months because of Peres' involvement in the lengthy process of
horse-trading with small factions to build a new ruling coalition.
   The 66-year-old Peres, who was prime minister from 1984 to 1986
and has served as foreign and defense minister, is a master
tactician who enjoys the intricacy of diplomatic maneuvering.
   Peres has dismissed as ``antiquated ideas'' right-wing fears
that dialogue with Palestinians would encourage unrest or lead
Israel into making territorial concessions.
   But he may lack the backing from Parliament to make much
headway. Even if he quickly patches together a coalition, it is
likely the conservative religious factions would bolt over issues
such as the status of Jerusalem.
   Peres has six weeks to forge a coalition or lose the mandate to
Likud.
   If both parties fail, elections could be called or a new
coalition sought with Likud. The process could take months, and in
the event of new Israeli elections, serious peace talks would not
be likely for months.
   In addition, Mark Heller, a political analyst at Tel Aviv
University's Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies, said the
pressures on Peres will make it difficult to reach agreement in
Cairo on Israel's proposal to hold elections in the occupied lands.
   ``If Peres heads a government, Israel will probably go to Cairo
more or less on Baker's terms,'' Heller explained. ``But I don't
think there would be room for an agreement in Cairo about
elections, except along the original Israeli lines.''
   Israel has refused to negotiate with the PLO, which it calls a
terrorist organization, and conservatives in Israel oppose allowing
Arabs from east Jerusalem to participate in the proposed elections.
   Peres has invested so much political capital in bringing down
Shamir, that he has been forced into the defensive on these issues,
Heller said. Without PLO flexibility, it would be difficult to come
to agreement in Cairo, he said.
   Furthermore, Heller said a Cairo meeting might intensify
internal Palestinian debate, with radicals using more violence to
prevent concessions.
   Writing in the conservative Maariv newspaper, commentator Moshe
Zak also warned that unrealistic expectations had arisen in Israel
that if the Cairo meeting took place, the 27-month-old Palestinian
uprising would fade away.
   ``On the contrary, the PLO will try to accompany the meeting
with increased actions of hate against Israel in order to press its
claims and to break the national consensus in Israel on
Jerusalem,'' he wrote.
   At least 663 Palestinians and 43 Israelis have died in the
uprising. The cost in extra Israeli military expenses and damage to
the economy and tourism totals more than $1 billion.
   Jamil Tarifi, a West Bank moderate mentioned as a possible
negotiator, said it was a victory for PLO chairman Yasser Arafat's
peace initiative to seek a Palestinian state through negotiations.
   ``This crisis in Israel is a result of a Palestinian peace
initiative. Palestinians successfully played the game ... I hope
there will be less tension,'' said Tarifi.
   But many other Palestinians were doubtful about how far Labor
could go toward agreement without more support in parliament.
   Sayeed Kanaan, a businessman from the West Bank town of Nablus
and a pro-PLO moderate, said ``with the existing parliament ... it
is hard to move forward.''
   He said the Palestinian uprising would not slacken ``until there
is a radical change in the public opinion in Israel.''

   A study indicates the number of new AIDS cases
each year will decline in the United States, but two federal
researchers say the conclusion is flawed.
   The study, carried in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, says emerging cases will continue to decrease ``to a
still-to-be-determined but probably low endemic level before the
year 2000.''
   The work of Dennis Bregman and Alexander Langmuir of the
University of Southern California was criticized in two editorials
in the journal written by researchers for the federal Centers for
Disease Control and the National Cancer Institute.
   The editor of the journal, Dr. George Lundberg, said today that,
while it is unusual for the journal to carry two editorials
criticizing a study, experts in the field felt the Bregman and
Langmuir study warranted consideration.
   ``Three world-class peer reviewers urged us to publish the
Bregman paper,'' Lundberg said. ``We think there's at least a
possibility that this historic approach could be right. Only time
will tell.
   ``However, because we anticipated a great uproar, especially
from the political community if we published this paper, we
published two editorials ... criticizing the work.''
   Bregman and Langmuir used a statistical model called Farr's Law
of Epidemics, first used in 1840. The model states that epidemics
tend to rise and fall symmetrically in a normal, bell-shaped curve.
   Using data from the Atlanta-based CDC, Bregman and Langmuir say
920 cases of AIDS were reported in 1982, followed by increases in
new cases of AIDS each year until 1987, the last complete year
available for statistics, with 19,333 new cases.
   Using Farr's Law, they then project 21,978 new cases in 1988,
21,604 in 1989 and 18,363 in 1990. Using Farr's Law, the number of
new cases would continue declining, reaching 921 in 1995. They
project 200,000 cases of the deadly disease by 1995.
   Nationwide through January, the CDC has reported 121,645 cases
of AIDS since reporting began in 1981. The disease has killed
72,580 of those patients.
   Bregman said the findings suggest a need for re-evaluating AIDS
strategy.
   ``If you continue to focus on the increasing number of cases,
then it draws attention away from focusing on the emerging,
persistent endemic problem in our community,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles.
   Mitchell Gail, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer
Institute in Rockville, Md., said in an editorial that Farr's Law
may be inapplicable to the AIDS epidemic.
   Gail and co-author Ron Brookmeyer of Johns Hopkins University
said CDC surveys and other indicators have noted as many as 1
million Americans carry the AIDS virus.
   ``If a large fraction of those infected go on to develop
clinical AIDS, as is consistent with available data on the AIDS
incubation distribution, then the estimate of 200,000 cumulate
cases will fall seriously short,'' they wrote.
   Gail said Farr's Law would be applicable with a closed
population _ as in the case of a measles outbreak on an island in
which no one was coming or going.
   ``The incidence of measles will go up sharply, but then down
sharply,'' Gail said. ``Does that analogy apply to AIDS? Is the
population closed? I don't believe so.''
   Gail said Bregman and Langmuir's findings could have dangerous
implications for future health care.
   ``To read their paper, you're left with the impression that (the
number of future AIDS cases) will be easily managed in an affluent
society. I don't think that's necessarily a realistic perception,''
Gail said.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

the ANC expected to join formal talks. Pickup 5th, `De Klerk
legalized...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today it
would begin talks with Nelson Mandela and exiled African National
Congress leaders on April 11 to clear the way for formal
black-white negotiations on a new constitution.
   President F.W. de Klerk's office said in a statement that the
president and his Cabinet would meet ANC leaders to deal with
``obstacles perceived to obstruct the process toward negotiations.''
   There was no immediate comment from the ANC, the main black
group fighting the white government. However, the organization said
last month it wanted to hold preliminary talks with de Klerk ``as
soon as possible.''
   De Klerk's statement gave no additional details on the
unprecedented talks. Leaders from the ANC's exile headquarters in
Zambia are expected to be part of the delegation, de Klerk's office
said.
   The government has made clear that the ANC would be only one of
several black-led organizations it would invite to formal talks on
a new constitution.
   Among others, the government has said that leaders of South
Africa's 10 black homelands, such as Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
political leader of the Zulus, also would be present.
   The relatively conservative Buthelezi, a proponent of
capitalism, has long been at odds with the ANC over its use of
violence and support for economic sanctions against South Africa.
   The ANC was banned from 1960 until last month, and many ANC
leaders will be making their first trip to South Africa since
heading into exile more than a quarter-century ago.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and more than 60 other anti-apartheid
groups Feb. 2. Nine days later he freed Mandela, who had been
imprisoned for more than 27 years for helping to launch the ANC
sabotage campaign.
   Mandela was in Sweden today, wrapping up a week-long visit
during which he saw ANC President Oliver Tambo, who is recovering
from a stroke. He was not available for immediate comment but was
due to address a rally later today. He is expected to return to
South Africa this weekend.
   Mandela recently was elected the ANC's deputy president, which
makes him effective leader of the organization while the
72-year-old Tambo recuperates.
   De Klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will
bring blacks into the national government. However, he opposes the
one-man, one-vote system that the ANC and other leading
anti-apartheid groups favor.
   De Klerk envisions some mechanism that will allow whites to
maintain veto power on major policy decisions.
   The ANC has said it will meet with the de Klerk government, but
will not open formal talks on a new constitution until the
president lifts the state of emergency and releases all political
prisoners.
   On Thursday, opposition leaders said a wave of unrest sweeping
through South Africa was threatening government efforts to open
negotiations on power-sharing.
   Officials say the wave of violence is the worst to hit South
Africa since the mid-1980s. About 300 people have been killed in
fighting during the past month, mainly in black townships.
   Police said today that three people died in black townships when
residents spread false rumors that a rival group of blacks was
planning an attack, causing mass panic.
   Thousands of women and children in several townships south of
Johannesburg fled their homes Thursday evening for refuge at
hospitals, police stations and trade union offices after hearing a
rumor that a group of Zulus would attack, the police said. Men
remained at home, arming themselves and setting up roadblocks.
   In one of several incidents, a 40-year-old white man driving his
luxury car past the black residential area of Sebokeng, south of
Johannesburg, was killed when local residents stopped his car and
hit him in the head with a machete, police said. Drivers who failed
to stop at the roadblocks, made of huge rocks, had their cars
stoned by a mob that numbered in the hundreds, they said.
   Police also said two township residents in the same area
apparently died of shock after hearing the rumors of an impending
attack.
   The Zulus, one of several black tribes in South Africa, come
from the southeast part of the country. Most blacks in the
Johannesburg area belong to other tribes.
   Elsewhere, a black man was killed in an exchange of gunfire with
army troops in a township outside the port city of Durban, police
added.

   Friends and supporters from Terry
Anderson's hometown fasted today to urge freedom for all Western
hostages in Lebanon and for peace in the Middle East.
   ``Tonight we gather with our lighted candles and our paper
cranes and we pray ... that these would be the words that could
free the hostages,'' Sister Pauline M. Petruzzella told about 180
people who attended an interfaith service Thursday night in this
Buffalo suburb, marking the start of the 24-hour fast.
   The Roman Catholic nun also offered a prayer for the
hostage-takers of Lebanon, ``that they could be freed of their
anger, their hurts, their frustration.''
   The service and fast marked the fifth anniversary of Anderson's
abduction in Beirut. The Associated Press' chief Middle East
correspondent, who grew up in Batavia, 40 miles east of Buffalo, is
the longest held of 18 Western hostages.
   Today is his 1,826th day in captivity.
   He is now 42. He has never seen his 4-year-old daughter. He may
not know his father and brother died in 1986.
   In Orchard Park, 60 children, one for each month of his
captivity, carried paper cranes, a traditional Japanese symbol of
peace.
   Later in the service, the children held aloft pictures of
Anderson and 11 other hostages as their names and dates of
captivity were read.
   Among those attending the service from Batavia were Penny
Anderson, Terry's sister-in-law; Carl Anderson, a cousin; and Anne
Zickl, a Batavia resident who has never met Terry but has become a
leader of local efforts to win his release.
   Other observances occurred today in New York City, Washington,
D.C., Cyprus and Tokyo. In Lorain, Ohio, where Anderson was born,
veterans fired a rifle salute, and three Anderson cousins tied a
large yellow ribbon around the city's flagpole today.
   The Batavia group planned to break their fast at a service
tonight. A separate service was planned in Orchard Park.
   The idea to fast 24 hours in support of the hostages was
conceived by Buffalo Area Metropolitan Ministries and was adopted
enthusiastically by Peggy Say, Anderson's sister and the leader of
efforts to free the hostages.
   Say, who will fast as she attends ceremonies today in
Washington, said in a letter read at the service here that foreign
leaders with whom she met in a recent trip to the Middle East had
been deeply moved by the idea of a fast.
   ``Never before had I been so warmly received everywhere with so
many positive assurances of help,'' she wrote.
   The Rev. Francis X. ``Butch'' Mazur, a priest at the Orchard
Park church, urged all who support the hostages to give up
something of value for the day.
   ``It may mean abstaining from one of the three meals that you
would have in the next 24 hours,'' Mazur said. ``For little kids,
it may mean fasting from candy or soda pop. For others, it may mean
fasting from television or coffee or caffeine.''
   Fasting ``is a transformation of self, which leads to a
transformation of society, which takes its shape from our lives,''
he said.
   Many in the congregation signed pledges to do just that.
   ``I hereby commit myself to one day of prayer and fasting for
Terry's release and the release of all innocent human beings held
hostage anywhere in the world,'' the pledges read.

<HEAD>Post Office Travel, Bonuses Criticized</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank is defending
post office spending on travel and bonuses in the face of criticism
from a senator and a member of the commission that rules on postal
rates.
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., took the Postal Service to task for
sending officials to conferences in various parts of the country _
including Hawaii and Florida. And John Crutcher of the Postal Rate
Commission told Washington newspapers he's upset that top post
office managers received performance bonuses ranging from $3,000 to
$11,000 in 1988.
   Just last week, the post office announced plans to seek an
increase in postal rates, citing a fiscal outlook that could
present the agency with its largest dollar loss ever in this year.
   The new rates, including a 30-cent first-class stamp, would take
effect next year if approved by the independent Postal Rate
Commission.
   Commission member John Crutcher complained to Washington
newspapers about the bonuses paid to postal managers, saying:
``Surely some of them are so bad some should be fired instead of
getting an award.''
   ``Managers are awarded bonuses for superior performance. Those
who achieve or exceed specific goals in numerous categories are
compensated accordingly and those who don't are not,'' Frank
responsed Thursday.
   Pryor, meanwhile, cited a General Accounting Office report that
said the Postal Service spent more than $6 million last year on
travel for administrators attending conferences.
   ``At a time when the Postal Service is crying about its fiscal
crisis and threatening to reduce service unless it can raise
postage rates, it's nothing short of an outrage to find it has been
spending money this way,'' Pryor said in a statement.
   Frank said the meetings and conferences were ``necessary for the
proper conduct of our business.''
   ``Participants always spent more than eight hours a day in these
meetings. Despite the sometimes exotic locations, room rates ranged
from $63 to $98 dollars a day, but some meal costs appear high,''
Frank said in a statement.
   He did not elaborate on the meal costs, but added that ``there
is room for improvement.''
   The Postal Service, which no longer receives tax subsidies, was
established as a semi-independent agency in 1971 and directed to
operate like a private business.

   An Air Force F-16A jet fighter crashed
near the Utah-Nevada line today, and its pilot ejected and
parachuted safely, authorities said.
   The $16 million aircraft went down on the western Utah Salt
Flats about three miles east of here about 9:30 a.m. MST, said
Tooele County Sheriff's Sgt. Joe Bradshaw.
   He said the only crewman, a Hill Air Force Base pilot whose
identity was not immediately released, had been taken to Wendover
Air Force Base for debriefing. Hill crews were dispatched to the
wreckage, authorities said.
   Mitch Barker, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in Seattle, said he understood the pilot ejected
after the aircraft's engine failed.
   He said the F-16A was en route to Wendover from Hill Air Force
Base in northern Utah at the time of the crash.
   Hill officials said the aircraft had undergone maintenance there
and left at 8:55 a.m. on a test mission.

   Latin American democracies proved the most
dangerous places for journalists to work last year, according to a
report released Friday.
   The 53 killings in 1989 included many murders ``where
journalists were killed in retaliation for what they had written or
to prevent what they were going to write,'' Sonia Goldenberg,
executive director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said
Friday.
   The formal release of the report at a news conference came a day
after Iraq hanged a London-based journalist it accused of spying.
It came on the fifth anniversary of the day Terry Anderson, the
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was
kidnapped in Lebanon.
   The death toll last year was more than double the 1988 total of
26 dead, the committee reported. It called the slayings
``censorship by death.''
   Goldenberg said expulsions, which she called another form of
censorship, also doubled to 60. She said journalists were most
frequently expelled from China, Ethiopia and Romania.
   The committee also counted 325 journalists arrested and 102
physically assaulted in 1989, figures it said were higher than the
previous year.
   The report listed 16 countries as ``cases of concern'' because
of their treatment of journalists. They included Lebanon, where
three journalists including Anderson are being held hostage, and
China, where editor Wei Jingsheng has been jailed 11 years.
   However, two-thirds of last year's killings occurred in Latin
America, the committee said, including 14 in El Salvador, where a
civil war is raging. There were 11 deaths in Colombia; five in
Peru; two in Brazil; and one each in Ecuador and Guatemala.
   ``We are talking about democracies,'' Goldenberg said. She and
others said journalists need to make sure the public knows about
atrocities and the U.S. government feels pressure to ensure its
foreign aid recipients observe human rights.
   The trend toward greater violence and censorship was broken by
good news at year's end from the emerging democracies of Eastern
Europe. Goldenberg cited the freeing of imprisoned journalists and
new press freedoms in several countries.
   Alexandr Kramer, a Prague writer, said he was visiting the West
to ``relearn his craft'' with several colleagues under a United
States Information Agency program. He said many Czech journalists
must learn how to break a long habit of self-censorship.
   ``We don't have many complaints in Czechoslovakia nowadays,''
Kramer said. ``There is a boom of new periodicals. Everyone can
write what he thinks.''
   Farzad Bazoft, who was reporting for The Observer of London, was
hanged Thursday after the Iraqi government convicted him of spying.
He had been investigating reports of mass deaths in an accident at
a military complex. Goldenberg said his execution will be a top
priority for the committee this year.
   ``If we don't raise a protest in the loudest terms, we are
afraid that other countries might take this example, and we cannot
allow this,'' she said. She did not disclose what steps the
organization will take.
   Another group, Freedom House, has put the number of journalists
killed last year at 73. The two monitors could not explain the
difference but noted each uses its own sources of information and
methods of confirmation.
   One journalist was killed in crossfire in the U.S. invasion of
Panama. Although that seemed accidental and motives for some
killings were unclear, most apparently were politically motivated
or the work of organized crime, the committee said. It did not
count killings that clearly were not work-related.
   The 16 countries cited by the committee as ``cases of concern''
are China, Colombia, Cuba, El Salvador, Iraq, Israel, Kenya,
Lebanon, Liberia, Peru, Romania, Singapore, South Africa, the
Soviet Union, Sri Lanka and Turkey.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has no plans to
step down as leader of the right-wing Likud bloc, despite his
government's defeat in a parliamentary no-confidence vote, a Shamir
aide said Friday.
   Shamir met with Likud's government ministers Friday. Housing
Minister David Levy and Economics Minister Yitzhak Modai, who have
been trying to engineer Shamir's ouster for months, did not attend
the session.
   Labor leader Shimon Peres, Shamir's rival, said he hopes to form
a new government with the backing of 70 members of the 120-seat
Knesset, or parliament.
   Some Likud Parliament members suggested Friday Shamir would have
to step down as party leader since several leaders of religious
parties have accused him of breaking promises to support religious
legislation.
   But asked if Shamir was thinking of resigning, Yossi Achimeir,
director of the prime minister's office, replied, ``I didn't even
hear a hint coming out of his mouth. He will continue to lead as
long as the party wants it.''
   Under Israeli law, President Chaim Herzog decides who should
form the next government. He scheduled meetings Sunday with Labor
and Likud leaders, but Israeli newspapers reported the 66-year-old
Peres was the likely choice.
   Shamir, 74, whose government was Israel's first to be turned out
in a no-confidence vote, remains caretaker prime minister until a
new government is formed. That could take months.
   Both Labor and Likud already have begun wooing ultra-Orthodox
religious parties that hold the balance of power.
   Achimeir conceded Likud's chances for leading a new government
were ``not bright'' after five of the six Knesset member from the
ultra-Orthodox Shas Party abstained in Thursday's vote, giving
Labor its victory.
   He said he did not exclude a challenge to Shamir's leadership.
   ``I believe that Mr. Shamir will eventually decide to resign
because he cannot form a narrow government as long as Agudat Israel
opposes his leadership,'' said lawmaker Tzahi Hanegbi, referring to
an ultra-Orthdox faction that backed Labor on Thursday.
   Hanegbi said possible replacements could be Levy, former Trade
Minister Ariel Sharon, or Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   Sharon quit the Cabinet last month to protest the government's
peace policies. Arens is a protege of Shamir and would be a
compromise replacement.
   Opposition to Shamir was expected from Likud rebels such as Levy
and Sharon, but even some of the prime minister's supporters raised
the prospect of replacing him.
   ``Concerning Yitzhak Shamir, I think that's something he must
decide and I think we will speak about it in the next couple of
days,'' said Ehud Olmert, the government's Arab affairs adviser and
formerly a staunch Shamir backer.
   The dispute between Likud and Labor was over Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's plan for Israel to accept east Jerusalem Arabs
and deported Palestinians in a delegation to talk peace with
Israel. Shamir had argued that including them might threaten
Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.
   Likud has 40 seats and Labor 39 in the Knesset. With the backing
of the 11 Agudat and Shas lawmakers and 15 allies in left-wing and
Arab parties, Labor could have a majority of 65. It was not
immediately clear how Peres would attain the backing of 70 members.
   Thursday's vote was 60-55 against Shamir.

<HEAD>U.S. Rice Display Removed, Automakers Agree to Boost U.S.
Purchases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials removed a small amount of American
rice from an international food exhibition near Tokyo on Friday at
the request of the Japanese government, because the rice violated
Japanese trade law, officials said.
   Also Friday, two Japanese automakers pledged to boost their
purchases of American semiconductors after the U.S. commerce
secretary took his appeal for more balanced trade directly to
company executives.
   In an indication of the sensitive issue of Japan's trade surplus
with the United States, a dispute broke out in the Cabinet over
U.S. demands that Japan repeal a law that protects its small
businesses. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu cut off debate, and it was
unclear if the issue was resolved.
   One of the sponsors of the five-day food fair, Nobuo Ogawa,
executive vice president of the Japan Management Association, said
the American Trade Office ``recalled'' six types of U.S.-made rice
displayed at the U.S. Rice Council's booth.
   Food Agency officials said the display violates the Food Control
Law, which bans virtually all imports of rice for sale in Japan.
   Japanese rice is about four times more expensive than U.S. rice.
But the country insists on self-sufficiency in rice, its staple
food.
   ``We, as the organizers, were annoyed by the rice exhibit that
is in conflict with the Japanese law,'' Ogawa said.
   A U.S. Embasssy spokesman said there had been no public sampling
or tasting of the rice, which was ``displayed only to illustrate
the different varieties of rice available in the United States.''
   Officials at the Rice Council's booth and the American Trade
Office were not available for comment despite repeated telephone
calls.
   In 1988, both houses of Japan's Parliament unanimously adopted a
non-binding resolution against opening the nation's rice market to
foreign imports. It said rice production affects local communities,
the preservation of land and Japanese culture.
   Aout 900 companies and groups from 41 countries are
participating in the international food exhibition, ``Foodex,'' an
annual event in Chiba state 21 miles east of Tokyo.
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher spent four days in
Tokyo to follow up on talks two weeks ago between President Bush
and Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif.
   Mosbacher received ``very positive'' responses to his direct
appeal to executives from Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Matsushita, Sanyo,
Sharp, Victor, and Sony to buy more U.S. semiconductors, U.S.
officials said.
   The president of Honda Motor Co., Tadashi Kume, pledged his
company would buy 10 percent of its semiconductors from the United
States in 1991, said the assistant U.S. secretary for trade
development, Michael Skarzynski. That would be an increase from 1
percent last year.
   Toyota Motor Corp.'s president, Shoichiro Toyoda, said his
company would set a goal of buying 25 percent of its
general-purpose semiconductors from American manufacturers, the
officials said.
   Such high-volume general-purpose chips are generally less
profitable than custom-made semiconductors.
   In a 1986 semiconductor agreement, Japan and the United States
set a 20 percent goal for foreign chips in the Japanese market by
June 1991.
   U.S. officials say the figure was a commitment by Japan, while
Japanese officials say it was only a target. So far, Japanese firms
have boosted their foreign chip procurement to 12.9 percent from
8.6 percent in 1986.
   Skarzynski said ``U.S. executives also have to do their part''
to work for a higher market share.
   In recent trade talks, the U.S. government demanded that Japan
change aspects of its economy to help reduce its $49 billion trade
surplus.
   The Cabinet dispute Friday indicated that a consensus within the
government on trade issues has yet to be reached.
   The dispute, between the ministers of trade and home affairs, is
over how to handle U.S. demands that Japan review legislation
regulating large retail store openings. Under current law, Japan
protects small businesses by limiting where large stores are built.
   U.S. officials say an increase in large stores would boost sales
of imported goods because they generally stock more foreign
products than small stores.
   Home Affairs Minister Keiwa Okuda criticized the trade minister,
Kabun Muto, for proposing that the law only be modified. He told
the Cabinet that Japan should eliminate the law, a Home Affairs
Ministry official said.
   Kaifu cut short the discussion before Muto could respond, and
the three met afterward, the official said. It was not clear
whether the dispute was resolved.
   Cabinet disputes are seldom reported in the Japanese media, but
this one was covered prominently by television news.

   Lithuania's diplomatic representative to the
United States said Friday that Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has opened ``a little door'' that will lead to
negotiations on the future of his homeland despite the Kremlin's
rejection of independence.
   In an interview in the five-story mansion the Lithuanian
legation has continued to occupy throughout the Soviet occupation
of his homeland, Charge d'Affaires Stasyz Lozoraitis welcomed
Gorbachev's call for ``a respectful dialogue with the people of
Lithuania.''
   ``This is already a little door he is opening,'' Lozoraitis
said. ``It will take some time. It will take some pressure. But
with the help of the respectful dialogue we will go on and we will
try to convince Gorbachev.''
   The veteran diplomat said he believed the resolution passed
Thursday by the Soviet parliament invalidating Lithuania's
declaration of independence would have little effect.
   ``We had expected a rather harsh reaction,'' he said. ``What is
said publicly I don't think has a very great importance. Probably
something else is going on, and probably Mr. Gorbachev will
understand that there is no other way. We must sit down and
negotiate.''
   Lozoraitis said the negotiations should embrace the other Baltic
republics, Latvia and Estonia, which also have maintained legations
in the United States since their countries were swallowed up by
Josef Stalin in 1940 as part of the Nazi-Soviet pact.
   ``Gorbachev has accepted the idea that the Baltic states have
been illegally occupied, so the logical consequence should be that
he accepts the idea of these three states separating themselves,''
he said.
   Lithuania declared its independence March 11 and immediately
called for negotiations with Moscow, but Gorbachev said, ``We
cannot talk about negotiations. You carry out negotiations with a
foreign country.''
   The United States has never recognized the forced annexation of
the three republics, but has indicated it will not grant full
diplomatic recognition to Lithuania unless negotiations with Moscow
give it the attributes of a nation-state.
   ``It will be a tough negotiation,'' said Lazoraitis. ``Gorbachev
mentioned mutual, respectful dialogue. All right, I hope the
dialogue will really be respectful. We will not get violent. We
will not get disrespectful. We have shown we are a peaceful people.
When Gorbachev came to Lithuania, he could just walk in the streets
and nobody did anything to him although we don't like him very much
as long as he is in Lithuania, or his troops.''

   A colorful male pheasant darts into a
cornfield and several hens leave the grassy roadside ditch to fly
into the blue sky over Glenn Kingdon's farm, a model for wildlife
preservation.
   ``Five years ago, you wouldn't see a pheasant nowhere,'' Kingdon
said as he walked through rows of pine trees planted to protect the
birds and rows of corn left to feed them.
   ``It's a lot different now.''
   Now, he sees 75 to 100 pheasants on his 420-acre central
Illinois farm 40 miles east of Peoria _ and it didn't happen by
chance.
   Kingdon buys baby pheasants, raises and releases them to an
environment that includes both shelter and food. In addition to
planting trees and leaving a few rows of corn unharvested, he
limits mowing of roadside ditches and fence rows.
   He was one of 168 people honored under Successful Farming
magazine's ``Farming in the Flyways'' program for providing habitat
for waterfowl and wildlife within their agricultural operations.
   These farmers have established wetlands, planted windbreaks,
preserved virgin prairies and adopted other conservation practices
_ sometimes at their own expense and sometimes with government
financial help.
   ``Instead of mowing or burning, we preserve natural areas to
provide nesting spots for birds and small wildlife,'' said Cherrie
Anderson, who was among those honored.
   ``And, we plant sweetcorn and leave some sunflowers standing to
feed deer, raccoons, birds, whatever comes.''
   She and her husband, Bernard, of Warwick, N.D., farm 1,000 acres
near Devil's Lake, and devote about 300 acres in ``little pieces
here and there'' to geese and ducks and other wildlife.
   ``The main goal of Farming in the Flyways was to find out from
farmers themselves what wildlife conservation practices and
policies actually are working out on the land,'' said John Walter,
conservation editor for the Des Moines-based magazine.
   The program was announced a year ago, and farmers were invited
to send in descriptions of their conservation efforts. The magazine
selected winners, and profiles of the farmers with the best ideas
were published in the February issue.
   Two private conservation groups _ Ducks Unlimited Inc. and the
National Fish &amp; Wildlife Foundation _ and American Cyanamid, which
makes farm chemicals, cooperated in the program to provide awards
to the farmers.
   The top prize, an heirloom shotgun worth an estimated $7,000,
was presented to Ray McCormick of Vincennes, Ind., who floods a
112-acre grain field in the fall for waterfowl and plants soybeans
into standing wheat to encourage quail.
   ``It's one of the best examples of how to increase net return
while conserving soil, water and wildlife,'' McCormick said. The
``wheat cover crop makes excellent nesting habitat, while helping
control weeds and soil erosion.''
   Rick Van Etten of a Long Grove-based conservation group called
Ducks Unlimited said the flight index for waterfowl has dropped
from 100 million birds in the mid-1970s to about 65 million, as
land plowed for farming has replaced nesting areas for wildlife.
   Now, he said, some farmers are leading the effort to establish
and protect wildlife habitat.
   Kingdon, who estimates he spends less than $1,000 a year on his
pheasant program, said farmers need to change their practices if
they want to preserve wildlife for their grandchildren to enjoy.
   ``We tore out all the fences, the tree breaks and we mowed the
roadsides like front yards,'' he said. ``We brought this on
ourselves.''
   Mrs. Anderson said she and her husband have done ``common-sense
things'' and hope other farmers will follow their example.
   ``It's nothing expensive _ we don't have the money for that,''
she said. ``Farming in the Flyways publicized practical ideas that
anybody could use.''

   A Colombian military officer pleaded guilty Friday
in federal court to charges that he attempted to export of weapons
without a license.
   First Lt. Ricardo Petersson Bernal, 26, was arrested Sept. 28
when U.S. Customs Service agents found two semiautomatic rifles, a
9mm semiautomatic pistol, a 12-gauge shotgun, 1,000 rounds of
ammunition and a smoke grenade in his luggage checked for an
Avianca flight to Bogota, Colombia.
   Petersson said at an earlier hearing that he was taking the
weapons to Colombia for people who wanted them for their own
protection. A month before his arrest, the Colombian government
started a nationwide attack on drug cartels, triggering widespread
bombings, kidnappings and other violence by traffickers.
   Sentencing was not immediately scheduled. Petersson's attorney,
Milton Hirsch, said that under sentencing guidelines his client
probably would not get more than 10 months.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, issuing an appeal for peace in
Northern Ireland on the eve of St. Patrick's Day, said Friday that
there's ``no place for violence'' in that nation.
   The president made brief remarks on the continuing strife in
Northern Ireland as he received a bowl of shamrocks from visiting
Irish Deputy Prime Minister Brian Lenihan at a Rose Garden ceremony.
   ``There is one thing all of us here, all Americans, are united
in, and that is our desire for peace and tranquility in Northern
Ireland,'' Bush said.
   ``We can't forget the suffering and the tragedy that plagues St.
Patrick's Island and there's no place for violence in creating a
new future for Northern Ireland.''
   Lenihan presented the shamrocks to Bush, telling him ``the
shamrock itself, three leaves on one stem, is a symbol of unity _
the essential unity between the American and the Irish peoples that
has been celebrated in this manner since the time of the first
president of the United States, George Washington.''
   Bush, wearing a bright green tie and a gray suit, reached into
the bowl and scooped out a handful of shamrocks. He stuffed them
into in his breast pocket like a handkerchief.
   First lady Barbara Bush, wearing a green dress, also attended
the brief ceremony.
   ``Your children are making Ireland young again, creating hope
and opportunity for the future, rebuilding a strong economuy and a
peaceful existence,'' Bush told Lenihan. ``Here in the United
States, 43 million Americans are of Irish ancestry and I expect
many more wish that they were of Irish ancestry.''
   While Bush's ancestry is decidedly not Irish, he proclaimed:
``Once you've had a glass of Guiness with a man in Ireland, as I
have with Brian Lenihan, why, you're friends.''
   Bush's ancestors were among a small group of English Protestant
dissenters who lived in the Netherlands for more than a decade
before setting sail for America in the early 17th century.
   It was Bush's second St. Patrick's day event in as many days. On
Thursday, he joined 62 lawmakers in a St. Patrick's Day lunch in
the House of Representatives sponsored by House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash.

<HEAD>Genetic Testing May Determine Likelihood of Cancer Spread</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Genetic tests on women with breast cancer
could determine the risk of recurrence for some patients, improving
the chance of treating women generally thought to be safe, a
researcher said Friday.
   Cancer specialists also report that the use of lumpectomy and
radiation therapy appear to be promising alternatives to breast
removal for a common form of early breast cancer.
   The scientists' findings are being presented this week at the
American College of Radiology's 24th annual National Conference on
Breast Cancer.
   Genetic, or DNA, tests are run on some women, usually those with
large tumors, to reveal whether cells are dividing rapidly and the
cancer is expected to spread, said Dr. Eva Rubin, chief of the
mammography section at the University of Alabama in Birmingham.
   But a new study shows that similar genetic irregularities
indicating aggressive cancer show up in large and small tumors, a
finding that could signal doctors to begin additional treatment to
fight recurrence, Rubin said.
   Currently, women with small cancerous breast tumors that have
not spread to the lymph nodes have surgery or a lumpectomy with
radiation therapy, Rubin said. Most do not receive follow-up
chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. But 30 percent of those patients
later die from recurring cancer, she said.
   The Birmingham test was designed to determine if DNA test
results were different for larger tumors that can be felt, and
non-palpable cancerous tumors, she said.
   ``Of the 21 palpable and 24 non-palpable cancers we reviewed, we
found that DNA characteristics of small tumors are the same as
larger tumors,'' Rubin said.
   A DNA test on tissue taken in a biopsy can show if the cells are
rapidly dividing and if the DNA has more or fewer chromosomes than
the normal 46. If the tumor is growing and the DNA test is
abnormal, the patient's cancer is likely to be aggressive, Rubin
said.
   The study does not mean that all patients with breast cancer
should have the DNA test to find out whether the tumor is
aggressive, Rubin said, adding that more research and tests are
needed before recommendations are made.
   Yale University researchers, meanwhile, said they found that a
lumpectomy _ removing a cancerous tumor and some surrounding tissue
_ combined with radiation therapy can be a good alternative to a
mastectomy.
   Traditionally, the treatment for early cancer limited to the
ducts in the breast has been to remove the breast, said Dr. Bruce
Haffty of Yale's department of therapeutic radiology.
   But a study of 58 patients at New Haven Hospital shows a high
success rate using the less radical surgical procedure, he said.
Only three of the patients had recurring cancer.
   The women studied had received treatment from two to 10 years
earlier. The median follow-up time was four years after treatment.
   ``Though we feel it is highly unlikely we have compromised
patients in using this more conservative treatment, we will need to
follow them for 10 to 20 years,'' he said.
   If the cancer returns after a breast-saving lumpectomy is
performed, a mastectomy could still be an option, Haffty said.
   Some physicians are reluctant to use the breast-saving treatment
for early duct cancer, believing that the breast should be removed
if there is any chance that the cancer could recur.
   The Yale study so far does not bear out this concern, Haffty
said.
   ``A main message here is that it's important for women to be
screened by mammography so these tumors can be picked up earlier,
treated more conservatively and this will give the patient a much
better prognosis,'' he said.

   Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos
clutched the arm of her lawyer as she walked stoically into a
Manhattan courthouse today for a hearing about her racketeering
trial, which begins next week.
   Mrs. Marcos, with her head held high, walked up the steps of
U.S. District Court with attorney Gerald Spence. She did not speak
to the crowd of photographers and reporters that lined the steps.
   Once inside the courtroom, Mrs. Marcos sat at the defense table
with her lawyers. She wore a black dress with a black scarf around
her neck and held a black lace handkerchief.
   At the hearing, also attended by her co-defendant, Saudi
financier Adnan Khashoggi, lawyers discussed with U.S. District
Judge John Keenan procedures for jury selection starting Tuesday.
   Spence expressed concern about finding jurors who wouldn't have
preconceived opinions about Mrs. Marcos.
   ``Mrs. Marcos and her late husband have received much
unfavorable press,'' Spence said. ``She has been tried and
convicted in the press.''
   He asked that open-ended questions be posed to prospective
jurors about what they have read about Mrs. Marcos and their
attitudes about ``a reportedly wealthy, notorious world leader.''
   Keenan did not agree to any of the specific questions proposed
by Spence but assured him that he would conduct a through
examination of prospective jurors. ``I want a fair and impartial
jury,'' the judge said.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, arrived at LaGuardia Airport on Thursday on a
commercial flight from Honolulu, where she has lived since she and
her late husband left the Philippines after a popular revolt in
1986.
   Mrs. Marcos is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   The indictment says she helped in the illegal transfer of more
than $160 million allegedly embezzled from the Philippine treasury
to buy Manhattan real estate. It also accuses her of defrauding
$165 million from banking institutions to finance the properties.
   Khashoggi, who will be tried for mail fraud and obstruction of
justice, is accused of helping the Marcoses hide their ownership in
the properties through false documents.
   Ferdinand Marcos, who was the central figure in the October 1988
indictment, died Sept. 28 in exile in Hawaii. The traditional
mourning period in the Philippines, in which widows wear black, is
one year.

   When 12-year-old Michael Thiel, son
of a top Communist Party official, stood up for his father in
school recently, he was beaten up by classmates who broke his
glasses.
   It has been a long way down for the party that ruled East
Germany like a fiefdom for 40 years until its leaders were toppled
by a popular rebellion in the fall.
   ``There is a lot of hatred against the party, and the children
pick it up from their parents,'' said Michael's father Frank,
deputy chief of the Communist Party in Leipzig. The city is an
anti-communist stronghold where the protests that led to the
nationwide movement began.
   Nearly 2 million party faithful have fled the party since the
uprising. The 600,000 who remain have renamed themselves the Party
of Democratic Socialism and have frantically tried to convince
voters before Sunday's election that they have moved from dogma to
democracy.
   ``We no longer want to shape man in the image of socialism, we
want to create a kind of socialism that man can live with,'' said
the 38-year-old Thiel, a physics professor and party member for 20
years.
   But most East Germans have had enough after four decades of
secret police terror, corruption, travel restrictions and empty
store shelves. They are bitter about wasted lives in a drab society
that squashed all individual ambitions.
   ``We don't trust the Communists anymore,'' said Andreas Orlik, a
28-year-old plumber from Leipzig. Orlik stood in a crowd of 300,000
in the main Karl Marx Square, cheering West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and his promises of ``affluence for all'' in a united
Germany.
   Orlik said he would vote conservative in hopes that a
free-market economy will finally reward his hard work.
   ``For the past eight years I have lived in a damp apartment with
crumbling walls, and they wouldn't even let me install a bathtub
even though I'm a plumber,'' Orlik said. ``I worked overtime for
three years to buy a 17-year-old car on the black market for 10,000
marks ($1,960).''
   The average monthly salary is 1,100 marks, about $215.
   Such sentiments are shared by many East Germans. The most
optimistic forecasts say the revamped Communist Party will gain
only 18 percent of the vote Sunday.
   Party leaders are aware of their outcast status and acknowledged
that they expect to be relegated to the political hinterlands.
   ``A Strong Opposition for the Disadvantaged,'' read one campaign
poster in Leipzig.
   Thiel said the party's main objective in the new 400-Parliament
would be to block a reunification plan under which East Germany
would agree to adopt West Germany's constitution. Such a proposal
is backed by the conservative Alliance for Germany, a likely
coalition partner in a new government.
   ``We want to negotiate unification as a sovereign state, and not
simply be swallowed up by the West Germans,'' said Thiel. Other
leftist parties share this position, but even they have refused to
negotiate with the Democratic Socialists on a possible alliance in
Parliament.
   ``The PDS emerged from the Communist Party, and therefore the
other parties keep their distance,'' said Thiel. He said his main
reason for joining the Communists as a teen-ager was to ``belong.''
   The party is not only being shunned in the political arena.
Party members, accustomed to a privileged life under the old
regime, now face widespread hostility and even violent attacks.
Democratic Socialist volunteers have been beaten up, and windows of
campaign headquarters have been smashed.
   ``Today, I can't tell anybody that I'm in the party,'' said
Mathias Rulf, a Leipzig police officer patrolling in Karl Marx
Square. He said he was one of just a few party members left in the
once solidly communist police force.
   ``These are lawless times,'' muttered Rulf, in his 30's. He
watched the Kohl supporters waving West German flags and streaming
into the square for the rally.
   Party Chief Gregor Gysi has warned of a ``new intolerance,''
citing complaints by high school graduates that they are being
barred from university because of party membership. In the past,
party membership was a virtual prerequisite for admission to a
university or job advancement.
   Amid this atmosphere of hostility, the Democratic Socialists are
trying hard to show voters they are no longer a party run by dour
and dogmatic septuagenarians.
   In a publicity stunt, the 42-year-old Gysi performed a parachute
jump, the first in his life. He quipped afterward: ``You see from
above, how beautiful this country is, and that there is no reason
to just give it away.''
   The party's slogans are upbeat by East German standards,
borrowing freely from Western commercials. ``Don't worry - take
Gysi,'' said one.
   Thiel claimed the changes are not just cosmetic. Most old-time
functionaries have quit or been fired since the peaceful revolution
to make room for rank-and-file members with new ideas, he said. But
both Thiel and the party's top candidate in Leipzig, Dietmar
Keller, were already functionaries under the old regime.

   An administrator of humanitarian aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels pleaded guilty Friday to taking $93,000 in bribes
to help a New York businessman get $2.6 million in consulting
contracts.
   Donald F. Enos could be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison
and fined $279,000 for his guilty plea to two bribery counts in
U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va.
   Enos, deputy director of the Agency for International
Development's task force on Central American aid, admitted taking
the money since 1985 from George Kraus, owner of a New York-based
consulting company, according to court documents.
   No charges have been filed against Kraus, although he agreed
Feb. 12 to plead guilty to one count of bribery and cooperate with
the government investigation, according to court documents.
   Kraus has not appeared in court to formally enter his guilty
plea, said AID spokesman Jerry Lipson.
   Investigators videotaped Kraus handing Enos $2,000 in cash
during a Feb. 15 meeting the two men had in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
During the discussion that was secretly recorded by AID
investigators, the two men said the payment was part of a $33,000
bribe, according to court documents.
   In return for the bribe money, Enos arranged for Kraus
International Co. to obtain $2.6 million worth of contracts from
AID, court documents said.
   Those included a $600,000 management consulting contract for the
provision of health care to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Enos also admitted ``finagling'' the extension of a contract as
part of an arrangement to split the resulting $30,000 profit with
Kraus, according to the documents.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton scheduled sentencing for
May 25.
   Enos, of Reston, Va., was director of AID's Office of Human
Resources and Humanitarian Assistance from 1985-87. He then became
deputy director of the agency's Task Force for Humanitarian
Assistance for Central America.
   Enos agreed to cooperate with the government's continuing
investigation. He was placed on administrative leave with pay from
his $72,000-a-year job, AID said.
   The agency said it would take steps to dismiss Enos.

<HEAD>California Supreme Court Refuses To Halt Execution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court today rejected an
appeal to halt an execution that would be the first carried out by
California since 1967.
   Double murderer Robert Alton Harris, scheduled to be executed
April 3, can renew his appeal in federal court in San Diego.
   The state Supreme Court unanimously denied a hearing on new
evidence submitted by the defense about Harris' mental condition,
including a psychologist's diagnosis of organic brain damage. The
evidence also included a statement from Harris' brother, a key
prosecution witness at his trial, that Harris did not plan to rob
or kill his two victims.
   In papers filed with the court, Daniel Harris said his brother
was in a dazed state the day he fatally shot two San Diego
teen-agers, whose car he later used in a bank robbery.
   Defense lawyers also claimed Daniel Harris' confession about the
July 1978 crime was coerced and should have been barred as evidence
against his brother.

   It's perhaps the oldest cliche in the charity
business: Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; teach him to
fish, and you feed him forever.
   But the cliche took on a certain poignancy when Nina Belyaeva,
of the Soviet Union, used it Friday during a two-day international
conference on non-profit groups.
   Belyaeva, one of 400 participants from around the world, was
referring the new growth of the voluntary ``third sector'' in her
homeland, where state economic power is diminishing and private
industry encouraged.
   Belyaeva says her country's fledging grassroots organizations
must acquire Western technical expertise in philanthropy _ how to
raise funds, how to organize, how to network _ not necessarily
Western grants.
   ``What our independent sector needs now is to learn how to
fish,'' she said during a panel discussion that included
representatives from non-profit sectors in West Germany, Argentina,
Australia and Japan.
   ``All Eastern Europeans are saying that,'' said Virginia A.
Hodgkinson, vice president of research for Independent Sector, a
10-year-old non-profit coalition of 650 corporate, foundation and
voluntary organizations, which sponsored the conference.
   ``It makes a whole lot of sense,'' she said in an interview.
``If you suppress the voluntary sector, then only a certain few
people develop those skills. So what is necessary is to share
experiences and to have experiences.''
   Even for U.S. groups, long used to writing grant applications
and staging yearly fund-raising drives, contact with the world
non-profit community ``is a very self-renewing experience for all
of us,'' Hodgkinson said.
   The eighth annual conference brought in representatives from
organizations such as the Girl Scouts, environmental activists,
Bible studies societies and charitable arms of major corporations.
   Tadashi Yamamoto of the Japan Center for International Exchange
told a panel of his efforts to involve Japanese corporations in the
United States in philanthropic actions that go beyond public
relations.
   When the other panelists were asked if they would welcome
Japanese foundations operating in their countries, all answered yes.
   The panelists spoke of various frustrations in operating
charities in their countries, including encouraging government tax
deductions.
   ``In Argentina, there is a system of deductions for non-profit
organizations,'' said Andres Thomapson, of the National Council of
Scientific Research in Argentina. ``The trouble is, there isn't a
tax system.''

<TEXT>
   The government of East Germany has invited
international observers, including a team from the United States,
to monitor the national elections this Sunday, the State Department
announced on Friday.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the department's spokeswoman, said communist
Premier Hans Modrow accepted a suggestion made in Prague last month
by Secretary of State James A. Baker III to permit observers to
watch the election for a new 400-seat parliament.
   ``We commend this initiative of the German Democratic Republic
and hope other countries in the area holding elections in the next
few months will follow suit,'' said Tutwiler.
   She said the observers will come from the 34 members of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which was founded
to monitor compliance with the human rights provisions of the 1975
Helsinki accords which settled Europe's borders.
   Special passes will be issued to observers by the East German
government to facilitate access to polling sites across the country.
   The American observer team will consist of staff members at the
U.S. Embassy and six members of Congress.
   They lawmakers are: Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., a member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee; and Reps. John Bryant, D-Texas;
Jack Buechner, R-Mo.; Bill Richardson, D-N.M.: James Sensenbrenner
Jr., R-Wis.; and David Skaggs, D-Colo.
   About 12.3 million East Germans are eligible to vote in Sunday's
elections.

   A striking bus driver was charged
today with shooting a Greyhound bus after he was traced through a
videotape of pickets, police said.
   Roger D. Cawtra, 44, of Stratford was ordered held on $100,000
bond after he appeared in Superior Court in West Hartford. He was
arrested at his home at about 7:15 a.m. on charges of criminal
mischief, reckless endangerment and unlawful discharge of a firearm
in Monday's shooting on Interstate 84.
   His arrest was the first in more than a dozen shooting attacks
on Greyhound buses nationwide since the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions struck March 2, said company spokesman
George Gravely.
   ``I will not tolerate such acts,'' Judge Allen Smith said before
setting bond. The judge barred Cawtra from being within a mile of
any Greyhound bus terminals in Connecticut.
   Cawtra, who has driven for Greyhound for three years, has denied
knowing anything about the shooting, according to a police
affidavit.
   Cawtra was arrested in the shooting of a Greyhound bus Monday in
Farmington as it headed to Hartford from New York. The luggage
compartment was struck by a bullet fired from a passing vehicle.
None of the 19 passengers was injured.
   ``If that projectile had hit the wheel of the bus, we could have
had a tragedy,'' Smith said. ``When I heard of the incident, I was
appalled. I detest strike violence.''
   Cawtra was arrested after Carl F. Harris, who was driving the
bus that was shot Monday, watched a videotape of picketing
Greyhound workers, police said. Cawtra did not see his assailant's
face, but recognized his size, build and car on the tape, and a
.380-caliber casing was found on the floor of a car of the same
model rented by Cawtra, police said.
   When police told him about the casing, Cawtra told them he was a
gun dealer, the affidavit said. He turned over eight weapons to
police, including three semiautomatics, four revolvers and one
rifle. None of the weapons was .380-caliber, the affidavit said.
   Workers on the picket line at Hartford's Union Station Friday
expressed disbelief that Cawtra had been arrested, saying they
thought he was being used as a scapegoat.
   ``I just don't believe it,'' said Charles True, a Greyhound
driver for 17 years who said he has known Cawtra for three. ``He is
just going to be made a scapegoat to slow down the violence
nationwide. I don't know any Greyhound employee who would do
something like that.''
   The Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions represents
6,300 drivers and about 3,000 other workers.

   Terry Anderson's family and friends somberly
marked his fifth year as a captive in Lebanon today as President
Bush pledged to pursue ``all legitimate opportunities'' to win the
release of the hostages.
   ``I intend to keep open lines of communications with all
parties, including Iran, who have influence over hostage takers,''
the president said in a letter to Peggy Say, Anderson's sister.
   Mrs. Say met privately with Bush and his wife at the White
House, then addressed a ceremony across the street at Lafayette
Park. Directing her remarks to the captors of her brother thousands
of miles away, she said: ``You complain that your story has not
been told and yet the man who would tell it has been chained to a
basement wall for five years. ...
   ``I don't want to punish them. I don't want to hunt them down. I
just want my brother back. But I'm not going to pay them for doing
so,'' she said.
   Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, is the longest-held of the American hostages in
Lebanon. All told, 18 Westerners are believed to be captives there,
including eight Americans.
   Speaking at the sun-splashed ceremony, Louis D. Boccardi,
president and general manager of The Associated Press, said, ``At
this point the greatest gift we can give him is to press on, to not
falter, to find an honorable way to get the job done. If you know
Terry, that's what he's thinking, too.''
   Bush did not attend, but said in a radio interview that ``every
day I'm president I have a heavy heart when I think of the
hostages.''
   In an interview with National Public Radio, Bush called Mrs. Say
a ``courageous woman. ... She has suffered for five long years and
I just got to thinking that Barbara and I would like to hold her
hand and say, `Stay with it, you're courageous and we respect
you.'''
   In comments earlier to reporters Bush declined to say he was
optimistic that any hostages would be released soon.
   Others at the observance included Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y.; Dan Rather, CBS television anchorman; and the Rev. Lawrence
Martin Jenco, a former hostage who spent time locked up with
Anderson before his release in the summer of 1986.
   Rather described the gathering as one of ``remembrance and
love.'' While many Americans feel powerless about helping the
hostages, the ceremony was a symbol that ``we are doing at least a
little something. ... We will not rest until the hostages are
home,'' he said.
   In contrast with the day's spring-like weather, Anderson has
been held ``in terrible isolation'' and has endured brutality,
Rather said. Among other things he has not seen his daughter, who
was born after he was captured.
   Bush told reporters earlier in the day he would do ``everything
I can to get those hostages out of there.''
   Bush, viewing cherry blossoms along the Tidal Basin with his
wife, said the plight of the hostages ``concerns me every day I've
alive.''
   ``I don't want to get the hopes up through a lot of speculation
and have them dashed down,'' the president said. ``I respect the
families too much to do that.''
   No Greater Love, a Washington-based humanitarian organization,
sponsored today's ceremony, as it has other observances on behalf
of the hostages. The outdoor Washington ceremony was one of several
observances of the captvity suffered by Anderson and the other
hostages.
   In New York, Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass
at St. Patrick's Cathedral. In Tokyo, the Foreign Correspondents'
Club of Japan was holding a ceremony tonight to honor Anderson, who
was assigned to the AP Tokyo bureau from January 1977 to August
1981. Members of the club were to raise symbolically empty glasses
in a toast to Anderson, a salute that planners said also would be
made at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., and at the
Association de la Presse International in Brussels.
   In Beirut, local television stations planned to show a videotape
today of Anderson's 4-year-old daughter, Sulome, whom he has never
seen. The child shows off her ballet dancing and delivers a message
for her father and his captors, saying, ``I love you, Daddy, come
home. Please come home.''
   In his letter to Mrs. Say that decried Anderson's ``merciless
imprisonment,'' Bush said he continued to seek the immediate,
unconditional and safe release of the hostages.
   ``As a further signal of commitment to resolving this tragedy, I
intend to keep open lines of communications with all parties,
including Iran, who have influence over hostage takers. Please be
assured that your government will take advantage of all legitimate
opportunities to obtain the safe release of all of our hostages.''
   Separately, Vice President Dan Quayle said recent stories
suggesting the hostages might be freed were counterproductive. ``We
hope and pray they will be released,'' Quayle told reporters in his
office. ``I have no new information to shed.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We don't
have any breakthroughs we can report.''
   Said Bush: ``I'm going to do everything I can to get those
hostages out of there, sometimes privately, sometimes publicly.''
   Bush said he had not discussed the hostages with former
President Jimmy Carter, who recently met with officials in Syria to
try to get the captives freed. The president called Carter's visit
``unofficial.''
   In a letter published by seven Beirut newspapers, Sulome's
mother, Madeleine Bassil, told Anderson that she and the girl also
feel like hostages. ``We are in as much captivity, Terry, only our
living space is bigger here and it's shared by millions,'' she said.
   Anderson was kidnapped on a street in Beirut on March 16, 1985,
after playing an early-morning game of tennis. Since then, he has
been held in windowless rooms in the slums of Beirut, according to
other hostages. Sometimes he has been chained and blindfolded.
   During his five years as a hostage, Anderson's daughter has been
born and his father and brother have died.
   ``Who would have ever thought in their wildest nightmares that
this would last so long?'' asked Mrs. Say, who has traveled to the
Middle East and Europe trying to free her brother.

<HEAD>East Germans Prepare For First Free Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Political parties made their final campaign
pitches Friday, two days before East Germans elect their first
democratic parliament and complete the transition from 40 years of
Communist rule to a democracy.
   Sunday's first free vote in East German history could also be
the last as the two German states rush toward unification.
   Unification has been a central issue in the election, which was
forced on the government by last fall's peaceful rebellion that
ousted hard-line Communists, opened borders and led to the creation
of opposition parties.
   The makeup of East Germany's new 400-seat parliament could
decide the pace of unification. Some conservatives urge quick
unification, while some leftists favor a more cautious approach.
All major parties support unification.
   A nationwide survey published Friday suggested nearly half of
all East Germans favor immediate unification, although a third of
the electorate would prefer a slower joining of the two Germanys.
   The poll found that 84 percent favored unification in general,
according to a survey conducted jointly by the Central Institute
for Youth Research and the Institute for Market Research in Leipzig.
   The institutes did not say how many people were polled or list
the survey's margin of error.
   About 12.3 million East Germans are eligible to vote Sunday,
selecting from 24 parties and groupings. Parties include the
Communists, independent groups and those allied with West German
political parties. There's even the Beer Drinking Union, which
wants better ventilation in beer halls, an end to closing hours and
a lifting of strict drunken driving laws. They also don't want too
much ``thin'' foreign beer.
   The Communists ruled East Germany with an iron fist after the
country was founded in 1949 from the zone occupied by Soviet troops
in World War II.
   But the Communist leadership collapsed in October under popular
pressure and East Germany has been run since then by a broad
coalition caretaker government headed by Premier Hans Modrow, a
reform-minded Communist.
   The parliamentary election originally had been scheduled for
May, but with state authority collapsing rapidly, the ballot date
was moved up.
   Most political parties staged their final rallies across the
country on Friday, following a recommendation by East Germany's
election commission. But one or two parties planned rallies for
Saturday as well.
   Dozens of television networks from throughout Europe have set up
mobile satellite transmission stations in the parking lot in front
of the Parliament building in East Berlin to prepare for election
day.
   Campaign posters are all over East Berlin. One of them, put up
by a coalition of conservative parties, proclaims, ``Never Again
Socialism.''
   East German TV, freed from strict Communist control, has given
equal time to election spots by all parties and has interviewed the
candidates. Most East German newspapers are backed by political
parties and have supported their own candidates.
   According to recent polls, the front-runners are the leftist
Social Democrats and the Alliance for Germany, a coalition of three
conservative parties.
   The alliance has received campaign backing from West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is a Christian Democrat.
   The Social Democrats also have help from West German
politicians, who have taken to the road en masse to speak at
election rallies. The Bonn government poured in $11.8 million to
help major East German parties mount campaigns.
   The East German election is seen by many as a dress rehearsal
for West German elections in December and West German politicians
have worked hard to build up an East German base for the time when
unification comes.
   Kohl on Friday called East Germany's elections a ``destiny
vote'' on the road to German unification, and promised to protect
East Germans from hardship during their nation's economic overhaul.
   But as Kohl assured East Germans, West German states demanded an
immediate halt to special aid for East Germans resettling in the
West.
   Ernst Albrecht, the governor of Lower Saxony, said any future
East German resettler ``cannot expect that the states will keep a
made bed ready for him.''
   More than 130,000 East Germans have moved to West Germany this
year alone, joining more than 340,000 who came last year. The
exodus is bleeding East Germany's economy, and has seriously
burdened West Germany's social security net and job and housing
markets.

<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said Friday its outrage at Iraq's hanging
of a London-based journalist was not diminished by news of his
robbery conviction, but some lawmakers said it raises questions
about his background and whether he was a spy.
   ``The questions of any incidents in the past are irrelevant to
the charges he faced in Iraq,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman.
``Our dismay at the execution has been made quite clear by the
government and remains unchanged.''
   Iraqi president Saddam Hussein ignored international appeals for
clemency and ordered 31-year-old Farzad Bazoft hanged Thursday for
spying for Britain and Israel.
   Britain recalled its ambassador to Iraq, ordered all six Iraqi
military trainees out of Britain, and canceled ministerial visits.
It did not break diplomatic relations or impose economic sanctions.
   In Iraq, weekend demonstrations were planned to protest the
British measures, government-run newspapers said.
   The main demonstration will be Saturday outside the British
Embassy in downtown Baghdad, the papers said.
   The ruling Baath Party called on its hundreds of thousands of
members to participate.
   ``This poisoned campaign against Iraq cannot hide the dirtiest
type of politicial hypocrisy to undermine Iraq's lawful and sound
decision to hang Bazoft,'' the Baath newspaper Al-Thawra said.
   Condemnation was universal in the Iraqi press, with one
newspaper going so far as to claim Britain was an ally of Iran
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war so that it could regain
sovereignty over the region.
   Bazoft, a stateless Iranian, worked as a free-lance reporter for
the weekly Observer newspaper and traveled on British papers. He
said at his trial that his televised admission of spying was made
under duress.
   He told a British diplomat shortly before his execution that he
was just a journalist in search of a scoop when he went to the
Al-Iskandaria military complex south of Baghdad in September to
check reports of an explosion.
   Conservative Party lawmaker Rupert Allason, who writes on
espionage, said it was ``highly likely'' Bazoft was a spy for
Israel but ``highly unlikely'' he was working for British
intelligence, in view of his criminal record.
   ``I think that Bazoft knew that the moment his criminal
conviction became known to The Observer he would have been out on
his ear. He probably capitalized on the time he was there and his
background by offering himself to the Israelis,'' he said.
   Allason also claimed to reporters that Bazoft ``offered himself
four times to the British police in recent months as an informer.''
Scotland Yard made no comment.
   Observer editor Donald Trelford said: ``If Mr. Allason has a
single scrap of evidence that Farzad spied for anyone, let him
produce it. If not, he should keep his fevered speculation for his
books.''
   The mass-circulation Sun newspaper reported the robbery
conviction on its front page Friday, quoting unnamed security
sources.
   Bazoft, then a student, was sentenced to 18 months in prison at
the Crown Court at Northampton in central England in August 1981
for robbing a savings and loan office of $764. The prosecution said
he walked into the office and threatened to blow up the building.
He was carrying a fake bomb.
   The journalist's landlady, Penny Brain, said he robbed the money
to pay his rent. ``He robbed the building ... in the morning, paid
me what he owed me at lunchtime and shortly afterward the police
took him away,'' she recalled.
   Freed after a year with remission for good behavior, Bazoft won
an appeal against deportation on grounds his life would be in
danger in Iran.
   Conservative lawmaker Anthony Beaumont-Dark said: ``There now
arises an incredible story of mystery and enigma surrounding the
background of this fellow.''
   Beaumont-Dark said ``nothing alters the cruelty of the sentence
carried out by this inhuman regime.'' But he said it was ``highly
irresponsible'' of the Observer to send an Iranian-born journalist
to Iraq on such a dangerous assignment.
   Meanwhile, five opposition Labor Party lawmakers urged Britain
and the European Community to impose economic sanctions and an arms
embargo on Iraq, saying it has one of the world's worst human
rights records.
   British companies have lucrative contracts in Iraq, which is
rebuilding following the Persian Gulf war with Iran.
   The Foreign Office said Friday that Bazoft sent a final message
of apology to British nurse Daphne Parish, 53, who was sentenced to
15 years in prison for driving him to the military complex.
   Trelford said publication of the conviction and the allegation
that he spied ``obviously helps the Iraqis justify their bestial
act.''
   Michael Mifsud, a journalist and friend of Bazoft, claimed on
Independent Television News:
   ``Somebody, somewhere, is trying to tone down public reaction in
his favor for the purposes of maintaining a degree of stability in
the Iraq-U.K. situation.''

   Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood's
defense asked today to have the jury sequestered during
deliberations because of the upcoming anniversary of the tanker's
oil spill.
   ``This raises the fear of a mistrial if the jury is exposed to
demonstrations outside the courthouse,'' Attorney Dick Madson told
Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone.
   He added that jurors might be unable to avoid reading stories
and seeing television coverage next week marking one year since the
nation's largest oil spill.
   Johnstone said Alaska law provides that attorneys must ask for
sequestration before a jury is sworn in ``unless good cause is
shown.'' He said, ``You have not shown good cause, and I am going
to deny your application.''
   In a discussion about legal instructions to be given to the
jury, the judge said he would tell the panel members they may not
consider Hazelwood's alleged efforts to move his ship off a reef as
evidence of recklessness.
   He said testimony has shown clearly that it was impossible for
the ship to move and thus there was no risk under the law.
   He said, however, he would allow the prosecution to argue that
Hazelwood's efforts in turning on the engines and moving the ship's
rudder could be interpreted as evidence of his impairment by
alcohol. Closing arguments to the jury were scheduled for Tuesday.
   Hazelwood's lawyers rested their case Thursday without calling
him to testify in his criminal trial. Prosecutors also wrapped up
Thursday, setting the stage for final arguments next week after six
weeks of testimony over the grounding of Hazelwood's tanker on a
charted reef in Prince William Sound.
   With jurors out of the courtroom, Johnstone questioned Hazelwood
about whether he freely decided to give up his right to testify in
his own behalf.
   Hazelwood responded ``yes'' several times, but offered no
explanation.
   It had become apparent in recent days that Hazelwood's lawyers,
confident of their case, preferred not to expose him to possibly
long and grueling cross-examination.
   ``Capt. Hazelwood, you have a right to testify, and if you were
to testify you would be subject to cross-examination,'' Johnstone
said. ``Do you understand that right?''
   Hazelwood, seated at the counsel table, answered ``Yes.''
   ``Is it your desire at this time not to testify?'' asked the
judge.
   ``Yes,'' Hazelwood responded.
   It was the most the pensive, balding skipper has said in public
since his trial began.
   A defendant is never required to testify in his own behalf, and
jurors are instructed to infer nothing from a decision against
taking the stand.
   Hazelwood, 43, returned to Alaska from his home in Huntington,
N.Y., to stand trial on charges stemming from the March 24
grounding of the Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker which spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into waters rich
with fish and other marine life.
   Hazelwood is the only member of the ship's crew to face criminal
charges. He is accused of a felony, criminal mischief, and three
misdemeanors _ reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while
intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.
   If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 7\ years in
prison and fined $61,000.
   Key issues addressed by 46 prosecution and 15 defense witnesses
centered on whether Hazelwood was reckless before and after the
grounding.
   They were questioned about whether the captain seemed drunk,
whether he erred in leaving the ship's bridge in control of a third
mate and whether he tried a dangerous maneuver to drive the
stranded tanker off the reef.
   The latter claim appeared moot by the end of testimony through
defense witnesses who testified the gigantic ship was immovable.
Johnstone said he probably will instruct jurors they cannot
consider as reckless an attempt to do something that was impossible
_ move the ship.
   The last defense witnesses, a marine salvage master and a naval
architect, agreed the ship was stuck firmly on Bligh Reef.
   The final prosecution witness was Robert Mackintire, captain of
Texaco tanker The Brooklyn, which preceded the Exxon Valdez into
Prince William Sound several hours before the grounding.
   Mackintire testified he always remained on the bridge while
going through the sound, but on cross-examination added he did not
consider it a particularly difficult area to navigate.
   Hazelwood was in his cabin and a third mate was at the helm when
the Exxon Valdez ran aground.

<HEAD>ANC Leaders to Begin Talks With Government Next Month</HEAD>

   African National Congress
leaders exiled for decades will return home for groundbreaking
talks with the white minority government April 11, President F.W.
de Klerk announced Friday.
   Nelson Mandela, scheduled to arrive in South Africa on Saturday
after a five-nation tour, is expected to head the ANC delegation at
the discussions. They are designed to remove obstacles to formal
black-white negotiations on a new constitution.
   ``The meeting is structured to address those things which are
perceived to be stumbling blocks ... toward negotiations,'' de
Klerk told a Cape Town news conference after the announcement.
   He said some leaders of the ANC's military wing fear arrest upon
return to South Africa, and that could be one of the obstacles
discussed at the meeting.
   But de Klerk also said he hoped the ANC would drop its reference
to continued ``armed struggle'' so all leaders could commit
themselves to peaceful solutions.
   There was no immediate comment from the ANC, the main black
group fighting the white government. The Zambia-based organization
said last month it wanted to hold preliminary talks with de Klerk
``as soon as possible.''
   At a rally in Stockholm, Sweden, Mandela repeated ANC conditions
for formal negotiations with the South African government. The
conditions include lifting of the state of emergency, freeing of
all political prisoners, and repeal of repressive legislation.
   During Mandela's past week in Sweden, he and other ANC leaders
held extensive strategy discussions with ANC President Oliver
Tambo, who is recovering from a stroke in Stockholm.
   Mandela, 71, was elected deputy president of the ANC earlier
this month during a visit to Zambia. The position makes him the
effective leader of the organization while Tambo recuperates.
   The government has made clear that the ANC would be only one of
several black-led organizations it would invite to formal talks on
a new constitution.
   Among others are leaders of South Africa's 10 black homelands,
such as Mangosuthu Buthelezi, political leader of the Zulus.
   De Klerk has met with many black leaders in South Africa, and he
told reporters: ``It will not be my first meeting with the ANC.
I've already met Mr. Mandela twice.''
   The relatively conservative Buthelezi, a proponent of
capitalism, has long been at odds with the ANC over its use of
violence and support for economic sanctions against South Africa.
   ``De Klerk has, as state president, burnt the ruling National
Party's bridges behind him,'' said Buthelezi, who arrived for a
state visit in Lusaka, Zambia.
   ``Bold movements he has made into the new South Africa ... are
irretrievable commitments to abandon apartheid and to establish a
new and just social, economic and politcal order in South Africa,''
he said.
   De Klerk also said the government would spend $380 million more
this year to eliminate backlogs in black housing and education, and
purchase more land for settlement of blacks near the cities.
   An additional $760 million will form the basis of a trust fund
to be administered by the private sector. It will be used to
encourage donation from inside and outside South Africa to improve
blacks' living conditions and their opportunities for advancement.
   The ANC was banned in 1960, and many ANC leaders will make their
first trip to South Africa since going into exile three decades ago.
   The president legalized the ANC and more than 60 other
organizations Feb. 2. Nine days later he freed Mandela, who had
been imprisoned 27 years for helping launch the ANC sabotage
campaign.
   De Klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will
bring blacks into the national government, but allow whites to
maintain veto power over major policy decisions. De Klerk opposes a
one-person, one-vote system that the ANC and other leading
anti-apartheid groups demand.
   The ANC announced last month it would not open formal talks on a
new constitution until de Klerk lifts the state of emergency.
   De Klerk said Friday: ``I would hope the government's actions
and the influence of the total leadership in South Africa,
including the ANC, will bring about a situation which will enable
us to lift the state of emergency as soon as possible.''
   De Klerk and other Cabinet ministers said recently that some
black leaders were not ready to negotiate and were instigating a
wave of violence that has killed 300 blacks in the past six weeks.
   The violence is considered the worst since the mid-1980s, which
led the government to declare the state of emergency in June 1986.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Orders Briefs Filed in Flag-Burning Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday raised the
possibility it will decide by early summer the constitutionality of
a new law making it a crime to burn the American flag.
   The court partially granted a Bush administration request for
speedy consideration of the law, ordering challengers of the law to
file legal briefs by March 26.
   The justices will wait until they receive those briefs before
taking any further action in a pair of administration appeals to
overturn lower court rulings that the law unconstitutionally
stifles free speech.
   The Justice Department on Tuesday asked the high court to
expedite consideration of the politically charged issue and
schedule oral arguments as early as April 25.
   While the department and President Bush have expressed doubts
about the law's constitutionality, the administration filed legal
papers urging the court to uphold the statute.
   The department urged the high court to overturn rulings by two
judges, here and in Seattle, who declared the law unconstitutional.
   The judges ``overvalued ... the narrow category of expressive
conduct at stake and undervalued the compelling governmental
interest that lies at the core of the statute: the preservation of
the flag as the unique symbol of our nation,'' the department said.
   Conviction under the law carries a maximum one-year jail
sentence.
   The Justice Department acknowledged that Bush allowed the law to
be enacted Oct. 28 without his signature because he questions its
constitutionality and prefers a constitutional amendment to assure
the same protection for the flag.
   Bush said he has ``serious doubts (the law) can withstand
Supreme Court review'' and said ``a constitutional amendment is the
only way to ensure that our flag is protected from desecration.''
   David Cole, a lawyer representing the defendants in both flag
cases, accused the administration of seeking expedited high court
review so that flag burning will be an issue in this year's
campaign for House, Senate and state legislative seats.
   He urged the court to schedule arguments in the case when it
returns in October from its summer recess.
   ``This is a very important constitutional question. It shouldn't
be subject to political considerations,'' Cole said.
   The Supreme Court, voting 5-4 in June, struck down a Texas law
barring desecration or destruction of the flag. The court said
burning the American flag as a form of political protest is
protected by the Constitution's free speech guarantees.
   The high court's June ruling touched off a political firestorm
and led to enactment of the new flag-protection law.
   Democratic leaders in Congress supported the law as an
alternative to a constitutional amendment.
   The cases are U.S. vs. Eichman, 89-1433, and U.S. vs. Haggerty,
89-1434.

   When the white government and
the African National Congress meet, they face three issues that
could block the start of formal negotiations on a new constitution.
They are:
   _ The state of emergency. The ANC wants it lifted. President
F.W. de Klerk does too, but says he will not do so until violence
in black areas subsides. More than 300 blacks have been killed in
the past six weeks, most in factional fighting.
   _ Political prisoners. The ANC says several hundred members
convicted of politically motivated violence must be freed. The
government has refused, but has been speaking to the lawyers of the
prisoners. Also, the government has been vague on status of ANC
exiles suspected of violence. The exiles want guarantees they won't
be prosecuted if they return.
   _ Violence. The ANC still endorses its guerrilla campaign,
though it poses no threat to the government. The government says
there's no justification for armed resistance now that the ANC is a
legal organization.
   If agreement is reached on these obstacles, the government, the
ANC and several other black and white groups would likely begin
formal talks on a constitution that would grant political rights to
the 28-million black majority.
   Other major issues include:
   _ Apartheid laws. All black groups insist legislation
segregating schools, neighborhoods, hospitals and other facilities
be abolished. The government has said there will be changes, but so
far opposes a full repeal.
   _ Voting rights. Black groups want one-person, one-vote. The
government has said that would replace white domination with black
domination. Many whites want guarantees the rights of ``minority
groups'' will be protected. De Klerk envisions a system that gives
blacks voting rights, but allows whites to have veto power on major
policy decisions.
   _ Land. Blacks account for more than 75 percent of South
Africa's population but are restricted to 13 percent of the land.
Black groups demand land redistribution.

   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee
Atwater says the discovery of his benign brain tumor caused him to
tone down his pit-bull style of politicking.
   ``I can't imagine me getting back in a fighting mood ... I don't
see how I'm ever going to be mean,'' Atwater said in an interview
published in The State newspaper Friday.
   ``It's going to be hard for me to be as tough on people,'' said
Atwater, known for his aggressive style of politics and the
successful negative campaign he waged for President Bush in 1988.
   ``What I'm going to do is take a new approach to how I proceed,
because politics is people. I've always loved people. But I have a
better sense of humanity, a better sense of fellowship with people
than I've ever had before,'' he said Thursday from his car
telephone in Washington, D.C., on his way to the hospital for a
daily radiation treatment.
   Atwater collapsed while delivering a speech last week. Doctors
determined he had a non-malignant brain tumor. The 39-year-old
South Carolina native is undergoing radiation treatments to shrink
the olive-size growth.
   ``Forget money and power,'' Atwater said. ``I had no idea how
wonderful people are. I wish I had known this before. What a way to
have to find out.''

   Actress Delta Burke, whose weight gain was
fodder for supermarket tabloids, says putting on extra pounds was
her way of keeping people _ particularly men _ away.
   The star of television's ``Designing Woman'' says she was
molested when she was 4 and nearly raped while in her late teens.
As a result, she became ``absolutely terrified of men,'' she said
in US magazine's April 2 edition.
   ``I remember thinking that any guy walking towards me was gonna
attack me, he was gonna hurt me. And once I got older, I didn't
date. I would kind of hide from that,'' Burke said. ``The weight
was a buffer, because the attention I got when I was thinner was
too much.''
   Burke, who is married to ``Major Dad'' star Gerald McRaney,
controlled her weight for a while by taking diet pills and
amphetamines but began gaining pounds once she stopped. She's since
started battling back by going on a strict no-fat diet and working
out daily with a personal trainer.

   Ivana Trump has hired a Texas detective to work
on her divorce from her billionaire husband, Donald, according to a
published report.
   Clyde Wilson, a Houston private eye noted for investigating
murder cases and financial frauds among Texas' upper crust, has
been hired by Ivana's lawyers, according to Friday's editions of
New York Newsday.
   One unidentified source told Newsday that Wilson was hired
before news of the divorce became public. That source added that
Donald's considerable clout in New York led them to hiring a
detective agency outside the city.
   Wilson's agency is to gather evidence of any possible infidelity
on Donald's part, as well as document Ivana's contributions to the
growth of the Trump empire, the newspaper said.
   Wilson and Michael Kennedy, Ivana's lawyer, refused to confirm
or deny that the private eye was working on the Trump divorce,
Newsday said.
   Jay Goldberg, one of Trump's lawyers, said hiring a detective
was like grasping at straws in view of the prenuptial deal.
   ``It's a feather trying to knock down a steel door,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Congressional Seats at Stake in Special Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A candidate for a Bronx congressional seat lives
in Queens. The front-runner in a Staten Island race is trying to
fill her father's shoes _ or at least his congressional seat.
   There are plenty of quirks in the campaign for two vacant
congressional seats in New York City's boroughs to be resolved in a
special election Tuesday. But when the last vote is counted, no
surprises are expected.
   Republicans will likely hold onto the 14th District seat, which
covers Staten Island and a sliver of Brooklyn, and Democrats are
predicted to keep the seat in the 18th District, covering the
impoverished south Bronx.
   Gary Koops, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional
Committee, admitted it would be tough to win the Bronx seat, a
longtime Democratic stronghold. Democratic Assemblyman Jose Serrano
is the favorite.
   It also doesn't help that the Republican candidate, a former
Democrat, is considered an outsider _ literally.
   Simeon Golar lives in Queens, and though candidates are not
required to live in the districts they seek to represent, ``that
can be a factor'' for many voters, Koops said.
   Also on the ballot is Ismael Betancourt, running on the
Independent Fusion and Right-to-Life Party lines. The seat became
vacant when Rep. Robert Garcia was sentenced to three years in
prison for extorting payoffs in the Wedtech scandal.
   In the Staten Island race, Democrats are not racing to stencil
the name of their candidate, Robert Gigante, on the door of an
office in the Capitol.
   ``I'm optimistic we have a good chance to make this a very close
race,'' says Howard Schloss of the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee in Washington. But, he quickly added, ``that's
not to say we're going to win.''
   Gigante, 41, is an attorney and virtual unknown facing City
Council member Susan Molinari, whose father resigned from Congress
in the middle of his fifth term to become Staten Island borough
president. Many say Guy V. Molinari quit Congress to open the way
for his only child.
   His 31-year-old daughter got a boost both media- and money-wise
when President Bush visited Staten Island for a fund-raising
luncheon that put an extra $223,000 into her campaign coffer. Her
father ran Bush's 1988 campaign in New York.
   Gigante, who is running a distant second despite a 2-to-1
Democratic registration edge, has trashed his opponent for
``looking like a little girl at the podium.''
   ``If that's the best issue Gigante's got, then I hope he has a
strong law practice,'' Koops said.
   Others running in the 14th District include Carl Grillo on the
Liberal line and Right-to-Life candidate Barbara Bollaert.
   Analyst Charles Cook, whose Cook Political Report handicaps
congressional races for corporations, trade and union groups,
snored loudly when asked to give his opinion of the two races.
   He says he hasn't even looked at the Bronx race because ``I just
assume Serrano is going to catch it.''
   Serrano spokesman Carol Pasco said the Bronx Republican
Committee chose Golar, a former family court judge and ex-city
commissioner of housing and human rights, because he is black.
   ``I think the strategy is fairly obvious,'' he said. The 18th
District population is evenly split between blacks and Hispanics.
   In Staten Island, Cook says, Gigante is ``every bit as effective
a candidate'' as Molinari, but he ``doesn't have the necessary
resources _ i.e. money and support _ to pull it off.''
   Molinari is expected to raise about $400,000 for the special
election; Gigante is likely to bring in about $225,000. Gov. Mario
Cuomo and New York Mayor David Dinkins have endorsed Gigante but
neither has actively campaigned with him.
   If elected, Molinari would be the youngest sitting member of
Congress. She has been the only Republican on the 35-member City
Council, the legislative body that governs New York, since her
election in 1985.

   Housing starts fell 7 percent in February but
remained well above the level of the last 11 months of 1989, the
government reported Friday. Analysts said the building pace cannot
be sustained.
   New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.48 million units in February, the Commerce
Department said.
   That followed a 24.7 percent jump in the warmest January on
record, the biggest increase since a 29.3 percent gain in July 1982
despite being revised down from a 29.6 percent advance first
reported last month.
   Temperatures remained above normal in February and although
housing starts fell from January's 1.59 million-unit level, they
remained higher than those of any month last year except for the
1.66 million units started in January 1989.
   ``The pace of activity in January and February is higher than we
can expect over the course of the year,'' said Thomas Holloway,
senior economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``We're
probably borrowing a few starts from later in the year because of
the warmer weather.''
   The increase in new construction was based entirely in the
single-family sector, which rose 5.1 percent to an annual rate of
1.17 million units. It was the highest level since a 1.19
million-unit rate in January 1989.
   ``The fact that single-family starts were up in February bodes
well for activity in the coming months as (mortgage interest) rates
head downward,'' said John A. Tuccillo, chief economist at the
National Association of Realtors.
   Multifamily starts plummeted 35 percent to an annual rate of
266,000 after rising 40 percent the previous month.
   Analysts said the January pace resulted both from the weather
and from builders' desire to get construction underway in advance
of new regulations designed to make apartments more accessible to
the handicapped.
   The new ``fair housing'' rules could add $3,000 to the cost of
multifamily units, said David Seiders, chief economist for the
National Association of Home Builders.
   David Berson, chief economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, said a high vacancy rate also contributed to the
multifamily weakness.
   ``It's almost certain to remain weak until vacancy rates come
down,'' Berson said.
   The Northeast posted the biggest gain in overall starts, up 24.4
percent to an annual rate of 219,000 units. It was followed by a
14.8 percent jump in the South to 604,000 units.
   Starts in the Midwest declined 29 percent to an annual rate of
271,000 units and in the West fell 24 percent to 383,000 units.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, fell 25 percent after a 26.8 percent gain in January. The
decline was the largest on record.

<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello on
Friday implemented a sweeping emergency package of economic reforms
that include a price freeze, a new national currency, and jail
terms for ``economic crimes.''
   ``Brazilians want serious action now,'' said Collor de Mello as
he announced his plans. The new president took office Thursday. He
is Brazil's first popularly elected leader in 29 years.
   Brazil has the developing world's largest foreign debt, $114
billion. Inflation is 2,700 percent, and the budget deficit is $31
billion. Millions of people live on the street or in shantytowns.
   At the same time, the country has the world's eighth-largest
economy and the Western world's third-biggest trade surplus.
   Collor de Mello took office saying he would try to correct these
imbalances.
   The reform package takes effect immediately but must be approved
by Congress within 30 days. If Congress fails to vote, Collor de
Mello can reissue the measures for another 30 days.
   Under the emergency measures, prices will be frozen 30 days and
wages controlled. Inflation for March is expected to total 85
percent but to help lower the rate, workers will get a raise for
the month equal to February's inflation, which was 73 percent.
   On April 15, when the price freeze ends, wages and prices will
be ``pre-fixed'' by a government-set amount. TV Globo, Brazil's
largest commercial network, reported the salary and price hikes
would be 40 percent in April and 20 percent in May.
   ``The violence of inflation and runaway prices has made
indispensable directed parameters for prices and salaries,'' said
Collor de Mello.
   Collor de Mello said the measures would result in the
``weakening of speculation and the strengthening of investment.''
   The new conservative president also announced a new currency,
the ``cruzeiro,'' which replaces the 14-month-old new cruzado. The
``cruzeiro'' is Brazil's fourth currency in as many years.
   Private economists said it would be created by lopping two zeros
off the new cruzado, which is now worth about 2.5 cents.
   Collor de Mello declared a new law against ``economic abuses,''
such as withholding goods from the market, financial speculation
and illegal price hikes.
   ``Who tries to cheat and fool the people will be jailed,'' he
said, adding that store owners and managers found guilty of
economic crimes will face five-year jail terms.
   The most contoversial part of Collor de Mello's annoucement
centered around his promise to balance the budget deficit this
year. Promised new measures included:
   _ Major new taxes on the wealthy and on financial gains from
trading in stocks and gold.
   _ The suspension of $2.2 billion in annual federal subsidies to
private enterprise, that go to everyone from exporters to the
computer industry.
   _ An ``ambitious program'' of privatizations of state-owned
companies. Brazil has 188 publicly owned firms. Many operate at a
loss and they have total debts of about $62 billion.
   _ Stiff increases in public utility rates, such as electricity
and telephone.
   _ Firings of large numbers of Brazil's 700,000 federal employees.
   ``This year's federal deficit will be zero ... There's no way to
knock down inflation if the government spends more than it takes
in,'' Collor de Mello said.
   Collor de Mello also said he wanted to integrate Brazil's
economy into the world market, eliminate import restrictions and
bring foreign capital to the country.
   ``We will modernize our economy and stimulate competition ...
Free initiative is the only way to sustained and progressive
growth'' he said.
   Collor de Mello signed laws Thursday that reduced the number of
government ministries from 25 to 12 and ordered the sale of
government-owned mansions and cars.
   Also decreed was the extinction of 24 federal agencies and
companies, including the Brazilian Institute of Coffee, which
controls all coffee trade, and the government's port authority,
Portobras.
   Initial reactions to Collor de Mello's package were mixed.
   ``We've worked all our lives for reforms like a balanced budget.
Halelujah!,'' said right-wing Senator Jarbas Passarinho of the
Social Democracy Party.
   Union leaders were mostly negative.
   ``I'm still analyzing the package but my sensation is that
workers have lost. If he wants to take on the banks, fine, but
we've got nothing else to give,'' said Luis Antonio Medeiros,
president of the powerful Sao Paulo-based Metalworkers Union.
Medeiros supported Collor de Mello in last year's presidential
campaign.
   Collor de Mello was inaugurated for a five-year term Thursday.
He replaced Jose Sarney, who took office in an Electoral College
vote set up by the right-wing military regime that ruled Brazil
between 1964 and 1985.

<HEAD>Cuban Communist Party Calls Fourth Party Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuba's first Communist Party congress in four
years will allow some debate but will not challenge the party's
31-year monopoly on power, the state news agency said.
   Prensa Latina said the announcement of the congress, to be held
next year, was made by Defense Minister Raul Castro, the brother of
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   The report came Thursday, the same day Vice President Dan Quayle
appealed to other countries to urge the Havana government to hold
free elections.
   Castro repeatedly has rejected Western-style balloting and said
his country has no need for Soviet-style reform _ despite pressure
from Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a drop in Soviet aid.
   The party congress will be held in the first half of next year,
the dispatch said, without giving the exact date. The report was
monitored in Mexico City.
   The party said the meeting would not exhibit ``unreal eagerness
of unanimity _ false, mechanical and formal.''
   However, the party, which seized power in a 1959 revolution,
made clear its intention to retain full control of the Caribbean
island.
   ``Our Communist Party, the base of political organization in our
society, is perfecting itself to better complete its work of
historical transcendence that we are setting up today,'' it said.
   When the government announced in February that a party congress
would be called, there was speculation that the move might signal a
change in course for the hard-line Marxist government.
   Since then, however, Castro has said he intends to remain
staunchly loyal to Marxist principles.
   Quayle and Castro, both in Brazil on Thursday for the
inauguration of President Fernando Collor de Mello, stayed clear of
each other but debated through the media.
   ``We have encouraged all people who have any contact with Fidel
Castro to urge him to stop the war in El Salvador, to stop
funding'' the well-organized guerilla movement,'' Quayle told a
news conference Thursday.
   ``We also urge anyone who is in contact with Castro to ask him
when he's going to have elections,'' said Quayle.
   Castro said Wednesday he saw no need for Western-style elections
in Cuba. Congresses of the ruling Communist Party choose Cuba's
leadership.
   ``We have our own type of election,'' he said in an interview
with TV Globo, Brazil's largest network. ``It would take long to
explain our (political) process.''
   Castro has faced growing international criticism of his human
rights policies and increasing pressure to reform. In three months
he lost his two closest Caribbean allies _ Panama's Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who was toppled in a U.S. invasion in December, and
Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistas, who were defeated by a U.S.-backed
opposition coalition in elections Feb. 25.
   As criticisms of Cuba have appeared in official Soviet media,
Castro has called on Cubans to brace for possible cuts in the
Soviets' $5 billion in yearly aid.
   U.S. sources said last year said there had been substantial
reductions already, as evidenced in the marked decline in the
purchase of sugar, which the Soviet Union buys from Cuba at prices
substantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy.

   Paul Steinle resigned as president of United
Press International Friday, a little more than two years after
taking over day-to-day operation of the news service.
   UPI Chairman Earl W. Brian said Steinle, 51, is leaving to form
a broadcast production company, Steinle Communications. He will
serve as a consultant to UPI during the transition to new
leadership, Brian said.
   Brian said Joseph K. Taussig, vice chairman of the news service,
would assume the duties of president until a permanent successor is
named.
   Steinle became president of UPI in February, 1988, at a time
when the wire service, now 83 years old, had been losing $2 million
a month.
   Before coming to UPI, he was president of Financial News
Network. He will remain on the board of that organization and of
UPI, Brian said. Both UPI and FNN are owned by Infotechnology Inc.,
an information and communications company.
   Brian said Steinle made ``vital contributions to restoring UPI's
financial stability and employe morale'' and directed restructuring
of UPI operations. During his tenure, a number of individual
business units were created within the news service.
   Steinle said his new company will provide program development
and production services, with emphasis on news and information
programming, for media and videocasette markets. Brian said
Infotech plans to invest in the company.
   In a farewell message to UPI employees, Steinle said that in the
last two years the news agency ``has been restored to stability.
Through team effort a valuable journalistic tradition has been
preserved and strengthened.''

   An earthquake shook the Baja California

no injuries or damage, residents said.
   The Tacubaya seismological station in Mexico City said the quake
measured 5.6 on the Richter scale and was centered about 75 miles
northeast of La Paz.
   ``It moved the tables. Everything moved. The windows rattled. It
felt like something was hitting the house,'' said Alfonso Sepulveda
Valenzuela. ``We thought a car had hit a post.''
   But Sepulveda and other residents said they saw no broken glass
or other damage in downtown La Paz. The city is about 800 miles
southeast of San Diego.
   Jose Alberto Cesena, private secretary to the mayor, said no one
in his office felt the quake and he heard no reports of it from
other residents or local news media.
   Gonzalo Carreno Avitia, a Red Cross employee in La Paz, said
there were no calls about the quake.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one whole number means a tenfold
increase in magnitude. An earthquake measuring five on the scale
can cause considerable damage and one of six, severe damage.

<HEAD>Cost Estimate for New Air-to-Air Missile Up 21 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation and a revision in the Pentagon's
cost-estimating system have pushed the price of the next generation
of air-to-air missiles to more than $14 billion, Air Force
officials told Congress on Friday.
   The new estimate is 21 percent higher than the previous
calculation.
   Lt. Gen. Ronald W. Yates also told the House Armed Services
procurement subcommittee that the Air Force has suspended delivery
of the AMRAAM missile because of problems with some of the 140
missiles it has accepted for testing.
   ``Most of the discrepancies fall into the category of quality,
workmanship-type issues or process changes at the contractors,''
Yates said.
   Raytheon and Hughes manufacture the missile.
   The AMRAAM, which has been in development since 1981, is
considered a ``smart missile.''
   The Pentagon envisions that a fighter pilot would use radar to
detect enemy aircraft at long distances and fire the 12-foot
missile. The AMRAAM would then use its own radar to hit the enemy
missile.
   The program, however, has had problems with cost overruns.
   Yates said the original cap imposed by Congress on the program
in 1984 was $7 billion, but that limit was later revised to $7.5
billion and then $7.7 billion.
   Adjusted for 1984 prices, the new estimate of $14.37 billion for
the 24,335 missiles the Pentagon has planned to purchase would be
$9.3 billion _ 21 percent more than the last estimate.
   The assistant Air Force secretary for acquisition, John J.
Welch, said a fourth of the increased cost is due to higher prices
for components and the rest stems from the Defense Department's
change in its estimating methods.
   Yates also said that the Air Force is reexamining the total
number of missiles it plans to buy in light of the diminshing
Soviet threat.
   The Air Force is responsible for development and overseeing
production of the AMRAAM, but the Navy plans to purchase it as well.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
venturing into his first round of on-site African diplomacy, will
urge South African President F.W. de Klerk next week to end a
3{-year state of emergency and to release all remaining political
prisoners.
   As Baker's trip was announced Friday by the State Department,
the de Klerk government said it would begin negotiations with
Nelson Mandela and exiled leaders of the African National Congress
on April 11.
   A senior U.S. official said Baker hopes to accelerate the
negotiations, but ruled out demands by Mandela for stiffer U.S.
sanctions against South Africa as a pressure tactic. ``It is time
for us to encourage them, not punish them,'' the official said,
referring to de Klerk's release of Mandela from prison last month
and the president's willingness to negotiate with the black
opposition.
   But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
Baker would urge de Klerk to end the state of emergency in South
Africa and free political prisoners, estimated by his critics to
number nearly 300.
   Baker will leave Sunday for Namibia, the newly independent
former South African colony where the secretary and other world
figures will attend ceremonies for the new nation.
   The United States, during the Reagan administration, played a
leading role in the establishment of Namibia and is prepared to
provide $7.8 million in aid next year.
   While at the celebration, Baker will meet with Mandela, whose
demand for stiffer sanctions and a suspension of U.S. diplomatic
relations with South Africa is being rejected as counterproductive.
The Bush administration prefers dealing with Pretoria as a way to
try to shape events in the racially segregated country, arguing
that a cutoff and a tougher stance would limit U.S. leverage.
   In Namibia, Baker also will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   Before leaving for Capetown to see de Klerk, Anglican Bishop
Desmond Tutu and black opposition leaders, Baker will open talks
with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in an effort to end
his government's 14-year war with U.S.-armed guerrillas.
   The secretary will then see Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita
rebels, who receive an estimated $45 million to $50 million in
covert U.S. aid.
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Angola, but a
virtual stalemate in the war since December may improve prospects
for a negotiated settlement and U.S. recognition.
   The United States is alone among major Western countries in not
recognizing the Angolan government.

<HEAD>Argentine Officer Convicted in Absentia For Murder of French Nuns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Argentine navy officer was convicted in absentia
Friday for the abduction and murder of two French nuns killed in
Argentina 12 years ago.
   French legal experts said it was the first time someone had been
convicted of a crime outside of his own country after having been
granted amnesty in his homeland.
   On trial was Capt. Alfredo Astiz, 40, commander of a warship in
Argentina, and scheduled for promotion. Known to human rights
groups as ``the angel of death,'' he was sentenced to life in
prison after a hearing in a Paris criminal court that lasted less
than four hours.
   The court, in a symbolic gesture, also ordered the sequestration
of all of Astiz's property.
   Astiz in the past has denied any connection with the crime.
   Along with all other junior officers in Argentina, he was
exempted in 1987 from prosecution for any human rights violations
committed during the ``dirty war'' waged against leftists by a
military junta. President Raul Alfonsin, seeking to consolidate
civilian rule with conciliatory gestures, said only senior military
commanders should be held accountable.
   The nuns' relatives and their lawyers do not expect Argentina to
extradite Astiz. But they said a conviction might prompt other
countries to recognize an international arrest warrant on Astiz.
That could in effect make Astiz a prisoner of his own country.
   The bodies of the two Roman Catholic nuns, Alice Domon and
Leonie Duquet, were found on a beach near Buenos Aires two months
after they were abducted in December 1977.
   Astiz, who had been captain of a navy frigate, was assigned at
the time to infiltrate organizations that had taken up the cause of
victims of the junta's repression.
   According to papers filed in the French court, Astiz ordered the
abduction of the nuns, who had befriended anti-government
activists. He later was implicated by an activist who escaped
custody.
   Lawyers representing the nuns' families say they hold Astiz
responsible for torture the two women allegedly underwent shortly
after abduction.
   In the courtroom Friday were two women who said they had
belonged to an organization of mothers of the ``disappeared'' in
Argentina. They wore the group's traditional white scarves.
   In 1978 Astiz served briefly with the Argentine Embassy in Paris
under an assumed name.
   The nuns' families filed charges against Astiz in 1982, and an
arrest warrant was issued. France unsuccessfully sought his
extradition from Britain, where he was taken as a prisoner after
his capture during the Falkland Islands war.
   He was indicted in Argentina for the January 1977 arrest and
disappearance of Swedish teen-ager Dagmar Hagelin, but freed from
prosecution in December 1986 by a federal court that invoked the
statute of limitations.
   Alice Doman, 40 at the time of her death, was sent to Argentina
in 1967. She worked for a time in a Buenos Aires shantytown and
later in an impoverished northern village before returning to the
capital in 1976. She was abducted while leaving a church following
a meeting with parents of missing activists.
   Leonie Duquet, 61 at the time of her death, had worked in
Argentina since shortly after World War II. Her brother, Eribert,
is a Roman Catholic priest who was posted in San Francisco at the
time of her abduction.
   Astiz is stationed at the Puerto Belgrano navy base, about 460
miles south of Buenos Aires on the south Atlantic. The base is
Argentina's largest.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Plan Under Fire From Labor Group, Moyhnihan</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to balance the budget by raising taxes
and freezing Social Security benefits was attacked Friday by a
labor-financed group as unfair to low- and middle-income Americans.
   The plan by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, ``looks a lot like what (President) Bush
campaigned on,'' said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax
Justice.
   McIntyre, whose organization has produced some widely read
analyses of the tax system, outlined what he said would be fairer
way to reduce the deficit. The central element in McIntyre's plan
would raise the top individual and corporate tax rates to 38
percent, up from 33 percent and 34 percent, respectively.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., also criticized
Rostenkowski's plan Friday because it would continue to the use of
surplus Social Security taxes to hide the real size of the overall
federal deficit.
   ``This is not government money,'' Moynihan said. ``This money
belongs to the contributors'' _ meaning the workers whose payroll
taxes finance Social Security.
   Moynihan has proposed eliminating the surplus by cutting Social
Security taxes.
   Moynihan also faulted Rostenkowski for calling on retirees to
give up their scheduled Social Security cost-of-living increase in
1991. ``This is the first time I have heard such a proposal made
from our (Democratic) side on a unilateral basis,'' Moynihan said.
   He said that although the freeze would be for only one year, the
failure to pay the increase would permanently reduce retiree's
benefits.
   Moynihan's staff calculated that in 1991, the freeze would cost
a typical couple retiring this year at age 65 about $588. Over five
years the loss would total $3,192.
   Citizens for Tax Justice says Rostenkowski's plan is flawed
because ``it's asking the wrong people to pay'' for the deficit.
   The organization's substitute proposal would raise individual
taxes by $139 billion over the next five years and corporate income
taxes by $178 billion. Another $195 billion for deficit reduction
would come from reducing the defense budget and $62 billion would
be derived from cutting government interest payments.
   ``All but the richest 5 percent of American families'' would
fare better compared with Rostenkowski's plan, McIntyre said.
   Rostenkowski would eliminate the lingering deficit by
eliminating cost-of-living raises for Social Security beneficiaries
and recipients of many other government programs. It would also
raise income taxes on everybody who files a return, with an
especially big boost on the richest 600,000 people, and raise taxes
on gasoline, cigarettes, wine and beer.
   Bush has said there is room for discussion in Rostenkowski's
plan but repeated his opposition to any tax increase.

<HEAD>Nepal's King Says He Will Consider Democratic Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Birendra said Friday he would
consider political reforms in this Himalayan kingdom, but he ruled
out the multiparty system that protesters have demanded.
   Police arrested about 150 people, including prominent writers
and entertainers, in one of the largest mass arrests of
demonstrators since the movement for a return to democracy was
launched Feb. 18, witnesses said.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with Western-style democracy ended
in 1961 when King Mahendra, Birendra's father, dismissed the
government headed by the Nepali Congress party. The king accused
the party of corruption and banned all political parties.
   The National Assembly now shares power with the monarch.
   Birendra, a 44-year-old Harvard graduate, spoke at a rally in
the resort city of Pokhara, 85 miles northwest of Katmandu. His
speech marked his first public comments on the month-long campaign
of protests and strikes in Nepal. At least 12 people have died in
the unrest.
   ``We have instituted reforms as called for by the changing needs
of time,'' the king said in an address broadcast by state-owned
radio. ``Taking into account the Nepalese aspirations, this process
will continue.''
   But he said there would be no change in the decree banning
political parties.
   The king said the ban was upheld in a 1980 national referendum
and ``our political tradition relies on the popular will.''
   He lashed out at the protest movement and said there could be no
solutions when ``there is irresponsible behavior and undignified
acts disregarding the interest of the country and people.''
   The Nepali Congress said Birendra's speech was ``politically
most disappointing.''
   ``Indications of reform ... in the royal address cannot solve
the real problems of the nation,'' the party said in a statement.
   Under the current system, the king nominates one-fifth of the
National Assembly's 140 members and wields considerable influence
in the selection of top officials and the formulation and
implementation of government policy.
   The rest of the assembly's members are elected on a non-party
basis.
   Riot police broke up a silent protest Friday at Patan College on
the outskirts of Katmandu.
   The protesters wore black cloth over their mouths to demonstrate
their resentment of the government's efforts to silence their
demands. They distributed statements accusing the government of
arresting more than 50 writers and artists, in addition to other
protesters, ``during the recent crackdown on innocent and unarmed
people.''
   Witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity said some of the
protesters were beaten as police dragged them away.
   Those arrested included a 79-year-old poet, a popular comedy duo
and a partially paralyzed novelist, Parijat, who was helped to a
police van by fellow demonstrators, the witnesses said.

   President Bush on Friday put New York
investment executive John P. Birkelund in charge of managing U.S.
aid to Poland and named former deputy Secretary of State John
Whitehead to a similar post for aid to Hungary.
   Birkelund, chief executive officer of Dillon, Read &amp; Co., and
Whitehead, who served in the Reagan administration, were named as
chairmen of the boards of directors of the Polish-American and
Hungarian-American Enterprise Funds, respectively.
   The funds were set up by Congress to oversee the investment of
total of $300 million in private sector development in the two new
Eastern European democracies. The funds can be used for loans,
grants and investment in Polish and Hungarian corporations.
   Other members of the Polish-American Enterprise Fund board named
Friday by Bush were AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland; Zbigniew
Brzezinski, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies;
Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive officer of CONAGRA;
and Nicholas Rey, managing director of Bear, Stearns and Co.
   Other members named to the Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund
board were Daniel Burke, chief exective officer of Capital
Cities-ABC; George Gould, vice chairman, Klingenstein Fields and
Co.; Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International
and Paul Marer of Indiana University.
   ``The president is extremely pleased with the high caliber and
range of professional diversity of the individuals who have agreed
to serve on the organizing boards of directors for the two funds,''
said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday
gave the breakaway Lithuanian republic three days to start
returning to the Soviet fold, but he did not say what the Kremlin
would do if Lithuania refused.
   The republic's leader declared Moscow's views irrelevant.
Lithuania announced plans to start setting up check points on its
borders.
   The official Tass news agency distributed the text of a terse
telegram from Gorbachev to Lithuania President Vytautas
Landsbergis. It accompanied a copy of the Soviet Parliament's
proclamation Thursday that Lithuania's declaration of independence
was invalid.
   ``In a three-day period, inform about measures toward realizing
this directive,'' said the telegram, signed ``President U.S.S.R. M.
Gorbachev.''
   Parliament elected Gorbachev to the presidency this week and
gave him expanded powers.
   The prospect of Gorbachev assuming new authority allowing him to
thwart moves toward independence drove the Baltic republic on
Sunday to reclaim the sovereignty that existed between 1918 and
1940, when Stalin's army moved in.
   Gorbachev on Tuesday called the move ``illegal and invalid,''
but said Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and a commission would conduct
talks with Lithuania. But he said they would not amount to
negotiations.
   ``We cannot talk about negotiations. You carry out negotiations
with foreign countries,'' Gorbachev said.
   At a news conference Thursday night, Gorbachev said he expected
to carry out ``a respectful dialogue'' with Lithuania.
   The Soviet leader and his advisers have ruled out the use of
force to bring Lithuania back into the union, but Gorbachev has
demanded $34 billion in reparations for Soviet investment in
factories and infrastructure and wants to discuss territorial
questions.
   Many Lithuanians expect an economic boycott by Moscow.
   Gorbachev was told by parliament on Thursday, the day he
formally was given his new powers, to work out the dispute with the
republic.
   However, Tass quoted Landsbergis as telling the republic of 3.7
million people that Moscow had no right to tell it what to do.
   ``It is not a problem that they do not recognize us now,'' Tass
quoted Landsbergis as saying on television. ``The time will come,
and they will recognize us.''
   He said talks with Moscow undoubtedly would take place, Tass
reported.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party leader, Algirdas Brazauskas, who
started the drive toward independence but lost the presidency to
Landsbergis, also appeared on TV and joined in appealing for unity
and calm, Tass said.
   The Lithuanian government renamed the government newspaper
Soviet Lithuania to Echo of Lithuania, and approved plans to set up
37 border checkpoints in the near future as part of an effort to
prevent uncontrolled export of commodities, the Soviet news agency
said.
   Lithuania borders the Russian, Byelorussian and Latvian
republics of the Soviet Union. It faces the Baltic Sea, but has no
other land borders.
   When they declared independence Sunday, Lithuanian legislators
also changed their homeland's name to the Republic of Lithuania and
dropped the Soviet republic's emblem.
   Lithuania's decision was bitterly criticized by deputies from
other republics. They approved the directive urging Gorbachev to
``ensure the defense of the legal rights of every person living on
Lithuanian territory,'' as well as defending Soviet interests there.
   Admiral Vitaly Ivanov, commander of the Soviet Baltic Fleet,
accused Lithuania leaders of ``betrayal of their own people and the
people of the Soviet Union,'' and called the declaration of
independence ``a stab in the back.''

<HEAD>CDC Considering Ban on Many Lab Monkey Importations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The national Centers for Disease Control is
considering banning most U.S. primate importations after a rare,
deadly virus turned up in monkeys in at least two laboratories,
officials said.
   In a letter to about 200 primate importers in the United States,
CDC Director William L. Roper warned, ``The health of your workers
may be at risk.''
   Ebola virus _ the deadliest virus known to man before the
discovery of AIDS _ was spotted in this country in November in
three monkeys at a Virginia products testing center. In January, an
Ebola-related virus turned up in a monkey at a Pennsylvania lab.
   Now, in the wake of the initial reports, ``further active
transmission in monkeys in quarantine has been demonstrated,''
Roper said in his letter. The warning was sent Thursday to primate
importers, health officials and others.
   The additional transmission has occurred at the Virginia
laboratory, Hazleton Research of Reston, officials said.
   At least 173 people in the United States have been in contact
with monkeys, blood or tissue from infected lots, with one person
showing Ebola antibodies, Roper said.
   About 10 percent of monkeys studied from different countries
show signs of infection with filoviruses, the family including
Ebola virus.
   The primates involved are cynomolgus monkeys, which account for
about 75 percent of all primates brought to the United States,
according to officials of the Atlanta-based CDC. About 16,000
cynomolgus monkeys were imported last year.
   ``These data indicate a definite risk, probably at a fairly low
level, of human infection in the course of ordinary handling and
management of monkeys,'' Roper said.
   ``CDC is considering imposing a temporary ban on the importation
into the United States of cynomolgus monkeys,'' he said.
   Atlanta's Yerkes Regional Primate Center, one of the nation's
leading primate research centers, has 38 cynomolgus monkeys,
long-tailed macaques. But a ban would not affect the center too
much, said spokeswoman Cathy Yarbrough.
   Large primate research centers such as Yerkes breed many of
their own animals.
   The CDC last month issued new guidelines for workers involved in
the handling of such primates, calling for 31-day quarantines,
restricted access to animal holding areas in primate importation
areas and protective clothing for all workers in direct animal
contact.
   Those guidelines are now mandatory, effective immediately, Roper
said.

<HEAD>American Head of WHO's AIDS Unit Resigns in Protest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Jonathan Mann, the American expert who has led
the World Health Organization's battle against AIDS, announced
Friday that he is resigning because of major differences with WHO's
director-general.
   The announcement surprised Mann's co-workers in WHO's AIDS
program. One British AIDS specialist called the resignation a
``major disaster.''
   The organization's director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima of
Japan, issued a statement saying he regretted the announcement
``which happened, without previous consultation, at a time when the
organization is confronted with new challenges concerning the fight
against AIDS.'' He declined further comment.
   Mann's letter of resignation indicated there had been
disagreements between the two men ever since Nakajima took office
in 1988. Nakajima succeeded Dr. Halfdan Mahler of Denmark.
   ``On the basis of my experiences during the last two years, I
have now come to the conclusion that there is a great variance
between our positions on a series of issues which I consider
critical for the Global AIDS Strategy and the WHO Global Program on
Aids,'' he said.
   The program seeks to control an epidemic that has spread to more
than 150 countries since it was first identified in 1981. More than
220,000 cases were registered worldwide by the WHO last month. Mann
estimates there will be 6 million cases by the year 2000.
   His letter of resignation and a memorandum he sent to his staff,
both released to the media, did not explain the differences he had
with Nakajima.
   However, the departure follows persistent rumors of low morale
among the 4,500-staff of WHO. Many blamed the director-general's
management style for the problem. Critics reportedly complained of
autocratic methods and of sudden transfers without prior notice.
   The Netherland's mission to the United Nations, in a
confidential letter quoted by Dutch newspapers this year, said work
at the agency was deteriorating.
   Mann said his resignation was effective at the end of his term
in June.
   Nakajima, 61, took office in 1988. Before that, he was in charge
of WHO's Manila-based regional office for the Western Pacific. He
held that job nine years.
   When his candidacy for the top executive post became known,
there were reports critically assessing his work on his previous
assignments.
   Mann, a public health official who grew up in Boston and
attended Harvard, joined WHO in June 1986. The AIDS program then
consisted of Mann and a secretary, with funds coming from the
regular WHO budget.
   The program now has a staff of close to 200 and a special budget
that has tripled in the past three years to $109 million.
   Mann, 42, has been traveling throughout the world to push a
worldwide campaign to inform people of the dangers of AIDS and the
methods of protection.
   WHO spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said that following the
announcement of Mann's resignation, he and Nakajima had a
``cordial'' meeting and agreed there are ``no differences on the
fundamental problems'' of the Global AIDS Strategy.
   It was not immediately possible to reconcile that statement with
Mann's letter and memorandum. Gastaut said Nakajima could not be
interviewed because he was leaving for Afghanistan on Friday night.
Mann left word with his office that he was not prepared to talk to
the media.
   In London, Dr. Tony Pinching, who works at one of Britain's
leading AIDS treatment centers, said: ``The loss of Dr. Mann is a
major disaster, but it goes beyond that, and I view this with very
grave concern indeed.
   ``There are few people of his caliber around. He has directed
the program with great vision and ability and will be very
difficult to replace.''
   The resignation symbolized a ``very serious breakdown within the
WHO'' which must be resolved for the sake of the program, he said.
   The British government's chief medical officer, Sir Donald
Acheson, said: ``I have a very high personal regard for Dr. Mann
who has worked tirelessly with all countries to develop a global
strategy to reduce the spread of HIV, (the AIDS virus), to provide
appropriate care, and protect the rights and dignity of those
affected.''

<HEAD>Moslem Brotherhood Urges Armed Struggle Against Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem fundamentalists who hold the largest
bloc in parliament on Friday urged Arab neighbors to drop peaceful
efforts to end the Arab-Israeli dispute and instead take up
military action against Israel.
   In a statement sent to The Associated Press, the Moslem
Brotherhood organization also urged Arabs to destroy U.S. interests
in the Middle East, and it threatened the Soviet Union.
   ``We call on all Arabs to drop the option of a peaceful
settlement with Israel ... and seriously return to the military
option which was dropped by Arabs in 1974,'' the statement said.
   ``We should prepare all the Arab nation, males and females, to
become an armed popular army that will convert every inch of the
Palestinian land to become a bursting volcano where Jews will be
buried.''
   The Brotherhood movement made similar demands during November's
election campaign. Its members captured almost two dozen of the 80
seats in parliament _ far ahead of any rival faction but not enough
to dominate legislation.
   The Brotherhood electoral strength has had no effect on King
Hussein's moderate policy of Arab-Israeli peace, which is based on
Israeli withdrawal from the territories it captured from Jordan,
Egypt and Syria in the 1967 war.
   Roughly half of Jordan's 3.1 million residents come from
Palestinian families driven out of their homeland by the wars that
created Israel and expanded its control over the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   The brotherhood statement responded to reports that hundreds of
thousands of Soviet Jews plan to immigrate to Israel this year.

<HEAD>Victims of Child Labor Violations Urge Congress to Stiffen
Penalties</HEAD>

   The car wash that illegally hired Matthew
Garvey at age 13 was fined $400 after he lost a leg at the weekend
job, the boy told Congress Friday as child labor victims called for
stiffer penalties.
   Garvey, using a cane to help him walk with an artificial leg,
told the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and
housing that he had landed the job easily and had not been asked
for a work permit.
   Now 16, the Laurel, Md., boy said the accident occurred in 1987,
when he was sitting on a dryer that pulled his leg into the machine
and severed it.
   At the hearing, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called for
mandatory six-month jail terms and fines of up to $100,000 for
employers that repeatedly violate child labor laws. He also called
for increasing the civil penalties for child labor violations from
$1,000 to $10,000.
   Schumer said that from 1987 to 1989 there were 128,000 minors
who were injured and an estimated 59 killed in the workplace. The
37 employers who were cited for violations relating to those cases
were fined a total of $27,000, he said.
   ``The average penalty was a paltry $740 _ $740 for a child's
life in the United States,'' Schumer said.
   Suzanne Boutros, of Plainfield, Ind., said she was unaware until
after her 17-year-old's death delivering a pizza that it was
illegal for youngsters to drive cars on their jobs. The $1,000 fine
that the pizza shop was assessed was not enough, she said.
   ``The quickest way to get sombeody's attention is through their
pocketbook,'' Ms. Boutros said.
   On Thursday, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole announced that a
three-day sting operation had uncovered 7,000 minors employed in
dangerous jobs or working long hours in violation of child labor
laws. The companies are expected to face civil fines totaling $1.8
million, she said.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., called the
operation a ``spectacular public relations extravaganza,'' but said
it had probably heightened the public's awareness about child labor
violations.
   Lantos noted that the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, has reported that the 1,000 federal labor law
inspectors spend about 4 percent of their efforts on child labor
investigations.
   He called that percentage ``ludicrously and pathetically
inadequate.''
   Mrs. Dole has said she is not yet convinced additional resources
are needed but said she will consider legislative changes such as
stiffer penalties.
   Schumer and Pease are drafting a bill that would increase the
penalties and make other changes in the law, such as expanding the
definition of child labor violations to include door-to-door sales.
They expect to introduce the measure next month.
   Lantos said the panel will try to find out whether child labor
violations have increased because of labor shortages or increased
economic pressures on families.

   Grumman Corp. pleaded guilty Friday to
illegally obtaining secret Air Force budget documents and was
ordered to pay $2.5 million in fines and penalties.
   Grumman's guilty plea in U.S. District Court in suburban
Alexandria, Va. made it the fourth defense contractor since
November to plea guilty to illegal trafficking of Pentagon
documents.
   The company pleaded guilty to two counts of conveyance of
government property without authority in U.S. District Court in
Alexandria.
   The company admitted that it obtained the two secret Air Force
program objective memoranda for 1983 and 1984 through its former
employee Harry Kotellos.
   Kotellos, 53, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who joined
Grumman in 1980, pleaded guilty last Monday to conspiracy. He faces
a possible five-year prison term and a fine of up to $250,000.
   In a statement of facts filed by prosecutors, Grumman admitted
that between 1978 and 1985 it illegally acquired a wide range of
Defense Department budget documents, including five-year spending
plans for Pentagon programs.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton, who accepted the guilty
plea, ordered the company to pay $2.5 million in fines and civil
penalties.
   In a statement, the Grumman said it ``deeply regrets that the
company or any of its employees was involved in conduct that
resulted in today's guilty plea.''
   ``Grumman fully recognizes the importance of adhering
scrupulously to proper security procedures, and the company
deplores the involvement of any of its employees in the misuse of
classified documents,'' the company said.
   Grumman said it has instituted procedures ``designed to prevent
any reoccurence'' of the offense.
   Since November, three other contractors have entered guilty
pleas and three other individuals have been convicted in the
investigation code-named ``Operation Uncover,'' an investigation
still under way.
   They were:
   _Boeing Co. Boeing paid fines and penalties of $5.2 million
following its Nov. 13 guilty plea. Former Boeing employee Richard
Lee Fowler was convicted Dec. 7 of 39 counts of conspiracy,
conveyance without authority, mail fraud and conversion of
government property. He received a two-year prison sentence.
   _RCA Corp., a subsidiary of General Electric Co. RCA pleaded
guilty Feb. 5 and paid fines and restitution totaling $2.5 million.
A current RCA executive, Ronald Stevens, and a former executive,
Leonard Kampf, are awaiting sentencing on their guilty pleas to
conveyance without authority. They each face possible sentence of
10 years in prison.
   _Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.
Hughes entered a guilty plea March 9 and was ordered to pay $3.57
million in fines and penalties.

   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Friday
called on the interior minister to resign over a shooting outside
the Central Bank that occurred when police tried to arrest the
bank's governor.
   Banks throughout Lebanon began a two-day strike to protest the
arrest attempt.
   The Central Bank interrupted foreign exchange operations
Thursday, a few minutes after a police patrol sent by Interior
Minister Elias Khazen arrived at the bank with a warrant to arrest
bank director Edmond Naim.
   Sources at the bank said the conflict began when Naim refused to
allocate $1.5 million that Khazen had requested for printing one
million new Lebanese passports.
   Naim, a Maronite Catholic, has been a virtual prisoner in the
bank for two years due to fears for his safety. The bank is in
Moslem west Beirut. Bank employees surrounded the police to prevent
Naim's arrest Thursday.
   One employee was wounded when police shot in the air to try to
disperse the group. The police left the building after bank guards
began shooting in the air.
   Banks said they intend to strike until ``the instigators are
brought to trial.''
   A government spokesman quoted Hoss as saying that ``this
aggression should not go unpunished. The person basically
responsible for the attack should bare the responsibility.''
   ``The natural way to achieve this is for the interior minister
to resign,'' Hoss was quoted as telling President Elias Hrawi by
telephone.
   Khazen and Naim are both Maronites, the Catholic community that
has dominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943. The
bank is in Syrian-controlled Moslem west Beirut. Naim is one of the
only Maronite officials to have an office on the Moslem side of the
city.
   Khazen had negotiated a contract with a British company to print
the Lebanese passports, but Naim had already received an offer from
a Swedish firm to print the passports at half that cost.
   Khazen visited Naim late Thursday to apologize for the incident
and said that ``the incident is over. Its consequences have been
solved.''
   But the independent an-Nahar newspaper said Naim has decided to
sue the interior minister on charges of attempted murder and
kidnapping.
   Justice Minister Nabih Berri said Friday the government will
hold an extraordinary session to discuss the attemped arrest.
   The Lebanese pound, once the most solid currency in the Middle
East, has been hit hard by the 15-year civil war, dropping in the
past five years from five pounds per dollar to around 550.
   Until now the bank has been the only government institution to
remain largely intact through the war.

   Hundreds of blind people demonstrated
outside government headquarters Friday, waving their canes and
demanding pensions, priority housing and control over industries
where large numbers of the blind work.
   ``We demand...the right to work,'' said Ion Manea, a
representative of the the Enterprise for the Blind. ``Up to now
we've only made brushes and boxes and done massage and worked on
the switchboard.''
   ``Since we were trained to do this ... and we cannot do anything
else, we ask the goverment to give us a monopoly over these
professions,'' he said.
   Manea said his group was also demanding pensions for the blind
and a priority in the allocation of government assigned apartments.
   The blind received few benefits under President Nicolae
Ceausescu, who was overthrown in a bloody December revolution. But
they were well treated compared to the mentally and physically
handicapped, who were locked in state institutions under extremely
poor conditions.
   The number of blind people in Romania's 23 million population
was not available.

   A white motorist died Friday
when black township residents, believing they were about to be
attacked by a rival black group, stopped his car on a back road and
hacked him to death, police said.
   Two black residents also apparently died of shock after hearing
unfounded reports of the impending attack, they said.
   Police warned motorists against using the sideroads and old
highways passing near black townships to avoid mobs who were
stopping and stoning cars. More than 300 blacks have been killed in
nationwide unrest over the past six weeks in some of the worst
violence since the mid-1980s. Much of the violence has involved
black-on-black fighting.
   Late Thursday, thousands of women and children in townships
south of Johannesburg took refuge in hospitals, police stations and
trade union offices after hearing rumors that Zulu migrant workers
would attack, police said.
   Men remained at home, arming themselves and setting up
roadblocks of huge stones on the highways south of Johannesburg.
Mobs numbering in the hundreds stoned cars that failed to stop,
police said.
   Police said the 40-year-old white man driving his luxury car
past the black residential area of Sebokeng, south of Johannesburg,
was killed when a crowd of blacks armed with pickaxes and machetes
hacked him to death, police said.
   A 17-year-old white girl was injured when rioters hurled a
garden fork through the back window of the car in which she was
riding, piercing her forehead, according to relatives and police.
   The couple she was riding were injured by glass splinters as tin
cans and rocks shattered the car windows, the independent South
African Press Association reported.
   The Zulus, one of several black tribes in South Africa, come
from the southeast part of the country. Most blacks in the
Johannesburg area belong to other tribes.
   Meanwhile, police said a black policeman arrested in connection
with the shooting death of a white riot squad officer was killed
Friday while attempting to escape from his captors.
   Maj. Deon Terblanche, head of riot police in Pietermaritzburg,
Natal Province, was found Wednesday slumped over the wheel of his
unmarked car, parked beside a freeway. He had been shot several
times at close range.
   A black constable and member of the riot police, Ray Ngcobo, was
arrested Thursday in connection with the slaying.
   Ngcobo was expected to be brought to court Friday, but instead,
police said he was taken by car to the scene of Terblanche's death.
Ngcobo grabbed the pistol of one of the officers, who then shot
him, police said.
   Elsewhere, a black man was killed in an exchange of gunfire with
army troops in a township outside the port city of Durban, police
said.

13-month interim government after the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada
in 1983, was sworn in as prime minister on Friday following an
indecisive national election.
   British Governor General Sir Paul Scoon administered the oath of
office to Brathwaite although his National Democratic Congress
party wound up one seat short of a parliamentary majority in
Tuesday's election.
   A party normally must have a parliamentary majority to form a
government, but the governor-general has constitutional discretion
to waive the requirement if he thinks enough legislative support
exists to govern.
   The National Democratic Congress won seven of the 15 seats in
the House of Representatives, Grenada's parliament. The Grenada
United Labor Party of former Prime Minister Sir Eric Gairy came in
second with four seats.
   Two seats each went to The National Party, led by Ben Jones, and
the New National Party, led by former Cabinet minister Keith
Mitchell.
   The deadlock was broken after Brathwaite reached a tentative
deal with Jones Friday. Jones resigned earlier in the day as acting
prime minister, a post he held since the death of Prime Minister
Herbert Blaize in December.
   Brathwaite and Jones both said they held talks Thursday about a
new government, but they gave conflicting versions of what emerged.
   Brathwaite said Jones agreed to become deputy prime minister in
the new government; Jones' colleague, legislator Alleyne Walker,
would become public works minister, and both would support
Brathwaite in moving legislation through parliament.
   Jones said the deal offered by Brathwaite was not good enough
and he was waiting to hear further from him. He denied assuring
Brathwaite of support, saying: ``I told him clearly that I was not
making any commitment on that.''
   The mix-up could mean this tiny Caribbean island nation of
94,000 people may have to hold another election.
   Brathwaite, 64, headed an interim government after U.S. troops,
joined by a small regional force, invaded Gerenada on Oct. 25,
1983, and toppled a ruling Marxist junta. He was president until
the last election in December 1984.
   Grenada gained independence from Britain in 1974.

   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, met President and Mrs. Bush at the
White House then addressed a ceremony across the street at
Lafayette Park.
   Directing her remarks to her brother's captors, she said: ``You
complain that your story has not been told and yet the man who
would tell it has been chained to a basement wall for five years.
...
   ``I don't want to punish them. I don't want to hunt them down. I
just want my brother back,'' she said.
   Others at the observance included Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan,
D-N.Y.; newsman Dan Rather, and the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a
former hostage.

   Two former hostages in Lebanon, Jean-Paul Kauffmann and Roger
Auque, put on blindfolds and chained themselves to a tree outside
the Iranian Embassy.
   The two were silent during their demonstration, but said in a
statement: ``We have taken this action so people know how Terry
Anderson is living at this moment. He is chained. He wears a
blindfold over his eyes. He must be silent. This is how we were.
This is how he is today.''
   The statement said the demonstration was not intended as a
``hostile action'' against Iran, but added: ``We know the role
played by certain Iranian officials in our tragedy.''

   Erich Honecker admits he made
mistakes during his 18 years of iron-fisted rule, but feels he
should not become a scapegoat for everything that went wrong, a
pastor's wife who gave him refuge said Friday.
   ``He told me that some mistakes were made, but that not
everything (done by his government) was a complete failure,'' said
Sigrid Holmer, who with her husband, Thomas, a Lutheran pastor, has
taken in the ailing 77-year-old Honecker and his wife.
   Two days before the East German elections, Mrs. Holmer spoke in
the living room of the two-story parish house where the disgraced
Communist and his wife, Margot, have lived since Jan. 30.
   The Holmers provided a safe haven after no one else would take
in the Honeckers, who only five months ago were cheered by millions
of East Germans. Lutheran Church documents show that, among others,
the army refused to let the Honeckers live at a military base,
saying it could not guarantee their safety.
   Honecker, toppled by a popular revolution in October, faces
trial on high treason charges, but was released after a two-day
detention in prison in January because he suffers from kidney
cancer.
   The Honeckers live in seclusion in the house, with graying
stucco walls and a forest nearby.
   When Mrs. Holmer's 18-year-old son, Traugott, asked Honecker on
Friday at the request of an Associated Press reporter whether he
had a message for East Germans before the elections, Honecker
responded that his lawyers had asked him to remain silent.
   ``When the lines of curiosity-seekers drive by every weekend,
Honecker sometimes stands at the second-floor window and looks
outside,'' the son said.
   Mrs. Holmer said the Honeckers closely follow East German
political developments, reading several East and West German
newspapers and watching television.
   They live in two rooms on the second floor, and Mrs. Honecker,
62, cooks their meals on a small stove, said Mrs. Holmer. She said
the couple brought a couch and table from their former home in
Wandlitz, a secluded luxury enclave near Berlin, but that the rest
of the furniture was provided by the Holmers.
   Honecker remains indoors nearly all the time, only taking an
occasional evening walk with the pastor. ``My husband looks around
first if the coast is clear'' to make sure Honecker will not be
accosted outdoors, she said.
   Mrs. Holmer said the family also received bomb threats after
taking in the Honeckers. On Friday a coal truck driver passing by
the house shouted ``Kill the guy!'' and then drove off.
   Honecker's former political cronies have abandoned him. Only his
daughter, Sonja, and infant granddaughter, Viviane, visit
occasionally, bringing food and other supplies from nearby Berlin.
   Mrs. Holmer described Honecker as a ``very considerate guest.''
   At first, the Honeckers ate with the Holmer family downstairs.
``The first day, my husband told him that we usually say grace
before dinner,'' Mrs. Holmer said. ``Mr. Honecker said `Of course,
go right ahead.'''
   Under the Honecker regime, Christians could practice their
religion, but were hindered when they wanted to study at a
university or advance in their jobs.
   Mrs. Holmer said nine of her 10 children were unable to go to
college because they refused to join the Communist Party's youth
movement. The youngest, Kornelius, is 14 and will have a free
choice.
   But Traugott, who gave his room to the Honeckers, had to become
an apprentice carpenter because the road to higher education was
blocked.
   He said he felt no bitterness toward Mrs. Honecker, who was
education minister during his school years. ``She is a pretty nice
lady, and we talk sometimes,'' said Traugott, a lanky teen-ager
with unruly blond hair.
   Then he excused himself and sped off on his motorbike to put up
campaign posters for the conservative Alliance for Germany in
Lobetal, a village of 700 people about six miles northeast of
Berlin.
   The Lutheran Church presence is particularly strong in Lobetal,
which also contains homes for the retarded, elderly and
handicapped. Drab, weathered homes line cobblestone streets. A
pleasant woods surrounds most of the town.
   Mrs. Holmer, 58, said she took the hard times under the
Communists in stride. ``Christians were never promised a pain-free
life,'' she said.
   Asked why she took in the Honeckers, she said: ``We have a
statue of Christ here, and underneath is the biblical inscription,
`Come to me, all those who are tired and downtrodden.'''

<HEAD>Cheney: Preliminary US-Philippine Base Talks Begin Next Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Friday the
long-delayed talks on the future of the six U.S. military bases in
the Philippines will begin next month.
   Cheney stressed, however, that ``we'll depart'' the Philippines
if the talks do not result in an agreement acceptable to the United
States.
   Anti-American sentiment has been running high in the Philippines
on the base issue.
   During a two-week trip last month to Asia that included a stop
in Manila, protestors burned figures of Cheney in effigy and he was
snubbed by Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
   Mrs. Aquino expressed unhappiness over a $96 million cut
Congress made in the Bush administration's request of $360 million
to compensate the Philippines for the use of sites that include the
two largest U.S. bases overseas _ Clark Air Base and Subic Naval
Base.
   The leases for the six sites expire next year.
   Preliminary talks on the bases had been scheduled to start in
last December, but were put off following the most recent coup
attempt against the Aquino government.
   Cheney noted the divisiveness of the issue within the
Philippines in discussing the bases Friday at the National
Newspaper Association. ``The situation in the Philippines is a
difficult one,'' he said.
   But despite the public tiff with Mrs. Aquino, Cheney praised her
as a ``symbol of democracy'' because she helped topple the regime
of Ferdinand Marcos and helped restore democracy.
   ``Our presence in the Philippines has been important to the U.S.
... We have an interest in continuing at Subic and Clark Air Force
Base if we can,'' Cheney said.
   The secretary said he learned what a ``very sensitive issue''
the bases are for Filipinos during his Philippine visit, but he
stressed ``there is a limit to what we can afford to pay in order
to continue to use those facilities.''
   ``And we will begin the negotiations next month. Hopefully,
we'll be able to reach an agreement that will allow us to continue
to use those facilities. But obviously, if the Filipinos do not
want us there or if we're unable to conclude an acceptable
agreement from our standpoint, we'll depart,'' Cheney said.
   A Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
specific date for the talks has not been set, but that they were
expected to begin in mid-April.
   The preliminary talks are expected to lay the groundwork for
full-scale negotiations between representatives that will be
appointed to handle the talks, another official said.
   ``We have to agree to negotiate. The Filipinos could decide not
to negotiate. That's a possibility,'' the second official said.
   Cheney's visit to the Philippines came during a trip designed to
reassess the U.S. military posture in the Pacific and to prepare a
plan to reduce troops in the region by 10 percent in light of tight
budgets and reduced international tensions.
   In his speech, Cheney said America would fall from superpower
status if military spending were cut in half over the next decade,
as proposed by some defense experts.
   ``When serious people propose cutting the defense budget by half
over the next 10 years ... they are not talking just about simple
budget shifts,'' Cheney said. ``They would give us the defense
budget for a second-class power.''
   Among the most prominent advocates of halving the defense budget
over the coming decade is William Kaufmann, a former Pentagon
official who recently said such large reductions could be achieved
without harming the nation's security.
   The Bush administration is proposing to cut next year's defense
budget by about 2 percent, after inflation, to $292 billion. Many
in Congress are pressing for a bigger cut.
   ``I think the notion of America's inevitable decline is both
wrong and dangerous,'' Cheney said. ``My sincere belief is that far
from becoming less of a force in the world, America is going to be
taking on greater global responsibilities in years ahead.''

   A Portuguese journalist working for
LUSA news agency and the Voice of America was ordered to leave
Mozambique on Friday because of a story he wrote, and the VOA said
he departed for France.
   The government had ordered Antonoio Mateus out of this southeast
African country, a former Portuguese possession, within 24 hours
for writing a story it said damaged Mozambique's image and
constituted ``active disinformation.''
   Information Minister Teodato Hunguana also said the story, filed
to LUSA, the Portuguese news agency, and the U.S.-based radio
network ``has no basis in fact.'' But other government departments
acknowledged that elements of the story were true.
   According to Hunguana, Mateus filed a story Monday saying
military helicopters flew over the capital the previous Saturday
and that on Monday special police units patrolled the city
following ``rumors about the launching of a wave of protest against
the cost of living.'' Hunguana said the story also mentioned the
detention of ``12 unemployed people'' Monday.
   The Mozambican national news agency AIM quoted an official
source as saying it is routine for air force helicopters to fly
over the capital, and that the flights Saturday ``had nothing to do
with the rumors referred to by LUSA.''
   AIM said the detentions mentioned by Mateus did occur, but had
nothing to do with the kind of operation he described. It said
police made arrests after a gang of petty criminals stole goods
from stallholders in an open market.
   Deputy VOA director Bob Coonrod told The Associated Press in
Washington that Mozambican authorities were offended because Mateus
refused to divulge the name of a senior police officer he quoted
anonymously in his account.
   Coonrod said Mateus had been a part-time reporter for VOA for
three years.

   Heavy rain fell across much of the Southeast on Friday, causing
flooding in Florida and Georgia. In the Northeast, the record heat
wave held on but blowing snow obscured parts of the upper Midwest.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from southern
Louisiana across southern and central Mississippi, Alabama, the
northwestern two-thirds of Georgia, western South Carolina, western
North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, western Virginia, West Virginia,
the Maryland Panhandle, southwestern through central Pennsylvania
and eastern Ohio.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to noon included 3.6
inches at Milton, Fla.; 2.79 inches at Troy, Ala.; 2.4 inches at
Fort Benning, Ga.; 1.93 inches at Anniston, Ala.; 1.86 inches at
Columbus, Ga.; 1.72 inches at Pensacola, Fla.; 1.71 inches at
Mobile, Ala.; 1.58 inches at New Orleans; 1.32 inches at Atlanta;
1.36 inches at Marietta, Ga.; 1.34 inches at Asheville, N.C.; and
1.03 inches at Bluefield, W.Va.
   That brought the total rainfall since noon Thursday to 10.63
inches at Mobile and 8.51 inches at Montgomery, Ala.
   Heavy rain closed schools and highways and sent rivers over
their banks in northern Georgia. And as much as 5 more inches of
rain was expected through Saturday as wet weather moves across the
region from the Gulf of Mexico.
   Polk County, Ga., police ordered the evacuation of a trailer
park on the edge of Cedartown, where 4.1 inches of rain fell.
Authorities in Chattooga County reported 16 secondary roads closed
by water and said they did not have enough warning signs to go
around.
   A series of northern Georgia floods beginning Feb. 10 resulted
in at least nine deaths.
   In southern Alabama, schools were closed in Mobile and highways
and homes were flooded.
   Alabama state troopers in Crenshaw County temporarily closed
U.S. Highway 29 between Brantley and Dozier after an earthen dam on
a 3-acre private pond broke. Several homes were evacuated south of
Foley because another dam burst on a private lake.
   No serious injuries were reported, but a Mobile police officer
suffered a leg injury when his patrol car was washed off a highway
into a utility pole.
   In the western Florida Panhandle, flooded roads also stranded
motorists in stalled cars and violent wind caused minor property
damage, authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   A child clinging to a bridge over a swollen creek was rescued in
the Cantonment area about 10 miles north of Pensacola, said Lt.
Keith Edmonson of the Cantonment Volunteer Fire Department.
   In Santa Rosa County, Fla., several roads were closed north of
Milton and a tornado reportedly damaged several trees at Milton,
but there were no injuries or damage to the building, said Peggy
Cheshire, a Civil Defense assistant.
   Friday's record highs, according to the National Weather
Service, were 78 at Atlantic City, N.J.; 76 at Baltimore; 65 at
Binghamton, N.Y.; 68 at Buffalo, N.Y.; 78 at Burlington, Vt.; 82 at
Newark, N.J.; 82 at New York; 71 at Rochester, N.Y.; 78 at
Syracuse, N.Y.; 70 at Worcester, Mass.; and 79 at Windsor Locks,
Conn.
   The heat wave began March 8, starting in Montana and Wyoming,
then spread east and south, followed by cooler air.
   Another part of the nation also had warmer weather Friday _
Barrow, Alaska, posted a record high of 27.
   More seasonable weather dominated the upper Midwest, where snow
fell over northwestern Iowa, eastern South Dakota, eastern North
Dakota and northern Minnesota. Rain fell across eastern Nebraska
and west-central through southwestern Iowa.
   Advisories of blowing and drifting snow were posted over
northeastern North Dakota and west-central and northwestern
Minnesota. Eight to 12 inches of snow fell across that region
Thursday.
   Wind gusted to 62 mph at Chadron, Neb., 59 mph at Rapid City,
S.D., and near 50 mph at Pierre, S.D., during the morning.
   Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr signed a request Friday that
tornado-ravaged south-central Nebraska be declared a federal
disaster area. Adj. Gen. Stanley Heng of the Nebraska National
Guard, who also heads the state Civil Defense, said the overall
damage could be over $10 million.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 24 at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 87 at Avon Park, FlA.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 4 above zero at
Gunnison, Colo.

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Friday a suspected chemical weapons plant in Libya was most likely
``out of business'' as a result of this week's blaze.
   ``I don't think we can say for certain ... but we do think some
very extensive and serious damage has been done,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said he would not speculate on whether sabotage caused the
explosion and fire at the Rabta plant. ``We still do not have a
conclusion of how it occured.''
   Asked if the United States had been assured by Israel and West
Germany that they were not responsible for the fire, Fitzwater
would only say: ``I don't know who we've talked to about this.''
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi had said his government is
investigating to determine whether West German intelligence agents
had anything to do with Wednesday's fire.
   Both Israel and West Germany have denied any responsiblity, as
has the United States.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, asked during an appearance Friday
at a National Newspaper Association conference about the fire,
said, ``I'm inclined to attribute it more to Libyan incompetence
than anything else.''
   The Bush administration has said all along that the plant was
producing poison gas, although Libya insists the factory was making
pharmaceuticals.
   ``It seems likely that it's out of business, common sense would
suggest that. But I don't think we can reach an absolute conclusion
at this point,'' Fitzwater said.

   Designers of the government's giant
atom-smasher are finally preparing to buy land for the project, but
the battle for funding has just begun, key backers told a
scientists' meeting Friday.
   The struggle to wring the first of a projected $7.5 billion from
the federal budget for the superconducting super collider will move
to the House Science, Space and Technology Committee in two weeks.
   Committee chairman Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., urged scientists,
educators and industry figures at the meeting here to lobby for the
project in Texas, designed to study the particles that make up
atoms.
   ``We can't build it alone,'' Roe said in a speech at the
International Industrial Symposium on the Super Collider. ``We
can't get the votes on the floor of the House alone.''
   The collider, awarded to Texas after an intense struggle among
several states, will consist of an underground loop 54 miles in
diameter to be built south of Dallas. The precise location of the
loop was revealed Thursday at the symposium.
   The collider would use powerful electromagnets to send streams
of protons traveling at nearly the speed of light smashing into
each other. The collisions would produce even smaller particles,
leading to a better understanding of the nature of matter.
   Four other members of Congress at the conference joined Roe in
urging a campaign of support.
   ``Make no mistake, this is not a done deal,'' said U.S. Rep. Jim
Chapman, D-Texas.
   Of the $7.5 billion the committee is expected to recommend
spending on the project over approximately 10 years, no more than
$5 billion should come from the federal government, Roe said. Most
estimates put the final price tag of the super collider at $8
billion.
   The remainder would come from Texas, foreign contributors, who
could serve as contractors or research partners, and from
innovative financing. One possibility, Roe said, would be to lease
some of the buildings on the campus planned to house the collider's
staff of 3,000 scientists and support workers.
   Critics say money spent on the super collider could be better
used to meet concrete needs such as housing and improved education.
   But supporters point to benefits of the competing CERN particle
physics project outside Geneva, Switzerland. Fourteen nations
cooperate in that project, which is said to have brought better
housing, improved the job market in the area and led to inventions.
   ``For every dollar we spend on (the collider) we'll at least
bring back five dollars that wasn't there before,'' Roe said.
   CERN is a model, but could become a threat if the collider isn't
built, some scientists say.
   ``It's important that you have good research opportunities for
faculty so that we don't undergo a brain drain'' of U.S.
scientists, said Marvin Gettner, particle physics professor at
Northeastern University in Boston who has worked at the Swiss
facility.

   To the tune of ``America,'' 400 students
on Friday sang out a plea for freedom for Terry Anderson and the
other American hostages in Lebanon.
   In their second annual American Hostage Day assembly, the
students at South Middle School sang:
   ``My country, can't you see
   ``Those losing liberty
   ``Please bring them home:
   ``We can't forget their plight,
   ``We want them in our sight,
   ``God using all your might
   ``Let them go free.''
   The ceremony was sponsored jointly by the school and by the
Society of Professional Journalists chapter at Emerson College in
Boston. It was the final day of Emerson College's ``Terry Anderson
Week,'' which featured a series of events to call attention to the
plight of the hostages.
   Friday's speakers included Jeremy Levin, a former Cable News
Network bureau chief in Beirut who himself was held hostage for
almost a year.
   Friday was the fifth anniversary of Anderson's kidnapping in
Beirut. He is the longest-held of eight American hostages in
Lebanon.

   Northwest Airlines on Friday fired three
pilots accused of flying while legally intoxicated, saying the
cockpit crew violated company rules by operating the jetliner
within 12 hours of drinking.
   Each of the pilots on the 6:25 a.m. flight from Fargo, N.D., to
the Twin Cities on March 8 had blood-alcohol levels exceeding .04
percent, a violation of federal regulations, the company said.
   ``Northwest pilots have established a reputation for airmanship
and safety,'' company spokesman Alan Muncaster said. ``All of us at
Northwest are now challenged to win back our reputation for flight
excellence.''
   The Federal Aviation Administration had already revoked the
pilots' licenses after its own investigation showed that the
cockpit crew boarded the flight within eight hours of drinking, the
federal limit. Northwest imposes a stricter span of 12 hours.
   Northwest Flight 650, carrying 91 passengers, landed safely at
the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, where the cockpit
crew was arrested by the FAA and airport police.
   Dismissed were Capt. Norman Prouse, 51, Conyers, Ga.; 1st
Officer Robert Kirchner, 35, Highland Ranch, Colo.; and 2nd Officer
Joseph Balzer, 34, Antioch, Tenn. None of the three has any
previous alcohol or drug-related incidents on their flying records,
the company said.
   Balzer's attorney, Bruce Hanley of Minneapolis, said he ``hasn't
taken a formal position'' on the firing. Calls to Kirchner could
not get through because the phone was busy and Prouse has an
unlisted telephone number.
   The Air Line Pilots Association, the union representing
Northwest's 5,400 pilots and about 36,600 other pilots, issued a
statement out of Washington on Friday saying it has ``no tolerance
whatsoever toward drugs or alcohol in the cockpit.
   ``Any airline pilot would be outraged and would take it as an
affront to his profession, if it were proven that a cockpit crew
flew impaired as alleged in this incident,'' the union statement
said.
   But the statement emphasized that the three Northwest pilots are
entitled to a fair hearing on the accusations.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has scheduled an
appeals hearing before an administrative law judge April 3-6 in
Minneapolis for the three crew members. All three were expected to
appeal the license revocation, although Kirchner was the only pilot
to file an appeal by Friday, said Drucilla Andersen, an NTSB
spokeswoman.
   The pilots also face possible criminal prosecution by the city
of Minneapolis and by the chief prosecutor in Cass County, North
Dakota.
   The pilots were drinking at the Speak Easy, a Moorhead, Minn.,
restaurant and lounge late the night before they flew the Boeing
727, and a tipster informed the FAA, officials said.
   The plane took off while an inexperienced federal inspector in
Fargo was telephoning his superiors to ask what to do, Associate
FAA Administrator Anthony Broderick told a congressional committee
Wednesday.
   Northwest said Friday that the inspector spoke to each of the
pilots at the Fargo airport but did not stop the flight.
   Balzer issued a statement Thursday saying he offered to take a
breath test, urine test or blood test for the FAA investigator
before boarding the plane in Fargo. He said he was not required to
do so.
   ``I offered to cooperate fully,'' Balzer said. ``It is absurd to
suggest that the plane could take off from the Fargo airport
without proper authorization from the control tower, which is
operated by the FAA and manned by FAA controllers.''
   Fred Farrar, an FAA spokesman in Washington, said Friday that
the inspector instructed the cockpit crew that they could be in
violation of FAA regulations by flying the plane. The crew decided
to fly the plane despite the warning, Farrar said.
   The FAA inspector in Fargo telephoned Minneapolis after the
flight departed from Fargo, setting up the arrest.

   Peace activist Abie Nathan met with PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat on Friday in defiance of an Israeli law that
has already put him behind bars once, the PLO news agency WAFA
reported.
   ``I came from Israel to meet with you after having spent 122
days in prison,'' WAFA quoted Nathan as saying to Arafat. ``I am
working for peace and am against the law prohibiting contacts with
the leaders of the PLO.''
   An amendment to Israel's anti-terrrorism law makes meeting with
officials in a terrorist organization a crime punishable by a
maximum prison sentence of three years.
   Israel considers the Palestine Liberation Organization a
terrorist group.
   ``Your courageous act is unforgettable for men who love peace
and for the Palestinian and Israeli people,'' the agency quoted
Arafat as saying. ``Future generations will appreciate your
courageous and noble struggle for peace in the region.''
   It was Nathan's eighth meeting with the PLO leader.
   Nathan's first meeting with Arafat was in 1982, when he went to
Lebanon during the Israeli siege of Beirut in an unsuccessful
attempt to gain freedom for a captured Israeli soldier.
   Nathan, 63, was sentenced to six months in prison after pleading
guilty to meeting Arafat and other PLO officials in Tunis in 1988.
He entered an Israeli prison near Tel Aviv on Oct. 10, 1989, and
his penalty was reduced by two months for good behavior.
   
   When he was freed Feb. 9, he passed through the prison gates and
immediately vowed to meet Arafat again.

<HEAD>Haiti State Council Pledges to Be `Watchdogs' for New President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A civilian State Council that will
help provisional President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot govern Haiti
pledged Friday to be her ``watchdogs'' until elections are held.
   She introduced 11 of the 19 council members at a ceremony at the
National Palace, saying, ``You are asked to help the government in
its efforts to put in place the structures and conditions for
holding democratic elections.''
   ``Rest assured, Madame President, we will be your watchdogs to
help you carry out the heavy load you have to bear,'' replied Louis
Roy, main author of Haiti's 1987 constitution and the most
prominent council member.
   The remaining members will come from eight provincial districts
and will be sworn in later.
   The State Council will represent labor, human rights, church,
business and peasant groups and will have veto power over
presidential decisions.
   The Cabinet, subject to council approval, is expected to be
appointed within days.
   Initially, the State Council was to contain an army
representative but Roy said Thursday the army chose not to be in
it. Roy said someone will be picked from The Women's Movement group
to fill the vacancy.
   That means Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's interim government will be
all-civilian. The military had ruled Haiti, one of the poorest
countries in the Western Hemisphere, since the fall of the Duvalier
family dictatorship in 1986.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillota, a Supreme Court justice and Haiti's
first woman president, became the country's leader Tuesday, one day
after military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril fled Haiti.
   She will govern until elections, expected within three to six
months.
   Businessman Antoine Izmery, a leader in the Unity Assembly party
coalition that chose Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, said the U.S. Embassy
is pushing for fast elections.
   The embassy denied it.
   ``The U.S. is more interested in a credible electoral process
than in any particular candidate,'' U.S. Ambassador Alvin Adams
told The Associated Press during Friday's ceremony.
   Adams was said to have played a big role in helping persuade
Avril to quit.
   The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a highly popular priest and a
strong critic of U.S. policy, cautioned the United States against
backing a candidate who represents the interests of Haiti's tiny
elite. He said that would provoke a popular reaction and could lead
to ``the revolutionary road.''

   Engineers managed to shift a wayward private
communications satellite out of harm's way Friday, at least
temporarily, and an aerospace company offered equipment for a
possible salvage mission by a space shuttle.
   Engineers were able to send the Intelsat VI satellite to a new,
higher orbit, where it won't be drawn back to Earth by the
thickening atmosphere.
   The satellite failed to separate from its launch vehicle, a
commercial Titan 3 rocket, after liftoff from Cape Canaveral on
Wednesday and was trapped in a useless orbit that swung within 103
miles of Earth.
   On Friday, rocket builder Martin Marietta attributed the failure
to a wiring problem in its Titan 3 launch vehicle that was
``undetected by the processes and test procedures used in
pre-launch checkout.''
   Kerry Masson, a Martin Marietta spokeswoman in Denver, said the
signal failed to make it from an onboard computer to the mechanism
that was to separate the rocket and the satellite.
   Without that separation, a motor attached to the satellite was
unable to propel the spacecraft to its duty station 22,300 miles
above Earth. When engineers finally separated the sent rockets, the
booster rocket remained with the launch vehicle and both were
expected to fall back to Earth soon.
   Intelsat, the international communications consortium which owns
the $150 million uninsured satellite, fired small onboard thrusters
and raised the satellite's orbit by nearly 60 miles. That put the
5-ton satellite out of immediate reach of the atmosphere.
   ``This is very good news,'' said Tony Trujillo, spokesman for
the 118-nation consortium. ``We feel much better about the mission
right now.''
   ``Right now, we are concentrating discussing with NASA on the
possibility of assistance,'' Trujillo said. Such assistance would
have to come from the space shuttle.
   Orbital Sciences Corp., a small Virginia aerospace company, sent
a letter to various parties, including Intelsat and NASA, offering
a newly developed rocket assembly that can be attached to a
stranded satellite in orbit.
   ``Specifically, the OSC plan is to carry a replacement perigee
motor to orbit on the shuttle, mate the motor to the satellite, and
complete the mission from orbit rather than returning the satellite
to Earth for refurbishment and relaunch,'' said the letter to NASA
administrator Richard Truly and others.
   The device, called a transfer orbit stage or TOS, is designed to
boost spacecraft from low Earth orbit to the 22,300 mile-high
altitude at which communications satellites operate. The device was
qualified for space flight only in January.
   ``We haven't proposed anything,'' said Robert Lovell, a vice
president of Orbital Sciences. But, he said, the company has talked
with colleagues about using the transfer stage if the shuttle were
made available.
   ``The TOS could be sent up in the shuttle, astronauts would
attach it to the spacecraft and send it on its way,'' Lovell said.
   Only one transfer orbit stage has been built _ the engineering
model used in qualification tests. Lovell said that's the one that
would be offered for the rescue.
   While the satellite was in a 103 mile by 218 mile orbit, NASA
said it would not consider a rescue. The low point of that orbit
brushes the upper edge of the atmosphere and the satellite was
given only a nine-day life.
   NASA has performed five spectacular space rescues, the latest
this year when it brought back the bus-size Long Duration Exposure
Facility.
   In 1984, astronauts brought back two satellites stranded in a
useless orbit because their attached rockets didn't ignite. Johnson
Space Center spokesman Kyle Herring said that mission, which
involved spacewalks, required nine months of planning.
   Asked what a rescue mission for the Intelsat satellite would
cost, Lovell said the biggest expense would be the shuttle mission.
The transfer orbit stage would require about a third of the space
in the cargo bay, he said.
   In its new orbit, 161 miles at the low point, the Intelsat
satellite can stay in space for months. Moreover, because the
satellite had enough steering fuel to last for 13 years, there is
plenty left to keep it out of the grip of the atmosphere.
   The satellite was propelled into space at a cost of about $270
million in the fourth commercial launch of a payload by a U.S.
company.
   The Intelsat VI spacecraft was intended to transmit three TV
channels and up to 120,000 telephone calls simultaneously. It was
to have eventually replaced two older satellites over the Atlantic.

   Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the
father she loves but has never met to come home Friday, the day
Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in Lebanon.
   The journalist's family, friends and colleagues marked the
anniversary with commemorations and prayers in Washington, New
York, and Cyprus. Yellow ribbons fluttered from trees, signs and
poles in Anderson's hometown of Batavia, N.Y.
   Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest
Anderson's captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the
hostages' release.
   But no message was as poignant the one on television Friday
evening in Lebanon.
   In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter Sulome appeared,
wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given to her at Christmas
in Anderson's name.
   ``I got the bike for Christmas, Daddy. Thank you,'' said Sulome,
who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem faction in Beirut.
   ``I love you, Daddy, come home, please come home. I love you,
Daddy. Come home. Send me to the circus,'' she beseeched. The
videotape was made earlier in the week and shipped to the
television stations in Beirut.
   Lebanese newspapers also published a letter Friday signed
``Sulome and Madeleine,'' from the girl and her mother, Madeleine
Bassil, who wait in Cyprus for Anderson's release.
   ``The world without God is not the world, it's hell. A home
without a husband or father is not a home, it's hell,'' the letter
said.
   ``I am always wondering if you have ever been able to read the
letters sent to you on different occasions, or even if they were
read to you to let you know how much we love you and how different
and difficult life is without you,'' Ms. Bassil wrote.
   ``We are in as much captivity, Terry. Only our living space is
bigger here and it is shared by the millions. I know you will keep
well, I know you will never give up. Until we meet again soon. God
bless you. We love you.''
   Papers published the English text of the letter hoping that
Anderson, who did not know Arabic when he was kidnapped, would be
allowed to read it.
   Anderson, 42, is the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He has been held longer than any of the 18
Western hostages in Lebanon. Most of the others, who include eight
Americans, have been held at least three years and the prayers
offered on Friday were for all the hostages.
   The factions holding captives are affiliated with the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, made up of Shiite Moslem
zealots following the anti-Western teachings of the late Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A Hezbollah prayer leader, speaking at a rally in Lebanon on
Friday, said ``We in Hezbollah are regarded as terrorists and
kidnappers of innocent people. ... America, Israel and France
taught us to kill. They kidnapped us and kidnapped thousands of
people. Our hostages are more than theirs.''
   ``The abduction of one American is the end of the world, but no
one cares about the abduction of a whole nation,'' Sheik Mohammed
Khatoun said as about 2,000 sympathizers chanted Islam's cry of
``Allahu Akbar!''
   The rally was called to mourn five Hezbollah fighters killed in
a clash with Israeli troops in south Lebanon on March 8.
   Bush pledged to work for the hostages' freedom. ``I intend to
keep open lines of communications with all parties, including Iran,
who have influence over hostage takers,'' he said in a letter to
Peggy Say, Anderson's sister.
   But Thursday, the president said there were no immediate
prospects for the hostages' freedom and said he was perplexed by
the recent ``wave of speculation'' about a possible hostage
release. This included reports in Iranian newspapers recently
saying the hostage issue should be resolved.
   However, on Thursday a group holding three American educators
threatened to kill them unless their demands were met. It did not
specify its demands.
   Earlier in the month, another faction denounced media reports of
possible hostage releases and said it had no intention of freeing
its captives.
   Anderson is held by Islamic Jihad. It has demanded the release
of comrades jailed in Kuwait for bombing the U.S. and French
embassies in December 1983.
   Mrs. Say met privately with Bush and his wife at the White
House, then spoke at a ceremony across the street at Lafayette
Park. Directing her remarks to her brothers' captors, she said:
``You complain that your story has not been told and yet the man
who would tell it has been chained to a basement wall for five
years. ...
   ``I don't want to punish them. I don't want to hunt them down. I
just want my brother back. But I'm not going to pay them for doing
so,'' she said.
   Louis D. Boccardi, president and general manager of The
Associated Press, said at the ceremony, ``At this point the
greatest gift we can give him is to press on, to not falter, to
find an honorable way to get the job done. If you know Terry,
that's what he's thinking, too.''
   Those attending included the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a
former hostage who spent time locked up with Anderson before his
release in 1986.
   The other Americans still held hostage are: Thomas Sutherland,
acting dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut;
Frank Herbert Reed, director of the private Lebanon International
School in Beirut; Joseph James Cicippio, acting comptroller of the
American University of Beirut; Edward Austin Tracy, author of
children's books; Jesse Turner, visiting professor of mathematics
and computer science at Beirut University College; Alann Steen,
journalism professor at Beirut University College; and Robert
Polhill, assistant professor of business and lecturer in accounting
at Beirut University College.
   Anderson's friends and colleagues attended a Mass at St.
Patrick's Cathedral in New York. In Tokyo, the Foreign
Correspondents' Club of Japan arranged a Friday night ceremony to
honor Anderson, who worked out of the AP Tokyo bureau from 1977 to
1981.
   Anderson's sister-in-law, Penny Anderson, and a cousin, Carl
Anderson, were among those who attended an interfaith church
service Thursday evening in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park,
N.Y., about 40 miles from Anderson's boyhood home of Batavia.
   In Damascus, former President Jimmy Carter said Friday chances
seem better than ever for the hostages' release and that Syrian
President Hafez Assad pledged anew to help win their freedom.
   Carter, who later arrived in Jordan, said of Anderson, ``My own
conviction is that more opportunities exist now for his release
than ever before.''
   State-run Syrian television broadcast a 20-minute interview with
Mrs. Say, who toured the region last month to explore prospects for
a hostage release.
   She expressed hope the hostages could be released in a way that
would improve relations among America, the Arabs and Iran.

   A spate of shooting attacks against
Greyhound buses left some replacement drivers here nervous,
striking drivers defensive and passengers eyeing the aisle seats
Friday.
   ``I'll sit in the middle. Not in the front and not in the back _
in the middle,'' 19-year-old Jane Smith said as she waited for a
bus that would take her to Huntsville, Ala. ``And I'll sit kind of
low, too,'' she added.
   As union and company negotiators met separately with federal
mediators, a striking driver was arrested in Connecticut in one of
more than a dozen shootings apparently related to the two-week-old
strike.
   Roger D. Cawthra, 44, of Stratford was accused by police of
firing a single shot from a large-caliber semiautomatic gun into
the luggage compartment of a Greyhound bus outside Farmington on
Monday. None of the 19 passengers was injured.
   Cawthra, a Greyhound driver for three years, was arraigned on
charges of first-degree criminal mischief, a felony, and three
misdemeanor counts: first-degree reckless endangerment, unlawful
discharge of a firearm and unlawful discharge of a firearm on a
public highway. He didn't enter a plea, but has declared he is
innocent.
   Police said Cawthra, who was ordered held on $100,000 bond, was
identified by the bus driver from a videotape of strikers taken by
company security forces.
   Also Friday, a bullet fired from a passing car hit the
windshield of a bus outside Phoenix, said Greyhound spokeswoman Ann
Wheat. No one was injured. Ms. Wheat said three shots were fired;
police said there was one.
   In Chattanooga, police escorted Greyhound buses within city
limits _ a precaution prompted by two shootings in two days.
Neither resulted in injuries. The first shooting occurred
Wednesday, when a bullet hit the door of a bus on a highway after
it left the Chattanooga terminal. On Thursday, a shot struck a bus
windshield. There were no arrests.
   A telephoned bomb threat to a Greyhound bus yard in Los Angeles
on Friday prompted evacuation of replacement workers and pickets
alike, said police Sgt. Tom Jones. The anonymous caller said there
was a bomb in the lobby, and in the search that followed bomb squad
members found a suitcase that emitted a ticking sound in the cargo
hold of a bus.
   That turned out to be a lost suitcase with an alarm clock
inside, he said.
   Negotiators for Greyhound Lines Inc. and the Amalgamated Council
of Greyhound Local Unions met separately Friday in Tucson, Ariz.,
in preparation for face-to-face talks Saturday.
   It would be the first meeting of the adversaries since 6,300
drivers and about 3,000 other members of the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions struck March 2 over wages and grievance
procedures. Neither side commented on Friday's meetings.
   The Dallas-based company carried 47,685 passengers on Thursday,
38.5 percent of the number it carried the same day last year,
according to spokeswoman Lyn Graley.
   Greyhound Chairman Fred. G. Currey has accused the union of
``terrorism'' in the attacks, but union leaders note none have been
proven to be the work of strikers.
   One man has been killed in the walkout, a striking driver
crushed by a bus on a picket line in Redding, Calif., on March 3.
   Striking drivers in Chattanooga on Friday said they shouldn't be
blamed for the shootings.
   ``There are less than 20 union employees here, and we work a
six-hour shift (on the picket line),'' said J.W. Kirk, a Greyhound
driver for 27 years.
   ``After working six hours, you don't feel up to going out there
and trying to hide (to shoot at a bus) and all that sort of stuff.
And we are all family men.''
   Some replacement drivers hired by the company said the attacks
made them nervous.
   ``It's a thought, but it's not something my thoughts dwell on,''
said driver Ron Edwards, 36, during a stop at the Chattanooga
terminal on a run between Atlanta and Chicago.
   ``I'm here to do a job,'' Edwards said. ``I hate that I had to
get it because of the strike, I hated to walk across the picket
line. But I was hungry.''

<TEXT>
   A former ally of President Kenneth Kaunda
denounced the prominent African leader Friday as a dictator and
called for democracy during a ruling party convention.
   The convention had been called to decide whether to keep
one-party rule or allow multiparty democracy, but Kaunda announced
Wednesday that the current system, in place since 1973, would
remain.
   The attack on Kaunda came from Sikota Wina, who was once a
Cabinet minister and belonged to the central committee of the
ruling United National Independence Party.
   Wina made his criticisms in an open letter circulated Friday
among 1,000 delegates to the fifth national convention of the
party, the only lawful political movement in Zambia, a landlocked
nation in southern Africa.
   Kaunda led the British colony of northern Rhodesia to
independence as Zambia in 1964.
   Wina, drummed out of the party over 10 years ago for criticizing
authoritarian rule, slammed Kaunda's homegrown philosophy of
humanism.
   In his letter, Wina said, ``The country at present is run as a
dictatorship masked behind the cloak of a meaningless slogan called
`humanism.'''
   He also said ``the top leadership and their offspring'' had
committed ``economic sabotage.'' He said they feel they are ``above
the law.''
   Wina said the convention should restore the multiparty system
inherited from Zambia's colonial ruler. He also called for a limit
in the terms a president can serve.
   Wina has made few public statements since 1986 when he was
detained, first in India and then at home, on accusations of drug
trafficking. He was later freed because of lack of evidence, and he
has generally concentrated on private business since then.

<HEAD>Fort Bragg NCO Said Investigated For Panama Incident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army is investigating allegations that a
prisoner was shot to death during the U.S. invasion of Panama, a
military journal said Friday.
   Fifty-nine other incidents also are being investigated,
including suicides and an accidental killing, Army Times said. All
were described as happening in ``a combat situation.''
   Army Times is an independent weekly. The publication provided
advance copies of an article on the Panama invasions to appear in
Monday's edition.
   Col. William Mulvey, chief of public affairs for the Army, said,
``They've got it wrong.'' But he declined to detail what was wrong
with the article.
   Eight of the incidents involved deaths, including one in which a
senior non-commissioned officer allegedly shot a prisoner and beat
another after a skirmish at a roadblock, the journal reported.
   The NCO, said to have been a member of the 82nd Airborne
Division from Fort Bragg, N.C., was part of a roadblock that
stopped a car following the U.S. invasion on Dec. 20.
   Someone inside the car threw a hand grenade at the soldiers, who
then fired into the car, killing some occupants, according to Army
Times' account.
   The remaining occupants surrendered, got out and were taken
prisoner.
   The NCO allegedly shot one of the prisoners, killing him, and
severely beat another, according to the weekly.
   Other incidents involved the accidental killing of one U.S.
soldier by another and two suicides, the publication said.
   In all, 21 formal investigations by the Criminal Investigation
Command have been opened, Army Times said.

<HEAD>Mandela Calls for More Anti-Apartheid Pressure</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela urged an increase in
international pressure on South Africa's white government Friday,
the same day President F.W. de Klerk announced talks have been
arranged with the African National Congress.
   Mandela, vice president of the ANC, made no direct reference to
the announcement in his speech to a rally of about 13,000 at
Stockholm's Globe arena.
   Instead, he repeated his anti-apartheid group's conditions for
negotiations with the South African government and called for
renewed pressure through international sanctions.
   ``When the water is about to boil, it is foolish to turn off the
heat,'' he declared.
   The rally, held in Mandela's honor, capped his five-day visit to
Sweden to meet with African National Congress president Oliver
Tambo, who is recovering from a stroke. During the international
tour, Mandela also visited Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and the
Netherlands.
   Mandela made the trip after he was freed from a South African
prison in February. He served 27 years in prison on charges of
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government.
   He shortened his visit to Sweden, originally intended to last
until Saturday, to leave late Friday by chartered plane direct for
Johannesburg to attend a rally in his honor there.
   Though he is expected to lead his group's delegation at talks
with the government announced by de Klerk for April 11, Mandela
said nothing of those plans Friday.
   Met by a standing ovation, Mandela said, ``The fundamental
aspects of apartheid are intact, but there are signs the apartheid
system is about to crumble.'' Apartheid is the South African system
of racial discrimination.
   In his 15-minute speech, he repeated conditions for talks
demanded earlier by the ANC: total lifting of the state of
emergency in South Africa, freeing of all political prisoners, and
repeal of repressive legislation.
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson, who attended the rally, promised
in a brief speech that the Swedish government would stiffen its
sanctions. He gave no details.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Proposes First Bill of Rights for Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Friday released a proposed bill
of rights to reassure Hong Kong residents that China will respect
their political and economic system for 50 years after the
territory reverts to Chinese rule.
   However, lawmaker Martin Lee called the document
``unacceptable'' because he said it could be changed by future
legislatures.
   Beijing has pledged to guard human rights in Hong Kong and
retain this British colony's legal and capitalistic systems for a
half-century after it assumes control of Hong Kong in 1997.
   The proposed bill of rights, Hong Kong's first, amends the
colonial constitution to incorporate the provisions of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
   ``The bill of rights, as the embodiment of the covenant, will be
the benchmark by which all laws enacted in Hong Kong will be
tested,'' said Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen.
   Suen said it would be almost ``impossible and very complicated''
to repeal the bill.
   However, the bill was criticized by some members of the Hong
Kong lawmaking Legislative Council.
   Legislator Jimmy McGregor told the government-funded Radio Hong
Kong that the draft was not in the best interest of the people. He
said it could be easily repealed by the government after 1997.
   The bill allows for anyone who feels his rights have been
violated to seek redress in any court or tribunal in the territory.
   In an emergency, the bill gives the government the right to take
actions that would infringe on the Civil Rights Convenant. But
these measures could not restrict certain basic rights, such as the
right of life or freedom of conscience and religion.
   The government hopes to enact the bill in July.
   It decided to consolidate all the human rights provisions from
various ordinances into a bill of rights because of mounting
concern in Hong Kong that China would renege its pledges after 1997.
   Confidence in those pledges has evaporated since Beijing's June
3-4 military crackdown on the student-led Chinese movement for
democratic reforms.

   A school bus carrying 43 pupils collided
with a truck at a downtown intersection Friday. At least 12
children were injured but only one was admitted to a hospital.
   Bus driver Robert Conway, 30, and a witness said the bus and a
truck were both headed northbound when the truck, on the bus's
right side, tried to make a left turn.
   Aboard the bus were 43 third- through fifth-graders from Clinton
Elementary School, two teachers and the driver, said one of the
teachers, Samella Potter.
   The truck driver ``must have decided he needed to make a
lefthand turn, and that's just what he did, right in front of that
school bus,'' said Marie Forker, a witness who was driving behind
the truck. ``When it happened (the pupils') heads just surged to
the front.''
   Conway said the bus was returning to Clinton Elementary after
taking the children to see a play downtown.
   The truck driver, Harry C. Myers, 19, of Pickerington, was cited
for making an improper left turn.
   The owner of the truck, Diewald and Pope Inc., a mechanical
contractor, declined to comment.
   Children's Hospital spokeswoman Pam Barber said the hospital
examined 12 pupils. Ten were treated and released, one was admitted
in fair condition with a possible neck injury, and one was held for
further examination. She said the children mostly complained of
head and neck injuries.

<HEAD>Giant Cocaine Bust Yields Guilty Pleas _ to Possessing 1 Ounce</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOEL WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men arrested in a nine-ton cocaine
bust _ described as the nation's second-largest _ pleaded guilty
Friday to a reduced charge of possessing less than one ounce of
cocaine.
   Prosecutor Ed Cyganiewicz said he agreed to the plea bargain
because he feared the state court jury might give a lenient
sentence or even probation. Jurors might have been sympathetic
because the defendants worked only as ``mules,'' or laborers, for
drug kingpins who aren't in custody, he said.
   Defense attorneys welcomed the plea bargain, entered in the
middle of a trial after the prosecution rested its case based on
the seizure of 18,360 pounds of cocaine at a farm house last year.
   ``You've got to admit there's a big difference between 18,360
pounds and one ounce,'' said defense attorney Hector Villarreal
said.
   Defendants Hermenegildo Sosa Rivas, 51, and Guadencio Garcia
Garcia, 39, both Mexican citizens, face two to 20 years in prison
and fined $10,000 on the second-degree felony charge.
   The original first-degree felony charge of possessing more than
400 grams could have brought them life in prison and a $100,000
fine.
   Under Texas law, possession of less than 28 grams _ one ounce _
of cocaine is a second-degree felony carrying a two- to 20-year
sentence. Possession of more than an ounce is a first-degree
felony, with harsher penalties that increase further if the amount
exceeds 400 grams, or about nine-tenths of a pound.
   Texas Department of Public Safety narcotics agents arrested Sosa
and Garcia on Oct. 4, 1989, during the siezure in Harlingen in
southern Texas.
   The only larger U.S. cocaine seizure, the department said, was a
20-ton cache found in a Los Angeles-area warehouse the week before.
   The prosecutor said he would ask Judge Darrell Hester to impose
the maximum penalty of 20 years at the sentencing, scheduled for
May 4.
   Defense attorney Villarreal maintained that Sosa and Garcia took
a job as day laborers Oct. 4, unaware the job was packing cocaine
for shipment. He said drug smugglers locked them in the house after
they arrived.
   The prosecutor countered that the house was unlocked, and the
men could have escaped any time or telephoned for help during the
four hours they worked at the house.

<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vinicio Cerezo gave his backing
Friday to talks with leftist guerrillas on ending 30 years of
fighting, dropping a demand that the rebels first lay down their
arms.
   A member of the National Reconciliation Commission announced
Thursday that it would hold its second meeting with the rebels
March 27 to March 29 in Oslo, Norway. The commission was set up as
part of a regional peace plan.
   ``We are going to listen to the proposal of the subversives,''
Cerezo said at a news conference Friday.
   ``At this historic moment, things are changing in the region,''
he said. ``What happened in Nicaragua, the softening of the
attitude of the (Salvadoran) Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front and the willingness to talk with the Guatemalan guerrilla
groups open very important expectations.''
   The leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua, who had provided a haven
for Salvadoran and Guatemalan rebels, lost Feb. 25 elections to the
U.S.-backed opposition.
   In El Salvador, leftist rebels said Tuesday they've called off
assassination attempts on civilian officials and attacks on public
transport to show they're serious about resuming peace talks with
the rightist government.
   Speaking about the situation in Guatemala, Defense Minister Gen.
Hector Alejandro Gramajo said at Friday's news conference, ``If the
subversives are not doing this for international publicity, we
believe that the talks ... can move forward.''
   The government leadership earlier had insisted the rebels lay
down their arms before talks get under way.
   Both Cerezo and Gramajo said Friday they are willing to renew
contact with the rebels if they showed willingness to negotiate.
The reconciliation commission is trying to determine whether that
is true.
   The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union has battled to
overthrow a succession of military-dominated governments. More than
80,000 people have been killed in the conflict, most of them Indian
peasants.

<TEXT>
   The lone co-defendant of Manuel Noriega in a
Tampa drug and money-laundering case once accompanied the ousted
Panamanian strongman to Washington to meet with Oliver North and
William Casey, an attorney said.
   But Enrique ``Kiki'' Pretelt, a Panamanian jeweler, went along
on the 1983 trip purely to socialize, according to defense attorney
George Tragos.
   Pretelt also went with Noriega to Havana in 1984 for talks with
Cuban President Fidel Castro. Again, Pretelt claims it was merely
in a social capacity.
   Tragos filed a motion Thursday in federal court in Tampa seeking
access to classified government documents he says will show his
client's frequent contacts with Noriega didn't involve drug
smuggling or money laundering.
   Pretelt and Noriega were indicted in 1988 on charges of taking
bribes from Tampa-based drug smugglers to help ferry $300 million
worth of Colombian marijuana safely through Panama.
   ``The government's case involves guilt by association, but only
the government has information which can disprove these
allegations,'' Tragos said.
   Pretelt went underground soon after the U.S. invasion of Panama
on Dec. 20. Noriega also fled, taking refuge for 10 days at a
Vatican diplomatic building before surrendering to U.S. agents on
Jan. 3.
   Pretelt, 47, surrendered to FBI agents in Panama on Jan. 17 and
was brought to Tampa. He pleaded innocent in January and is being
held at an undisclosed site.
   Federal investigators are thought to be trying to strike a deal,
but Tragos says he's preparing for trial.
   Noriega is in prison near Miami awaiting trial there next
January on drug-smuggling charges. A federal indictment in Miami
says Noriega was paid off by the Medillin Cartel of Colombian drug
smugglers to allow use of Panama for shipping drugs and drug money.
   That indictment says Noriega went to Cuba for a meeting that
Castro mediated with cocaine traffickers who were upset with the
Panama military after a cocaine laboratory was raided.
   According to Tragos' motions here, Noriega went to Washington in
November 1983 to seek U.S. approval for the election of Nicolas
Ardito Barletta as Panama's president.
   Noriega met separately with former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North
and other members of the National Security Council; with Casey,
late head of the CIA and other agency officials; and with Langhorn
E. Motley, then assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, the motions state.
   Pretelt ``was not present at any of the official discussions and
was again only present for social gatherings with General
Noriega,'' Tragos wrote.
   He wants records from the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International that he claims will prove Pretelt wasn't involved in
any illegal activity. The bank pleaded guilty to money-laundering
charges in January and agreed to forfeit a record $14 million plus
interest.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of college
financial aid applications nationwide are being delayed because of
processing problems at the firm that analyzes them for schools, a
company official said Friday.
   ``What would take two to three weeks to process at this time of
the year is now running four to five weeks,'' said Kathleen
Brouder, director of information services at the College
Scholarship Service, part of the Educational Testing Service.
   The data processing center is the financial aid division of the
College Board, and is the starting point for financial aid
applications for about 3 million students every year.
   The service analyzes financial aid applications, which detail
family assets and income, to make sure they comply with federal
financial aid rules and determine how much aid students should
receive, then sends the analysis to the colleges chosen by the
students.
   Ms. Brouder said the delays were partly caused by new federal
procedures and partly by an engineering problem several weeks ago
in a scanner used to review applications automatically. The firm
had to switch to a slower, manual process for several days while
the scanner was repaired.
   She said this is the peak time of year for financial aid
applications, when students must meet college deadlines to apply
for aid for the coming school year.
   Colleges are being notified of the delays, Ms. Brouder said.
   So far this year, the center has received 1.1 million
applications, she said.

<TEXT>
   Deputy Prime Minister Devi Lal resigned
Friday, creating turmoil in the governing National Front coalition
and giving Prime Minister V.P. Singh his first political crisis
after three months in office.
   Devi Lal, 75, quit because he felt some senior coalition leaders
were out to malign him and his son, according to United Press of
India news agency.
   It said he sent a letter of resignation to Singh, but no
immediate word came that Singh accepted it.
   Newspapers and politicians blamed Devi Lal's son, Om Prakash
Chauthala, for violence and vote-rigging in last month's elections
to state assemblies.
   Chauthala was named chief minister of northern Haryana state
last December after Devi Lal resigned the post to join the federal
Cabinet. By law, Chauthala then had to be elected to the stte
assembly to keep his job as chief minister.
   Voting on Feb. 27 was marked by violence that killed at least 13
people. New elections were ordered.
   Industries Minister Ajit Singh, known to be a strong rival of
Devi Lal, demanded that Chauthala resign ``on moral grounds.''
   The National Front is a centrist alliance dominated by Janata
Dal, to which Devi Lal, V.P. Singh and Ajit Singh (no relation)
belong.
   Whether Devi Lal's resignation would trigger a split in Janata
Dal was not immediately clear, but he has a strong following in the
party.
   Also on Friday, Atinder Pal Singh, a Sikh facing trial on
charges of masterminding bomb attacks, was brought from jail by
armed police and was sworn in as a member of the lower house of
Parliament.
   The police did not enter Parliament, and Atinder Pal Singh was
returned to jail after the ceremony.
   Atinder Pal Singh, no relation to the Cabinet ministers, won his
seat in Nov. 22-26 general elections while remaining in prison.
   He also was implicated in the 1984 assassination of Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi, but those charges were dropped after the
election.

<TEXT>
   Yellow ribbons hung from trees, signs and
telephone poles in Terry Anderson's hometown Friday as relatives,
friends and strangers fasted and prayed for the release of the
journalist held hostage in Lebanon.
   A 24-hour fast begun by about 180 people Thursday night in the
Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park, 40 miles to the west, was broken
Friday night ata service at the Genesee Country Mall in downtown
Batavia.
   ``I hereby commit myself to one day of prayer and fasting for
Terry's release and the release of all innocent human beings held
hostage anywhere in the world,'' read pledges signed by the fasters
on Friday, the fifth anniversary of Anderson's abduction in Beirut.
   They included Penny Anderson, Terry's sister-in-law, and Carl
Anderson, a cousin, two of the few relatives still living in this
town of 17,000 in New York's dairy country. Also fasting was Anne
Zickl, who has never met Anderson but has become a leader of local
efforts to win his release.
   ``Terry is dying a slow death in Lebanon,'' Stephen Hawley, a
Genesee County legislator and high school classmate of Anderson's,
said at the service here.
   ``The time has come for all governments who have any influence
over the captors to heed our pleas and our prayers. Release Terry
Anderson. Release all the hostages now,'' Hawley said.
   Other ceremonies were held Friday in Lorain, Ohio, Anderson's
birthplace, and in Washington, D.C., where the humanitarian group
No Greater Love held a service in Lafayette Park across from the
White House. In Tokyo, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan
held a ceremony Friday night for the abducted newsman, who worked
in The Associated Press' Tokyo bureau from 1977 to 1981.
   Anderson, 42, is the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. He has been held longer than any of the 18
Western hostages in Lebanon. Most of the others have been held at
least three years and the prayers offered on Friday also were for
the other hostages.
   Anderson left Batavia in 1965 to join the Marine Corps. His
subsequent career as a journalist kept him abroad for most of his
working life; his sister, Peggy Say, said the last time Anderson
visited Batavia may have been for their mother's funeral in 1977.
   ``When you're kind of an international journalist, you don't
really have a home,'' Mrs. Zickl said. ``He would tell Peggy that
wherever she was, that was home, because she was this mom figure
after his mother died.''
   Nevertheless, the hometown tie, admiration for Say and outrage
over the hostage-taking prompted many residents who had never met
Anderson to band together to support his cause.
   The idea of the 24-hour fast for the hostages was conceived by
Buffalo Area Metropolitan Ministries, an ecumenical group, and was
adopted enthusiastically by Say, who fasted while she attended
ceremonies in Washington.
   The Rev. Francis ``Butch'' Mazur, a Roman Catholic priest who
organized the Orchard Park service, told worshipers that fasting
``is a transformation of self, which leads to a transformation of
society, which takes its shape from our lives.''
   He urged all who support the hostages to make some sacrifice
during the day.
   ``It may mean abstaining from one of the three meals that you
would have in the next 24 hours,'' Mazur said Thursday night. ``For
little kids, it may mean fasting from candy or soda pop. For
others, it may mean fasting from television or coffee or caffeine.''

<TEXT>
   An increase in manufacturing helped the
Mexican economy grow last year at nearly twice the rate forecasted
by government analysts, the Planning Department said Friday.
   The announcement was another indication that Mexico's economy is
pulling out of a protracted slump that began when world oil prices
skidded in 1982.
   ``This favorable result was accompanied by a reduction of
inflation to nearly one-third that observed a year earlier,'' the
government news release said.
   Inflation in 1989 was 19.7 percent, compared to 51.7 percent for
1988, the Bank of Mexico reported.
   The gross domestic product grew 2.9 percent in 1989, based on
preliminary data from the National Statistics, Geography and
Information Institute, the Planning Department said.
   Officials had forecast a 1.5 percent growth in the GDP for the
year. However, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari estimated in
November at his first state-of-the-nation speech that 1989 growth
would be 2.5 to 3 percent.
   Manufacturers, including the country's many factories dotting
the 1,950-mile U.S.-Mexico border, were responsible for the
increased 1989 output, while farmers and ranchers, forestry and
fishing businesses produced less than in 1988, the statement said.
   It blamed shrinkage in the other sectors on ``adverse climatic
conditions.''
   Growth in manufacturing was 6 percent, while agricultural output
fell 3.1 percent, the department reported.
   The GDP grew 1.1 percent in 1988, and 1.5 percent in 1987, the
government newspaper El Nacional said.
   In 1986, the GDP dropped by 3.7 percent, compared with a 2.5
percent increase in 1985, according to the Bank of Mexico.

   A Canadian dog food manufacturer said Friday at

   Chuck Martin, a spokesman for Martin Feed Mills Ltd., said high

(198-pound) bags of its Techni-Cal Growth puppy food.
   ``We have not ruled out sabotage as the levels of monensin found
were far higher than allowable for poultry feeds and the substance
is not allowed in pet foods,'' Martin was quoted as telling The
Canadian Press from company operations at Elmira, Ontario.
   The company also makes poultry feed, but in a separate building.
   Martin Feed ordered a recall of 1,263 bags of the puppy food
distributed in Canada east of Thunder Bay, Ontario. An additional
100 bags were sent to U.S. distributors.
   The contaminated product carries lot number 0110 and was made
Jan. 9-10.
   The first dog reported to have died was a Labrador retriever
from Limehouse, which died shortly after it was brought to an
animal clinic Tuesday.
   Tests on Friday confirmed the presence of the vaccine in the
animal, which had eaten two meals made from the contaminated food.
   Other deaths were reported in Toronto and neighboring
Mississauga.
   Techni-Cal Growth is an expensive brand for puppies and
lactating mothers often used by breeders and trainers. It is
available only from pet food suppliers and veterinarians.
   Martin Feed Mills notified Canadian dealers, breeders and
veterinarians. Bags sold in the United States were being traced.
   About 40 percent of the contaminated lot has been returned so
far, said company sales manager Lynette Taylor.

   The 253-year-old Charitable Irish
Society is marking St. Patrick's Day by taking a bold step:
inaugurating its first woman president.
   ``They're quite pleased. I think they feel it's about time,''
said William Connaughton, a former president of the Boston-based
society, which calls itself the oldest Irish immigrant organization
in the United States.
   Catherine B. Shannon, a Westfield State College professor, was
scheduled to be installed Saturday as president. It was a major
development for a society that didn't admit women to its ranks
until the early 1980s.
   ``I think that what happened was there were a lot of men who
were coming onto the board who were in their 40s and 50s who said,
`This is ridiculous. Stag dinners are not that much fun,' ''
Shannon said.
   Shannon said Irish history is her field of study and she also
has researched the role of women in modern Ireland, giving her a
unique perspective in her new job.
   ``What I think is most important is to have us focus on what our
tradition has been; to be of service to those who are in distress
or need,'' she said this week. ``I think women are perhaps uniquely
prepared to recognize that very quickly and early on.''
   The society dates back to 1737, when it was founded by mainly
Protestant businessmen in Boston to help immigrant Irish of both
faiths.
   Shannon, who joined the society in 1985, said she hoped to lead
the organization in recruiting more young members and reaching out
to recent immigrants.

<HEAD>Roh Replaces Economic Minister in Cabinet Shakeup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo on Saturday
replaced his economic minister in a major Cabinet reshuffle
expected to herald a push to speed the growth of South Korea's
economy.
   The reshuffle, affecting 15 of 22 posts, has been expected since
last month's merger of Roh's governing party with two centrist
opposition groups. The alliance resulted in a powerful conservative
party giving the president a comfortable parliamentary majority.
   Chief presidential spokesman Lee Soo-jung said Saturday's
shakeup was aimed at invigorating national politics as Roh enters
the second half of his five-year term ending in 1993.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and his entire 22-member Cabinet
resigned Friday to give Roh a free hand to reorganize the
government. Kang was renamed prime minister of the new Cabinet on
Saturday.
   However, Roh replaced most of the Cabinet's economics officials,
including Economic Planning Minister Cho Soon, who is a deputy
premier.
   Lee Seung-yun, 58, a former finance minister who served under
ex-President Chun Doo-hwan, succeeded Cho as the nation's top
economic planner.
   His appointment is expected to bring a considerable change in
South Korea's economic policy, which has put emphasis on
distribution rather than growth. Lee, a respected economist, is
known as an advocate of a growth-oriented policy.
   ``My first job will be to look into the problems of our economy
many people say is in a crisis and prepare appropriate measures,''
Lee told reporters after the reshuffle.
   Cho and his economic team have been criticized for a series of
policy failures that aggravated land speculation, increased
inflation and slowed exports. Korean exports in the first two
months of this year decreased 2.5 percent to $8.7 billion from a
year ago.
   Cho's successor declined to provide details but said he was
willing to announce new measures ``as soon as possible to rectify
problems and adjust the course of the Korean economy.''
   The state television KBS said the new economic planning minister
would push a series of bold measures to encourage investment and
stimulate exports.
   In Saturday's reorganization, the first since December 1988, Roh
kept Foreign Minister Choi Ho-joong, Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon
and several other non-political members.
   Ahn Ung-mo, a deputy director of the Agency for National
Security Planning, the government's main intelligence body, was
named the new home minister who controls the nation's
130,000-member national police.
   Park Pil-soo, a former government economic official and now
president of Hankook University of Foreign Studies, became the
minister of trade and industry. Chung Young-ui, chief of the
Securities Supervisory Agency, was appointed as finance minister.
   The reorganization also affected the presidential staff and
several less political cabinet-level posts handling environmental
and legal government affairs.
   Several ex-opposition lawmakers who joined in the new governing
Democratic Liberal Party were given non-political Cabinet posts in
the reorganization.
   Roh, a former army general, was elected president in December
1987 following a split of two opposition parties. He replaced Chun,
who called the vote following mass demonstrations to demand
democratic reforms and an end to autocratic rule.
   On Friday, about 3,000 radical students, some shouting ``Down
with the conservative party!'' rallied at four universities in
Seoul to protest the reorganization.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge struck down most of the
Navy's program of random drug tests for 80,000 civilian employees,
saying the Pentagon failed to limit the practice to jobs affecting
safety or military secrets.
   U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen, in a ruling made public
Friday, also overturned the Navy's plan for drug testing any of its
325,000 civilian employees who cause an accident involving injury
or property damage.
   He said the Navy failed to limit post-accident testing to
serious accidents and gave local commanders too much authority to
decide who would be tested.
   The ruling is one of a series of decisions from lower federal
courts on drug testing programs ordered for all federal agencies
under President Reagan in 1986. The Supreme Court upheld testing of
some railway workers and Customs Service job applicants last year
but didn't rule on random drug testing.
   ``This decision proves that they'll not allow the government to
subject federal workers to agency drug testing programs without
adequate justifications,'' said Diane Witiak of the American
Federation of Government Employees, which represents 74,000
civilian Navy workers. ``The court is looking at individual job
duties.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney George Stoll said the government
wouldn't comment Friday.
   Jensen had blocked the entire Navy civilian drug testing program
just before it was to take effect in January. His new ruling
appeared to allow just a small fraction of the random testing
program to go into effect, though neither side in the case could
provide any figures Friday.
   Jensen described as overly broad the Navy's stated
justifications for random tests for 80,000 workers in 45 job
categories. Those criteria include the workers' relation to the
operation or maintenance of equipment, national security, public
health and safety, protection of life and property, or drug and
alcohol rehabilitation.
   The judge, however, upheld random testing of some of the 80,000
in certain job classes, including law enforcement officers,
firefighters, drivers, and staff with access to top-secret
information. He also allowed testing of any Navy employee based on
reasonable suspicion of current drug use.
   For example, he said, ``national security'' covers not only
employees with access to top-secret information, but also those
involved in a broad range of policy- and planning-related work;
``public health and safety'' includes lab technicians and dental
hygienists, and ``protection of life and property'' includes
record-keepers for rail lines.
   ``The Navy interests are so broadly defined as to describe
virtually any duties of civilian Navy employees,'' Jensen said.
   Only 80,000 employees considered to have the most sensitive jobs
out of the Navy's total of 325,000 employees were targeted by the
proposed random testing program.
   In a separate ruling, Jensen prohibited post-accident drug
testing of the 5,800 civil service employees of the federal Office
of Personnel Management. He said OPM failed to limit the program to
employees who actually cause accidents.

<TEXT>
   Hank Gathers, the college basketball star who
collapsed during a tournament game and died last week, was killed
by heart disease, according to autopsy results released Thursday.
   The Loyola Marymount University center didn't have any trace of
illegal drugs in his system, the Los Angeles County Coroner's
office reported.
   Gathers, the second player ever to lead college basketball in
both scoring and rebounding in the same season, collapsed on his
home court March 4, moments after sinking a slam dunk in a game
against the University of Portland.
   The 23-year-old Philadelphia native died of idiopathic
cardiomyopathy, or inflammation and scarring of the heart muscle,
said coroner's spokesman Bob Dambacher.
   ``Toxological tests revealed that no drugs nor medications were
found,'' said a coroner's press release.
   Further tests were planned to determine if Gathers had been
taking medication prescribed for an irregular heartbeat diagnosed
after Gathers collapsed on the court Dec. 9.
   In the days before he died, Gathers was said to have asked
doctors to reduce the dosage because it made him sluggish. He
reportedly complained he was unable to perform at the level that
made him college basketball's leading scorer and rebounder during
the 1988-89 season.
   He was considered a certain first-round pick in the next
National Basketball Association draft.
   Dambacher said medical examiners hadn't determined what caused
Gathers' heart condition. But Stephen Berens, a cardiologist in
Santa Monica, said it was likely the result of a viral infection,
possibly brought on by the flu.
   Loyola's Lions, ranked 21st in the nation, were scheduled to
play a first-round National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament game Friday against 24th-ranked New Mexico State.

   A Delta Airlines pilot who reported smoke
aboard his Hawaii-bound airliner turned it around shortly after
takeoff Thursday and made an emergency landing at Los Angeles
International Airport, authorities said.
   No one was injured and passengers walked off the Lockheed L-1011
at an airport boarding gate without using emergency chutes, said
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elly Brekke.
   Delta Flight 1571, en route to Maui with 278 people aboard, was
over the Pacific Ocean about 30 miles west of the airport when the
pilot reported smoke, Brekke said. He requested permission to
return to the airport immediately, she said.
   ``The pilot turned around, dumped fuel over the ocean and
returned straight to the airport,'' Brekke said.
   Delta spokeswoman Glenda Hatchett-Johnson said one of the
plane's flight crew checked the passenger section after a smoke
alarm sounded and discovered ``what he called a thin haze in the
air'' toward the back of the plane.
   ``Just to be safe the crew decided to return to the airport,''
she said.
   The cause of the smoke had not been determined by late
afternoon, said Fred O'Donnell, an FAA spokesman in Los Angeles.

<HEAD>Store Employee Faces Felony Charge for Selling 2 Live Crew Album</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SARASOTA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 19-year-old record store employee was
arrested on a felony charge Thursday for selling a copy of the
controversial rap album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' to an
11-year-old girl.
   Chauncey Reese, an employee at Sarasota's ``Tracks'' record
store, may be one of the first people arrested in Florida for
selling the recording by the Miami group 2 Live Crew, said Sarasota
Police spokesman Russ Nugent.
   ``I'm just glad that someone has decided to do something,
whatever it takes, to keep this trash out of the hands of minors.
I'm just elated,'' said the girl's mother, Ann Skolnick.
   Reese, who is accused of selling the Miami rap group's tape to
the girl in January, was taken into custody at 3 p.m. Thursday
after police investigated a complaint by the girl's mother. He was
later released on his own recognizance.
   ``She felt that the lyrics were obscene and had no business
being listened to by her 11-year-old daughter,'' said Nugent. He
did not know of any other such arrest in the state involving the
rap group's recordings.
   The state attorney's office decided to charge Reese with one
felony count of selling harmful materials to minors, rather than a
misdemeanor obscenity charge, which would call for less jail time
and a smaller fine, Nugent said.
   The double-album was pulled from store shelves across the state
after Gov. Bob Martinez asked a state prosecutor to consider
branding the record obscene. The prosecutor later said that ruling
would have to come from local officials.
   A judge in Broward County said there was probable cause to rule
the record obscene, and deputies there told store owners they would
be prosecuted if they didn't pull it off their shelves.
   A sanitized version of the record, titled ``As Clean as They
Wanna Be,'' is still carried by many stores, but sales have lagged
behind the ``Nasty'' version.
   Telephone messages left late Thursday at Reese's home were not
immediately returned.

   Geoff Hoyle is a scholar but more important for
audiences, he's exceedingly funny.
   The English performer's ``Feast of Fools,'' which he also wrote,
opened off-Broadway Thursday night at the Westside Arts Theater.
   It keeps an audience laughing all evening.
   One example. Two tuxedoed waiters, one haughty and the other a
clumsy slob, take turns appearing from behind a center screen. They
finally fight _ behind the screen, of course. The audience sees
Hoyle's head sticking out from behind the screen, on the floor with
a foot bearing down on his neck.
   Rather than verbal jokes, most of the evening consists of such
visual humor. Some of it would look familiar to those who recall
the clowns of vaudeville and burlesque. But Hoyle is fresh with old
material as well as new, and makes it all funny.
   Hoyle, who has studied mime and theater and whose childhood
heros were variety show comics, divides his work into eight parts,
relating fools through the ages. One of the fool's functions, he
writes in program notes, was to mock the establishment, as the
court jester who sometimes was the only person able to tell the
king some basic truths.
   The ``Feast of Fools'' sketch includes some audience
participation. Hoyle designated part of the audience as bishops,
himself as bishop of fools in the annual festival and the rest of
the audience as 12th-century French peasants who hurl imaginary
dung balls at the bishops.
   Next came two characters from 16th-century Italian commedia
dell'arte. One equated wealth and virility, which Hoyle said in his
opening remarks was ``a silly Renaissance conceit with no relevance
to the man of today.''
   The performer often used masks over the top half of his face.
Some sketches contained broad vulgarity, such as pratfalls caused
by slipping on his own spit.
   Act 2 entered present times _ a tedious old gent on a stage
making a meandering plea for funds, telling a long joke without a
punchline. He'd drive you crazy in life but Hoyle's audience was
weak with laughter. He was followed by balloon-nosed Mr. Sniff, who
found bad smells from one side of the audience and good from the
other, and by ``Spare,'' in which Hoyle donned a coat, over three
pants legs and three feet, and danced.
   ``Feast of Fools'' has been performed in La Jolla and San
Francisco, Calif., Washington, Toronto and Seattle. Producers here
are Raymond L. Gaspard, Charles H. Duggan and Drew Dennett by
arrangement with Randall Kline.

   The chairman of Greyhound Lines Inc. on Thursday
accused his company's union of terrorism and said he had little
hope that renewed negotiations would lead to a new contract for
striking bus drivers.
   ``I believe these union leaders ... think they can win this
strike through violence, terrorism and intimidation and if they
think that, then I have very low expectations'' for the talks,
which resume Saturday in Arizona, said Fred G. Currey.
   Since the walkout began March 2, there have been 14 shooting
attacks on buses, 46 bomb threats recorded but no bombs found, and
numerous other incidents of vandalism or threats, including vacant
buses set on fire, company officials said.
   Union leaders say they have disavowed the violence, though
Jeffrey Nelson, spokesman for the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound
Local Unions, conceded that union members may be responsible for
some of the incidents.
   ``We have repeatedly gone to union officials at the local level,
imploring them to let their own members know that this is not a way
to solve a strike,'' he said.
   In the latest violence, a bullet shattered a driver's windshield
Thursday shortly after the bus left the Chattanooga, Tenn.,
terminal en route to Detroit, Greyhound spokeswoman Dana Neal said
Thursday night.
   None of the approximately 43 passengers was injured, Ms. Neal
said.
   The evening before, at least two shots struck a window on a bus
traveling in the same area outside Chattanooga, police said. No one
was injured, although the two passengers nearest the window got
off, police said.
   Authorities were investigating both incidents, but had no
evidence to link striking drivers to the shootings, police said.
   Earlier this week, eight passengers were injured when a sniper
fired on a bus traveling to Jacksonville, Fla.
   Also in Florida, St. Petersburg police said a striking bus
driver is being investigated in connection with an apparent attempt
to set an unoccupied bus on fire that was interrupted by a security
guard.
   Nelson declined to say if the union was planning a revised
proposal when talks resume.
   Currey said the company was returning to the bargaining table
only because federal mediators indicated it might help end the
strike. He would not say if the company has a new offer, but
repeated past statements that Greyhound can afford no more than the
$63 million, three-year contract it first suggested.
   Nelson said the union's concerns center on job security,
especially in the grievance procedures.
   ``We are close on pay, we are close on subcontracting (of
routes),'' Nelson said. ``We are concerned about ... deletion of
provisions that allow third-party independent mediation'' of
employee-management disputes,'' he said.
   Greyhound, the nation's only national intercity bus company, has
been operating at reduced levels since the strike began, using
permanent replacements and union members willing to cross the
picket line.
   Spokesman George Gravley said the company had carried more than
600,000 passengers since the strike began, including 44,364
Wednesday, 41.7 percent of the load carried on the same day last
year.
   Gravley said 37 percent of union-represented employees have
crossed the picket lines, most of them mechanics and office workers.
   The company says 394 union drivers are at work, joining 1,002
permanent replacements. The union says only 94 of its drivers have
crossed the line.

   Logging of virgin forests in the Pacific
Northwest will probably have to be reduced further to protect the
northern spotted owl, federal officials said Thursday.
   The conclusion was based a on preliminary version of a report
from scientists that was made public in an unusual meeting of the
federal government's top four land management officials.
   The chiefs of the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management,
Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service traveled to
Portland to address the issue, which pits environmentalists against
the region's vital logging industry.
   Lawsuits filed by environmental groups to protect spotted owl
habitat tied up logging of vast tracts of forest land until last
year, when Congress approved a compromise freeing timber sales on
much of the land. That agreement expires Sept. 30.
   The prime habitat for the spotted owl is the region's old growth
forests _ tracts of mature timber that never have been logged. The
old growth forests also account for most of the timber sold from
federal land.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service staff has recommended the owl be
listed as a threatened species, and final decision on the listing
is due by June 23.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, summarized some
of the implications of the draft report, produced by a committee
assigned to plan management of federal forest land to protect the
owl's habitat.
   ``I would say that based on what I heard this morning, the
Forest Service is going to have to provide some additional
protection over and above our existing spotted owl plan,''
Robertson said at a news conference. ``But how much, that's still
to be worked out.''
   He said that would mean a further reduction in national forest
timber sales _ the mechanism by which the government allows private
companies to log government land.
   Of the 1,500 pairs of owls known to exist in the forests of
Oregon, Washington and northern California, more than 90 percent
are on land managed by one of the four Interior Department agencies
represented at Thursday's meeting.
   There are about 7 million acres of suitable habitat for the owl,
and that would be reduced to 2.7 million acres by the year 2050 if
current timber-sales practices continue, according to a Fish and
Wildlife Service report.
   In addition to Robertson, officials at the meeting were Cy
Jamison, director of the Bureau of Land Management, John Turner,
director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Jim Ridenour,
head of the National Park Service.
   The four officials declined to discuss the specifics of the
scientists' report, which was being circulated for review by
officials throughout the affected agencies. It is to be made public
April 4 at a congressional hearing in Washington.
   If the owl were listed as a threatened species, the Forest
Service and Bureau of Land Management would be required to meet
specific requirements for protecting its habitat before approving
any timber sale. That could hamper efforts by the two agencies to
reach the target set in last year's compromise that 7.7 billion
board feet of timber be sold by Sept. 30.
   Jamison of the Bureau of Land Management said he agreed with
Robertson's conclusions about the need for further protection for
the owl.
   Robertson said the meeting was believed to be the first outside
Washington, D.C., to include the heads of all four agencies. He
said a series of such meetings was planned, and it was decided to
make the first one in Portland because the spotted owl is such a
pressing issue.
   About 150 people from a pro-logging organization outside the
hotel where the federal officials met, to press their case for
increased logging.
   ``We're all very concerned about the impacts our decisions are
going to have in the Pacific Northwest and in the communities
here,'' Robertson said.

hostages in Lebanon and for peace in the Middle East.
   ``Tonight we gather with our lighted candles and our paper
cranes and we pray ... that these would be the words that could

people who attended an interfaith service Thursday night in this
Buffalo suburb, marking the start of the 24-hour fast.

   Within hours of his inauguration to a strengthened
presidency, Mikhail S. Gorbachev persuaded his parliament to tone
down a resolution invalidating Lithuania's declaration of
independence.
   He followed up with a news conference _ only his second in
Moscow _ where he promised he would hold ``a respectful dialogue
with the people of Lithuania'' and their government. That is what
the Lithuanians are seeking, given the complexity of trying to
sever relations after 50 years as part of the Soviet Union.
   The resolution passed Thursday by the Congress of People's
Deputies stated clearly the Soviet intention of ignoring any
attempts by Lithuania to back its defiance with actions until the
conflict has been resolved. It said the Soviet Constitution and
laws remain in effect in the Baltic republic.
   But Gorbachev asked the deputies to drop the most
confrontational rhetoric and simply direct him to protect the
rights of Soviet citizens and the Soviet Union in the Baltic
republic, pending resolution of the conflict.

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres, after winning
a parliament victory to unseat Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, now
faces the difficult prospect of forging a new government to renew
the peace process.
   The parliament, or Knesset, on Thursday sided with Peres in a
60-55 vote of no confidence against Shamir, head of the right-wing
Likud bloc.
   The dispute between the two parties centered on the future of
the Middle East peace process. Shamir for weeks had balked at U.S.
proposals to get talks started with the Palestinians.
   In the end, a small but powerful religious party settled the
dispute by voting with Labor, which backs the U.S. peace effort.

   Removing the tropical rain forest from the
Amazon River basin of South America would change forever the
climate of that region and could affect the global weather, a new
study says.
   Once the trees are felled, said Jagadish Shukla, a professor of
meteorology at the University of Maryland, the famed dense jungle
forest along the Amazon River will be gone forever.
   ``You will never be able to regenerate the forests once you have
cut them,'' said Shukla, the co-author of a study appearing today
in the journal Science.
   Shukla said wiping out the Amazon River forest probably also
would affect the worldwide climate because it would change the
temperature of waters near the mouth of the river and perhaps
disrupt weather patterns affected by those waters.

   A ram's horn sounded and a cantor's
melancholy psalms went out from the mound where, 800 years ago
today, the Jews of York committed mass suicide to escape an
anti-Semitic mob.
   It is sometimes called ``The English Masada,'' this most
infamous incident of Jew-hatred in British history.
   Like the Jews who killed themselves on the desert fortress of
Masada rather than fall slaves to Rome, the memory of York Jewry's
fate has survived through the ages, still strong enough eight
centuries later to draw several hundred Jews and a handful of
Christians to a memorial service Thursday at the place where it
happened.
   The service opened a four-day program of lectures, concerts and
exhibitions organized by Jewish and Christian groups and the city
of York to commemorate the slaughter of March 16, 1190.

   Terry Anderson's daughter pleaded for the
father she loves but has never known to come home Friday, the day
Anderson began his sixth year as a hostage in Lebanon.
   The journalist's family, friends and colleagues somberly marked
the anniversary with commemorations and prayers in Washington, New
York, and Cyprus. Yellow ribbons fluttered from trees, signs and
poles in Anderson's hometown of Batavia, N.Y.
   Former hostages chained themselves to a tree in Paris to protest
Anderson's captivity, and President Bush pledged to work for the
hostages' release.
   But no message was as poignant as the one on television Friday
evening in Lebanon. In a videotape, Anderson's 4-year-old daughter
Sulome appeared, wearing a green coat and riding a bicycle given to
her at Christmas in Anderson's name.
   ``I got the bike for Christmas daddy. Thank you,'' said Sulome,
who was born 83 days after Anderson was seized by a pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem faction in Beirut.

   Britain said Friday its outrage at Iraq's hanging
of a London-based journalist was not diminished by news of his
robbery conviction, but some lawmakers said it raises questions
about his background and whether he was a spy.
   ``The questions of any incidents in the past are irrelevant to
the charges he faced in Iraq,'' said a Foreign Office spokesman.
``Our dismay at the execution has been made quite clear by the
government and remains unchanged.''
   Iraqi president Saddam Hussein ignored international appeals for
clemency and ordered 31-year-old Farzad Bazoft hanged Thursday for
spying for Britain and Israel.
   Britain recalled its ambassador to Iraq, ordered all six Iraqi
military trainees out of Britain, and canceled ministerial visits.
It did not break diplomatic relations or impose economic sanctions.

   No specific companies were targeted.
   ``Consumers who buy `environmentally friendly' products in hopes

   Friends, family and fellow journalists offered
prayers for Terry Anderson's freedom and rage that his captivity
had lasted five years Friday at a tearful, sunlit ceremony.
President Bush deplored the ``merciless imprisonment'' of U.S.
hostages but offered no hope for a speedy end to their ordeal.
   Bush promised Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who has devoted the
five years to bringing the journalist's captivity to the world's
attention, that he would ``take advantage of all legitimate
opportunities'' to free the captives.
   The president said he has a ``heavy heart'' when he thinks of
the hostages _ and said he thinks of them often.
   Anderson, 42, chief Mideast correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized on March 16, 1985, in Beirut, where he had been
reporting that city's chaos. His daughter was born shortly
thereafter, and he has never seen her.

   Temporarily at least, engineers got a wayward
private communications satellite out of harm's way and one
aerospace company Friday offered just-finished equipment for a
possible salvage mission by a space shuttle.
   With the new orbit, NASA might be more amenable to talking about
going after the Intelsat VI satellite. But, a spokesman said, the
space agency has not been asked to help in a rescue and would not
comment until it has.
   Intelsat, which owns the $150 million uninsured satellite, fired
small onboard thrusters to raise the satellite's orbit by nearly 60
miles. That put the 5-ton satellite out of immediate reach of the
atmosphere, which threatened to drag it back to Earth.
   ``This is very good news,'' said Tony Trujillo, spokesman for
Intelsat, a 118-nation consortium. ``We feel much better about the

   Topsy-turvy weather is sending wholesale
inflation on a roller-coaster ride so far this year, with prices
unchanged in February after a steep increase a month earlier.
   A sharp drop in energy prices offset increases for other items
and held the Labor Department's Producer Price Index steady overall
last month, the government said Friday.
   It was the best report in six months and welcome relief after
the huge 1.8 percent rise in January. That increase, the largest in
15 years, was driven by a record gain in energy costs and a large
jump in food prices.
   Food costs rose substantially again in February, particularly
vegetables.

   Twenty years have changed the Eden Hotel,
which called itself the ``oldest and favorite shop in town serving
the best Nepalese hash.'' Now it caters to clean-shaven trekkers.
   The ready availablility of hashish at the Eden and nearby
establishments, and the bearded, long-haired Westerners who bought
it, earned Jhochhen Road the nickname Freak Street.
   Although the hashish and flower children are gone a generation
later, along with the Eden posters saying ``Let us take you
higher,'' Jhochhen Road is still known as Freak Street.
   Nepal has outlawed the sale of drugs and the Eden now serves a
credible approximation of European cuisine to Western tourists who
happen by. About 150,000 visit Nepal each year.
   Hippies have given way to trippies, says the Insight Guide to
Nepal, and there is ``rarely a whiff of illicit smoke, and not a
bare breast to be seen in public.''
   Many trekkers prefer Thamel, a district for budget travelers
about a mile to the north, where such amenities as private baths
and hot water are easier to find than on Freak Street.
   Times have changed, but the old ones linger in many minds.
   Chaitanya Lal Srestha, a doctor who uses the initials W.F. (for
World Famous) before his name, remembers the visitors of the late
1960s and early 1970s.
   ``So many of them came to me for cures,'' he said in an
interview at his clinic, a tiny, ill-ventilated alcove lined with
herbs in glass bottles. ``I was famous on Freak Street because I
used the ayurvedic system of medicine, which does not have any side
effects, unlike the Western allopathic system.''
   ``The tourists had many problems,'' he said. ``They weren't very
clean, and their lives were odd. They often fell sick.''
   Few tourists visit Srestha now. He spends much of his time
visiting friends on Freak Street, a stooping man in his 50s who
shambles from restaurants to shops, reflecting with their owners on
more affluent days.
   Nhuchhe Narayan Manandhar, who owns a Freak Street hotel called
the Sayami Lodge, said, ``I remember the groups of tourists who
used to gather on the street and smoke chillums.''
   Chillums are clay pipes, usually filled with hashish or
marijuana.
   Manandhar, a dour-faced man of middle years, said he still was
wary of Western tourists.
   ``I don't give out my rooms to a single person,'' he said.
``Stay with someone and it's OK, less chances of trouble.''
   ``Some years ago, a German checked in alone and died because of
too many drugs,'' he said in a mixture of Nepali and English. ``We
didn't know until the next morning. I still think if there was
someone with him in the room, he could have been saved.''
   Rooms at the Sayami Lodge cost about $2 a night, making it among
the cheapest in the city. A few minutes from Manandhar's are sights
that include the old palace with its wooden lattice windows and
ornate carvings, and Durbar Square, in an area of at least 50 Hindu
temples.
   ``You can't see many freaks now,'' Manandhar said, waving toward
the narrow, cobbled street crowded with low-budget travel agencies,
restaurants, second-hand bookshops and stores selling
mountaineering equipment.
   Dipendra Purush Dhakal, Nepal's director of tourism, said
today's tourist spends more money and stays in Katmandu three days
during a trip to Nepal that averages 12 days.
   That means ``most visitors go to other places,'' he said. ``The
hippies didn't go anywhere outside Katmandu and didn't spend much
money.''
   Two reasons the hippies have disappeared are the 1972 ban on the
sale of narcotics and the requirement that a Western visitor who
stays in Nepal more than 30 days buy $10 worth of the local
currency for each of those days.
   Only two shops still have address boards proclaiming Freak
Street. The scores of others have reverted to the original
Jhochhen, which means a ``line of houses.''

<HEAD>Rich Indonesians Urged Not to Flaunt It</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Rudini, Sudomo and Suharto use only one name.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's leaders have admonished
rich Indonesians for years not to flaunt their wealth with luxury
homes or other conspicuous consumption.
   Now, President Suharto wants businessmen to help redistribute
wealth by selling shares in their companies to cooperatives.
   Home Minister Rudini declared in 1988: ``It is an insane idea
for people to compete to build mansions similar to the White House.
... They are asocial.''
   Retired Adm. Sudomo, coordinating minister for general policy
and security, said last year the slow spread of wealth was a
greater danger to stability than any political or military threat.
   Sudomo said ``the side effects of economic development'' were
not moving rapidly enough ``to cope with all the social problems so
we can narrow the gap between the rich and the poor.''
   Last month, Suharto said: ``Of course we cannot avoid
differences in levels of income and abilities, but these
differences should not be allowed to grow into a social gap that is
contrary to the spirit of togetherness.
   ``We must recognize these differences and take steps to minimize
them before it is too late.''
   Per capita annual income is less than $500 in this nation of 178
million people. The gap between rich and poor is great and a middle
class began to emerge only in the last generation.
   In his annual budget speech in January, Suharto urged companies
to sell 25 percent of their shares to cooperatives so the co-ops
could become a ``national economic force.'' He suggested making
loans to poorer cooperatives to help them buy the shares.
   Businessmen were surprised by the proposal and many dismissed it
as a populist response to criticism of powerful conglomerates.
   Indonesia has 34,000 cooperatives with about 26 million members.
They were established to give small farmers the advantages of mass
buying and marketing and to help introduce modern methods in
handicraft and cottage industries.
   Cooperatives, enshrined in the constitution, were intended as an
economic complement to state-owned enterprises and private
companies.
   Suharto has promoted cooperatives as the ideal way to help the
poor in a land where 70 percent of the people make their livings in
the countryside.
   Unfortunately, most cooperatives are perceived as poorly
managed, undercapitalized and burdened with bad debts. Of 6,000
rural credit co-ops, a 1988 World Bank report said, ``1,272 are
insolvent but not entirely hopeless, while 1,658 are candidates for
dissolution or liquidation.''
   Some businessmen, startled by the idea of selling shares to
cooperatives, hope Suharto's suggestion was a pep talk rather than
a new government policy of divestiture.
   As explained by Radius Prawiro, coordinating minister for
economy, finance and industry: ``This is an appeal and not an
entirely new policy. Helping one another must not be spelled out by
legislation. This is an appeal to the private sector to give
cooperatives a chance to own part of the equity.''
   Prawiro and other senior officials said private companies would
not be compelled to sell stock to cooperatives, but it was not made
clear how such transfers might occur without compulsion.
   Business analysts said few privately held companies would
voluntarily sell shares to cooperatives or lend money to finance
the purchases.
   Suharto's proposal followed months of statements by economists,
politicians and educators that efforts to deregulate the economy in
recent years benefited big enterprises at the expense of small
ones, especially of cooperatives.
   There were complaints that many of Indonesia's largest companies
are controlled by ethnic Chinese, who make up less than 5 percent
of the population but have great influence.
   Any belief that the Suharto proposal would fade away ended with
a major presidential gesture March 4. On that Sunday, he was host
on his farm at Tapos, 45 miles south of Jakarta, to 31 of
Indonesia's business leaders, most of them ethnic Chinese.
   ``A more equitable distribution of incomes should be developed,
together with growth and stability, otherwise social jealousy and
upheaval may break out to annihilate all our achievements,'' the
Jakarta Post quoted him as saying.
   He said conglomerates were useful in fighting tough
international competition, but should not become domestic
monopolies because ``they can also manipulate prices, causing the
people to suffer,'' the paper reported.
   Antara, the national news agency, quoted Suharto as saying that
``the government hopes the selling of shares to cooperatives will
proceed smoothly. ... If the transactions do not run smoothly, the
government will take measures to see to it that they do.''
   ``If this fails to proceed, the existing gap will only give rise
to social envy and social upheavals,'' Antara quoted him as saying.
``There will thus be no winners.''
   Suharto told the businessmen the government would prepare a list
of worthy cooperatives deemed to have the necessary financial
resources.
   ``That way,'' he said, ``you would not have to look for such
cooperatives.''

<HEAD>Michele Scarabelli Stars as `Normal' Space Alien</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michele Scarabelli says her role on Fox's
``Alien Nation'' as a melon-headed immigrant from the planet
Tencton is one of the most normal she's played on television.
   She stars as Susan Francisco, the mother of three and the first
Newcomer, as the aliens are called, to become pregnant. She had the
baby in February _ or rather, her husband, George, did.
   The way she became pregnant and the baby was born are among the
intriguing traits devised for the Newcomers in this series adapted
from the 1988 motion picture of the same name.
   ``I've never played a more normal role,'' said Scarabelli, who
was a homicidal psychopath on CBS's ``Dallas'' two years ago.
   ``Susan is very grounded, very real,'' she said. ``I think
that's because George is so quirky and compulsive. Susan is a
counterpart to that _ `Oh, George, calm down.' Susan was initially
created to be very much a woman of the '90s. The only outward
difference is the head.''
   The Franciscos, like all the Newcomers, look like a less pointy
version of the Coneheads on ``Saturday Night Live.'' They have no
hair or visible ears and their heads are covered with spots.
   Last November, Scarabelli's character became pregnant with the
help of two men, one of them her husband, in a ceremony both sexual
and religious.
   In February, she ejected a pod that George, played by Eric
Pierpoint, put into his marsupial pouch. In the second of a
two-part episode, he went into labor prematurely and his police
detective partner, played by Gary Graham, had to deliver the baby,
a daughter named Vessna.
   It's amazing that these ``normal'' Newcomer events happen during
television ratings' sweeps months.
   ``I had a prosthetic belly button and this tentacle came out of
it,'' Scarabelli said. ``Kids thought it was so gross, but they
loved it. People were taken aback by it and enthralled at the same
time.''
   Scarabelli was born in Canada and lived in Venezuela during part
of her childhood. At 12, she was taken to France to stay with
relatives. She began working as a model, but then studied at the
Montreal Actors Studio and moved to the Second City workshop in
Toronto.
   ``I played an Acadian woman in the first film I did,'' she said.
``We shot it in a small town in New Brunswick for Canadian
television. I loved it. It was called `Labour of Love.' It was my
first meaty part.''
   She starred in two feature films, ``Hotel New Hampshire'' and
``Cover Girl,'' and an NBC movie, ``The Ruling Passion.'' She also
had guest roles in HBO's ``Philip Marlowe'' and CBS's ``Night
Heat,'' and was a regular on USA Network's ``Airwolf II.''
   Scarabelli said the viewer reaction to ``Alien Nation'' has been
extraordinary. It's basically a detective show, yet it has an
underlying theme of tolerance for people who are different, such as
the Newcomers.
   ``We've gotten a lot of letters from teachers who say they use
it as a teaching tool,'' she said. ``The Jewish Board of Education,
which has jurisdiction over 400 schools in New York, uses it
because it addresses the issues of bigotry and prejudice. We've
also dealt with sexism.''
   In the movie, a spaceship carrying 270,000 slaves from Tencton
landed on Earth. Integrating them into society takes some doing.
They turn out to have all the moral values of human beings, as well
as the vices and failings. They also have some odd physiological
characteristics and strange cultural customs. These all figure
heavily in the stories.
   ``When we started, we were like a bunch of kids with a new
toy,'' Scarabelli said. ``We were fascinated with all the
possibilities. I brought a lot of things with me. I was raised in
Montreal, but I wasn't French Canadian or Catholic, so I could make
an identification with being different.''
   After filming the pilot last year, she flew to Anchorage,
Alaska, to help in the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez tanker spill.
   ``I was tired of watching the horror story on television,'' she
said. ``We drove from Anchorage to Seward and spent several weeks
there cleaning sea otters. They look like cartoon characters. We
weren't supposed to have eye contact so they wouldn't bond. It was
almost impossible not to look at them. We saved about 150, but I
don't know where they released them.''

<HEAD>Mexico Seeks Buyers for State-Owned Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're interested in buying a fish
processing plant, sugar refinery, telephone company or even a
former convent, Mexico is interested in you.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's government is trying to
sell hundreds of inefficient businesses and industries, many
nationalized more than 40 years ago, that have beome a crippling
drain on the budget.
   Motivations for taking over the companies were many: to free the
country from foreign exploitation, improve the lot of workers, save
jobs, avoid social unrest and bail out owners who had labor or
profit problems.
   After nationalization, the companies became sinkholes of
corruption and havens for political hacks from the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Two generations later, privatization has become part of a
strategy to reduce government subsidies, improve efficiency and
obtain new foreign investment and credit as Mexico tries to emerge
from seven years of economic crisis.
   ``What we have to do and what we are doing in Mexico is to
create attractive conditions for doing business in Mexico,'' said
Angel Gurria, assistant treasury secretary in charge of foreign
debt negotiations. He mentioned the sale of state-owned companies
as one of those conditions.
   A disadvantage is the loss of thousands of jobs through layoffs,
either by the government before the sale or the new owners
afterward.
   Heberto Castillo, a leader of the leftist opposition Democratic
Revolutionary Party, estimated 200,000 jobs were lost to
privatization and modernization in the past year.
   Mexico under Salinas has become, in the eyes of its creditors, a
model for debtor nations. It has opened the economy to foreign
investment and imports, brought down inflation and trimmed the
bureaucracy and budget.
   ``A state that is too busy administering its enterprises is
neither just nor revolutionary,'' Salinas said Nov. 1 in his first
state of the nation address.
   In January, he told residents of a poor suburb that some of the
money from sales of state companies would be used to bring them
services and that new owners of the companies would have to invest
in creating jobs.
   Not everything is being sold.
   Under the constitution, the government must own and control the
oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, which includes the oil
operations expropriated from foreign companies in 1938, basic
petrochemical production, electric power, nuclear energy and
radioactive minerals, satellite communications, railroads and mail
service.
   It has skirted the law by shifting many petrochemicals from
basic to secondary categories, thus permitting private and foreign
investment.
   Even historic mines and steel companies, some started by the
government, are included on the for-sale list. The Real del Monte y
Pachuca silver and gold mines, which the Aztecs worked before the
Spanish conquest, have been sold.
   Of the 1,155 companies the government owned seven years ago, 194
have been sold, 322 closed and 75 merged with others, according to
the Treasury Department.
   Among items awaiting buyers are 11 fish processing plants, seven
sugar refineries, two gas distributorships, the national telephone
company, a coconut plant and the former convent.
   The 1990 federal budget includes $14 billion in payments to
state-owned enterprises. That is up from $11.7 billion in 1989, but
it includes social security payments and airport funds.
   Luis Pazos, an economist who runs a private research center on
free enterprise, said figures on how many companies and government
operations have been sold or closed are unrealistic because ``many
only existed on paper.''
   He also questioned the government's commitment. If it really
wants to divest itself, the commercial banks, nationalized in 1982,
should be returned to private hands, and peasants who work
state-owned farms should be given title to the land, Pazos said.
   ``It's going very slowly, probably for political reasons,'' he
said. ``There is still fear of the left.''
   Some operations, including steel plants, are being held back
while generous union contracts are renegotiated and the facilities
are modernized.
   ``We have found that, without making certain changes, there
isn't anyone to buy them,'' said Alfredo Genel, director of
industries at the Commerce and Industrial Development Department.
   ``Over the years, not only union contracts, but relations with
suppliers, then with clients, became distorted,'' he said. ``They
aren't as rigorous in demanding the lowest price from suppliers.
They gave low prices or special terms to the clients. They don't
have a group of stockholders to answer to.''
   European countries found the steel industry could not be sold
unless it was modernized, he said.
   A privatization success story is the airline Aeromexico, which
was famous for delays and cancellations until it was sold late in
1988 to a private consortium and the pilots' union.
   Now it is known for on-time performance and better service.
Financial figures were not available.
   The government no longer is in the soft drink, textile, cement
and dish manufacturing businesses, among others.
   As for the convent of Santa Catarina in Oaxaca, southern Mexico,
it later was a jail and now is the Hotel Presidente.
   Several hotels are on the list of government offerings, but only
the operation of the Hotel Presidente will be sold because the
building is a national monument.

   A surprise nationwide sweep of fast-food
restaurants and other businesses found 7,000 teen-agers employed
for too many hours or in dangerous jobs in violation of child-labor
laws, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said.
   The three-day investigation, called ``Operation Child Watch,''
is expected to result in more than $1.8 million in civil fines
against businesses, she said Thursday. Fines totaling $2.7 million
were assessed during all of 1989.
   The majority of allegations involved firms in which 14- and
15-year-olds worked more hours or later at night during the school
week than allowed under federal law.

   Talks with the Japanese on a key trade dispute
involving purchases of American satellites broke off this week
after ``zero progress'' had been made, a U.S. trade official said.
   The official said Thursday that no further talks would be held
unless the Japanese alter their position.
   Satellites are one of three U.S. product groups that have been
targeted for the removal of trade barriers by the Japanese. If
significant progress has not been made by June 15, the
administration has the power to retaliate by imposing higher
tariffs on Japanese products.

<HEAD>Ohio Couple Settles Insider Trading Charges Involving Revco</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Cleveland investment bank employee
and her estranged husband have settled insider trading charges
involving the stock of Revco Drug Stores and two other companies.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement
in Washington on Thursday.
   Shirley Shiffman, formerly an administrative assistant with the
investment banking firm of Golenberg &amp; Co., was accused last July
of passing inside information to her husband, George, who allegedly
made $52,839 in illegal trading profits.
   The Shiffmans, of Aurora, Ohio, agreed to settle and consented
to a federal court order barring them from further alleged
violations of federal securities law.
   In addition, George Shiffman, was ordered to pay $105,678 in
fines and restitution, plus an additional $18,415 in interest.
   Ms. Shiffman was not required to pay any fines or penalties.
   ``There was no evidence that she personally profitted from the
trades,'' said James Kidney, an SEC attorney in Washington.
   Shiffman, who separated from his wife before the settlement was
reached, filed for bankruptcy court protection, the SEC said.
   Kidney said the SEC would pursue its claims against Shiffman in
bankruptcy procceedings, adding, ``We'll take whatever we can get.''
   Ms. Shiffman's attorney, Jonathan Eisenberg of Washington, who
said she would fight the charges when they were filed last July,
said she settled after authorities agreed not to seek any fines or
monetary penalties.
   ``It's much better to settle for nothing than to litigate,''
said Eisenberg.
   The SEC complaint charged that Ms. Shiffman, while working at
Golenberg &amp; Co., obtained confidential corporate information about
pending deals that included a management leveraged buyout of Revco
in 1986. The other alleged illegal trades involved the stock of
Magnetics International Inc. and Fisher Foods Inc.

<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines has added 100 daily flights,
including service to Panama, Costa Rica and several U.S. cities, in
its first schedule expansion in two years.
   The Houston-based subsidiary of Texas Air Corp. said Thursday it
will end its two-year ``no-growth mode'' by adding 23 planes to its
fleet and expanding its services to 1,417 daily flights.
   ``We needed to get our arms around our operational
difficulties,'' said Stan Hula, Continental vice president of
schedule development. ``We think we've got those problems licked.''
   Hula said Continental's financial condition has improved. The
airline reported a $3.1 million profit for 1989 despite a $56.1
million fourth-quarter loss.
   In addition, he said Department of Transportation statistics
reported customer complaints about Continental were down 96 percent
since 1987, and the carrier's on-time arrival performance was the
third-best among the nation's airlines in 1989.
   Beginning May 15, Continental will inaugurate Houston flights to
Panama City, Panama and San Jose, Costa Rica, giving Continental
the largest number of U.S. flights to Central America, he said. The
airline already has flights to Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala and
Honduras.
   ``We look to expand in Central America even further as time
passes,'' Hula said. ``The changing conditions in Panama obviously
make this service possible. The improving political climate has a
great deal to do with our interest in Central America.''
   In the United States, Continental is starting a late-night
operation out of Houston Intercontinental Airport with a dozen
flights leaving at 10:30 p.m.
   Elsewhere, new service is being added from Cleveland to
Louisville, Ky. and Norfolk, Va. From Newark, N.J., service is
being added to Greensboro, N.C., Norfolk, Va., Columbia, S.C. and
Antigua, West Indies. Those flights start May 1.
   Hula said the additional flights could prompt the airline to
hire nearly 1,000 new workers, including about 200 pilots and 600
flight attendants.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T, Unions Discuss Early Retirement Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T has presented one of its main unions
with a plan to sweeten pensions to encourage early retirements, the
company's latest move in a continuing effort to trim its workforce.
   The Communications Workers of America had a mixed reaction to
the proposal and offered a counter plan, said spokesman Steve
Rosenthal, but no details available. Talks were to resume Monday.
   AT&amp;T said it held talks Thursday with the CWA and its other main
union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, on
plans that for the first time would offer early retirement for
non-management employees.
   Last year, a special retirement plan for managers prompted
12,500 to depart out of 35,000 who were eligible, the company said.
   The arrangement added five years to each manager's age and
tenure, and boosted pension payments by 15 percent for five years,
or until a retired worker reached 65.
   The company had few details about the plan because talks were in
an early stage, said company spokesman Burke Stinson at AT&amp;T's
Basking Ridge office. Though AT&amp;T is headquartered in New York, the
bulk of its operations are in New Jersey.
   The efforts are ``another step in a continuing goal to reduce
overhead costs and consolidate operations,'' Stinson said.
   Though IBEW spokesman Tom Hickman said he could not comment on
the talks, he said the idea of offering enhanced pensions to induce
retirements ``is obviously something that we're not opposed to.''
   Probably less than 10,000 people would be affected, said Stuart
Crane, an analyst for Gruntal &amp; Co., though he noted it is
impossible to predict how many will accept the deal.
   ``I just think they're continuously putting the bait in front of
the donkey to get him to drive away,'' Crane said.
   Crane said it is likely AT&amp;T will continue to try to pare down
its workforce through the 1990s.
   According to AT&amp;T's Stinson, the company has steadily reduced
its workforce since 1984, when Bell Telephone broke up into
regional Baby Bell phone companies.
   As AT&amp;T computerizes its operations with new digital and solid
state technology, it has increasing numbers of workers with less to
do, Stinson said. More switching and operator services are done by
computer, and digital equipment has made equipment installation
easier.
   Also, competition has forced AT&amp;T to pare away extra layers of
employees that it could afford when it was a monopoly.
   At the time of the break-up, the company had 373,000 employees.
They now employ 281,400, 173,500 of whom are non-management.
   Last year a total of 25,000 jobs were cut, some through
attrition, Stinson said.

<HEAD>Automakers Offering Money if You Buy Competitor's Car</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   If a slew of incentives wasn't enough to fog a
car-buyer's mind, Nissan Motor Corp. is offering $100 to those who
test its Stanza sedan before buying a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.
   Chrysler Corp. recently ended a similar program urging potential
car-buyers to drive a Chrysler product and stack it up against the
competition. That program, which ran only last month, applied to
more cars than Nissan's does, but carried a reward of just $50.
   Ever since the mid-1970s, when the Federal Trade Commission
relaxed a ban on using a competitor's name in advertising,
companies have shown their products in action against the
competition.
   ``It's becoming more and more popular because of credibility.
Consumers see it and say `Well, if their saying it, it must be
true,''' Melvin Helitzer, a former advertising executive who is a
journalism professor at Ohio University in Athens, said Thursday.
   The Nissan and Chrysler promotions, designed to boost sales and
get people into showrooms, are the latest attempts by automakers to
persuade consumers to compare products, something smart shoppers do
naturally.
   ``Those really are (showroom) traffic builders,'' said Jim
Wangers, president of Automotive Marketing Consultants Inc. of
Vista, Calif. ``They say, `I've got enough confidence in my car and
I will put it on the line with anybody's.'
   ``But what it really says is, `Bring me more bodies.'''
   Chrysler and Nissan dealers could use more bodies in their
showrooms.
   During the first two months of the year, Chrysler's total
vehicle sales of 305,985 were down 1.4 percent compared with the
year-ago period, and Nissan's total vehicle sales were 89,974, off
16.3 percent.
   Nissan spokesman E.C. Mueller said the focus of the $100
test-drive offer is to get people into the Stanza, a newly
redesigned car.
   The offer works like this: A potential buyer test drives a
Stanza between Feb. 12 and April 30 and fills out an evaluation
form. The dealer reviews it, keeps one copy, sends another to
Nissan headquarters and gives one to the consumer.
   If the consumer takes delivery of an Accord or Camry within
seven days of the Stanza test drive and attaches the purchase order
to the copy of the Nissan evaluation, the consumer gets the $100 by
mail from Nissan in four to six weeks.
   If the consumer buys the Stanza, Mueller said, there's no reward.
   The results of Chrysler's $50 test-drive program are private
information, Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said.

<HEAD>Dispute Erupts in Cabinet Over U.S.-Japan Trade Measure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government dispute erupted Friday over
Washington's demand that Japan open its markets and prompted Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu to quickly intervene, officials said.
   The dispute, at a regular Cabinet meeting, was between the
ministers of trade and home affairs, over how to handle U.S.
demands to abolish a law restricting the opening of large retail
stores.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher was
ending trade talks in Tokyo after meeting with five major users of
semiconductors to encourage them to buy more from U.S. producers.
   Mosbacher came to Tokyo to follow up on the summit two weeks ago
between President George Bush and Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif.,
and address ways to reduce Japan's $49 billion dollar trade surplus
with the United States.
   One move requested by U.S. negotiators is to abolish Japan's law
protecting small businesses from being overwhelmed by supermarkets
or department stores moving into their neighborhoods.
   During Friday's Cabinet meeting, Home Affairs Minister Kaiwa
Okuda said Japan should eliminate the law entirely, said a Home
Affairs ministry official.
   Okuda criticized the minister of trade and industry, Kabun Muto,
because the trade ministry wants only to modify the law and make it
quicker for large retailers to get permits to open stores, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The home affairs minister said the trade minister's measure
would be insufficient to solve the dispute with Washington and
urged the trade ministry to come up with stronger measures that
would improve Japanese standards of living, the official said.
   Kaifu intervened before Muto was able to respond, the official
said, and the three met afterward. It was not immediately clear
whether the matter was resolved.
   The dispute at the usually mundane meeting was the top item on
noontime television news.
   Increasing the spread of large-scale retailers is thought to
raise the sales of imported goods, as small neighborhood stores are
less likely to stock foreign-made products.
   Mosbacher was to return to Washington later Friday. During his
four days in Tokyo, the commerce secretary met with Kaifu, Foreign
Minister Taro Nakayama, Trade Minister Muto and officials of the
country's top business group, the Federation of Economic
Organizations (Keidanren).
   On Thursday, Mosbacher urged Japan to move into a close
partnership with the United States to eliminate trade barriers.
   ``If we do not act soon, we may throw away our last chance to
save the world trading system from serious damage,'' Mosbacher told
reporters at the Japan National Press Club.

   The dollar was lower in European trading this
morning as the market waited for the release of a series of U.S.
economic indicators.
   Gold prices were slightly higher in thin trading, mainly
responding to the dollar's movements, dealers said.
   ``The dollar is pretty much at a standstill'' as investors
awaited figures of U.S. producer prices, housing starts and
industrial production, a Milan trader said.
   The American currency fell in New York trading Thursday after
statements from President Bush, who said he wanted U.S. interest
rates to fall.
   But market observers said investors may have been looking for a
reason to take some profits on recent dollar gains.
   Analysts in Milan said the U.S. figures probably won't provide a
definitive answer to the current debate over the direction of U.S.
interest rates between the White House and the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which favors keeping the rates steady.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.03 yen to a closing 152.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 152.23 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6980 West German marks, down from 1.7025;
1.5157 Swiss francs, down from 1.5222; 5.7375 French francs, down
from 5.7545; 1.9130 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9265; 1,253.63
Italian lire, down from 1,257.25; and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1778.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6233, compared with $1.6177 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $399.50 a troy ounce, up
from $398.50 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $399.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $399.25, up from $398.40 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.73 to close at a bid $399.68.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.11 a troy ounce, from
Thursday's $5.10.

   The dollar remained steady against the Japanese yen
today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 152.50 yen, up 0.03 yen from
Thursday's finish of 152.47 yen. After opening at 152.25 yen, the
U.S. currency ranged between 152.20 yen and 152.63 yen.
   An estimated $7.65 billion changed hands in spot trading, up
from the previous day's volume of $7.13 billion.
   ``The dollar edged up in afternoon after mixed trading in the
morning session, with the sense of disapointment'' among traders
after Thursday's denial by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno the
bank's official discount rate would be raised, said Chiyuki
Watanabe, a dealer with Sanwa Bank.
   Mieno, who returned from a nine-day European trip, during which
he attended a monthly meeting of the Bank for International
Settlements in Switzerland, told a news conference Thursday there
was no change in the central bank's stance of monitoring the
effects of its last rate hike.
   Market players have speculated for weeks the central bank would
raise its discount rate today by as much as 1 percentage point from
the current 4.25 percent, in effect since last December, to stem
the yen's downswing.
   The discount rate, the interest rate charged on loans by the
central bank to commercial banks, has a strong effect on other
interest rates. Higher interest rates tend to support a currency
but discourage stock traders.
   Kazuyuki Suzuki, an stock analyst with Daiwa Securities, said
the stock market was disappointed by inaction of the central bank
over its key lending rate.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
319.51 points Thursday, shed 55.20 points, or 0.17 percent, closing
the week at 32,616.44. The index gained 62.28 points at the end of
the morning session.
   ``The trading pattern remains almost unchanged this week, with
shares being bought first and then sold in the afternoon,'' Suzuki
said.
   An estimated 500 million shares on the first section changed
hands, up from 470 million shares traded Thursday.
   The Nikkei index lost a total of 1,640.99 points Monday through
Wednesday before Thursday's gain.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds closed
at 86.79 points, up from Thursday's close at 86.33. Their yields
fell to 7.180 percent from 7.275 percent the previous day.

<HEAD>SEC Alleges Young Investor Schemed to Avoid Losses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A recent Harvard University graduate who has
traded securities since the seventh grade was accused by federal
officials of misleading brokers so he would not lose money on deals.
   Andrew Worden, whose age was listed as 23 or 24, was described
Thursday as a self-employed investor in a Securities and Exchange
Commission civil lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
that charges him with securities law violations.
   Court papers said that despite his young age, Worden was an
experienced securities trader, having traded securities for his own
account as well as making investments for family members.
   Lawrence Iason, the SEC's regional administrator in New York,
said in court papers that the alleged scheme was ``abhorrent
because it tends to facilitate manipulation and excessive
speculation.''
   According to the lawsuit, Worden most recently worked out of his
Manhattan apartment, ordering securities for 41 different brokerage
accounts by creating corporate-sounding names to make his purchases.
   If the stocks went up in value, he would sell and make partial
or delayed payments on the order, the SEC charged. If the value
dropped, he would not pay at all and force the brokerage house to
take the loss.
   Worden allegedly misled brokers by creating names for his
accounts _ like Convergence Corp. and Worden Management _ and
giving false information about his finances.
   The lawsuit said the alleged scheme took place between August
1987, before his graduation from Harvard in 1988, to the present.
It said Worden avoided losses of $131,353 and profited by at least
$2,330.
   Worden's lawyer, Marc Powers, said Thursday evening he had just
received the lawsuit and would not comment.
   The SEC is seeking a court order freezing Worden's assets.

<HEAD>Federated, Allied to Reveal Employee Retention Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. are giving a U.S. Bankruptcy Court details of their
two-year, $25 million retention program designed to keep top
managers from joining competitors.
   David G. Heiman, a lawyer for the two Cincinnati-based
retailers, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. at a
hearing Thursday that the plan would be filed today with Aug's
court, where Federated and Allied filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization petitions two months ago.
   The companies, which have 260 stores and 100,000 employees in 28
states, listed a total of $7.7 billion in debts accumulated when
Toronto-based Campeau Corp. bought Allied in 1986 and Federated in
1988.
   In the Chapter 11 proceedings, Federated and Allied must get the
bankruptcy court's approval for spending proposals.
   Heiman also said he hopes the companies can file their
reorganization plans sometime this year, but said he could not be
more specific.
   Lewis Rosenbloom, a lawyer representing thousands of Federated's
unsecured creditors, said they have not been told when to expect
the reorganization plans, but would like to see them as soon as
possible to more effectively review proposed spending by Federated
and Allied.
   ``You're dealing with some of these things in a vacuum and out
of context,'' Rosenbloom said.
   Heiman said the manager retention plan will affect about 2,300
Federated and Allied employees nationwide, including senior
executives down through divisional merchandise managers, focusing
on a core of about 400 key executives. The plan will cost between
$10 million and $11 million each of its two years, with an
additional $5 million ``discretionary pool'' that management can
use to reward performance, Heiman said.
   He described the plan as a basic program to provide job security
assurances and performance bonuses. Aug will be asked to approve
the program at a hearing April 12, Heiman said.
   Rosenbloom said creditors support the retention program and
realize the need for it, but are concerned that it grants Federated
and Allied substantial discretion in operating the plan.
   Heiman also told the judge that preliminary indications show
Federated and Allied are enjoying better than expected sales this
month after sustaining a poor fourth quarter. Heiman declined to
give details of March sales.
   Aug on Thursday also gave Federated and Allied permission to pay
lawyers, accountants and investment bankers on the basis of
statements to be submitted monthly that will be shared with
creditors.
   The payments will be subject to stringent quarterly reviews,
Heiman said. He declined to say how much Federated and Allied have
budgeted for those expenses.
   Aug told lawyers in the courtroom, ``I am going to be reviewing
these fees in minute detail ... I'm looking for evidence of abuse.''
   Federated and Allied will ask Aug March 27 to approve spending
to continue five store remodeling or construction projects valued
at about $91 million. These involve projects at Bon Marche stores
in Seattle and Tukwila, Wash., and Eugene, Ore.; a Goldsmith's
store in Memphis, Tenn.; and a Bloomingdale's store in Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Slates Vote On Dual Trading Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange says it will seek
membership approval for dual-trading restrictions that would ban
the controversial practice in most of the Merc's financial futures
markets.
   The Merc said Thursday it had scheduled an April 17 referendum
in which owners of the exchange's approximately 2,700 seats will
vote on whether to ban dual trading in any contract month with
average daily volume of 10,000 contracts, with certain exceptions.
   If adopted, the proposal would require approval of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the federal regulator of the futures
markets, which is considering a complete ban on dual trading.
   Congress also is considering dual-trading restrictions that
would be potentially more severe than those proposed by the Merc,
although the congressional plans would allow dual trading in
markets with a proven ability to detect fraud.
   Dual trading is the widespread, legitimate practice among floor
brokers at futures exchanges of trading both for their own accounts
and their customers.
   Critics of the practice contend it allows brokers to defraud
their customers by positioning themselves to profit from large
customer orders they know will move a market, an illegal activity
known as front-running that prevents customers from getting the
best possible deal.
   Brokers are supposed to execute any customer orders before
trading for their own accounts.
   Front-running is one of many fraud schemes alleged by the
government in indictments against 48 people from the Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   The exchanges have generally defended dual trading, claiming it
improves the efficiency of their markets by effectively increasing
the pool of buyers and sellers. The more players in the market,
they say, the faster a customer order can be executed.
   The Merc proposal addresses this liquidity issue by restricting
dual trading on a contract-month basis instead of banning the
practice in an entire market.
   For example, in the Merc's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index
futures pit, contracts are currently traded for delivery in March,
June, September and December. Each contract represents the basket
of stocks tracked by the S&amp;P 500 index.
   Of the four contract months listed, only two _ March and June _
have average daily trading volume in excess of 10,000. Dual trading
would be banned in those markets but not in the September and
December contracts.
   The Merc proposal would label the high-volume contract months as
``mature liquid'' contracts. Most of the Merc's stock-index and
currency futures contracts would fall into that category but its
agricultural futures would not, said spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   In contrast, a bill passed last year by the House of
Representatives would ban dual trading in any futures market with
an annual daily volume of at least 7,000 trades for all contract
months combined. That restriction would apply to nearly all of the
markets at the Merc and the Board of Trade.

<HEAD>Retailer Hit With Another Complaint from Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Food and Commercial Workers Union has
filed another unfair labor practice complaint against Nordstrom
Inc., this one contending the company is withholding documents
essential to the bargaining process.
   Joe Peterson, UFCW Local 1001 president, said Thursday that the
company has refused to produce a number of important documents
dealing with employee schedules.
   The union contends the company recently allowed employees to
change their schedules so they, on company time, could organize and
attend an anti-union rally in Seattle.
   The company also is refusing to provide paperwork on back-pay
issues for which the union has already filed complaints, Peterson
said.
   Company spokeswoman Kellie Tormey told KIRO-TV Thursday that the
latest allegations are ``ludicrous'' and ``wishful thinking on the
part of the union.''
   The first contract talks since January between the union and the
company began Thursday afternoon and ended after three hours,
Peterson said Thursday night.
   ``We made no progress. Nordstrom seemed even more intransigent
than ever,'' he said, adding ``Nordstrom's main goal is to
eliminate the union.''
   Nordstrom spokesmen could not be reached for further comment
Thursday evening.
   The union has filed six complaints against Nordstrom with the
National Labor Relations Board, Peterson said.
   The board two weeks ago issued a complaint to the company for
allegedly bargaining directly with employees on the issue of back
wages, a process Peterson said is supposed to go through the union.
   And the state Department of Labor and Industries said in
mid-February that Nordstrom had violated state law by failing to
pay some employees for putting in time without compensation while
attending company meetings, writing customer thank-you notes and
making deliveries.
   The back pay could cost Nordstrom many millions of dollars,
especially if it's extended to include the company's 50,000 current
and former employees in Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia,
Utah and Alaska.
   The 2,000 sales, office and display workers in King and Pierce
counties who are members of the union have been working without a
contract since July 31, Peterson said.
   At issue are wages, benefits, grievance procedures, job security
and scheduling.
   ``We are as far apart today as we were the first day we started
talking last May,'' Peterson said.

<HEAD>Market Weakens for Soft White Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PENDLETON, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A glut of grain in India and Pakistan,
credit problems in Egypt and higher shipping costs are being blamed
for a suddenly-weak market for soft white wheat grown in the
Northwest.
   ``There's just not much grain moving here,'' Tom Winn, Oregon
Wheat Commission administrator said of the Port of Portland.
   Bids for soft white wheat have fallen more than $1 during the
past year, to $3.76 a bushel Thursday in Portland, Winn said.
   ``We're going nuts attempting to get a market turnaround,'' said
Wes Grilley of Pendleton, executive vice president of the
9,000-member Oregon Wheat Growers League.
   Oregon's soft white wheat is used in Asia for noodles, cookies
and baked products. In Egypt and other Middle Eastern nations, it
is used in unleavened bread and pita bread.
   Grilley said India and Pakistan had a bumper crop last year and
another is predicted this year.
   ``Egypt is desperate to get more wheat, but they need credit,''
he said.
   Grilley also blamed the cargo preference provisions of the Food
for Peace program, which require the bulk of federal aid exports to
be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels.
   ``Recently, on a sale to Egypt, the U.S. vessels were charging
$27 more per ton from the West Coast than from the East Coast and
the foreign flag vessels were charging $1 a ton more,'' Grilley
said.
   The Northwest, he said, was hit harder than other regions of the
country. Prices for Midwest dark northern spring wheat and hard red
wheat have fallen only about 75 cents during the past year, he said.
   ``It's obviously going to create some hardships,'' Grilley said.
``I think we are in for some strong belt tightening.''

<HEAD>Two Groups in Giant Fraud Case Divvying Up $753 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM KLAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington Public Power Supply System bondholders
could receive as much as 32 cents on the dollar under an agreement
between two groups sharing a $753 million settlement fund.
   For some bondholders, the payoff could be as little as 10 cents
for each of the $1 bonds.
   The payment agreement, announced Thursday, requires federal
court approval, said New York-based Chemical Bank, trustee of the
WPPSS bond fund. Payments would be made June 1, 1991.
   Sharing in the settlement would be holders of the defaulted
WPPSS bonds, which were sold to finance two since-abandoned nuclear
power plants, and members of a class-action lawsuit that alleged
fraud against the supply system, Northwest utilities and other
parties.
   Original investors who have held the bonds through most of this
decade will be able to collect as both bondholders and members of
the class-action suit.
   The $753 million fund was collected from settlements made
before, during and after the giant fraud case went to court before
U.S. District Judge William Browning in September 1988. Defendants
in the case included 88 Northwest utilities, the supply system,
bond underwriters, engineering firms and WPPSS advisers.
   The case was settled out of court after three months of trial.
The case consolidated dozens of lawsuits filed after WPPSS
defaulted on $2.25 billion in bonds sold to finance construction of
unfinished nuclear plants WPPSS Nos. 4 and 5. The default was the
biggest in the history of the municipal bond market.
   Jeffrey Klafter, attorney for the class-action plaintiffs, said
the recommended settlement would pay about 22 cents on the dollar
to those with a claim who had retained their bonds. The award would
be less for those who sold their bonds at reduced prices, he said.
   The bond fund, managed by Chemical Bank, will receive some of
the $753 million and also has received money from the sale of scrap
parts from the abandoned plants. The fund will total $210 million,
said Chemical Bank Vice President William Berls, enough to pay
bondholders only about 10 cents on the dollar. Thus some plaintiffs
would receive the 22 cents plus 10 cents per dollar invested.
   Those who purchased bonds after WPPSS missed its payments in
June 1983, leading to default the next month, would apparently
receive the least from the settlement fund. Those bonds have been
considered speculative, and many of the buyers paid original
purchasers as little as eight or nine cents on the dollar.
   Berls said all parties should be pleased with the agreement
``given the litigation risks, given the time we have saved everyone
... and the uncertainties of appeals.''
   The two sides also agreed to repay the bond fund $52 million for
previous litigation expenses. In addition, $50 million and $43.5
million in interest will be transferred from the settlement fund to
the bond fund on June 1, 1991.
   Also expected to come out of the settlement fund is nearly $100
million that has been requested by lawyers for the class-action
plaintiffs. Browning has yet to decide on the eventual payoff for
lawyers.
   Another lawsuit still before Browning could result in $400
million in payoffs for bondholders. That suit, against WPPSS and
the Bonneville Power Administration, alleges expenses for two other
supply system plants were unfairly billed to plants Nos. 4 and 5.

   Suddenly it seems that proxy battles are in,
with corporate predators making them the latest trend in takeovers.
   But while directors of several big companies have become
targeted for removal by dissident investors, it remains to be seen
how successful these ploys are.
   The boards of Lockheed Corp. and Avon Products Inc. face proxy
fights by corporate suitors at their upcoming annual meetings.
   Meanwhile, USX Corp. has averted a threatened proxy battle with
Carl Icahn by agreeing to put his proposal for selling the
company's steel business to a shareholder vote.
   Proxy fights _ essentially a contested shareholder election for
control of management _ have regained some of their luster as other
takeover methods such as junk bond-financed hostile buyouts have
lost theirs.
   High-risk junk bonds were raiders' tool of choice during the
hostile takeover binge of the 1980s. But with the collapse of
several junk-financed companies and the bonds' main purveyor,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., some would-be acquirers think it's
easier to seize control through proxy battles.
   Investor Harold Simmons plans a proxy fight at Lockheed's March
29 annual meeting because he's unhappy with the current board's
management of the defense and aerospace company. He thinks he can
do a better job of deploying its assets and cutting costs _ thereby
increasing the value of his Lockheed stock.
   Simmons, who is Lockheed's biggest shareholder with 19 percent
of its stock, has nominated a slate of directors that includes such
high-powered names as former Texas Sen. John Tower and retired
Admiral Elmo Zumwalt Jr., a former member of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
   At a news conference this week, Simmons was undaunted when a
reporter noted that proxy fights _ notably Icahn's unsuccessful
1988 attack on the board of Texaco Inc. _ generally have had little
success.
   Simmons said of Icahn, who is chairman of Trans World Airlines,
``He's not basically a manager.'' Simmons and Icahn both are viewed
as corporate raiders, but Simmons believes he has a better track
record after running companies like NL Industries Inc., Amalgamated
Sugar Co., and Keystone Steel and Wire Co.
   Simmons thinks that should carry some weight with Lockheed
shareholders. He also believes his chances for success are better
than Icahn's were at Texaco because Lockheed is in worse financial
shape than the oil giant was two years ago and probably has more
unhappy shareholders.
   Icahn, then Texaco's biggest shareholder, tried to unseat the
Texaco board because he thought the company wasn't doing enough to
increase its stock price. If he had won control, he planned to sell
some of its assets and distribute the proceeds to Texaco
shareholders.
   Texaco won the proxy battle when shareholders voted against
Icahn's slate of nominees. But it also undertook a restructuring
that included billions of dollars in asset sales and a special
dividend to shareholders.
   Icahn was considering a proxy fight at USX, where he also is the
largest stockholder. However, he sidestepped that tactic in
exchange for a shareholder vote May 7 on splitting up the oil,
steel and gas company, which he says would increase shareholder
value.
   Other companies have thwarted proxy fights long before their
annual meetings are held.
   A year ago, Polaroid Corp. stopped a proxy attack by Shamrock
Holdings Inc. by putting enough of its shares in friendly hands to
defeat a Shamrock slate of nominees. Shamrock gave up after the
courts in Delaware, where Polaroid is incorporated, upheld the
defensive move.
   Some other companies have averted proxy fights only by
capitulating to dissidents' demands.
   Allegis Corp. abandoned plans to become a travel empire after
Coniston Partners, which held a 13 percent stake in the company,
and the pilots of Allegis' United Airlines unit began soliciting
votes to unseat management in 1987.
   Coniston and the pilots wanted to replace the Allegis board with
directors who would sell the company's non-United assets, including
Westin Hotels and Hertz car rental. The board ended up doing that
anyway, fired Chairman Richard Ferris and changed the company's
name to UAL Corp.
   Coniston later dropped its proxy campaign.
   Sometimes proxy battles that go to a vote do succeed. On
Thursday, the board of Xtra Corp., a Boston-based trailer leasing
concern, said it had lost a proxy fight to a slate of dissidents
who opposed management's plans to sell the company.
   Chartwell Associates L.P., which includes the owners of Mary Kay
Cosmetics and a Getty family trust, plans a proxy battle for four
seats on the 11-member board of Avon Products.
   The group, which owns nearly 10 percent of stock in the cosmetic
company, said it wants to maximize shareholder value by selling
Avon, which is best known for its core direct-sales business.

   Industrial production, pulled down in January
by a cutback in automobile output and utility use, bounced back 0.6
percent in February with the return of autoworkers, the government
said today.
   The Federal Reserve said February's advance followed a revised
1.0 percent drop in January's output and a 0.1 percent gain in
December. January's output originally was reported to have fallen
1.2 percent.
   In a second report, the Fed said the operating rate of the
nation's factories, mines and utilities _ which usually moves in
tandem with industrial production _ rose 0.3 percentage point to
82.3 percent in February. The operating rate measures not only
output but also changes in productivity levels.
   ``The output of motor vehicles and parts increased sharply in
February following the substantial cut in January, although the
level of motor vehicle production in February was still more than 5
percent below its December level,'' the Fed said in its industrial
production report.
   ``Excluding motor vehicles and related industries, production
was little changed,'' it added.
   Thousands of autoworkers returned to production lines in
February after being laid off the previous month as the industry
reduced bloated inventories.
   Industrial production at manufacturing plants making both
durable and non-durable goods rose 0.7 percent in February after
falling 0.7 percent a month earlier.
   Durable manufacturing was up 1.4 percent after a 1.5 decline in
January. Non-durable manufacturing slipped 0.2 percent compared to
a 0.4 percent gain the previous month.
   Output at mines dipped 0.5 percent from a 2.5 percent advance
while utility output was off 0.8 percent after a 10.6 percent drop
in January.
   The Fed said its industrial production index in February stood
at 141.8 percent of its 1977 base, up from 141.0 percent in January.
   The Fed also said the increase in capacity utilization
``resulted almost exclusively from an increase in the operating
rate for auto and truck assembly facilities after most had been
shut down for part of January.
   ``Utilization rates in most other manufacturing industries, as
well as mining and utilities, declined in February,'' it said.
   The manufacturing plant operating rate rose to 82.4 percent from
82.0 percent in January.
   The rate at factories producing durable goods _ big-ticket items
expected to last more than three years _ was up to 80.5 percent
from 79.6 percent the previous month. The rate at factories
producing non-durable goods was down from 85.5 percent in January
to 85.0 percent last month.
   The operating rate at mines slipped to 84.4 percent from 84.8
percent in January, while it fell 0.7 percentage point to 77.3
percent at utilities.

   The stock market staged a broad advance today in
an upbeat ``triple witching hour'' on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 12.61 to 2,708.33
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 658 up, 305
down and 434 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 59.61 million shares as of 10
a.m. EST.
   Blue chip stocks attracted buy orders at the witching hour,
marking the last trading in a set of options and futures on stock
indexes used by professionals in computerized index arbitrage.
   The market's response was less clear, however, to word that the
producer price of finished goods was unchanged in February after
climbing 1.8 percent the month before.
   The apparent dropoff in inflationary pressures, which had been
widely forecast, was attributed primarily to a decline in energy
prices.
   Brokers said the data, excluding often-volatile food and energy
prices, still suggested a worrisome degree of underlying inflation.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up { at 47&rsqb;; Philip
Morris, up { at 38{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up | at 41},
and International Business Machines, up } at 107}.
   Apple Computer jumped 3{ to 40\ as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. Late Thursday the company said its sales
and earnings for the quarter that ends March 30 will be stronger
than expected.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.92 to 187.12. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.15 at 363.42.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.88 to
2,695.72.
   Advancing issues held a narrow edge on declines at the NYSE.
   Big Board volume totaled 144.41 million shares, against 145.06
million in the previous session.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two House members called today for mandatory
jail terms and fines of up to $100,000 for employers who repeatedly
violate child labor laws.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said child labor laws need to be
overhauled to make effective the Labor Department's efforts to
crack down on businesses that violate them.
   Schumer, speaking before a House Government Operations
subcommittee on employment and housikng, called for increasing the
civil penalties for child labor violations from $1,000 to $10,000.
   Schumer said that between 1987 and 1989 there were 128,000
minors who were injured and an estimated 59 killed in the
workplace. Yet 37 employers who were cited for violations relating
to those cases were fined a total of only $27,000, he said.
   ``The average penalty was a paltry $740 _ $740 for a child's
life in the United States,'' Schumer said.
   The hearing came a day after Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
announced that a three-day sting operation had uncovered 7,000
minors employed in dangerous jobs or working long hours in
violation of child labor laws. The companies are expected to face
civil fines totaling $1.8 million, she said.
   Rep. Don Pease, D-Ohio, said, ``A three-day undercover sting
followed by a highly publicized media blitz is no substitute for
practical laws and sustained enforcement over time,'' Pease said.
   Schumer and Pease plan to introduce legislation next month to
expand the definition of child labor violations.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the committee chairman, said the
panel would explore why child labor violations have increased and
whether it is due to labor shortages or increased economic
pressures on families.
   ``The sad fact is that it may continue to make economic sense to
employers to violate the law'' if penalties remain at present
levels, Schumer said.
   Lantos said more enforcement personnel are needed, ``not for
three days, but every single day of the year so the most valuable
resource of this nation _ children _ will not be frittered away in
terms of their time, energy and physical well-being.''
   At a news conference Thursday, Mrs. Dole said proposed revisions
to the nation's child labor laws were under review.
   She said the government should first make the most of current
resources. ``Then if additional funds are needed, you can bet I'll
ask for those funds,'' she said.
   Most of the violations uncovered this week involved firms in
which 14- and 15-year-olds worked more hours or later at night
during the school week than allowed under federal law, said William
Brooks, an assistant labor secretary.
   But there also were more than 900 youngsters, mostly 16- and
17-year-olds, who were performing dangerous tasks or using
hazardous equipment such as power-driven meat-slicing machinery,

   Federal law forbids 14- and 15-year-olds from working more than
three hours on a school day or 18 hours during a week when school

   The stock market gained ground today in an
upbeat ``triple witching hour'' on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 20.27 to 2,715.99
by 11 a.m. EST.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 759 up, 428 down and
499 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 90.76 million shares at
midmorning.
   Blue chip stocks attracted buy orders at the witching hour,
marking the last trading in a set of options and futures on stock
indexes used by professionals in computerized index arbitrage.
   The market's response was less clear, however, to word that the
producer price of finished goods was unchanged in February after
climbing 1.8 percent the month before.
   The apparent dropoff in inflationary pressures, which had been
widely forecast, was attributed primarily to a decline in energy
prices.
   Brokers said the data, excluding often-volatile food and energy
prices, still suggested a worrisome degree of underlying inflation.
   Norton Co., subject of a $75-a-share bid by BTR PLC, shot up 15}
to 74.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up { at 47&rsqb;; Philip
Morris, up } at 38}; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up { at 41|,
and International Business Machines, up ~ at 107~.
   Apple Computer jumped 3 to 39} as one of the most active issues
in the over-the-counter market. Late Thursday the company said its
sales and earnings for the quarter that ends March 30 will be
stronger than expected.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.09 to 187.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.34 at 363.61.

<HEAD>NBC Sues Sony, Columbia Over Home Video Venture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC Inc. has filed a $250 million lawsuit
against Sony Corp. and Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.,
alleging they secretly diverted home video distribution business to
Sony.
   The lawsuit filed Thursday in Superior Court concerns
RCA-Columbia Home Video, jointly owned by NBC and Sony-Columbia. It
is among the nation's leading home video distributors.
   The suit charges Sony, Columbia and various subsidiaries
practiced ``self-dealing designed to appropriate the assets,
business opportunities and profits of RCA-Columbia Home Video for
their own companies.''
   A Sony spokesman declined to comment, saying the company had not
received a copy of the lawsuit. But the company issued a statement
saying, ``the lawsuit is surprising because Columbia and NBC have
enjoyed a good relationship.''
   In a recent deal, Sony-Columbia acquired theatrical distribution
and home video distribution rights for a major package of future
films by Orion Pictures.
   NBC's complaint alleges that Orion first offered distribution
rights to RCA-Columbia, but that Sony-Columbia refused to let the
joint venture proceed. It also says Sony-Columbia never told
RCA-Columbia it was secretly negotiating its own deal.
   Harry Rubin, NBC vice president for home video, said Sony and
Columbia ``have intentionally diverted business to themselves that
should have should have gone to the joint venture.
   ``This goes beyond a normal business dispute and is not the type
of behavior we are accustomed to from business partners,'' he said
in a statement.
   The complaint also alleges Sony and Columbia have used
confidential information on the joint venture's distribution goals
to Sony's benefit.
   ``It is our contention that Sony's executive in charge of
strategic planning in Japan directly contacted the various
Sony-Columbia representatives and required that type of information
be shared with them,'' NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge said in a
telephone interview from New York.
   Rutledge said RCA-Columbia, in which NBC has a half-interest,
had been averaging annual profits of more than $70 million and was
itself valued at more than $1 billion before Sony acquired Columbia
in October 1989.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Mostly Lower On Lack Soviet Sales</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed, then
turned mostly lower today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
disappointment over the lack of anticipated sales of corn and
soybean meal to the Soviet Union.
   Wheat futures showed some strength, though, after the
Agriculture Department announced it had accepted bids from
exporters to sell 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat to China at
subsidized prices.
   Many analysts had expected a higher opening in the soybean
market following Thursday's gains of as much as 13{ cents a bushel
on rumors that the Soviets were in the market for corn and, by
logical extension, soybean meal as livestock feed.
   But, ``there was no evidence this morning that the Russians
bought more corn,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain market analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The soybean market showed little reaction to news that Brazilian
President Fernando Collor de Mello had ordered a halt to
agricultural subsidies. Brazil is the world's second-largest
soybean producer.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.85\ a bushel; corn
was { cent to } cent lower with March at $2.46{ a bushel; oats were
{ cent to 1\ cents higher with March at $1.45 a bushel; soybeans
were { cent to 3{ cents lower with March at $5.82 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .08 cent to .22 cent higher with April
at 77.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .28
cent higher with March at 82.77 cents a pound; live hogs were .02
cent lower to .50 cent higher with April at 53.20 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .12 cent lower to .45 cent higher with
March at 50 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures retreated on Thursday while pork futures were
mixed.

   The effect of milder-than-usual weather on
energy supplies held wholesale prices steady in February, the
government said today.
   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index showed no change
following a huge 1.8 percent jump in January.
   A holiday cold snap had caused record increases in energy prices
and large food price rises, propelling the overall index in January
to the largest increase in 15 years. The February report, despite
another substantial rise in food costs, was the best in six months.
   Figures for the two months, taken together, represent an
annualized wholesale inflation rate of 11.4 percent. However,
economists do not expect anything approaching that for the entire
year.
   Most anticipate prices will rise between 4 percent and 4.5
percent in 1990, slightly lower than the 1989 rate of 4.8 percent.
   The February price report was in line with economists'
predictions and traders said it had little effect on stock and bond
prices. However, a Federal Reserve report showing
less-than-expected strength in manufacturing helped send financial
markets higher in early trading.
   Economic weakness is seen as giving the Fed room to lower
interest rates, a boon to stock and bond prices.
   Industrial production rose 0.6 percent in February after falling
1 percent in January, the central bank said. The bounce-back was
weaker than anticipated.
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said the seasonally adjusted
rate of new construction of homes and apartments fell 7 percent
last month after a huge 24.7 percent rise in January.
   Stock markets were also heavily influenced by computerized
trading, driven by the ``triple witching hour'' expiration of a set
of options and futures contracts on stock indexes.
   In the first half hour of trading, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks rose 12.61 to 2,708.33.
   Energy prices in February plunged 5 percent after soaring 13.6
percent in January.
   The effect of the weather showed up most strongly in fuel oil
prices, which rocketed 25.3 percent in January and plummeted 30.2
percent in February. They were the biggest increase and decrease
since the department began tracking that price in 1973.
   Gasoline prices fell 2.3 percent last month after rising 16.7
percent in January. Natural gas prices edged up 0.1 percent after
jumping 3.2 percent in the previous month.
   Food prices in February rose 0.9 percent, compared with January
when they rose 2.1 percent, the biggest jump in six years.
   Vegetable prices last month shot up 23.3 percent, on top of the
58 percent rise in January. The holiday freeze killed vegetable
crops from Texas to Florida. However, analysts expect vegetable
costs to subside this spring as new crops are harvested.
   In other good news for grocery buyers, the wholesale price of
eggs plunged 24 percent while dairy costs fell 2.7 percent. Both of
those categories had been increasing for most of the previous year.
   However, chicken prices shot up 8.5 percent and fruit rose 8
percent.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a
moderate 0.4 percent in February after a slight 0.1 percent rise in
January. Economists often use this so-called core rate as a better
indication of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.
   ``Inflation has been capped but it hasn't been broken,'' said
economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co.
   Weakness in manufacturing is preventing inflation from
accelerating, he said, but the sluggishness hasn't spread to other
sectors enough to substantially reduce inflation.
   In other categories, prices rose 1.1 percent for children's
clothing, held steady for passenger cars, jumped 2.9 percent for
tobacco products and plunged 5 percent for home electronic
equipment.
   The various changes put the index for finished goods at 117.4 in
February. This meant that a hypothetical selection of goods which
cost $100 in 1982, cost $117.40 last month, up from $111.70 a year
earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also
eased in February. Intermediate goods fell 0.7 percent, following a
1.2 percent rise in January, while crude goods increased a moderate
0.4 percent following a 2.4 percent jump a month earlier.
   An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<TEXT>
   President Fernando Collor de Mello today
announced sweeping economic reforms including a 30-day price freeze
and a new currency to slash 2,700 percent annual inflation and a
$31 billion budget deficit.
   The austerity measures were announced one day after Collor de
Mello was inaugurated as Brazil's first popularly elected president
in 29 years.
   ``The measures are profound, courageous and indispensable.
Society needs less state and more economy,'' he said.
   Brazil has the Western world's eighth-largest economy and
third-biggest trade surplus, and is a producer and exporter of
sophisticated goods such as computers, cars, aircraft and rockets.
   But it also has Third World's largest foreign debt, put at $114
billion; soaring inflation, 7 million street children, high adult
illiteracy, sprawling shantytowns, epidemics of dengue, malaria and
yellow fever.
   Collor de Mello said his free-market economic reforms would move
toward correcting Brazil's social and economic imbalances. The
measures introduced today included a crackdown on official
corruption and white-collar crime.
   The reform package takes effect immediately but must be approved
by Congress within 30 days. If Congress fails to vote, Collor de
Mello can reissue the measures for another 30 days.
   Collor de Mello said once the price freeze ends in mid-April, a
government index will determine monthly wage and price increases.
Globo, Brazil's largest commercial television network, said
salaries and prices would jump 40 percent in April and 20 percent
in May.
   In March, salaries will increase by February's inflation rate,
or 73 percent. Inflation this month was expected to reach 85
percent.
   Collor de Mello also said the cruzado novo currency would be
replaced by the ``cruzeiro.'' The nation's fourth currency in as
many years will be devalued by about 100 percent versus the cruzado
novo, economists said.
   The ``cruzeiro,'' was the name of a currency suspended in 1986.
   Collor de Mello decreed a new law to punish crimes against the
economy, including speculation and illegal price increases. The law
imposes a five-year prison term for violators. White-collar crime
by public employees would also result in firings and jail time,
Collor de Mello said.
   ``Who tries to cheat and fool the people will be jailed,''
Collor de Mello said.
   The new measures included:
   _Steep new income taxes for citizens and corporations.
   _The suspension of an estimated $2.2 billion spent annually in
government subsidies to private enterprise. Export companies were
the principal beneficiaries.
   _Privatization of some of Brazil's 188 state-owned companies,
many of which operate at a loss. They have total debts of around
$62 billion.
   _Stiff increases in public utility rates.
   _An administrative reform that includes mass dismissal of public
employees. The federal government has about 700,000 workers, and
aides to Collor de Mello have talked of firing about 80,000.
   _The disbanding of some government enterprises, including the
Institute of Sugar and Alcohol, the Brazilian Coffee Institute, the
steel holding company Siderbras, the port authority Portobras, and
Interbras, the foreign trade subsidiary of the oil monpoly
Petrobras.
   Collor de Mello said he was serious about slashing federal
spending.
   ``This year's federal deficit will be zero. ... There's no way
to knock down inflation if the government spends more than it takes
in,'' he said.
   Collor de Mello also said he would slash import barriers and
encourage foreign capital.
   ``We will modernize our economy and stimulate competition ...
Free initiative is the only way to sustained and progressive
growth'' he said.
   Collor de Mello issued decrees Thursday cutting the number of
government ministries from 25 to 12, putting up for sale
government-owned mansions and cars, and preventing public employees
from holding more than one public job.
   Initial reaction from conservative politicians and the business
community to Collor de Mello's economic measures was positive.
   ``We've worked all our lives for reforms like a balanced budget.
Halelujah!,'' said conservative Sen. Jarbas Pasarinho of the Social
Democracy Party.
   Albano Franco, president of the National Confederation of
Industry, said: ``The package will allow Brazil to escape this
terrible economic crisis.''
   But labor unions have made clear their displeasure.
   ``Once again, the workers will be sacrificed,'' said Jair
Meneguelli, president of the leftist Central Workers Union, a labor
umbrella group representing 12 million workers.
   Collor de Mello ended the five-year term of President Jose
Sarney, who took office after an Electoral College vote set up by
the military regime that ruled Brazil between 1964 and 1985.

<TEXT>
   General Development Corp. has agreed to plead
guilty to federal charges in connection with an alleged scheme to
inflate the cost of homes at the firm's nine Florida developments,
federal officials said today.
   The plea was announced along with the unsealing of a 16-count
indictment against General Development and two former executives.
The indictment was issued Tuesday but not made public while
officials discussed possible plea agreements with the defendants.
   The Miami-based real estate development firm agreed to plead
guilty to one count of ``conspiring through certain of its officers
to violate the federal mail fraud statute.''
   General Development agreed to pay a fine of not more than
$500,000 and agreed in principle to enter into a civil consent
decree establishing a restitution fund for eligible homebuyers who
purchased homes between Jan. 1, 1982 and Dec. 31, 1989.
   Charles J. Simons, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said he was ``gratified that General Development has been
able to put this episode in its history behind it.''
   ``This company will be run in full compliance with all laws and
regulations and with the highest standards of business ethics,''
said Simons. ``It is clear that our house prices had gotten out of
line with our competition and that some of our customers were
disadvantaged.''
   The indictment alleged that General Development sold more than
10,000 homes between 1983 and 1989 at prices exceeding fair market
value. In at least one case, the home was valued at less than half
its sale price.
   Also named in the indictment was GDV Financial Corp., a General
Development subsidiary that provided mortgages and other financial
assistance to home buyers.
   Former General Development Chairman David Brown and former
President Robert Ehrling were accused of fraud in the indicatment
and were also considering plea agreements, U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen said.
   There was no immediate comment from either man, and General
Development said it did not have telephone numbers where they could
be reached. Brown and Ehrling were ousted from General Development
a week ago.
   Lehtinen said a plea agreement for the two executives could
include jail time.
   Lehtinen said details of the planned restitution by General
Development were still under discussion and would not be official
until he files a civil consent order.
   Under the agreement, which still must be approved by financial
institutions holding mortgages on General Development homes, up to
$100 million could be set aside for reimbursement.
   Lehtinen said federal officials hoped General Development would
remain in business, but the plea agreement could require dismissal
of other top executives.
   General Development is fighting to survive a cash shortage that
the company says results from its legal problems. Lenders and
investors have deserted General Development since it disclosed that
it might be indicted by a federal grand jury investigating how
General Development markets its homes.

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slightly more than 4,000 U S West Inc.
managers and administrators have accepted the company's latest
voluntary retirement program, a U S West spokesman said.
   Dick MacKnight said Thursday 4,022 people chose from a variety
of retirement plans and left the payroll last month.
   Last year, the Denver-based company, parent of U S West
Communications in Omaha, offered 6,300 managers incentives to take
early retirement.
   U S West said the proposals were aimed at reducing costs and
focusing attention on customer services.
   Of the total, 2,881 took pension benefits in a lump sum,
MacKnight said. The remainder chose monthly pensions.
   Despite the employee cutbacks, which have occurred at U S West
since 1982, the company's work force stood at 70,587 at the end of
last year, only 178 fewer than employed by the company in 1984.
   MacKnight said U S West had added employees through creation of
new companies and acquiring others.
   ``What's happened is that the telephone companies have continued
to downsize and others outside the telephone companies have
continued to grow,'' he said.
   In a report to stockholders, Jack A. MacAllister, chairman and
chief executive officer, said that U S West planned to increase its
annual investment in the telephone business to $2 billion a year,
or by 15 percent, beginning in 1990.

<TEXT>
   Eddie Antar, the eccentric founder of the
Crazy Eddie Inc. stereo chain, once suddenly changed his mind about
going to dinner with a group of associates and jumped into a long
black limousine in front of the restaurant.
   After dinner, the associates saw the limo still there and asked
the driver what had happened to Mr. Antar, as the story is told by
a businessman who had dealings with Antar.
   The driver was confused, and then understood.
   ``He said, `That crazy guy? He walked in one door and out the
other,''' said the businessman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Antar has become even more elusive. In fact, he is a fugitive
from a federal judge's contempt citation in a Securities and
Exchange Commission insider trading case against him.
   Antar failed to appear today to give sworn testimony in the
case, paving the way for him to be found in default and have a
judgment entered against him.
   And in court papers filed late Thursday, his attorneys said they
wanted to withdraw from the case ``based on Antar's
unavailability.''
   The Brooklyn, N.Y.-born high school dropout built an empire of
43 stores in four states from a lone outlet. Much of his success
was to two decades of TV-rattling commercials advertising
``INSANNNNNE'' prices.
   ``His commercials used to annoy me, and now he's annoying me,''
said U.S. Marshal Arthur Borinsky, the man in charge of tracking
Antar down.
   ``I have no expectations at all about seeing him,'' said a
source close to Antar.
   Antar disappeared after U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan
found him in contempt for failing to appear in court to Feb. 28.
   Earlier, Politan required Antar to repatriate $52 million in
allegedly illegal profits, believed to be in Israeli banks, from
selling Crazy Eddie stock.
   Politan has also frozen Antar's assets and appointed a trustee
to trace them.
   The fugitive entrepreneur was last seen by authorities at a Feb.
13 appearance.
   In addition to a criminal contempt finding by Politan, the U.S.
attorney has also filed criminal contempt charges against him.
   The SEC charges Antar and other former Crazy Eddie officials
reaped millions of dollars in illegal trading profits after
inflating the company's income. They allegedly exaggerated
inventory and falsely reduced bills to suppliers.
   There have been numerous sightings of Antar, but none panned
out, said Ray Mack, a U.S. postal inspector investigating the case.
   Antar's wife, former wife, in-laws and friends all say they have
no idea where he is. The SEC even asked actor Jerry Carroll, the
company's manic broadcast pitchman from 1972 to 1989. No luck.
   ``Eddie was always a reclusive guy,'' Carroll said in an
interview. ``If Eddie didn't want to talk to you, he didn't talk to
you.''
   Carroll said he was paid handsomely for making more than 6,000
commercials, and was given options for 81,000 shares of stock in
unsolicited bonuses. The options are now worthless. New management
failed to turn around the teetering chain and went to bankruptcy
court. Crazy Eddie was liquidated last year.
   Its stock had traded as high as $21, and the company had
revenues in 1987 of more than $350 million. Stores were in New
Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.
   Antar's name was rarely mentioned in print without the word
``reclusive'' attached to it.
   The 42-year-old onetime Wall Street darling infrequently
appeared in public. Pictures are few, though the latest shows him,
hair slicked back and beard closely trimmed, holding a U.S.
marshal's processing number. It came after his Feb. 13 court
appearance.
   Known by the nickname Kelso, after the famous racehorse, the
eccentric Antar often wore jogging suits, even when surrounded by
people in black tie and gowns at formal company parties. He kept a
large German shepherd with him, had exercise equipment in his
office and reportedly wore a lucky black sweater for two years.
   Antar grew up in a compact community of Syrian Jews in
Brooklyn's Flatbush section, most of whom trace roots to the
ancient trading city of Aleppo. Many in the remarkably successful
community spend their summers in the Jersey shore town of Deal.
   Antar is ``very bright, very private and right now, very put
upon,'' said his New Jersey lawyer, Jack Arseneault, who denied the
SEC charges and blamed them on the bitter statements of three
disaffected company officials.
   Disgruntled shareholders sued him in 1987 and the U.S. attorney
is seeking a criminal indictment. He also has been embroiled in a
reopened divorce case with his previous wife.

   V. Orville Wright is retiring from the office
of chief executive of MCI Communications Corp., the company said
Friday.
   Wright, 68, will continue as vice chairman and a member of the
board of directors and will be a consultant, MCI said.
   William G. McGowan will resume sole responsibilities as chairman
and chief executive officer of MCI, which is the nation's
second-largest long-distance company.
   Wright, who joined MCI in 1975 as president and chief operating
officer, first retired in 1985 and was succeeded by Bert C. Roberts
Jr., who continues in that position.
   Wright came back to the company as acting chief executive
officer in 1987 when McGowan suffered a heart attack. Wright later
was appointed to the office of chief executive, a position shared
with McGowan.
   Wright previously was an executive at International Business
Machines Corp., Xerox Corp. and RCA.

<TEXT>
   With commands from the ground,
engineers have succeeded in raising the orbit of an errant $150
million communications satellite so that it won't crash through the
atmosphere in the next nine days.
   The higher orbit buys time for the owner, Intelsat, to explore
rescue options. Tony Trujillo, spokesman for the Washington-based
company, said today that a letter was going to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration discussing its help, possibly
a rescue by a space shuttle.
   The satellite was left in an orbit that went within 103.5 miles
of Earth after it failed to separate properly from its Titan 3
rocket after launch on Wednesday. If the satellite had remained at
that altitude, atmospheric drag would pull the spacecraft into the
atmosphere, where it would burn up.
   Using small steering thrusters and hydrazine fuel stored aboard
for small course corrections, engineers boosted the satellite to an
egg-shaped orbit of 161 miles by 276 miles, a satisfactory position
for ``parking.''
   ``This is very good news,'' Trujillo said of the successful
effort to boost the 5-ton satellite. The maneuver does nothing,
however, to restore the satellite to usefulness: it must be in a
geosynchronous orbit, 22,300 miles high, to carry out its functions.
   NASA said once it is asked by Intelsat for help, ``questions of
planning for such a complex mission, crew training and
modifications to the shuttle would have to be evaluated in the
light of the orbit achieved by the Intelsat spacecraft.''
   There were reports, too, that Intelsat was asking the Soviets
for help, but Trujillo said only that ``right now we are
concentrating discussing with NASA the possibility of assistance.''
   The satellite was propelled into space at a cost of about $270
million in the fourth commercial launch of a payload by a U.S.
company.
   It wound up in the wrong orbit after failing to separate
properly from the second stage of its booster rocket. The satellite
was separated about seven hours later by computer commands sent
from Intelsat's headquarters in Washington.
   But the rocket motor that was to have boosted the satellite into
higher orbit remained attached to the second stage booster.
   The Titan's second stage, traveling at about the same speed as
the satellite in the same elliptical orbit 90 to 190 miles above
Earth, has until about Wednesday before falling back to Earth, said
Maj. Thomas Niemann of the U.S. Space Command. The rocket has more
mass than the satellite and more surface area, causing greater
atmospheric drag.
   The U.S. Space Command probably will not know where the
spacecraft will come down until about 12 hours beforehand, Niemann
said.
   John Pike, associate director for space policy for the
Federation of American Scientists, said the satellite is
``worthless'' no matter where it is unless NASA agrees to help.
   ``The best they can do is to hope they get it in some orbit that
would enable a shuttle, probably the American shuttle, to bring it
back down,'' Pike said.
   Before the 1986 Challenger disaster, shuttles brought back two
satellites for refurbishing and crew members repaired two others in
space. Following the explosion, President Reagan and Congress
directed NASA to move away from launching commercial satellites and
devote its efforts to research and development.
   ``There are so many unknowns in this thing,'' NASA spokesman
Karl Kristofferson said. ``First, whether it's doable. Second,
whether it would fit.''
   Martin Marietta Corp., which launched the rocket and satellite,
has not yet determined what went wrong, company spokesman Art Koski
said. Of 142 Titan 3 launches, 136 have been successful.
   The Intelsat VI spacecraft was intended to transmit three TV
channels and up to 120,000 telephone calls simultaneously 22,300
miles above Earth for more than 13 years. It was to have eventually
replaced two older satellites over the Atlantic.
   Intelsat, a not-for-profit international consortium that
operates a global communications satellite system, had not acquired
insurance for Wednesday's launch. Instead, it self-insured the
satellite and launch vehicle through a reserve fund established to
cover failures.
   Martin Marietta's stock dropped $1.375 a share Wednesday as
investors became nervous about the company's possible financial
liability for the $150 million satellite and $115 million rocket.
The stock rebounded Thursday, closing at $41.375, up 12{ cents.
   The company said its financial responsibility ended when the
Titan 3 rocket ignited.
   Under its contract with the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization, or Intelsat, Martin Marietta's financial
responsibility ended before the rocket cleared the launch tower, a
company spokesman said.
   But Intelsat officials declined to comment on Martin's
assessment of its liability for the satellite.
   ``It would be dangerous for us to talk about when their
liability ended and ours began at this time,'' said Intelsat
spokesman Tony Trujillo. ``It could come up in litigation.''
   Wednesday's launch was Intelsat's 44th; 35 were successful.

<HEAD>BTR Launches 1.64-billion Dollar Offer For Norton</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British industrial giant BTR PLC announced today
an unsolicited $1.64 billion tender offer for Norton Co., a U.S.
abrasives manufacturer.
   BTR said it was offering $75 a share for Norton through a U.S.
subsidiary, ER Holdings Inc.
   Norton responded that its board of directors was reviewing the
offer, and would tell shareholders by March 29 of its position on
the bid.
   BTR's finance director, Chris Bull, said the company would
finance the bid with corporate reserves and bank borrowing. He said
he did not know how much debt would be incurred, but added that BTR
could cope with any repayments despite Britain's 15 percent
interest rates.
   Norton had earnings of $85.8 million on sales of $1.53 billion
in 1989.
   BTR, formerly known as British Tire and Rubber, has diverse
activities, including electronics, sports products and
transportation. It had after-tax profit 783 million pounds, or $1.3
billion, on sales of 7.03 billion pounds, or $11.3 billion, last
year.
   Norton stock soared on the news of the bid, rising $15.62{ to
$73.87{ by midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   London's stock market also reacted enthusiastically to the move.
BTR's shares jumped 20 pence, or 32 cents, to close at 437 pence,
or $7.04, on London's Stock Exchange.
   Analysts generally said BTR would benefit from owning Norton
despite recent problems at the U.S. company.
   ``I think it's a very good deal,'' said analyst Jack Jones of
the London investment firm UBS-Phillips and Drew.
   David Ireland, an analyst with Hoare Govett Ltd. said Norton has
``excellent products and good market position.''
   But Scott Fulton, an analyst with Charterhouse Tilney took a
negative view. ``Everybody's been waiting for BTR to make an
acquisition and I don't think people should get excited about this
acquisition,'' he said.
   Norton's main lines of business are in decline globally and the
company suffers from high manufacturing costs, Fulton said.
   BTR Chairman John Cahill said the company would continue its
acquisitive trend in 1990.
   ``We have a number of companies we're looking at,'' Cahill said,
adding that he was targeting the United States as a prime buying
market. ``The United States is in vogue,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Neither side in the 15-day Greyhound bus strike is
confident that renewed talks will produce a settlement, as gunshots
again were fired at a bus today and a striking driver was arrested
in an earlier shooting.
   Federal mediators scheduled separate meetings today in Tucson,
Ariz., with company officials and union negotiators. The two sides
were to meet face-to-face Saturday for the first time since 6,300
drivers and an estimated 3,000 other Greyhound workers walked out.
   Greyhound Lines Inc. Chairman Fred G. Currey on Thursday accused
the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions of terrorism in
connection with shooting attacks on buses and other violence.
   A striking driver was charged today in the shooting Monday of a
Greyhound bus in Farmington, Conn. Roger D. Cawtra, 44, of
Stratford was arrested at his home by state police and charged with
reckless endangerment and weapons offenses, police said. A judge
ordered him held on $100,000 bond.
   A shot fired from a passing car hit the windshield of a bus in
Phoenix early today, police said. Greyhound spokeswoman Ann Wheat
said the glass was not penetrated and no one was injured. She said
the 43 passengers on the bus bound from New York to Los Angeles
were put on another bus.
   Currey said the violence has undermined his optimism at reaching
a settlement.
   ``I guess the best way to characterize my feeling is that I have
high hopes but very low expectations,'' Currey said.
   ``I believe these union leaders ... think they can win this
strike through violence, terrorism and intimidation and if they
think that, then I have very low expectations,'' he said.
   Union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson defended union leaders, though he
acknowledged union members may be responsible for some of the
violence.
   ``Union leaders do not believe violence will solve this
problem,'' he said. ``We have repeatedly gone to union officials at
the local level, imploring them to let their own members know that
this is not a way to solve a strike.''
   Nelon suggested the company is positioning itself to walk out of
the negotiations.
   ``It takes two parties to negotiate,'' Nelson said. ``If one
party is not prepared to negotiate then there can't be
negotiations.''
   Currey said the company was returning to the bargaining table
only because federal mediators indicated it might help end the
strike.
   He would not say if the company has a new offer, repeating past
statements that Greyhound can afford no more than the $63 million,
three-year contract it first offered.
   The strike began March 2 after talks broke down over wages and
job security. Nelson said the two sides are ``not that far apart''
on financial aspects, but differ on grievance procedures.
   Since the walkout began, there have been at least 14 shooting
attacks on Greyhound buses, 46 bomb threats and numerous other
incidents of vandalism or threats, Currey said Thursday.
   In Chattanooga, Tenn., police escorted buses out of town late
Thursday after a second sniper attack in as many days. A bullet
shattered a bus windshield Thursday afternoon shortly after it left
the Chattanooga terminal en route to Detroit, and two shots struck
a bus Wednesday night on Interstate 24. No one was injured in
either incident.
   Also Thursday, strikers and employees were forced to evacuate a
Greyhound maintenance yard in Los Angeles after a caller phoned in
the threat. Bomb squad members found a ticking suitcase in the
cargo area of a bus in the yard but later discovered an alarm clock
and clothing inside, said police Sgt. Tom Jones.
   Greyhound has won court orders barring violence in more than a
dozen cities and reached agreement with the union Thursday to ban
picketing and demonstrations at three Greyhound operations in
Jacksonville, Fla.
   Greyhound, the nation's only intercity bus company, has been
operating at reduced levels since the strike began, using permanent
replacements and union members willing to cross the picket line.
   The company says 394 union drivers are at work, joining 1,002
permanent replacements. The union says only 94 of its drivers have
crossed the line.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar declined against major currencies
except the Canadian dollar in dull European trading on Friday,
weakened by worries over low U.S. economic growth.
   Gold prices regained the $400 level.
   Foreign exchange dealers said hopes of a more robust U.S.
economy were not fulfilled in new statistics on producer prices,
housing starts and industrial production.
   The dollar also was hurt by continuing speculation that the West
German mark will strengthen next week if Sunday's parliamentary
elections in East Germany signal a quickening of German unity.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6235 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6177.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Thursday's quotes
included: 1.6945 West German marks, down from 1.7025; 1.5080 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5222; 5.7245 French francs, down from 5.7545;
1.9077 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9265; 1,251.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,257.25; and 1.1802 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1778.
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 152.50 Japanese yen, up
from 152.47. In London late Friday the dollar closed higher at
152.30 yen.
   Gold bullion prices rose as the dollar declined, going back
above $400 for the first time in four days. But dealers said they
do not expect gold to go much higher because of the lack of
interest.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid of $400.50 a
troy ounce, up from $398.50. The closing bid in Zurich was $401 an
ounce, up from $398.40.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $399.75 bid, up from $397.52
Thursday.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $5.13 a troy
ounce, up from $5.120.

   Prices advanced strongly in moderately active
trading on London's Stock Exchange Friday, as some panic buying in
blue chip stocks and a strong start to Wall Street boosted the
overall market.
   Institutional investors were spotted in the market for the first
time in a long while, dealers said.
   This week's earnings reports from several major British
companies improved market sentiment and encouraged hopes that
British profits will be strong in 1990.
   ``Things are beginning to improve,'' said one market maker.
``All you need is a little bit of buying to set things alight.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 29
points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,263.9, well above the session low of
2,238.8 and just below its peak of 2,264.2.
   Volume came to 485.5 million shares, compared with 350.4 million
Thursday.

<HEAD>Shareholders Approve Recap Plan, Sale of Some Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sea Containers Ltd. announced Friday its
stockholders approved the company's proposed recapitalization,
which involves selling certain container and ferry assets to
Tiphook PLC and Stena AB.
   Part of the proceeds from the asset sales will be used by Sea
Containers to buy back 7 million shares of its common stock at $70
apiece.
   The vote, which occurred Thursday at the annual general meeting
in Hamilton, Bermuda, was 9.9 million shares in favor of the moves
and 1.6 million against.
   The Sea Containers board of directors was re-elected at the
meeting.
   President James B. Sherwood said final sale agreements have been
executed with Stena and Tiphook. The transactions should be
completed by the end of March and the share program would be
carried out by early April.
   Sweden's Stena and Britain's Tiphook had jointly pursued Sea
Containers through a ferry consortium they own together, called
Temple Holdings Ltd. Sea Containers rejected three Temple takeover
proposals, including the latest one worth $1.04 billion.
   Temple in mid-January offered to drop its bid if Sea Containers
agreed to sell portions of its ferry and container businesses to
Tiphook and Stena.
   Sherwood said in a news release that after the recapitalization,
Sea Containers' main areas of operation would be specialized marine
container leasing and related activities, especially refrigerated
container transport.
   Sea Containers also will continue to have interests in ferries
and ports, particularly high speed car and passenger
transportation; and property development, mostly in the United
Kingdom.
   Sea Containers said it earned $100.3 million, or $7.15 a share,
in 1989, up 17.7 percent from $85.2 million, or 5.87 a share, in
1988. Revenue rose about 14 percent to $1 billion from $875.3
million a year earlier.

<HEAD>NBC Agrees to Sell Majority Interest in Cleveland TV Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Broadcasting Co. said Friday it had
agreed to sell a majority interest in its Cleveland television
station WKYC-TV to Multimedia Inc., which would be making its first
major purchase since undertaking a $1.1 billion recapitalization in
1985.
   Terms of the sale and the size of the stake being sold were not
disclosed.
   Multimedia, which owns four television stations and has
interests in newspapers, radio, television programming and cable
TV, would assume complete responsibility for managing and operating
the station.
   WKYC-TV serves the nation's 11th largest TV market and would be
Multimedia's biggest TV property.
   The deal could free NBC to buy another TV station in a larger
market, trimming its holdings to six stations reaching 20 percent
to 21 percent of the country. Its seven stations including
Cleveland reached about 22 percent of the country. Federal
regulations prohibit a company from owning stations with a combined
reach of more than 25 percent of the country.
   NBC would retain a minority interest in the Cleveland station,
but would have no day-to-day role. The station went on the air in
1948.
   The deal is subject to completion of a definitive agreement and
approval by the Federal Communications Commission and the boards of
Multimedia and NBC's parent, General Electric Co.
   NBC said Multimedia approached it with the proposal several
months ago.
   Robert C. Wright, president and chief executive at NBC, said the
proposal offered ``a terrific opportunity to expand our
relationship with an accomplished group of broadcasters.''
   Three of the four Multimedia stations are NBC affiliates _ WLWT
in Cincinnati, WBIR in Knoxville and KSDK in St. Louis. The fourth,
WMAZ in Macon, Ga., is affiliated with CBS.
   ``This was the smallest owned and operated station that NBC
has,'' Walter Bartlett, chairman and chief executive of the
Greenville, S.C.-based company, said in a telephone interview. ``We
knew they were in pursuing a larger market station.''
   Joe Rutledge, an NBC spokesman, said NBC has no immediate plans
to buy another station. But he said the network always has been
interested in ``attractive stations at reasonable prices.''
   He said the Cleveland station has been profitable, but he
declined to reveal its cash flow. Industry analysts said a well-run
station can command a sale price of 12 times its cash flow.
   Multimedia borrowed $1.13 billion in 1985 as part of a
recapitalization but has since reduced its debt to about $700
million, Bartlett said.
   He said the company is about $100 million ahead of where it
expected to be in repaying the $650 million bank debt incurred in
the recapitalization.
   In addition, Bartlett said the company has raised about $30
million to $40 million after taxes from sales of a small newspaper,
several radio stations and an independent television station in
Nashville, Tenn., over the past few years.
   As a result, he said, the company was able to jump at the

   The stock market rallied today in an upbeat
``triple witching hour'' on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 29.28 to 2,725.00
by 2 p.m. EST.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 832 up, 528 down and
526 unchanged.
   Blue chip stocks attracted buy orders at the witching hour,
marking the last trading in a set of options and futures on stock
indexes used by professionals in computerized index arbitrage.
   The market's response was less clear, however, to word that the
producer price of finished goods was unchanged in February after
climbing 1.8 percent the month before.
   The apparent dropoff in inflationary pressures, which had been
widely forecast, was attributed primarily to a decline in energy
prices.
   Brokers said the data, excluding often-volatile food and energy
prices, still suggested a worrisome degree of underlying inflation.
   Norton Co., subject of a $75-a-share bid by BTR PLC, led the
active list and shot up 16| to 74~.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up &rsqb; at 47\; Philip

and International Business Machines, up 1&lsqb; at 108&lsqb;.
   Apple Computer jumped 3} to 40{ as one of the volume leaders in
the over-the-counter market. Late Thursday the company said its
sales and earnings for the quarter that ends March 30 will be
stronger than expected.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.38 to 187.58. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.73 at 364.00.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 158.07 million shares with two

   Topsy-turvy weather is sending wholesale
inflation on a roller-coaster ride so far this year, with prices
unchanged in February after a steep increase a month earlier.
   A sharp drop in energy prices offset increases for other items
and held the Labor Department's Producer Price Index steady overall
last month, the government said Friday.
   It was the best report in six months and welcome relief after
the huge 1.8 percent rise in January. That increase, the largest in
15 years, was driven by a record gain in energy costs and a large
jump in food prices.
   Food costs rose substantially again in February, particularly
vegetables.
   Taken together, the two months represent an annual wholesale
inflation rate of 11.4 percent. But, many analysts believe prices
are falling this month and predict the manufacturing slowdown will
keep the rate for all of 1990 below the 4.8 percent price gain last
year.
   ``Inflation has been capped but it hasn't been broken,'' said
economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   Unusual weather _ a deep freeze around Christmas followed by
unseasonal warmth _ also contributed to sharp swings in other
economic indicators.
   The Federal Reserve Board said industrial production, after
slumping 1 percent in January, bounced back 0.6 percent in
February. Output at utilities fell and rose with the temperature. A
cutback at auto plants followed by a production rebound also
contributed to the overall swing.
   The operating rate at factories, mines and utilities, increased
0.3 percentage point to 82.3 percent of capacity in February.
   Housing starts fell 7 percent in February, returning to a more
normal seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.48 million units after
a record leap of 24.7 percent a month earlier, the Commerce
Department said. Both months were warmer than usual, but rain held
back builders in February.
   Analysts trying to sort through the figures found little to help
them divine the direction of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy.
   The central bank sought to avoid a recession by cutting interest
rates over the last half of 1989. It has left short-term rates
unchanged since late December and now appears more interested in
keeping rates high enough to dampen growth and, consequently,
inflationary pressures.
   ``Federal Reserve policy will be on hold until the direction of
the economy becomes clearer,'' said economist Samuel D. Kahan of
Fuji Securities Inc.
   Kahan said prices excluding the volatile food and energy
sectors, the so-called core rate of inflation, advanced at about
the same rate as previous months. They rose a moderate 0.4 percent
in February after a slight 0.1 percent rise in January.
   Energy prices plunged 5 percent in February after soaring 13.6
percent.
   Fuel oil plummeted 30.2 percent after shooting up 25.3 percent,
the biggest increase and decrease since the department began
tracking that price in 1973.
   Gasoline prices fell 2.3 percent, recovering only partly from a
16.7 percent rise in January. Natural gas edged up 0.1 percent
after jumping 3.2 percent.
   ``The fuel oil people are cutting prices like crazy to get rid
of what they've got. But the gasoline people are anticipating the
driving season and aren't unhappy to see inventories rising,'' said
economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University.
   Food prices rose 0.9 percent, compared with a 2.1 percent jump
in January, the biggest in six years. Vegetable prices last month
shot up 23.3 percent, on top of the 58 percent rise in January.
   The wholesale price of eggs plunged 24 percent and dairy costs
fell 2.7 percent. Both items had been increasing for most of the
previous year. However, chicken prices shot up 8.5 percent and
fruit rose 8 percent.
   ``The revitalized Florida crops are coming back in and we should
see those vegetable prices tumbling in March and April,'' Ratajczak
said.
   Clothing prices rose 1.1 percent for children, 0.7 percent for
women and 0.6 percent for men. The strong dollar, which reduced the
price of imports, should keep clothing prices for continuing higher.
   In other categories, prices held steady for passenger cars,
jumped 2.9 percent for tobacco products and plunged 5 percent for
home electronic equipment.
   The various changes put the index for finished goods at 117.4 in
February. This meant that a hypothetical selection of goods sold
for $100 in 1982, cost $117.40 last month, up from $111.70 a year
earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also
eased in February. Intermediate goods fell 0.7 percent, following a
1.2 percent rise in January, while crude goods increased a moderate
0.4 percent after a 2.4 percent jump a month earlier.
   An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<HEAD>Sober Binge: Brewer Plans Another Responsible Drinking Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By R.B. FALLSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Inc. spends millions of dollars
trying to convince people not to drink the brewer's best-selling
beers, and says it doesn't mind getting only goodwill in return.
   ``We are a big part of society's desire to reduce abuse,'' said
Steve Burrows, vice president for consumer awareness and education
at the world's largest brewery, which commands 42 percent of the
domestic beer market. ``It's an area we feel we have a
responsibility to be in.''
   The brewer is introducing another national advertising campaign
about responsible drinking Tuesday. This one's called ``Family Talk
About Drinking'' and it joins 11 other campaigns the company is
running.
   Busch has pioneered an industry effort to promote sobriety and
distance itself from the beer-guzzling image. Moreover, it's just
good business to remind consumers not to over-indulge, said
Burrows, who has worked solely on alcohol awareness programs for
nearly a year.
   He has a staff of seven and estimates Anheuser-Busch already has
spent $1 million on the new ``Family Talk'' program.
   Last year Anheuser-Busch spent as much on the Know When to Say
When program, which encompasses all its alcohol-awareness
endeavors, as it did on the Michelob Dry rollout, Burrows said.
   Although anti-drinking activists have accused some brewers of
using the sobriety message as a public relations ploy, industry
analysts see no ulterior motives in the push by Busch and other
brewers to combat alcohol abuse.
   George Thompson, an analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
in New York, said it's a logical path to travel for Busch, which
has introduced low-alcohol beer (L.A.) and no-alcohol brew
(O'Doul's) in the last few years.
   Thompson said Busch will never make money on those brands and
likely won't profit from its alcohol awareness programs either.
   ``But it's not something they'll let up on,'' Thompson said.
``They're not trying to impress people, they're trying to solve the
problem.''
   Bob Weinberg, head of of R.S. Weinberg &amp; Associates, St. Louis
research firm that tracks the brewery business, said a good test
was whether people recalled the brand name sponsoring responsible
drinking ads. He passed.
   ``I'm not sure I can distinguish between the brewers,'' said
Weinberg, who is also a professor at Washington University. ``The
message, I remember.''
   The company doesn't expect to strengthen its already dominant
position in the beer industry with ``Family Talk.'' It may even
lose sales.
   ``That's business that we will gladly lose,'' Burrows said.
   Busch is targeting its ``Family Talk'' campaign at a specific
audience, going for the fathers in Sports Illustrated, the mothers
in Good Housekeeping, and both in Newsweek and Parent.
   Its message is mostly common sense. The ads invite readers to
telephone a toll-free number to obtain guidelines that tell parents
how to be a role model, provide the facts about drinking and
driving, enforce rules and encourage positive friendships.
   A six-person staff of expert advisers which helped develop the
guides also advises starting discussions on the subject early, at
about age 9. The guides include sample dialogue to encourage
bringing up the subject informally.
   It may sound simple, but Roger Vogler, a clinical psychologist
from Pomona Collge in Claremont, Calif., and a member of the
advisory board, says it's not.
   ``My experience is that people are surprisingly uninformed about
things that may seem pretty obvious,'' Vogler said. ``A lot of
parents in my experience believe that they are there to enforce the
rules rather than facilitate their kids meeting their own needs.
   ``We don't have a good format for teaching people how to parent
in our society and I think parents need some help.''
   Even before the ad campaign's debut, Burrows spread the
toll-free number by word of mouth through the brewery's
wholesalers. He said there already have been hundreds of calls on
the number (1-800-359-TALK) set up for people to order free copies
of the guide packet.
   Response has been so brisk, Burrows said, that Anheuser-Busch
also is planning to translate the package into Spanish.
   Unlike its other programs, which feature celebrities and sports
figures warning of the evils of alcohol abuse, ``Family Talk'' is
more subtle. The first ad features a small photo of an
old-fashioned bicycle below the message, ``Talk To Your Kid About
Drinking Before He Gets His First Set Of Wheels.''
   It's a different, more low-key approach by a company that spends
most of its advertising dollar on network sports programming.
   As for the ever-burgeoning responsible drinking division at
Busch, Burrows says it's not time to say when yet.
   ``As we fine-tune this effort, if we see an opportunity, we'll
certainly seize it,'' Burrows said. ``We'll continue to address the
issue and we're always looking for new ideas.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Drop On Brazilian Reforms; Grains Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed moderately lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in reaction to a Brazilian
economic reform plan while grain futures finished mostly higher.
   Newly inaugurated Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello
on Friday announced a broad package of economic measures designed
to halt Brazil's runaway inflation rate, including the introduction
of a new currency with free-floating exchange rates.
   Traders speculated that a free-floating currency would encourage
export sales of soybeans from Brazil, the world's second-largest
producer after the United States. But analysts said it was
impossible to predict the ultimate effect of the broad economic
reforms on the soybean market.
   ``The world wants and needs the Brazilian crop but the question
is, given all the economic reforms, how is that crop going to move
to the world,'' said Mickey Luth, oilseeds analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. ``No one knows.''
   Grain futures were led higher by the March wheat contract, which
rose sharply on indications of tight availability of near-term
supplies.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents lower to 5{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.90 a bushel; corn futures
were } cent to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.48 a bushel; oats

<TEXT>
   A quarterly loss of $3.8 million on
sales of $8.2 million was reported Friday by Qintex Entertainment
Inc., a producer and distributor of TV programs that is stalled in
bankruptcy proceedings and looking for a buyer or investor.
   Qintex Entertainment, best known for co-producing the miniseries
``Lonesome Dove,'' is a U.S. affiliate of Qintex Australia Ltd.
   Qintex Australia's $1.5 billion agreement to buy MGM-UA
Communications Co. collapsed for lack of financing last year.
   Qintex Entertainment officials said they were forced into a
Chapter 11 filing last October when Qintex Australia failed to
provide them a promised $5.9 million owed to MCA Inc. in connection
with the distribution of ``The New Leave It to Beaver Show.'' The
amount of its programming has since fallen off.
   Qintex Entertainment said more than 30 potential buyers or
investors had expressed interest through its investment banker,
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. The company has
publicly identified only one of those, SCS Communications Inc., a
media and entertainment company owned by Stephen Swid.
   The earnings reported Friday, the equivalent of a loss of 18
cents per share, were for Qintex Entertainment's second quarter,
which ended Jan. 31.
   During the same period last year, Qintex Entertainment earned
$1.8 million, or 8 cents per share, on revenue of $32.5 million.
   For the first six months of its fiscal year 1990, Qintex
Entertainment lost $9.8 million, or 46 cents per share, on revenue
of $14.5 million. During the same period in 1989, the company
turned a profit of $3.4 million, or 16 cents per share, on sales of
$59.4 million.

<HEAD>Beauty Salons to Get Another Magazine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new magazine, American Style, is making an
appointment for September at 140,000 beauty salons across the
country in the latest media venture aimed at giving advertisers
access to a large audience of women.
   American Style will be an oversized, bimonthly magazine from
Whittle Communications, a Knoxville, Tenn.-based media concern that
had conducted a two-year test of a similar magazine, Southern
Style, in Southern beauty parlors.
   Peter Finn, the Whittle division president reponsible for
American Style, said the magazine will be in beauty parlors which
handle 90 percent of the nation's beauty salon customers.
   He said the magazine, which will feature affordable fashions,
beauty tips and profiles of women who other women admire, should
reach an unduplicated audience of 29 million adult women readers
every quarter.
   ``The location enables us to reach women when they can really
focus on the magazine and obviously, on the advertising,'' Finn
said.
   The announcement of the new magazine comes as another media
company, Communications Venture Group of Rye, N.Y., begins to
distribute Confetti, a series of six separate bimonthly magazines
designed for women in beauty shops.
   Each Confetti magazine will focus on a different topic _ people,
writing, style, home, connections and leisure _ and will be
distributed in about 4,000 salons in department stores and malls.
About 8 million women are expected to read the magazines at least
once every two months.
   Unlike American Style, the publishers of Confetti require that
they be allowed to handle all of the magazines that will be
available in a given beauty salon and to limit that to no more than
four other magazine titles.
   Controlled-circulation magazines such as American Style will be
prohibited from beauty salons signing up to receive Confetti,
according to Dave Smith, a managing director at Communications
Venture Group.
   ``There is a lot of magazine clutter out there,'' he said.
   Smith said his company is focusing on beauty shops located in
stores or near stores because it puts the magazine in the hands of
women who would be in position to act immediately on any
advertising-generated impulses to shop.
   ``A women in a beauty shop on the fifth floor of a department
store will be bumping into the counters of our advertisers as she
leaves,'' he said.
   Murdoch Magazines, a unit of News Corp. Ltd. headed by Rupert
Murdoch, announced last month that it planned to create
commercially-sponsored video programs designed for beauty shop
clients.
   Murdoch's Salon Network would consist of tapes of 30 minute to
40 minute programs including 10 minutes of ads that would be
delivered for replay in at least 3,000 beauty parlors starting June
or July. The creators say 2 million to 2.5 million women are
expected to see the programs while at the beauty shop.
   The shows would contain video versions of stories that have
appeared in Murdoch magazines such as Mirabella, New Woman, New
York and Premiere.
   Advertising rates are just under $1 million for a page in each
of six bimonthly issues of American Style; $300,000 for one page in
each of six bimonthly issues of Confetti; and $20,000 for a
30-second commercial on a Salon Network program.
   Joseph Ostrow, worldwide media director at the advertising firm
Foote Cone Belding Communications in New York, said the new
magazine and video vehicles have potential because they address a
very specific target audience in a setting where the right message
could motivate people to buy a product.
   ``The question is whether the women will indeed read them or
view them. It is one thing to get them into distribution and quite
another to get them read,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Dayton Hudson Corp., a major retailing
company, said Thursday its fourth-quarter profit grew 37 percent
from a year earlier while its 1989 income climbed 43 percent to a
record level.
   The company said it earned $250 million, or $3.50 a share, for
the three months ended Feb. 3, up from $182 million, or $2.31 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 9.4 percent for the 14-week fourth quarter to $4.49
billion from $4.1 billion in 1988's 13-week fourth quarter.
   For the year, the owner of Target discount stores, Mervyn's
stores and Dayton Hudson Department Store Co. said it earned $410
million, or $5.37 a share, up from $287 million, or $3.45 a share,
in fiscal 1988.
   ``We are very pleased with this earnings report, especially
because it follows 1988's record results,'' said Kenneth A. Macke,
Dayton Hudson chairman.
   Revenue for the 53 weeks of fiscal 1989 were $13.64 billion, up
11.8 percent from $12.2 billion in the 52 weeks of fiscal 1988.
   Target posted its 15th consecutive year of record operating
profit, with a 32 percent increase over 1988, Dayton Hudson
reported.
   Mervyn's operating profit increased 40 percent, while Dayton
Hudson Department Store Co.'s operating profit increased 12 percent.
   ``All three of our companies are strong and have great momentum
to capture additional market share,'' Macke said.
   At the end of fiscal 1989, Dayton Hudson Corporation operated
657 stores in 33 states.

   Saab-Scania of America Inc. on Friday recalled
all 25,000 1986 through 1990 model Saab 9000 cars with automatic
transmissions sold in the United States to correct a potential
overheating problem in a lamp switch.
   Saab also said that among those cars were about 14,000 1988
through mid-1989 models recalled to install a bracket to prevent
chafing between a throttle cable and one of three brake fluid
lines. Saab sent letters to owners of those cars on March 5.
   On Friday, Saab mailed notifications to owners in the larger
recall, saying an electric circuit would be modified to eliminate
the possibility of overheating.
   The company, the U.S. importing and marketing arm of Saab-Scania
AB of Sweden, said in a news release received Friday in Detroit it
knew of no accidents or injuries associated with either problem.
Repairs would be performed for free.

<HEAD>West Point-Pepperell Sells Some Divisions to Bidermann Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bidermann Industries Corp. said Friday it has
agreed to buy three divisions of Cluett, Peabody and Co. at a price
an analyst said was well below what cash-strapped industrialist
William Farley had hoped to get.
   The purchase price was about $350 million in cash and a $60
million note due March 2000, according to a joint statement by
Farley's West Point-Pepperell Inc. and Bidermann.
   The note provides for no principal payments until maturity.
Interest will accrue and be added to principal until January 1998,
after which interest will be payable in cash, the statement said.
   ``Farley started to sell those at $600 million,'' analyst Edward
F. Johnson of Johnson Redbook Service in New York said of the sale.
``The price is down and not all of it is in cash.''
   ``They are still in a tight position financially,'' Johnson said.
   The sale follows renegotiation with bankers Wells Fargo &amp; Co.
and Bankers Trust Co. of a $1.2 billion loan, which buys Farley
more time to complete his takeover of Georgia-based Pepperell.
   Cluett, Peabody is a leading manufacturer of menswear. The
transaction involves divisions that make and sell Arrow shirts,
Schoeneman suits and Gold Toe socks.
   Farley, the Chicago-based industrialist who acquired Pepperell
in a hostile takeover last year for $1.56 billion, is selling the
Cluett, Peabody divisions to get through a cash squeeze.
   The agreement with Bankers Trust and Wells Fargo, announced
earlier this week, extends through 1994 a loan that was set to
mature on March 31. The loan package consists of a term loan of
$550 million and a revolving credit line of up to $650 million.
   Lenders previously had agreed to extend the loan only if Farley
could sell some of Pepperell's assets.
   There was concern that Farley would default on the $1.04 billion
bridge loan he got to buy West Point.
   The sale completes negotiations that were begun last fall, when
Bidermann and West Point announced that an agreement had been
reached to acquire Cluett, Peabody.
   Bidermann Industries is the principal American subsidiary of
Bidermann Industries Corp., based in France.
   The Bidermann group of companies manufactures and markets a wide
range of men's and women's designer apparel internationally,
including labels by Daniel Cremieux, Daniel Hechter, Kenzo, Ralph
Lauren, Bill Robinson and Yves Saint Laurent.

<HEAD>High-Speed Network Links Scientists Across Atlantic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and European scientists will be able to
compare notes across the Atlantic with a new, high-speed data link
unveiled Thursday by the National Science Foundation.
   The foundation said it was extending the nation's largest
computer network used in science and education, NSFNET, to Europe,
thanks to support from International Business Machines Corp. and
MCI Communications Corp.
   Stephen S. Wolff, a division director of the foundation, said
the new trans-Atlantic link will speed the exchange of information
in areas such as global weather changes, mapping the human gene,
analyzing reactions in particle physics and predicting weather.
   European and U.S. researchers will be able to exchange
information at the network speed of 1.5 million bits per second, or
almost 200,000 characters per second. That is the equivalent of
about 50 single spaced pages of text a second.
   But even that blinding speed _ news agencies tranbsmit text at
150 characters per second, and facsimile machines can reach 1,200
characters per second _ is not enough for today's computer networks
to handle sophisticated graphics from several locations at once.
   Later this year, NSFNET should go to 45 million bits per second,
about 5.6 million characters per second, in the United States,
according to the announcement of the new network at the National
Net '90 networking conference.
   The trans-Atlantic fiber optic cable will remain limited to 1.5
million bits per second.
   Network officials demonstrated prototype equipment that
transmitted information between Washington and Ann Arbor, Mich. at
45 million bits per second.
   ``It is clear that this kind of collaboration has the potential
to speed up the research process and lead us to new scientific
breakthroughs that today we cannot even imagine,'' said Wolff.
   The connection between NSFNET and the European Academic
Supercomputer Initiative Network will be made at the Cornell
National Supercomputer Facility at Ithaca, N.Y., and at CERN, the
European Laboratory for Particle Physics, near Geneva, Switzerland.
   NSFNET is a partnership of the foundation, IBM, MCI, the state
of Michigan and the Merit Computer Network, a consortium of eight
Michigan universities.
   NSFNET links more than 1,000 U.S. universities, business and
government research networks and provides access to supercomputers
financied by the foundation.

   When Generes
and large food price rises, which had propelled the overall index
to the largest increase in 15 years.
   Figures for the two months, taken together, represent an
annualized wholesale inflation rate of 11.4 percent. However,
economists do not expect anything approaching that for the entire
year.
   Most anticipate prices will rise between 4 percent and 4.5
percent in 1990, slightly lower than the 1989 rate of 4.8 percent.
   In two other economic reports released today, the government
said housing starts returned to a more normal, slower pace in
February and industrial production bounced back from a January
decline.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonably adjusted annual rate of 1.48 million units in
February, down 7 percent, after leaping a revised 24.7 percent in
January.
   The Federal Reserve said industrial production rose 0.6 percent
in February following a 1.0 percent drop in January's output. In a
separate report, the Fed said the operating rate of the nation's
factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3 percentage point to 82.3
percent in February.
   Energy prices in February plunged 5 percent after soaring 13.6
percent in January.
   The effect of the weather showed up most strongly in fuel oil
prices, which rocketed 25.3 percent in January and plummeted 30.2
percent in February. They were the biggest increase and decrease
since the department began tracking that price in 1973.
   Gasoline prices fell 2.3 percent last month after rising 16.7
percent in January. Natural gas prices edged up 0.1 percent after
jumping 3.2 percent in the previous month.
   Food prices in February rose 0.9 percent, compared with January
when they rose 2.1 percent, the biggest jump in six years.
   Vegetable prices last month shot up 23.3 percent, on top of the
58 percent rise in January. The holiday freeze killed vegetable
crops from Texas to Florida. However, analysts expect vegetable
costs to subside this spring as new crops are harvested.
   In other good news for grocery buyers, the wholesale price of
eggs plunged 24 percent while dairy costs fell 2.7 percent. Both of
those categories had been increasing for most of the previous year.
   However, chicken prices shot up 8.5 percent and fruit rose 8
percent.
   Prices excluding the volatile food and energy sectors rose a
moderate 0.4 percent in February after a slight 0.1 percent rise in
January. Economists often use this so-called core rate as a better
indication of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.
   In other categories, prices rose 1.1 percent for men's and boy's
clothing, held steady for passenger cars, jumped 2.9 percent for
tobacco products and plunged 5 percent for home electronic
equipment.
   The various changes put the index for finished goods at 117.4 in
February. This meant that a hypothetical selection of goods which
cost $100 in 1982, cost $117.40 last month, up from $111.70 a year
earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process also
eased in February. Intermediate goods fell 0.7 percent, following a
1.2 percent rise in January, while crude goods increased a moderate
0.4 percent following a 2.4 percent jump a month earlier.
   An example of the three stages would be bread for finished
goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

<TEXT>
   The dollar declined Friday against most major
foreign currencies with buyers focusing on the Swiss franc and West
German mark.
   Gold prices gained in domestic and overseas dealings.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for a troy ounce
of gold at $400 as of 4 p.m. EST, up $1.80 from Thursday's late
bid. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for March delivery
settled at $399.60 a troy ounce, $1.50 higher than Thursday.
   Currency dealers said a bearish attitude toward the dollar
prevailed in foreign exchange markets. Interest in trading dollars
slackened in the New York afternoon, which is typical before a
weekend.
   Traders usually are reluctant to establish significant new
positions on Fridays for fear developments over the weekend could
have an impact on currency values. This was especially true this
Friday because of Sunday's parliamentary elections in East Germany.
   There has been speculation that the West German mark will
strengthen next week if the East German elections signal a
quickening of German unity.
   As trading ended in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6980
West German marks, down from 1.6990 marks late Thursday.
   Meanwhile, a batch of statistics about the economy's performance
in February furnished fresh evidence of weakness. Judging by the
reports, analysts said they don't foresee any imminent change in
Federal Reserve credit policy, which could influence the dollar's
value against its foreign counterparts.
   Marc Chandler, a currency market analyst at MMS International in
Chicago, said stronger demand for Swiss francs also caused dollar
selling.
   Chandler said the Japanese yen remained the weakest of the major
currencies because interest rates in that country have stayed put
rather than gone up as many currency traders expected.
   One dollar bought 152.65 Japanese yen late in New York compared
to 152.285 yen on Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at
152.50 Japanese yen, up from 152.47. In London late Friday the
dollar closed higher at 152.30 yen.
   Also in London, one British pound cost $1.6235 late Friday, more
expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $1.6177. Later, in New
York, a pound fetched $1.6190, down from $1.6215 on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
Thursday, included: 1.5095 Swiss francs, down from 1.5180; 5.736
French francs, down from 5.7415; 1,253.00 Italian lire, down from
1,255.00; and 1.18285 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18085.
   Selected late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Thursday's late levels, were: 1.6945 West German marks, down from
1.7025; 1.5080 Swiss francs, down from 1.5222; 5.7245 French
francs, down from 5.7545; 1.9077 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9265;
1,251.00 Italian lire, down from 1,257.25; and 1.1802 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1778.
   Gold and silver prices rose as the dollar declined.
   A troy ounce of gold bullion was bid at $400.50 late in London,
the major European precious metals market, up from $398.50. The
closing bid in Zurich was $401 an ounce, up from $398.40. Earlier
in Hong Kong gold closed at $399.75 bid, up from $397.52 Thursday.
   In New York, silver bullion for March delivery closed at $5.093
a troy ounce, up from $5.079 on Thursday. Silver bullion traded
late in London at a bid of $5.13 a troy ounce, up from $5.120.

<HEAD>Norton Targeted by British Company in Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British industrial conglomerate BTR PLC offered
$1.64 billion Friday to acquire Norton Co., the Worchester-based
abrasives manufacturer, in an unsolicited tender offer that sent
Norton shares skyrocketing.
   London-based BTR, which has international operations ranging
from building materials to sporting goods, offered $75 a share for
Norton through a U.S. subsidiary, ER Holdings Inc.
   BTR also threatened a proxy fight to win control of Norton's
board if the company tried to block its tender offer.
   Norton stock soared on news of the bid, rising $16.62{ to
$74.87{ a share on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Norton spokesman Francis J. Doherty Jr. said Norton's board of
directors was reviewing the offer and would inform shareholders of
its position on the bid by March 29.
   Norton, the world's largest manufacturer of abrasives, also
produces ceramics, plastics and chemical process products.
   The company earned $85.8 million on sales of $1.53 billion in
1989. It employs 16,600 people and operates 120 plants in the
United States and 27 in other countries.
   Operations of BTR, formerly known as British Tire and Rubber,
include electronics, sports products and transportation under such
companies as Stewart Warner in the United States, Borg Warner in
Australia, Dunlop Slazenger and Rockwell Valve.
   The company had an after-tax profit of $1.3 billion on sales of
$11.3 billion last year.
   BTR's finance director, Chris Bull, said the company would
finance the bid with corporate reserves and bank borrowing. He said
he did not know how much debt would be incurred, but added that BTR
could cope with any repayments.
   BTR chairman John C. Cahill wrote in a letter to Norton chief
executive John H. Nelson that he hoped the transaction would be
``enthusiastically supported'' by Norton's nearly 6,000
stockholders.
   But he said BTR would consider proposing an alternative slate of
nominees for directors at Norton's annual meeting April 26 ``to
ensure that Norton's board does not, either through action or
inaction, deny Norton stockholders the opportunity to accept our
all-cash offer.''
   Cahill's letter also included a pledge not to close any of
Norton's manufacturing facilities and to keep Norton's corporate
headquarters in Worcester.
   British analysts generally said BTR would benefit from owning
Norton despite recent problems at the U.S. company.
   ``I think it's a very good deal,'' said analyst Jack Jones of
the London investment firm UBS-Phillips and Drew.
   David Ireland, an analyst with Hoare Govett Ltd. in London, said
Norton has ``excellent products and good market position.''
   But Scott Fulton, an analyst with Charterhouse Tilney in London,
took a negative view. ``Everybody's been waiting for BTR to make an
acquisition and I don't think people should get excited about this
acquisition,'' he said.
   Norton's main lines of business are in decline globally and the
company suffers from high manufacturing costs, Fulton said.
   Cahill said BTR would continue its acquisitive trend in 1990.
   ``We have a number of companies we're looking at,'' Cahill said,
adding that he was targeting the United States as a prime buying
market. ``The United States is in vogue,'' he said.
   A number of BTR's businesses were acquired, including
Chicago-based Stewart Warner, a maker of electronic and fabricated
metal products and hardware that BTR bought acquired in late 1987.
   BTR mounted a $1.8 billion hostile takeover attempt for
Britain's Pilkington Brothers PLC, the giant glassmaker, in late
1986 but later dropped the bid amid a domestic political uproar
over the move.

   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC said Friday that
William F. Reilly has resigned as president and chief operating
officer of its Macmillan Inc. subsidiary and will be replaced by
David Shaffer, who headed the group's electonic publishing
operations worldwide.
   Reilly resigned to devote full time to management of K-III
Holdings, a partnership created more than a year ago by several top
Macmillan executives with financial support from the investment
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Before taking responsibility for Maxwell's electronic publishing
operations, Shaffer was president of Official Airline Guides, which
Maxwell acquired from Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. for $750 million in
1988.
   Shaffer has been on the board of London-based Maxwell
Communications since last November. Macmillan, based in New York,
is one of the world's largest publishing and information services
concerns.
   K-III Holdings was formed in February 1989 to acquire and manage
properties in the publishing, information and related fields. It
already has purchased two properties once owned by Macmillan,
Macmillan Books Clubs Inc. and Intertec Publishing Corp., which
publishes trade magazines and technical books.
   On Thursday, Maxwell said it had rejected an offer of
undisclosed size from K-III Holdings for Maxwell's 56 percent stake
in Berlitz International Inc., the language services company.
   While president of Macmillan, Reilly also was president and
chief executive of K-III Holdings.
   ``I fully understand Bill's desire to be an entrepreneur, but
we're sorry to see him go,'' Maxwell Communication Chairman Robert
Maxwell said in a statement.
   Reilly, 51, has been president of Macmillan since May 1981 and
remained in that position after Maxwell Communication acquired
Macmillan for $2.6 billion in November 1988.
   He said in a telephone interview that his goal is to build K-III
Holdings' annual revenue to $500 million within three years from
the present $200 million.
   Reilly said he is interested in acquiring publishing and
information companies, direct marketing or mail order operations,
directories and other specialized information operations. ``We are
going to stay away from these big trade publishing companies,'' he
said.
   Charles McCurdy, an executive vice president of K-III and former
chief financial officer of Macmillan, said K-III hopes to ``build a
large diversified company without resorting to the over-leveraged
financing that has been the downfall of many companies in recent
years.''

   A year after the Alaska oil spill, some
experts still point to Exxon Corp.'s reaction as a virtual primer
on how not to handle a disaster.
   ``To be nice, I'd say they did not distinguish themselves,''
said Gerald Meyers, former chairman and chief executive officer of
American Motors and author of a book on corporate crisis control,
``When It Hits The Fan.''
   ``To be more blunt, they screwed up,'' he said. ``For whatever
reason, the company appeared to be indifferent or uncaring or
unconcerned while hundreds of sea otters and all kinds of wildlife
were washing up on shore.''
   Marilou Hedlund, managing director of the Hill &amp; Knowlton public
relations firm in Chicago, said several new clients came to her
saying, in essence, ``We don't want to have what happened to Exxon
happen to us.''
   Reporters had trouble getting comment from Exxon about the March
24 spill, and company Chairman Lawrence G. Rawls stayed away from
the area and didn't appear before reporters until April 18.
   Within hours of the spill, a local group volunteered to mobilize
fishing boats to help move in equipment to keep the oil from
spreading. But, in another example of what critics label Exxon's
clumsiness, the company never returned their call, the group's
members said. By the time Exxon responded with its own equipment, a
storm had moved through the area and spread the oil over a wider
region.
   The Associated Press called Exxon asking to discuss its handling
of spills, but officials at the corporation's New York
headquarters, its subsidiary's headquarters in Houston and its
Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J., all declined comment.
   Ms. Hedlund and other crisis managers, a burgeoning sub-field of
public relations, live by a simple maxim: There's no substitute for
practice.
   ``We do crisis training with our clients, actually create an
incredible crisis and simulated news and radio reports and see how
they handle them,'' she said.
   Ms. Hedlund said she also refers clients to several ``textbook
examples'' of good crisis management, including United Airlines'
handling of the crash of Flight 232 in Iowa last summer and Johnson
&amp; Johnson's of the nightmarish Tylenol poisonings of the early
1980s.
   ``The key to the success of both cases was the company's
immediate release of everything they knew and their handling of
victims' families,'' she said.
   Meyers said British Petroleum's recent oil spill off Huntington
Beach, Calif., provides another good example.
   ``They learned from Exxon, no doubt,'' he said. ``BP's chairman,
Jim Ross, flew there almost immediately and showed a take-charge
attitude. That was a very bad scene _ an oil spill right in the
cradle of the environmental movement. But they weathered the
storm.''
   Exxon recently halted oil loading and unloading operations at
its only East Coast refinery after three spills in two months in
New York City-area waters, even though only one of the spills was
directly tied to Exxon property.
   The shutdown illustrates Exxon's tension over its public image
in the year since its tanker split open in Alaska's Prince William
Sound, said Simon Trimble, international oils analyst for the
investment firm Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
   These days, Trimble said, ``it doesn't take 10 million barrels
of oil spilled into American waters for there to be a negative
impact on Exxon.''

   From a helicopter, the wave-washed
beach looks as if the worst oil spill in U.S. history had never
touched it.
   Silvery sticks of driftwood poke through a deep blanket of snow,
and smooth gray pebbles roll in the surf under the gaze of a bald
eagle perched in a shoreside spruce.
   But the view doesn't impress Joe Bridgman of the Alaska
Department of Environmental Conservation. Dashing out as the
chopper lands, he digs into the cobble beach and quickly finds what
he knew he would.
   ``Oil,'' he says. ``Smell it?''
   The pungent odor of petroleum wafts through the air as the hole
turns black with crude oil, an oozing remnant of the 10.8 million
gallons spilled into Prince William Sound last March 24 by the
tanker Exxon Valdez.
   Bridgman scoops up a shovelful of gravel, lugs it to the water's
edge and dumps it in. A rainbow sheen of oil spreads across the
water.
   ``Hundreds of gallons of oil are locked up under this beach,''
he says. ``And this isn't isolated. There are hundreds of beaches
all over the sound that are still oiled, and the oil is slowly
bleeding out.
   ``The beaches can look beautiful at the surface, but you can dig
down, in this case just a few inches below the surface, and find
lots of oil. Now, is that a threat or isn't it?''
   A year after the wreck of the Exxon Valdez, the question clings
like the oil under this Perry Island beach. Certainly, the worst is
over; thousands of dead birds no longer wash up on shorelines as
they did last summer.
   But assessing the continuing damage wrought by the nation's most
extensive _ and expensive _ oil spill has just begun. As a growing
slick of lawyers haggles over who is to blame, Exxon Corp. and
government agencies debate how to clean up what's left and
scientists track wildlife populations' first steps on the long road
to recovery.
   Any hope of a quick solution faded last summer as oil from the
Exxon Valdez spread across 1,100 miles of Alaska's wild southern
coast.
   A cleanup army of 12,000 workers polished rocks by hand, blasted
beaches with hot water and sprayed fertilizer to promote the growth
of oil-eating microbes.
   But when Exxon suspended its $2 billion cleanup in
mid-September, it had recovered only 5 percent to 9 percent of the
oil spilled, state officials estimate. About 20 percent to 40
percent is believed to have evaporated. That leaves 50 percent to
75 percent of the oil in the water, on the ocean bottom or on
beaches.
   Some was soaked up by unwilling sponges: the seabirds, eagles
and sea otters whose carcasses now lie frozen in five vans in an
Anchorage storage yard, awaiting their day as physical evidence in
court.
   Workers found more than 1,000 dead otters, a sizable chunk of
the spill area's total population of 15,000 to 22,000.
   Many of Prince William Sound's 3,000 bald eagles also suffered;
at least 151 died, most poisoned by scavenging the oily remains of
some of the 34,400 dead seabirds recovered.
   Those numbers alone make the Valdez spill the most lethal ever,
but scientists say the actual death count is much higher,
estimating that up to 90 percent of the seabirds caught in oil sank
from sight or drifted out to sea.
   Exxon notes the spill did not wipe out any species and says
surviving animals and birds will rebuild populations. But that may
take up to 70 years for some hard-hit seabird colonies, U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service researchers say.
   ``We never claimed that the spill put any animal on the
endangered species list, but that's missing the point,'' said Fish
and Wildlife spokesman Bruce Batten. ``It's still the greatest
human-caused wildlife disaster that this agency knows about.''
   Oily carcasses were an obvious measure of the spill's impact,
but victims also included less visible members of the ecosystem,
such as young salmon and tiny intertidal creatures.
   Assessment studies for these populations are not finished, and
even preliminary findings are hard to come by _ researchers have
been told by lawyers to save their findings for court, where it
seems nearly everyone involved in the spill is headed.
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, skipper of the Exxon Valdez, is on trial
this month in Anchorage on charges including criminal mischief and
drunken driving of his vessel, and a federal grand jury recently
issued criminal indictments against Exxon, starting a case that
could take years to finish.
   Exxon already faces more than 150 civil lawsuits.
   Fishermen sued because of lost seasons. Tour-boat operators sued
because fewer people wanted to cruise an oiled sound. The state
sued, claiming the company was negligent in responding to the
spill, only to be countersued by Exxon, which claimed state
officials hindered the use of chemical dispersants that could have
broken up large quantities of oil early on.
   Information about the spill is filtered through this litigious
atmosphere, making much of it suspect. Exxon distributes
before-and-after pictures of cleaned beaches; Bridgman and other
state officials, accusing Exxon of ``myth-making,'' eagerly make
room for journalists on flights to oiled beaches.
   State officials cite an October survey that showed 117 miles of
shoreline remained moderately or heavily oiled, with oil more than
two feet deep in some spots. They say observers flying over the
sound still report 15 to 20 oil sheens bleeding off beaches daily.
   Exxon officials, meanwhile, say their winter monitoring of 64
sites shows wind and waves have scoured away, on average, more than
half the surface oil left in September, and up to 80 percent of the
buried oil.
   ``From a layman's point of view, what's left out there is really
insignificant,'' said Exxon scientist Andy Teal.

   Both the state and Exxon figures may be accurate, but even the
best studies of the spill's effects are mere snapshots of a rugged,
sparsely populated region the size of New Jersey, Maryland and
Delaware combined.
   The Coast Guard has declared some sort of cleanup must resume
May 1, but nobody has committed to how much or what kind. Decisions
will be made after another survey of beach conditions next month.
   In general, exposed beaches eroded by winter storms appear to
have fared the best, but surface oil remains thick in many
sheltered coves and estuaries.
   Areas with oil hidden beneath the surface, such as the Perry
Island beach Bridgman visited, may prove the most troublesome.
State officials believe many of those beaches would benefit from
intensive work, such as digging up gravel, tumbling it in
rock-washing machines and replacing it.
   While that would kill nearly all living organisms, it would
provide a clean slate for populations to rebuild, said Steve
Provant, the Department of Environmental Conservation's spill
coordinator.
   But Exxon officials say such intrusive techniques could do more
harm than good.
   Some federal authorities are inclined to agree, recalling last
summer's heavy-handed invasion of the Alaska wilderness.
   Frightened animals had to flee repeatedly from buzzing
helicopters, and cleanup crews left behind tons of plastic boom
material, absorbent pompons and other litter on previously pristine
beaches. Even scientists made their mark, painting rocks with
flourescent paint and tying orange plastic flagging to trees.
   ``You can see these things a mile away, and they're in areas
where people otherwise would be having a quality wilderness
experience,'' said Nancy Lethcoe, a sailboat-tour operator in
Valdez.
   Lethcoe remembers a Prince William Sound where you could stand
on a lonely beach and feel you were the first human ever there. It
was a place where the world still felt big. Now the world seems
suddenly smaller, civilization's reach extended by the greasy
fingers of an oil spill.
   Lethcoe said she'll leave the blaming to the lawyers. When she
goes out on the sound these days, she focuses on nature's
recuperative powers. It works until she discovers that oil has
found another of her favorite hideaways.
   ``When I know an area is oiled, I can brace myself,'' she said.
``But when I find an area that wasn't supposed to be oiled, it
brings back the whole trauma of the spill. It brings back the
pain.''

<HEAD>Citicorp Reorganizing Real Estate Division</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp said Friday it was reorganizing its
commercial real estate division, a move analysts linked to a rise
in bad loans because of a downturn in the market nationwide.
   Under the shift, Citicorp is expected to de-emphasize lending to
large building projects and concentrate on real estate activities
that generate fees for the bank, such as finding investors for
projects.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest lender among commercial banks in
the field, had $12.6 billion in domestic real estate loans at the
end of 1989. Nonperforming loans totaled $1.16 billion, up from
$548 million a year earlier.
   ``We've seen deterioration in real estate portfolios across the
board for most large banks,'' said Richard Mueller, a banking
analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Citi may be looking at not building up the loans
outstanding,'' he said. ``It doesn't make sense to (expand) a real
estate loan portfolio if it's going to continue to demand capital
and the returns may not be sufficient.''
   The real estate industry in several regions of the country has
weakened recently because of excess capacity following expansion in
the early- and mid-1980s.
   Overbuilding was fueled by easy credit from banks and savings
and loans and an assumption that the market would continue
expanding. Analysts said that has led to a reduction of new
construction to allow demand to catch up with expansion.
   Among the hardest hit banks has been the Bank of New England, an
aggressive lender during the mid-1980s construction boom, which
lost $1.1 billion in 1989, largely due to bad loans.
   Along with continuing problems in the Southwest tied to a
recession there, the Northeast has the weakest commercial real
estate market now, analysts said. Florida, Arizona and the
mid-Atlantic region also have been softening.
   Citicorp said it ``remains committed to this business and we
intend to grow and expand our franchise to deliver financial
solutions to our clients.''
   The bank suggested that increasing competition from abroad also
played a role in the reorganization. Foreign banks involved in a
rising level of cross-border real estate investments have pushed
down profit margins on international and high-grade projects.
   Citicorp suffered a sharp rise in nonperforming loans, which are
loans on which borrowers are not paying interest but have not yet
defaulted, in the first six months of 1989. The bank has said it
expects an increase in the nonperforming loans in 1990.
   According to published reports, the restructuring will create
two new divisions, traditional real estate lending and
fee-generating activities such as arranging sales, debt and equity
for projects.

   When Exxon Corp. returns to the oiled
beaches of Prince William Sound this summer, its cleanup will be
smaller than last year's and use mostly low-impact techniques,
company officials said Thursday.
   Lee Raymond, Exxon Corp. president, said at a news conference
that winter storms had cleaned some of the gummy residue of the
nation's worst oil spill, caused when the Exxon Valdez ran aground
March 24 on a charted reef.
   But he said a tour of the beaches a week and a half ago showed
him that much work remains to be done beyond the $2 billion the
company reports it has already spent on the effort.
   Raymond declined to say how many people would join the clean-up
effort.
   ``Significantly less than were involved last year,'' he said.
``We would hope we could get the job done this year. But that's
based on information that won't be available until the end of
April.''
   David Kennedy, oil spill coordinator for the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, said earlier this week that he
expected the Exxon workforce to number in the hundreds, rather than
approach the 10,000 hired last year.
   NOAA has suggested Exxon crews pick up tarballs and oiled debris
by hand, break up asphalt and tar mats with shovels, and spray
fertilizer over the contaminated sand and gravel to promote natural
bacteria which eat oil.
   Only in extreme cases should heavy machinery be brought in,
Kennedy said. Heavy machinery such as plows can be used to turn
over gravel to expose it to oxygen and sunlight, helping the
natural break-down of oil.
   NOAA and the state have recommended the extreme measure of
digging up the sand, washing it and putting it back on beaches
where people gather shellfish for food. The agencies say that the
short-term damage would be overshadowed by the longterm gains.
   Otto Harrison, Exxon Alaska operations manager, said the company
will use clean-up techniques this summer generally ``less intrusive
on the environment'' than the hot water and steam-hose baths
employed last year.
   They range from ``bioremediation'' _ using the oil-eating
bacteria _ to simply removing the oiled sediment.
   ``To dig it up is the most intrusive thing you can do,''
Harrison said. ``We don't know if the benefits are worth it.''
   A multi-agency group is to conduct a shoreline survey in April
and turn in a work plan by May 1, Harrison said. Work will begin
the first of May or as soon as weather permits, Harrison said.
   Exxon's plan must be approved by Coast Guard Adm. David
Ciancaglini, the federal on-scene coordinator.
   Harrison said some sections of the shoreline most exposed to
wind and wave action are 50 percent cleaner than they were when
Exxon clean-up workers left the coast in September.
   ``The storms did a little better than we'd hoped,'' Harrison
said. ``And we're not through the winter yet.''
   The Exxon Valdez leaked nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope
crude oil into the clear waters of Prince William Sound, staining
beaches, shutting down fishing seasons and killing countless birds
and mammals.
   Exxon said more than 25 studies have been done over the winter,
most of which show significant shoreline improvement, excellent
water quality, no missing species and no stressed animals.
   ``Fin fish are safe for consumption. Generally, the same is true
for shellfish except for those in the Windy Bay area,'' Harrison
said.
   Responding to a reporter's question, the officials said they
didn't plan to hire any ``rock polishers,'' as the company did last
year.
   ``Wiping rocks with rags was never a primary technique,''
Harrison said. ``The material on the rocks this year is pretty
heavy. Bioremediation and removal will be the primary tools.''

   The Seagram Co. Ltd., the distilled spirits,
wine and soft drink giant, said Thursday its profit rose 22.9
percent in the fourth quarter and 20.5 percent for the year.
   Edgar Bronfman Jr., president and chief operating officer, said
the results reflected marked increases in all beverage operations,
full-year contributions from the Martell and Tropicana lines
acquired in April 1988 and a strong performance from Seagram's 24
percent stake in DuPont Co.
   For the three months ended Jan. 31, the Montreal-based Seagram
said it earned $146.2 million, or $1.53 a share, up from $119
million, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the fourth quarter rose 7.8 percent to $1.69 billion
from $1.57 billion a year earlier.
   For the year, Seagram said it earned $710.6 million, or $7.37 a
share, up from $589.5 million, or $6.12 a share, in the previous
fiscal year.
   Annual revenue rose 10.4 percent to $5.58 billion from $5.06
billion a year earlier.
   Among Seagram's products are Chivas Regal and Glenlivet Scotch
Whiskies, Crown Royal and Seagram's V.O. Canadian Whiskies,

   The government spent more than $1 million too
much on no-bid contracts to put the green and the black in the
nation's greenbacks, according to a congressional report released
Thursday.
   The General Accounting Office also said the head of the company
that got a contract to supply ink for the nation's currency was a
friend of the then-director of the head the Bureau of Engraving and
Printing, the government's money-printer.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, described the contract as ``a highly
questionable procurement.''
   He said the government was offered a price for ink in 1988, when
contracts became competitive, that was $1.3 million cheaper than
the same supplier sold to the government on a non-competitive bases
in 1986. The savings would have been higher still if the government
had let potential ink suppliers compete for the contract from the
start, he added.
   Beginning in 1982, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing stopped
making its own black and green dollar-printing ink and began buying
it from the U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss company, SICPA, S.A.
   In 1986 the contract was opened to competition and SICPA offered
the highest of four bids, the report said. Complaints about ink
fumes led the government to cancel two tests of the offered inks
and throw out all the bids. SICPA continued as the government's
single supplier and the contract process dragged on for another two
years.
   Bids were solicited again in 1988 and SICPA reduced its price by
10 percent to submit the lowest bid. Other bidders increased their
prices over the 1986 proposals, the report said.
   But even before the 1986 proposals, said the GAO _ the
investigative arm of Congress _ SICPA President Maurice Amon and
then-Bureau of Engraving and Printing Director Robert Leuver were
apparently becoming friends. They took a 1985 trip to Brazil and
traveled in 1986 to the Far East with U.S. Treasurer Katherine
Ortega.
   The Brazil trip was billed as an inspection of an underground
inkmoving system at a SICPA plant. But the plant had no underground
inkmoving system, the report said.
   In 1987, according to the GAO, Leuver suggested another
sole-source contract for SICPA and, triggering an internal
confrontation with Ortega, Ortega's deputy and Peter Daly, then
Leuver's deputy and now the bureau's director.
   ``Leuver was not involved in ink procurement matters'' after
that and retired a year later, the report said.
   Although the government spends only about $11.2 million annually
on ink for American money, said Glenn, the report highlights the
need to ensure there are no personal relationships between agency
chiefs and contractors.
   ``Procurement integrity is not some theoretical abstract,'' said
Glenn, who heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which
is looking into government contracting.
   Daly did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

   President Bush said Thursday he would appoint
a Michigan real estate executive to the board overseeing his
savings and loan bailout.
   Robert C. Larson, chief executive officer of the Taubman Company
in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., was named to one of two vacant seats on
the five-member Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who heads the board, said
he expects the White House to announce the fifth member next week.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Housing Secretary Jack
Kemp are also members.
   The board sets policy and controls the purse strings of the
bailout agency created last August.
   Congressional Democrats have complained that Bush waited until
after most of the bailout policies were in place before naming the
public members of the board, who were supposed to balance the
influence of the government officials.
   Brady said the appointments were slow because the administration
sought people experienced in real estate disposal. That complicated
clearance checks for possible conflicts of interest, he said.
   ``We've done the right thing and gotten people who really know
what they're doing, instead of just a name,'' he said.
   On another matter, the oversight board voted unanimously to
clear the way for state housing agencies to provide low-cost
mortgages to low-income and moderate-income people who purchase
homes from the corporation.
   The agency plans to offer about 10,000 properties to low-income
people, of which 5,174 are in Texas, 968 in Oklahoma and 881 in
Louisiana. The Texas Housing Agency has offered to reserve up to
$140 million in low-cost mortgages to speed the purchase of homes
there.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Plummet On Brazilian Economic Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices fell sharply Friday on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange after Brazil's new president announced
sweeping economic reforms that were seen as likely to spur sales of
Brazilian coffee.
   The Brazilian economic package also was linked to a decline in
soybean futures prices and to a sharp rise in sugar futures,
although analysts conceded the measures were difficult to interpret.
   On other commodity markets, grain futures rose; oil futures were
mostly lower; precious metals advanced and livestock and meat
futures were mostly higher.
   Coffee futures settled 5 cents to 6 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at 89.50 cents a pound.
   The economic reforms outlined Friday by President Fernando
Collor de Mello included abolishment of the Brazilian Coffee
Institute, introduction of a new currency with free-floating
foreign exchange rates and limits on bank withdrawals, all of which
were seen as encouraging Brazilian producers and exporters to pour
more coffee onto the world market.
   Brazil, the largest coffee producer, has been withholding coffee
from the market, which recently helped to boost coffee futures
prices to their highest levels in eight months.
   Analysts said the Brazilian Coffee Institute, which administers
the government's export and internal marketing policies, is known
to be holding a large quantity of low-quality coffee, possibly as
many as 17 million 132-pound bags.
   By dissolving the institute as a cost-cutting measure, the
government could force the agency to sell that coffee sooner that
it would have otherwise, although the beans would probably go for
internal consumption rather than export, said analyst Celeste
Georkakis of Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   A free-floating Brazilian currency could encourage Brazilian
exporters to offer more coffee on the world market, analysts said.
   They said limits on bank withdrawals might prompt producers and
exporters to sell coffee at lower prices as a way of raising cash.
   Analyst Arthur Stevenson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said that increased coffee sales was only one possible
interpretation of the Brazilian reform package.
   He said the selloff in coffee futures also reflected
disappointment about what Collor de Mello did not say.
   ``The market was perhaps looking for a very constructive
statement from the new Brazilian government and that statement was
not forthcoming,'' Stevenson said.
   Concerns about the new Brazilian currency also prompted selling
of soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade. Brazil is the
second-largest producer of soybeans after the United States.
   Soybeans settled 4{ cents lower to 1 cent higher with March at
$5.81} a bushel; wheat futures were 1{ cents lower to 5 cents
higher with March at $3.89{ a bushel; corn futures were { cent to
1{ cents higher with March at $2.47} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents
to 2 cents higher with March at $1.46 a bushel.
   Sugar futures surged in New York on the Brazilian news amid
expectations that the government would curtail sugar exports and
divert more of Brazil's sugar cane to the country's extensive fuel
alcohol program.
   Sugar futures settled .19 cent to .39 cent higher with May at
16.13 cents a pound.
   Petroleum futures finished mostly lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid profit-taking. Many traders refrained from
buying or selling while the monitoring committee of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries met in Brussels,
Belgium.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents lower to 1
cent higher with April at $20.07 a barrel; heating oil was .52 cent
to .84 cent lower with April at 54.46 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .40 cent to 1.37 cents lower with April at 56.96 cents
a gallon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures ended $1.20 to
$1.40 higher with April at $400.90 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2
cents to 1.4 cents higher with March at $5.093 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange ahead of the Agriculture Department's monthly
cattle-on-feed report.
   The report, which was released after the close, showed 5 percent
more cattle on feedlots as of March 1 than on the same date a year
ago.
   The figure was close to market expectations and was expected to
have little impact on futures prices.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .23 cent higher with
April at 77.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent lower to
.13 cent higher with March at 82.72 cents a pound; hog futures were
unchanged to .72 cent higher with April at 53.42 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .70 cent higher with
March at 50.55 cents a pound.

   Petroleum futures prices finished mostly lower
in moderate trading Friday, reflecting seasonal demand weakness.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for West
Texas Intermediate, which rose 33 cents in Thursday's session, fell
31 cents a barrel to $20.07. WTI is the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil.
   All other crude oil contracts for 1990 delivery also ended
lower, while 1991 futures finished slightly higher.
   Among refined products, the April contract for unleaded gasoline
dropped 0.98 cent to 56.96 cents a gallon. May gasoline fell 1.37
cents to 61.57 cents and June lost 0.88 cent to 61.77 cents a
gallon.
   No. 2 heating oil for April delivery fell 0.52 cent to 54.46
cents a gallon, May lost 0.54 cent to 52.89 cents and June dropped
to 52.32 cents, down 0.63 cent.
   Analysts said demand for crude oil has weakened in recent weeks
due mainly to seasonal factors including warmer weather nationwide
and spring maintenance when refineries use less crude oil to make
gasoline and other products.
   ``As of last week, the 13-week average demand was down 1 percent
from the same period last year,'' said Peter Beutel, energy analyst
with Elders Futures Inc.
   Slower demand has resulted in a sharp buildup in crude oil
inventories in the nation's storage tanks. Supplies are running
approximately 5.6 percent higher than last year, according to
statistics released this week.
   ``We will see demand pick up later this year but for now there's
plenty of oil out there,'' Beutel said.

   The stock market climbed sharply to a two-month
high Friday, turning the quarterly ``triple witching hour'' to its
favor in a busy session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 45.50 to
2,741.22, its highest close since it stood at 2,760.67 on Jan. 11.
   The average's gain for the week amounted to 57.89 points, on top
of a 119-point rise over the two previous weeks.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in the
daily tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 884 up,
591 down and 481 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 222.52 million
shares, up from 144.41 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 256.66 million shares.
   Blue chip stocks attracted buy orders at the witching hour,
marking the last trading in a set of options and futures on stock
indexes used by professionals in computerized index arbitrage.
   Reports from the trading floor of the NYSE showed imbalances
toward the buy side on numerous big-name stocks at the opening of
trading and again in the last half hour.
   The market's response was less clear, however, to word that the
producer price of finished goods was unchanged in February after
climbing 1.8 percent the month before.
   The apparent dropoff in inflationary pressures, which had been
widely forecast, was attributed primarily to a decline in energy
prices.
   Brokers said the data, excluding often-volatile food and energy
prices, still suggested a worrisome degree of underlying inflation.
   Norton Co., subject of a $75-a-share bid by BTR PLC, shot up 16|
to 74~ in heavy trading.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Exxon, up | at 47{; Philip
Morris, up | at 38|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up } at 41~;
DuPont, up { at 39&rsqb;, and International Business Machines, up 1| at
108|.
   An exception was Federal National Mortgage, down \ at 35~.
Company data showed a flat showing in February for one basic
measure of its profitability.
   Apple Computer jumped 3{ to 40\ as one of the volume leaders in
the over-the-counter market. Late Thursday the company said its
sales and earnings for the quarter that ends March 30 will be
stronger than expected.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $29.19 billion, or
0.89 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.72 to 187.92.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 5.16 to 396.40, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.84 at 341.91.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
4.10 to 442.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 364.18, up 1.91.

   Bond prices shot up Friday as traders detected
weakness in the nation's manufacturing sector and signs that the
economy remains sluggish and inflation in check.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 13-16 point, or
$8.13 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices
fall, fell to about 8.54 percent from 8.61 percent late Thursday.
   The government released three reports on February economic
statistics. But analysts said figures showing of no change in
wholesale prices and a 7 percent decline in housing starts during
the month had little effect because of the influence of
unseasonable weather.
   Instead, bond prices climbed after the Federal Reserve said
industrial production rose 0.6 percent, less than economists had
anticipated and largely due to a return of automobile workers after
January slowdowns.
   ``The factory sector of the economy remains weak,'' said Steven
A. Wood, economist with BankAmerica Capital Markets in San
Francisco.
   Analysts had expected an increase in industrial production of
0.8 percent to 0.9 percent, Wood said, so the lower figure was
interpreted as a further sign of weakness. Factoring in resurgent
auto production, the signs were even weaker, he said.
   ``What you had in the markets was expectations for worse news on
the price front and the economic front,'' which strengthened the
credit market, said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, president of Ramirez
Capital Consultants Inc.
   The industrial production report was good for the bond market
because a slowdown in such economic indicators dampens the
likelihood the Fed will think it necessary to raise interest rates
in order to curb inflation. Higher interest rates lower the value
of existing bonds.
   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index showed no change
following a huge 1.8 percent jump in January attributed to a
holiday cold snap. Mild weather in February kept energy prices down.
   Economists said inflation, which erodes the value of bonds,
still was on a 4 percent to 4.5 percent annual course.
   Also, housing starts returned to a more normal pace in February,
declining 7.0 percent following a steep jump during January's
record warm weather.
   Analysts said both reports virtually were ignored by bond
traders as they were in line with expectations.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments gained &lsqb; point to \ point, intermediate maturities were
up 11-32 point to { point and long-term issues shot up 23-32 point
to 13-16 point, according to Telerate Inc., the financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, climbed 4.25 to 1,151.81.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.15 percent as the
discount was down 2 basis points to 7.90 percent. Yields on
six-month bills dropped to 8.26 percent as the discount was 2 basis
points lower at 7.85 percent. Yields on one-year bills were off
sharply at 8.34 percent as the discount lost 5 basis points to 7.75
percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16 percent, down from
8\ percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 91 15-32, up 3-32 point. The
average yield to maturity was 7.49 percent, compared with 7.48
percent late Thursday. The Bond Buyer changed the mix of bonds in
the index on Friday.

   OPEC oil ministers met Friday evening to
review the group's pricing and production strategy and decide
whether to change it in the coming months.
   The meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries' special monitoring panel got under way amid widespread
speculation that the cartel was unlikely to rein in current
production anytime soon despite slackening demand and softer world
oil prices.
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said demand for the group's oil
is expected to fall to 20.8 million barrels a day in coming months,
far below the 23.7 million barrels the cartel is estimated to be
pumping.
   The ministers met for about 90 minutes in formal session then
adjourned. The committee was expected to hold informal discussions
in their hotel rooms on Saturday.
   No date was set for a final session but many doubt the
discussions will continue beyond the weekend.
   In advance of the session, some ministers expressed concern that
quota-cheating by various OPEC members, which has swelled the
cartel's production well above its target, could dampen prices
further.
   Prices have been slipping since early January, and are expected
to weaken further in the traditionally weak second quarter when
seasonal factors and annual refinery maintenance reduces demand for
crude oil.
   ``Those countries that overproduce, I think, they have some
explanations. Surely they have some reasons behind it,'' said
Ginandjar Kartasasmita, oil minister of Indonesia.
   ``We would like to hear it,'' he said.
   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, reflecting the unease
about the upcoming quarter, said, ``It has three months _ April,
May and June. I wish it had two.''
   The opening of the committee meeting was delayed several hours
to give the ministers time to huddle privately in their suites at a
luxury hotel not far from OPEC headquarters.
   Several ministers said no changes would be made in the cartel's
production and pricing guidelines for the first half of the year.
   ``We are not suppose to take any decisions,'' said Ginandjar.
   Nigerian Oil Minister Jibril Aminu said the purpose of the
meeting is to monitor production and quotas.
   ``What decision is taken depends on the data available to us,''
he said.
   Some were clearly worried by the cheating of such countries as
Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   Mana Saeed Otaiba, the Emirates' oil minister, told reporters he
would like to see both higher production and higher prices but
acknowledged, ``That is impossible.''
   When pressed to make a choice, he said, ``We'd rather increase
production until everybody is satisfied.''
   Industry analysts put OPEC's output at well over 23 million
barrels a day. Its supply ceiling for the January-June period is a
bit more than 22 million barrels a day, compared with 20.5 million
barrels in the last quarter of 1989.
   Until recently, demand in the United States and other consuming
nations has dried up the excess supply, keeping prices above the
cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.
   But some worry that continued high production will lead to
weaker prices in the April-June quarter when demand tends to shrink
with warming weather.
   ``(Overproduction) is a concern to us,'' said Ginandjar.
   Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, upon arrival late
Thursday, said, ``We knew from the beginning the second quarter
will be difficult.''
   Iraq's minister, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, said demand
``will go down'' in the April-June quarter _ ``that's for sure.''
He predicted it would run between 21 million to 22 million barrels
a day.
   In order to keep prices up, he said, ``we will ask everybody to
adhere to the quota, and I think this will be met.''
   ``Prices are ... not as firm as they used to be a few weeks ago.
... So maybe they (the overproducers) will think twice (about
raising output),'' he said.
   The average price of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC
was $18.36 a barrel in the first week of March. It hit $20.56 a
barrel in the first week of January.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark American crude, has been
trading in the range of $20 to $21 a barrel.
   In advance of the committee meeting, Chalabi reportedly pressed
_ although unsuccessfully _ for a 10 percent increase in the $18
reference price.
   His suggestion _ like that of Kuwait's Ali Khalifa al-Sabah to
scrap the quota system _ will likely get an airing at the committee
meeting. The talks are designed to lay the groundwork for a
decision-making conference in May.
   Sabah has said the quota system should be shelved because it is
unrealistic and often ignored.
   The cartel sets an overall output ceiling and then gives each
country a quota for its production. Without a quota, each member
could produce freely. But some of the countries now are producing
at their limits and could not go any higher.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>To Plead Guilty in Florida Home-Buying Scam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   General Development Corp. has agreed to plead
guilty to a felony charge and pay up to $500,000 in fines to settle
charges it schemed to inflate home prices at its nine Florida
developments, prosecutors said Friday.
   A 16-count indictment said thousands of home buyers lured by
slick sales pitches and Florida sunshine fell prey to an elaborate
scheme in which General Development allegedly made $850 million on
more than 11,000 overpriced homes.
   The indictment said the homes were sold mostly to Midwest and
Northeast residents, many of them recent emigrants brought to
Florida on sales junkets and blocked from learning the facts about
the state housing market.
   Many of the homes sold by General Development in nine
communities between 1982 and 1989 were at least 20 percent
overvalued compared to similar Florida homes, and at least one was
listed for more than twice its estimated worth, officials said.
   ``People's lives were devastated. ... They were stuck with
mortgage payments and homes valued far under what they paid,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Norman Moscowitz, who led the two-year
investigation.
   Federal prosecutors said General Development agreed to plead
guilty to one count of mail fraud and pay the fine as part of a
consent decree that must receive court approval.
   Also, the homebuilder agreed to reorganize top management and
set up a court-monitored restitution fund that could exceed $100
million during the next 25 years.
   Two former General Development executives named in the fraud
indictment are considering a plea agreement that would call for
some jail time, but the details have not been finalized, U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said.
   Former chairman David Brown and former president Robert Ehrling
were making $600,000 a year each before being forced out by General
Development directors March 9. They could not be reached for
comment Friday.
   Meanwhile, the New York investment firm United Capital Corp.,
which owns 12.7 percent of General Development, announced it plans
to nominate six candidates to the company's board at elections in
May.
   General Development, which also faces several class-action
suits, has restructured its home-sale policies and plans to remain
in business, said Charles Simons, president and chief executive
officer.
   ``It is clear that our house prices had gotten out of line with
our competition and that some customers were disadvantaged,'' he
said.
   General Development, whose nationwide real estate holdings equal
nearly half the size of Rhode Island, this month has laid off about
5,500 workers, about 10 percent of its work force, and shut down
sales offices in Hollywood, Fla., and Boston.
   In addition to 350,000 lots in the nine Florida developments,
General Development operates a time-share resort near Disney World,
a recreational community in Tennessee and 10 time-share resorts in
the West.
   Through dozens of northern sales offices and seminars, General
Development pitched vacant lots or built homes. Only other General
Development homes were used in appraisals to back up company
statements on the value of the properties, the indictment alleged.
   Many customers took advantage of three-day ``Southward Ho!''
subsidized trips to Florida.
   But General Development kept potential buyers from learning
about prices in other developments by assigning a sales
representative to track customers constantly and screen telephone
calls their hotel rooms, the indictment alleged.
   Those agreeing to buy a house were told to seek a mortgage at
GDV Financial Corp., a General Development subsidiary also named in
the indictment. General Development sales officials told buyers
that only cash and GDV mortgages were accepted as part of the
company's ``one-stop shopping.''
   Chase Federal Savings and Loan and California Federal Savings
and Loan, two major purchasers of GDV mortgages, stopped investing
after learning of the overvalued homes. Since 1988, GDV sold $70
million in mortgages to the public through Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. and PaineWebber Inc.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. also stopped buying GDV mortgages in 1985
because of the company's appraisal policies.

   A federal judge on Friday ordered Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. to give creditors more information about $260
million in bonuses paid before the firm filed for bankruptcy
protection.
   Lawyers for Drexel agreed to provide detailed information about
the firm's 1989 compensation and bonus payments over the weekend to
attorneys and accountants for the official committee of unsecured
creditors.
   Drexel also said it would turn over transcripts of depositions
of Drexel executives taken by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which is investigating the bonus payments.
   Creditors have questioned the timing of the bonus payments of
$196 million in cash and $64 million in securities to Drexel
exceutives in the months prior to the firm's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing on Feb. 13.
   SEC Chairman Richard Breeden told Congress on March 2 the
commission was investigating whether there was any was wrongdoing
in the bonus payments, which Drexel said were made in December and
January.
   Under federal law, creditors can seek to recover payments made
to company insiders up to one year before a bankruptcy filing.
Creditors routinely seek a wide range of information about a
company's financial condition leading up to a filing.
   After Drexel creditors attorney Marc Kirscher said the company
was trying to impede a study of the firm's financial condition
before the Chapter 11 filing, Drexel agreed to turn over copies of
financial statements and auditors' reports for 1988. A Drexel
spokesman said 1989 reports were not yet completed.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III said if the
creditors committee was not satisfied with information provided by
Drexel it could raise complaints at a hearing Monday.
   Drexel had asked that the information about the payments remain
confidential, but Buschman said it would become public in court or
through the SEC.
   The bonus payments were made by Drexel's securities subsidiary,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which is not part of the bankruptcy
case. But creditors can seek information about the payments because
they relate to the financial status of the parent firm.
   Also Friday, Drexel also disclosed in court that it hoped to
sell its $65 million investment in Paramount Petroleum Corp. for
$9.5 million. Drexel owns 53 percent of the company, which is in
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Buschman also resolved the first challenge by creditors to a
planned asset sale when he allowed Drexel to accept an offer for
nearly $10 million for $14.1 million in high-yield notes issued by
Petco, a California pet supply company.
   Drexel underwrote the 15.5 percent notes due in March 1991 in a
private placement. Creditors had wanted to Drexel to consider other
bids to try to get a higher price.
   Drexel, once one of the most powerful firms on Wall Street,
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after defaulting on
short-term debt and failing to raise new bank credit.
   Under an agreement between the company and creditors, three
Drexel board members are supervising the firm's liquidation with
input from creditors.

   Zenith Electronics Corp. said Friday it
had determined that Groupe Bull owes the company an additional
$49.5 million for Zenith's computer products business.
   The announcement is the latest development in a disagreement
that began last month over the French company's acquisition of
Zenith Data Systems.
   No one was immediately available for comment at Groupe Bull's
U.S. offices in Billerica, Mass., a woman in the company's public
relations office said.
   Zenith is disputing Bull's request for a $49 million refund on
its Dec. 28 payment of $496.4 million for Zenith Data Systems.
   A Groupe Bull spokesman at the company's U.S. office in
Billerica, Mass., took issue with Zenith's claim. ``The price was
based on net book value, and that's something that's subject to
business judgment,'' said the spokesman, who asked not to be named.
   ``Right now Zenith Electronics and Bull are proceding through
the stipulated process ...,'' the spokesman said. ``It's a
negotiating process.''
   On Friday, Zenith said it expected a further payment of $49.5
million as the final adjustment to the purchase price.
   ``Based on extensive reviews to date by its staff and outside
auditors, Zenith Electronics Corp. concluded today that Groupe Bull
owes an additional $49.5 million for Zenith's computer products
business,'' Zenith said in a statement.
   Zenith said that if in 30 days it is still in disagreement with
Groupe Bull over the sale price, the matter would be referred to an
arbitrating accounting firm.
   On another matter, Zenith said Thursday its development of
high-definition television will lower its profits for the next few
years.
   The project, undertaken in partnership with American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., will cost Zenith $10 million this year, president
and chairman Jerry K. Pearlman said.
