   Nicolae Franghili has not seen his hometown
just across the Prut River in 49 years, since the day his parents
and their six sons fled Stalin's terror when the Soviet Union
absorbed Moldavia.
   He said he will return once a week if Romania's revolution
against another tyrant, Nicolae Ceausescu, opens one of the
tightest borders in Eastern Europe.
   Opening the border is expected to be on the agenda Saturday when
the Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, meets with
officials of the interim government that took over when Ceausescu
was overthrown and executed last month.
   Romanians profess to have more serious problems than
reunification with what is now Soviet Moldavia, taken by Stalin in
1940, but rising ethnic consciousness on the Soviet side has made
Moldavia one of the Kremlin's many headaches.
   Much broader cultural and economic exchanges and a plan to open
the border to free travel are among issues Soviet officials have
discussed with the new Romanian government, Mikhail S. Platon, a
deputy premier of Moldavia, said in an interview this week in
Kishinev, the capital.
   Franghili, across the river, is eager.
   ``I'm just waiting,'' the gray-haired, 60-year-old construction
engineer said in an interview Tuesday at the dining table of his
small apartment in this Romanian border city of 300,000 people. ``I
want a passport, so I can go every Sunday.''
   His father, a teamster, received a grant of land from the
Soviets after they arrived in 1940 in what had been northern
Romania, and everything seemed fine at first.
   The Soviet government sent material for the residents to make
clothing _ the same flowered cloth for men and women alike,
Franghili recalled.
   He remembers how columns of Soviet soldiers with red banners
unfurled led tanks into his town, how positive feelings began
changing as Stalin deported ethnic Moldavians and replaced them
with politically more reliable Slavs.
   The family fled to western Romania when Germany and its allies
in Bucharest attacked the Soviet Union in 1941. In 1946, they hid
again to avoid being sent back to the victorious Soviet side as
Stalin demanded.
   Franghili has seen the Moldavian side of the border only once,
on a tour in 1979.
   Romanian tour guides refused to allow deviations from tbe
itinerary, even for the reunion of relatives who had not seen each
other for decades. Franghili could not travel to the river town of
Kagul, about 90 miles south on the Soviet side of the border.
   Such strictness has been standard on the border for 20 years.
After Ceausescu refused to take part in the Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Soviet Union severely restricted border
access.
   In recent years, Ceausescu's worry that his citizens would find
life better on the other side prompted Romania to limit travel.
   Ethnic Moldavians, who make up 64 percent of that Soviet
republic's 4.2 million people, began clamoring last year for more
autonomy from Moscow, as have people in the Baltic republics and
other regions.
   Like the Baltics, Moldavia was taken by Stalin under the secret
protocol of the 1939 non-aggression agreement with Nazi Germany.
   Until now, Moldavian activists had no options because Ceausescu
_ a ``Romanian Stalin'' in the eyes of Mikhai Ghimpuc, leader of
the Moldavian People's Front _ was on the other side of the border.
   Soviet officials, who for decades tried to convince the world
that Romanians and Moldavians were distinct nationalities, finally
gave up. In September, the Cyrillic alphabet Stalin imposed on
Moldavia was replaced by the Latin alphabet Romanians use.
   People on both sides of the border understand each other with
little difficulty and both areas claim to be cradles of Romanian
culture. For centuries, Iasi was a center of Romanian learning.
   Ethnic feelings and passion for reunification are much stronger
on the Soviet side of the border than in Romania.
   Platon said that, when the uprising against Ceausescu began,
many Moldavians told the Soviet government they were ready to fight
for the revolution. Moscow refused to allow it, but offered
humanitarian aid.
   The Soviet side is willing to open bridges closed for decades,
exchange theater groups, writers and other artists, and begin
closer economic cooperation, Platon said, but reunification is
another question.
   ``This is not a situation of two Germany,'' he said, referring
to calls to reunify East and West Germany since the Berlin Wall was
opened in November.
   He said Soviet Moldavians, whose territory is rich
agriculturally, know they live better than Romanians.
   Officially, the new Romanian government agrees reunification
with Moldavia, or Bessarabia as it was known in the Russian Empire,
is not on the table.
   ``There is no Bessarabian problem, and in any case, it is not
Bessarabia, but Soviet Moldavia,'' said Silviu Brucan, who manages
foreign policy for the National Salvation Front now running Romania.
   Franghili and other residents of Iasi see reunification as a
distant goal, not to be pursued now when the country must be
rebuilt.

   U.S. military experts began excavating
two airplane crash sites in Laos today to determine the fates of
American servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said.
   The experts left Bangkok Friday for the seventh joint excavation
with Laotian officials since 1985, said spokesman James Williams.
   They were from the U.S. Joint Casualty Resolution Center and the
Army Central Identification Laboratory, both based in Hawaii and
charged with accounting for America's wartime missing.
   Williams said the current sites in southern Laos were surveyed
twice last year, but he had no further details.
   About 2,300 Americans are listed as missing in action from the
Vietnam War, about 540 in Laos.
   The war ended in 1975 with communist victories in Vietnam, Laos
and Cambodia. The United States has diplomatic relations only with
Laos.

   Five workers at a Hindu temple in
southern India were suspended pending an inquiry into the death of
the temple's 47-year-old elephant, according to news reports.
   The elephant Venugopalan died Tuesday after gangrene set in on
lesions on his legs caused by beatings, Press Trust of India said
Friday. It quoted unidentified official sources as saying the
elephant's handlers had hit him with heavy objects.
   Five temple workers, including the assistant administrator for
livestock, were suspended after veterinarians at the Kerala
Agriculture University at Trichur issued an autopsy report, the
news agency said.
   Venugopalan, whose name is derived from one of the names used
for the flute-playing Hindu warrior god Krishna, belonged to
Trichur's Guruvayoor temple, a major pilgrimage site in the
southern coastal state of Kerala.

   Hot ash and rocks shot from Mount Etna
and fell on nearby hamlets during a snowstorm, experts said.
   Seismologists at the International Volcanology Institute in
Catania, the Sicilian city lying at the foot of Europe's most
active volcano, also said a series of tremors rattled the top of
Mount Etna over several hours early Friday.
   The southeastern crater of the volcano spit hot ash and lava
rock, which fell on the villages of Maletto, Bronte and Randazzo
during a snowstorm, the seismologists said. No one was injured and
no damage was reported.
   Bad weather conditions did not allow volcanologists to observe
the eruption at close range, but they said it did not appear lava
had flowed down the side of the volcano.

   The new chief editor of Pacific Stars and Stripes
will be a uniformed officer despite recommendations by Congress
that a civilian hold the post at the newspaper, which serves
American troops.
   Today's edition said Marine Col. Walter S. de Forest will
replace Air Force Col. Edwin J. Montgomery as commander and
editor-in-chief when Montgomery retires in the spring.
   It said the appointment was reviewed by the Defense Department
and the ombudsman appointed last June to look into complaints that
military editors had censored news.
   Philip M. Foisie, the ombudsman, is a former executive editor of
the International Herald Tribune and former foreign editor of the
Washington Post.
   He visited Japan several times to look into the situation at
Pacific Stars and Stripes and traveled to West Germany to assess
its sister paper, European Stars and Stripes. His recommendations
on management of the papers have not been made public.
   A report in 1988 by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, said it found evidence of censorship
and improper management at the papers and recommended the top
editor at each be a civilian. Several members of Congress have said
American troops should be assured of receiving uncensored news.
   The military editors of the papers denied censorship.
   In October, Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said the
Pentagon would install civilians as chief editors when the current
editors retired. Later, he said no decision had been made.
   De Forest, the new editor of the Pacific edition, is deputy
director of public affairs for the Marine Corps in Washington and
has a masters degree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin.
   Pacific Stars and Stripes said he would serve an internship on
commercial newspapers in the United States before taking his new
job.
   Staffs of the service papers include military and civilian
journalists. Some civilians have said military commanders stop
publication of news that might embarrass the armed services or
offend host countries.

   Daniel Vernet, editor-in-chief of the daily Le

failed bid last month for the top post at France's most respected
journal.
   Vernet, 44, was the sole candidate on a ballot to succeed Andre
Fontaine as managing director of the independent afternoon
newspaper.
   Fontaine announced the appointment Friday and named two
editors-in-chief to assist Vernet in his new job. Bruno Frappat
will take charge of daily coverage and Claude Sales will handle
supplements, the debate page and long-range projects.
   An editorial staff panel of 250 chooses the paper's managing
director by vote. Vernet failed to muster the 60 percent approval
needed in the Dec. 18 vote.
   No other candidate has been put forward to succeed Fontaine,
whose term expires in 1993. Fontaine said Vernet's appointment to
the newly created post underscores his confidence in him.
   Vernet joined the newspaper in 1973 and served as a
correspondent in Bonn, Moscow and London before becoming foreign
editor in 1983 and editor-in-chief in 1985.

<HEAD>Keating Blasts Regulators for Taking Away Thrift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.,
denying government charges he plundered his own thrift, is
defiantly accusing the government of driving his Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association into bankruptcy.
   Keating, who is asking a federal court to overturn the
government's seizure of Lincoln, said the Irvine, Calif., thrift
would be operating at a profit today if the government hadn't
interfered in his business, eventually taking it away from him.
   ``They took away an association with $5.5 billion in assets and
they were supposed to have some reason to do that,'' Keating told
reporters Friday after completing nearly six hours of testimony
before U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin.
   ``This company (Lincoln) made money. In my opinion it was well
managed. In my opinion it would have survived. In my opinion there
would have been, under the proper handling by the regulator, no
losses,'' he said on the steps of the federal courthouse.
   Regulators seized Lincoln in April and estimated the cost of the
failure to taxpayers at up to $2 billion, making it the largest S&amp;L
failure yet. The government later filed a $1.1 billion fraud and
racketeering civil suit against Keating and his associates.
   The financier is also at the center of a political drama in
which the Senate ethics committee is investigating the actions of
five senators who accepted more than $1.3 million in contributions
from Keating and later met with federal regulators on his behalf.
   Under questioning from government attorneys and the judge,
Keating denied the contention of regulators that he used business
deals and other devices to funnel money from Lincoln to American
Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent company.
   The holding company paid Keating a total salary of $3.7 million
in 1986 and 1987 and employed many of his relatives.
   Specifically, the government says American Continental used a
tax-sharing agreement between Lincoln and American Continental to
siphon $94 million from the thrift to the holding company from 1985
through 1988.
   However, Keating told Sporkin, ``With all my heart and soul, I
want you to know that I categorically deny that I had any concept
remotely related to that.''
   Regulators say Keating used ``sham'' land transactions to
generate false profits at Lincoln, which in turn created a tax
liability that could be paid to the holding company.
   In one, Lincoln was able to make an $11 million profit and
create a $4.4 million tax liability by selling 1,000 acres of land
to WestContinental Mortgage Co., a straw buyer for Arizona
developer Ernest C. Garcia. That same day, Garcia had received a
$20 million loan from Lincoln which regulators contend enabled
Garcia to pay for the land.
   Keating acknowledged Lincoln's bookkeeping cloaked Garcia's
identity as the true buyer of the land, but he said that was common
in land syndication deals.
   Sporkin, who served as enforcement chief at the Securities and
Exchange Commission before becoming a judge, reacted skeptically.
   ``When you run a bank or a savings and loan, you have the
highest responsibility of anyone because you're not dealing just
with stockholders, you're dealing with people's savings,'' Sporkin
said. ``... The only way regulators (can ensure that an institution
is being run properly) is if the books and records accurately
reflect transactions.''
   Garcia, through his attorney, refused to testify Friday,
invoking his constitutional protection against self-incrimination.
   Friday marked the seventh day of hearings in Keating's attempt
to overturn the seizure of Lincoln and the end of the government's
presentation. Keating's attorney said he would require nine days to
present Keating's evidence against regulators. Sporkin said he
hoped to begin those sessions as early as next week.
   ``The government's case has been presented and completed and to
me it's obvious that they have not made a case. ... Our turn now
starts,'' Keating said.

   Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of President
Dwight Eisenhower, will marry Roald Z. Sagdeev, an adviser to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   They will tie the knot in a Feb. 9 civil ceremony in Moscow and
then will be ``blessed'' at a religious ceremony at the U.S.
Embassy there, Sagdeev said.
   The couple will maintain two homes, living in Washington with
Miss Eisenhower's three school-age children during the fall and
spring, and spending summers in Moscow, said Sagdeev, 57. He said
he has two grown children.
   They met 2{ years ago, and the romance blossomed while they
collaborated on a book about ``survival, how a very thin layer of
intellectuals survived through difficult years, through purges,''
before Gorbachev rose to power in 1985, Sagdeev said.
   Miss Eisenhower, 38, was not immediately available for comment
on the wedding, which she announced through the Eisenhower World
Affairs Institute. The marriage will be Miss Eisenhower's third.
Her consulting company, the Eisenhower Group Inc., handles
commercial ventures for major U.S. companies dealing with the
Soviet Union.
   Sagdeev, a rocket scientist, was elected to the Soviet Congress
of People's Deputies last year, and was a political ally of the
late Andrei D. Sakharov.

   Gwyneth Jones, who made her debut at the
Metropolitan Opera in 1972, hadn't sung the title role in
``Turandot'' here until the Puccini opera's first performance this
season.
   Her performance was a triumph.
   Her singing, including lots of difficult high notes, was strong
and beautiful. Vocally and in acting, the Welsh soprano made
Turandot more womanly and less a monster than usually is done.
   Since Calaf, the tenor, falls in love with the bloodthirsty
Chinese princess, it's probably a good idea.
   At the Friday night performance, Nello Santi conducted with
control and vigor and received enthusiastic applause.
   Vladimir Popov of Moscow has an unusual tenor voice. In the
first act it was focused too narrowly and sounded strained. After
he warmed up, it sounded like an Irish tenor, warm while keeping a
crisp edge. His voice can ring, not just on final notes, but
through entire phrases.
   The aria ``Nessun dorma'' is where most tenors display their
vocal beauty.
   Popov's voice sounded more beautiful when he was answering
Turandot's riddles _ if he missed she'd send him to death _ and
later, when Turandot is feeling emotion for the first time.
   Aprile Millo sang the slave, Liu. We prefer a less rich soprano
voice for Liu, as more of a contrast to Turandot's voice. But
there's no denying that Miss Millo created some beautiful musical
moments.
   Early in Act 1, however, when Liu, Calaf and his old father are
on stage, John Macurdy as the old man sounded best. The other two
were pushing too hard.
   The production, one of Franco Zeffirelli's elaborate, big ones,
was new in March 1987. It wasn't presented last season and much of
the audience hadn't seen it before, judging from the delighted
gasps for the emperor's splendid golden throne room.
   A few changes have been made.
   Act 1 is gray people, sampans and shacks. The palace, once
shimmering in the distance, seems to have been brought forward. And
the banners furled for each riddle now are done by three men
instead of the silliness of two men pulling them from a backpack
worn by Turandot.

   When Flight 1575 took off from Fresno, Calif.,
the passengers thought they were flying to Reno, Nev., but the
Federal Aviation Administration says the pilot and his dispatcher
had other plans.
   The FAA, which for a time thought the June 17 flight had been
hijacked, proposed Friday to suspend the licenses of the Delta Air
Lines pilot and dispatcher and fine the airline $70,000 for flying
an ``unairworthy'' plane to an unscheduled destination.
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said that when the airline found it
could not make needed repairs to its rudder control system in
Fresno or Reno, it allowed the plane to take off with passengers
and then immediately diverted it to Los Angeles where repair
facilities were available.
   Neither the FAA nor Delta identified the pilot or dispatcher or
said how many passengers were aboard the flight.
   Farrar said letters were sent Dec. 15 to the airline and the two
employees, informing them of the proposed fine and suspension and
giving them a chance to respond before it becomes final.
   Airline spokeswoman Jackie Pate in Atlanta said Delta would
investigate the incident and discuss the proposed action with the
FAA. ``It's premature to say anything about what happened,'' she
said.
   The FAA said the pilot was in contact with maintenance
facilities in Atlanta, Ga., where the dispatcher was located.
   Before takeoff, the pilot spent 20 or 30 minutes on the ground
performing various tests in an unsuccessful effort to fix the
problem, the FAA said.
   According to the agency's letter, the captain and dispatcher
then ``devised a course of action to takeoff the aircraft from
Fresno with a flight plan ... to Reno with no intent to fly to Reno
but instead on takeoff to immediately divert to Los Angeles because
of the mechanical discrepancy.''
   During the time on the ground, the pilot did not communicate
with the FAA control tower.
   ``This, together with the unexplained diversion of the flight
after takeoff, prompted the FAA to treat the flight as a possible
hijacking and give it special handling,'' Farrar said.
   The 727 has three rudder control units, including a standby, but
the FAA said the aircraft's minimum equipment list requires that
all three be operating prior to takeoff.
   An inoperative system could cause control problems under some
circumstances, such as landing in a crosswind or if there were an
engine failure during takeoff, Farrar said.

   Panamanians almost unanimously support the U.S.
invasion that toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, despite
casualties that personally touched nearly a quarter of the
population, a poll there has found.
   More than six in 10 of the 794 Panamanians polled expect the
invading U.S. troops to remain there for six months or longer, and
nearly eight in 10 said they want the soldiers to stay that long or
``as long as necessary.''
   The survey, consisting mostly of in-person interviews, was done
Tuesday through Thursday by CBS News and Belden &amp; Russonello, a
research firm based in Washington. Remote areas were excluded, but
results can be projected to about 75 percent of the population. The
poll has a four-point error margin.
   Interviewing was under way when Noriega surrendered to U.S.
forces Wednesday night to face charges in Miami of supporting
international drug trafficking. Eight in 10 favored his trial in
the United States.
   CBS pollster Kathleen A. Frankovic noted that the findings could
reflect a ``post Noriega-out-of-there euphoria'' among Panamanians.
Follow-up surveys could find whether the support for the invasion
is lasting or short-lived.
   As things are, 92 percent said Noriega's reign was mostly bad
for Panama, and even more said the Panamanian people couldn't have
ousted him alone. With Noriega out, 90 percent expect the situation
in Panama to improve.
   The U.S. invasion Dec. 20 won equally resounding support:
Ninety-two percent were in favor, with most of them approving
strongly.
   Eight in 10, moreover, believed the United States ``sincerely
cared about helping Panamanian democracy.'' Nearly as many said
they would have supported a U.S. invasion during a coup attempt by
Panamanian officers in October.
   Roughly three-quarters said U.S. troops used appropriate force
in the fighting, which lasted four days, leaving an estimated 600
people dead and thousands wounded. Surprisingly, 19 percent said
the invaders used too little force.
   The invasion's cost was high in any case. Fifteen percent said
they suffered some personal loss, loss of property or vandalism to
their home or business. Ten percent said the main wage-earner in
their home had lost his or her job since the invasion. Ten percent
said they had a good friend or relative killed, and 13 percent said
they had a friend or relative wounded.
   Despite the casualties, 87 percent said Noriega's ouster was
``worth the price.''
   Respondents gave strong favorable ratings to their new leaders,
and about three-quarters expected Panama to be truly ruled by the
civil government, rather than by the Panamanian military or the
United States. Still, 57 percent opposed allowing members of the
military under Noriega to join the new military.
   On the Panama Canal, 53 percent expected the United States to
want to renegotiate the treaty turning the canal over to the
Panamanian government in 1999. Most found that acceptable: Seventy
percent preferred having the canal run jointly by the United States
and Panama, instead of either one alone.
   As to Noriega, 71 percent called it ``completely unlikely'' that
he may return to power, and 16 percent called that ``not very
likely.''
   The pollsters sought to avoid bias by having interviews
conducted in Spanish by Panamanian interviewers who said they were
doing independent research for television news, without identifying
the network.
   About 70 interviews were conducted by telephone with residents
of the wealthier sections of Panama City; respondents elsewhere
were interviewed in person. Interviews were conducted in 158
randomly selected neighborhoods, excluding more rural communities,
the remote Bocas del Toro and Darien provinces and the Indian
reservation of San Blas.
   CBS News noted that its efforts were complicated by the
conditions under which the survey was conducted, with neighborhoods
under curfew and a strong military presence in the streets.

   After almost two years of legwork, police
got their lucky break in a serial-murder investigation when a
helicopter pilot circled once more around a park and found a
suspect and one of his alleged victims.
   The pilot followed Arthur Shawcross, a 44-year-old paroled
killer, to a nursing home where police questioned him Wednesday. A
day later, Shawcross was in jail, charged with killing eight women
and under investigation in the deaths of three others.
   ``We were just on a search, just going over an area that we had
covered previously,'' said state police Sgt. Ken R. Hundt, one of
two pilots of the helicopter. ``It was kind of like (we saw) the
vehicle first, and then the second time around we both saw the body.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it was just a matter of luck.''
   Rochester Police Chief Gordon F. Urlacher said Shawcross made
statements to authorities about the murders and told police where
to find three bodies, but he refused to say whether Shawcross
admitted to the crimes.
   A state police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Shawcross admitted to 11 of the murders.
   Shawcross pleaded innocent Friday to eight counts of
second-degree murder at his arraignment in Rochester City Court.
Judge John Manning Regan ordered him held without bail until a
preliminary hearing Wednesday. Each count carries a possible
penalty of 25 years to life in prison.
   A profile of the suspect began to emerge Friday from state
prison and parole officials, relatives and police who investigated
the 1972 slaying of 8-year-old Karen Hill. The Rochester girl was
strangled and sexually molested while visiting Watertown, 150 miles
to the northeast.
   Shawcross was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for that
slaying and served 15 years in prison.
   ``I thought he was a very dangerous person,'' said Charles S.
Kubinski, a retired Watertown police detective who investigated
that slaying. ``He was not mentally disturbed. He knew what he was
doing.''
   After his parole in 1987, Shawcross was moved by parole
officials from three communities because of opposition by local
residents. One of the communities was Delhi, a town of 3,500 people
about 120 miles northwest of New York City.
   ``I feel that if the people hadn't stood up and showed their
displeasure with the system, then we'd have had the problem
Rochester did,'' Delhi Police Chief Frank Harmer said. ``We dodged
a bullet.''
   Shawcross eventually settled in Rochester, finding a job making
salads in a restaurant.
   He appeared to be adapting well to life outside prison, said
Edward Elwin, executive director of the state Division of Parole.
   ``Superficially, he was making a good adjustment,'' Elwin said.
   But his mother, Mrs. Arthur Shawcross of Brownville, said her
son remained ``a sick person'' who never got over his experiences
in the Vietnam war.
   ``He never should have been let out,'' Mrs. Shawcross told the
Syracuse Herald-Journal. She said her son, whom she hadn't spoken
to in 17 years, was shot in action and ``saw things he shouldn't
have seen over there.''
   Police refused to discuss a motive for the slayings, but said
all of the victims were involved with drugs or prostitution.
   Evidence linking Shawcross to three more slayings will be
presented to grand juries, said Monroe County District Attorney
Howard R. Relin.
   The 11 deaths are among 16 unsolved slayings of Rochester area
women in the last two years. Relin and Urlacher said they don't
believe the remaining five killings are related to the 11 in the
present case.
   Even as Shawcross was being arraigned, more bodies were being
found.
   Police following directions they said Shawcross had given them
found a body in a densely overgrown area in the suburb of Greece
early Friday. They said they believed the body was that of Maria
Welch, 22, a Rochester woman missing since Nov. 6.

<HEAD>US Inter-Agency Group Looks At Captured Documents in Panama</HEAD>

   U.S. intelligence and law enforcement
officials hope tons of documents captured by the military in Panama
will yield information on possible double agents and on arms and
drug trafficking, an intelligence community source says.
   Eight people in Panama are working on what has been dubbed the
Document Control Branch, a special inter-agency group set up for
the task, said the source, who has first-hand information about the
group and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   It could take representatives from the military, the CIA, the
U.S. Customs Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the
State Department some six months sift through the material,
according to the source. Asked about the group, a State Department
official said: ``We have nothing for you on that.''
   The U.S. military took the documents from Panamanian government
offices in the days following the Dec. 20 invasion.
   The source indicated the law enforcement and intelligence
workers were based at a U.S. military installation in Panama. A
Pentagon spokesman said the Defense Department did ``not have any
information on that.''
   According to the source, some of the papers examined by the
group document arms trafficking by the former regime of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, including the channeling of weapons to guerrillas
fighting the government in Colombia.
   U.S. officials have long contended that Cuba exports
Soviet-supplied materiel to undermine democratic countries in the
region.
   The State Department says Cuba ships arms to El Salvador's
rebels. Havana provides the Sandinista government in Nicaragua with
most of its weaponry, and Nicaragua, in turn, has supplied Panama
with arms, American officials contend.
   In 1987, Noriega's former deputy, Roberto Diaz Herrera, told
reporters the Panamanian general shipped weapons to the Colombian
guerrillas.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. officials Wednesday, faces drug
trafficking charges in Miami. And the source said the Drug
Enforcement Administration is seeking additional information on
drug trafficking in the papers.
   In other areas of inquiry, the source said:
   _Customs is looking into possible illegal transfers of
technology and smuggling. American officials have contended that
goods otherwise unavailable to Cuba because of trade sanctions have
arrived on the island through Panama.
   _The CIA will be looking for lists of spies, attempting to find
out who may have worked as double agents. Noriega has been widely
reported to have established close ties with the CIA when he served
in the 1970s as head of intelligence for the Panamanian Defense
Forces.
   As his internal problems heated up and the Americans pressed for
his ouster, Noriega sought closer ties with Cuba. Several U.S.
sources believe the general often worked as a double agent,
providing information to the intelligence agencies in both the
United States and Cuba.
   A former Noriega aide, Jose I. Blandon, testified before a
Senate hearing in 1988 that the general began building up a
criminal organization in the early 1970s which involved money
laundering, drug smuggling and arms dealing.

<HEAD>North's Lawyers Says Reagan Should Have Been Questioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for former White House aide Oliver
North say his Iran-Contra case convictions should be thrown out
because former President Reagan did not testify at North's trial.
   ``Mr. Reagan was in a position to testify, as no other witness
available to North could,'' about whether the president authorized
a cover-up of a 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran, North said
in papers filed Friday urging a federal appeals court to overturn
his convictions.
   North testified at his trial last year that then-national
security adviser John Poindexter told North that Reagan in a Nov.
12, 1986 meeting had not disclosed to congressional leaders his
1985 authorization for the Hawk shipment.
   ``That statement by Poindexter certainly provided a reasonable
basis for concluding that Mr. Reagan had made clear that U.S.
involvement in the Hawk shipment should not be disclosed to
Congress,'' North's papers said.
   ``Mr. Reagan's expected testimony also would have corroborated''
North's statements that he was ordered to cover up evidence of his
assistance to the Contras by altering classified National Security
Council documents, the filing said.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell quashed North's
subpoena for Reagan's testimony, saying the court record contained
no proof the president authorized North to break the law.
   Court arguments in North's appeal are scheduled for Feb. 6. He
was convicted in May of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress in connection with the Hawk shipment, altering and
destroying National Security Council documents that detailed his
assistance to the Contras, and illegally accepting a home security
system from Richard Secord.
   Secord, enlisted by North to run arms to the Contras during a
congressional ban on military aid to the rebel force, will be
sentenced Jan. 24, it was disclosed Friday. Secord pleaded guilty
to making a false statement when he told congressional
investigators that he was unaware of any money from the Iran-Contra
operation that had benefited North. Secord could face up to five
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   North was sentenced to 1,200 hours of community service and
fined $150,000. He is appealing the fine and convictions while
serving the community service in an anti-drug program.

   A businessman faces up to 15 years in prison
and $500,000 in fines for attempting to illegally export military
gyroscopes to South Africa for use in anti-tank missiles.
   Frank Randazzo, 32, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court on
Friday to conspiracy and violating the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid
Act of 1986. The plea came two days after a South African admitted
he participated in the same plot to export sensitive military
equipment without a State Department license.
   Symone Morris Behrmann, a South African who had been living in
Toronto, Canada, pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to
conspiracy and violating the Arms Export Control Act.
   U.S. District Judge Joyce Green will sentence both men on April
20.
   Randazzo and Behrmann were accused with three others of
conspiring to ship $50 million worth of gyroscopes manufactured by
the Northrop Corp. to South Africa through Israel.
   Randazzo, Behrmann and the three others were indicted as part of
an ongoing U.S. Customs Service undercover operation designed to
stem the illegal export of sensitive U.S. technology.
   Also arrested and charged was Maryanne E. Callaghan, 39, of
Warwick, R.I. The other two who were charged, Perfezou and Lester
George Buckingham Talbot, are South African residents and have not
been arrested. The United States has no extradition treaty with
South Africa.

<HEAD>Researchers Identify Gene Possibly Linked to Colon Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say
their discovery of a gene that may play a role in forming colon
cancers could move science closer to a basic understanding of how
colon malignancies form.
   Dr. Bert Vogelstein, head of a research team at the Hopkins
oncology center, said his laboratory found that a gene on
chromosome 18 is ``an excellent candidate'' for one of four or five
genes that experts believe may be linked to colon cancer formation.
   The gene is called DCC, for ``deleted in colon cancer,'' because
the Hopkins research found it is altered in more than 70 percent of
the colorectal cancers studied.
   A report on the DCC gene was published Friday in the journal
Science.
   Vogelstein said the discovery had no immediate clinical or
preventative application for colon cancer, the nation's second most
lethal form of cancer. However, he said it could contribute to
developing methods to detect the disease at an earlier, more
treatable stage.
   The Hopkins team examined 41 colorectal cancers, finding that in
more than 70 percent of them the cells had only one copy of a part
of chromosome 18. The missing part contained what they called the
DCC gene. Normal cells have two copies of this portion of
chromosome 18.
   Normal cells contain 23 different and whole chromosomes, which
form the package for all human genes. The genes in a cell direct
the production of proteins that carry out biological functions,
including the creation of new cells.
   When these genes are altered, normal protein production is
affected. That can lead to abnormal cell formation and, perhaps,
disease.
   Though discovery of the DCC gene has no immediate application,
Vogelstein said it theoretically could lead to a method of early
detection of colon cancer. He said the mutated gene could produce
an altered protein that might be detected in blood or stool. That,
in turn, could lead to a direct molecular test for the early stages
of cancer formation.
   It is believed, he said, that colon cancer forms through the
mutation of four or five genes.
   Earlier studies at Hopkins identified two other genes, called
RAS and p53, that seem to mutate, or alter, during the formation of
colon cancer. RAS is an oncogene, a gene whose presence contributes
to cancer formation; p53 is a tumor suppressor whose absence seems
to enhance cancer formation.
   Vogelstein said the DCC gene ``is an excellent candidate'' for a
suppressor gene, but that the finding needs to be verified by other
labs.
   About 147,000 Americans were diagnosed with colon cancer in
1988, and about 61,000 die of the disease annually, second only to
lung cancer.
   Members of Vogelstein's research team included Eric Fearon, Dr.
Kathleen Cho, Janice Nigro, Dr. Jonathan Simons, Dr. J. Michael
Ruppert, Dr. Stan Hamilton, Antonette Preisigner and Kenneth
Kinzler.
   Science is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   A prosecutor accused of inventing a story
about two men trying to assassinate him was dejected because he
feared he wouldn't be reappointed, a top aide said.
   Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell, now in a psychiatric
hospital, hadn't gotten any indication on his future from the
state's governor-elect, the prosecutor's first assistant, Dennis G.
Wixted, said Friday.
   ``He was extremely disappointed at the prospect of not being
reappointed and was sometimes very sad, quiet and seemingly
depressed about it,'' Wixted said.
   The gun-toting prosecutor, known for accompanying detectives on
drug busts, resigned and checked into a psychiatric hospital after
he was caught fabricating the story, state Attorney General Peter
N. Perretti said Friday.
   Asbell, 46, had claimed that two gunmen opened fire on him
during a car chase through the streets of Camden on New Year's Day.
He said he was showered with glass from his shattered car windows
but wasn't badly injured in an attack he attributed to his tough
stance on illegal drugs.
   Asbell said he fired back with a 12-gauge shotgun and pistol he
kept in the car, and that he hit one of the assailants.
   ``I saw his head explode,'' Asbell said at a news conference
Tuesday.
   State police had found Asbell shot out his own windows, Perretti
said.
   ``The event was staged by Prosecutor Asbell, apparently acting
alone,'' Perretti said.
   He said Asbell could face criminal charges depending on his
psychiatric evaluation.
   Perretti refused to say why Asbell might have staged the
shooting.
   Wixted said Friday that his boss, whom Republican Gov. Thomas H.
Kean appointed in 1984, had despaired because he had no indication
he would be reappointed by Gov.-elect James Florio, a Democrat who
takes office Jan. 16. Asbell's term expired Dec. 17 and he had been
a holdover since.
   ``What developed was that his love for the job ... basically
forced him into a situation very difficult to describe,'' Wixted
said.
   Attempts to reach Asbell were unsuccessful Friday. Perretti said
Asbell entered the Carrier Foundation in Somerset County for
psychiatric evaluation; a spokeswoman there said privacy laws
barred her from confirming or denying his admission there.
   Perretti said if Asbell decided to check out of the hospital,
authorities could move to have him held involuntarily.
   The attorney general added that he hadn't found any evidence
Asbell's ``sudden and aberrational behavior'' affected his work as
prosecutor.
   Asbell stuck to his story as late as Thursday.
   ``I have met with the attorney general, and he made it
explicitly clear to me that I am a victim ... of a violent crime.
He very kindly said I have to get (in) my mind the fact that I am
not a prosecutor in this matter, but I am a victim,'' Asbell said
at a news conference.
   While in private practice in 1970, Asbell was shot in the chest
while representing a client whose property was put up for sheriff's
sale. The bullet remains lodged in his chest.
   ``I'm a hands-on prosecutor,'' Asbell said Wednesday. ``The
public knows me. If they know me, the drug dealers know me.''
   Kean said that if Asbell is found mentally incompetent,
``prosecution would not serve any purpose.''
   ``The whole situation is very sad,'' Kean said. ``He was a good,
hard-working prosecutor in every way.''
   Gloucester County Prosecutor Richard Hickey III said he
considered Asbell a close friend.
   ``He loved what he was doing. I really feel for his family right
now,'' Hickey said.

<HEAD>Bush Fears Use of Split Screen Made Him Appear Callous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has expressed concern that
networks' use of a split screen to show coffins of GIs being taken
off a transport plane just as the president was making lighthearted
comments at the White House made him appear callous.
   Bush, at the end of a news conference Friday, asked the
television networks to warn him in the future when use of the
split-screen technique is anticipated.
   The president was referring to the live telecasts of his
previous news conference, held Dec. 21, just one day after the
Panama operation began. Toward the end of that session, Bush
engaged in some holiday banter, unaware that most of the TV control
rooms also were splicing in a live shot of the solemn arrival
ceremony at Dover AFB, Del., for the bodies of the first U.S.
combat victims in Panama.
   All the networks except NBC employed the technique.
   ``I got a lot of mail. ... I had some calls,'' said Bush,
``because when I was speaking here in this room, juxtaposed against
my frivolous comments at the time were some split screen techniques
that showed American lives, the bodies of dead soldiers in their
caskets, dead soldiers coming home.
   ``And all I respectfully request is that if the urgency of the
moment is such that that technique is going to be used, if I could
be told about it, then we'll stop the proceedings. Or (not), if
it's something less traumatic.
   ``But that one _ I could understand why the viewers were
concerned about this. They thought their president at a solemn
moment like that didn't give a damn.''
   ``And I do,'' bush added, his voice catching. ``I do. I feel it
so strongly. So please help me with that if you would.''
   ABC News spokesman Scott Richardson said ABC News President
Roone Arledge ``in essence agrees with what the president said.''
   ``He (Arledge) called the control room when it came up split
screen and asked them to go back to full frame,'' Richardson said.
``Peter Jennings was quite upset and explained at the end of the
news conference that the president had not known you were seeing
the bodies arrive.''
   CBS News President David Burke said in a statement that he
understood the president's ``sensitivity'' about the incident, but
that the network had planned live coverage of the arrival long
before Bush announced his news conference.
   ``It was our judgment that we had the responsibility to
broadcast live a brief portion of the arrival ceremony which
occurred simultaneous with the president's briefing,'' Burke said.
   NBC, which did not use the split screen, said in a statement
that it was not likely to develop a policy to alert the White House
of such plans.
   ``As a practical matter, it's not likely to happen in most cases
since these decisions are often made in a matter of minutes,'' the
network said.

<HEAD>President Releases Disaster Aid Funds for Earthquake, Hugo
Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has authorized the release of
$184.6 million in disaster aid to help with recovery from Hurricane
Hugo in September and the California earthquake in October.
   The White House said in a statement Friday that the money would
be used for school reconstruction, debris removal, transfer of
patients to Veterans Administration hospitals from damaged
facilities and repairing federal parks, forests, wildlife refuges
and medical facilities.
   It also will be used for forest fire prevention and
stabilization of historic properties.
   The Education Department will distribute $62.8 million for
school reconstruction and related costs in the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, South Carolina and North Carolina, the White House
said.
   It said the Veterans Affairs Department will distribute $56.8
million for construction and repair of its facilities and transfer
of patients.
   The money comes from a congressionally approved package that
Bush signed Oct. 26, allocating a total of $2.85 billion in
disaster relief for regions that suffered from Hurricane Hugo and
the Northern California quake.
   Of that money, Bush was left $250 million to spend as he saw fit
on unanticipated needs from both disasters.

<HEAD>Noriega Bounty May Go Unclaimed.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Administration officials say the $1 million
reward offered by President Bush for information leading to the
capture of deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega apparently will
go unclaimed, although a congressman believes the money should go
to the papal nuncio in Panama.
   The administration had offered the bounty on Dec. 21, a day
after the U.S. invasion of Panama and while Noriega was still at
large.
   ``We don't have any claimants for it at this time,'' said
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel on Friday. ``Nobody's
stepped forward and asked for it. And I don't anticipate anyone
will, in view of the circumstances'' of Noriega's surrender and
arrest.
   He said that under terms of the $1 million offer Bush put on
Noriega's head, ``if there were claimants, the attorney general and
the secretary of state would determine who would receive it and how
much.''
   Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., said Friday in a letter to
Bush that the papal nuncio in Panama, Monsignor Jose Sebastian
Laboa, deserved the reward because he persuaded Noriega to
surrender.
   But administration officials, who asked not to be identified,
said the Vatican probably wouldn't qualify for the reward because
its role in Noriega's surrender was an indirect one.
   Noriega was holed up in the Vatican embassy from Christmas Eve
until this past Wednesday when he surrendered to U.S. forces.

<HEAD>Justice Spent $224,000 in Futile Effort to Find Leak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department says it spent $224,000
on a futile attempt to identify the source of an unauthorized
disclosure of a preliminary criminal investigation involving Rep.
William H. Gray III.
   The department conducted a five-month investigation to determine
who leaked information that the FBI was investigating alleged
financial irregularities in Gray's congressional office.
   An initial CBS-TV story that Gray was the subject of the
preliminary investigation prompted a storm of accusations from
Democrats on Capitol Hill that the Republican-run Justice
Department was trying to smear the Pennsylvania Democrat with news
leaks.
   The department quickly took the unusual step of issuing a
statement that Gray was not a target and was cooperating with FBI
agents.
   The CBS story was particularly embarrassing for Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh because it was aired as Gray was seeking election
as House majority whip, a job he later won. Thornburgh ordered an
investigation of the unauthorized leak.
   The $224,000 included the salaries and travel expenses of 11 FBI
agents, as well as prosecutors and support personnel, said Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel on Friday.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Orders New Trial in Cigarette-Safety Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court threw out the
nation's first damage award in a smoker-death case and ordered a
new trial, leaving lawyers for both sides haggling over who emerged
the winner.
   The ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday
set the stage for new and expanded litigation against cigarette
manufacturers, anti-smoking forces claimed.
   The appeals court overturned a lower court's damage judgment,
which would have made Liggett Group Inc. pay the family of smoker
who died of cancer $400,000. The lower court found that Liggett _
which makes Chesterfield and L&amp;M cigarettes _ had advertised its
cigarettes as safe.
   Attorneys for three cigarette manufacturers claimed victory,
citing the reversal of the award, which restored their 35-year
no-loss record in such cases. But their opponents stressed a part
of the ruling in which the court reinstated broader claims that
weren't fully considered in the first trial.
   Rose Cipollone of Little Ferry, N.J., a smoker for 42 years,
originally filed the case against Liggett and two other cigarette
manufacturers, Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. Mrs. Cipollone
died of lung cancer at age 58 in 1984, but her husband, Antonio,
has carried on the case.
   ``Plaintiff's attorneys are back to square one after having
spent nearly six years and nearly $3 million in lawyer and legal
fees,'' said Josiah Murray, Liggett's general counsel.
   He said he was ``extremely gratified'' with the reversal, but
declined to comment further on the decision.
   Charles Wall, an attorney representing Philip Morris and
Lorillard, also was pleased with the court ruling.
   Cipollone was out of town and unavailable to comment, according
to his current wife, Dorothy. His lawyers said they had been unable
to reach him.
   Marc Edell, Cipollone's attorney, said the decision ``is a big
win for us'' because he can now seek damages from all three
companies.
   ``I'm looking forward to retrying the case,'' he said.
   The ruling said Cipollone has ``live claims'' against the three
companies on grounds they marketed the product knowing the risks of
cigarette smoking. The district court had barred Cipollone from
making such a claim.
   One law professor with ties to anti-smoking forces said the
court's ruling on that issue strengthens a plaintiff's ability to
seek judgment against the tobacco companies.
   Richard Daynard, a Northeastern University law professor who
heads a center supporting lawyers suing the tobacco industry, said
the opinion ``really put tobacco litigation back on the track,
where it was a couple of years ago.''
   ``That is far more important than getting the $400,000 reversed.
This makes the cases actually very easy to win,'' Daynard said.
   Cipollone's lower court victory was on his contention that the
tobacco companies promised through advertising that their products
were safe.
   The appeals court said District Court Judge H. Lee Sarokin erred
on that point, by preventing Liggett from trying to prove that Mrs.
Cipollone didn't believe the companies' advertisements in the first
place.
   The court said Cipollone could pursue other points denied in
District Court such as a general failure-to-warn claim.
   But the court said Cipollone could pursue the failure-to-warn
claim against Liggett because his wife smoked its cigarettes before
1965, when a federal law took effect requiring cigarette makers to
put health warnings on packages.

   Call it the luck of the Irish, but a
wine bottle tossed into waters off Cuba by an Irishman washed up in
the land of his ancestors.
   Michael McNamee and his wife, Judy, were on a ship celebrating
their 25th anniversary in August 1988 when they sealed a note in a
wine bottle and threw the bottle overboard.
   ``It was just a whim that we threw that dumb bottle overboard,''
Michael McNamee said Friday.
   The McNamees of Grand Forks said they received a letter in
October from an Irish man, Billy McCarthy, saying he had found the
bottle off the west coast of Ireland. They have written to McCarthy
but haven't heard back.
   Michael McNamee, a department store merchandising manager, found
it ironic that their note would navigate thousands of miles of
ocean and wind up on Irish shore.
   ``I thought the bottle might get to Cuba or Florida or somewhere
along the eastern seaboard. But Ireland? No chance,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Government Strips Noriega of Rank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new civilian government sealed
the ouster of strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega by stripping him of
his rank as general and firing him as chief of the Defense Forces.
   The papal nuncio, Monsignor Jose Sebastian Laboa, disputed
statements by an aide and denied Friday that he gave Noriega an
ultimatum to leave the Vatican mission, where the strongman had
been in refuge before he surrendered to U.S. troops Wednesday.
   The Cabinet issued a decree firing 39 military officers,
including Noriega's chiefs of staff at the time of the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion that deposed him and defeated his army.
   The government also promoted three former Defense Forces
officers President Guillermo Endara named to head Panama's new
public security force.
   Two of the officers had been jailed after participating in a
failed March 16, 1988, coup against Noriega and were freed by the
U.S. invasion. The third, Eduardo Herrera, was ambassador to Israel
when he took part in the coup and has been in exile in the United
States.
   U.S. officials have said all 16,000 members of the Defense
Forces are accounted for, but the commander of U.S. invasion forces
said Friday that about 200 die-hard Noriega loyalists remain at
large and are ``capable of disrupting activities.''
   ``Our first priority is to capture their leadership,'' Lt. Gen.
Carl Stiner told reporters at Howard Air Force Base. He indicated
they include members of the paramilitary Dignity Battalions Noriega
created and other holdouts.
   Stiner accompanied Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who left for Washington after a one-day visit.
   He said troops had captured six of the 18 commanders of the
Dignity Battalions, which took to the streets in defense of Noriega
when the invasion began.
   ``The last four we captured were turned in by the people,'' he
said. ``Otherwise, it is like a rabbit hunt. We go and flush them
out.''
   Laboa, who sheltered Noriega for 10 days before he surrendered
to U.S. troops and was taken to Florida to face drug charges,
denied he gave the strongman an ultimatum to force him to leave the
mission.
   ``He left of his own accord. The nuncio never told him to
leave,'' Laboa said in a telephone interview. ``There was no
threat. There is not a single basis for thinking that.''
   Letters Noriega wrote to Pope John Paul II, the nuncio and
others before he left show that ``he left of his own free will,''
Laboa said.
   During the days after Noriega took refuge in the mission Dec.
24, the Vatican said it would not force him out but was urging him
to leave on his own.
   Thursday night, the Rev. Javier Villanueva, who was assisting
Laboa during Noriega's stay, said: ``If he would not have given
himself up, the Panamanian government, not the U.S. government,
would have been invited to send in forces to take him out. We would
have lifted the diplomatic immunity.''
   Asked about the statement, Laboa said, ``I don't know how such
craziness could have come out.''
   Villanueva could not be reached for comment Friday night.
   The Chamber of Commerce, a staunch opponent of Noriega, reopened
its doors after being closed for a year and nearly destroyed in the
invasion fighting.
   Chamber of Commerce head Alfredo Maduro called for U.S. aid.
``For the real recovery of the country to take place, we will need
the help of our friends,'' he said.
   Damage from looting following the invasion is estimated at more
than $2 billion. There is no estimate of damage from bombing and
combat in the invasion and U.S. economic sanctions against the
Noriega regime.
   The White House said the 1991 U.S. budget had no aid money to
repair invasion-related damage to Panama.
   ``Undoubtedly there will be some international funds, some bank
loans and that sort of thing that would be involved, and at this
point we just can't say how any aid might be financed,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Powell said the number of U.S. troops in Panama will be reduced
to close to the pre-invasion level of 12,000 ``over the next few
weeks.'' About 14,000 troops participated in the assault.
   A U.S. survey said Panamanians overwhelmingly approve of the
U.S. invasion, even though nearly one in four had a relative or
good friend killed or wounded in the fighting.
   CBS News and Belden &amp; Russonello, a research firm based in
Washington, interviewed 794 Panamanian adults, most in person,
Tuesday through Thursday. Remote areas were excluded, but results
can be projected to about 75 percent of the population. The poll
has a 4-point error margin.
   Noriega was arraigned on drug charges Thursday in Miami and a
judge entered a plea of innocent on his behalf after he refused to
recognize the court's jurisdiction on grounds he is a political
prisoner.

<TEXT>
   Moammar Gadhafi said capitalism and
Western-style democracy could ravage reformist Eastern Europe, and
he invited Jews to leave Israel and settle in Libya.
   ``There is no place for capitalism, which is dictatorship based
on exploitation of basic human rights that are completely crushed
in Western Europe and the United States,'' Gadhafi said Friday,
referring to the democratic reforms that have swept the East bloc.
   He told a news conference that said if Eastern Europe adopts a
``Western European system with its multiparties and capitalism, I
warn you of unemployment and beggars, of inflation, crises and, in
the end, war.''
   Wearing a dark suit under a flowing brown cape, Gadhafi sat at a
chair with a low table in front of him and a globe of the world at
his side. There were none of his usual female bodyguards, only a
few men watching the news conference.
   At one point he waved a green handerkchief he had been holding
to call for order from the estimated 100 Arab and foreign
journalists invited to his headquarters at Bab Aziziya, just
outside the capital Tripoli.
   ``Eastern Europe must adopt the new socialism calling for
`partners not wage-earners' _ parties destroy the causes of
democracy and revolution, the future reality will be the
Jamahiriya,'' he said, expounding from his third series of
``universal'' writings, known as his green book.
   Written and published in the mid-70s, the green book calls for a
new economic and political system to replace capitalism and
communism in a Jamahiriya, or masses, that has people representing
themselves without parties or parliaments.
   ``The other thing is the question of Jews. Despite the fact that
I am an Arab, and I know Arabs are targets of Zionism, I admit the
Jews are oppressed in the world,'' Gadhafi said.
   ``This is a crime committed by Europe and the rest of the world,
with the exception of the Arabs, at least of Libya, which would
welcome them back.''
   Speaking calmly, Gadhafi accused Europe and the United States of
plotting to rid the world of Jews by placing them in ``Palestine,
the tomb of Jews, the mass oven for Jews. They (Jews) must leave
the oven before it gets too hot.''
   There had been no hint of the content of his news conference,
which some believed would address the revolution in Romania and
allegations of Libyans fighting alongside security forces loyal to
ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   However, Gadhafi made no reference to the allegations.
   Asked about Western economic sanctions against Libya, Gadhafi
said: ``We are not interested in the European siege. The companies
working here need Libyan money, they need Libyan oil.
   ``We put our conditions, not they; if they don't like them, they
can go to hell.''
   He said no progress has been made toward a settlement with
American oil companies that suspended operations Libya.
   ``There is no progress. We are ready to talk but there is
nothing new,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Residents of Noriega Drive and Noriega
Lane say they like the names of their streets just fine and don't
plan to surrender them.
   But they have been targets of some kidding since deposed
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega was brought to the United States
to stand trial on drug trafficking charges.
   The streets in this Florida Panhandle city were named for a
family of Noriegas that arrived here more than 200 years ago, but
many residents don't realize that.
   ``The other night I called Domino's Pizza and the girl taking my
order asked my address,'' said Reyn Voeltz, a 10-year resident on
Noriega Drive.
   ``When I told her, she yelled, `Noriega!' and asked, `Are you in
Panama?' I said, `No, that's the name of my street,' '' Voeltz
said. ``I then heard a guy in the background yell, `Don't deliver!
Don't deliver!' Then the girl said, `Don't worry about paying for
the pizza. If you are who I think you are, there is a $1 million
reward for you.' ''
   Glenn Griffith, another Noriega Drive resident, said he gets the
same kind of kidding.
   ``Whenever someone asks my address, and I tell them Noriega
Drive, their first reaction is laughter,'' Griffith said. ``And
then they say, `Oh, Manuel.' ''
   The streets really take their names from a pair of Josephs, a
father and son.
   The first Joseph Noriega arrived in 1781 when the Spanish won
the city back from the British in the Battle of Pensacola, said
Sandra Johnson, curator of the Pensacola Historical Museum.
   His son was born in 1788 and was one of the early brickmakers in
the area between 1810 and 1830, she said.
   The Noriegas received tracts of land from the Spanish crown near
Escambia Bay where Noriega Drive is situated.

   Lawyers for ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega say they aren't seeking a plea bargain and will
move ahead with plans to bombard a federal court with motions to
dismiss drug-trafficking charges.
   Meanwhile, Noriega remains hidden from the public eye,
reportedly in a subterranean room at the federal courthouse where
he has met several times with defense attorneys.
   ``A man who is innocent is not receptive to any plea bargain,''
defense laywer Steven Kollin said Friday after a two-hour
conference with Noriega. ``General Noriega is not guilty of these
charges and if we can find a jury of 12 people who will have an
open mind ... General Noriega will be acquitted.''
   Kollin said he has ``absolutely'' ruled out a plea bargain with
the government. Justice Department officials have been quoted in
published reports as saying they might be interested in striking a
deal in exchange for information about Latin American drug networks.
   Federal prosecutors also said they were gearing up for a trial.
   ``We are not seeking any kind of agreement of any sort,''
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said. ``We are preparing
for trial.''
   President Bush, who announced Friday that he is sending Vice
President Dan Quayle on a Latin American diplomatic mission in
hopes of repairing relations with those nations after the Panama
invasion, also denied that the administration was seeking a deal
with Noriega.
   Bush refused to rule out a plea bargain, however. He said
Noriega has the same right as any federal prisoner to seek a deal.
   Speculation on a plea bargain is linked to the possibility
Noriega's trial might expose embarrassing details of his longtime
connections with the CIA.
   Kollin promised to seek Noriega's CIA files.
   ``We're looking for the truth and the only way to get to the
truth is to get to those documents,'' he said.
   Frank Rubino, another of Noriega's attorneys, said a number of
motions are planned to challenge the U.S. District Court's
jurisdiction over the 51-year-old Noriega, who could be sentenced
to 145 years in prison and fined $1.1 million.
   Among the planned motions will be claims the case is politically
motivated and Noriega is a head of state subject to diplomatic
immunity, Rubino said. Other charges will be that the U.S. invasion
of Panama Dec. 20 violated international treaties, he said.
   Rubino said it could take nine months to prepare for trial.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops in Panama City Wednesday
night, is charged with taking $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn his nation into a way
station for the cocaine trade.
   Noriega was among 16 people indicted by a federal grand jury in
Miami in February 1988. Noriega and five others named in the
indictment have been arraigned.
   Federal officials refuse to divulge Noriega's whereabouts. But
U.S. marshals have assured the Miami-based defense team that
Noriega can be made available within an hour.
   ``His demeanor is fine,'' Rubino said. ``He's cheerful and very
relaxed.''
   During arraignment Thursday before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler, the judge entered a plea of innocent after Noriega
refused to answer to charges. Noriega was ordered held without bond.
   Noriega was spirited into the downtown Miami courthouse early
Thursday after arriving at Homestead Air Force Base aboard a C-130
plane. He surrendered to U.S. troops after 10 days inside the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   The capture of Noriega has led to an exodus of Panamanian exiles
returning to their homeland from South Florida. Also, FBI agents
have reportedly been sent to Panama to review bank records of
suspected American drug dealers, according to newspaper reports.
   Cuban activists in Miami, meanwhile, have begun distributing
3,000 postcards addressed to Noriega with the message, ``Fidel
Abandoned You,'' referring to Noriega's alleged close ties with
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

   The wife of ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega says he is a model family man who has been wrongly
charged with drug trafficking and unfairly portrayed by the U.S.
media.
   Felicidad Fiero Noriega said she would raise money for her
husband's legal defense ``cent by cent,'' according to the
interview in today's editions of El Diario-La Prensa, a
Spanish-language daily newspaper in New York City.
   Mrs. Noriega has taken refuge in the Cuban Embassy in Panama
City along with her three daughters and a 4-month-old
granddaughter, the newspaper said.
   She told the newspaper she didn't trust the U.S. legal system
and feared for ``the destiny of my husband,'' who was brought to
the state of Florida to face U.S. drug-trafficking charges.
   The wife of the ousted military ruler made the comments in a
telephone interview from Panama, a transcript of which was made
available to and translated by The Associated Press on Friday night.
   ``I hope that good will triumph over evil,'' Mrs. Noriega said,
referring to her husband's legal fight against the drug trafficking
charges.
   Mrs. Noriega said the new Panamenian government hasn't contacted
her and is unaware of her situation. She said she plans to stay in
Panama, where ``everyone knows I have done social work for the
needy.''
   She said her husband also worked to help Panama's poor.
   ``If the TV cameras had been more objective they would have
filmed the many toys and bags of food we kept in the garage that
were going to the needy,'' she told the newspaper.
   Of the voodoo altars and cocaine U.S. officials said were found
by American troops in her husband's residence, Mrs. Noriega said,
``It was all made up.''
   She said she kept in touch constantly with her husband after he
took refuge in the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve. Noriega eluded
U.S. troops after they invaded the country on Dec. 20, and took
refuge in the embassy.
   He surrendered Wednesday night and was flown to the United
States.
   ``Everyone here knows Manuel Antonio to be a model husband who
raised his children with love and respect,'' Mrs. Noriega said.
   Asked if she knew about reports that a mistress had talked
Noriega into giving himself up, Mrs. Noriega responded: ``I was not
aware of her, because he loves me so much.''
   According to the paper, Mrs. Noriega denied any knowledge of her
husband's relationship with the CIA and said the accusations that
her husband engaged in drug dealing are false.
   Mrs. Noriega told El Diario-La Prensa that she had talked with
her husband before he decided to leave the embassy and give himself
up. But she said she ``never asked him why he was giving up or what
his plans were.''
   According to the paper, Mrs. Noriega said she ``got used to not
asking questions, even in difficult times like these.''
   Asked about her husband's properties in Panama, Mrs. Noriega
said they owned three houses, two in the country and one in the
capital, ``just like the majority of the upper middle class in
Panama.''

<HEAD>2 Killed, 14 Towns Under Curfew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JAMMU, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paramilitary troops fired at Moslem
separatists violating a curfew in the northern state of
Jammu-Kashmir, killing at least two people, police said today.
   The two men, both Moslems, were killed when they defied a curfew
Friday in Srinagar, summer capital of the state along the Pakistani
frontier, a senior police officer in Jammu said.
   Srinagar is one of 14 Kashmiri towns under round-the-clock
curfews because of the continuing violence by Moslems who seek
independence from predominantly Hindu India or union with
overwhelmingly Moslem Pakistan.
   The latest town to be placed under curfew was Badgam, just
outside Srinagar. Curfew was imposed there on Friday night after
Moslem demonstrators stoned a police patrol, the Jammu police
officer said on condition of anonymity.
   Residents are under orders not to leave their homes during the
curfews, which authorities started imposing Thursday to prevent
celebrations of Kashmir Day on Friday.
   Kashmir Day marks the anniversary of a Jan. 5, 1949, resolution
passed by the United Nations that said residents of Kashmir should
determine their own future.
   All government offices and educational institutions were closed
Friday in the curfew areas, said the police officer in Jammu, the
state's winter capital.
   Kashmir, the western part of the state, is mostly Moslem, while
the eastern Jammu area is mostly Hindu.
   Moslems comprise 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people,
making it the only state in India with a Moslem majority.
Nationwide, Moslems account for about 12 percent of India's 880
million people, while Hindus make up about 80 percent.
   Kashmir is claimed by India and Pakistan, and the two countries
have fought three wars over the territory since gaining
independence from Britain in 1947.
   A cease-fire line monitored by the United Nations divides the
old state of Kashmir into Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   At least 10 people were killed in Indian-governed Kashmir last
month during violence sparked by demonstrations celebrating the
release of five jailed Moslem extremists in exchange for a
kidnapped Cabinet minister's daughter on Dec. 13.

   Ammunition sales would be banned for a week
before New Year's Day and the Fourth of July under proposals aimed
at stopping revelers from firing guns into the air to celebrate
those holidays.
   Plans offered Friday by Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilmen Joel
Wachs and Richard Alatorre also would provide rewards of up to $500
for tips leading to conviction of people illegally firing guns in
the city.
   ``We have a reign of terror when it comes to New Year's Eve,''
Wachs said.
   Six people were wounded by falling bullets in the city on New
Year's Eve and two men were wounded by police when confronted while
allegedly shooting. Police made 75 arrests and seized 134 weapons
citywide.
   Bradley said he was ``disgusted'' to discover some gun stores
stayed open late in order to supply last-minute bullet buyers.
   The mayor commended the Police Department for an aggressive
education campaign that appeared to reduce the amount of shooting
over New Year's but observed that many stores had long lines of
bullet buyers over the weekend.
   Police received 706 complaints about New Year's gunfire, a
decrease from the 1,249 incidents a year earlier. A falling bullet
killed a 13-year-old boy during New Year's gunfire three years ago.
No one was killed this year.
   Wachs said there may be some discussion on the length of the
bans but predicted differences will be ironed out and a law enacted
by the 15-member council.
   At Western Surplus, a southside general store that sells weapons
and ammunition, operator Al Campbell wondered whether the ordinance
would be effective.
   ``The ban may cause people to buy ammunition one week earlier,''
he said.

   The case of a nun kidnapped and tortured
in Guatemala has been ignored by investigators in that country and
the United States, Roman Catholic church leaders say.
   A group of Kentucky church officials called Friday for
investigations by both Guatemala and the U.S. State Department into
the Nov. 2 kidnapping of Sister Diana Ortiz.
   Ortiz has said in a sworn statement that three men kidnapped her
from a religious retreat, beat her and burned her with cigarettes
during a 30-hour ordeal. Ortiz, a native of Grants, N.M., is a
member of the Ursuline Sisters of Mount St. Joseph, a religious
community based near Owensboro.
   She has made no public appearances and granted no interviews
since she returned.
   ``Religious leaders from across Kentucky are calling on the
president of Guatemala to begin a formal investigation,'' said
Sister Mary Matthias, major superior of the Ursuline order in
Owensboro.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and Rep. Carroll Hubbard, D-Ky.,
have requested an investigation by the State Department into the
torture and abduction.
   The State Department said Wednesday in a letter to Hubbard that
the investigation is up to Guatemala.
   ``We hope that she will be able to assist in the investigation,
once she has recovered from her ordeal,'' wrote Janet G. Mullins,
assistant secretary for legislative affairs in the State Department.
   As in other cases of human rights abuses in Guatemala, the U.S.
Embassy lacks the authority to investigate, Mullins wrote.
   A spokesman for Hubbard said the congressman was unhappy with
the response and planned to talk with Secretary of State James
Baker.

<HEAD>Firestorm Over Order To Execute `Traitors' If U.S. Invades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Defense Ministry communique ordering
the execution of ``traitors'' in the event of a U.S. invasion has
sparked a war of words between supporters and opponents of the
leftist government.
   The six-page ``Special Communique'' issued following the Dec. 20
U.S. invasion of Panama announced actions to be taken by the armed
forces in case of a similar American military attack in Nicaragua.
   Point No. 3 says:
   ``At the start of the Yankee intervention, all permanent
military units, reserves, people's militias and
counterintelligence, in close cooperation with state security,
apply the plans of neutralizing, cutting off and executing all
recalcitrant traitors who openly or covertly have been encouraging
the Yankee intervention.''
   Luis Sanchez Sancho, spokesman for the 14-party National
Opposition Union running against the government in next month's
election, said the communique ``effectively calls for committing
murders against the Nicaraguan opposition, who are invariably
accused of being `traitors,' by the Sandinistas' ideological
criteria.''
   Danilo Lacayo, another Union spokesman, accused the Sandinistas
of ``encouraging aggression against political leaders and
justifying such an aggression by saying it is done to protect the
national sovereignty.''
   In an open letter published by La Prensa, the country's only
opposition newspaper, Nicaraguan Bar Association secretary Orlando
Castillo Sobalvarro said called the Dec. 27 communique an
``instigation to the crime of genocide.''
   On Friday, Adrian Meza Castellanos, a leading attorney responded
with a letter to the pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario,
calling bar members ``traitors.'' The letter also accused the bar
of ``asking the U.S. government to intervene in our country.''
   Mariano Fiallos, president of the Supreme Electoral Council
supervising the campaign for the Feb. 25 general elections, asked
the government for an explanation.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega's reply, in a letter published
by the Sandinista newspaper Barricada on Friday, said the
communique stated that it had ``absolutely nothing to do with the
electoral process.''
   It ``has to do exclusively with the legitimate, extraordinary
and exceptional measures that an eventual armed intervention would
force the Nicaraguan government to impose for the defense of the
motherland,'' the letter said.
   The defense minister's brother, President Daniel Ortega, is
seeking re-election; his main opponent is Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, candidate of the National Opposition Union and publisher
of La Prensa.
   Although Fiallos himself is a Sandinista party member, his
council's impartiality has met with the approval of a United
Nations and other foreign observer missions here to monitor the
electoral process.
   Iqbal Riza of Pakistan, head of the U.N. observer mission, also
expressed concern to Fiallos about the communique. ``He went to the
council to raise the issue,'' said his spokesman, Angelica Hunt.
   Nicaragua and the Sandinista government have been on edge since
the Panama invasion, with the military on ``maximum alert'' and
tanks rolling through Managua's streets amid gun emplacements.
   Then last week troops surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Managua
with tanks and armored cars in retaliation for U.S. troops
encircling the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in Panama City. U.S.
military officials said they took the action to prevent deposed
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega and his henchmen from seeking
asylum.
   The military cordon around the embassy in Managua was withdrawn,
but last weekend the Sandinistas expelled 20 American diplomats in
retaliation for an American military search of the Nicaraguan
ambassador's residence in the Panamanian capital.
   President Bush called the search a ``screw-up,'' and the State
Department said the Sandinistas were trying to shrink the U.S.
mission to prevent it from monitoring the electoral process.
   Ortega promised the elections in return for the demobilization
of the U.S.-backed Contras fighting the Sandinista government.
   On Thursday, President Ortega called for the ``immediate''
withdrawal of U.S. troops from Panama, saying their goal of
capturing Noriega had been achieved.

   Two nuns slain in Nicaragua should be
viewed as modern-day martyrs whose example can spur efforts for
peace, a Roman Catholic leader said at the funeral for one of the
victims.
   ``We feel a right to be angry at this senseless death, this loss
of innocent human life,'' Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weakland
told nearly 700 people attending Friday night's funeral for Sister
Maureen Courtney, 45.
   But the deaths also provide ``the rare privilege of being
witnesses to martyrs in our day, no less glorious than in the past.
We can associate ourselves with those who gave totally of
themselves for others,'' he said.
   ``If we are encouraged by their example ... to make this world a
place of peace and love through the mutual service we give to one
another, then senselessness will be turned into fullness of life,''
Weakland said.
   Sister Courtney, a Milwaukee native, and Sister Teresa Rosales,
24, of Nicaragua, both members of the Fond du Lac-based Sisters of
St. Agnes, were killed Monday when their vehicle was attacked by
assailants in northeastern Nicaragua.
   Auxiliary Bishop Pablo Schmitz of Bluefields, Nicaragua, a
native of Fond du Lac, and Sister Francisca Colomer, 24, of
Nicaragua were wounded in the attack. Sister Colomer, transported
to Fond du Lac, was reported in fair condition at St. Agnes
Hospital Friday night, being treated for multiple head wounds.
   Members of the Sisters of St. Agnes in Nicaragua said evidence
at the scene indicates the ambush was carried out by U.S.-backed
Contra rebels. The Marxist Nicaraguan government has blamed the
ambush on the Contras, although a spokesman for the rebels
Wednesday denied any involvement in the killings.
   Sister Courtney worked as a teacher in the United States before
becoming a missionary in Nicaragua in 1978, where she helped
establish clothing co-operatives and a medical center.
   About 20 Nicaraguan natives who have worked with the Sisters of
St. Agnes sang a Spanish hymn, ``Pescador de Hombres,'' or ``Fisher
of Men,'' and several prayers were said in Spanish.
   Burial was scheduled for today.
   Earlier Friday, nearly 300 friends and relatives attended a
memorial service at Sister Courtney's home church in Milwaukee.
They wept as a coffin draped in red roses was borne between two
rows of women parishoners.
   The Rev. Tom Wittliff said Sister Courtney was a victim whose
sacrifice would bring life to others.
   ``On that road in Nicaragua, whatever traps were set, whatever
shots were shot, the spirit of Christ was being continued,'' he
said. ``The world has enough of the military, it has enough clowns.
What the world needs now is people who will give.''

   Old Jess may just be more than legend.
   A skeleton wearing old shoes discovered in an underwater cave is
believed by many to be the remains of Jess Preston, the subject of
50-year-old lore in this north Florida town.
   While investigators have yet to confirm an identity, they
believe a tale of a man drowning in the spring may prove true,
Sheriff Tom Tramel said Thursday.
   Two divers in ``Old Jess Hole'' near the Sante Fe River found
the skeleton.
   Shoes found on the skeleton are about 50 years old, said
Columbia County sheirff's Lt. Jim Wells.
   Some residents say the man disappeared near the spot where the
skeleton was found. His coat was found nearby, and relatives and
friends held a funeral service by the deep spring.
   Investigators are awaiting a report from forensic anthropologist
William Maples. A preliminary report indicated the skeleton was
that of a white male 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-8 who may have suffered
from Down's snydrome or a related disease.

<HEAD>13 Charged In Death of Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor investigating the deaths
of a five members of a family found buried under a muddy barn floor
says the killings may have been human sacrifices. A grand jury
indicted 13 people in the slayings.
   The grand jury, returning the indictments late Friday in
Painesville, charged reputed religious cult leader Jeffrey
Lundgren, his wife, son and 10 members of his group in the deaths
of the family.
   Lake County Prosecutor Steven C. LaTourette said those indicted
``are not crazy. They are the coolest, most inhuman people this
county has ever seen. They're going to die in the electric chair
for these crimes.''
   The five dead are believed to be Dennis Avery, 49; his wife,
Cheryl, 42; and their three daughters, Trina, 15; Rebecca, 13; and
Karen, 7.
   The Averys, found Wednesday and Thursday at Lundgren's Kirtland
farm, apparently were killed because of Lundgren's religious
concept and a prophecy, LaTourette said.
   ``Originally, this prophecy was that 10 of them had to die,''
said Latourette, who said members regarded killing as ``a cleansing
execution.''
   Seven of those charged were arrested in the Kansas City area by
Friday afternoon, said George Rodriguez of the federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Six others were being sought.
   ``We now have four people who have given us a full confession of
their involvement,'' said Dave True, an ATF spokesman in Kansas
City.
   The Averys apparently were targeted as victims because they were
less active in the group than others, LaTourette said.
   ``The Averys were ... falling out of grace,'' he said.
   He said the Averys apparently never attempted to flee the
communal farm, about 20 miles east of Cleveland. LaTourette said
the Averys may have been killed over a ``relatively short period of
time,'' April 16-18, but not ``en masse.''
   While the bodies have yet to be positively identified,
LaTourette said an informant confirmed the identities of the
victims, and Kirtland Fire Chief Richard A. Martincic said a
picture of the Avery family was found in the barn.
   Each of the victims was shot at least twice, according to an
autopsy by Elizabeth Balraj, the coroner in neighboring Cuyahoga
County.
   No federal charges were filed in the case, and Rodriguez said
the defendants will be extradited to Ohio.
   Five of those in custody waived their right to fight
extradition. Two other suspects face extradition hearings Monday.
   Rodriguez said the Averys were members of a splinter religious
group led by Lundgren, a former lay minister of the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.
   Lundgren, 39, his wife, Alice, 38, and son, Damon, 19, were at
large early today. Lundgren and Damon were charged with five counts
of aggravated murder, and Mrs. Lundgren was charged with five
counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.
   Dave True, a spokesman for the ATF in Kansas City, said Lundgren
was thought to be somewhere in Missouri.
   Lundgren left the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
Day Saints in 1988 after his ministry credentials were revoked and
formed his own religious group, said Dale Luffman, president of the
northeast Ohio chapter of the RLDS. The RLDS is separate from the
Salt Lake City-based Mormon Church, or Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints, though they share some beliefs.
   ``He was silenced for ethical reasons,'' Luffman said. ``He
would have been expelled from the church on the basis of
un-Christian conduct had he not withdrawn his membership.''
   Also indicted on five counts of aggravated murder were Richard
Eugene Brand, 26, of Independence, Mo.; Daniel David Kraft, no age
given, of Navoo, Ill.; and Ronald Boyd Luff, 29, of Independence.
   The others indicted on charges of conspiracy and complicity to
commit murder and kidnapping were Deborah Sue Oliverez, 47, of
Independence; Dennis Simms Patrick, 35, of Independence; Sharon
Jean Bluntschly, 31, of Independence; Gregory Scott Winship, 29, of
Euclid, Ohio; Tonya J. Patrick, 33, of Independence; Susie Luff,
31, of Springfield, Mo., and Kathryn Johnson, 36 of Holden, Mo.

   Ella Hoffmann danced for the first time at
age 68 _ because she finally could hear the music.
   A cheerful woman who lives in a retirement home in this small
central North Dakota community, Hoffman had been considered deaf
since birth. But when she was being checked for a growth in her ear
in early December, a specialist discovered she actually could hear
with the help of a hearing aid.
   It was a magical moment.
   ``She looked at me and kind of smiled and giggled,'' audiologist
Jon Richins recalled.
   Hoffmann, who has lived at the Pioneer Park Retirement Home
since 1981, danced for the first time a week later, when a polka
band came to entertain residents of the home.
   ``She kept time, and she danced. She could hear,'' said Helen
Iverson, director of the home. ``It's unbelievable.''
   Sitting in an armchair in her room at Pioneer Park, Hoffmann
laughs a wheezy laugh and sways from side-to-side in a dancing
motion when she's asked about that dance. Her speech unclear and
she doesn't know sign language. But her smile says it all.
   Iverson calls her story a miracle.
   ``When she came to the home in 1981, I was told she was deaf,''
Iverson said. ``But at the same time, I understood she was sent to
school in Minnesota somewhere where she was taught to read and
write.''
   Last fall, Hoffmann complained of a throbbing pain in her right
ear by holding a clenched fist to her head and making a pounding
motion, Iverson said.
   Unable to relieve the persistent pain, her doctor recommended
she see a specialist in Bismarck, about 70 miles southeast of
Hazen, a community of 3,300 people.
   At the Bismarck clinic, Richins asked Iverson if Hoffmann's
hearing had ever been tested. Not to her knowledge, she said.
   ``He took her into a booth, put some headphones on her, and she
raised her hand when she heard a sound,'' Iverson remembered.
   Richins then fitted Hoffmann with a hearing aid, ``and she was
all smiles when the doctor turned up the sound,'' Iverson added.
   Richins was all smiles, too.
   ``When someone says they're deaf, I need to have proof,'' he
said.
   ``There's more stories like this than I would care to admit _
people who have been diagnosed as autistic or placed in homes for
the handicapped,'' Richins said.
   If children aren't developing appropriate speech and language
skills at a young age, their hearing should be checked, he said.
   ``That's what should have happened with Ella years and years
ago,'' Richins said. ``She was probably just lumped in with other
people and assumed to be deaf.''
   ``It's too bad it had to come so late in life,'' Walter Morast,
a cousin and Ella's and Elsa's guardian, said of Ella's hearing aid.
   ``But why this was never done before, I don't really know,''
said Morast, who lives about three miles away from the farm where
the Hoffmanns spent most of their lives.
   Nonetheless, Ella Hoffmann has a new life as she prepares to
turn 69 later this month.
   ``She never came out (of her room) before for activities because
she couldn't hear,'' Iverson said. ``Now she comes out all the
time.''
   Asked in a scrawled note whether she was angry at the thought of
what she might have missed, Hoffmann shook her head ``No.''

   A woman who set a record for living the longest
on an artificial heart before receiving a heart transplant has died
of a heart attack brought on by her battle against infection.
   Carolyn Stadler, 57, of St. Charles died Friday at St. Louis
University Hospital, where she had received two transplants,
officials said. Stadler, the mother of four, lived 440 days on a
Jarvik-7 artificial heart before receiving a heart transplant last
fall.
   Hospital officials said Mrs. Stadler was kept alive by the
Jarvik-7 after her body rejected a first donor heart given her June
30, 1988.
   She had been diagnosed as having idiopathic cardiomyopathy, a
degenerative heart condition. She spent the last 1{ years at the
hospital, where she showed ``an inner grace and faith'' that
strengthened her family, her husband, Roger, said.
   Dr. Leslie Miller of the hospital's cardiology staff said Mrs.
Stadler's case provided much-needed information about reaction to
transplants. Women are more likely to reject heart transplants than
men, Miller said.
   The Jarvik-7 artificial heart was developed by Robert Jarvik at
the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City. It is
capable of replacing the function of both of the heart's pumping
chambers, the right and the left ventricles, and is intended to
keep a patient alive while awaiting a donor heart.
   William DeVries first implanted the Jarvik-7 in 1982 in Barney
Clark, who survived for 112 days.
   Miller said at a Friday news conference that the federal
government is examining artificial hearts as permanent devices.
Approval for some hospitals to begin testing them as permanent
heart replacements is expected within the next year, Miller said.

   Ella Hoffmann danced for the first time at
age 68 _ because she finally could hear the music.
   A cheerful woman who lives in a retirement home in this small
central North Dakota community, Hoffman had been considered deaf
since birth. But when she was being checked for a growth in her ear
in early December, a specialist discovered she actually could hear
with the help of a hearing aid.
   It was a magical moment.
   ``She looked at me and kind of smiled and giggled,'' audiologist
Jon Richins recalled.
   Hoffmann, who has lived at the Pioneer Park Retirement Home
since 1981, danced for the first time a week later, when a polka
band came to entertain residents of the home.
   ``She kept time, and she danced. She could hear,'' said Helen
Iverson, director of the home. ``It's unbelievable.''
   Sitting in an armchair in her room at Pioneer Park, Hoffmann
laughs a wheezy laugh and sways from side-to-side in a dancing
motion when she's asked about that dance. Her speech is unclear and
she doesn't know sign language. But her smile says it all.
   Iverson calls her story a miracle.
   ``When she came to the home in 1981, I was told she was deaf,''
Iverson said. ``But at the same time, I understood she was sent to
school in Minnesota somewhere where she was taught to read and
write.''
   Last fall, Hoffmann complained of a throbbing pain in her right
ear by holding a clenched fist to her head and making a pounding
motion, Iverson said.
   Unable to relieve the persistent pain, her doctor recommended
she see a specialist in Bismarck, about 70 miles southeast of
Hazen, a community of 3,300 people.
   At the Bismarck clinic, Richins asked Iverson if Hoffmann's
hearing had ever been tested. Not to her knowledge, she said.
   ``He took her into a booth, put some headphones on her, and she
raised her hand when she heard a sound,'' Iverson remembered.
   Richins then fitted Hoffmann with a hearing aid, ``and she was
all smiles when the doctor turned up the sound,'' Iverson added.
   Richins was all smiles, too.
   ``When someone says they're deaf, I need to have proof,'' he
said.
   ``There's more stories like this than I would care to admit _
people who have been diagnosed as autistic or placed in homes for
the handicapped,'' Richins said.
   If children aren't developing appropriate speech and language
skills at a young age, their hearing should be checked, he said.
   ``That's what should have happened with Ella years and years
ago,'' Richins said. ``She was probably just lumped in with other
people and assumed to be deaf.''
   ``It's too bad it had to come so late in life,'' Walter Morast,
a cousin and Ella's and Elsa's guardian, said of Ella's hearing aid.
   ``But why this was never done before, I don't really know,''
said Morast, who lives about three miles away from the farm where
the Hoffmanns spent most of their lives.
   Nonetheless, Ella Hoffmann has a new life as she prepares to
turn 69 later this month.
   ``She never came out (of her room) before for activities because
she couldn't hear,'' Iverson said. ``Now she comes out all the
time.''
   Asked in a scrawled note whether she was angry at the thought of
what she might have missed, Hoffmann shook her head ``No.''

   Twenty-five calves were bludgeoned to
death at a dairy farm and the owners are at a loss about the motive.
   The killers apparently used heavy clubs or metal pipes to beat
the 3-month-old calves to death and seriously injure several others
in a corral at the Henry Pylman Dairy, authorities said Friday.
   ``It's got to be some kind of weirdo that would do something
like this,'' said farmer Mike Pylman. ``Why would anyone want to
kill these animals?''
   The animals had an estimated value of $10,000.
   Authorities believe the slaughter took place late Wednesday
night or early Thursday morning.
   ``I can tell you this about them,'' said the farm's
veterinarian, Alyn McClure. ``There had to be more than one. They
had to be very strong, and they were in some kind of killing
frenzy.''

<HEAD>Communist Rebels Say Killed Mayor, U.S. Servicemen Next Targets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANGELES, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist guerrillas near a U.S.
base today claimed responsibility for killing a mayor and said the
next targets will be American servicemen and five more town
officials fighting the insurgency.
   ``This is just the beginning,'' said Joema Garcia, who claims to
be the communist New People's Army area chieftain. ``More
liquidations will follow.''
   Garcia said Mayor Javier Hizon of the town of Mexico, a few
miles southeast of Angeles, was assassinated for leading the
creation of anti-communist militia groups in his area. Hizon and a
police escort were gunned down Friday outside the mayor's home as
he departed for work.
   Angeles, in Pampanga province, is home of the U.S.-run Clark Air
Base, about 50 miles north of Manila.
   Garcia said five other Pampanga mayors and American servicemen
believed to be ``collaborating'' with the Philippine military would
be killed. He said the killings would be in retaliation for
setbacks suffered by Communist insurgents in the area last year.
   He declined to give the names of any targets.
   Military sources said government troops have killed 38 of the
estimated 73 Communist guerrillas operating in the province during
the last two years.
   Communist rebels are believed to have killed two American
civilian employees of a U.S. installation near the Clark base last
September and three other Americans in Angeles in October 1987.
   In Maguindanao province, government troops Friday killed six
Moslem rebels belonging to a band of separatist insurgents who
faked a surrender before ambushing two vehicles sent to pick them
up, the military reported.
   Brig. Gen. Orlando Soriano, regional army commander, said the
three-hour clash occurred in the town of Barira, 480 miles
southeast of Manila.
   Soldiers recovered 15 firearms from the site, Soriano said.
   He said the slain guerrillas belonged to a band of 130 Moro
National Liberation Front members who were allegedly surrendering
to the government Wednesday but ambushed the trucks in the nearby
village of Buldon.
   Three government representatives were killed but a fourth, a
soldier, escaped unhurt to a nearby forest and managed to return to
military headquarters to report the incident, the military said.
   Soriano said the attack was ``treachery of the highest degree.''

   Nine Chinese U.N. employees are protesting
orders to return home when their contracts expire and say their
pro-democracy activities are being held against them, U.N. staff
officials said.
   But U.N. spokesman Francois Giuliania said Friday the cases were
examined and that the ``contracts cannot be renewed unless their
government asks us to do so.''
   The U.N. employees union has protested to Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar on their behalf and its officials have said
they will support the Chinese if they seek political asylum.
   Some of the Chinese also protested the requirement that they
turn over their paychecks to the Chinese Mission and receive a
small monthly stipend _ a common practice among many communist
countries at the United Nations.
   The complaint to the secretary-general was lodged by the U.N.
Staff Committee President Lowell L. Flanders.
   Of the 12,338 U.N. staff employes in New York, Geneva and
Vienna, about 275 are from China, Flanders said. The complaint
concerns five employees in New York, two in Geneva and two in
Vienna. They include typists, translators and Chinese language
reporters.
   Yuan Shibing, counselor at the Chinese U.N. Mission, said
Friday: ``Their contracts have expired and it is normal practice
that they should go home because normally our people work in
rotation.''
   Although some of the Chinese employees took part in
demonstrations against the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement
last spring, Yuan said: ``It has nothing to do with that.''
   Chinese troops killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people
when soldiers marched on Beijing June 3-4 and crushed the
student-led pro-democracy movement.
   Since then, there have been sympathy demonstrations, petitions
and vigils by Chinese government employees overseas, including some
at the United Nations.

<HEAD>Judge: Former Beatle Owes Musician Recording Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled that Ringo Starr must pay a
musician more than $74,000 to cover recording costs for a record
album the former Beatle wanted to silence.
   Superior Court Judge Clarence Cooper, who issued a permanent
injunction in November preventing produer Chips Moman's company
from releasing the 1987 album, ruled that Starr must pay Moman
$74,354 to cover costs of the recording sessions, and 7 percent
interest.
   Starr contended he was under the influence of alcohol at the
time the album was recorded and said he wasn't satisfied with the
results after listening to the tapes.
   He sued Moman and his CRS Records of College Park, Ga., to block
the album's release.
   The album included some new material along with some older
songs, such as ``I Can Help'' and ``Ain't That a Shame.'' At the
non-jury trial in November, Moman testified that Bob Dylan made a
guest appearance on one song.
   An attorney for Starr, Robert Fleming Jr., said Friday he yet to
see the ruling but indicated he was satisfied with it as he
understood it.
   Moman had contended that Starr owed him $146,239.
   Tom Washburn III, Moman's attorney, said he hadn't seen the new
ruling, but added, ``If it is as I understand it to be, then what
the court has done for some unknown reason is partially enforce the
agreement.''
   If so, Washburn said, he plans to appeal.

   A judge ruled that the small town where
the Ku Klux Klan was born enacted a mostly unconstitutional set of
ordinances aimed at blocking KKK marches, but he upheld one part
that spoils a planned protest.
   U.S. District Judge John T. Nixon on Friday said most of
Pulaski's parade ordinances were an unconstitutional abridgement of
free speech. But he said the limit of one parade per day in the
town of 8,000 was reasonable.
   On Jan. 13, when the KKK wanted to march in Pulaski to protest
the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, another group beat the Klan in
signing up first to march.
   The KKK will instead demonstrate on the date in Lawrenceburg.
The towns are 25 miles apart and south of Nashville, near the
Alabama line.
   The holiday honoring the civil rights leader, slain in Memphis
in 1968, will be observed Jan. 15.
   ``He struck practically all parts of the ordinance except the
one that we were interested in,'' Thom Robb, national director of
the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, told a news conference after the
hearing.
   The judge struck down provisions of the Pulaski ordinance that
barred parade permits to those advocating violence to people based
on race, national origin or religion and to those wearing masks or
disguises.
   Pulaski is the birthplace of the original KKK in the late 19th
century. Residents say they are tired of the distinction. The
parade-limiting ordinance was passed following an October march by
members of a white supremacy group, The Aryan Nations.
   The KKK has marched in Pulaski to protest the King holiday for
the past three years and Robb said up to 400 people might take part
in this year's march.
   Robb said the Klan would parade in Pulaski in February, possibly
on other dates in January and throughout the year.
   George Barrett, a Nashville lawyer arguing on behalf of the
American Civil Liberties Union, reminded Nixon that the ordinance
restricting parades was similar to laws enacted 25 years ago to try
to thwart civil rights marches, including those led by King.
   ``The best way to honor Dr. King is to vindicate the First
Amendment,'' Barrett said. ``Vindication of the First Amendment is
the legacy of Dr. King.''
   Of the judge's ruling from the bench, Barrett said, ``I'm very
pleased. I think the basic thrust of the lawsuit was the
unconstitutionality of the ordinance. I don't think it was a
victory for the Klan or a defeat for the good people of Giles
County.''

<TEXT>
   More former re-education camp inmates
and relatives arrived here today from Vietnam en route to new lives
in the United States, whose forces they fought alongside during the
Vietnam War.
   It was the second day of the first major resettlement of people
who were imprisoned because they served the U.S.-backed South
Vietnam government that communist forces toppled in April 1975.
   A total of 151 former inmates and their families arrived in
Bangkok this n morning and afternoon charter flights from Ho Chi
Minh City, said Komol Srinakul of the International Organization
for Migration. The agency handles medical processing and
transportation of the refugees. On Friday, 156 arrived.
   The Vietnamese will join relatives in California and other
states after a few days at a Thai immigration center.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Friday the
administration hopes at least 7,000 former detainees and their
relatives will be resettled by Sept. 30.
   Those who arrived in Bangkok Friday expressed joy at finally
reaching ``the free world'' after many years of internment and
waiting. Some described conditions in the Vietnamese camps as very
bad, and one claimed he saw guards shoot dead 25 prisoners who
tried to flee.
   They said Vietnamese citizens were watching closely the
pro-democracy movements in Eastern Europe and hoped the revolution
would come to their country.
   The agreement on resettling former inmates was reached between
Hanoi and Washington in July. The U.S. negotiator, senior State
Department official Robert L. Funseth, said at the time it would
help heal ``the last big wound remaining from the war.''
   Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese were subjected for years to
a spartan regimen of manual labor and political study after the
fall of the South Vietnamese government.
   One of the thousands headed for the United States is P. Nguyen's
brother-in-law, who was interned for 12 years.
   ``He's coming next month,'' Nguyen, of Los Angeles, said Friday.
``We prayed for him every year. This is a dream come true. My
sister who is here is very happy. He's coming home to his children.
   ``Tomorrow is my nephew's birthday and his birthday gift will be
his father coming home.''
   Nguyen said he and some of his relatives were ``lucky enough to
escape from Vietnam in 1975.''
   According to a U.S. source in Bangkok, Washington believes about
100,000 former camp inmates are among the 600,000 Vietnamese who
have applied to emigrate to the United States. He said Hanoi
estimates former inmates and their families total 550,000 people.
   Vietnam has freed hundreds of the prisoners in recent years, and
in June, Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said only about 120
people remained interned.
   Hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have been resettled in the
United States since the war, but political bickering had hindered
progress on emigration of the former inmates. The two countries
still do not have diplomatic relations, mainly because the United
States has opposed Vietnam's 1978 invasion of Cambodia.

   Actor James Brolin narrowly escaped
unhurt when the single-engine airplane he was piloting crashed
during takeoff and burst into flames, a sheriff's spokesman said.
   A strong gust of wind on Friday afternoon blew the plane off the
runway and down an embankment, said Sgt. Ernie Roop of the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
   Brolin, 49, escaped ``moments before the plane burst into
flames,'' Roop said.
   He was alone on the four-seat Cessna 182 when the accident
occurred at Agua Dulce Airport in Saugus, 33 miles northwest of Los
Angeles. The plane was destroyed by fire.
   The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the
accident, according to a Federal Aviation Administration regional
duty officer who declined to give his name.
   Brolin is best known for his role as the apprentice to Robert
Young in the prime-time television series, ``Marcus Welby M.D.'' He
won an Emmy Award in 1970 for the role.
   He also has starred in the television drama ``Hotel'' and has
appeared in several films, including ``Pee Wee's Big Adventure''
and ``The Amityville Horror.''

   A Liberian army commander said ``armed
dissidents'' who entered northeastern Liberia nearly two weeks ago
killed more than 200 civilians, including seven people praying at a
mosque, radio reported.
   Brig. Gen. Edward Smith, army commander in embattled Nimba
county, reported the civilian casualties Friday when he briefed
President Samuel K. Doe on the situation, according to the
independent evangelical station Radio Elwa, based in Monrovia.
   The radio quoted Smith as saying that in one border town seven
people had been shot and killed as they were praying in a mosque.
He apparently did not give details of the other civilian deaths,
but said only one Liberian soldier was killed in the fighting.
   Smith said a few of the dissidents remained on the run
``sporadically attacking civilians in the forest areas of Nimba,''
but that Liberia's forces were bringing the situation under control
and had driven the rebels from Butuo, a border town.
   The radio broadcast, monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp., did not say whether Smith and Doe discussed the number of
Liberians who reportedly have fled into neighboring Ivory Coast to
escape the violence.
   Diplomats have said it is difficult to determine the number of
Liberians fleeing because the border area is heavily forested and
communications are poor. However, some reports have put the figure
as high as 10,000.
   Smith also displayed identity cards he said were taken from the
dissidents in the fight, three of which he claimed showed that some
of the rebels were Ivorian nationals, the radio said.
   Liberia repeatedly has accused Ivory Coast of harboring Doe's
opponents, a charge the Ivorians deny. Justice Minister Jenkin
Scott said Tuesday the invaders, whose numbers he put at 96, had
been trained in Burkina Faso and Libya. Burkina Faso has denied the
claim.
   The fighting erupted Dec. 24 when, Liberia says, two groups of
rebels entered the country from Ivory Coast intent on overthrowing
Doe. Doe said it was the fifth time in his 10-year rule that
dissidents have tried to infiltrate from Ivory Coast.
   The dissidents, led by Charles Taylor, a former civil servant in
Doe's government, call themselves the National Patriotic Front and
appear to have no connection with Liberia's opposition parties,
according to diplomats.
   Officials of the United People's Party, the largest opposition
group in Liberia, have condemned the invaders for using
unconstitutional methods against the government.
   Doe is a pro-Western former military officer who runs Liberia on
a free-market economy. The former sergeant major seized power in a
bloody April 1980 coup in which President William Tolbert, a
descendant of freed American slaves, and most of his political
allies were killed.
   Liberia was founded by freed American slaves in 1847.

<HEAD>Twins Who Posed for Playboy Plead Innocent to Tax Evation Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twins who were Playboy magazine models pleaded
innocent to charges that they evaded taxes on about $1 million they
allegedly received from an elderly businessman.
   The government claims that Leigh Ann Conley and Lynette Harris,
35, failed to pay taxes on money they received from Shorewood
businessman David Kritzik, who died in June at the age of 89.
   The twins entered innocent pleas Friday.
   Harris claims she was the elderly millionaire's mistress and
that the money she received was a gift and thus not reportable as
income. She has said her sister received cash gifts from Kritzik to
compensate her for lost income.
   The twins appeared together in two films and in Playboy in 1978
and 1981. Harris says their joint movie careers were sidelined by
her seven-year, full-time relationship with Kritzik.
   The government charges that the money, which ranged from $60,000
to $257,000 per year from 1984 to 1987, represented direct payments
for services and could not be construed as gifts.
   Harris, formerly of Arlington, Texas, and now of Mukwonago, is
charged with two counts of tax evasion and two counts of failure to
file federal income tax returns. If convicted, she could face a
maximum prison sentence of 12 years and fines totaling $625,000.
   Conley, of the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, is charged with
four counts of failure to file income taxes. She could be sentenced
to as many as four years and fined as much as $325,000 if convicted
on the charges.
   Harris, who was not named in Kritzik's will, has filed a $5
million claim in Probate Court against his estate.
   David Kritzik was a mail-order merchandiser who founded General
Merchandising Co. It was sold in 1962 to the JC Penney Co. for $11
million.
   U.S. Magistrate Aaron E. Goodstein allowed the pair to remain
free on $20,000 recognizance bonds. He ordered them to report to
the federal probation and parole office here biweekly.
   A jury trial was set for March 5 before Federal Judge Thomas J.
Curran.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze today held his country's first talks with the interim
government that ousted and executed Nicolae Ceausescu, and the
agenda was expected to include stronger economic ties.
   The common border that divides Romanians from their ethnic
brethren in Soviet Moldavia also was expected to be a topic.
   Shevardnadze was welcomed at Otopeni airport by Foreign Minister
Sergiu Celac and other Romanian officials, the state-run Rompres
news agency reported.
   Shevardnadze met soon after with Ion Iliescu, president of the
ruling National Salvation Front Council, Rompres said. The talks
were held behind closed doors and no details were disclosed.
   Security was tightened in Bucharest to protect the prominent
Soviet visitor. Soldiers lined the streets from the Soviet Embassy
to the airport, a 20-minute ride, and tanks and armored personnel
carriers were positioned at the airport as Shevardnadze arrived.
   Unlike other East European movements toward democracy, Romania's
revolution last month strengthened rather than weakened ties with
Moscow, strained for decades by Ceausescu's maverick foreign and
trade policies and further hurt by his resistance to the reforms of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Shevardnadze's trip will be a brief, one-day affair. But Silviu
Brucan, a foreign policy expert in the leadership of the National
Salvation Front running Romania, has said Bucharest's new
government has high hopes for the trip.
   Moscow already has pledged aid, including natural gas and oil
supplies to ensure that Romania's 23 million citizens get adequate
heat and light, both strictly rationed during the past eight
winters by Ceausescu.
   In an interview with Bucharest radio broadcast Friday,
Shevardnadze said the Romanian revolution ``has enormous
significance for the interests of Europe and has an echo which can
justifiably be considered as universal, important for the entire
world.''
   One touchy issue likely to be on the agenda is relations with
Soviet Moldavia, which consists largely of territory annexed from
Romania by Josef Stalin in 1940 under a secret protocol to the
Hitler-Stalin pact.
   Many Moldavians pushing for more autonomy from Moscow hope
Romania's revolution will open one of Eastern Europe's most tightly
closed borders and boost cultural and other exchanges severely
restricted in the past.
   On economic matters, Lt. Gen. Victor Stanculescu, who is in
charge of the economy for the Front, said in an interview published
Friday that some trading partners agreed to accept exports of
industrial products instead of food. He did not name the countries,
but food has been one of Romania's exports to the Soviet Union.
   Ceausescu, the hard-line Communist dictator ousted Dec. 22 and
executed with his wife Elena on Christmas Day, exported vast
quantities of food, especially meat, to the Soviet Union to ensure
energy supplies from Moscow.
   But he used most of them for his pet industrial projects,
imposing strict rationing that forced Romanians to wear thick coats
in their homes and offices in winter, and had opera orchestras
playing in gloves and fur hats.
   The new government has overturned the energy restrictions and
many of Ceausescu's most unpopular decrees, abolishing the death
penalty, promising free travel and releasing political prisoners
and others under a general amnesty for those jailed for less than
five years.
   The National Salvation Front also has promised to unveil a new
election law by the end of January and hold free elections by April.
   But there is mounting concern that the Front, which reversed an
earlier decision not to contest the elections, will have an unfair
advantage at the polls because of its control of the media and high
profile as the interim government.
   Western politicians visiting Bucharest Friday called for
international monitoring to ensure that any elections staged would
be fair.
   U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said other fledgling parties hoping
to contest the elections lacked the ``tools of democracy'' and
called for a national referendum in April on when to hold general
elections.
   Otto Lambsdorff, the former West German Economics Minister who
came to Bucharest Thursday to discuss economic aid, also said the
Front could be privileged in elections.
   ``It would perhaps be necessary to assure international
supervision for the results of the elections to be completely
fair,'' Lambsdorff told a news conference.
   The half-dozen political parties in the two weeks since
Ceausescu was ousted have argued that they lack even such basic
resources as typewriters, which under Ceausescu had to be
registered so the government could trace dissident documents.
   They want the elections postponed until the second half of 1990,
when Romania will be one of five Warsaw Pact countries holding the
first free elections since Stalin decreed in the late 1940s that
Communist parties should take over in all the East European
countries liberated by the Soviets at the end of World War II.

<HEAD>ANC Calls For Protests At Hungarian Properties Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The guerrilla-backed African National
Congress today called on supporters to demonstrate outside
Hungarian embassies in protest of contacts between South Africa's
white-led government and Hungary's new rulers.
   ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo said international pressure
also was needed to halt South African efforts to recruit skilled
immigrants from Hungary and other East European nations.
   The recruitment drive was intended to give ``a longer lease of
life'' to the apartheid system of racial segregation, Nzo told the
semi-official Zimbabwe Inter African News Agency. ``The action must
be stopped in its tracks,'' he said.
   Demonstrators ``must show the new rulers in Hungary that what
they have done in a counter-revolution,'' the exiled black South
African guerrilla leader added.
   Nzo was in transit in Harare on his way from Mozambique to the
ANC external headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia. On Thursday, South
African Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha ended a two-day visit
to Budapest, during which he held talks with his Hungarian
counterpart, Gyula Horn.
   The first known visit by a senior South African official to a
Warsaw Pact country drew sharp criticism from Hungarian democratic
opposition groups, the ANC and anti-apartheid activists in South
Africa.
   Nzo told Ziana today the ANC will soon send officials to
unspecified East European capitals to assess political changes
there.
   The ANC, the main guerrilla organization fighting in South
Africa, traditionally has received the bulk of its diplomatic and
material aid from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact governments.
   On Friday Botha said upon his return from Hungary that his
country hopes to establish diplomatic ties with the Budapest
government.
   He told reporters at Johannesburg's airport that the two
countries will investigate possible cooperation in trade,
industrial development and tourism. He said South Africans could
now travel to Hungary ``without any problem.''
   Botha also said his government wanted Eastern Europeans to come
to South Africa to ease a labor shortage in skilled jobs.
   Anti-apartheid groups say South Africa should be training blacks
for the jobs, not wooing white immigrants.

   Two men arrested for fighting
in a beachfront children's wading pool were freed by hundreds of
angry blacks who pelted police with stones and bottles, a police
spokesman said today.
   The incident occurred Friday in the resort city of Durban and
was one of the worst confrontations since President F.W. de Klerk's
proclamation late last month that formerly segregated beaches would
be open to all races.
   Lt. Bala Naidoo, a police spokesman in Durban, said a unit of
seven white and Indian policemen was charged by 1,000 blacks after
officers arrested two black men who had been fighting in a wading
pool intended for use by children. One officer was injured on the
hand by a thrown bottle, Naidoo said.
   According to Naidoo, the officers decided not to fire their guns
for fear of inciting a full-scale riot.
   Prior to the incident, authorities had reported few racial
confrontations during the Christmas and New Year's holidays despite
huge crowds at beaches around Durban and Cape Town. In both areas,
there had been some whites-only beaches until de Klerk's
proclamation.
   A white Durban businessman, Norman Loubscher, said Friday he had
collected 3,000 signatures on a petition calling for re-segregation
of some local beaches. Loubscher contended that the large influx of
blacks has led to a ``dirty, crowded mess'' along the shore.
   Police headquarters, in its daily report today on unrest during
the last 24 hours, said a black man was shot and killed by police
in the eastern Cape Province town of Molteno when he charged at
officers with a hatchet during a confrontation.
   In Shongweni, a black township near the Natal Province city of
Pietermaritzburg, a woman was burned to death by a mob, police
said. Rival black political factions in the area have been feuding
violently for three years.

   Police have arrested a switchman in
connection with Pakistan's worst rail disaster in which 307 people
were killed and 700 injured when two trains collided in a station,
officials said today.
   Army and civilian medical spokesmen said about 345 people
remained hospitalized, 98 in critical or serious condition,
following the collision between a passenger train and a freight
train.
   They said there were no foreigners among the victims.
   Railway spokesmen said an improperly-set switch apparently sent
an express train loaded with sleeping passengers crashing into a
standing freight train early Thursday at the rural Sangi station.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said immediately after the crash:
``The possibility of sabotage cannot be ruled out.'' Two
investigations were opened.
   The switchman, who worked at the station where the crash
occurred, was arrested Friday and was being questioned, authorities
said. Another switchman and the station master, both of whom fled
after the crash, were still at large.
   Authorities issued warrants for their arrest.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist Party today proposed
that both German states cut their armies in half this year and
undertake other drastic measures to demilitarize Central Europe.
   Party leader Gregor Gysi also proposed that all foreign troops
be phased out of the two Germanys by 1999, according to the
official ADN news agency, which reported on a special meeting of
the Communist Party leadership.
   Communists retain control of the interim East German government
pending free elections in May, and the call for sweeping
disarmament measures is probably aimed at strengthening the party's
image as the political force most capable of reshaping the nation.
   Cutting defense expenditures would free up state funds for
restructuring industry, pulling East Germany out of its economic
morass.
   Gysi urged cutting the West German and East German armies by 50
percent by next year and said both nations should agree not to
modernize or expand their weapons arsenals.
   West Germany's army stands at 480,000, and there are 250,000
American soldiers on its soil; East Germany has an army of 170,000,
backed by 400,000 Soviet troops.
   West Germany's readiness to go along with such measures probably
would be restricted by its commitments to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, which depends on West Germany as its defensive front
line against the Warsaw Pact.
   But as East Germany and West Germany have closed the gap in
their relations in recent months, the role of the two military
alliances has come into question, and experts have predicted they
could eventually be dissolved as Europe's post-war divides are
healed.
   The military policy expert in West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's political party has proposed establishment of a ``European
Security Union'' to protect the peace in a united Europe.
   In an article to appear Sunday in the Hamburg-based Bild am
Sonntag, Otto Hauser proposes a military force independent of
Washington and Moscow, which he told the newspaper would serve as
``guarantor powers'' for a new peace order on the continent.
   On Friday, East German media indicated that former leader Erich
Honecker, ousted from power, expelled from the Communist Party and
bedridden with illness, may be spared imprisonment.
   An independent medical team determined Friday that Honecker is
in too poor condition to sustain the rigors of prison life and may
need additional surgery to remove a malignant kidney tumor.
   The official ADN news agency said Honecker was checked by
doctors sent by a special parliamentary committee investigating
alleged widespread corruption during Honecker's rule.
   Seven former Communist Party Politburo members have been jailed
pending investigation of charges they abused their power and bilked
the nation of billions in hard currency.
   The 77-year-old Honecker, ousted on Oct. 18, is reported to be
seriously ailing and confined to bed at the Wandlitz estate where
he and other party elite indulged daily in luxuries while the rest
of the nation endured spartan living conditions.
   He underwent surgery in August to remove gallstones and never
fully recovered, East German media have said.
   Honecker was placed under house arrest more than a month ago
after corruption charges were filed against him. ADN said Thursday
the house arrest was lifted several weeks earlier.
   Honecker must be moved from Wandlitz by the end of the month
because the estate is being converted to a facility for the
handicapped.
   Meanwhile, West Germany's construction minister announced Friday
that Bonn will provide aid of $4 billion to renovate crumbling
cities and rebuild housing in East Germany to ease the acute
shortage of living space in both nations.
   Gerda Hasselfeldt and her East German counterpart, Minister for
Construction and Housing Gerhard Baumgaertel, told a news
conference that four seriously deteriorated East German cities will
be rebuilt as a pilot project for cooperation.
   The first beneficiaries will be Meissen _ the Elbe River city
near Dresden famed for its hand-made porcelain, the former
political and cultural center of Weimar, Brandenburg and Stralsund.
   Those cities, and many other urban areas of East Germany,
require major restoration following damage to buildings during
World War II, general neglect under a communist system that gave
priority to industry over living conditions and the devastating
effects of the brown-coal haze choking major cities.
   ``It is my hope that by pursuing all means of improving housing
and construction in this country, that our housing market can be
eased as well,'' Ms. Hasselfeldt said.
   East Germany suffers a serious housing shortage because many
residential buildings are unfit for habitation.
   West Germany's housing problem is due more to a lack of space
and the prohibitively high costs of construction against uncertain
returns in a nation where rent control often limits a landlord's
profit-making ability.

<TEXT>
   Ian ``Ernie'' Horvath, co-founder of the
Cleveland Ballet and once a soloist with the Joffrey Ballet and the
American Ballet Theater, has died of complications from AIDS. He
was 46.
   Horvath, a native of Cleveland, died Friday of pneumonia at St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center.
   Horvath's career spanned nearly three decades and encompassed a
broad spectrum of artistic activities. He was an artistic
consultant, administrator and fund-raiser for several dance
companies and foundations, including the National Endowment for the
Arts.
   He also was a dancer, choreographer and teacher who formed
Cleveland's ballet company and its school with fellow dancer Dennis
Nahat.
   Horvath spent much of his last years reviving interest in the
repertory of choreographer Jose Limon.
   ``He knew so much about the field,'' said Rick Reynolds,
managing director of the Jose Limon Dance Foundation.
   Reynolds said Horvath, the foundation's producing director since
1987, ``was able to communicate artistic ideas and necessities to
people who didn't know (much) about the arts. In that way, he was
unique.''
   Horvath left the Cleveland Ballet in 1984 and did free-lance
choreography and consulted for dance companies.
   He became a soloist with the Joffrey in 1964. Horvath left the
Joffrey in 1967 for the American Ballet Theater, where he danced
principal roles in a variety of classical and contemporary ballets
choreographed by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Agnes de
Mille.
   He also appeared on Broadway in ``Funny Girl'' and ``Sweet
Charity'' in the mid-1960s.
   While dancing with the ABT, he worked as assistant choreographer
for the Royal Swedish Ballet and London Ballet, for which he
prepared performances of several Nahat ballets.
   Horvath returned to Cleveland in 1972, establishing the
Cleveland Dance Center ballet school with Nahat and Charles Hicoll,
his former teacher. Horvath and Nahat started the Cleveland Ballet
as a professional company in 1976. Horvath served as artistic
director until 1984.
   Horvath began choreographing in 1974, and based his last piece,
``No Dominion,'' on his illness.
   Horvath sometimes served as a spokesman for people with AIDS. He
helped organize ``Dancing For Life,'' an AIDS fund raiser at the
New York State Theater in September 1987 and appeared in a
television program on AIDS made in October 1988.
   During his month-long hospitalization before his death, Horvath
was ``concerned about other people more than himself,'' said his
brother, Jim Horvath. ``He fought all the way to the end.''
   In addition to his brother, he is survived by his parents,
Ernest and Helen, a sister, Debbie Zimmer, all of Tucson, Ariz.,
and his long-time companion, Rodger Barrow of New York City.

<TEXT>
   Christian army units and Syrian-backed
Moslem militiamen exchanged artillery and tank fire across Beirut's
dividing Green Line today, the first serious fighting in the civil
war in three months.
   Police said two civilians were killed when an artillery shell
crashed into the Sinn el-Fil residential area, on the Christian
side of the three-mile sectarian line. Two other people were
wounded in the exchanges that engulfed the neraby Sodeco and Ras
el-Nabaa districts.
   The morning clash followed the arrival of President Elias Hrawi
in Syrian-policed west Beirut. He moved into an apartment building
where he will live and have an office. He did so to avoid having to
commute to work in an area where his predecessor was killed by a
car bomb in November.
   Thunderous shell blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire echoed
across the Moslem and Christian sectors of the divided capital.
   Both sides accused each other of shooting first.
   The fighting eased at noon, then resumed in the afternoon,
forcing police and army units to close the Green Line's mid-city
Museum Crossing, the only gateway linking the two halves of the
divided capital.
   A police spokesman said the fighting was ``the gravest
violation'' of a cease-fire called by the Arab League on Sept. 22
to halt six months of savage artillery duels between the Syrian
army and troops loyal to the Christian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun. At
least 929 people were killed and 2,744 wounded during that
six-month confrontation.
   Fighting also raged into a third week in south Lebanon between
militiamen of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and
the pro-Syrian mainstream Amal. But police said no new casualties
were reported in the inter-Shiite battles today. At least 77 people
have been killed and 275 wounded since fighting flared between the
two factions on Dec. 23.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been vying for two years for mastery of
the 1.2 million Shiites who make up the country's largest sect.
   After moving into the apartment building in Ramlet al-Baida,
Hrawi received the credentials of papal nuncio Pablo Puente. That
reflected the Vatican's recognition of his government as the
legitmate adminstration.
   The move totally isolates Aoun, who has rejected both Hrawi's
election and the peace plan Parliament approved in October. All
other foreign countries with diplomatic missions in Lebanon have
already recognized the ``national reconciliation'' government
formed in November to oversee implementation of a Christian-Moslem
peace plan to end 14 years of civil war.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, called on supporters to stage a
``human chain of demonstrations'' today along the 25-mile route
from the presidential palace in Baabda to Puente's residence in
Harissa to protest the Vatican's decision.
   Aoun commands 20,000 mainly Christian troops who control the
Christian enclave in east Beirut and the hinterland to the north
and northeast.
   Hrawi, also a Maronite, fired Aoun as army commander and
caretaker prime minister in November. But the general remained
entrenched in the presidential palace, refusing to turn over the
traditional seat of heads of state to Hrawi.
   Aoun had issued a decree on Nov. 4 dissolving the 99-seat
Parliament which approved the Lebanon peace accord despite his
opposition. He called for elections on Jan. 7, an issue which would
cement the paritition of the country.
   But the three-man Cabinet he heads decided Friday to postpone
the elections for a month and send an envoy in the meantime to New
York to request that the United Nations send observers to supervise
elections on Feb. 7.
   With 40,000 Syrian troops controlling 70 percent of the country,
and Israel occupying a 328-square-mile enclave in the south, the
chances of holding general elections remain remote.
   The United Nations, which has voiced support for Hrawi, also is
unlikely to endorse a request for observers from Aoun.

   Radio Moscow said today that President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has not canceled all January meetings with foreigners to
deal with domestic problems, contrary to earlier reports that upset
world financial markets.
   The radio report said Gorbachev still planned to meet with U.N.
chief Javier Perez de Cuellar during the week of Jan. 15.
   In Tokyo, an official of the governing Liberal Democratic Party
said today that former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe received an
invitation to meet with Gorbachev on Jan. 15.
   Tokyo and Hong Kong markets declined and New York trading was
upset Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 22.83
points, after a British Labor Party spokesman said Gorbachev
canceled his meeting with opposition leader Neil Kinnock set for
Jan. 16.
   The message to Kinnock explaining the cancellation said the
Soviet leader was ``postponing contact with foreign politicians
scheduled for January'' to deal with domestic problems.
   A top Communist Party official in Moscow confirmed that
Gorbachev had canceled appointments with Kinnock and other
foreigners.
   Abe, an influential member of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party,
originally hoped to meet with Gorbachev in December, said party
spokesman Iwao Kon.
   He said Abe received word of the January meeting from the
Central Committee of the Communist Party through Japan's Embassy in
Moscow on Friday night.
   Gorbachev is reportedly planning to spend three days next week
in Lithuania, where the local Communist Party has split from the
Soviet party and adopted a program favoring independence for the
Baltic republic.
   Gorbachev also is concerned with violence in the south.
   KGB troops were rushed to the Soviet-Iranian frontier this week
after Soviet Azerbaijanis tried to force open the frontier and
reunite with their ethnic brethren in Iran. Fences remain flattened
and other barriers out of commission along the border, Soviet TV
reported Friday night. Protesters reportedly caused $4.9 million in
damage.
   Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow, said today the
violence was caused by Azerbaijanis unhappy with delays in plans to
expand border trade, cultural exchanges and meetings of relatives
divided by the border.
   By the time an ultimatum expired on New Year's Eve, the border
zone was occupied by protesters living in tents, and authorities
found 300 Molotov cocktails and hunting guns, the newspaper
Arguments and Facts said today.
   When negotiations collapsed on New Year's Day, 9,000 people
rioted along an 85-mile stretch of the border from the Soviet side,
and 800 people from the Iranian side joined them, the newspaper
said.
   A new Communist Party chief was named for the area, the
republic's official news agency, Azerinform, said today. Afedin
Dzhalilov was named party first secretary of Nakhichevan to replace
Gaidar Isayev, who retired because of a lengthy illness, the agency
said.
   Meanwhile, officials in Agdam near the long-troubled district of
Nagorno-Karabakh played down a report from the People's Front of
Azerbaijan that Armenian extremists were responsible for the
explosion of the Agdam bus station early this morning that left two
people missing.
   A deputy police chief in Agdam said a preliminary investigation
indicated the blast was caused by a nearby gas pipeline.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been torn by ethnic violence between
Armenians and Azerbaijanis for two years. Armenians, who make up
most of the population, want the area transferred from the
jurisdiction of Azerbaijan to Armenia.

   President Bush is sending Vice President Dan
Quayle on a mission of ``very, very important diplomacy'' to repair
relations with Latin nations, as he vows he is ``not seeking a
deal'' with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush said he will dispatch Quayle to reverse the negative
reaction to the military invasion of Panama, which was roundly
deplored in Central and South America.
   The president, during a White House news conference Friday, also
said the reconstruction of Panama's economy will be a ``major
priority'' for his administration.
   It was learned Friday that the administration is considering a
range of possibilities to help the ravaged country, including: new
housing for people left homeless; helping Panama pay its $543
million in foreign debt; getting other nations involved in the
recovery effort; and facilitating loans for businesses.
   Recommendations have yet to be drawn up and presented to Bush,
but one administration source said, ``There's a sense of urgency
and we want to move quickly and respond quickly.''

   In another development, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today
that the Panama invasion should not be viewed as heralding a new
``Bush doctrine'' under which the United States would be inclined
to intervene militarily in other countries where democratic
elections are subverted.
   Appearing on Cable News Network's ``Evans and Novak'' program,
Cheney was asked specifically about what the United States would do
if elections scheduled for February in Nicaragua are ``stolen'' by
the ruling Sandinista regime.
   Cheney responded that the Panama action ``is not the beginning
of the new Bush doctrine, where under every circumstance we would
always use military force to intervene in order to enforce, if you
will, the outcome of a free electoral process.''

   At Friday's news conference, the president did not rule out a
plea bargain with Noriega in exchange for intelligence information
the deposed dictator might offer on drug trafficking.
   ``Our government is not seeking a deal with Noriega,'' Bush told
reporters following his meeting with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to discuss the drug-trafficking indictment against
Noriega.
   However, when asked if he was ruling out the possibility of a
plea bargain, he replied only, ``I`m not ruling it in.''
   ``I'm just saying he's got his rights and .. we ought not to
stand up here and try to define narrowly what they are,'' he added,
leaving open the possibility that Noriega might seek the plea
bargain.
   In Miami, Noriega attorney Steven Kollin said Noriega wasn't
interested in a plea bargain because he considers himself innocent.
   Bush said he would ``bend over backwards'' not to make any
comments that would prejudice the case against Noriega.
   With Noriega finally in U.S. custody, the president is turning
his attention to shoring up relations in the Latin world. Quayle's
itinerary is not yet determined, nor is the timetable for his trip,
but he will visit countries in both Central and South America, said
his press secretary, David Beckwith.
   Acknowledging the negative reaction by the Latins to his Dec. 20
invasion of Panama, Bush said: ``I am concerned, because I am well
aware of how our friends south of our border ... look at the use of
American force anywhere.''
   He said that damage is ``correctable.''
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Bush is considering a trip to Panama. But the president said
he had ``no plans'' for such a trip. Panama could be a stop on
Quayle's trip.
   Bush did not say how much he might spend to help Panama recover
but some estimates of invasion-related damage have been up to $2
billion.
   One administration official said is it likely the March date for
certification on whether Panama's government is cooperating with
U.S. anti-drug efforts will be moved up. If the administration, as
expected, reverses Panama's current situation of non-compliance _
stemming from the Noriega regime _ its new government could partake
in various trade and economic benefits.
   Bush said some 12,000 troops stationed at U.S. bases in Panama
before the invasion would be left there, but would not serve a
police role.
   Some 2,900 of the 14,000 additional combat troops that conducted
the invasion were brought home this week, the Pentagon said.
   Bush also said:
   _He envisions no change in U.S. policy against intentionally
sending military women into combat, although he would weigh such a
recommendation if presented to him by the Pentagon.
   _He deplores the death of an American nun in Nicaragua, but
noted the U.S.-backed Contra rebels denied responsibility. He
called the matter of blame ``extraordinarily murky.''

   A judge stayed the execution of a
``naughty monkey'' and will consider a request from animal lovers
to banish it to a wildlife sanctury, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The monkey, which is in police custody in the port city of
Trivandrum, was to have been killed Friday on an order issued by a
local magistrate, The Hindu newspaper said.
   But after receiving a petition pleading for mercy on the
monkey's behalf, the Trivandrum Sessions Court issued a stay of
execution until Jan. 11 when a hearing will be conducted, The Hindu
said.
   The newspaper did not say why or when the monkey was captured,
referring to it only as a ``naughty monkey'' who ``fell into a
police trap.''
   Indian newspapers frequently report monkeys terrorizing school
children, snatching their lunch boxes and even raiding homes in
search for food.
   Monkeys are a common sight in India. Many Hindus do not hurt
them because they evoke images of the monkey-god Hanuman and his
band of monkey warriors who defeated a demon king in Hindu
mythology.
   Trivandrum, in Kerala state, is 1,364 miles south of New Delhi.

<TEXT>
   More than 8,000 wild animals,
including endangered species, have been dying each year in a
125-mile-long irrigation canal in northern Namibia, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The Star of Johannesburg said the canal had won two awards from
an engineering institute but was considered ``an ecological
deathtrap'' by conservationists.
   The canal, designed in 1980 and built over the next several
years, is part of a network of reservoirs and pipelines that
enables water to be carried from the Kavango River in northern
Namibia to arid regions.
   The canal rarely carries enough water to drown large animals,
but about half the animals that enter the 12-foot-wide waterway die
because they are unable to climb back out the smooth, curved
concrete sides, The Star said.
   The estimated annual death toll includes 4,700 warthogs, 1,500
hares, 300 baboons, and scores of antelopes, cheetahs, wildcats,
foxes and jackals, The Star said.
   Namibia's Department of Water Affairs has expressed concern
about the deaths but says it lacks the funds to cover the canal,
The Star said. The department reportedly plans to erect a
20-inch-high wire fence along the waterway which it says will
reduce the death rate by 90 percent.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached to Pull Indian Troops From Sri Lanka</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   India and Sri Lanka reached an agreement
Saturday on withdrawing Indian troops from the island nation, the
major irritant in relations between the two countries.
   A joint press statement, issued at the end of Sri Lankan Foreign
Minister Ranjan Wijeratne's visit to New Delhi, said the Indian
peacekeeping force would be completely withdrawn by March 31, and
possibly earlier.
   The two countries will also sign a treaty of friendship, the
statement said.
   The Sri Lankans have been pressing India to speed up the
withdrawal, but they appear to have accepted that it would not be
logistically feasible to withdraw the 25,000 Indians soldiers
before the end of March.
   ``What else can we do? We can't push them into the ocean,''
Wijeratne said in an interview after meeting with Prime Minister
V.P. Singh.
   ``The Sri Lankans were very understanding,'' an Indian Foreign
Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They
understood the logistical problem, they understood that we had no
desire to stay longer than necessary.''
   The official said the Indian government would examine the
possibility of completing the withdrawal earlier.
   India's military deployment in Sri Lanka began in July 1987 and
was intended to supervise the disarming of Tamil militants fighting
for an independent nation in that country.
   But the biggest Tamil guerrilla group refused to honor an
agreement to surrender and turned their guns on the Indians.
   At the peak of the fighting, the Indian force numbered about
100,000 men. At least 1,100 Indian soldiers were killed.
   The Sri Lankan government began pressing for a pullout of the
troops last summer after peace talks with the Tamil guerrillas. But
India refused to hastily withdraw its soldiers, saying it could
lead to more violence.
   Sri Lanka's president issued a July 29 deadline for the Indian
withdrawal, and relations between the countries deteriorated
quickly after India said it would not adhere to the deadline.
   The two countries then decided to complete the withdrawal by
Dec. 31, but Singh, who took office Dec. 2, said logistical
problems precluded meeting that date.
   About 25,000 Indian soldiers are in Sri Lanka now.
   The Tamil separatist revolt began in 1983 and has left at least
11,000 people dead.
   Tamils account for about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people. They allege the Sinhalese majority discriminates against
them in jobs, education and use of the Sinhalese language.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population.
   India, Sri Lanka's northern neighbor, became involved in the
peace efforts because it is the regional power and because of its
own large Tamil population.

<TEXT>
   The cartoonist who created Hustler
magazine's ``Chester the Molester'' has been convicted of molesting
a teen-age girl.
   Dwaine Tinsley, 44, was found guilty of five child molestation
counts by a Superior Court jury on Friday. Jurors agreed Tinsley
had substantial sexual contact with the girl but also acquitted him
of six charges and deadlocked on another five.
   The cartoon created by Tinsley depicts a lecherous character and
his attraction to young girls. He refused to talk with reporters
after the verdict.
   Defense lawyer George C. Eskin promised to appeal the guilty
verdicts, arguing as he did during trial that the young woman
accused Tinsley in retaliation for his efforts to halt her drug use.
   Tinsley faces a maximum prison term of 16 years and a $50,000
fine when he is sentenced March 1, said Deputy District Attorney
Matthew J. Hardy.
   The molestations started in 1984, when the girl was 13 and
continued until age 17, he said.
   Evidence presented at the trial said Tinsley told co-workers,
``You can't write this stuff all the time if you don't experience
it.''
   But Tinsley's ``Chester the Molester'' eliminated its focus on
pedophilia several years ago, Hardy said.
   The prosecutor said the verdicts vindicated the victim, whose
longtime efforts to report the attacks were discredited by adults.
   Tinsley, who now lives in Los Angeles, testified during the
seven-day trial that the woman made up the story because he
disapproved of her cocaine habit.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
safely in U.S. custody, President Guillermo Endara's new government
can start to tackle political and economic problems that will make
recovery difficult.
   ``We have to start from point zero,'' said Endara last week as
he tried to grab the reins of government. ``This is the first time
in Panamanian history that a new government had to start the way we
did.''
   Expectations in the small country of 2 million run high since
the Dec. 20 invasion toppled Noriega. He surrendered to U.S. troops
to face drug trafficking charges in Florida.
   From the businessmen making deals in the city's commercial hub
to the people selling cool coconut water under the hot sun,
Panamanians think dollars will flow ``now that the Americans are
coming back,'' as they like to say.
   ``We are living a difficult moment ... for the worker, for the
businessman,'' said Alfredo Maduro, president of the Chamber of
Commerce in Panama City. ``For the real recovery of the country to
take place, we will need the help of our friends.''
   After two years of U.S. sanctions targeted at undermining
Noriega, and with the devastation that followed the invasion,
Panamanians want the United States to come through with financial
aid now that Noriega is gone. They may get at least part of their
wish.
   ``The revitalization of the Panamanian economy is a major
priority in the months ahead,'' President Bush told a White House
news conference Friday, ``as are our efforts for humanitarian
assistance.''
   In Washington, administration sources said U.S. officials are
looking into building houses for people left homeless; helping
Panama pay its $543 million foreign debt; and providing loans to
help businesses recover.
   One administration official said, ``There's a sense of urgency,
and we want to move quickly and respond quickly.''
   But that will not be the end of Endara's problems. For starters,
he will have to deal with the old conservative oligarchy, stifled
under Noriega, who feel their time has come again. He also has to
try to check some of his own followers' desire for revenge and
spoils.
   At the moment, the government has support because everyone wants
the economy, the country, to get moving.
   To list a few of his other problems:
   _Endara does not have a political party of his own. He led a
coalition ticket in May 7 elections because he had fewer enemies
than his running mates.
   _The Christian Democrat Party of Vice President Ricardo Arias
Calderon is best organized to get key government jobs in bitter
political infighting. Arias is also justice minister, the most
powerful Cabinet post.
   _The country's economy is a shambles. The construction industry
was down to less than 20 percent of its normal level, unemployment
is at more than 20 percent, and government income is less than 50
percent of what it was a year ago.
   _The invasion itself caused damages estimated at at least $2
billion, including the savage three-day looting of Panama City in
the chaos following the invasion. Government economists estimate an
additional $2 billion will be needed to pump up the economy in the
next four years.
   _The United States, whose hand is guiding the actions of the new
and inexperienced government, wants to mold it ``in its image,'' as
a local politico put it, and is pressing for the formation of a
professional military. Most politicians want to do away with the
military that has ruled this country directly or indirectly since
the beginning of the century and form a police force along the
Costa Rican model.
   _There is fear of politically motivated witchhunts by rightist
groups who feel secure with the U.S. Army here.
   ``You are going to have three governments here,'' said an Endara
associate, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The weak Endara
government, the stronger government of the Christian Democrats, and
the overall government of the United States.''
   Already, there are reports of dismissals based on political
allegiances. One of the toughest jobs is the reorganization of a
corrupt judiciary and the the entire legal structure controlled by
the military.
   The question of what to do with the military is a controversial
subject and a source of friction between members of the old Defense
Forces and politicians.
   Both Endara and Arias, apparently under U.S. pressure, have
backed down from statements about eliminating the military. Among
those who wanted the military abolished were economic groups
opposed to Noriega.
   A U.S. military source said a professional military would
provide some of the security the U.S. government requires for the
Panama Canal, while at the same time check the ambitions of
competing economic groups.
   With Noriega gone, the U.S. military feel they can work with
most of the members of his old forces.
   The United States maintains 12,000 troops in 10 installations
here. The U.S. military has trained the Panamanian forces for years
and knows them well. It was Noriega and his associates that were
considered a problem.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Friday the number of U.S. troops here would be reduced to close to
the pre-invasion level of 12,000 ``over the next few weeks.''
   But Panamanian officials privately say the U.S. presence could
be needed much longer, until it is certain Panama's government can
survive on its own.

   Eggs Benedict may be outrageously high in
fancy, big city hotels, but when police heard a Sunday brunch of
one egg was going for $15.50 at a rural mobile home they figured
someone was being stung.
   It turned out it wasn't the customers. They were getting beer
with their eggs, police said, which is OK in Georgia, except on
Sunday.
   Sheriff's deputies arrested a father and son team for violating
the state ban on Sunday alcoholic beverage sales, even though the
men said they were giving the beer away and just charging for the
eggs.
   The deputies then decided to turn the sting around operating out
of the mobile home themselves and arrested 22 people who tried to
buy eggs, with a beer chaser, said Capt. Arney Herrin of the Ware
County sheriff's department.
   Devoy Martin Sr. and Devoy Martin Jr. were arrested Dec. 10.
   With the purchase of a $6 egg, the Martins were throwing in a
six-pack of beer, while a $15.50 egg would bring the buyer two
six-packs of 16-ounce beers, Herrin said.
   Both men are in the Ware County jail awaiting hearings on
probation violations. The elder Martin has two years remaining on a
five-year sentence for selling alcohol on Sunday, and his son is on
probation for habitual violation of the state's drunken-driving law.

   Relatives of slain Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena say they plan to
watch a TV miniseries on his torture-murder at the hands of Mexican
drug traffickers, but they know it will mean reliving the pain.
   Camarena's 65-year-old mother, Dora, said from her home in
Calexico, Calif., that she has seen parts of the miniseries,
scheduled to air Sunday, Monday and Tuesday on NBC-TV, and it was
``very difficult to watch.''
   She plans to see the full program, but wants to get a videotape
copy in case she becomes too emotional to watch the TV.
   ``I want a copy of the movie because I'm not sure I can take
it,'' she said in a telephone interview last week. Her words were
translated from Spanish to English by her daughter, Myrna, who
works for the DEA in San Diego.
   Dora Camarena, who lost one son in the Vietnam War and another
in the drug war, said she is grateful to the DEA, to the media and
to Hollywood for keeping her son's story alive.
   Her daughter said she would watch the full show, even though
she's seen most of it in advance and ``I cried a lot that night
because it brought back memories.''
   Camarena's wife, Mika, has not made any public statements about
the show.
   Myrna Camarena, 35, said she joined the DEA in March 1974 and
her brother followed in June of that year, although, ``He was the
one who talked me into joining DEA'' when he was working as a
narcotics officer for the Calexico police.
   He was kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in Guadalajara. A few days later,
a Mexican pilot who had worked with DEA agents there, Alfredo
Zavala Avelar, also was kidnapped. Their bullet-riddled bodies,
showing signs of torture, were found March 5, 1985, wrapped in
plastic bags and dumped on a ranch 60 miles southeast of
Guadalajara.
   The miniseries, ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story,'' recounts
Camarena's efforts to combat drug trafficking in Mexico, his
kidnapping, torture and murder and DEA efforts to pressure
recalcitrant and sometimes corrupt Mexican officials into finding
the agent and prosecuting those who killed him.
   Camarena's mother and sister said they were angered that a
Mexican official referred to the miniseries as an ``amusement''
during an interview with The Associated Press following a screening
of the movie in Washington.
   The Mexican Embassy minister for narcotics affairs, Gustavo
Gonzalez Baez _ appointed by the new administration of Carlos
Salinas de Gortari that has cracked down on drug traffickers and
corrupt officials _ said Americans ``are accustomed to seeing this
kind of series and they realize this is not reality, this is just
amusement.''
   Noting that the year-old Salinas administration has convicted
major drug traffickers and some public officials in connection with
the murders and has sentenced them to long prison terms, Gonzalez
Baez said the movie suggests ``that all the Mexican authorities
were involved in protecting drug traffickers, and that is
absolutely inaccurate.''
   ``It hurts for them to say it's an amusement because when I saw
the movie, my heart felt the same thing that I felt when it
actually happened,'' Dora Camarena said. ``It shouldn't be taken as
an amusement.''
   She said she was ``very pleased that the new president, Salinas,
is cooperating to end corruption,'' but her daughter said, ``This
is based on a true story. That is reality. We all know there is
corruption in Mexico.''
   DEA and State Department officials have praised the Salinas
administration's efforts, but the miniseries doesn't include that
recent history.
   DEA Administrator John C. Lawn said in an interview that he
considered the miniseries ``about 80 percent accurate,'' while
David Westrate, DEA's director of operations, said, ``There's a lot
of pretend in there.'' Except for Lawn and Camarena, virtually all
the DEA personnel depicted in the miniseries are composites based
on several real-life people.
   For Camarena's mother, the show brings her son's work back to
life.
   ``He gave his full strength and everything he could to combat
the drug trafficking in a foreign country. He left an example. ...
I have a lot of faith, and that keeps me going.''

<HEAD>New Battles Erupt Between Christians and Moslems; Two Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian and Moslem fighters battled in
fiery duels across Beirut on Saturday, killing two civilians and
forcing police to close the only gateway linking the divided city.
It was the first serious flare-up in three months.
   The clashes coincided with the arrival of President Elias Hrawi
in west Beirut, where he set up his office and residence and
received credentials of the Vatican representative, Pablo Puente.
   That marked the Vatican's recognition of Hrawi's government and
further isolated the Christian army leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, in
his rejection of the government.
   Aoun's supporters, at his request, staged a ``human chain of
demonstrations'' along the 25-mile route from Aoun's residence to
Puente's home to protest the Vatican's move.
   Other protesters went to Puente's home to deliver a message of
protest from Aoun.
   Thunderous shell blasts and bursts of gunfire echoed across the
Moslem and Christian sectors as soldiers of Aoun's army battled
with Syrian-backed Moslem militiamen. Both sides accused the other
of shooting first.
   A police spokesman said the clash was ``the gravest violation''
of a cease-fire called by the Arab League on Sept. 22 to halt six
months of fighting between Aoun's troops and Syrian forces. Until
Saturday, there had been only minor clashes.
   An artillery shell crashed into the Sinn el-Fil residential
area, on the Christian side of Beirut, and killed two civilian men,
police said. Two other people were wounded in exchanges that
engulfed the nearby Sodeco and Ras el-Nabaa districts.
   The fighting broke out in the morning, eased at noon and picked
up again in the afternoon, forcing police and army units to close
the mid-city Museum Crossing, the only gateway linking Moslem west
Beirut and Christian east Beirut.
   The latest deaths brought to 931 the number of people killed in
Christian-Moslem duels since Aoun in March declared his intention
to drive Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon.
   Aoun rejects Hrawi's presidency became it came about as a result
of an Arab League plan aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war
but not setting a deadline for the withdrawal of the Syrians.
   All foreign countries with diplomatic missions in Lebanon have
recognized Hrawi's ``national reconciliation'' government, which
was formed in November to oversee implementation of the plan.
   Puente said during the Vatican credentials ceremony that the
Holy See favored dialogue to resolve the crisis between Hrawi and
Aoun.
   But a stung Aoun later emerged from his residence outside Beirut
and told cheering demonstrators ``there is no room for dialogue.''
   He drew wild applause when he vowed to bring to justice Hrawi
and all Parliament members who approved the peace accord.
   Aoun commands 20,000 mainly Christian troops who control a
310-square-mile enclave comprising east Beirut and the region to
the north and northeast. He claims the Syrian troops, deployed in
1976 to quell civil war fighting, violated their mandate by siding
with the Moslems, and he declared a ``war of liberation'' in March
to drive them out.
   Hrawi, who like Aoun is a Maronite Catholic, fired Aoun as army
commander and interim prime minister in November.
   Hrawi and his wife, Mona, arrived in a 10-car convoy escorted by
Lebanese army and police units in west Beirut's seaside Ramlet
al-Baida district.
   He set up both his residence and office in the same building to
avoid commuting in the city. His predecessor, Rene Mouawad, was
killed by a bomb Nov. 22 as he drove from his office to his home,
which was in the same building Hrawi is using.
   Meanwhile, fighting raged in south Lebanon between militiamen of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal. No new
casualties were reported.
   At least 77 people have been killed and 275 wounded since the
latest battles flared between the Shiite Moslem militias on Dec.
23. Amal and Hezbollah have been vying for two years for mastery of
the 1.2 million Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect.

<TEXT>
   Seventeen historically black
universities across the South are getting ready to mark the 100th
anniversary of their admission into the nation's land-grant college
system.
   Officials at the ``1890 schools'' are hoping a lot of people
will hear about the party.
   ``It gives us an opportunity to show the country the value of
these institutions to society,'' said William Hytche, president of
the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore and chairman of the
Council of Presidents-Chancellors of the 1890 schools.
   In 1862, Congress passed the National Land-Grant Act, introduced
by Rep. Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, giving the states millions
of acres of public land to establish state schools.
   Twenty-eight years later, Morrill, then a senator, pushed the
Second National Land-Grant Act, also known as the Second Morrill
Act, mandating that opportunities for higher education be extended
to blacks.
   Twelve schools already established, including Florida A&amp;M
University in Tallahassee, were chosen for inclusion in the system.
The other five schools were founded over the next 22 years.
   Since then, some 600,000 students have graduated from the
so-called 1890 schools.
   Centennial celebrations will be organized on each of the
campuses throughout next year as well as in Washington in April
1990. The Aug. 30, 1890, signing of the Second Morrill Act will be
commemorated at Lincoln University in Missouri, founded in 1866 as
the nation's first college for black students.
   The centennial must be celebrated ``within the context of the
struggle'' said Joyce Payne, director of the office of Advancement
of Public Black Colleges in Washington. Kept alive by the
inequities of segregation, the schools have had to struggle for
resources.
   ``They've done more with less than other ... institutions,''
agreed Sharon Worthy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. ``That's a given.''
   The schools, which are either in or near rural, often
poverty-striken areas, have maintained a special interest in
agriculture and engineering even as they developed their liberal
arts programs.
   ``Everybody knows about George Washington Carver and peanuts,''
Ms. Worthy said, referring to the work done at Tuskegee University
in Alabama.
   ``FAMU is committed to the land-grant notion,'' said Frederick
Humphries, president of Florida A&amp;M, the only historically black
school in the state's university system. ``We fill a very special
role of working with the limited resource farmer.''
   The 1890 schools try to help small farmers find a way of making
ends meet, Humphries said.
   In North Florida, that means experimenting with crops such as
blueberries, grapes and Christmas trees.
   Elsewhere, current projects range from joint-research with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration into alternative
foods for outer space to working with farmers in Third World
countries in Africa and the Caribbean.
   Ms. Payne praises the 1890 schools also for their social
accomplishments, saying that they generally have high levels of
integration and large numbers of foreign students.
   White enrollment at the 17 schools is probably in the 10-15
percent range, said Eddie Jackson, spokesman for Florida A&amp;M.
   ``We see the rich legacy of the land-grant tradition remaining
preeminent on the campuses of these 17 campuses,'' Ms. Payne said,
listing teaching, research and public service as the missions of
land-grant schools.
   Hytche, who expresses high hopes for the next 100 years, said
establishment of ``rural economic incubators'' was one priority.
Such centers would increase efforts already being made at the
universities to promote small and rural businesses and would help
them for three or four years as well as train displaced workers.

<HEAD>Panama Intervention Destroys Bush's `Wimp' Image</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, who a few months back was
fending off charges of timidity, is reaping foreign policy and
political gains from the success of a daring military operation in
Panama.
   ``Bush just knocked one out of the park,'' one political analyst
said. ``The `W' (wimp) word will not be heard again,'' said another.
   The U.S. intervention in Panama and subsequent surrender of
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega to U.S. forces is allowing Bush to
bask in praise from leaders of both parties _ something rare for a
president a full year into his term.
   Bush's gamble may have left him in the strongest position yet
since he took office as he awaits the return of Congress on Jan. 23
with his popularity soaring in public opinion polls.
   And, while analysts and political leaders differed on the
long-range payoff, few disputed the short-term value to Bush and
his party _ particularly in this congressional election year.
   ``The president goes into this session of Congress with enormous
credibility, whether on defense spending or domestic policy,'' said
Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   And no harsher a critic than Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
proclaimed the surrender of Noriega ``a triumph for diplomacy and a
triumph for justice.''
   At a news conference on Friday, Bush dismissed an assertion by
Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that
the Panamanian venture was a ``political jackpot.''
   ``A president's called on to take certain actions. We're not
going in to try to furbish a political image; that's ridiculous,''
Bush said.
   But Leslie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the RNC, said Atwater's
``basic point was that anytime an American president does what he
says he's going to do, the public approves wildly. That's what
happened with Panama. And that's the political jackpot.''
   Most analysts seemed to agree.
   ``Bush just knocked one out of the park,'' said Stephen Hess, a
political analyst who specializes in the presidency at the
Brookings Institution, a generally liberal research organization.
``And in international terms, he reminded the rest of the world
that they can't take him for granted.''
   ``This was a high-wire act, this was a big risk,'' Hess added.
``Think of all the ways he could have fallen off the wire, and yet
he got from one side to the other.''
   Mitch Daniels, political director in the Reagan White House and
now a scholar at the conservative Hudson Institute in Indianapolis,
said Bush's success in bringing Noriega to justice ``can't be
overstated.''
   ``There are defining events that tend to be remembered after the
event itself has been forgotten. This was clearly a complex
operation and the president clearly was personally directing
events. And it worked,'' Daniels said.
   ``The `W' word will not be heard again,'' he added.
   Although Bush has not been called a ``wimp'' since early on in
his presidential campaign, Democratic critics, including Senate
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, were accusing him of timidity in
foreign policy as recently as a few months ago.
   Bush was attacked for failing to stand up to the Chinese
government in the aftermath of the bloody Tiananmen Square
crackdown; for reacting too slowly in promising aid for Poland and
other emerging new democracies of Eastern Europe; and for failing
to seize the moment during an abortive coup attempt against Noriega
last October.
   ``Over the long run, in retrospect, it would have been much
better to have intervened in that indigenous coup, rather than to
handle it this way,'' said Norman Ornstein of the conservative
American Enterprise Institute.
   ``We would have been abetting rather than initiating and
carrying out,'' Ornstein said. ``And we would have been less
responsible for Panama. Now, Panamanians are going to look with
some justification to us to bail them out.''
   Even so, Ornstein said, ``Bush's popularity has gone up, praise
for him is across the spectrum. No one will be able to take away
from him the victory that comes when you say, `I'm going to do
this. And it's done.' And when he is called weak, wimpish and
indecisive again, as he will be, it will have less sting.''
   The president often has referred to himself as a cautious man.
Against the backdrop of this caution, therefore, the bold Panama
strike stands out in even greater relief, political analysts said.
   But Bush himself, while clearly savoring the praise and happy
with the success of the operation, offers a more cynical assessment
of how Democrats in Congress will react once the initial glow has
faded.
   At Friday's news conference, he was asked: ``Is this the last
time George Mitchell can ever accuse you of having a timid foreign
policy?''
   Bush: ``Knowing George, he'll find a reason, he'll find a way.
And that's his job. Look, we're going into an election year.''

<HEAD>Greek Communists Change Stand and Denounce 1968 Czechoslovak
Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Greek Communist Party, in a policy
reversal, has denounced the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed
Czechoslovakia's reform movement in 1968, the party's newspaper
said Saturday.
   The policy reversal comes at a time when communism has been
discredited by popular uprisings throughout Eastern Europe.
Hard-line Communist regimes have fallen in Czechoslovakia, Poland,
East Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania.
   The Greek party's Central Committee also supported political
reforms initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has
given the countries in the Soviet bloc new freedom to determine
their own political destinies.
   The party's initial decision to support the Warsaw Pact invasion
caused some members to leave the organization and to form the Greek
Left Party.
   The policy reversal could heal that rift and lead the two
parties to merge.
   Last year, they cooperated in Greece's general elections under
the banner of the Coalition of the Left and Progress.
   The coalition emerged as the power broker when the vote ended
inconclusively. An all-party government was eventually formed to
govern until new elections later this year.
   The party said it reversed its decision because it decided that
while many East bloc nations deviated from orthodox socialism
during the Cold War, that ``can be justified by the diverse styles
of regimes that governed'' those countries, according to the party
newspaper, Rizospastis.

   Cindy Barton lighted her second
cigarette of the lunch hour and sneered at the ``Non-Smoking
Section'' sign just across the room at Donnie's, a downtown
restaurant.
   ``I think it's stupid. It's a joke,'' she said about the city's
new smoking regulations, the toughest in the nation's No. 1 tobacco
state. ``It was passed by a lot of hypocritical goody-goody two
shoes who are no better than anybody else.''
   Her co-worker, Sheila Atkins, agreed.
   ``The government cracks down on little bitty things that don't
amount to a hill of beans,'' said Ms. Atkins, who said she smokes
five cigarettes during lunch. ``It just irks me.''
   Two tables away, Joseph Bernstein was enjoying a cigarette with
his coffee and newspaper. Unlike his fellow diners, the
restrictions didn't seem to bother him.
   ``I think it's a give-and-take thing,'' he said. ``I think it
will work out.''
   The smoking rules went into effect on New Year's Day in this
city of nearly 200,000 people located in the heart of North
Carolina tobacco country.
   Despite vocal opposition from the tobacco industry, the
controversial measure passed by a slim 173-vote margin out of
nearly 30,000 cast in a November referendum.
   Meetings have since been held between city officials and
business owners so there would be no surprises. Many restaurants
and retail stores already were complying with the restrictions,
said city spokesman Jack Gardner.
   ``A lot of them were glad they didn't have to alienate their
customers _ we were,'' he said.
   While Greensboro doesn't rank up there with tobacco towns such
as Winston-Salem or Durham, it is the home of Lorillard Inc., which
makes Newport, Kent and True cigarettes and employs 2,300 people.
   North Carolina produces about two-thirds of the nation's
flue-cured tobacco, which is used to make cigarettes.
   With 14,000 tobacco farmers, the state's annual crop is valued
at $900 million. North Carolina's cigarette manufacturers produce
about 56 percent of all domestic brands.
   ``If this was Indiana or some other state where tobacco isn't
grown there would be far less criticism,'' said Gardner.
   The ordinance bans smoking in elevators and grocery and
department stores and requires restaurants seating 50 or more to
set aside at least 25 percent for non-smokers.
   Customers who ignore the warnings can be fined $25, after a
one-year grace period. The grace period doesn't apply to
businesses, which can be fined immediately for failing to post the
no-smoking signs or asking a customer to extinguish a lighted
cigarette.
   ``We have a whole year to figure out how to enforce it,'' said
Gardner. ``We won't be going into restaurants and shops looking for
violators.''
   Mary Lacklen, president of the 75-member Guilford County
Restaurant Association, said most restaurant owners prefer a
voluntary program.
   ``Since it's not (voluntary) we've taken it upon ourselves to
educate our members so the transition can be smooth,'' she said.
   Mrs. Lacklen owns Bert's Seafood Grill, which seats 52.
   ``Before this ordinance we had already set aside 70 percent of
our seats for non-smokers because of customer demand,'' she said.
   At Woolworth's, shoppers were greeted by large ``No Smoking''
signs at the door. Outside, the sidewalk was littered with dozens
of crushed cigarette butts.
   Inside, part of the lunch counter that was desegregated by
blacks during the 1961 civil rights ``sit-ins'' was set aside for
non-smokers.
   Robert T. Taylor, who ate a sandwich while sitting at one of the
four non-smoking tables at Donnie's, likes the new restrictions.
   ``After a while it will become second nature, just like
integration,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Saturday
the U.S. invasion of Panama should not be viewed as heralding a new
``Bush doctrine'' under which the United States would be inclined
to intervene militarily in other countries where democratic
elections are subverted.
   Interviewed on Cable News Network's ``Evans and Novak'' program,
Cheney was asked specifically about what the United States would do
if elections scheduled for February in Nicaragua are ``stolen'' by
the ruling Sandinista regime.
   Cheney responded that the Panama action ``is not the beginning
of the new Bush doctrine, where under every circumstance we would
always use military force to intervene in order to enforce, if you
will, the outcome of a free electoral process.''
   Under further questioning about Nicaragua, the Pentagon chief
said ``I think as a general proposition we always reserve all of
our options when we look down the road. But at this point, I would
not want to indicate that we plan to use force there.''
   ``Our hope is that there will, in fact, be a fair election and
that the outcome of the election will be honored by the current
government of Nicaragua,'' he said.
   Cheney said there were ``different circumstances'' in Panama _
including the U.S. right to be in Panama under the canal treaties,
the killing of an American Marine and harassment of other
servicemen by the Panama Defense Forces, and President Bush's
obligation to protect the lives of thousands of Americans living in
Panama.
   He said the United States used military force in Panama ``very
reluctantly. We exhausted all other options ... to try to deal with
that situation and finally moved only when it was clear that
American lives, American interests were, in fact, in jeopardy.''
   Cheney said that judging by the ``huge quantity'' of weapons
found in caches in Panama, it was ``reasonable speculation'' that
former strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was involved in the
international arms trade.
   ``When I was there right after the operation, I visited several
of the sites that, at that time, we thought had maybe 30,000 or
40,000 weapons. Now it looks like 75,000. We have one report that
may take it as high as 100,000,'' he said.
   Cheney noted that ``for a military force of some 4,500 people it
doesn't make any sense at all to have weapons of that magnitude.''

   Nicolae Ceausescu ruled Romania with an iron hand for 24 years,
scorning the changes swirling around him in Eastern Europe. But in
four, swift December days he was brought down by a revolution,
hunted, captured, imprisoned in an armored car, tried and executed
by a firing squad.
   He liked to cast himself as the hero of a Romanian epic, and at
the end he defiantly told the prosecutor at his summary trial: ``I
am the president of Romania and the commander in chief of the armed
forces.''
   His power crumbled so quickly he couldn't even flee the country.
And the soldiers he once commanded drew lots for the honor of
shooting him.
   Of Ceausescu's heroic plans for himself and Romania, only one
wish came true: he was granted a request to die together with his
wife.
   Ceausescu had a huge security apparatus, with legions of
specially trained, fiercely loyal troops, a secret tunnel network
under his capital of Bucharest, and seemingly endless resources for
his own protection. But unrest that started Dec. 15 in the western
city of Timisoara sparked a national revolt against the hardship
and terror of his reign.
   Hundreds were reported massacred in Timisoara Dec. 17 by the
security police. Ceausescu, apparently confident he could ride out
this protest, left for a three-day state visit to Iran.
   He returned on afternoon of Dec. 20, greeted as usual at the
airport by chanting crowds and children with bouquets.
   Then Ceausescu began to blunder. He went on television and
denounced the Timisoara protesters as ``hooligans.'' By Dec. 21,
disorder began to move to Bucharest, largely as a result of a
miscalculation by the 71-year-old Ceausescu, who had shrewdly
survived other popular protests and even an attempted 1984 coup.
   He held two rallies in Bucharest and faced shouts of protest at
both _ stunning occurrences for his tightly controlled state. At
the second rally, on Dec. 22, the leader was shouted down with
chants of ``Death! Death!'' Abandoning his palace, security forces,
secret tunnels and his own dignity, he fled Bucharest in
presidential helicopter No. 1, a sleek white craft with a range of
600 miles.
   No one can be certain what Ceausescu's precise plans were.
Apparently, he and Elena were bent on fleeing the country, but it
is not clear where he might have expected asylum.
   Silviu Brucan, a senior member of the National Salvation Front
now running Romania, told the French newspaper Le Monde that
Ceausescu was headed for ``a North African country,'' possibly
Libya. Other reports mentioned China.
   From accounts of his flight from Bucharest, the escape was
frantic and confused. The helicopter's pilot, Vasile Malutan, told
the newspaper Romania Libera he desperately radioed for
instructions while one of Ceausescu's bodyguards pointed a gun at
his head throughout the flight.
   Ceausescu's trusted adviser, Emil Bobu, and Maria Manescu, wife
of another confidant, were the only leading figures who accompanied
the Ceausescus on the flight, which was so cramped the co-pilot had
to sit on the dictator's knees.
   The craft headed for Snagov, a village north of Bucharest where
Ceausescu had a summer residence. Bobu and Mrs. Manescu left there.
She kissed the president's hands.
   From Snagov, the helicopter flew to a military airport at
Boteni, northwest of Bucharest. Ceausescu, apparently fearful of
being shot out of the air or falling into rebel army hands at an
airport, ordered Malutan to land away from any airfield.
   According to one account from Brucan, published in the Financial
Times, Ceausescu was surrounded by peasants as soon as he landed
and was handed over to the army.
   But in a later account, the deputy interior minister, Col. Gen.
Jean Moldoveanu, said Ceausescu's bodyguards hijacked a private car
for the couple, who sped off. Two traffic police recognized
Ceausescu at a checkpoint.
   They caught up with the Ceausescus at a factory in Cimpulung, a
town at the foot of the Carpathian Alps, some 100 miles northwest
of Bucharest, Moldoveanu told the newspaper Adevarul. He said the
couple was alone.
   The two policemen planned to surrender their prisoners to the
army. But, as they drove south toward Tirgoviste, 40 miles
northwest of Bucharest, citizens tried to stop the car, believing
the policemen wanted to escape with the Ceausescus, Moldoveanu said.
   After a dramatic chase through Tirgoviste, the two policemen
managed to outfox the pursuing citizens and drove to a wood, where
they covered the car with tree branches and leaves and stayed until
dark.
   Moldoveanu said they took the Ceausescus to a military base near
Tirgoviste where they were put under heavy guard.
   ``Several hours after their capture, the base was attacked from
land and air (by pro-Ceausescu security forces), but the military
there knew how to defend themselves and their prisoners,''
Moldoveanu said.
   Soldiers put the Ceausescus in an armored car that was kept on
the move for nearly three days to prevent the Securitate, or secret
police, from discovering their whereabouts, Maj. Mihai Lupoi later
told British television.
   Ceausescu suffered from diabetes but refused to take insulin
during his detention, Lupoi said.
   Lupoi, who was appointed tourism minister for his role in the
revolution, said the armored car was the one that delivered
Ceausescu to the secret military tribunal that sentenced the
dictator to death.
   On television, Romanians saw Ceausescu as he struggled in
ungainly fashion out of the armored vehicle, losing his Astrakhan
hat.
   They saw a doctor test the fallen leader's blood pressure, and
then saw the dictator and his wife, in scarf and thick light brown
coat, defiantly answering their unseen military accusers. The
charge against Ceausescu and his wife, his second-in-command, was
the genocide of 60,000 people during their years in power.
   ``I'm not guilty! I'm not guilty! I will answer only in front of
the Grand National Assembly (parliament) and in front of the
working class. These are lies!'' Ceausescu yelled near the end of
the summary trial. ``I don't recognize this court!''
   At the end, Ceausescu interrupted a prosecutor who addressed him
simply as defendant.
   ``I am not a defendant, I am the president of Romania and the
commander in chief of the armed forces, and I want to answer before
the Grand National Assembly.''
   The prosecutor replied, ``I have nothing to discuss with you.''
When Ceausescu again tried to interrupt, he was told sternly, ``The
sentence cannot be appealed.''
   Romanians did not see the Christmas Day execution. The videotape
closed with a shot of the couple's bodies, crumpled close together
beneath a bullet-shattered wall.
   Later accounts said so many soldiers wanted to be in the firing
squad that a lottery was held among 300 volunteers. When the ruling
couple walked toward their end, the soldiers barely waited for the
order before opening fire.
   The accounts said the couple's last wish was to die together.
And so they did, riddled with 90 bullets at a military base outside
Tirgoviste.
   The people's last glimpse of the fallen Ceausescu was a close-up
of his face, eyes open, the right side of his head stained with
blood.
   The couple's burial place remains unknown. Most likely, the
leaders that executed the couple buried them secretly near where
they died, thus preventing either desecration of the grave by angry
Romanians or an attempt by security men to recover the bodies.

   More than 2,000 law-enforcement officers sealed
off the area surrounding the state Capitol this morning and
maintained order as about 50 white supremacists and 100
counterdemonstrators rallied.
   The Klan-led rally ended without any confrontations after about
75 minutes. However, a shouting match broke out as Klansmen
returned to their cars. Counterdemonstrators a half-block away
began jeering and the supremacists responded with shouts and
Nazi-style salutes.
   As a Klan motorcade left the Capitol area, counterdemonstrators
burned a figure made of sheets as a Ku Klux Klan effigy.
   Officials said 1,594 Georgia National Guardsmen, 300 Atlanta
police officers, 184 state troopers and 145 agents from the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation were present during the rally, separating
the Klan contingent from about two dozen counterdemonstrators who
marched two blocks away.
   About 30 of the white supremacists were dressed in white Klan
robes, while others wore camouflage fatigues or pseudo-Nazi garb.
   Chants from the counterdemonstrators and the rumble of police
and television helicopters drowned out the Klan.
   Randall W. Smith, grand dragon of the Southern White Knights of
the KKK, said that considering the violence tht erupted during
demonstrations the last two years, the Klan welcomed the security.
   ``We'd rather they keep them out. We really appreciate the
security,'' Smith said.
   Civil rights leaders had urged blacks to stay away from the
rally, which was organized by the Southern White Knights of the
KKK. It was to be followed by an afternoon rally in Forsyth County,
the virtually all-white county north of Atlanta where ``brotherhood
marchers'' were pelted with rocks in 1987, prompting a second march
by 20,000 civil rights supporters.
   The Ad Hoc Committee Against the Klan called this week for
counterdemonstrators to gather nearby in opposition to the Klan.
   Several civil-rights leaders endorsed a less confrontational
approach, an ``ecumenical prayer vigil for peace'' at the Martin
Luther King Jr. International Chapter on the campus of Morehouse
College, several miles from the Capitol.
   Among those supporting the vigil were Southern Christian
Leadership Conference President Joseph E. Lowery and the
southeastern regional director of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, Earl Shinhoster.
   ``The best reception for (racist) hate groups is empty streets
and churches full of blacks and whites in prayer,'' Lowery said.
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a longtime Atlanta civil rights leader,
called on blacks to stay away from the Klan.
   ``The Klan represents the past, not the future,'' Lewis said.
``They represent the dark, not the light. Ignore this group, leave
them to themselves and allow law enforcement officials to take care
of the matter.''
   Last January, a white supremacist rally and march in downtown
Atlanta turned violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators
gathered to oppose a handful of white protesters.
   Racial tensions have been heightened in the Southeast recently
by the mail-bomb killings of Robert Vance, an Alabama judge on the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Atlanta, and Robert
Robinson, a Savannah attorney.
   A letter written after the bombings indicated they were racially
motivated and said others would follow.

<HEAD>Iran Dismisses Iraq Plan for Talks as Iraq Displays Military Might</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICK LUDINGTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran dismissed an Iraqi proposal for
reviving peace talks between the two countries as ``a new campaign
of public deception,'' Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Saturday.
   The dispatch, monitored in Cyprus, said Iraq's three-point plan
offered Friday only reworded previous Iraqi demands. Talks on a
permanent end to the eight-year conflict have been stalemated since
a cease-fire in August 1988.
   The announcement came as Iraq displayed new weaponry, including
Iraqi-built missiles, during its annual Army Day.
   Iran did not reject President Saddam Hussein's offer outright
but described it as ``a new campaign of public deception to
undermine (U.N. Security Council) Resolution 598,'' the cease-fire
resolution.
   ``In fact, Saddam reiterated Iraq's previous proposals that were
extraneous to the resolution, only giving them a new wrapping,'' it
said.
   Resolution 598, adopted in July 1987, calls for a cease-fire,
withdrawal of troops to pre-war borders, the repatriation of
prisoners of war, and settlement of the conflict through
negotiations.
   It noted that Saddam failed to address simultaneous withdrawals
of troops and repatriation of POWs, key Iranian demands for
progress in the talks.
   Iran claims Iraq holds 1,065 square miles of its territory. But
United Nations experts say the Iraqis occupy only 260 square miles.
   Both sides blame each other for the deadlock in negotiations.
The last session was held in April, and U.N. efforts to revive the
negotiations have foundered.
   Saddam proposed a direct dialogue between the Iranian and Iraqi
leaderships be held alternately in Baghdad and Tehran under U.N.
supervision.
   He suggested exchanging all ailing and disabled POWs and
prisoners who have been detained since the early days of the
conflict, which broke out in September 1980.
   His proposal called for opening offices for the two countries'
national airlines in the capitals and reviving air links, which
were cut shortly before the war began. It said this would provide
an atmopshere of peace that would help push efforts for a
settlement.
   The parade marking Iraq's Army Day underlined Saddam's policy of
building up Iraq's military capabilities until Tehran signs a peace
treaty to formally end the war.
   With both sides devastated by the war, most analysts do not
believe there is much likelihood the conflict will erupt again.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 in Iraqi camps. But U.N. officials and diplomats say there
are at least 100,000 POWs.
   The Red Cross mediated an agreement to repatriate the ailing and
crippled POWs immediately after the cease-fire. But the accord
broke down after the release of only 400 prisoners with both sides
accusing each other of falsifying the number of captives who were
seeking asylum.
   The Red Cross estimates 1,000 ailing or disabled POWs are still
held by both sides.
   Iraq has demanded that a new border accord be worked out, giving
it total control of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. It also has
insisted on an agreement for clearing the channel of debris.
   Under a 1975 accord, the border between the two countries ran
down the middle of Shatt-al-Arab, which is Iraq's main outlet to
the sea.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist Party on Saturday
proposed that both Germanys cut their armies in half this year,
seek the withdrawal of all U.S. and Soviet troops by 1999 and
discard their chemical weapons.
   In West Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party called for a new
European security force independent of Moscow and Washington,
reflecting the growing sentiment among Germans for a united and
neutral Europe.
   The moves position the dominant parties in both Germanys for
election campaigns focusing on how to balance German unity with
European fears of a new military threat rising on the continent.
   East Germany's Communist Party leader, Gregor Gysi, laid out a
detailed plan for drastic troop and arms reductions at a special
meeting of the party leadership, according to the official ADN news
agency.
   Gysi said both the West German Bundeswehr and the East German
Volksarmee should be cut in half by 1991, thereby lending
credibility to promises that a united Germany would pose no threat
to European neighbors.
   The Communists oppose formal reunification of Germany, but they
have agreed to seek a ``treaty community'' that would give a more
formal basis to relations with West Germany and possibly result in
a German confederation.
   ``Both German states must begin the demilitarization of Central
Europe and fix their treaty community with a cooperative security
policy,'' Gysi said.
   East Germany's Defense Ministry on Thursday announced it was
cutting the compulsory army service term from 18 months to 12
months, and Gysi urged Bonn to take similar action.
   He also proposed that both nations pull back any defense
installations within 30 to 50 miles of the inter-German border.
   Arms production should be ``considerably reduced,'' and chemical
weapons should be removed from both states by 1991, Gysi contended
in his disarmament program titled ``Model for Security 2000.''
   It also calls for all arms modernization to be halted and for
both sides to refrain from selling weapons outside their military
alliances.
   Under the proposal, all foreign troops would be removed from
Germany by 1999.
   West Germany's army of 480,000 is backed by about 250,000 U.S.
troops, while the East German force of 170,000 is reinforced by
400,000 Soviet soldiers.
   Leading defense officials of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union
unveiled a new West German military strategy in interviews with the
Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag.
   The newspaper distributed its report to news agencies ahead of
Sunday publication.
   Military policy expert Otto Hauser was quoted by the newspaper
as saying that a united Europe requires ``new concepts'' in
defense, and that reduction of the West German compulsory service
term should not be ruled out.
   Kohl and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg have made plans
for reorganizing West Germany's military structure, which they
expect to begin putting into force after a conventional arms
agreement is reached between NATO and the Warsaw Pact at
negotiations in Vienna, the newspaper said.
   Asked about the newspaper report, Defense Ministry spokesman
Winfried Dunkel in Bonn refused to say what changes West Germany
might consider in the wake of a Vienna agreement, expected this
summer.
   The parliamentary defense policy expert from Kohl's party, Bernd
Wilz, urged the ``European parts'' of NATO and the Warsaw Pact to
realign themselves into a European security force independent of
the superpowers.
   ``Our answer to Moscow's security considerations is a new
European peace order whose freedom, peacefulness and stability
would be guaranteed by a new European Security Union,'' Wilz told
the newspaper.
   As the postwar divisions in Europe have been mending in the wake
of Eastern Europe's turn toward democracy, defense experts have
predicted that the two military blocs eventually will be dissolved.
   Germans in both states have expressed strong support for ending
the East-West division of Europe that has separated them into rival
political blocs for four decades.
   The defense proposals were announced by the two German states
almost simultaneously, but there was no indication that either the
Communists in East Germany or Kohl's party had consulted with the
other state.
   East Germans vote May 6 in the first free, competitive and
secret elections in the nation's 40-year history, and the issues of
German unity and European security are high on the campaign agenda.
   Cutting defense spending would free up state funds that could be
devoted to upgrading industry and improving the provision of basic
goods and services to the nation of 16 million, which is mired in
economic crisis.
   In West Germany, Kohl's party holds a slight lead over the
opposition Social Democrats in polls conducted since the Berlin
Wall opened Nov. 9 and relations between the Germanys began
warming. West German elections are scheduled for December.

   Sudanese rebels said Saturday they killed
250 government troops during six days of fighting.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said in a radio
broadcast that rebels chased fleeing government soldiers to the
Ugandan border but stopped there ``out of respect for the
international border.''
   On Friday, the Sudanese rebels claimed they had dispersed an
army brigade of more than 3,000 soldiers in the south region of
Equatoria.
   There is no way to independently confirm rebel and army claims
of victories in the nearly 7-year-old civil war in the south.
   The SPLA took up arms against the government in the spring of
1983. They want more autonomy and economic reforms.

   Court squabbles between Washington Redskins
owner Jack Kent Cooke and his ex-wife took a new twist when Suzanne
Martin Cooke asked $140,000 a year support for their nearly
2-year-old daughter, Jacqueline.
   ``I find this proposal abhorrent!'' Cooke replied during a
child-support hearing Friday in Fauquier County, Va., Circuit Court.
   Mrs. Cooke, 33, asked for $1,650 a month for vacations for the
child, among other things.
   ``This is an average monthly expense?'' asked Cooke's attorney,
Milton S. Gould. ``Twenty-thousand dollars a year? ... Is this a
fair amount for a 2-year-old child?''
   ``I think it's important that Jacqueline be brought up in an
environment with other children of her own stature, yes,'' Suzanne
Cook replied.
   Looking at her ex-husband, she added, ``She'll be 2 years old on
January 25, in case you've forgotten her birthday.''
   Other expenses included in the request were $600 a month for
clothing, $1,390 monthly for baby sitting and a nanny, $375 for
restaurants, and the purchase of a $650,000 farm. Her lawyer,
Rodney Page, argued that Cooke be required to pay extra each month
because at 77 he ``may not be around to pay this support.''
   The Cookes separated a month after their July 1987 wedding when
Mrs. Cooke refused to go through with an agreed-upon abortion.
   The Redskins owner's attorney argued that Suzanne Cooke intended
all along to use the baby to obtain a fortune from Cooke, estimated
by Forbes magazine to be worth $1.25 billion.
   A new court date was set Jan. 16.

   A plane piloted by actor James
Brolin crashed and burned during takeoff, but Brolin escaped
without injury.
   A strong gust of wind on Friday afternoon blew the plane off the
runway and down an embankment, said Sgt. Ernie Roop of the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
   Brolin, 49, escaped ``moments before the plane burst into
flames,'' Roop said.
   He was alone in the four-seat Cessna 182 when the accident
occurred at Agua Dulce Airport in Saugus, 33 miles northwest of Los
Angeles. The plane was destroyed by fire.
   Brolin was known for his role as the apprentice to Robert Young
in the prime-time television series, ``Marcus Welby M.D.'' He won
an Emmy Award in 1970 for the role.
   He also starred in the television drama ``Hotel'' and has
appeared in several films, including ``Pee Wee's Big Adventure''
and ``The Amityville Horror.''

   Thomas F. Wilson had never been in a movie
before ``Back to the Future,'' so auditioning for executive
producer Steven Spielberg brought on ``utter mind-bending fear,''
he said.
   Wilson had been in television and commercials before he landed
the role of Biff Tannen, who bullies Michael J. Fox's character,
Marty McFly, in the original movie, its current sequel and next
year's third episode.
   Wilson was ``ready to pass out'' at his final audition, he said
in an interview published Friday in The New York Times.
   ``I thought I had destroyed the reading. It was the scene where
I was bullying Crispin Glover,'' he said, referring to the actor
who played McFly's father in the original.
   He was asked to ``show us some bully stuff.''
   ``I just threw Crispin all around the room,'' Wilson said. ``But
with all this physicality, I lost my way in the scene. I started
improvising. I lost my place. ...
   ``I really thought I had blown it. It was a long night of me
staying in a fetal position in a corner of my room.''
   When his agent called the next day to say he got the part, he
said he let out a ``blood-curdling scream.''
   In next year's movie, he'll play Biff's great-great-grandfather,
gunslinger Buford Tannen. ``If you thought Biff was bad, this guy's
horrible. He woke up on the wrong side of the globe.''

   The mother of the man profiled in the new

   However, her son's portrayal by Tom Cruise was right on target,
she said.
   Pat Kovic, mother of Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic, an activist
whose book is the basis for the Oliver Stone-directed movie, said
her character, played by actress Carolyn Kova, is presented as the
villain.
   ``I just don't like the words that were put in my mouth. He
(Stone) made me out to be a religious fanatic,'' she said. ``I'm
religious. God is very important to me, but I'm not a fanatic. I'm
really a very nice person. Ask all my friends.''
   Mrs. Kovic said she has accepted the film the way it is and just
hopes it doesn't affect the opinions of her held by people she
knows.
   ``It's a movie,'' said her husband, Tom Kovic. ``I don't think
you get 100 percent accuracy.''
   The Kovics raised their children in Massapequa, N.Y., and moved
to Yuma five years ago.

   Residents of the close-knit, Catholic
neighborhood where Charles Stuart grew up say they knew him well,
the way everyone knows each other in a working class, church-going
community. Now they're not so sure.
   ``It's like something out of a bad detective novel,'' said Steve
Reardon, Stuart's cousin who runs a family-owned, downtown
restaurant where Stuart and his three brothers worked when they
were younger.
   Stuart, 29, killed himself Thursday by jumping off a Boston
Harbor bridge after his youngest brother implicated him in his own
shooting and the fatal shooting of his pregnant wife, Carol.
   Stuart had told police they were shot by an assailant after they
left a childbirth class at a Boston hospital last Oct. 23. The baby
was born prematurely and died 17 days later. Police now say
Stuart's story isn't true.
   ``How could someone like Carol, with the character and
reputation that she had, have gotten involved with Chuck if Chuck
had been the madman it looks like he may have been,'' Reardon said.
``You just don't know what goes on behind closed doors. It all
looked so good on the outside.''
   But almost immediately after the shootings, the rumors began:
that Stuart had drug problems; that he was hoping to cash in on
life insurance policies on his wife; that he was not the father of
the infant.
   Police are investigating the life insurance angle, but so far
they know only that he collected $82,000 on a policy from his
wife's job as a lawyer. Investigators also have ordered tests to
check the baby's parentage.
   But checks so far show no criminal background, no confirmed link
with drugs, and no evidence Stuart was anything but the way friends
and police had come to see him: a nice guy.
   ``Never, ever did I get a tip to suspect Charles Stuart,'' said
John Dawley, the Stuart family attorney who represented Charles
until he became a suspect. ``The guy was a remarkable guy, and I
don't say that lightly. I say it in light of everthing I know.''
   There are still only hints of a darker side.
   ``Nothing was substantiated. I think there were a number of
people who had a knowledge that something was amiss,'' said Acting
Police Chief James Russo in Revere, north of Boston. ``As far as
him being squeaky clean, I can't say that. But I don't want to add
further to the burden of the family.''
   Stuart was one of four vigorous, athletic brothers in an active
family.
   His father, Charles Stuart Sr., was the one people called when
they needed a toastmaster at the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic
men's group. He and his wife, Dot, raised six children, two
daughters from Stuart's first marriage, and their four sons,
Charles Jr., Michael, Mark and Matthew.
   ``I heard the rumors, and I just said `that can't be,''' said
Joanne Bogus, who lives two doors from the Stuart family's red
shingle house. It is just around the corner from the construction
site for a new Immaculate Conception Roman Catholic Church,
attended by the Stuarts and most neighbors.
   ``I've been living here for 14 years. My son was a little
younger than the four Stuart boys, but Chuckie and the others would
always be out there playing with the kids, street hockey,
basketball, baseball, you name it. This is just too hard to
understand,'' she said.
   Maureen and John Vajdic, neighbors of the Stuarts in Reading, 13
miles northwest of Boston, said the couple seemed happy, and they
saw nothing untoward when they were in the house after the
shootings to care for the couple's two black retriever dogs. But
Mrs. Vajdic said Mrs. Stuart had once asked if she heard a loud
argument late one night after Stuart came home.
   Ted Kakas, one of the owners of the fur store that Stuart
managed on the posh Newbury Street in Boston's Back Bay, said:
``There's nobody in this store of 50 employees who isn't blown away
by this.''
   One of the few glimpses of a possible other side of Chuck Stuart
comes in reviewing his accounts of his college days. He told others
he went to Brown University to play football and then to Salem
State college. College officials at Brown say there is no trace of
him; he only briefly attended Salem State.
   ``You see these stories on the television news, you analyze them
and then forget about it. But then something like this happens,
where you know the people, it just leaves you wondering,'' said
Wayne Berry, a bartender at Reardon's.

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former telephone technician testified that
he put a wiretap on the home telephone of Charles H. Keating Jr.,
the central figure in a $2 billion savings and loan failure.
   Robert Draise, a former technician for Cincinnati Bell, said the
company's former security chief gave him radio transmitters to
attach to Keating's home phone in the 1970s. Keating was then a
Cincinnati businessman and founder of the anti-pornography group
Citizens for Decent Literature.
   Keating, now a Phoenix millionaire, is the former owner of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif. The
government seized Lincoln in April, and filed a $1.1 billion fraud
and racketeering civil suit against Keating charging he operated
Lincoln for his own and his family's benefit. Keating denies the
charges and is challenging the seizure.
   Draise's testimony Friday came during the trial of a defamation
suit filed by Cincinnati Bell in Hamilton County Common Pleas
Court. Draise and another former Bell employee claim to have
performed hundreds of illegal wiretaps between the early 1970s and
1984 ordered by police and Bell security officers.
   ``I know what I did. I did the wiretaps. I did them for Jerry
Berry. I did them for Pete Gabor. I even did one for myself,''
Draise testified.
   Jerry Berry is a former sergeant in the Cincinnati Police
intelligence squad. He and other former officers have admitted
using Draise and Leonard Gates on some illegal wiretaps in the
early 1970s.
   Peter Gabor is a Bell manager who headed the company's security
section in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He and James West are
the Bell security officers Gates and Draise claim ordered many of
the alleged taps.
   The phone company, West and Gabor deny knowing about or
participating in any illegal taps, and have sued Gates and Draise
for defamation. Gates and Draise countersued, claiming they were
injured by being called liars.
   The illegal wiretaps began in the early 1970s, Draise said.
Draise said he agreed to Berry's request to perform taps against
criminal suspects and alleged subversives. He said Berry told him
the taps had been cleared with Bell security and continued
installing them for several years.
   Draise said he was installing a phone at Keating's house when
Gabor telephoned him. ``He said he understood I had done some very
good work for Jerry Berry,'' Draise said.
   Gabor came to Keating's house and gave Draise two radio
transmitters to attach to Keating's lines, Draise said. The reason
for installing the transmitters or who was listening to them was
not stated.
   Draise said he believed the Keating wiretap was done in 1976.

   Tony Noriega says he doesn't mind
sharing his name with the deposed dictator of Panama. In fact, he
enjoys the coincidence.
   He donned camouflage clothing last month and struck a
clenched-fist pose that made him look just like Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega for a hometown newspaper, the Tri-City Times. To some
co-workers at General Motors Corp., Noriega said he was the
dictator's big brother.
   ``They didn't know how old he was. I said `He's 36 ... He's my
younger brother,' and I walked away real fast,'' Noriega said
Friday.
   Tony Noriega, 46, was born in Mexico and has lived in Imlay City
for 25 years. He says to his knowledge, he is no relation to the
alleged drug-runner who surrendered to U.S. troops outside the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City Wednesday.
   A year of heavy Noriega-bashing by U.S. leaders hasn't bothered
Michigan's Noriega. ``I'm having a lot of fun with it,'' he said.
``I have a very flexible personality.''
   Noriega's humor befuddles a few. ``Some people don't know what
to make of it,'' he said. ``They get very reserved, very far away.''
   The parodies end as soon as Noriega, a staunch Republican, talks
politics. This is one Noriega who supported the U.S. invasion of
Panama.
   There have been no open hostilities, though, Noriega said. ``I
don't let it get to that,'' he said.
   His kids seem to enjoy the attention and even attract it,
Noriega said. When the family went out to dinner Thursday, the day
of Gen. Noriega's arraignment on federal drug charges in Miami, one
of the girls couldn't stop giggling at the Noriega discussions
going on at the next table.
   Finally the family had to tell people why they were laughing.
``Now you can say you've served the Noriega family,'' he told the
waitress.
   The notoriety has its benefits, said his wife, Becky Noriega.
   ``Before, I always had to spell my name,'' she said. ``Now I
don't have to. Everyone knows.''

<HEAD>Birthplace of National Anthem Rallies to Its Defense</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Oh say, can you sing the national anthem?
   Most people can't, says a congressman from Indiana who wants to
scrap ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as the nation's official song in
favor of the less straining ``America the Beautiful.''
   Rep. Andrew Jacobs also says the poem penned by Francis Scott
Key after American troops repelled British forces at Baltimore's
Fort McHenry in 1814 is unsuitable because it celebrates war and
because the tune's origin is an old drinking song _ and an English
one, to boot.
   Jacobs' introduction of a bill to make the change, though
nothing new, has provoked a spirited defense.
   ``Who says you can't sing it?'' demanded Maryland Historical
Society spokeswoman Darlene Frank.
   The society held a contest in September to commemorate the 175th
anniversary of the writing of the anthem and found ``more than 300
patriotic Americans who loved the song enough to want to sing it in
public ... and a capella, no less,'' Frank wrote in a letter
dismissing Jacob's proposal.
   The Democrat has introduced the bill nine times in 12 years,
without gaining any appreciable support.
   ``It's not a burning issue in my existence,'' Jacobs said.
   Still, he does not plan to forego the campaign. ``America the
Beautiful'' is gradually eclipsing ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' as
the song of choice at official functions, he said.
   In Maryland, Gov. William Donald Schaefer has asked the state's
congressional delegation to oppose Jacobs' bill. The Frederick,
Md., Keys, a minor league baseball team named for the composer,
also opposes the change.
   Karen Stuart, head librarian at the Maryland Historical Society,
said the latest attempt to replace the anthem has prompted more
outcry that in the past.
   The public may be more sensitive because of the emphasis on the
Pledge of Allegiance during the 1988 presidential campaign and the
Supreme Court's ruling last summer that the burning of the flag is
a protected form of free speech.
   Key wrote the anthem to commemorate the defense of Fort McHenry,
where citizen soldiers withstood 25 hours of bombardment from
British ships during the War of 1812.
   Key almost certainly took some poetic liberties in his most
famous verse. Historians say it is unlikely he saw the flag
``gallantly streaming'' because it would have been soggy after a
night of pounding rain. And Stuart said some scholars question
whether the rockets' red glare was sufficient to illuminate the
banner through the smoke and mist from as far away as the truce
ship which Key was aboard.
   Flawed or not, ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' enjoyed immediate
popularity in the young nation. The melody was ``To Anacreon in
Heaven,'' the slightly bawdy theme song of a private men's club in
London. The tune became well-known on both sides of the Atlantic
but didn't get official recognition until 1931.
   Its rival _ the tribute to spacious skies and amber waves of
grain _ was written in the late 19th century by a Wellesley College
English literature professor, Katherine Lee Bates.
   Jacobs said he was impressed by the story of how Bates was
inspired to write ``America the Beautiful,'' not by an armed
conflict, but by the beauty she beheld from the peak of a Colorado
mountain.
   But neither song is Jacobs' personal favorite among patriotic
tunes.
   ``I like `This Land Is Your Land,''' he said.

<HEAD>Bulgarians Defy Gov't, Maintain Ethnic Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Bulgaria's Slavic majority
defied their government and kept up protests in at least four
cities Saturday to try to overturn new laws granting religious and
cultural freedom for ethnic Turks.
   ``Turks to Turkey!'' and ``Listen to the voice of the people!''
shouted at least 2,000 people outside Parliament in Sofia, the
capital. Demonstrations continued for a third day in the southern
town of Kardzhali and in the northern cities of Shumen and Razgrad.
   The Turkish government and a spokesman for the ethnic Turks said
the nationalistic protests, which have resulted in the country's
biggest work stoppages in more than four decades, were instigated
by Communist hard-liners opposed to the ouster of hard-line leaders
and the implementation of democratic reforms.
   Protesters are demanding that the new Communist leaders reverse
a decision Dec. 20 to allow ethnic Turks and Moslems to use their
own names and languages and to allow the practice of Moslem
religious rites without restrictions.
   Parliament President Stanko Todorov said late Friday that the
government would not reverse itself.
   Turkey on Saturday denounced the demonstrations and said it
supported the Bulgarian government. Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said the protests were organized by people still loyal to
ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov.
   Zhivkov, who was ousted Nov. 10, tried to forcibly assimilate
the ethnic Turks by giving them Bulgarian names, prohibiting them
from speaking Turkish in public and restricting their religious
rights.
   Nationalists among the majority Slavs fear the 1.5 million
ethnic Turkish minority is growing too fast in number and poses a
threat to the country.
   The protests continued despite government appeals for calm.
Todorov on Saturday went to Razgrad to meet with local officials in
an attempt to defuse the crisis.
   On Friday, protest strikes paralyzed Kardzhali, where nearly
half the 50,000 inhabitants are ethnic Turks. In nearby Haskovo,
25,000 people rallied Friday under such slogans as ``The Central
Committee sold out Bulgaria.''
   Protesters are demanding a nationwide referendum on the ethnic
question. A major rally was expected Sunday outside Parliament.
   Bulgaria drew world criticism last May after Zhivkov granted
passports to ethnic Turks and an estimated 320,000 emigrated to
Turkey, saying they feared persecution if they stayed in Bulgaria.
   Turkey closed its borders. About 50,000 Bulgarian Turks later
returned, complaining about lack of jobs and proper housing in
Turkey.
   Slav nationalists have been suspicious of the loyalties of the
Bulgarian Turks and ethnic Bulgarian Moslems, known as Pomaks,
since Bulgaria won independence in 1877 from the Ottoman Empire
after 500 years.

   Communist leaders on Saturday voted to
disband their crumbling party at a congress later this month and to
form a leftist party with a new name and platform that rejects 40
years of Communist slogans.
   The Communists, who last year surrendered control of the
government and lost their leading role in society, are hoping to
regain some credibility and hold onto what power and members they
still have by cutting ties to their past.
   ``The new party will be created with great effort,'' party
leader Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said in a speech concluding a party
Central Committee plenum. ``It will have a new structure and
program.''
   The first day of the three-day congress scheduled for Jan. 27
will be devoted to abolishing the Communist Party and the following
two days to forming a new party from its remnants, Politburo member
Leszek Miller said.
   After Hungary, Poland would become the second East bloc nation
to disband its Communist Party, which ruled for four decades until
ceding control to Solidarity. It would be another in a series of
historic changes that in the past year have changed everything from
Poland's name to its state-run economy.
   Party members will be polled before the congress on choices for
a new party name, Miller told the policy-making Central Committee
before it voted to recommend the changes to the party congress _
likely the Communists' last.
   The 230-member Central Committee was presented with a proposal
for the poll. It included six possible names and space for a
write-in nomination for a name to replace the Polish United Workers
Party, as the party is now called.
   The names being considered are the Socialist Party of Poland,
Socialist Party of Working People, Social Democratic Party of
Poland, Polish Party of Working People, Polish Party of the
Socialist Left and Polish Labor Party.
   ``A new party is needed referring to the hopes which working
people have in achieving leftist ideals,'' Miller said.
   An all-party poll conducted in September and presented to the
Central Committee Saturday indicated that 72 percent of those
queried favored transforming the party and adopting a new program
and name.
   ``The idea of a new party is not the result of nostalgia of past
importance. ... It is a consequence of the assessment that the
(party) cannot effectively meet the challenge of the new times,''
Miller said.
   In a draft declaration for a new program to be voted on at the
Congress, the party leaders rejected such Communist slogans as the
``dictatorship of the proletariat'' and ``collectivization'' and
said Stalinism was imposed from abroad and had nothing to do with
the roots of the Polish left.
   The declaration said the party believes the future of Poland
lies not with capitalism but with ``democratic socialism,'' which
it defined as ``freedom, democracy, social justice and solidarity.''
   The draft said the new party hopes to work with trade unions and
the left-wing of Solidarity and that it felt close to ecology and
peace movements.
   Following a precedent set at the last plenum, reporters were
allowed to attend the morning session.
   The sweeping victory of the Solidarity-led opposition in
elections last June sent the Communist Party scrambling for a new
identity.
   Blamed for Poland's crippled economy, the Communists' crisis
deepened last summer with the election of Solidarity editor Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, which ended more than 40 years of Communist control of
the government.
   Constitutional amendments adopted last month stripped the party
of its leading role in state affairs.
   At the beginning of 1980, the party claimed membership of 3
million. Now, membership has slipped to 2 million. Miller said 10
percent of the current members were not interested at all in
preparations for the congress.
   Party unity has dissolved in recent months, with some Communist
deputies in paRliament dropping out of the party caucus and with
other Communists threatening to split from the party.
   But Miller said the possibility of a serious conflict going into
the congress had subsided.
   ``We are going to the congress as a single party,'' he declared.
   He did not exclude the possibility of conflict at the congress,
however. ``Unity of the post-congress party is the `to be or not to
be' of the Polish left,'' he said.
   The congress is scheduled to last three days, with the first day
devoted to passing resolutions to end the party's activity, and the
following two days to the creation of a new party.

<HEAD>Stricken Tanker Heads Across Open Sea After Denied Haven</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A crippled Iranian tanker that spilled 19
million gallons of oil off the Moroccan coast was towed past the
Canary Islands Saturday in its search for calm seas to transfer its
remaining cargo.
   Cape Verde, Morocco, Portugal and Spain turned away the Khark 5,
which made an arc Saturday around the Canaries before heading south
across open seas.
   The salvage company Smit Tak, which is commanding the three tugs
towing the Khark 5, said it planned to take the 1,120-foot tanker
toward ``sheltered waters'' with little wind and less than two-foot
waves.
   The 53 million gallons of oil still estimated to be inside the
Khark 5 will then be transferred to a second Iranian tanker, said
Daan Kaakebeen, a spokesman for the Dutch salvage company.
   Smit Tak has been trying to find a haven for the Khark 5 since
an explosion ripped through the ship's hull Dec. 19 when it was 400
miles north of Las Palmas in Spain's Canary Islands.
   Morocco, 400 miles west, refused to let the tanker dock there,
and a 100-square-mile oil slick threatened Morocco's coastline.
Pollution experts said Thursday nearly all the oil had dissipated
and that there was no danger of an environmental disaster.
   Kaakebeen said Spain's decision to deny a request for the Khark
5 to perform the transfer of oil inside the 200-mile territorial
zone around the Canaries would delay the transfer by seven or eight
days.
   But he added that milder weather off Africa's Atlantic coast
lessened the possibility of new spills. The tanker's condition was
stable and it had not leaked crude since Wednesday, he said.
   ``As long as the ship is out in the open water with a cargo
there is always a percentage of danger that a heavy storm will
damage it,'' Kaakebeen said. ``But the weather is improving.''
   The ship was heading west around the Canaries on Saturday
morning, Kaakebeen said.
   The Spanish navy vessel Atrevida and the Punta Mayor, a Merchant
Marine tug equipped with floating barriers and chemical dispersants
were following the tanker, Merchant Marine officials said.
   In Cape Verde, a republic of 15 islands about 1,200 miles south
of the Canaries, Merchant Marine head Humberto Morais issued a
statement Thursday forbidding the Khark 5 from entering its waters.
   ``We won't accept this supertanker in Cape Verde for any
money,'' the state news agency Capopress quoted Morais as saying.

<HEAD>Newspaper Suggests Free Movement Across Iran-Soviet Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Tehran newspaper on Saturday
suggested opening the border between Iran's Azerbaijan province and
the Soviet Union to quell unrest in the region.
   The English-language Tehran Times said in an editorial: ``An
agreement on free border crossing between the two governments ...
will greatly help to alleviate the seething emotions of people who
wish to see their ancestral land and visit long-lost relatives.''
   Tehran radio said Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mahmoud Vaezi,
left for Moscow on Saturday to discuss ``bilateral relations'' with
Soviet officials.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, did not elaborate further
on the purpose of the visit.
   Excerpts of the Tehran Times editorial were carried by the
Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia.
   Protesters demanding unification of Soviet Azerbaijan with the
adjacent northern Iranian province also populated by ethnic
Azerbaijanis have been trying to break open the border in
demonstrations that flared last Sunday.
   Tehran television reported last week that four youths from
Soviet Azerbaijan cut barbed wire border fences on the Aras river
and swam safely to the Iranian side, while a fifth companion
drowned.
   The Tehran Times said: ``The Kremlin should avoid suppressing
the Azerbaijani people at all costs.''
   ``Iranian authorities have already begun moves for preparing the
grounds for Azerbaijani Moslems to visit Iran's holy shrines and
religious institutions,'' it added.
   The Azerbaijanis are an ethnic group who, like most Iranians,
are largely Shiite Moslems. Some 4 million Azerbaijanis live in
northern Iran.
   Since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, Soviet officials have
expressed concern about Islamic fundamentalism creeping across the
border.
   IRNA said that following meetings between Iranian and Soviet
officials in Moscow on Friday, the two sides agreed to ease travel
restrictions between the countries and issue visas within 15 days.
It did not say who these officials were.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said 7,500 protesters
destroyed guard observation towers, electronic alarm equipment and
communications lines along the border in the Azerbaijani unrest.
   It said one person was killed in a clash among the protesters
but said border guards did not use their weapons.

<HEAD>Report: Ford Wants To Sell Its Aerospace Division</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. is trying to sell its aerospace
division, a major supplier of missiles, flight training and
satellite technology, a published report said Saturday.
   The Washington Post said the parent company wants to sell its
Ford Aerospace Corp. because of uncertainties over government
defense spending and a need to focus on automaking in the face of
fierce global competition.
   Ford officials would not comment on the report, calling it
``speculative.'' Ford spokesman Bill Peacock in Dearborn, Mich.,
said he was unaware of any ``prospectus'' that the Post said was
being circulated.
   ``I would not say there is nothing out there,'' Peacock said.
``I'm not sure what that document is. I can't say whether
descriptive material might exist.''
   Ford is holding a regularly scheduled board meeting Thursday,
but Peacock said he was not privy to the agenda and did not know
whether a sale would be discussed.
   Peacock said there had been some speculation in trade
publications. Spokesman Thomas Foote said ``it's not a new rumor.''
   The report occurs against a backdrop of concern among defense
contractors that the thaw in East-West relations will mean
reductions in government spending on weaponry.
   Chrysler Corp. announced last month it was pulling out of the
defense business. General Motors has denied any interest in selling
its Hughes Aircraft Co. subsidiary, which started laying off 6,000
of its 75,000 workers in the second half of 1989.
   The Ford aerospace and communications division received $2
billion in contract awards, both civilian and military, in its
fiscal 1989. It employs 17,000 people, and division spokesman
Norman Black said 70 percent of its business is with the military.
   Ford Aerospace produces the Chaparral and Sidewinder missiles
and is one of the largest makers of satellites, supplying the
Superbird to the Japanese. It is heavily involved in satellite
tracking services and runs the military's jet pilot training ranges.
   The division also runs the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's mission control center in Houston and is building
parts of the U.S. space station that is to orbit later this decade.
   Peacock said the division is in good financial shape and has
extensive civilian contracts.
   ``It is solidly profitable and has a big communications activity
with civilian customers, both in this country and Japan,'' Peacock
said.
   When Chrysler Chairman Lee Iaccoca announced the sale of its
Chrysler Technologies Corp., he cited the need to go back to basics
and compete head-to-head with the Japanese automakers.
   When asked whether Ford was planning a consolidation like
Chrysler's, Ford spokesman Foote said, ``If somebody comes along
who wants to talk to us about anything, we'll talk to them.''
   Ford's auto sales dropped 22 percent in late December compared
with a year earlier, but it was the only domestic automaker last
year to increase its market share, the Post said.
   Ford has about $2 billion in cash on hand. Ford acquired
Britain's prestigious Jaguar auto company in November for $2.5
billion, and in August acquired Associates First Capitol Corp., the
nation's third-largest independent finance company, for $3.4
billion.
   ``Ford would not do it for any immediate financial reason
alone,'' said auto analyst Arvid Jouppi. He said he would not be
surprised at such a move,
   ``Whenever one of the big three does something, the other ones
do the same.
   ``The economies are essentially the same for all companies of
the big three.''
   Industry analyst Wolfgang Demisch of UBS Securities Inc. told
the Post such a move would make sense. But he noted that Ford
Aerospace within the last year acquired BDM International, a
government services firm with extensive military contracts.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Saturday with
loyal Communists from Lithuania who oppose their party's bold break
with Moscow, and thousands back home rallied to support them.
   Vitaras Rajavicus, a spokesman for Lithuania's political group
Sajudis, said a delegation of the loyalists met behind closed doors
with Gorbachev in Moscow.
   Gorbachev is undergoing what is widely viewed as a test of his
personal powers of persuasion as he tries to bring renegade
Lithuanians back into the fold. On Dec. 20, a majority of
Lithuanian Communists voted to break ties with the national party,
a possible precursor to secession by the Baltic republic.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev met the republic's party chief, Algirdas
Brazauskas, and other leaders who support the break. He is
scheduled to travel to Lithuania this week.
   The official news agency Tass, in the first official report on
the talks Thursday and Saturday, said they featured ``exchange of
opinions on a way out of the situation.'' It gave no details,
except to say that aside from Gorbachev, the Soviet leadership was
represented at the meetings by Politburo members Vadim A. Medvedev,
Anatoly N. Yakovlev and Georgy P. Razumovsky.
   Participants in the meeting Thursday said Gorbachev understood
that the majority of Lithuanian Communists want independence and
vowed not to interfere.
   Two groups of predominantly non-ethnic Lithuanians sponsored a
rally in the republic's capital Saturday to support continued
alliance with Moscow. An estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered
outside the central sports palace and adopted an appeal to
Gorbachev asking him to condemn ``nationalistic and chauvinistic
overtones'' in their republic and restore the unity of the
Communist Party, Rajavicus said.
   In another development, Radio Moscow said domestic problems had
not forced Gorbachev to cancel all his January meetings with
foreigners, as was reported Friday.
   The broadcast said Gorbachev still plans to meet with U.N. chief
Javier Perez de Cuellar during the week of Jan. 15. In Tokyo, an
official of the governing party said former Foreign Minister
Shintaro Abe has been invited to meet Gorbachev on Jan. 15.
   Tokyo and Hong Kong markets dropped and New York trading was
upset Friday after a British Labor Party spokesman said Gorbachev
canceled his meeting with opposition leader Neil Kinnock set for
that week because of problems in the Soviet Union.
   In addition to the Baltics, Gorbachev is concerned with unrest
in the south. KGB guards were rushed to the Soviet-Iranian frontier
last week after protesters in the republic of Azerbaijan threatened
guards and wrecked border fences.
   Protesters demanded the border be opened for trade, cultural
exchanges and meetings of relatives. As in Iran, most of the people
in Azerbaijan are Shiite Moslems.
   In Iran on Saturday, the English-language Tehran Times suggested
opening the border between Iran's Azerbaijan province and Soviet
Azerbaijan to quell the unrest.
   Tehran radio said Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mahmoud Vaezi,
left for Moscow on Saturday to discuss ``bilateral relations'' with
Soviet officials. It did not elaborate.
   By New Year's Eve, the border zone was occupied by protesters in
tents, and authorities found 300 Molotov cocktails and hunting
guns, the Soviet newspaper Arguments and Facts said Saturday.
   When negotiations collapsed New Year's Day, 9,000 people rioted
along the 85-mile border on the Soviet side, and 800 people from
the Iranian side joined them, the newspaper said.
   A new Communist Party chief was named in the area, the
republic's official Azerinform news agency reported Saturday.
Afedin Dzhalilov was named party first secretary of Nakhichevan, an
Azerbaijan enclave and the site of the unrest. He replaced Gaidar
Isayev, who cited health reasons for stepping down.
   Meanwhile, an explosion at a bus station in Agdam, in Azerbaijan
and near the border of another troubled region, killed two people.
   The explosion occurred Saturday morning near the border of
Nagorno-Karabakh, which both Azerbaijan and the neighboring
republic of Armenia seek to control.
   Azerbaijani activists claimed Armenians were responsible for the
explosion. Tass said it was caused by a gas leak. Nagorno-Karabakh
has been torn by Armenian-Azerbaijani violence for two years. It is
a part of Azerbaijan but populated mainly by Armenians.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega used his power as head
of Panama's intelligence unit, its military and then the entire
country to give aid, comfort and shelter to Colombian cocaine
traffickers in return for millions of dollars, the indictment
against him charges.
   Noriega has been accused in testimony of detailing soldiers as
bodyguards for Colombian drug traffickers, allowing military planes
and airfields to be used for drug shipments, providing traffickers
with intelligence information about U.S. anti-drug operations and
sending armored cars to transport drug money.
   And when Colombian drug lords were angered over a raid on a
cocaine lab in Panama, the indictment recounts, Cuban President
Fidel Castro got them and Noriega together in Havana to mediate a
settlement.
   ``By utilizing his official positions, Manuel Antonio Noriega
and trusted associates were able to assure drug traffickers that
Panamanian military, customs and law enforcement personnel would
not interfere with their operations in Panama as long as
substantial fees were paid to (Noriega),'' says the indictment
handed up in Miami on Feb. 4, 1988.
   Since his arraignment in Miami on Thursday, Noriega's attorneys
have been working on challenges to the indictment and the court's
jurisdiction. They say the indictment was political and that
Noriega claims innocence.
   He could face up to 145 years in prison and more than $1.1
million in fines on charges that include conspiracy and
racketeering.
   The indictment names 15 other defendants ranging from Brian
Alden Davidow, a jailed Miami college student charged with meeting
with Noriega to arrange cocaine shipments, to Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, the reputed Medellin cartel cocaine kingpin being pursued
by Colombian authorities.
   While U.S. officials have accused leaders of other governments,
particularly Cuba, of helping drug traffic to the United States for
political reasons, Noriega's prime motivation seemed to be money,
officials say.
   U.S. authorities say they have identified at least $10 million
kept in European banks by Noriega, who rose from a poor family and
reputedly supplemented his $60,000 annual salary with interests in
casinos, liquor stores, news media outlets and banks.
   ``Money attracted him (to drug traffic). Noriega really loves
money and luxury,'' said Ambler Moss, a former U.S. ambassador to
Panama.
   The Miami indictment details at least $4.6 million in payments
Noriega allegedly received for protecting cocaine and drug money
shipments, selling seized ether and acetone used in making cocaine
to Colombian drug traffickers, and for giving sanctuary to drug
dealers in 1984 when the Colombian government went after them
following the assassination of a justice minister.
   Noriega also is accused of allowing establishment of a cocaine
laboratory in Panama's Darien province and helping the manufacture
of cocaine in another laboratory in the nearby Colombian area
dubbed ``Tranquilandia.''
   A separate indictment in Tampa says Noriega agreed to protect
two marijuana shipments totaling 1.4 million pounds for $4 million,
of which he received $1 million.
   When he announced the 12-count Miami indictment, then-U.S.
Attorney Leon Kellner noted that the case was unprecedented, but
added that Noriega's influence in Panama was so pervasive that he
was able to guarantee protection for trafficking.
   ``General Noriega controls Panama (and) he utilized his position
to sell the country of Panama to traffickers,'' Kellner said at the
time. Kellner, now in private practice in Washington, said last
week he wouldn't comment on the Noriega case.
   Convicted drug smuggler Floyd Carlton Caceres told a U.S. Senate
hearing in 1988 that he acted as a go-between in 1982, getting
Noriega $200,000 a flight from the Medellin Cartel for protecting
drug flights through Panama. Carlton, sentenced to nine years in
prison in 1988 in Miami, has been called a key witness by
prosecutors.
   Boris Olarte Morales, a convicted Colombian drug smuggler, may
testify about a $4 million bribe the indictment says he paid
Noriega.
   Other possible witnesses include convicted drug smugglers Ramon
Milian Rodriguez, Cuban-born, and Stephen Kalish, a Houston native
prominent in the Tampa case against Noriega. They have testified
that the Noriega package of protection included armored car
transport of their money, use of military airfields, immediate
credit for deposits into Panamanian banks and intelligence
information.
   Another crucial witness is expected to be Jose Blandon, a former
Noriega confidant who broke with him in January 1988 and testified
before the Senate and federal grand jury.
   Blandon said that in June 1984, Panamanian authorities raided
the Darien processing plant and arrested 23 Colombians and Lt. Col.
Julian Melo, secretary general of Noriega's staff. Blandon has said
the Colombian traffickers, saying they had paid Melo $5 million to
protect the operation, were outraged by the raid, which occurred
while Noriega was in Paris.
   Castro was contacted by the Colombians, Blandon has said, and
arranged a meeting at which Noriega was assured there would be no
reprisals from the traffickers. Melo and the Colombians were soon
freed, Blandon said, and equipment and $3 million were returned to
the traffickers.
   Castro and Noriega have both denounced Blandon's charges as lies.

<HEAD>Police Chief Commits Suicide Over Role in Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city police chief whose officers
nearly clashed with demonstrators in November committed suicide and
left a note saying he couldn't stand being blamed for the incident,
a news report said Saturday.
   The demonstration occurred during the popular uprising that
eventually swept the hard-line Communist leadership from power in
Czechoslovakia.
   The police chief was the third official associated with the
former power structure to commit suicide or attempt it last week.
   In other developments Saturday:
   _The Communists' Central Committee, meeting for the first time
since its formation in December, elected a new 24-member executive
body to replace the former ruling Politburo.
   _Former Communist Party leader Milos Jakes said the monopoly on
power that the Communists enjoyed until recently left them without
the political skills needed to meet the challenges of 1989.
   _An American congressional delegation said the United States may
award Czechoslovakia most favored nation trading status soon, a
development that could help the nation's economy.
   Josef Petracek, chief of police in the northern city of Teplice,
75 miles north of Prague, was found dead Friday morning after
having shot himself with his own gun, the state news agency CTK
reported.
   ``He left a goodbye note saying the reason for his suicide was
pressure on him and the responsibility he felt for the police
action on Nov. 11-13 in Teplice against demonstrators demanding a
better environment,'' CTK reported.
   When several hundred people protested severe pollution in the
region, riot police moved in to disperse them. But the officers
were called off by a local Communist Party leader who agreed to
talk with the demonstrators.
   The protest marked one of the first instances of officials
agreeing to talk to the people as popular unrest spread in
Czechoslovakia, eventually ending four decades of Communist Party
supremacy.
   The news report did not say where Petracek was when he shot
himself.
   On Wednesday, Jiri Becvar, a senior police official in Prague,
also shot himself to death. He was charged with participating in a
bloody police crackdown on students Nov. 17.
   Antonin Kapek, former Prague Communist Party boss, attempted
suicide Thursday, citing what he called the unbearable pressure he
was facing. He survived and was hospitalized in a psychiatric
institution, media reported.
   Jakes, who was ousted as party leader on Nov. 24, discussed the
Communist Party's problems in an interview broadcast Saturday on
the Europe Express program on London's Channel Four in Britain.
Excerpts of the interview were released by the program in advance
of the broadcast.
   ``The party's problem was that because of centralized control,
the party's power monopoly and the lack of an opposition, we
couldn't fight political battles any more,'' he said.
   Jakes has been expelled from the Communist Party. He was widely
held to be responsible for the purges of party members that
followed the Warsaw Pact invasion in 1968 that crushed the
reformist government of Alexander Dubcek.
   Jakes contended he was not responsible for the purges.
   ``That's a false version, that is years old,'' he said. ``The
purge was ordered by the party Central Committee. I wasn't on the
Central Committee. I headed the Control and Audit Commission, we
just heard appeals against the decision of other party bodies.''
   Though the Soviet Union and its allies have recently said the
1968 Warsaw Pact invasion was a mistake, Jakes said it is too early
to judge. ``It wasn't considered a mistake then, but a step to
strengthen the socialist community. History will be the judge. It's
only been 20 years, that's too little. While those who took part
are alive, one can't be objective.
   ``From the point of view of today's events _ like perestroika,
glasnost, democratization _ it seems a mistake. But history cannot
be changed.''
   Regarding the trade development, a group of U.S. congressmen,
led by Rep. John J. La Falce, D-N.Y. said the most-favored-nation
trading status could be granted as soon as Czechoslovakia
implements planned economic reforms and further political changes,
CTK reported.
   ``The United States will award Czechoslovakia the MFN clause as
soon as some of the expected political and economic changes take
place. It is a matter of several months, possibly weeks,'' CTK
reported.
   In December 1989, the new non-Communist-dominated Czechoslovak
government declared its intention to pass several new laws
guaranteeing among other things freedoms of gathering, association
and private enterprise.
   Some of these laws could be passed as early as February, sources
say.
   The Communists' new executive body, which replaces the
Politburo, includes the party's chairman Ladislav Adamec, first
secretary Vasil Mohorita and three newly elected secretaries, CTK
said.
   Adamec, speaking to the Central Committee, supported the idea of
national understanding, but stressed that differences between
Czechoslovakia's current political forces remain.

   Residents accused of using a car to
solicit a prostitute or driving with a suspended license can have
the vehicles confiscated under a new law that city officials think
is the first of its kind.
   Since the forfeiture law went into effect Dec. 15, about 15
vehicles have been seized from people accused of driving with
licenses suspended under a prior drunken driving charge, police
spokesman Dave Simpson said Friday. Thirteen vehicles were taken
from prostitution suspects, including an 11-ton delivery truck.
   The city has been seizing vehicles of all those arrested who fit
the provisions of the law, a police spokesman said Saturday, but it
probably won't keep many of the cars and trucks it seizes, although
the ordinance allows it.
   The forfeiture part of the law has raised the ire of the
American Civil Liberties Union, which has threatened to challenge
the ordinance.
   The ordinance is aimed at discouraging drunken driving and
prostitution, not at raising money for city coffers, officials say.
   ``The average `john' is a married man with a job,'' said City
Commissioner Bob Koch, whose staff drafted the ordinance. ``It's
going to be awfully hard for a guy to go home and explain to his
wife where the car is.''
   Administrative costs probably will exceed the value of the
vehicles seized, said Deputy City Attorney Paul Elsener.
   ``I don't even think it (the forfeitures) will cover the cost of
this program. I think it's a money loser,'' he said.
   Elsener said that while a $20,000 Chevy Blazer was seized from a
man accused of soliciting a policewoman posing as a prostitute,
most of the vehicles taken from those with suspended licenses were
valued at less than $1,000.
   The city attorney's office is drafting criteria to use in
deciding which vehicles to keep, Elsener said. ``They may include
value, the history of the person, and other types of extenuating or
mitigating circumstances,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the ACLU's lawyers' committee plans to meet Wednesday
to discuss whether to challenge the ordinance in court because a
vehicle can be forfeited before its owner is convicted.
   ``I understand the enormous frustration caused by lack of space
to incarcerate people, but now they're trying to violate people's
rights,'' said Stevie Remington, executive director of the state
chapter.
   ``We don't think there's anything wrong with impounding a car if
someone is drunk and keeping it for a short period of time, but
certainly not until after a conviction should there be a
forfeiture.''
   ``The mere fact that someone is acquitted does not imply that
he'll get his vehicle back,'' Elsener said.
   A person can file a claim to the city to get his car back, and
take the matter to court if the claim is denied, Elsener said.
   Those whose cars are seized but not forfeited still must pay
towing and storage costs, he said.
   The provisions intended to deter drunken driving are unique in
the nation, Elsener said. He believes the same is true for the
prostitution provisions.
   Koch said the new ordinance should make a dent in the city's
prostitution problem.
   ``Our real goal here is to convince the marketplace that the
cost of street prostitution is too high and the johns will stay
away from the city,'' Koch said. ``We're going to see a decrease in
prostitution.''

   A teen-ager who helped run a computer
bulletin board service showing how to make explosive devices was
sentenced to three years in prison for his part in a bombing
intended to scare a 17-year-old girl.
   David Overeem, 18, Gaithersburg, Md., received the sentence
Friday from Montgomery County Circuit Judge John J. Mitchell. The
computer service, ``Pyromaniac Production Systems,'' reportedly
gave formulas for homemade bombs to users as far away as
California, prosecutors said.
   Authorities said Overeem was one of the leaders of a group of
acquaintances who called themselves ``Damage Incorporated.''
Assistant State's Attorney Constance Junghans said in court that
the group loaded the bulletin board with recipes for an array of
explosive devices, including rockets, car bombs, pipe bombs, bottle
bombs and land mines.
   Overeem was a junior at Gaithersburg High School at the time of
his arrest in April and was described by prosecutors as an
``emotionally troubled'' young man of superior intelligence.
   Overeem pleaded guilty to making a pipe bomb that allegedly was
detonated by a friend of his on March 26 outside the girl's home in
Germantown, which like Gaithersburg is a distant suburb of
Washington, D.C.
   The bombing was intended only to frighten the girl, who a former
girlfriend of Overeem's friend, prosecutors said.
   No one was injured, but a piece of shrapnel tore through a wall
and into a room where three children were asleep, authorities said.
   ``I don't know when some cowardly, yellow-bellied so-and-so ...
is going to place one of these devices, just for fun, in someone's
home, or car or office,'' Mitchell told Overeem.
   He imposed the maximum 20-year sentence for the offense of
manufacturing a destructive explosive device, but suspended all but
three years of the term.
   After Overeem's arrest, investigators said extensive computer
records found in his bedroom showed that hundreds of people had
access to the bulletin board, including some of the four teenagers
killed Dec. 31, 1988, in the accidental explosion of a pipe bomb
they were building in a Bethesda, Md., garage.

   Forecasters said Saturday there is
only a 40 percent chance that weather at the Kennedy Space Center
will be satisfactory on Monday to launch space shuttle Columbia on
a 10-day mission.
   ``It does not look all that good right now,'' said Terri
Brasher, a spokeswoman for Air Force weather forecasters. She
ticked off potential problems: poor visibility, a thick layer of
clouds hanging low over the launch area and rain, but said ``we
remain optimistic.''
   Ed Priselac, the space shuttle weather officer, said odds
against a launch on Monday because of bad weather were 60 percent
because of a front moving into Florida. Under NASA's inflexible
rules, rain in the launch path or visibility less than seven miles
would cause a launch to be scrubbed.
   A postponement would be the fourth for Columbia, whose mission
on this 33rd shuttle flight is to launch one satellite and to
retrieve another. By doubling the time in space from the normal
five days, NASA hopes to acquire data on the astronauts' long
exposure to weightlessness as well as that of their ship.
   The object is to modify Columbia, alone among the three
shuttles, for long duration flights. A 16-day flight is planned for
1992, to be followed eventually by missions of up to 28 days.
   These are stepping stones for a permanently manned space station
in which astronauts would spend six months in orbit, and for
flights to Mars, which could take up to two years.
   Only once before, in November-December 1983, has a shuttle
remained in space for 10 days.
   The space agency reported no problems in readying the ship for
its ninth flight since the countdown began Thursday.
   NASA test conductor Mike Leinbach said the weather outlook would
be evaluated late Sunday night before workers start the flow of a
half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into
Columbia's fuel tanks.
   Plans are for Columbia to catch up with the Long Duration
Exposure Facility _ a 30-foot-long satellite launched from the
shuttle in 1984 _ move in front of it, and grapple it from above
with the shuttle's robot arm.
   The satellite was to have been retrieved after one year of
exposing 57 experiments to the rigors of space. But budget problems
and the Challenger disaster delayed the rescue mission until now.
   Bill Kinard, chief scientist on the project, said the extra time
in space has been a bonanza.
   ``Almost all the experiments have benefited,'' he said. ``LDEF
is a virtual treasure trove of science and technology information.''
   Included among the materials exposed to space are 12{ million
tomato seeds, which will be distributed among students from grade 5
through university levels to study genetic and other changes.
   If not retrieved and brought back to Earth in Columbia's cargo
bay, the satellite is expected to reenter the atmosphere and burn
up by March 9. Its scientific mission would be wasted.
   Columbia is scheduled to lift off Monday between 8:10 a.m. EST
and 9:08. The day of the satellite retrieval depends on the exact
time of launch and could be Thursday, Saturday or Sunday.
   First, however, 24 hours after the liftoff, the astronauts will
release a Navy communications satellite _ the fifth in a series _
from their cargo bay.
   The astronauts, who flew here Friday from their training base in
Houston, were briefed on the weather and other aspects of the
flight today.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and pilot Jim Wetherbee practiced
shuttle landings in a jet outfitted to operate like the shuttle.
The other crew members are mission specialists Bonnie Dunbar,
Marsha Ivins and David Low.

   Players in the world of consumer electronics
were given an upbeat assessment of the industry Saturday, then
fanned out over acres of gadgetry to get an idea of what's hot for
the 1990s.
   The Consumer Electronics Show _ dubbed a Disneyland for adults _
kicked off its four-day run on an optimistic note, with industry
leaders challenging manufacturers and dealers to build on the
successes of the 1980s.
   Some 70,000 manufacturers, dealers and journalists from the
United States and 80 foreign countries will view thousands of
products showcased over 800,000 square feet of display space before
the show ends Tuesday.
   Some 1,400 exhibitors are displaying 95 product lines at the
city's convention center and four major hotels.
   Wholesale consumer electronic sales reached $32.2 billion in
1989, a 6 percent increase over the previous year, Frank Myers,
president of Wells-Gardner Electric Corp., told delegates in a
keynote address.
   He predicted that figure for 1990 would reach $33.4 billion.
   ``Most economists believe the U.S. economy is heading for a
`soft landing' in 1990 rather than the recession that was widely
predicted earlier,'' Myers said.
   Bernard Brennan, chairman of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., acknowledged
that the difficult economy and competition among many stores
selling electronics present challenges for the 1990s.
   Successful retailers ``will have a passion for serving
customers,'' he said. ``The winners will be entrepreneurial. They
will be opportunistic.''
   A major factor that will affect the 1990s is the ``graying of
the consumer base,'' Brennan said.
   ``This change in demographics to an older population is
developing the concept of `cocooning' _ that is, spending a great
deal of time in one's home. This trend offers all of us an
opportunity to fulfill the `home theater' needs of this growing
consumer group,'' Brennan said.
   One of the highlights of the show is the merger of audio and
video products to create a ``home theater.''
   This year's show also features VCRs, compact disc players, fax
machines, talking auto alarm systems, high definition television,
laptop computers, whole-house home automation products and cellular
phones.
   Also spotlighted will be the growing trend of home offices.
Recent statistics show that nearly 25 million Americans work at
home, and about 25 percent of those households contain two
home-based professionals, said Dennis Corcoran, the show's vice
president.
   ``You are going to see a lot of personal electronics at the
show, items that can be used in the home office such as
translators, computers, and hand held items you can take on the
go,'' said show spokeswoman Cynthia Upson. ``Now you can take a fax
machine and cellular phone with you, and can fax something back to
your office.''
   Another feature is home automation, which was introduced in the
infancy stage at last year's show.
   ``This system enables all the different appliances and consumer
electronics products to talk to each other,'' Ms. Upson said. ``You
can use your telephone to lock doors while you're away, turn on
alarm systems, turn on the dishwasher, program the VCR, set heating
or air conditioning.''

   Nicolae Ceausescu was a morose boy
who dreamed of power while fellow children in his hometown pursued
more innocent ideals, the former dictator's cousin recalled
Saturday.
   Florea Ceausescu, who has spent his life a stone's throw from
his infamous cousin's modest childhood home, depicted him as a
cruel and selfish man with no time for anyone outside his immediate
clique, and other long-time Scornicesti residents concurred.
   ``Even as a youngster he had the feeling that he would lead the
people,'' the 71-year-old said of his cousin, nodding toward
Ceausescu's first home. ``He was a cruel man, who worked only for
his own people and had no feelings for outsiders.''
   Florea Ceausescu lives across the street from the three-room hut
where Ceausescu spent his first 12 years. He said Ceausescu showed
no interest in neighbors on his rare visits, ``and we had no chance
to talk to him because he was always surrounded by bodyguards.''
   Municipal officials painted a picture of an inward,
unapproachable man, whose dreaded Securitate secret police took
over the town of 13,000 whenever the dictator visited.
   ``They would never announce his coming,'' Mayor Ilie Manea said.
``Around 500 Securitate would converge in town, and in the
surrounding hills and forests, and the mayor's and local police's
only job was to find enough people to get together a cheering
crowd.''
   The town, about 120 miles northwest of Bucharest, showed little
sign Saturday of the violent upheaval that toppled Ceausescu and
led to his and his wife's execution Dec. 25.
   But there was evidence of the depth of feeling against the
dictator and his clique.
   The dirt floors of Ceausescu's childhood home were covered with
shards of glass from broken portraits of the iron-fisted leader and
his parents. The inside of a luxurious adjoining villa belonging to
Ceausescu's sister, Elena Bobulescu, was in disarray, its cupboards
ripped open and their contents strewn about.
   Florea Ceausescu, his face bearing uncanny resemblance to his
cousin except for several day's growth of beard and deep lines
etched by a hard life, smiled when asked if his name would cause
him trouble.
   ``I will change my name,'' he declared. ``Everyone will now say
that we are all bad because of the name.''
   Ceausescu said he had little contact with his cousin after the
future leader moved to Bucharest at age 12 and became an apprentice
cobbler.
   But he recalled a moody, strange youth with a sense of mission.
   ``He would play for awhile, and then he would suddenly stop for
no reason and say, `I've had enough,''' he said. ``He was a little
strange. He never laughed, he was serious all the time.''
   Nicolae Ceausescu's thirst for power was at least initally
intertwined with idealistic strivings to improve the lot of a
backward people, his cousin suggested.
   Shortly after his move to Bucharest, the young Ceausescu was
arrested for illegal activities tied to his activism in the
Communist Party, and he reappeared briefly in Scornicesti at age 14
after two years in prison.
   Before World War II, the Communists were a tiny group viewed as
anarchist troublemakers by Romanian authorities.
   ``My father asked him `Why did you go to jail?'' Florea
Ceausescu said. ``He answered, `I went to jail so we can work the
land with heavy machinery and we can raise production.'''
   But all idealism appeared to be extinguished in the last years
of Ceausescu's 24-year tenure at the helm of the country.
   The 1980s were marked by growing privation across the nation.
The meager amount of national income left by Ceausescu's drive to
pay off a massive foreign debt was consumed by extravagant
construction projects of questionable value.
   ``The only thing important to Nicolae was not people but
building monuments,'' his cousin alleged, saying his own small
house nearly fell victim to the dictator's grandiose scheme to raze
traditional village homes and move their owners into impersonal
apartment blocks.

<HEAD>U.S. Carrier Expected to Lead Drug Interdiction Off Colombian
Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy has been
chosen to lead an anti-drug interdiction effort off the coast of
Colombia, but final decisions about when the warship may be put to
work haven't been made yet, a Defense Department source said
Saturday.
   The carrier and an accompanying guided missile cruiser, the USS
Virginia, left Norfolk, Va., on Thursday to engage in routine
training exercises in the Atlantic, a Pentagon official said, but
he added that a question mark remained as to when and if the
warships would see duty in a proposed U.S.-Colombian anti-drug
interdiction effort.
   ``That's the group. The JFK is the one to be used,'' said the
official. ``But it's still a question when they'd be put to use.''
   Two Colombian radio networks, Caracol and RCN, on Saturday
quoted unnamed Pentagon sources as saying the ships were headed
toward Colombia to begin setting up a blockade to try to stop drug
smugglers.
   But the Pentagon official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the final plans were still being worked out on a
Pentagon proposal to launch a virtual air and sea blockade of the
Colombian coastline as part of an effort to help Colombia curb the
illicit narcotics exports of its drug cartels.
   An administration U.S. official Saturday denied that any
blockade was under way.
   ``Nothing's been initiated,'' in terms of activating such
efforts, he said.
   ``We are consulting'' with the Colombians and will continue to
do so over the next few days, the administration official said. He
declined to say when the heightened military operation might begin,
and said it should not be called a blockade.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said U.S. ships had been
scheduled to sail to Colombia to help with the anti-drug effort,
but she did not know when or have any more details on the operation.
   ``We knew the boats were going down there,'' Glen said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is expected soon to announce a
White House-approved plan for getting U.S. military forces more
deeply involved in the international drug battle.
   President Bush is scheduled to travel to Colombia in February
for an anti-drug summit of the leaders of the Andean nations.
   A senior Defense Department official said last month the air and
sea effort was expected to be enacted prior to Bush's trip to
Colombia.
   After that report appeared, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater acknowledged that ``final plans were being made.''
   Under the reported anti-drug effort, the Navy was to operate an
aircraft carrier battle group off the Caribbean coast of Colombia
on a rotating basis. Each carrier group would be in position for
one or two months, a time frame similar to normal training
deployments.
   The senior Pentagon official had said that much of the money for
operating the battle group would come from training funds.
   The Pentagon official also emphasized that U.S. Navy fighters
would not be given the authority to shoot down suspected
drug-running planes. That enforcement role, he said, was to be
handled by Colombian officials.
   An aircraft carrier normally has eight or 12 smaller ships as
part of its battle group, along with an aircraft wing composed of
about 3,000 men and dozens of observation and tracking planes, and
those would be in the forefront of the surveillance efforts.
   Pentagon officials long have said the high-tech radar and
surveillance equipment owned by the U.S. Navy would be their main
weapon in keeping tabs on suspected drug dealers' boats and planes.

<HEAD>5 Reported Wounded by Troops in Gaza Clashes</HEAD>

   Israeli troops shot and wounded at least five
Palestinians in clashes Saturday in the occupied Gaza Strip,
hospital officials and Arab reporters said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   In east Jerusalem, about 50 Americans demonstrated in front of
the U.S. Consulate to support the Palestinian uprising. Police did
not intervene, and no incidents were reported.
   In Syria, a breakaway Palestinian group claimed responsibility
Saturday for shooting incidents on the border between Jordan and
Israel. The Damascus-based Fatah Uprising group claimed it killed
and wounded an unspecified number of Israeli soldiers in two
separate attacks Thursday and Friday, but the Israeli army reported
no casualties among its forces.
   The protests Saturday came as a Palestinian strike shut stores
and curtailed traffic throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Dozens of Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at soldiers
on Gaza City's main commercial Omar el-Mikhtar street, said the
hospital officials and Arab reporters. They said four Palestinians
were wounded in Gaza City and a fifth in Gaza's Rafah refugee camp.
   The strike was ordered by the PLO-affiliated underground leaders
of the Palestinian uprising.
   At least 642 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since the
uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. Another 166 have been slain by Arabs
as collaborators with the Israeli administration. Forty-three
Israelis have been killed.
   In east Jerusalem, the American protesters held signs saying:
``Recognize the Palestinian state,'' ``Our taxes kill
Palestinians,'' and ``Stop U.S. aid to Israel, end occupation.''
   Israel receives $3 billion annually in U.S. aid.
   Most of the participants arrived in Israel for a Dec. 30
demonstration in which about 15,000 Israeli, Palestinian and
foreign peace activists formed a human chain around Jerusalem's
walled Old City.
   ``As U.S. citizens we demand the end of our government's silence
in regard to Israeli human rights abuses. We demand the end of U.S.
aid for the occupation, and we call on our government to recognize
the state of Palestine,'' said Jon Miles, a landscaper from Tucson,
Ariz.
   The left-wing Mapam party on Saturday demanded that Parliament
debate a travel ban imposed on Feisal Husseini, a leading pro-PLO
activist.
   The three-month ban was issued by Interior Minister Arye Deri
and handed to Husseini's family Thursday night.
   In the document, dated Jan. 3, Deri wrote he decided on the step
because he was convinced that if Husseini traveled abroad it ``may
harm the security of the state.'' It followed the Dec. 6
restriction barring Husseini from entering the occupied West Bank
and the Gaza Strip for six months.
   Husseini, who lives in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, has been
named in court documents as a leader of the uprising but has not
been charged with any crime.
   Chaim Ramon of the left-leaning Labor Party called on Deri to
cancel the ban, saying it was aimed at preventing any prospect of
establishing a Palestinian leadership prepared to talk to Israel,
Israel radio reported.

   Inmates who may have been excluded
from a general amnesty rioted at a prison in Slovakia and took over
some parts of the penitentiary, the Communist Party newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The Rude Pravo daily said the riot began Thursday night at the
prison in Leopoldov, 250 miles east of Prague. ``The inmates
started attacking the wardens and managed to gain control of parts
of the prison,'' the paper said.
   ``No casualties have been reported so far, but it was not
possible to find out whether the inmates held hostages or not,''
Rude Pravo said.
   ``The reason for the riot is not known, but it could be the
unfulfilled demand for a general amnesty,'' the paper said.
   Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist president, Vaclav Havel,
ordered the release of two-thirds of Czechoslovakia's 31,000
prisoners on Jan. 1 in what is considered the broadest amnesty in
four decades.
   The paper said some Leopoldov prisoners who committed murders,
terrorism and robberies were excluded from the amnesty.

<HEAD>Report Angolan Troops Capture Rebel Stronghold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News reports said Saturday that Angolan
troops captured a strategic town from guerrillas, but the
insurgents claimed they repelled the attack and 86 government
soldiers were killed.
   In New York, Angola's ambassador to the United Nations, Manuel
Pedro Pacavira, announced that more than 25,000 Cuban soldiers have
withdrawn from Angola and 8,000 others would leave within the next
three months.
   He did not say how many Cuban soldiers were in Angola, but up to
50,000 Cuban troopers have been there helping the Marxist
government battle U.S.-backed rebels since the country gained
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Pacavira's announcement said the withdrawal of Cuban troops,
agreed to under an accord signed in December 1988, ``is proceeding
at an accelerated rate'' and all Cuban forces would be out of the
country before July 1, 1991.
   Portuguese news reports from the Angolan capital of Luanda
quoted unidentified official sources as saying the government
launched an offensive late last month and captured Mavinga, 700
miles southeast of Luanda.
   The Expresso newspaper said government troops entered Mavinga
during the night of Dec. 23. The town is considered an important
link in the rebels' defense system around their stronghold in
Jamba, about 125 miles to the south.
   A rebel statement sent to Lisbon from Jamba said 86 government
soldiers and 13 guerrillas were killed in the fighting that ended
Jan. 3. It said the rebel forces sill held Mavinga.
   The guerrillas of the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, also claimed their four Soviet advisers to the
government were wounded in the fighting.
   They said their artillery destroyed a C-130 Hercules transport
plane flying government reinforcements to the southeast. The
statement claimed most of the plane's passengers perished, but no
casualty figures were given.
   A government statement reported by Portugal's Lusa news agency
confirmed a Hercules had been hit near the town of Menongue, 560
miles southeast of Luanda, and said nine passengers were wounded.
   The government generally uses Soviet-built Antonov planes for
troop transport but the armed forces occasionally charter U.S.-made
C-130s from private firms.
   Eight African leaders are scheduled to meet Wednesday in Luanda
to discuss prospects for ending the 15-year-old civil war.
   Last June, Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the U.S.-supported
rebels, and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos agreed to a
cease-fire during talks in Gbadolite, Zaire, but fighting quickly
resumed.
   Both sides recently presented new cease-fire proposals to Zaire
President Mobutu Sese Seko who is acting as a mediator.

<HEAD>Bishop Who Fled Because of Death Threats Returns to Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lutheran bishop who fled El
Salvador under death threats returned Saturday, escorted by a group
of clerics for protection.
   The Rev. Medardo Gomez, now head of the Protestant demonination
in Central America, said he was forced to leave Nov. 26 because the
government's persecution of church workers ``was tremendous.''
   In November, in the middle of the biggest leftist guerrilla
offensive in El Salvador's decade-old civil war, President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist government indicated church workers were
suspected of cooperating with the rebels.
   ``I am not a criminal, I am not a terrorist, I am a pastor, and
our work is to worry about the poor and is not inspired by any
social ideology,'' Gomez told a news conference on his arrival.
   During the monthlong offensive, dozens of Roman Catholic,
Anglican, Lutheran, Episcopal and Baptist clergy and church workers
suspected of cooperating with the rebels were rounded up by
government troops and thrown out of the country.
   Six Jesuit priests, all leading educators, along with their
housekeeper and her daughter were fatally shot and their bodies
mutilated at their home. Church leaders blamed the army for the
massacre, and the government promised an investigation.
   Gomez, 44, then the leader of El Salvador's Lutheran church,
left after receiving several death threats.
   He flew in Saturday from the United States accompanied a dozen
clergy, including the Revs. Roger White, Anglican bishop of
Milwaukee; Arthur McGovern, a Jesuit priest from Detroit; Peter
Rogness, Lutheran bishop of Milwaukee; and Cristina Gronn, vice
president of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America.
   Gronn said the delegation would celebrate the Feast of the
Epiphany with Salvadoran religious communities, provide security
for Gomez and express support for all those church workers still
being persecuted.
   Gomez did not say how long he will remain in El Salvador.
   ``I know conditions do not exist for me to live freely, doing my
work ... There are military groups who are persecuting the
church,'' he added.
   But he said he ``does not want to hold the (military) high
command responsible because they have officially told us the armed
forces have nothing against the churches.''
   ``My struggle now will be to pray and speak abroad about
dialogue and negotiations and create conditions for a pacification
process in El Salvador,'' he said.
   Talks for a cease-fire and eventual peace broke off shortly
before the offensive began, with government and rebel leaders
accusing each other of not negotiating in good faith.
   Gronn said the delegation has asked President Bush to suspend
military aid to the Cristiani government to pressue him into
resuming the cease-fire talks.
   The United States currently provides $1.5 million daily in
economic and military assistance.
   ``We are worried by the escalation of violence in the Salvadoran
conflict and the role of the United States, which supplies military
assistance that perpetuates the violences. We are in favor of a
political and not a military solution,'' Gronn said.
   Gomez then added: ``As a church, we condemn all forms of
violence and must pronounce ourselves against all assistance that
promotes this violence, regardless from where this military aid
comes from.''
   More than 71,000 people have been killed in the civil war.

   Joyful Panamanians applauded the GIs who
ousted dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega, but for many elsewhere in
Latin America, the U.S. invasion left a bitter taste.
   In an angry response to the Dec. 20 invasion, Peruvian President
Alan Garcia initially suspended anti-narcotics operations with U.S.
agents in his country and said he would not show up at a drug
conference with other Andean leaders and President Bush.
   Mexico, traditionally a critic of American military
intervention, announced it would continue relations with Panama but
said it would not send back its ambassador, Carlos Planck, to
Panama City.
   A leading political opposition group, the conservative National
Action Party, called the American invasion a ``transgression of the
most elemental principles of international law by a country who
says it is respectful of juridical norms.''
   Panamanians took to the streets to applaud Noriega's surrender
to U.S. authorities Wednesday and his departure to Florida to face
U.S. drug trafficking charges. Public opinion polls show wide
Panamanian approval of the U.S. actions.
   But independent newspapers in Mexico, Chile and Brazil, mindful
of a history of U.S. intervention in Latin America, lambasted the
invasion.
   Calling Noriega's capture ``a tiny war trophy for the biggest
power on earth,'' Chile's Ultimas Noticias said:
   ``We don't like General Noriega, nor the way he ruled his
country. Nevertheless, neither his bragging, nor his links to
corruption, nor his lack of respect for the verdicts of the polls,
justify that the United States, which always likes to pontificate
about juridical principles, tramples these in order to get its
way.''
   The Brazilian newspaper Jornal do Brasil called the capture ``a
Pyrrhic victory'' for the United States and praised the Vatican, in
whose embassy Noriega was a refugee for more than a week, for
``maintaining an impeccable line of conduct _ the same cannot be
said for U.S. intervention.''
   ``The occupation forces established an aggressive ring around
the Vatican embassy, invaded the Nicaraguan ambassador's residence
and dealt violent blows to continental cooperation,'' Jornal do
Brasil added.
   The Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo said ``U.S. policy in
Central America will not advance positively so long as there is a
predisposition in undertaking adventures of this type, to the
detriment of coherent strategies for economic and social
development.''
   The Mexican newspaper El Universal, referring to the U.S.
action, said ``the end does not justify the means.''
   Garcia hoisted the Panamanian flag alongside that of the
Peruvian colors in his presidential palace in Lima as a gesture of
solidarity ``with the Panamanian people,'' and Foreign Minister
Guillermo Larco Cox called President Guillermo Endara, who
succeeded Noriega in power, ``the Judas of Central America.''
   Peru initially suspended joint anti-drug patrols and said it
would boycott the anti-drug summit in protest.
   But Peru on Dec. 26 resumed U.S.-Peruvian drug patrols in its
country, and U.S. and Peruvian officials said last week that Peru
had reversed its decision not to attend anti-drug talks with the
United States, Bolivia and Colombia. Peru says Garcia will not
attend the Feb. 15 meeting with Bush.
   But the Lima newspaper Expreso had criticized Garcia's protests,
saying ``the Panamanian people preferred an American invasion
rather than continue suffering the dictator.''
   The Bolivian newpspaper Ultima Hora attributed what happened in
Panama ``not only as the result of the forced and resigned
submission of the people, but to the lack of a true Latin American
system that defends the justice, freedom and sovereignty of its
countries.''
   In Honduras, the closest U.S. ally in the region, the newspaper
Tiempo called Noriega a ``coward'' and a ``poor devil'' and said
the dictator's cause ``was never that of the Panamanian people.''

   A plane carrying 61 Romanian children whose
adoptions by French parents had been blocked by Nicolae Ceausescu's
government landed Saturday to a joyful welcome from their new
families.
   ``We are in debt to the Romanian people for winning freedom for
these children,'' said Jacques Lellioz of St. Nazaire in western
France, who waited more than three years for his adopted daughter,
Maeva.
   ``I would have liked a little more intimacy, with everything
more discreet,'' Lellioz said amid the tumult of reporters and
television cameras covering the arrival of the government-chartered
plane at Orly airport.
   Also Saturday, an Italian air force plane flew from Bucharest,
the Romanian capital, to Italy with more orphans for long-waiting
parents.
   Philippe Chabin's daughter, Roxanna, opened presents from her
new French cousins after rushing into the arms of her adopted
father, who had staged two hunger strikes to try to pressure the
Romanian government into letting her go.
   ``We will adopt other children,'' Chabin said. ``But not in
Romania.''
   In the early 1980s, hundreds of French parents sought and found
children in Romania when demand for adoptive children in France was
greater than the supply.
   Ceausescu's policies encouraging large families, combined with
widespread shortages of food and other necessities, produced large
numbers of children available for adoption.
   The prospective parents had to pay thousands of dollars in
official fees and often thousands more to corrupt officials to get
a child.
   But in July 1988, Ceausescu's government halted any new adoption
cases for foreign parents, and in January 1989 it refused to allow
the departure of 89 children whose adoption procedures were
complete or nearly complete.
   After Ceausescu was overthrown and executed last month following
a popular revolution, the French Foreign Ministry said his
authoritarian government had engaged in ``blackmail to obtain, in
exchange for the children, the resumption of political and economic
relations, which France had broken off because of human rights
violations in Romania.''
   The new authorities in Romania abolished the ban on foreign
adoptions, and the French Foreign Ministry chartered a plane to fly
the adoptive parents to Bucharest to pick up the children and
return home.
   ``We are happy for the happy futures of these children,''
Dumitru Mazilu, deputy chairman of Romania's ruling Council of
National Salvation, said at a short ceremony organized at the
Bucharest airport.
   ``Those who died in the revolution also died for these
children,'' he said.
   Some children awaited by adoptive parents were not on the plane.
French officials said in some cases, authorities had not had time
to check back with the Romanian families to be sure they still want
to give their children up for adoption, a decision often made
between two and four years ago.
   In other cases, the children simply had not yet been brought to
Bucharest from provincial orphanages in time to catch Saturday's
flight and would be brought to their French adoptive parents within
days, the officials said.
   Many of the children were simply abandoned by their biological
parents, who were forbidden from using birth control because of
Ceausescu's plans to increase Romania's population of 23 million by
7 million by the year 2000.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The Electoral Council has scheduled
presidential elections for October and legislative elections in
July, state-run Radio Nationale said Saturday.
   The council said the elected president will be installed in
office on Feb. 7, 1991, five years after ex-dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier's fled during anti-government protests. Duvalier is now
living in France.
   The balloting will be Haiti's third attempt at general elections
since the end of Duvalier's rule in 1986.
   In the November 1987 elections, thugs supported by soldiers
attacked voters, killing at least 36 people. Then-military ruler
Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy canceled the vote and dissolved the Electoral
Council, accusing it of being controlled by foreign powers.
   Namphy organized elections in January 1988, which most voters
boycotted. Leslie Manigat was declared the winner, but Namphy
ousted him in a coup in June 1988.
   Namphy was ousted three months later in a military revolt that
brought Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril to power.
   ``We still are skeptical that free and fair elections can be
held under this government,'' conservative politician Hubert De
Ronceray, a candidate in the past two elections, told The
Associated Press Saturday.
   Radio Nationale said presidential elections will be held Oct. 28
and if no candidate wins a majority, a runoff will be held Nov. 25.
It said a first round of legislative elections are scheduled for
July 22 with a runoff on Aug. 12. Municipal and county elections
are set for April 29.
   The report said the independent nine-member Electoral Council
submitted the timetable to Avril who gave his approval Friday night.
   Members of the Electoral Council were named by leaders of the
Roman Catholic Church, labor unions, human rights organizations and
groups supported by the military government.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze on Saturday pledged to open the Soviet-Romanian border
and provide oil and gas to allow Romanians to turn up their heat
for the first winter in years.
   Shevardnadze, on a one-day visit, spent more than five hours in
talks with his Romanian counterpart, Sergiu Celac; Premier Petre
Roman; and Ion Iliescu, president of the National Salvation Front
that is running the country.
   He promised that Moscow would not interfere if Romania
established a multiparty democracy.
   Romania's interim leaders had high expectations for the visit,
the first by a senior Soviet official since Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted Dec. 22 in a popular revolt and
executed three days later.
   The Soviet chief diplomat invited Iliescu and Celac to visit
Moscow, and Iliescu told Soviet TV he planned to go this month to
``jointly discuss the fate of the Warsaw Pact.''
   Celac later issued a statement vowing that Romania would honor
its human rights commitments in accords adopted by 35 nations in
Vienna in January 1989.
   Ceausescu's regime had said it did not feel bound by the
commitments on freedom of religion and emigration.
   The Kremlin already had pledged aid to the new Romania and
confirmed Moscow would provide oil and gas to help Romania through
the winter.
   Under Ceausescu, Romania's 23 million people suffered through
winters with barely any heat or light for their homes as the
dictator redirected raw material imports to his pet
industrialization projects.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union also accepts that some
Romanian products will no longer be exported to the Soviet Union.
Ceausescu exported vast quantities of food, especially meat, to
ensure energy supplies from Moscow.
   One of the first moves by the interim leadership was to stop
food exports so it could feed deprived Romanians.
   At a 45-minute news conference after his talks, Shevardnadze
said the two countries would start discussion on opening the border
so that ``people can go without any difficulties whatsoever to make
contacts.''
   The border between Romania and Soviet Moldavia had been one of
the most tightly closed in Eastern Europe, and cultural and other
exchanges were severely restricted by frosty Soviet-Romanian
relations in the past.
   Romanians in the border region and many Soviet Moldavians had
hoped for a more open border.
   Soviet Moldavia consists largely of territory annexed from
Romania by Josef Stalin in 1940 and rewon by the Red Army in 1944
after a three-year occupation by Axis forces in World War II.
   Moldavians, whose spoken language is identical to Romanian, have
been appealing for increased independence from Moscow, and
Romania's revolution has sparked speculation they could even push
for a form of reunification.
   Asked about the possibility of reunification, Shevardnadze said
existing European treaties guarantee the territorial integrity of
all the countries of Europe and their existing borders.
   ``That is something that must be taken into account,'' he said,
without elaborating.
   Security was tight throughout Shevardnadze's visit. Half a dozen
paratroopers with helmets and automatic weapons stood outside the
conference room and at least one was posted inside the room where
the news conference was held.
   Shevardnadze said he was moved by his visit to Romania and spoke
with disdain of the deposed leader.
   ``Never before have I come to a country with such feelings of
emotion,'' as after the revolution _ the only one in Eastern Europe
that erupted in bloodshed.
   Romania's ties with Moscow had been strained for decades over
Ceausescu's maverick foreign and trade policies and, in later
years, his staunch resistance to reform.
   ``Dictatorship is not acceptable; neither a Communist
dictatorship nor a bourgeois dictatorship,'' Shevardnadze said.
   ``I can tell you that after my meetings with Ceausescu, I always
went back to Moscow with unpleasant feelings,'' he said.
   Both he and Celac denied reports of Soviet complicity in the
Romanian revolt. ``There were no contacts before the uprising,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Celac added: ``There was no conspiracy. There was no plot. There
was no plan or scheme to overthrow Ceausescu. It was an explosion
of popular discontent, a wave of indignation and revolt.''
   Shevardnadze refused to speculate about the type of government
Romania was likely to have after elections, tentatively set for
April, saying ``this is the decision of the Romanians.''
   Moscow will respect whatever system is established, he said.
   A French weekly on Saturday quoted Iliescu as denying a rumor
that he and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev were friends
dating back to their studies at Moscow State University.
   ``I have never met Gorbachev,'' the conservative Le Figaro
quoted Iliescu as saying in an interview in Bucharest.``I never had
any dealings with Gorbachev later, either.''

   Fifty Ku Klux Klan members and supporters
gathered peacefully at the state Capitol on Saturday as 2,400 law
enforcement officers kept about 100 counterdemonstrators safely
away.
   The rally took place at a time when racial tensions in the
Southeast have been exacerbated by four mail bombs directed at
judicial and civil rights targets. The bombs killed an Alabama
federal judge and a Savannah alderman.
   In the northern suburb of Cumming, an afternoon rally drew about
60 Klansmen and supporters and about 150 spectators.
   The 75-minute rally at the Capitol came off without incident.
The closest the Klan and their opponents got was a half of block,
as both groups left Capitol Hill following the rally.
   At that point, the two sides jeered each other, with KKK members
giving Nazi salutes. Opponents, who shouted and waved signs ``No
Peace for Racists'' and ``Stop Racist Terror,'' tried to push past
authorities to the Klan.
   The group then tied a small Klan figure to a fence and set it
afire, chanting as the flames engulfed the white cloth.
   ``I think burning a small figure of the Ku Klux Klan is great
when you think about all the burning images of black people in
history books,'' said Lena Shapiro, a member of the John Brown
Anti-Klan Committee. ``It's refreshing.''
   About a dozen Klansmen distributed leaflets at a Cumming
intersection for 2{ hours Saturday afternoon. Afterward about 60
Klansmen and supporters gathered at Cumming city hall for a
six-block march around the courthouse and back to city hall.
   According to state officials, the law-enforcement officers
brought in to maintain order in downtown Atlanta on Saturday
included 1,594 Georgia National Guardsmen, 300 Atlanta police
officers, 184 state troopers and 145 agents from the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation.
   Civil rights leaders and city officials had urged Atlantans to
stay away from the rally, despite an anti-Klan group's call for a
counterdemonstration.
   ``The Klan rally is not worthy of your attention,'' said Mayor
Maynard Jackson. ``Stay home, go shopping, rake leaves ... do
whatever you do on Saturdays. Leave them alone, and let them say
what they have to say to each other.''
   But Tonyalle Ross, 23, of Atlanta said she could not respect the
leaders' requests to stay home.
   ``If you don't protest, who's going to know that you're against
it?'' she said. ``We can't just sit down and ignore it. It gives
them the feeling of power.''
   Last January, a white supremacist rally and march in downtown
Atlanta turned violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators
gathered to oppose a handful of white protesters.
   Some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles toward the
demonstrators and their police and National Guard escorts, and some
law enforcement officers fought back in what critics called ``a
police riot.''

   The parents of a murder victim said
Saturday they are outraged by a legal system that paroled the
killer who police say killed their daughter and 10 other women.
   ``He should suffer like my baby did,'' said Diane Stanisci, the
mother of 29-year-old Elizabeth Gibson, hose body was found Nov. 27
outside Rochester.
   Arthur J. Shawcross, 44, was charged with murdering eight women
in the Rochester area since March 1988. Police say he is linked to
three other slayings, including Miss Gibson's. Those will be
presented to a grand jury.
   Most of the deaths have been tied to prostitution or drugs; most
of the victims had been strangled.
   Shawcross settled in Rochester after he was paroled from prison
in 1987. He was convicted of strangling an 8-year-old girl in 1972
in Watertown, 150 miles northeast of here. He served 15 years of a
25-year sentence before he was paroled on his seventh attempt.
   ``The punishment should fit the crime,'' said Bruno Stanisci,
Miss Gibson's father. ``I think that after killing that little
girl, his life should have been taken. What about the rights of the
people who are dead?''
   New York state does not have a death penalty.
   Police had been investigating the deaths or disappearances of 16
women, but now say that five of the slayings are not related to the
others.
   ``That hurts me,'' said Alnora Carter, the mother of 27-year-old
Jacqueline Dicker, whose killing last summer has not been linked to
Shawcross.
   ``If they don't find nobody that murdered my daughter, I don't
know what I'm going to do.''
   Shawcross seemed to be leading a normal life since he was
released from prison April 30, 1987, said Edward Elwin, executive
director of the state's parole division. He kept regular
appointments with parole officers and worked for a food service
company.
   ``Since he was paroled, he lived a very conforming life as far
as parole was concerned,'' Elwin said.
   Police said Shawcross became a suspect when investigators in a
state police helicopter spotted Shawcross' car close to where a
victim's body was recovered.
   Elwin said he expects a public outcry over Shawcross' parole,
but he defended the decision to release Shawcross.
   If Shawcross had not been paroled in 1987, he would have been
automatically released from prison last year because of good
behavior during his jail term.
   ``You can say, `I can hold him for another two years'. Or you
can say, `He has been good for 15 years. What good will it do to
keep him two more?''' said Elwin.
   Shawcross pleaded innocent Friday to the eight murder charges
and was ordered held without bail.
   ``I feel better knowing they got him, but I don't feel better
knowing what they're going to do with him,'' Dianne Stanisci said
in a telephone interview.
   ``He's going to go to jail and the taxpayers are going to have
to support him,'' she said.

   Manuel Antonio Noriega's federal keepers have
assured his lawyers he will not be moved from Miami any time soon
so he can assist in his defense against drug charges, one of the
lawyers said Saturday.
   The deposed Panamanian dictator was described as ``generally
upbeat'' during his first weekend in custody. U.S. marshals are
believed to be holding Noriega in the federal courthouse downtown.
   There was little visible security around the courthouse
Saturday. A handful of journalists maintained a vigil there should
authorities decide to move Noriega, who walked out of the Vatican
embassy in Panama City and into U.S. custody Jan. 3 after U.S.
forces invaded Panama on Dec. 20.
   Noriega attorney Steven Kollin said marshals assured him and
others on the defense team that Noriega won't be moved from the
Miami area any time soon because they need his help in preparing
legal motions.
   Kollin said he and attorney Frank Rubino don't expect to file
motions for about 30 days. Their first will likely seek dismissal
of the 12-count federal indictment that alleges Noriega helped
cocaine traffickers in exchange for millions of dollars.
   Noriega and his lawyers have spent hours together since he was
flown Thursday from Panama to Miami. The attorneys promised U.S.
marshals not to disclose Noriega's location, Kollin said.
   ``He's generally upbeat,'' Kollin said of his client. ``He's
working with us in preparations. There are certain essential facts
that we need to go over. He's necessary for us to go in the right
direction.''
   Noriega also faces a separate indictment in Tampa.
   Kollin said he and Noriega's other lawyers decided not to answer
questions from tidbit-hungry news media, such as what Noriega had
for lunch.
   Noriega's lawyers were not surprised at the results of a poll
published Saturday by The Miami Herald that indicated a majority of
area residents already believe Noriega is guilty.
   Of 130 Dade County residents interviewed by the newspaper, 55
percent said they believed Noriega was guilty, 40 percent said they
had no opinion and 5 percent said he was innocent.
   Kollin said he doubted other cities were different.
   ``The problem is not a change of venue in this particular case.
What it really comes down to is where do you move it?'' he asked.
``I think it was impossible for any citizen of the United States,
unless they were stone-deaf, not to have heard of this matter.''
   The Orlando Sentinel, meanwhile, quoted anonymous U.S. officials
as saying that dozens of Spanish-speaking FBI agents were flown to
Panama after the U.S. invasion to check bank accounts of suspected
American drug dealers.
   The newspaper quoted a State Department official as saying the
agents were to review bank records in ``very specific'' cases. He
would not elaborate, the newspaper said.

   A British Airways flight bound for Miami from
London made an emergency landing at Logan International Airport on
Saturday after an anonymous caller threatened that a bomb would
explode in flight.
   The Boeing 747 jet landed without incident shortly before 3
p.m., said Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the Massachusetts Port
Authority.
   The 341 passengers and 19 crew members exited by a stairway that
had been wheeled to the plane on a runway apron away from the main
terminal. No injuries were reported.
   British Airways received the threat in London, about four hours
after the plane departed, said John Lampl, an airline spokesman. An
anonymous caller said a bomb aboard the jet was set to explode at
27,000 feet, but the plane was already at 31,000 feet above
Labrador in Canada.
   ``The threat had passed,'' Lampl said, but the plane's captain
decided to divert to Boston as a precaution.
   ``The most important thing is the safety of the passengers,'' he
said.
   After the plane landed, state police searched the aircraft with
the help of explosives-sniffing canines, but they found no
immediate sign of a bomb.
   Passengers were taken to the international air terminal, where
Lampl said they were going through customs and immigration and then
would be placed on other flights to Miami.

   An American container ship and a
Panamanian tanker collided in nighttime fog 20 miles offshore from
Galveston, but no one was injured, U.S. Coast Guard officials said
Saturday.
   Fuel oil from the Margaret Lykes, a New Orleans-based container
ship, leaked slowly from a hole in the port side of the 618-foot
vessel early Saturday, said Lt. Cmdr. Frank Whipple of the Coast
Guard Marine Safety Office at Galveston.
   The bow of the Shoun Emperor, a 323-foot tanker registered in
Panama, sustained considerable damage in Friday night's collision,
but none of its cargo had spilled, Whipple said.
   ``The bow of the tank vessel is heavily damaged, as you can well
imagine, and the Margaret Lykes has got a hole on the port side,''
Whipple said. The crews, about 50 men, remained on the vessels,
neither of which was in danger of sinking.
   Coast Guard officials were en route to the scene to decide if
the vessels could be returned to the port safely, Whipple said.
   ``We're still assessing the damage to see if they can safely be
brought back without considerable leakage of fuel oil or the threat
of spilling cargo from the tanker,'' he said.
   Whipple said a vessel capable of setting up oil spill
containment equipment also was en route to the scene. But he said
``we are not certain that corralling (the leaking fuel oil) is
going to help at this point. It's very lightweight oil and
containing it is very difficult to do at sea.''
   Officials believe the tanker was headed south to Freeport and
that the Margaret Lykes was eastbound, possibly returning to
Louisiana.

   Many pregnant South Korean women are
seeking abortions because tradition holds that women born in this
lunar calendar year will have a fiery temper and face a life of
hardship, a report said.
   During the last Year of the Horse, in 1966, birth rates fell and
abortions also rose in the Asian country, the South Korean news
agency Yonhap said. Under the oriental lunar calendar system, years
are named for the animals that, according to legend, visited the
dying Buddha.
   An unprecedented number of pregnant women have asked for
sonograms and other tests to determine the sex of infants to be
born this year, the news agency said. Many women wanted abortions
when an unborn infant was indentified as a female, it said.
   Many women, refused abortions by hospitals, are expected to
visit unlicensed doctors this year to get forced miscarriages, it
said.
   Many other young wives are trying to avoid pregnancy this year,
Yonhap said.
   The Yonhap report gave no figures for this year.
   It said that in 1966, also the Year of the Horse according to
the oriental lunar calendar, the birth rate fell 27.6 percent from
a year earlier and there were 45,000 more abortions than normal.
   Abortions are illegal in South Korea. Doctors are barred from
disclosing the sex of a fetus but allowed to conduct surgery in
special cases.
   The rapid development of medical equipment has caused higher
incidences of male births, a distortion in birth patters and a
steady decline in the number of girl children. Koreans
traditionally favor a son.
   Traditionally, Koreans believe a woman born in the Year of the
Horse would have a fiery, undesirable chracter and face a life of
hardship or misfortune.

   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 17

<TEXT>
   South Korea on Saturday ridiculed a
North Korean claim that Seoul had erected a concrete border wall
akin to the Berlin Wall in the Korean demilitarized zone.
   The South Korean Defense Ministry, in a statement, accused the
North of trying to mislead world opinion by creating the false
impression that the South has built such a barrier.
   ``It is very regrettable that North Korea has made a false claim
that concrete (border) walls that do not exist must be removed as a
prerequisite to free travel,'' the statement said.
   In a New Year speech, North Korean President Kim Il Sung
proposed talks on demolishing what he said was a concrete border
wall in South Korea to ensure free travel between the two Koreas.
   Kim said North Korea has erected no barriers on its side of the
DMZ and was ready to remove ``barbed wires which mark a boundary.''
   Communist North Korea and the capitalist South, divided since
1945, technically are still in a state of war. An armistice rather
than a peace treaty ended the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The two Koreas are separated by the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ with the
demarcation line, or the border, running through the middle of the
zone. Barbed wires mark the boundary. The zone must not be
fortified by either side, and only a limited number of lightly
armed troops are authorized to police either side of the zone.
   Outside the zone, however, the border area on both sides is
sealed and heavily fortified by fences, concrete bunkers, mine
fields and hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops.
   Even inside the DMZ, the Defense Ministry statement said, North
Korea has erected five to seven fences, including an electric one,
while only a single barbed wire fence has been built along the
southern edge of the zone to prevent infiltration.

<HEAD>Artist Cancels Attempt to Squash Rat, Onlookers Chase Him From
Scene</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note the following may be offensive to some readers.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An artist called off his plan
to squash a rat between two canvases Saturday when the 55-pound
concrete block that he intended to use was missing. Angry onlookers
chased him from the scene.
   Rick Gibson of Vancouver told a crowd of about 300 people that
had gathered for his stunt that someone _ he believed animal rights
activists _ had stolen his concrete block after he loaded it onto a
truck at his home earlier Saturday.
   He said he had taken Sniffy the Rat back to the pet store where
he had bought him and had no plans to try to restage the event.
Sniffy probably will be eaten by a snake _ the reason he was kept
at the store, Gibson said.
   Gibson then suggested that the crowd in front of the Vancouver
Public Library disperse. Some onlookers then rushed toward him and
chased him to a nearby hotel.
   ``Where did the bastard go?'' cried one woman. At the hotel,
Gibson could be heard telling another to ``Let me go.''
   About a dozen police then dispersed the crowd.
   Animal rights activists earlier had tried to have the event
declared illegal. But the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals had said there was nothing illegal about killing Sniffy,
provided he died a quick and painless death.
   Before the event, Gibson had said Sniffy's remains would create
a ``thought-provoking diptych.''
   Gibson created a stir in London in 1987 when he made earrings
out of two dehydrated human fetuses as part of a sculpture. He and
a gallery owner were fined for violations of public decency.
   Moving to Vancouver earlier this year, Gibson was prevented from
staging an artistic act of cannibalism when police closed his
gallery show that featured part of a human testicle _ obtained from
a medical supply house _ that he planned to eat.

   Divers failed again Saturday to find a murder
weapon in one of Boston's most baffling and still unraveling crime
cases, as the family of the man linked to his wife's slaying came
out of seclusion to bury him.
   ``Forgive whatever wrongs he may have done,'' said the Rev.
Richard Messina during services for Charles Stuart. ``We cannot
explain why the events of the past took place and certainly we can
never understand them.''
   About 150 people attended a funeral Mass at Immaculate
Conception Roman Catholic Church, two blocks from Stuart's
childhood home in the north Boston suburb of Revere. Stuart, 29,
committed suicide Thursday as authorities sought to arrest him in
the shooting death of his pregnant wife.
   Among the mourners were Stuart's parents, his two stepsisters
and three brothers, including 23-year-old Matthew, who told police
Wednesday that his brother's story that a mugger shot him and his
wife was a fabrication.
   Stuart's mother, Dot, wept as they left the church and Matthew
supported his father, Charles Sr., as they left a chapel at
Woodlawn Cemetery.
   No plot had been designated for Stuart, and his coffin was not
expected to be interred until Monday. His wife Carol, 30, was
buried in another Boston suburb.
   Police divers, meanwhile, searched the Pines River in Revere for
the weapon used in the shootings but failed to find it. They
planned to resume their search Sunday.
   Stuart had told police that a mugger forced his way into the
couple's car Oct. 23 as they were leaving a birthing class at a
Boston hospital.
   Stuart, who was shot in the abdomen, used his car telephone to
call rescuers, who listened to sirens on approaching vehicles to
find their car in the Mission Hill neighborhood. Mrs. Stuart died
after her child was born prematurely by Caesarean section. The
infant, Christopher, died 17 days later.
   But last week, Matthew Stuart told police that his brother
instructed him to meet him in Mission Hill on the night of the
shooting. He said his brother handed over a bag containing a gun
and Mrs. Stuart's purse, apparently after the shootings had taken
place.
   The snub-nosed revolver, which Matthew Stuart said he threw into
the Pines River, is believed to be the same gun used to shoot
Stuart and his wife.
   With Matthew Stuart's help, authorities have pulled from the
river a bag containing a Gucci bag, a wallet and other personal
belongings of Mrs. Stuart. He also turned over Mrs. Stuart's
engagement ring, which her husband had claimed was stolen during
the reported attack.
   Police have said the case is still being investigated. They have
refused to comment whether there were any other suspects besides
Charles Stuart.
   The Boston Herald reported Saturday that a source close to the
Stuart family, who was not identified, said another person was with
Matthew Stuart the night of Oct. 23.
   The newspaper also cited unidentified sources who said Charles
Stuart underwent treatment for cocaine dependency while he was
hospitalized for his gunshot wound. Prosecutors, however, have
insisted that they had no indication that Stuart was using drugs.
   In a related development, Mayor Raymond Flynn said Saturday he
was proposing an investigation into leaks to the media about the
case from the police department. Prior to last week's revelations,
William Bennett, who is black, was named in news reports as a key
suspect in the crime.
   Flynn and police have been sharply criticized by leaders of the
black community, who claim that officials were too willing to
accept the story that a black man had attacked a white, suburban
couple.
   Flynn said the person who leaked Bennett's name to the media
violated grand jury proceedings and the law and he would recommend
the person's firing and prosecution if identified.
   ``The police clearly had suspicions,'' he said, but added: ``The
police never said William Bennett was the guy.''
   On Saturday, the mayor and Police Commissioner Mickey Roache met
with community leaders in the Mission Hill District and in largely
black Roxbury.

   Thousands of Mummers strutted and swished in
feathers and sequins to shouts of ``Happy New Year'' Saturday
during their better-late-than-never parade in gold-painted shoes.
   The Mummers usually stage their annual march on New Year's Day,
but high winds forced postponement this year.
   The 12-hour parade drew 20,000 Mummers and a crowd of at least
40,000, police said.
   Clouds gave way to sunshine by mid-afternoon.
   In keeping with the traditional theme song, ``Oh Dem Golden
Slippers,'' most Mummers wore gold-painted shoes as they bobbed and
swayed in elaborate costumes.
   Mummers Joe Fieger, 60, and Joe Bryson, 56, wore yellow dresses
and twirled parasols during their 50th year as participants.
   ``Fifteen years ago I made a promise to him that if he marched,
I would march,'' Fieger said. ``What I didn't know was I might end
up carrying him.''
   The parade included six comic clubs, four fancy divisions, 16
dancing musical brigades and 22 string bands.
   Mummer Tom Schrader, 25, said he would have prefered to march
New Year's Day.
   ``We're not afraid of wind. They didn't want to get their
feathers ruffled,'' he said, referring to fancy division members
who often don ostrich feathers.
   Mummery is traced to the Romans about 2,500 years ago when
masked laborers cavorted in a frenzy of fun and satire during gift
exchanging.
   The tradition reached Philadelphia in the 1600s, brought by the
Swedes, who began the holiday season visiting neighbors and banging
on pots to frighten off evil spirits.

   A Great Dane named Miss Olga will be
around for a while longer to guide her legally blind master after
the elderly man saved her life with CPR.
   Joe Kerrell followed a veterinarian's instructions over the
telephone Dec. 23, when the 6-year-old dog collapsed at the home
they share.
   ``I was ready to cry. I did cry,'' said the 83-year-old Kerrell.
``She's my bosom buddy.''
   Kerrell made a frantic call to Dr. Cliff Owen, a veterinarian in
nearby Pensacola, after Miss Olga fell to the floor and stopped
breathing. Owen instructed Kerrell to locate the dog's heart and
press firmly.
   Kerrell pumped the dog's chest for 20 minutes until Owen arrived.
   ``She was dead and Dr. Owen said I brought her back,'' Kerrell
said. ``I couldn't get along without her. I think this is the most
wonderful thing that ever happened to me.''

   A cult leader accused of murdering a
five-member family in his flock preached that Jesus would return to
Earth and destroy everyone but his followers, a minister familiar
with the cult said Saturday.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, his wife, their 19-year-old son and two of his
followers remained at large Saturday, but eight others have been
arrested in the shootings on a farm where the small cult lived
until April 1989.
   Dale Luffman, president of the northeast Ohio chapter of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, said
Lundgren worked from 1985 to 1987 at a church temple in Kirtland,
about 30 miles east of Cleveland.
   Lundgren, once a lay minister of the Reorganized Church,
conducted tours of the church's 153-year-old temple in Kirtland
when he moved here from Kansas City, Mo., Luffman said.
   Lundgren lived on church property until he began preaching
radical doctrines during tours, Luffman said. He was defrocked and
left the church with some followers to form his cult in 1987,
Luffman said.
   Several of Lundgren's followers who left the cult told
authorities that the leader had violent beliefs, which included
death threats against members of his flock, Luffman said.
   ``There were some that dropped out,'' Luffman said. ``One
alerted authorities about things that really scared him.''
   Lundgren preached to his followers, who were estimated at more
than a dozen, that Jesus would destroy anyone not inside the
historic Kirtland temple where he once worked.
   The temple was founded in 1836 by Joseph Smith, founder of the
Salt Lake City-based Mormon Church, which shares some beliefs with
the Reorganized Church, based in Independence, Mo., but is not
affiliated with it.
   Lundgren named two specific dates when Jesus was to return to
Earth, but the days came and went, Luffman said.
   ``When that moment was supposed to occur, they were to be in the
temple. Only those who got in the temple would be saved and the
unrighteous would be destroyed,'' Luffman said. ``They believed
that they were the only people God could speak to.''
   The remains of the family, including three daughters, were found
Wednesday and Thursday buried in a barn on the farm that Lundgren
rented about 1{ miles east of this northeast Ohio community.
   Authorities have tentatively identified the five as Dennis
Avery, 49; his wife, Cheryl, 42; and their three daughters, Trina,
15; Rebecca, 13; and Karen, 7. Investigators believe they were
killed in mid-April.
   In addition to being shot, the victims' eyes were covered with
duct tape, and some had their hands and feet bound with duct tape,
Kirtland Fire Chief Richard A. Martincic said Saturday.
   On Friday, Lake County Prosecutor Steven C. LaTourette said the
Averys apparently were killed because of Lundgren's interpretation
of a prophecy that members had to be sacrificed before the group
could relocate to the wilderness.
   Luffman, however, said he did not believe the slayings were a
sacrifice but probably came after a dispute over money, sex or fear
the family would leave the cult.
   An eighth cult member was arrested Saturday, but Lundgren, his
wife, Alice, their 19-year-old son Damon and two other cult members
remained at large.
   Sharon Bluntschley, 31, of Independence, Mo., turned herself
into Michigan State Police in Bay City, Mich., Saturday afternoon,
said George Rodriguez, of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.
   Ms. Bluntschley is charged with conspiracy and complicity to
commit murder and kidnapping.
   In all, 13 people were charged with murder or conspiracy in the
shooting.
   Kirtland Police Chief Dennis Yarborough said his investigation
of the house where Lundgren lived began in April 1988 when he heard
reports of paramilitary activity and civil rights violations. No
charges were filed, Yarborough said.
   Local businessmen who knew the Lundgren family say they seemed
ordinary.
   ``He (Lundgren) was always fishing and hunting, and always had
people around him,'' said Ray Byers, owner of Kirtland Hardware.
``He was a religious guy when I first knew him. He was dressed real
well.''
   Another Kirtland resident, Doris Straka, said the Lundgrens kept
to themselves. ``They didn't associate much with the community,''
she said.
   She said the Lundgrens renovated the farmhouse and gave it a new
coat of paint, landscaped the yard, revived an orchard, and set up
a gymnasium in the barn where the bodies were found.
   Lundgren left the area in April 1989 and the cult disbanded,
Luffman said.
   Jeffrey and Damon Lundgren were charged with five counts each of
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping. Alice Lundgren was
charged with five counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder,
five counts of kidnapping and five counts of complicity in the
commission of aggravated murder.

   A gunman wearing a bandanna
reminiscent of Old West-era bandits hopped aboard a stopped Conrail
freight train, robbed the crew and fled on foot before dawn
Saturday, a sheriff's dispatcher said.
   The man reportedly wore a red or blue handkerchief tied around
his head and partially concealing his face, said Gale Zelms, a
dispatcher for the Ottawa County Sheriff's Department. No one was
injured, she said.
   Armed with a shotgun, the man boarded the freight train at 4:50
a.m. and robbed two crew members of their personal belongings, said
Conrail spokeswoman Barbara Vasco. She said it was not known what
was taken.
   The 60-car train from Chicago to Newark, N.J., had stopped to
check an air leak, the sheriff's department said. Ms. Vasco said
the train was carrying miscellaneous consumer goods.

   A four-engine corporate jet crashed on takeoff
Saturday, killing the pilot and coming to rest only about 30 yards
from a busy city street bordering Miami International Airport.
   The first firefighters to arrive found the co-pilot lying on the
tarmac, apparently after escaping the Jet Star L-329 under his own
power, said Metro-Dade fire spokesman Bill Glass.
   The jet, which was carrying aircraft parts to Dallas-Fort Worth,
scratched a track across airport property and caught fire before
stopping on grass near the main airport access road, he said.
   The wreckage with the pilot's body inside stood intact near the
northeast corner of the airport but was almost completely charred
by flames.
   ``It looks like it crashed on departure, and it looks like it's
about a half-mile off the end of the runway,'' said Arlene Salac,
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman in Atlanta.
   The names of the two pilots were withheld. No others were aboard.
   The co-pilot was flown by helicopter to Jackson Memorial
Hospital and was in stable condition in the emergency room, said
Susan Cataldo, administrator on duty. Ms. Cataldo said he was about
35 years old.
   A team from the National Transportation Safety Board arrived on
the scene within two hours to investigate, which briefly shut down
the runway, said airport spokesman Chris Mangos.
   No information was immediately available on the aircraft owner.

<HEAD>Harari Describes Involvement In Panama, Investigation Demanded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An Israeli legislator demanded Saturday that
Parliament investigate the role played in Panama by Mike Harari,
who has been identified by U.S. officials as a top aide to Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens' Rights Movement said in a
statement that ``an attempt to present Harari as an ordinary,
innocent businessman in Panama...is more ridiculous than
ridiculous.''
   ``There is no doubt that Harari was Noriega's right-hand man,''
said Sarid, a member of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee. He said the committee should investigate
Harari's role in Panama.
   Sarid's statement was carried by the national Itim news agency.
   Harari, once a senior official at Israel's Mossad intelligence
agency, denied in an Israel Television interview broadcast Friday
that he had served as security adviser to the dictator.
   ``I want to tell you: I'm not Noriega's adviser and have not
been in the past...I have not been in charge of his business
affairs, I have not been in charge or instructed his forces, I have
not organized his personal security. I'm just a private man who
deals in trade,'' Harari said.
   On Saturday, the television broadcast more of the interview but
indicated it had been censored.
   Harari said he arrived in Panama by chance in early 1968,
planning to spend 24 to 48 hours in the country.
   ``A Jewish friend offered me to meet a young major, in this case
it was Omar Torrijos (Herrera),'' Harari said, adding that Torrijos
was described as a person interested in Israel.
   Harari said he was reluctant, but then ``I was pressured and
asked...and when I met this personality, and I stress personality,
chemistry was at work between us, and instead of 15 minutes I spent
seven hours with him. We became friends.''
   ``Several months after this young major was promoted to the rank
of colonel and then led a coup in October 1968,'' deposing
President Arnulfo Arias, Harari said.
   He said he continued to visit Torrijos several times a year.
During one of the visits, in 1980, Torrijos introduced him to
Noriega. Shortly after, Torrijos was killed in an accident, and
Noriega came to power three years later.
   Harari said he voluntarily resigned from Israeli ``government
service'' in 1980 and became a private businessman.
   ``When I resigned, I decided not to deal with intelligence and
security, because this is what I was doing in the past, and not to
engage in weapons trade...I tried to deal in agriculture, promote
housing and trade projects, and (sell) equipment but only civilian
equipment,'' he said.
   Harari described his relationship with Noriega as ``friendly''
and said:
   ``I knew Noriega as a wise, energetic, patriotic man, a cunning
man who has an oustanding ability to survive, to make friends, to
organize, to hold the reigns of power and coordinate state affairs.'
   ``Noriega is an American creature...The Americans have created
and developed and raised him. Noriega was pro-American and still is
pro-American, I think, in spite of his present position,'' he said.
   Harari indicated he thought the United States was behind media
reports about his involvement in Panama, which he termed ``a
campaign of disinformation and psychological war against me.''
   He denied newspaper reports about his alleged trips to Columbia
and Nicaragua, saying he had never visited these countries and
never supplied Israeli-made weapons to Panama. Harari also denied
he knew anything about Noriega's alleged drug dealings.
   He attacked the media for reporting about his activities with
the Mossad, saying the reports could turn him into a target for
revenge actions.
   According to Israeli reports, Harari, 62, was Mossad's chief of
operations when he headed the unit trying to kill the leader of the
Palestinian Black September group that massacred 11 Israeli
athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
   By mistake, agents killed a Moroccan-born waiter. Six of the
Israeli agents involved in the operation were then arrested by
Norwegian police.
   Asked what his plans were, Harari said in the interview: ``I
will continue to be a businessman. The world is big.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush and his wife, Barbara,
celebrated their 45th wedding anniversary Saturday, marking the
occasion with a quiet day at home before having dinner with friends
and an evening at the theater.
   The Bushes tend to honor such occasions without ballyhoo and do
not exchange gifts, aides said. However, they said the couple
agreed to remodel some rooms at their Kennebunkport, Maine, home as
a mutual gift. Both declined to comment when asked through aides
for a comment on their 45 years of marriage.
   On Saturday night they dined with family members and friends at
the White House and went to the Kennedy Center to see the play, ``A
Tuna Christmas.''
   When the Bushes entered the theater, the audience stood and
applauded enthusiastically. Bush, beaming, motioned with his hands
for everyone to take their seats.
   ``They don't make a big deal out of it,'' one aide said.
   The Bushes usually spend the weekend at the presidential retreat
at Camp David, Md. But they stayed in Washington this weekend in
part because Mrs. Bush is undergoing 10 days of radiation treatment
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center for an eye ailment she suffers.
   Saturday was her fourth consecutive day of receiving the
10-minute radiation dose, which aides say causes her no side
effects or curtailment of activity.
   The eye condition is a result of an immune system affliction
called Graves disease. It has caused her months of double vision
and tearing.
   Mrs. Bush took her usual one-mile swim in the White House
outdoor pool on Saturday, according to her press secretary Anna
Perez.
   Later she looked perky in a festive multicolored dress at the
theater.
   The president spent part of the day working in the Oval Office.
   On Friday night, the Bushes hosted a group of friends to see the
movie, ``Always,'' in the White House theater, said Perez.
   The Bushes were teen-age sweethearts who married Jan. 6, 1945,
at the First Presbyterian Church in Mrs. Bush's hometown of Rye,
N.Y. The wedding took place while Bush was on leave from his
service as a Navy pilot, a few months after he was shot down over
the Pacific.
   The couple met at a high school Christmas dance at a Greenwich,
Conn., country club when she was 16 and he was 17.
   Today, the president, in reference to his wife's thick, wavy
gray hair, teasingly calls Mrs. Bush ``the silver fox.''
   Asked recently why he has fared so well in public opinion polls
during the first year of his presidency, he replied that part of it
was due to his very popular wife.
   Throughout his career in the oil business and then in various
government jobs, including congressman from Texas, director of the
CIA, chairman of the Republican National Committee and vice
president, the Bushes have moved 29 times during their marriage.

   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega said
Saturday that CIA-trained ``specialized commandos'' of the Contra
rebels are inside Nicaragua and he expects them to increase attacks
to disrupt elections.
   Ortega told a news conference that a New Year's day ambush in a
remote part of northeastern Nicaragua, during which two Roman
Catholic nuns were killed and a third nun and a bishop were
wounded, was part of a Contra pattern of ``intimidation'' to
disrupt the elections Feb. 25.
   The three nuns belonged to the Order of St. Agnes, based in Fond
Du Lac, Wis. One of the victims, Sister Maureen Courtney, was
buried Friday in her hometown of Milwaukee.
   Contra leaders have denied their men were involved in the attack.
   ``Over the last two months very specialized commandos have been
strengthened'' and have begun ``terrorist actions under cover of
the freedoms of the electoral framework,'' Ortega said.
   The defense minister, who is the brother of President Daniel
Ortega, said the Contras are mounting the terrorist campaign
because they fear the opposition coalition will lose.
   ``This is the central objective ... that the mercenaries
(Contras) under the direction of the CIA will develop throughout
until Feb. 25,'' he said.
   Daniel Ortega is seeking re-election as president, running
mainly against newspaper publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who
is backed by the 14-party National Opposition Union.
   The president advanced the election date from November and
promised the process will be free and fair.
   U.S. Sen. Christopher Dodd said Saturday that observers from the
United Nations told him the electoral process is ``technically fine
although there are some problems.''
   The Connecticut Democrat, winding up a two-day visit, did not
elaborate. The campaign has spawned several violent confrontations
between government backers and opposition activists.
   Defense Minister Ortega estimated that some 6,500 rebels are
active inside and outside Nicaragua, out of a total force of about
7,850. Of the total, he said about 2,600 remain within Nicaragua
and another 4,000 are in jungle camps in southern Honduras.
   Those figures conflict with previous government estimates that
the Contras had a total of 12,000 fighters, 6,000 of them inside
Nicaragua.
   Humberto Ortega insisted that ``as long as we fail to reach a
negotiated solution to the Central American conflict, the threat of
a U.S. invasion to Nicaragua remains.''
   Should such an intervention as in Panama occur in Nicaragua, he
said ``here the cost would be different, it's another situation''
and ``here the people are ready to fight.''
   ``It is not logical'' for the United States to invade Nicaragua,
he addmitted, ``But when all the logic indicated that a step like
that (in Panama) would not be taken, against all logic the United
States did it.''

   Character actor Arthur Kennedy, a
five-time Academy Award nominee who won a Tony Award for his stage
portrayal of Biff in ``Death of a Salesman,'' died of cancer, a
family friend said Saturday. He was 75.
   Kennedy died Friday night at a Branford hospice, where he was
admitted in October, said Allan Nixon, a longtime friend.
   Kennedy was at home on both stage and screen, and among his most
memorable roles was the crusty foreign correspondent Jackson
Bentley in the 1962 film classic ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   Kennedy was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but he
never won. He earned a Tony in the Broadway production of Arthur
Miller's ``Death of a Salesman'' and a New York Film Critics Award
for best actor in the 1951 movie ``Bright Victory,'' Nixon said.
   Born John Arthur Kennedy on Feb. 17, 1914, in Worcester, Mass.,
Kennedy attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology in
Pittsburgh. He was brought to Hollywood by James Cagney, who saw
him perform on stage in Los Angeles.
   He made his film debut in 1940 as the prodigy brother for whom
Cagney sacrifices all in ``City for Conquest.''
   Kennedy worked with Ronald Reagan at Warner Bros. Inc. during
World War II, appearing with Reagan and Errol Flynn in ``Desperate
Journey,'' a 1942 film about three prisoners of war in Nazi Germany
who fight their way to freedom.
   Among his other film credits were ``The Glass Menagerie,''
``Peyton Place,'' ``Elmer Gantry'' and ``High Sierra.''
   In the late 1940s, Kennedy achieved prominence as a character
actor in Miller plays that included ``The Crucible'' and ``All My
Sons.''
   Kennedy received Academy Award nominations for his film
appearances in ``Champion'' (1949), ``Peyton Place'' (1957), ``Some
Came Running'' (1959), ``Trial'' (1955) and ``Bright Victory''
(1951).
   Kennedy lived for many years in Los Angeles and moved to
Savannah, Ga., in 1986, Nixon said.
   He once told reporters he did not have much interest in
contemporary films and did not admire the actors of today, although
his daughter, Laurie Kennedy, works as an actress in New York.
   ``I think they're accomplishing nothing, playing the same part
over and over again, generally speaking,'' Kennedy said. ``It has
nothing to do with acting and it doesn't add up to much. They don't
gamble with their careers.''
   Kennedy, who is survived by his daughter, was to be buried
alongside his late wife, Mary, at his farm in Nova Scotia, Nixon
said.

   A man on a motorcycle shot and killed an
adviser to President Virgilio Barco as the adviser waited at a
stoplight in Medellin, and a bomb blast killed a local mayor and
three other people, police said Saturday.
   Late Saturday, a car bomb exploded in Bogota outside the offices
of a businessman who drug traffickers abducted Dec. 20. Three
people were injured, police said.
   The presidential adviser, Roberto Lozano Suarez, was shot three
times as he waited in his car at the stoplight in Medellin on
Friday, national police headquarters in Bogota said in a news
release.
   Two other men in the car were not hurt, police said.
   Lozano was shot in the head, the neck and the chest, and died
before he could be taken to a hospital four blocks away, the police
said.
   Lozano, 42, was a land reform adviser to Barco for the banana
growing region of Uraba in northwest Colombia. The police
communique said it is not known why Lozano was killed.
   The Uraba area has been torn by violence in the last year as
labor unions try to organize banana plantation workers. Right wing
death squads have killed six union organizers, and there has been
heavy fighting between leftist guerrillas and the army in the
region.
   The car bomb exploded late Saturday in northern Bogota, outside
the offices of Alvarro Diego Montoya's financial services company.
Montoya is the son of presidential adviser German Montoya, Barco's
closest confidant.
   He was kidnapped Dec. 20 while leaving his ofice.
   The explosion came hours after a communique, supposedly from
drug traffickers, said the traffickers would kill Montoya unless
four people arrested by Colombia's secret police are freed soon.
   The bomb destroyed half a dozen stores, broke windows in a
three-block radius and knocked out power to the area.
   A police lieutenant, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
three people were injured but none seriously.
   In the northeastern state of Norte de Santander, Mayor Carlos J.
Torrado, of the town of Abrego, and three other people died
Saturday in an ambush by leftist guerrillas, the national police
said. Abrego is 250 miles northeast of Bogota.
   The four died when a bomb exploded beside the road on which they
were driving, the police communique said.
   The victims included the mayor's son, William Torrado, a
candidate for mayor of Abrego in elections in March.
   The identities of the other two people were not known.

   President Bush is sending Vice President Dan
Quayle on a mission of ``very, very important diplomacy'' to repair
relations with Latin nations, as he vows he is ``not seeking a
deal'' with Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush said he will dispatch Quayle to reverse the negative
reaction to the military invasion of Panama, which was roundly
deplored in Central and South America.
   The president, during a White House news conference Friday, also
said the reconstruction of Panama's economy will be a ``major
priority'' for his administration.
   It was learned Friday that the administration is considering a
range of possibilities to help the ravaged country, including: new
housing for people left homeless; helping Panama pay its $543
million in foreign debt; getting other nations involved in the
recovery effort; and facilitating loans for businesses.

   A federal appeals court threw out the
nation's first damage award in a smoker-death case and ordered a
new trial, leaving lawyers for both sides haggling over who emerged
the winner.
   The ruling by the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday
set the stage for new and expanded litigation against cigarette
manufacturers, anti-smoking forces claimed.
   The appeals court overturned a lower court's damage judgment,
which would have made Liggett Group Inc. pay the family of smoker
who died of cancer $400,000. The lower court found that Liggett _
which makes Chesterfield and L&amp;M cigarettes _ had advertised its
cigarettes as safe.
   Attorneys for three cigarette manufacturers claimed victory,
citing the reversal of the award, which restored their 35-year
no-loss record in such cases. But their opponents stressed a part
of the ruling in which the court reinstated broader claims that
weren't fully considered in the first trial.

   A prosecutor accused of inventing a story
about two men trying to assassinate him was dejected because he
feared he wouldn't be reappointed, a top aide said.
   Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell, now in a psychiatric
hospital, hadn't gotten any indication on his future from the
state's governor-elect, the prosecutor's first assistant, Dennis G.
Wixted, said Friday.
   ``He was extremely disappointed at the prospect of not being
reappointed and was sometimes very sad, quiet and seemingly
depressed about it,'' Wixted said.
   The gun-toting prosecutor, known for accompanying detectives on
drug busts, resigned and checked into a psychiatric hospital after
he was caught fabricating the story, state Attorney General Peter
N. Perretti said Friday.

   Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.,
denying government charges he plundered his own thrift, is
defiantly accusing the government of driving his Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association into bankruptcy.
   Keating, who is asking a federal court to overturn the
government's seizure of Lincoln, said the Irvine, Calif., thrift
would be operating at a profit today if the government hadn't
interfered in his business, eventually taking it away from him.
   ``They took away an association with $5.5 billion in assets and
they were supposed to have some reason to do that,'' Keating told
reporters Friday after completing nearly six hours of testimony
before U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin.
   ``This company (Lincoln) made money. In my opinion it was well
managed. In my opinion it would have survived. In my opinion there
would have been, under the proper handling by the regulator, no
losses,'' he said on the steps of the federal courthouse.
