   For days, Lee Barr Sr. has seen
occasional falling snow when he looks out his window in the
northwest Alaska village of Kiana. In a couple of weeks, he said,
the Kobuk River will be ice.
   It's hard for him to imagine what his serviceman son, Marvin, is
experiencing in the hot desert of Saudi Arabia.
   ``He's doing good so far - he says he's getting used to it,''
Barr said of the 21-year-old Marine, one of several Alaska Eskimos
stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   Marvin's first letter home arrived recently. He said he missed
his mother's baking and native food. His father laughs at the
thought of smoked salmon and dried caribou meat in Saudi Arabia.
   ``He said it was kind of warm - and it must have been hot down
there if he says warm,'' his father said in a telephone interview.
``When he talks about something he can't make things sound bad.
He's always been like that.''
   Marvin is one of Lee and Viola Barr's eight children and has
been a Marine for nearly four years. He has been in Saudi Arabia
for about a month.
   ``It was kind of hard at first, I guess,'' said his father.
``The heat and wondering what they were going to do - whether they
were going to have action.''
   ``It's kind of hard for us too, wondering.''
   Lee Barr hopes his son and all American military personnel will
come home soon. He doesn't think they should be in Saudi Arabia to
begin with.
   ``It's just for the money,'' he said of the American military
presence in the Persian Gulf. ``There's a lot of other things that
need to be done. The people that are starving, people who are sick
- those things we just ignore and we're getting into somebody's
business.''
   The Barrs' neighbors, Lorenze and Nellie Schuerch, have two sons
in the Marines, but neither has gone to Saudi Arabia yet.
   One of them, 20-year-old Vincent, is home on leave for 20 days
from his base at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
   Vincent Schuerch said he's has been hunting and helping out
around home, but is ready to go back when needed. He'd like to see
Saudi Arabia.
   ``If the opportunity came to see a different country, yes, I
would like to go,'' he said. ``Just to say I've been down there.''
   His mother supports the U.S. action in the Middle East but hopes
things settle down before her boys are sent over.
   ``My concern is the possibility of chemical warfare,'' she told
the Arctic Sounder newspaper in Kotzebue.
   ``If that doesn't happen, we still have that heat in Saudi
Arabia. Living in the Arctic all of their lives, and then going to
120-degree Saudi Arabia heat, I don't know how anybody can adjust
to that. I don't know how an Eskimo can adjust to that.''

<HEAD>Sexual Problems in Priesthood Expected To Get Airing at Vatican
Synod</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 200 bishops from around the world
gather in Rome this weekend for a synod expected to consider the
issue of sex and the Roman Catholic priesthood.
   Pope John Paul II called the assembly of 238 bishops to discuss
the formation of priests in today's world. An advisory body, it
will make recommendations to him at the end of the monthlong
meeting, which starts Sunday.
   The church's rules that priests be celibate and foresake
marriage are not expected to be subjects up for debate, according
to church sources involved in preparations for the meeting. John
Paul has shown no indications the rules might be changed under his
papacy.
   But a major concern of the bishops is finding and training
candidates able to live up to the priestly vows of poverty,
chastity and obedience.
   Several sexual scandals involving churchmen have made headlines
in recent months:
   -The archbishop of Atlanta, Eugene A. Marino, resigned July 10
after revelations of a two-year ``intimate relationship'' with a
young woman singer and lay minister.
   -A report in July by a church-appointed commission in
Newfoundland said priests had sexually abused boys in the Canadian
province for more than a decade and that the church had failed to
stop it. The archbishop, Alphonsus Penney, accepted responsibility
and offered his resignation to the pope.
   Such in-house problems are usually handled with great discretion
by the Vatican. It has never commented publicly on the Marino case,
announcing only that he resigned for reasons of health.
   But the Vatican has issued several documents this year
expressing concern over the qualifications of candidates for the
priesthood, particularly at a time when the church is trying to
increase the number of priests and nuns.
   The paper bluntly declared that aspiring priests and nuns must
overcome sexual desires that would break their vows of chastity.
   It said those unable to overcome their homosexual tendencies or
who maintain it is possible to ``adopt a third way, living in an
ambiguous state between celibacy and marriage'' must be dismissed
from religious life.
   And it suggested that psychological testing can be useful in
determining sexual problems in candidates.
   ``I don't think anyone would say it was easy to be celibate,''
said the Rev. Howard Bleichner, director of the Department for
Priestly Formation of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
in Washington, D.C.
   But he said the highly publicized failures of priests did not
reflect a problem with the nature of the priesthood.
   ``If a prominent man is unfaithful in marriage, I wouldn't take
that as a reason to re-think the institution of marriage,''
Bleichner said.
   While the number of worldwide ordinations has been growing after
hitting a decade low in 1979, the numbers are still down in the
United States and Western Europe.
   Bleichner said students in the past four years of U.S. seminary
numbered 3,698 this year, compared with 7,855 in 1968.
   ``The question in our society is of long-term commitment.
Examples of that are becoming increasingly rare. Look at the
break-up of marriages.''
   A 1988 report by the U.S. bishops found that many of the
nation's priests were overworked, lonely and sexually troubled. It
contended that the mandatory celibacy is a major reason why priests
leave.
   The American bishops, Bleichner said, are looking forward to
hearing the experiences on priestly training from other countries.
   There are clearly great differences in experiences from country
to country, brought home by two bishops attending a Vatican news
conference on the synod.
   Cardinal Lucas Moreira Neves of Sao Salvador da Bahia, Brazil,
lamented the ``frightening lack'' of priests in his diocese, noting
there were 340 to serve the 3 million people.
   Bishop Henryk Myzinski of Wloclawek in the pope's native Poland
said he had 590 priests for 1.1 million faithful.
   The U.S. bishops will be represented by Cardinal Joseph
Bernardin of Chicago, Cardinal James Hickey of Washington, D.C.,
Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati and Bishop John Marshall
of Burlington, Vt., who headed a study of U.S. seminaries in the
early 80s.
   The pope, who appoints 15 percent of the delegates, named Bishop
Harry Flynn of Lafayette, La., Bishop Robert Brom of San Diego and
Bishop Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh, all former seminary rectors.

<HEAD>Saudis Praise U.S. Troops' Behavior</HEAD>

   Good guidance, limited personal
contact and no booze - whatever the reasons, American troops are on
their best behavior in Saudi Arabia, and the locals are impressed.
   In the eight weeks since the first U.S. military forces were
deployed in Operation Desert Shield, officials said there have been
no reported criminal incidents and no serious insults to Saudi
culture - things that American and Saudi officials had most feared.
   Despite the presence of more than 150,000 foreigners, most of
them armed, only one Saudi is reported to have died in an armed
forces-related incident, a man killed Sept. 25 when his taxi
collided with a Marine Corps pickup. The accident is under
investigation.
   From top generals to GIs, Americans say they have found the
Saudis to be friendly, hospitable and tolerant of ignorance about
their desert kingdom and its traditions.
   For their part, numerous Saudis say the American soldiers appear
to have been well advised on what to expect and how to behave.
   ``They're strangers in a strange land. They know it, and they
act like it,'' said a Saudi who has a Western perspective from
several years of living abroad.
   ``Some of them seem even overly sensitive. In the briefings
they're told not to say things like `hey, dude,' because dude is
Arabic for worm. But I doubt whether many Saudis would even
understand what they meant.''
   U.S. commander Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf said in a recent
interview that he encounters ``every day ... a new aspect of
cultural differences,'' and tries to work with the Saudis to
``figure out a commonsense, intelligent way'' to solve problems.
   One area of concern is the mailing of packages containing
alcohol, religious articles and other materials prohibited by Saudi
law.
   But even fears about this have proved generally groundless, U.S.
officials say.
   A heck showed only three minor incidents in which Saudi customs
officials seized a jar of whiskey, a bottle of vodka and three
copies of Playboy magazine, said a U.S. spokesman, Navy Cmdr. David
Knox.
   Another serviceman was investigated after his wife sent a
package with three bottles of liquor, but no charges were filed.
   Americans, and some Saudis, say the absence of alcohol is
probably a major factor in explaining the troops' exemplary
behavior.
   ``There's no R-and-R in the Saudi cities ... no way for them to
raise hell,'' said the former Saudi expatriate. ``When that doesn't
go on, you don't have the things that create resentment.''
   There have been some incidents of misunderstanding or affronts
to the Saudis, but very few involving religion, the most sensitive
aspect of Saudi culture.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Jordan's King Hussein have
sought in speeches to persuade Moslems that American troops are
defiling Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina, which
non-Moslems are not allowed to visit.
   Saudi leaders scoff at the claim.
   ``The foreigners are 1,000 miles from the holy places,'' said a
Saudi diplomatic source. ``If anything, King Hussein needs a crash
course in Saudi geography.''
   A Saudi prince who also spoke on condition of anonymity said he
hoped the presence of Americans ``will lead to us understanding
each other better.''
   That has not always been easy.
   When American civilians in the Dhahran area put on an amateur
stage show for the troops, it lasted only one performance.
   The Saudis complained that female performers showed too much
leg. Privately, they were said to hve felt that television
coverage ``flaunted'' the event in their faces.
   Saudi citizens also complained to Prince Mohammed Bin Fahd,
governor of the Eastern Province and son of King Fahd, about U.S.
troops carrying their M-16 rifles in the streets of Dhahran and
nearby Khobar.
   U.S. military officials quickly expressed regrets and said they
would brief troops again on weapons decorum.
   There were reports, too, that some Saudi women were upset over
the presence of American women in uniform, fearing they were here
to steal their men.
   ``That was just women's gossip,'' said the Saudi who has lived
abroad. ``The educated people have been pleasantly surprised by the
conduct of the Americans.
   ``The thing that's impressed our people most is how polite they
are. These are pretty young kids. I almost feel sorry for them,
being so patient and saying `thank you' all the time.''

<TEXT>
   As Germany rushes toward
unification, it is also becoming the promised land for tens of
thousands of people swarming into the country to escape poverty in
the Third World and Eastern Europe.
   The influx is further strapping West Germany, already
hard-pressed to come up with the tens of billions of dollars needed
to rescue East Germany from economic catastrophe.
   German unification, which will formally take place Wednesday,
appears to have given a boost to the pace of arrivals. Authorities
expect a record number of 200,000 political asylum-seekers this
year. Last year, the figure stood at 120,000.
   Last year, West Germany became the new home for 350,000 ethnic
German immigrants from Eastern Europe. About 500,000 East Germans
resettled across the border in 1989 and in the early months of
1990.
   Authorities are aware that many refugees are seeking a brighter
economic future, even if they say they are fleeing political
persecution.
   They are trying to stem the tide. But it won't be easy.
   ``All they have to do to stay here is make it believable that
they are foreign and that they are politically persecuted,'' said
Volker Moeser, who runs a government reception center just outside
Frankfurt for seekers of political asylum.
   The center, in Schwalbach, is housing about 850 refugees, and
dozens of 12-bed tents have been put up to deal with the influx.
   The opening of East European borders has contributed
dramatically to the increase.
   Once registered, asylum applicants settle down to wait until
authorities decide whether to recognize them as political refugees
- a process that can take five years. Only about 3 percent receive
refugee status, but the statistics don't seem to be a deterrent.
   At the Schwalbach camp's cafeteria, Poles and Romanians mingled
with Turks, Ghanaians, Pakistanis, Somalis, Afghanis and a variety
of other nationals as they lined up to buy cheap lunch.
   Outside a tent, a Romanian gypsy family of 13 enjoyed a recent
sunny day by relaxing on a blanket. The head of the clan, its only
male, made a few declarations of support for the new Romanian
authorities and claims of past persecution by Securitate secret
police.
   Then he talked about why he really brought the family to
Germany.
   ``One day they closed the factory and I lost my job. There is no
future in Romania,'' said the man, who gave his name only as
Novakovic and said he was from Timisoara.
   In the latest twist, West Germany suddenly faces the prospect of
Soviet deserters as well. Officials have expressed fears that many
of the 360,000 Soviet soldiers stationed in East Germany may ask
for asylum rather than return to a bleak future in their homeland
as the troops are pulled out under German unification agreements.
   Eight Soviet soldiers deserted in August and 26 more applied for
asylum in the central Hesse state in recent weeks, some coming over
with their wives.
   Also, Bonn officials have temporarily halted the immigration of
Soviet Jews in order to prevent a virtual stampede. The West German
consulate in Kiev alone has received 10,000 applications.
   The rush of new arrivals from all over is stretching social
services to the limit. Communities have been refusing to accept the
refugees because they lack housing, or even sending them to East
Germany.
   But East Germany itself still has to persuade 80,000 workers
from Vietnam, Cuba and Mozambique to return home. Citizens of East
bloc countries once had free access to East Germany, but visa
requirements have been tightened.
   In some Third World countries, newspapers carry advertisements
touting the advantages of seeking political asylum in West Germany.
The ads are placed by rings that then organize the trips for a
hefty fee.
   Some officials think that only legitimate asylum-seekers should
be allowed to cross the borders. They also want the paperwork
speeded up and those refused asylum to be expelled immediately.
   The federal government's blueprint calls for aid at the source.
Under the proposal, Germany would help build housing and create
jobs in poor countries in an attempt to keep potential
asylum-seekers from leaving.
   ``We want a larger Germany to remain friendly to foreigners,''
said Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.

   A secretive buyer paid a record $14.3
million for a 15-room ocean front estate in this resort city.
   Wilson and Hilda Lucom sold their six-acre estate to Ocean Bay
Holding Ltd., showed county records that wer filed this week.
   Ocean Bay was the agent for an undisclosed buyer, who will
likely raze existing buildings to put up a mansion, said Carol
Digges, the Lucoms' real estate agent.
   ``The main house on the property is a modest ranch built in the
1950s,'' Digges said. ``It has no architectural significance. When
you buy a piece of property of that value, the natural thing to do
is to erect a sizable mansion.''
   Also facing the wrecking ball are two guest houses, a swimming
pool, tennis court, fountain, cabana and dock.
   Casa Apava, which held the record for Palm Beach County real
estate, sold for $14.2 million in 1987. Donald Trump paid $10
million for the historic Mar-a-Lago estate, including furniture, in
1985.

   Excalibur Automobile Corp., the maker of
neoclassic luxury cars fancied by well-heeled collectors, has filed
for court protection from creditors.
   Excalibur President Scott Dennison said court papers were filed
this week under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as
negotiations continued with two suitors interested in buying the
company.
   The company stopped production at its suburban West Allis plant
in June. As of Aug. 14, Excalibur had $4.7 million in assets and
$3.9 million in debts, the company said in documents filed in
federal bankruptcy court.
   Excalibur luxury cars typically sell for $75,000 to $150,000.
   Debts secured by mortgages amounted to about $2.4 million.
Unsecured debts totaled about $1.5 million.

   A vocational school named after former
Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr. has decided to get a new name now that Moore
is serving a prison sentence for political corruption.
   ``I don't think it's good for our students to be looking at it
as a name for a school,'' Roane County Schools Superintendent C.N.
Evans said. ``I would just as soon not name any type of building
after anyone.''
   The administrative council at the Arch A. Moore Jr.
Vocational-Technical &amp; Adult Education Center voted this month to
drop Moore's name. The council is asking the public for suggestions
for a new name.
   Moore, a three-term Republican, pleaded guilty in May to one
count each of obstruction of justice, extortion and mail fraud and
two counts of tax fraud. In August, he began a 5-year, 10-month
sentence at a federal prison in Montgomery, Ala.

<HEAD>Section Of Berlin Wall Installed at Westminster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FULTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A section of the Berlin Wall was installed on
the campus of Westminster College, where Winston Churchill gave his
famous 1946 speech describing an ``Iron Curtain'' dividing the
world.
   Churchill's granddaughter, Edwina Sandys, used a 32-foot wide
section of the dismantled wall to create a sculpture she calls
``Breakthrough.''
   Ms. Sandys, daughter of Churchill's eldest daughter, Diane, was
on hand Thursday to watch as construction crews used a crane to
lower slabs of the wall near a statue of her grandfather.
   Sandys, a New York sculptor, said she wanted the work at
Westminster because it was here that Churchill gave the speech that
outlined the developing Cold War era of East-West conflict that
started after World War II and ended last year.
   ``I feel the wall is really the physical embodiment of the Iron
Curtain,'' she said. ``I'm really pleased to have it here. It's
really a perfect fit, the whole thing.
   ``First and foremost, it's a piece of art, but also it's a
political statement,'' she said. ``Sometimes they intertwine.''
   Churchill came to Fulton on March 5, 1946, with President
Truman. In his speech at Westminster he warned of new problems
facing the world after the Allied victory in World War II.
   In the best-known passage, he said, ``A shadow has fallen upon
the scene so lately lighted by Allied victory. . . . From Stettin
in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has
descended across the Continent.''
   The 10-foot-high sculpture has sections cut out, in the shape of
a man and woman, through which people can walk. One side is covered
with graffiti left by West Berliners after the wall went up in
1962.
   After Ms. Sandys approached East German officials in February
about her idea for the sculpture, they allowed her to survey the
wall and choose the sections she wanted. Those she took had been in
an area frequented by artists, she said.
   ``I chose these sections out of 200,'' she said, ``because I
thought the colors'' of the graffiti ``were dynamic and lovely.''
   Westminster, a small liberal arts college in this central
Missouri community of about 11,000, has about 750 students.

   Angelo Natale, editorial supervisor at the World
Service and Foreign desks of The Associated Press and a former AP
foreign correspondent, has died at the age of 64.
   His AP career spanned almost five decades.
   Natale died at his home in Manhattan on Wednesday. He had
suffered from chronic diabetes and vascular problems.
   Natale joined the AP in 1942 and served in a variety of news
assignments that took him to Cairo and Moscow, as well as to
several AP bureaus in the eastern United States.
   His only time away from the AP was a 20-month stint with the
U.S. Army Air Force during World War II.
   In 1968, Natale joined the World Service division at AP
headquarters in New York. He was promoted to editorial supervisor
in 1973 at the desk responsible for transmitting AP news reports to
8,500 subscribers in 105 countries worldwide.
   ``Angelo was not only a supervisor but was a friend to everyone
in the department and to AP people around the world,'' said Tom
Kent, who is in charge of AP's Foreign and World Service desks.
   A native of the Bronx, Natale was educated in New York City
public schools and went to Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan. He
entered The City College of New York in September 1941 and then
went to work for the AP as an office assistant in March 1942.
   After military service, he returned to the AP in 1945 and worked
in various clerical positions while attending college at night.
   Natale was graduated from City College with a Bachelor of Social
Science degree in 1950 and then became a reporter at AP's Newark
bureau.
   He became correspondent in Atlantic City in 1956. In November
1956, he entered the AP's foreign service in Cairo, Egypt, at the
height of the Suez Canal crisis. He later covered stories
throughout the Middle East.
   In early 1958, Natale was transferred to the AP bureau in
Moscow, and in 1959 he returned to the United States and was
assigned to AP's New Haven, Conn., bureau. He transferred to the
World Service desk in 1968.
   Natale is survived by his mother, Rachel Natale, and his
brother, Salvatore Natale.
   Services are planned for Saturday at Gleason's Funeral Home in
Flushing, Queens. Burial will follow at Mt. St. Mary cemetery in
Flushing.

   Immigration agents reportedly acting
on a tip that terrorists with Iraqi connections had entered the
United States raided a church-operated shelter for Central American
immigrants Thursday.
   Immigration officials previously had maintained a hands-off
policy toward Casa Romero, operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese
of Brownsville, because it is considered a church. Thirty-five
people were arrested.
   Silvestre Reyes, chief patrol agent with the U.S. Border
Patrol's McAllen Sector, said immigration officials obtained the
search warrant after learning that there might be 21 Indians,
Pakistanis and Iranians there. He said officials particularly were
interested in finding individuals from the Sikh religious sect of
India.
   ``We have some information regarding national security regarding
those individuals,'' Reyes said.
   Five Indians, two Pakistanis, four Guyanese, two Salvadorans,
six Hondurans, a Guatemalan and 15 who said they were Mexican, were
arrested at Casa Romero for allegedly being in the country
illegally, Reyes said.
   Reyes said officials believe some of those identifying
themselves as Mexicans might be actually be from India.
   An immigration official who asked not to be identified said the
agents had obtained intelligence reports that terrorists were
trying to enter the United States to carry out actions on behalf of
Iraq. Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has threatened terrorist strikes
since the U.S. military buildup began in the Persian Gulf in
response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   About 25 U.S. Border Patrol agents with a search warrant entered
the six-acre compound while residents were in line for dinner.
   ``They're scared,'' Sister Norma Pimentel, shelter director,
said of the immigrants after the raid. ``They don't know why this
happened.''
   The shelter opened in 1982 in San Benito and moved to the
outskirts of Brownsville in 1987. The area around Brownsville,
Texas' southernmost city on the Mexican border, is a popular
crossing point for Central Americans, because it is the closest
U.S. point by land to that region.
   Reyes said although it was the first time the Border Patrol had
entered the shelter with a search warrant, he always had maintained
the right to enter.
   He said six Indians arrested at Kingsville in south Texas
earlier Thursday told agents that alien smugglers had made
arrangements for their trip at Casa Romero and had picked them up
there.
   The shelter is named for Monsignor Oscar Romero, who was gunned
down while saying Mass in El Salvadora on March 24, 1980.

   Jim Swire is a country doctor whose
days and evenings are devoted to his patients.
   His nights belong to his obsession: airport security and the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which killed his daughter, Flora.
   ``Why, Oh Why, Flora?''
   Swire wrote that on his briefcase, around a circular photograph
of his firstborn. In frequent meetings with government officials,
he makes sure they see it.
   ``You can see their hackles rising when they see a person
they've allowed to be killed. I don't see why they shouldn't see
it,'' said the soft-spoken, gray-haired physician.
   Flora Swire, a happy medical student, a gifted artist and
musician, was traveling to the United States to spend Christmas
with her American boyfriend. She was one of 270 people who died
when the plane blew up at 7:04 p.m. on Dec. 21, 1988, and rained
wreckage on the Scottish town of Lockerbie.
   It was the day before her 24th birthday.
   In the 21 months since then, her father has had periods of
intense depression and rage. But his campaign to point out security
flaws, bring the terrorists to justice and reform British airport
security has been relentless.
   On Monday, Swire will be in Dumfries, 10 miles west of
Lockerbie, for the opening of a public Scottish inquiry into
accident.
   ``Rage is my secret weapon. When I am sitting at this desk, it's
2 a.m. and I have another letter to write but I want to go to bed,
I just think about that flight, that warm airplane at four minutes
past 7, and it makes me so angry that the adrenalin starts going
and I can last for a few more hours,'' he said.
   The desk is Swire's communications center: a large computer, fax
machine and desk telephone to supplement a mobile phone tucked in
the breast pocket of his gray suit.
   There are many photographs of Flora - smiling with alert,
playful eyes - in the Swires' sandstone house overlooking the
Malvern Hills of central England.
   A son, William, is taking a year off before college. Catherine,
who saw her sister off at Heathrow Airport, still lives at home.
   ``She was excited about Flora's trip and even thought about
buying a ticket, too,'' Swire said. He took a deep breath, fighting
to keep the voice steady.
   ``I came within a hair's breadth of losing both of them.''
   The Swires keep a comfortable house, where the Burmese cat has
free rein over the oriental rugs, the dog's long tail slaps against
antiques and dinner in the kitchen is beef stew and home-grown
fruit.
   But talk around the table is about Mohammad Abu Talb, the
Palestinian terrorist serving a life sentence in Sweden for
bombings against American and Israeli targets in Europe. Lockerbie
investigators have identified Talb as a suspect.
   A telephone call from a Swedish journalist takes Swire from the
table.
   ``A (doctor's) family is used to being interrupted at the dinner
table but this is just unbelievable,'' said Jane Swire, her voice
trailing off, her eyes cast down.
   The inquiry beginning Monday, the Scottish version of an
inquest, is not the wide-ranging investigation that Swire has been
demanding. But he intends to spend as much of the opening week in
Dumfries as his practice allows. He hopes to testify.
   ``I am a thorn in the flesh of the British government. Thorns
fester and I am determined not to leave off until we have some
answers,'' he said.
   Swire wants to know why Department of Transport warnings about a
cassette recorder bomb like the one that blew up Flight 103 reached
airport security staff after his daughter was dead.
   Why was a warning of a terrorist threat given to U.S. Embassy
staff in Helsinki and other cities but not to the public?
   Why has the British government refused an independent inquiry,
even after a U.S. presidential commission reported in May that the
disaster could have been prevented?
   There were 259 passengers on the flight, including 31 British
citizens. As spokesman for U.K. Families Flight 103, Swire
frequently travels to the United States for meetings with the two
active family groups there.
   In May, he risked arrest by flying to New York with a fake bomb
in his suitcase to dramatize his belief that airport security is
still too lax.
   Swire, 54, learned about explosives during army service in the
Royal Engineers. He says it took him six hours to buy the parts and
duplicate the terrorist's bomb, substituting marzipan for Semtex,
the Czechoslovakian-made plastic explosive.
   ``When I smuggled the bomb on the flight to New York, and we
flew up over Scotland, and climbed to 31,000 feet, it was a strange
sensation that the other passengers didn't have a clue that there
was a fake bomb in the hold.''
   Swire's record for interviews is 24 in one day and his news
conferences are as well-run as any politician's.
   A scholarship in Flora's memory has been established at
Nottingham University. But the young woman may be most vividly
remembered in the dark circles under her father's eyes, a sign of
his determination.
   Swire said he has matured from initially wanting vengeance and
having people fired to a desire for improved airport security to
prevent another disaster. He admits the goal is distant.
   Swire said his initial rage was stoked by officials who treated
him as an ignorant outsider.
   ``It made me livid,'' he said. ``I had seen dead bodies lying in
pieces in a mausoleum in Lockerbie. The experts didn't know what
the death of 270 people looks like and they never would. That's why
they can forget it and have such a lackadaisical approach to
security.''
   The Swires traveled to Lockerbie a few days after the disaster.
   Families were told they could not see the bodies because it
would be too upsetting, a policy Swire says goes against
psychological practices.
   ``Being a doc, I pulled some strings and the pathologist put my
daughter's body aside for me,'' Swire said.
   There were flowers around her body in the makeshift mortuary,
and the pathologist had clipped a lock of Flora's thick, black hair
to give to the father.
   ``My mind was blank and I half expected to feel rage,'' Swire
said. ``But I just felt waves of sadness passing over me, wave
after wave, a flying carpet of sadness.''
   The Swires at first worked out their grief on their 16 acres of
pasture land, planting 4,500 trees.
   ``I was so sort of shellshocked,'' he said. ``I began planting
(the trees). It was a mindless job but it kept me busy, just
digging a hole, putting the tree in and tamping it down.''
   Cherry, oak, beech and mountain ash saplings now grow in Flora's
Wood. Some are planted to form a large ``F,'' a memorial visible
only from an airplane.

   Otto von Bismarck became a hero when he
unified Germany through blood and iron. As Germany merges
peacefully, he takes on renewed importance for a generation seeking
to draw lessons from the past.
   Tens of thousands of Germans, including political leaders, have
flocked to a major exhibit in West Berlin attempting to analyze
Bismarck and the consequences of his policies for Germany and for
Europe.
   The German Historical Museum's exhibit, ``Bismarck - Prussia,
Germany, and Europe'' was planned three years ago, when the
question of unity seemed a distant dream to most Germans.
   ``Nobody could have known three years ago how current the
Bismarck topic would be by the summer of 1990,'' says Christoph
Stoelzl, director of the German Historical Museum.
   The impact of German unity next Wednesday has preoccupied
today's politicians, diplomats, financiers and historians much as
it did when Bismarck united the country the first time in 1871.
   Some Europeans have expressed concern the new Germany will be
too big and too powerful, and more interested in itself than in
European unity. Again, there is a parallel to the Bismarck era,
because those same problems developed after 1871.
   ``It is important to think about what the concept of nationhood
means because of what is happening in Germany, but also in the
framework of European unity,'' said Bernard Falge, director of the
French Intitute in West Berlin. The institute has set up two
academic conferences on the topic.
   The Bismarck exhibit has already attracted leading politicians
since it opened Aug. 26. West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker, Social Democratic chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel and his
East German counterpart, Wolfgang Thierse, are among more than
50,000 people who have seen it. The exhibit runs until Nov. 25.
   It is hard to ignore Bismarck in Germany. Many towns have a
Bismarck street. There have been Bismarck submarines and ships.
There are hundreds of books devoted to the statesman known as the
``Iron Chancellor.''
   Nearly 300 institutions in more than a dozen countries lent
paintings, sculptures, letters, books, uniforms, maps and other
items to form the biggest collection of objects connected with
Bismarck ever assembled.
   ``It is rather overwhelming to go see so many things from that
time,'' said Manfred Jehle, a researcher at the Historical
Commission in West Berlin, after he saw the exhibit for the first
time.
   The first part of the exhibit concentrates on the powerful
region of Prussia, named for an exterminated pagan tribe. Bismarck,
a native Prussian, set German unity as one of his major goals when
he became prime minister of Prussia in 1862.
   But he looked down on a peaceful way to uniting Germany's
principalities, duchies, kingdoms, and states, which were
constantly being overrun by the French or the Austrians because of
their lack of unity.
   ``The great questions of the time will not be decided by
speeches and majority decisions, but through iron and blood,''
Bismarck said in one of his most famous speeches in 1862.
   The exhibit follows through Prussian battles in the 1860s to the
Franco-Prussian war and the 1871 proclamation of a constitutional
monarchy - and a unified Germany.
   This time, Germans are unifying after four decades of living
with the legacy of the country's Nazi past. And in contrast to
Bismarck, current Chancellor Helmut Kohl got what he wanted in
large part through skillful and patient diplomacy.
   This time, the united Germany will combine the 11 West German
states with five new states being reorganized in East Germany. Much
of Bismarck's Prussia now lies in the Soviet Union and Poland
following Nazi Germany's loss in World War II.
   The exhibit also focuses on Bismarck's policy toward Europe,
which was based on isolating France and building up an army
powerful enough to defeat the enemy. Several of Bismarck's spiked
helmets form part of an extensive display of German military dress.
   His strategy drove Europe apart and led to the glorification of
the military, which continued through the world wars that defeated
and then divided Germany.
   Kohl, however, espouses West Germany's postwar pro-European
policies and is committed to European unification. Kohl, the next
chancellor of a unified Germany, has promised to maintain that
policy rather than take Bismarck's militaristic path.

   Until the showers arrive,
the M-12 Decontamination Unit is the favorite spot at this Marine
camp in the northern Saudi desert.
   The unit is supposed to be used to wash troops free of chemical
weapons or any other dangerous substances they come in contact with
in the field.
   But for now, it's also doubling as the shower.
   Everyone follows the same routine: two minutes of water followed
by one minute to lather up followed by two minutes of water to
rinse.
   Or, as Capt. Adrian Burke of Deer Park, Texas, puts it:
   ``You wet down, wash up, rinse off and dry up and you're good to
go for another day.''
   You have to spend some time in the Saudi desert, where the
powdery sand clings to everything and everyone, to appreciate such
niceties.
   ``A four-minute shower might not seem like much, but out here
it's the highlight of the day,'' Burke said during a recent visit
to the camp, named after World War II Marine Ace Joe Foss.

   No matter where a soldier goes, there are constants - such as
military food.
   When there are no other meals available the troops get
modern-day C-rations, known today as Meals Ready to Eat. They're
3,000 calories, with the choice ranging from chicken a la king to
beef stew. uffice it to say they're not too tasty.
   ``Anyone who can eat an MRE ought to be able to take a hill,''
Marine Commandant Gen. Alfred Gray told a group of Marines during a
visit to their camp Wednesday.
   These men had just had a treat - a hot breakfast in the desert,
including what several men said was their first cup of hot coffee
since they arrived in Saudi Arabia five weeks ago.
   But the breakfast menu had a familiar, chow-hall ring: creamed
beef, ham and eggs, potatoes and pound cake.

   The Air Force is keeping its F-117 Stealth fighter-bomber away
from reporters, but not because they don't want to show it off.
   The Stealth was deployed to the region more than a month ago and
Air Force spokesmen soon after began taking names of reporters and
photographers who wanted to see the radar-eluding aircraft and
interview its pilots.
   But those plans are now on hold because of objections raised by
the Saudi government, according to miliary sources.
   The Stealth is considered an offensive weapon, and the American
deployment in Saudi Arabia is described as a defensive mission.
   ``The Saudis are worried it would send the wrong signals,'' one
of the military sources said.

   Prabhat Aggarwal knows by his very name
his place in life. ``Aggarwal'' is also his caste.
   ``Aggarwals were the masters of the economy in India. Kings and
rajas were dependent on us. We were the moneylenders,'' the
17-year-old student said.
   Aggarwal, whose caste puts him in the upper rank of Indian
society, was on a downtown street demonstrating against Prime
Minister V.P. Singh's policy to reserve more government jobs for
low-caste Indians.
   Singh described the policy as ``a glimmer of hope to those who
have known only oppression for centuries'' because of their caste.
He said Wednesday he would rather quit than ``barter away the
aspirations of the deprived.''
   Upper-caste students, angered and feeling threatened that jobs
historically dominated by their classes would be reserved for the
lower castes, have rioted across northern India, crippling New
Delhi for several days this week.
   On Sept. 19, a 20-year-old upper-caste student, Rajeev Goswami,
doused himself with gasoline and lit a match. Goswami survived, but
seven other students and a farmer have committed suicide, and
dozens have tried. Forty-six have died in clashes with police,
which prompted officials Thursday to declare curfews in eight
cities.
   ``We love Mother India,'' Aggarwal complained. ``But when a
mother says one child is good and the other is bad, what can we
do?''
   The upper-caste feel tremendous pressure from their families to
succeed, and the threat of losing jobs to people who are
less-qualified is driving them to desperate acts, said Ashis Nandi,
of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies.
   Critics say the timing and manner of announcing the policy made
it look like a political maneuver to undercut the support of one of
Singh's populist rivals.
   The policy is based on a much-criticized study by an obscure
politician of low caste, B.P. Mandal, which languished for 10 years
until Singh revived it in his election platform last year.
   The Mandal Commission classified 3,000 castes as ``socially and
educationally backward,'' and recommended that 27 percent of
government jobs be set aside for them. The government employs some
18 million people, though the military and defense jobs are
excluded from the quota system.
   Previously, 22 percent were reserved for the lowest sector of
society, native tribes and ``untouchables.'' The new policy left
slightly more than half the jobs available on merit alone.
   In a nation where millions of educated Indians lack work, the
new quota sent shivers through the college campuses.
   ``If I get 85 percent on my marks and he (a low-caste student)
gets 40 percent, he will get the job,'' Aggarwal said. ``I work
very hard. I know I must face competition. Now what's the point?''
   Nandi said only 1,700 jobs a year are affected by the government
plan.
   ``The students are overreacting,'' he said.``The upper castes
have a feeling of insecurity. They are few in number, and the lower
castes are in a great majority.''
   Singh argues his quotas will blur the distinctions of caste.
Critics say he has revived the notion of caste as an instrument of
state policy.
   The caste system, which began perhaps 2,500 years ago,
categorized Hindus into a social hierarchy determined by birth and
sanctioned by religion.
   Some 20,000sub-castes derive from the four primary castes: the
Brahmins who are priests, teachers and astrologers; Kshariyas who
comprise the royalty and warrior class; Vaisya who are merchants
and traders; and Sudras who do the menial tasks.
   Below them all are the untouchables. Tradition forbids them from
wearing shoes, riding bicycles, sharing a water well with caste
Hindus.
   Modern India, which is 82 percent Hindu, embraced secularism and
socialist ideals when it became independent from Britain in 1947,
and pledged to discard the caste system.
   Urbanization, economic mobility and the growth of a middle class
have dimmed the traditional power of caste, which once dictated who
one married, where one worked, and even how one carried himself.
   But its power is still considerable. Weekend classified pages
publish columns of matrimonial offers based on caste. Most
marriages still are arranged by parents.
   ``Caste is surviving, there's no doubt. But the role of caste is
changing,'' Nandi said. ``It's not much different than ethnic
groupings in the United States.''

   An 8,000-year-old village under the sea
has yielded an intriguing discovery: a water well thought to be the
oldest in the world.
   The archaeologist who found the well says it suggests ancient
man was smarter than previously thought.
   The 6-year-old dig beneath the Mediterranean seabed has already
turned up a trove of information about neolithic man. Findings
include the remains of stone houses, a fireplace preserved with its
charred wood, 23 buried skeletons, the bones of the animals the
villagers ate, the seeds they planted, the tools they made from
bone and stone.
   The latest excitement is over the discovery of several wells,
one of which was excavated and found to be 16 feet deep.
   Ehud Galili, the archaeologist heading the dig, said the village
is 7,700 to 8,000 years old, so that the well is some 1,000 years
older than the oldest well known until now.
   ``It is surprising because for the first time we have figured
out that prehistoric man was aware of the existence of water tables
under the ground and was able and had the proper technology to dig
these wells and to use this fresh water,'' he told reporters
visiting the site Thursday.
   ``As far as I know this is the oldest well discovered from that
period,'' he said.
   It raises fascinating questions: How did ancient man know that
if he dug deep enough, he would strike fresh water? And where did
he acquire the skill to sink a round shaft, paved with stone, in
much the same way as many modern wells are built?
   The well was full of prehistoric trash - bones, broken tools and
stones, Galili said. He speculated that at some point its water had
grown salty and it was turned into a garbage disposal pit.
   With the end of the Ice Age, the village disappeared beneath the
Mediterranean as melted ice raised the earth's sea levels. Sea sand
up to 12 feet thick preserved it.
   The village covers about 10 acres and lies beneath 39 feet of
water about 400 yards off the coast.
   It is in a small bay overlooked by a Crusader fort at Athlit, 10
miles south of the port city of Haifa. The dig is sponsored by the
government's Antiquities Authority.
   Like many underwater sites off Israel's coast, it came to light
because the creation of the Jewish state in 1948 led to a
construction boom. Huge amounts of beach sand were quarried,
depleting the protective layer over the undersea sites.
   For archaeologists, the underwater location is a cause for
crises. Every storm disrupts the ancient undersea world, and ``a
wall or a skeleton that has lain undisturbed for thousands of years
can be destroyed in a matter of weeks,'' Galili said.
   Among Galili's more striking finds is the skeleton of a woman
aged about 18, lying in a fetal position, her hand making a
clutching gesture.
   Nodules in the earholes of some skulls point to the inhabitants
having been divers, since such nodules result from a disease common
among people who spend too much time under water, he said.
   Galili said marks on the teeth in one skull suggest the man
worked with ropes, using his teeth to help knot them.
   While there is no indication the villagers had already
domesticated animals, the seeds found at the site imply that they
had learned to grow crops, Galili said.

Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
wielding less and less power and is in danger of becoming
irrelevant as restive Soviet republics wrest authority from the
central government, a senior administration official says.
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said Thursday that
Gorbachev's loss of power is a bigger threat to him than any coup
by the military. Rumors of a military takeover have surfaced in
Moscow in recent days, but the senior official discounted that
possibility.
   It is highly unusual that a government official - even when
guaranteed protection against being identified - would offer such a
candid and damaging assessment of a world leader of Gorbachev's
stature.
   Moreover, the portrayal of Gorbachev as a faltering figure
clashes with the picture that President Bush tried to project when
he flew thousands of miles to Helsinki this month to stand
alongside the Soviet president in a demonstration that the
superpowers are united against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   As a result, the official's comments raised questions about
whether the administration is reassessing its view of Gorbachev.
Asked if Gorbachev's problems could complicate the way the United
States deals with Moscow, the official replied: ``I think it could.
It hasn't happened yet.''
   Publicly, Bush has acknowledged that Gorbachev has serious
problems, particularly with his crisis-ridden economy. Yet, he has
been unreserved in his praise of the Soviet leader and has said it
is in the best interest of the United States for him to remain in
power.
   The official made his comments in response to questions during
an interview with news service reporters.
   In a separate interview, Brookings Institution scholar Helmut
Sonnenfeldt said, ``The administration is quite conscious of this
decay of authority and power'' of Gorbachev and his government.
   ``I think that there is a crisis of authority that's been
accumulating for some time,'' said Sonnenfeldt, a specialist in
East-West relations who served in the Nixon and Ford
administrations.
   ``The central government and the president (Gorbachev) himself
are seriously lacking in authority,'' Sonnenfeldt said. ``He
(Gorbachev) has this power that he has been getting from the
Supreme Soviet, but is it not clear that anybody pays any attention
and implements'' his orders.
   Rumors have swept Moscow in recent days of a military takeover
amid curious troop movements in and around the city. The rumors
reached the point where Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov felt
compelled Wednesday to pledge the military's allegiance to the
power structure and assert that the troop movements were routine.
   The senior administration official said Soviet history offers no
precedent for such an attempt by the military.
   ``I think one of Gorbachev's big problems is not his own staying
power,'' the official said. ``He's shown himself a pretty good
master of that. But he's commanding less and less, and I think his
real danger is becoming irrelevant.
   ``In other words,'' the official continued, ``power just kind of
gravitates away from the union government to the constituent - to
the republic governments.''
   The official said the Kremlin still prevails on matters of
foreign policy and the military.
   ``But I think that's his danger now, that he's being denuded of
power,'' the official asserted.
   The official said it would be a setback if Gorbachev were unable
to make agreements that are binding on the system. ``But we're not
there yet.''
   The official said most of the subjects being negotiated between
Washington and Moscow are foreign policy and arms control matters
that ``would be the last to be affected by the internal competition
between the central government and the republics.''
   Many of the Soviet Union's republics have declared independence,
and nationalist groups have been agitating for a break with Moscow.
   Boris Yeltsin, elected recently as president of the Russian
republic, the largest of the 15, has criticized Gorbachev for the
slow pace of economic reforms. Yeltsin has demanded aditional
powers for the republics.
   On Monday, the Soviet legislature granted Gorbachev sweeping new
powers to take measures to stabilize the economy and to maintain
law and order.

<HEAD>Superpowers Move to Accord to Limit Conventional Arms in Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union are close
to agreement on a new treaty to cut their conventional arms in
Europe.
   Two of the three remaining disputes were basically resolved
Thursday at a meeting of Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   That left a disagreement over limiting aircraft to be ironed out
in time for a 34-nation summit in Paris in mid-November.
   The steady withdrawal of Soviet troops and tanks from Eastern
and Central Europe, along with sizable reductions in U.S. forces
among the NATO countries, are already accomplishing what the treaty
negotiators set out to do.
   However, the accord would make reductions of weapons - troops
are being omitted - legally binding. And it would be a symbolic
milestone in the easing of East-West tensions.
   Baker and Shevardnadze plan to meet again soon in New York to
chip away at the aircraft issue and to make sure the tentative
agreements on the two other issues stick.
   One would establish zones in which Noth Atlantic Treaty
Organization and Warsaw Pact arms would be limited. The other would
impose a ceiling on the percentage of either bloc's weapons that
any one nation could retain.
   Baker said after seeing Shevardnadze that they had made ``some
good progress'' toward the treaty, the projected centerpiece of the
34-nation summit. Shevardnadze said they had made ``real headway.''
   The treaty, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, has been in
negotiation in Vienna since February 1989. An earlier, 15-year
attempt to reduce tensions through cutbacks in troops and weapons
failed.
   But when Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev set out to end
the Cold War the outlook brightened.
   Still, nagging disputes stood in the way. U.S. and Soviet
negotiators, racing the clock, have been meeting daily since last
week - first in Washington and since then in New York.
   Although the treaty is not complete, Baker and Shevardnadze
agreed to submit the tentative understandings on two of the three
most troublesome issues to their allies.
   Immediately after the session, Baker briefed NATO foreign
ministers, in New York for the special session of the United
Nations General Assembly, on the results.
   A senior State Department official told reporters, meanwhile,
there was ``basic agreement'' with the Soviets on establishing
zones in which numerical limits would be placed on non-nuclear
weapons.
   Also, Baker and Shevardnadze tentatively agreed on how high a
percentage of permissible weapons any one nation could have in its
arsenal, said the official, who demanded anonymity.
   The third major issue remains unresolved, although Baker
volunteered that progress had been made on it.
   It concerns whether all European land-based aircraft of the two
alliances should be included in the treaty, as the United States
has proposed, or whether planes the Soviets say have defensive
missions should be exempt.
   ``We have removed most of the gaps,'' the State Department
source said separately.
   Much of the spadework was done by U.S. and Soviet negotiators
before Baker and Shevardnadze met.
   They are trying to have all key issues settled so the
painstaking process of preparing a text can begin and be completed
by the time of the projected summit.
   A senior French official, briefing American reporters, said he
was confident the treaty would be ready for signing at the Paris
meeting.
   One of Thursday's breakthroughs concerned what technicians call
the sufficiency rule.
   It concerns whether any single member of NATO or the Warsaw Pact
should be allowed to hold more than 30 percent of permitted
weapons, as the Bush administration proposes; or be allowed up to
40 percent, as Moscow favors.
   Evidently, Baker and Shevardnadze struck a compromise on that
question. Asked if they had agreed on 30 percent or 40 percent,
Baker said: ``It's neither one of these.''
   ``We had a very productive discussion,'' Shevardnadze said. ``I
would like to note quite substantial progress and a better
understanding. ... We have made real headway.''
   Earlier, Baker said the two sides still anticipate having a
conventional forces treaty ``essentially agreed to in November, or
we will be unable to have'' a summit.
   Still unresolved are verification procedures for determining
whether provisions of the treaty are being observed.
   Also unsettled is a separate proposed U.S.-Soviet treaty to
reduce long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by about
30 percent. Bush hopes to sign that accord in Moscow in December.
   Bush is expected to see Shevardnadze when the president comes to
New York this weekend to address the special General Assembly
session Monday.

<TEXT>
   By 1944, Army careerist Dwight David
Eisenhower had five stars, an Allied Forces command, but no
hometown.
   For years, the man who later became the nation's 34th president
had incorrectly given Tyler, Texas, as his birthplace.
   Enter Jennie Jackson, a retired schoolteacher, principal and
amateur historian in Denison, a small town 70 miles north of
Dallas.
   She remembered rocking an Eisenhower infant on her knee in 1890,
and wondered if it was the general.
   She secretly wrote Eisenhower, who told her to contact his
mother, Ida. She wrote back confirming the general was indeed the
same ``David Eisenhower'' Miss Jackson remembered.
   She then went public with a campaign to save the small clapboard
house where Eisenhower was born.
   Miss Jackson died shortly after she persuaded the city to buy
the house in 1946, but not before a reunion with the future
president that year when he visited Denison. Eisenhower was elected
president in 1952.
   ``The main thing was he was born in Denison and that means a lot
to have a president born here,'' said Vivian Hassel, 82, a former
tour guide at the birthplace, now a state historic landmark.
   A failed grocery business in Kansas and a new job with the Katy
Railroad brought the Eisenhower family to Denison in 1888, Mrs.
Hassel said.
   About eight months after Eisenhower, the third of seven sons,
was born Oct. 14, 1890, the family moved to Abilene, Kansas.
   Originally named David Dwight Eisenhower, he reversed the names
by high school.
   On Saturday and Sunday, Denison residents will celebrate the
100th birthday of the native son they almost never had, with a
parade, 10-kilometer run, birthday party, ball and even a President
and Mrs. Eisenhower look-alike contest.
   Attending the ceremonies will be Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and
Eisenhower's nephew Earl Eisenhower Jr.
   A special coin commemorating the 100th birthday will be unveiled
by the U.S. Department of Treasury.
   City officials are holding the anniversary early to prevent an
overlap with the Abilene celebration next month.
   Although the Kansas city is also closely associated with
Eisenhower, his Denison connection is no secret.
   Last year, more than 75,000 tourists visited the modest
two-story home, and Mayor Ben Munson said there are plans to double
the size of the two-acre park where it is located.
   A 15-minute tour of the house includes the humorous tale of the
tumbling block quilt, the only original Eisenhower family
possession inside the birthplace.
   Sewn by Eisenhower's mother and her sons, including the former
president, it was donated by a family member years ago, spurring a
controversy among the Eisenhower relatives.
   For years the family fought over the ownership of the quilt,
said Ajkeem Elahi, the park's manager. This year, a family member
visited the house and laughed when she saw it.
   ``She said they're still fighting over that,'' he said.
   Other items in the house include Miss Jackson's black spindle
rocker. And there is an oil portrait of an American Indian, painted
by Eisenhower after he became president.
   ``Winston Churchill got him started on painting,'' Elahi said.

<HEAD>Saddam Moving to Transform Kuwait Into an Iraqi Province</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein is moving to transform Kuwait
into an Iraqi province by altering the country's demography,
erasing its national identity and removing its infrastructure, U.S.
analysts say.
   ``What we are seeing is the de-Kuwaitization of Kuwait. This is
the history of the Iraqi regime,'' one U.S. official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The Iraqi president has been changing Kuwait since the Aug. 2
invasion - even renaming streets and institutions to eliminate
signs of the ousted government, officials said. Every passing day
takes the country further away from what it once was.
   At the same time, the Kuwaiti resistance inside the occupied
country is faltering.
   ``The resistance is past its apex,'' an official said. ``They
put up a brave effort, but they can't sustain it''
   There were reports after the invasion of car bombings and
killings of Iraqi soldiers. But the Iraqis retaliated brutally,
making house-to-house searches to find resistance leaders, Kuwaiti
exiles said.
   Saddam's pattern in Kuwait is similar to the way he rid Iraq of
internal dissidents, analysts said. ``It's a fairly basic notion of
depopulation,'' said another official, who also spoke on condition
on anonymity.
   ``So far, what you see is a logical unfolding of (Saddam's) plan
to secure Kuwait as the 19th province of Iraq. He is changing the
Kuwaiti demography,'' said Richard W. Murphy, a former assistant
secretary of state for the Middle East and a scholar at the Council
of Foreign Relations.
   The man Saddam put in charge of Kuwait has a bloody past,
officials said.
   Known as the ``butcher of Kurdistan,'' Iraq's minister of local
government, Ali Hasan Al-Majid, ordered poison gas used against
Kurdish dissidents in 1988, U.S. officials said.
   He was involved in the forced resettlement of 500,000 Kurds who
were moved from the mountains to unfamiliar desert villages.
Moreover, he was responsible for rounding up 60,000 Shia Moslems in
1980 and forcibly trucking them to Iran. The Shias were suspected
of planting bombs in Iraq.
   The most recent attempt to make over Kuwait came Thursday when
Iraq gave Kuwaitis until Oct. 31 to adopt Iraqi citizenship. The
Iraqi Interior Ministry did not say what would happen to Kuwaitis
who did not change their citizenship.
   Saddam might be planning to seek U.N.-sponsored elections once
he has given Kuwait a new complexion, officials said.
   That scenario could create fissures in the worldwide alliance
against Iraq partly because the al-Sabah royal family of Kuwait is
not resoundingly popular with other Arab leaders, according to
Hermann Eilts, director of Boston University's Center for
International Relations.
   Kuwait had a population of about 2.5 million when Iraq invaded,
officials said. But only 550,000 people were native Kuwaitis, and
about 450,000 of them were in the country at the time of the
invasion. Since then, the native Kuwaiti population has dwindled to
about 250,000, officials said.
   When Kuwaitis have been allowed to flee the country - as when
Iraq opened up the border to Saudi Arabia 10 days ago - the Iraqis
have seized their identity cards and other papers before letting
them go. Iraq also has detained young Kuwaiti men.
   Large numbers of foreigners also live in Kuwait, including an
estimated 300,000 Palestinians, the largest foreign community still
in Kuwait. There also are about 120,000 Indians, many of whom are
trying to leave. Scores of thousands of Asians already have fled.
   Saddam has placed close to 200,000 troops in Kuwait, with at
least that many more across the border in Iraq. Although Saddam has
yet to move Iraqi citizens into Kuwait to take over jobs, he may do
so in the future, officials said.
   Saddam's soldiers also have been aggressive in looting Kuwait,
stealing everything from hospital equipment to traffic lights.
   Many goods - food, fruit and video recorders - have shown up in
the markets of Baghdad where international trade sanctions have
taken a toll on the number of goods available, officials said.
   ``Saddam may be telling his people, in effect, that here is a
payback,'' one official said.

<HEAD>Easy Senate Confirmation Seen for Supreme Court Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supreme Court nominee David Souter can expect
an easy confirmation vote in the Senate next week following a
lopsided endorsement by the Judiciary Committee.
   But the breadth of voting support enjoyed by the New Hampshire
jurist belies widespread doubt lawmakers are expressing about what
kind of justice he'll make.
   ``I will vote for Judge Souter's confirmation. I do not do so
enthusiastically,'' Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden said
before his panel voted 13-1 in favor of Souter on Thursday. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., was the dissenter.
   If President Bush takes the ease of Souter's approval as a sign
it can easily win an even more conservative choice in the future,
he would be wrong, said Biden, D-Del.
   ``Judge Souter falls within the sphere of candidates acceptable
to this committee,'' he said. ``Other nominees ... could well fall
outside of that sphere.''
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, announced Thursday
night that he and Republican leaders had agreed to hold the Senate
confirmation vote Tuesday.
   Bush hailed the committee action and renewed his request for a
Senate vote before the Supreme Court begins its new term Monday.
But the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur this weekend and Senate rules
led Mitchell to rule that out.
   Souter, who would replace retired Justice William Brennan, a
liberal, did not attend the committee meeting but issued a
statement from New Hampshire thanking the senators ``for their
courtesy and consideration.''
   ``I am gratified by their action. I await the decision of the
full Senate,'' he said.
   The key to Souter's acceptability to the committee was his
insistence during the hearings that he was open-minded on whether
the court should reverse its 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that
legalized abortion.
   ``Is it likely that President George Bush will nominate anyone
who is strong in civil liberties and civil rights?'' said Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill. ``We probably have as moderate a choice as George
Bush will send to the Senate.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said he was willing to give
Souter the benefit of the doubt, of which he saw much.
   ``The bottom line is that we just don't know how he will vote on
such issues as privacy and discrimination,'' Metzenbaum said. ``My
sense is that David Souter is a fair and open-minded jurist who
knows well the weight of the responsibilities which will be placed
upon him.''
   ``I hope I'm not wrong,'' Metzenbaum said.
   ``I hope I am wrong,'' said Kennedy, one of only a handful of
senators to oppose Souter so far.
   ``I am troubled that if Judge Souter joins the current closely
divided Supreme Court, he will solidify a 5-4 anti-civil rights,
anti-privacy majority inclined to turn back the clock on the
historic progress of recent decades,'' Kennedy said.
   Conservative Republicans also had doubts about the nominee but
felt obliged to support the president. ``Aspects of Judge Souter's
testimony were of little comfort to legal conservatives, including
this senator,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire, who
still voted for him in committee.
   Norma McCorvey, the plaintiff in the Roe vs. Wade case, said at
a news conference in Los Angeles, ``It is appalling that women may
lose their reproductive rights. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee
should not have voted to confirm Judge Souter because he refused to
answer the ultimate question of how he feels about abortion.''

   ``Fear matters,'' says Georgia State
University economic forecaster Donald Ratajczak, so it doesn't
surprise him if the Bush administration is dancing away from using
the word ``recession'' to describe the state of the economy.
   It doesn't surprise Alfred Kahn, either. A retired Cornell
University professor, Kahn was chairman of President Carter's
Council on Wage and Price Stability. He recalls what happened in
1978 when he suggested that unless inflation were brought under
control pronto the nation might face a deep depression.
   Stuart Eizenstat, a presidential aide, called up and asked him
if he might just quit using that word.
   So next time out, Kahn used ``banana'' when he meant
``depression.'' He talked about The Great Banana of 1929. He said
if inflation weren't brought under control, the nation might have a
big banana.
   Kahn learned a political lesson. Fear matters and words alone
can trigger fear.
   Recession is a loaded word, and economists who can't agree on
whether the country is in one yet concur that the word itself can
spur one on.
   ``Fear matters,'' said Georgia State's Ratajczak. ``But
obviously what's in the pocketbook matters, too. If the pocketbook
is still jingling, fear can soon be overcome.''
   ``People start looking at their budgets and seeing what they can
live without. They tend to make business slow down when they do
that,'' said Bob Dieli, an economist for the Northern Trust Co. of
Chicago.
   Small wonder that when the bad news came out Tuesday, six weeks
before an election, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said,
``We don't believe we are in a recession right now.'' He was
commenting on the Commerce Department's report that the economy
grew at a stagnant annual rate of 0.45 percent in the second
quarter of this year.
   And small wonder, at least to linguist Walker Gibson, that Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, says
he'd like to redefine recession. Gibson is founder of the Committee
on Public Doublespeak of the National Council of Teachers of
English.
   The usual definition is that a recession occurs after six months
of decline in the gross national product, the total value of new
goods and services in the nation. Greenspan told Congress last week
he'd prefer a less rigid definition. A true recession, he said, is
a ``cumulative unwinding of economic activity.''
   Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said he can't blame the White House for refusing to label the
economy's current state a recession.
   ``If I were the president, I wouldn't say we were in a
recession, either,'' Rahn said. ``They are not in a position to
give judgment calls the way we and other outsiders are. They are
the guardian of the statistics. They need to be very, very
cautious.''
   The fear that the word recession triggers, said Gibson, tells
something about language itself. The word ``recession,'' he said,
``almost certainly started as a euphemism for an even more fearsome
word, depression.
   ``But it's been used so long as a euphemism that it's lost its
power to euphemize,'' he said. ``Now they talk about `downturns.'''

<TEXT>
   White House and congressional negotiators
narrowed differences Thursday over their budget problems with
reported agreements on energy and luxury taxes and cuts in benefit
programs. But key disputes remained to block a deal that would
avoid bone-deep cuts in federal programs on Monday.
   The two sides, racing the calendar, swapped offers into the
early hours Friday, trying to put together the final pieces of a
$500 billion, five-year deficit-cutting package.
   Parts of the pact tentatively agreed to were an additional
8-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax; a small tax on the energy content
of all fuels and 10 percent taxes on luxury items ranging from
fancy cars to electronic equipment, said one official who asked to
not be identified.
   About $60 billion in savings over the five years would come from
cuts in Medicare. Half would hit the elderly, including about a
$5.70 increase in the $28.60 monthly premium they pay for the
program's hospitalization coverage.
   Another $14 billion in cuts would be made in federal workers'
employment and retirement benefits, and $12 billion more would come
from reductions in support payments for farmers.
   The federal gasoline tax is now 9 cents per gallon. States add
additional taxes on top of that.
   The energy tax would be three-quarters of a cent per million
BTU, a measure of eergy. It takes about eight or nine gallons of
gasoline to yield a million BTU, so the extra tax would amount to
about 0.08 cents per gallon, hardly enough to register at the pump.
   Applied to high-quality coal burned by an electric utility, the
tax would raise the cost of a 500-kilowatt-hour monthly electric
bill for a small home by about 4 cents.
   If successful before Monday, the bargainers would allow the
government to sidestep $85 billion in spending cuts that the law
would otherwise require. The slashes would result in furloughs for
many of the 2.1 million federal civilian workers, including FBI
agents and air traffic controllers.
   Republicans were willing to accept a toned-down version of the
cut in capital gains tax rates that President Bush has sought since
he was a presidential candidate in 1988. The battle between
Democrats and the administration over the tax has been the key
barrier to a budget deal.
   Capital gains - the profits from the sale of assets such as
corporate stock or houses - are now taxed like ordinary income.
   But Democrats seemed uncertain about whether in return they
would demand higher income tax rates on the wealthy or a limit on
the tax deductions the well-to-do could take, said officials who
asked to not be identified.
   ``I don't mean to put it in a negative way, but there is still a
possibility of failure,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash. ``The odds are we will succeed.''
   Bush had argued that cutting capital gains tax rates would boost
the economy. Democrats say the tax cut would benefit the rich and
want higher taxes on the wealthy in return.
   But the president was now willing to leave the rates constant if
the increased value of an asset due to inflation is exempted,
officials close to the talks have said. The proposal would apply
only to property purchased after the plan became law.
   This official, like all the others who discussed the various
proposals Tuesday night, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Still undecided, however, was which tax boost the two sides
would agree to as a trade-off.
   Republicans have proposed limiting income tax deductions for the
wealthy, said one official who asked to not be identified. In one
variation of the idea, people earning more than $200,000 annually
would only be able to claim 95 percent of the deductions to which
they would otherwise be entitled.
   Democrats are interested in that idea, but have also advanced
two other proposals, said another official who demanded anonymity.
   They remain interested in raising the top-bracket income tax
rate on the wealthiest Americans from the current 28 percent.
People who are somewhat less well-off pay 33 percent in their top
bracket.
   Democrats would like to boost the top rate on the rich, but they
are willing to settle for a new level below 33 percent.
   They have also proposed lifting the earnings ceiling above which
Medicare taxes are not taken out of paychecks.
   As part of Social Security withholding, people now pay a 1.45
percent tax to support Medicare on earnings up to $51,300 per year.
They pay nothing on money they earn above that amount. Under the
proposal, that ceiling would be lifted to $65,000 or $75,000.
   The bargainers remained close to agreeing on cuts in defense and
domestic programs.
   The two sides appeared close to agreeing to reduce the military
budget by $170 billion over the next five years from the amount it
would need to stay abreast with inflation.
   They were also trying to find a way to reduce spending on
benefit programs by $120 billion over the five years.
   One GOP suggestion for finding additional savings in benefit
programs was to delay next year's cost-of-living increase for the
39 million Social Security recipients for three months.
   Another official said Republicans had offered to delay
cost-of-living increases for 60 days for all federal benefits,
including Social Security, veterans' benefits, and federal
retirement programs.
   Democrats prefer increasing the tax on Social Security benefits.
Recipients who earn $25,000 annually - $32,000 for couples - now
must pay taxes on half their Social Security benefits. The
Democratic proposal would boost that proportion to 85 percent.
   Earlier in the day, Bush continued to assail Democrats as the
culprits in the months-long budget standoff, which has brought the
government to the brink of the new fiscal year without any spending
legislation in place.
   ``There may be senior citizens wondering why their Social
Security checks are late,'' Bush said Thursday at a GOP breakfast
in Minneapolis, citing a federal program that would be damaged by
Monday's automatic cuts. ``We can't afford business as usual. The
American people deserve better.''
   Increasingly restive rank-and-file lawmakers, Democrat and
Republican, complained that the compromise package in the works
went too far to satisfy the opposite party. The disgruntlement
signaled potential problems for whatever Congress is finally asked
to vote on.

   Shots were fired Friday at the
Mindanao home of a member of President Corazon Aquino's Cabinet.
One person was killed and another wounded.
   It was not immediately known who fired the shots at the home of
Luis Santos, secretary of local governments, but Santos' guards
were under investigation.
   Santos' home is in Davao City, 610 mles southeast of Manila, on
Mindanao island.
   In a report from Davao, radio station DZXL said Santos had
leaned over to kiss a grandchild when a bullet whizzed passed him
and struck a member of his household.
   Santos told The Associated Press by telephone that a 67-year old
family friend, Marcosa Reyes, was fatally wounded in the neck, and
his 17-year old maid, Arlene Caballero, was hit in the left
shoulder.
   He then hung up the telephone without giving further details.
   ``Suddenly there was shooting,'' said another maid, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``I don't know where it came from. No one
came in or out.''
   Police chief investigator Lt. Col. Efren Arayata said Santos'
guards were being questioned and would undergo paraffin test to see
if one of them fired the shots. The test determines if a person
fired a weapon based on presence of powder on the hands.
   Santos arrived in Davao on Thursday at the invitation of local
business leaders who were concerned about rumors of an impending
military coup attempt.
   During a meeting, Santos assured the businessmen that the
government was stable and could cope with any emergency. Local
fears intensified with the arrival of a marine battalion
reinforcing troops chasing a renegade colonel who defected from
Mrs. Aquino's guard force and joined last December's attempt to
oust her.
   Santos was a former police chief of Davao. He assumed the
Cabinet post following the Aug. 20, 1987, assassination of Local
Governments Secretary Jaime Ferrer.
   Two people were convicted of killing Ferrer, but the court never
established who ordered his murder.

   Actress Sharon Gless says she was worn out
after six years of tracking bad guys on television's ``Cagney &amp;
Lacey.''
   ``I just retreated. I worked on getting my act together, finding
me again,'' she said. ``It sounds so corny. But I had to find out
what I liked to do besides work.''
   Miss Gless, who portrayed New York detective Chris Cagney on the
CBS show, is feeling better now and has a new TV series, ``The
Trials of Rosie O'Neill.''
   The blond-haired, blue-eyed actress stars as an attorney who
left a prestigious law firm for a job as a public defender after
her husband dumped her for a younger woman.
   Miss Gless, 47, says Rosie isn't a hero but nn ordinary woman
trying to find a meaningful life after spending her 43 years
pleasing others.

   Hank Aaron says Oakland A's outfielder Jose
Canseco is the best bet for breaking his major league baseball home
run record. If he keeps playing, that is.
   ``That's the problem. Baseball players today can afford to
quit,'' Aaron said Thursday. ``I had to keep playing. I needed the
money.''
   Aaron slammed 755 home runs in 23 seasons and retired after the
1976 season. He played all but two of his seasons with the
Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves.
   Aaron, 56, in Lincoln to go to bat at fund-raisers for the Big
Brothers and Big Sisters programs, said too much focus in baseball
today is on money.
   ``You can't put a dollar value on the home runs, the runs batted
in in your career,'' he said. ``Besides, a fool and his money
always part.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actor Corey Feldman must stick to drug
rehabilitation this time to avoid another arrest, a judge warned
the teen-ager.
   Judge Gordon Ringer issued a warrant Thursday for Feldman's
arrest but said he wouldn't have it enforced if Feldman completed a
residential rehabilitation program.
   ``He realizes he has a real addiction problem. He has tried to
deal with it through other means and has obviously been
unsuccessful,'' said Feldman's lawyer, Richard Hirsch. ``He is
committed to putting his career on hold and saving his life.''
   Feldman, 19, who entered the program this week, was arrested
twice on heroin-related charges. He began an outpatient abuse
program shortly after his first arrest on March 9 and declared his
independence from drugs. Then came his second arrest Sept. 21, when
police said they found two balloons of heroin in his sock.
   Feldman appeared in the movies ``Goonies,'' ``Gremlins'' and
``Stand By Me.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Julian Lennon wanted a little scenery - at
most any cost.
   The son of the slain John Lennon recently bought his third home
in less than three years. He paid nearly $1.3 million for his new
Beverly Hills digs.
   ``He moved this time because he missed having a view. He didn't
have a view at his last house, but he has one of Los Angeles at
this one,'' said Erin Caldwell of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young realtors.
   The 3,000-square-foot home is on a private drive and has three
bedrooms, two bathrooms and a guest apartment.
   ``He likes its views, trees, big lawn and pool. He likes the
country feel to it, with its pitched beam ceilings. And he likes
its privacy,'' Caldwell said.

   The Metropolitan Opera's fourth opera in four
nights of its new season was a resoundingly sung ``Don Giovanni,''
without a famous cast, and with two notable debuts.
   Met Artistic Director James Levine conducted the Mozart
masterpiece.
   The young American baritone Thomas Hampson, from Spokane, has
the figure and voice for Don Giovanni. Bass Paul Plishka, from Old
Forge, Pa., was a nice contrast, deeper and more mature sounding,
as his servant Leporello.
   Hampson might stress the swashbuckling a bit more; he seemed
more at ease when Don Giovanni was trying to woo subtly than when
he was being his most rakish. Plishka's comic timing and stage
presence were always on target.
   Hans Peter Blochwitz, a tenor from Garmisch, Germany, made his
Met debut as Don Ottavio. He's so good that if the baritone had
been bad, we'd still have loved the evening.
   Blochwitz has sung Ottavio with the Vienna State Opera, in
Hamburg and Amsterdam. He has the perfect voice for Mozart, Handel
and Bach, which he has been singing. One hopes that he has no
interest in heavier music that would harm his voice and that he
will return often to the Met.
   Patricia Schuman, a native of Los Angeles, made the other debut,
as Donna Elvira. She switched from mezzo-soprano to soprano in
1985, has sung both the title roles in ``Carmen'' and ``Madama
Butterfly'' in San Francisco. In December, she'll sing opening
night of the La Scala season in Mozart's ``Idomeneo.''
   Her voice is lovely and has enough vibrato for texture, making a
contrast to the evening's other two sopranos.
   Cheryl Studer of Detroit began the evening as the virginal Donna
Anna with a small voice. After Don Giovanni kills her father, she
is determined on revenge and sings with much more strength. She hit
and held high notes beautifully, then sometimes grated when
releasing notes. But her final aria, which includes coloratura
singing, was splendid and received much applause.
   The other soprano, Marie McLaughlin of Motherwell, Britain, as
Zerlina was excellent, too. Her bridegroom-to-be, Masetto, who can
often be ignored, was sung by Julien Robbins, who made a solid role
of it. Robbins, from Harrisburg, Pa., also sang on opening night.
   The current production, by Franco Zeffirelli, was new last
March.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Reaching Time to Decide on Probe of Senators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Ethics Committee is at a turning
point in its investigation of five senators who tried to help
former savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr. when his
institution was heading toward collapse.
   Committee members have been meeting over the last two weeks to
decide whether the cases of some or all the senators should be
either dismissed or expanded.
   Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Irvine,
Calif., was taken over by the government in April 1989, and it
could cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to cover the thrift's
losses.
   Keating and his associates contributed some $1.3 million to the
campaigns and causes of the five senators: Republican John McCain
of Arizona and Democrats Alan Cranston of California, Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr.
of Michigan.
   All have said their intervention was routine assistance for
someone who complained of unfair treatment by regulators.
   The committee meetings could end a preliminary inquiry. Any
cases kept alive could bring those senators long ethics hearings
structured like a trial.
   The preliminary phase was announced by the six-member committee
last Dec. 22, and a few senators have grumbled that ethics
investigations take too long.
   In response, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a member of the committee
of three Democrats and three Republicans, said the senators on the
panel ``wish it could be expedited.''
   Asked if the long investigation was unfair to the senators known
as the ``Keating Five,'' Helms replied: ``How do you define
unfairness? Do you suggest we don't work every angle? We just have
a heavy load.''
   The case is proving difficult because no specific Senate rule
provides guidelines on what constitutes undue influence by a member
of Congress who intervenes with regulators. In this case, all five
senators met with regulators on Keating's behalf.
   The Ethics Committee must determine if the senators' actions in
the Keating case violated a resolution prohibiting ``improper
conduct which may reflect upon the Senate.''
   The senators intervened with U.S. banking regulators in April
1987 on behalf of Keating.
   Edwin J. Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, said the four senators with whom he met in the first of two
meetings backed a deal to aid Keating's future operations. The
senators - all except Riegle, who did not attend - vigorously
denied that any deal was proposed.
   At a second meeting with the regulators in charge of the Lincoln
examination, all five senators were told that matters in the case
would be referred to the Justice Department for a criminal
investigation.
   Keating this month was indicted in California on state criminal
fraud charges.
   Congressional sources said that lacking a specific rule on
senators' conduct with executive branch officials, the ethics panel
could seek guidance from the recent cases of former House Speaker
Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn.
   Wright resigned from Congress more than a year ago after the
House ethics committee filed formal charges against him.
Durenberger was denounced by the Senate in July for violating
Senate rules on receipt of gifts, speaking fee limits, financial
disclosure and campaign contributions.
   In Durenberger's case, one key issue was not covered by a
specific rule.
   The Ethics Committee found that Durenberger acted deceptively to
hide his ownership in a Minneapolis condominium from the Senate, so
he could receive rent reimbursements to which he was not entitled.
   The committee said the senator abused his office and misused
funds ``through a pattern of improper conduct that has brought
discredit upon the United States Senate.''
   Wright, like the senators in the Keating inquiry, had intervened
with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. In the speaker's case, he
did so on behalf of Texans who complained of unfair treatment.
   While the House ethics committee eventually found little
evidence of undue influence by Wright, the special counsel in the
case wrote of the principles governing proper and improper
intervention.
   The counsel, Richard Phelan, said a House advisory opinion
considered it proper for a member to request information or a
status report from regulators; to urge prompt consideration of a
matter; arrange for interviews or appointments; express judgments
and call for reconsideration of a decision.
   But Phelan said a member should treat all constituents equally,
and there should be no direct or implied suggestion of favoritism
or reprisal involving the agency.

   Aircraft refuelers voted to return

three days and stranded thousands of passengers.
   The two major domestic airlines, Ansett and Australian, canceled
200 flights Thursday and also had cut back today's schedule. The
strike hit during the school holidays and had threatened to extend
to the three-day Labor Day holiday starting Saturday in some areas.
   The walkout affected an estimated 20,000 travelers and led to
bus and train services being completely booked.
   The strike began in Perth over reports of plans to reduce
refueling crews from two people to one.
   Workers Union assistant national secretary Ken McGrath told a
news conference that the workers accepted offers of talks with oil
companies.

<HEAD>Arts Endowment Denies Claim it Backed `Oral Sex' Puppet Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts is
vigorously denying evangelist Pat Robertson's claim that it
subsidized an Atlanta arts festival last week where a ``children's
puppet show'' allegedly featured simulated oral sex.
   ``This is just the latest example of the continual distortion of
fact by the arts endowment's most virulent critics, those intent on
eliminating the agency at any cost, even that of the truth,'' said
NEA spokesman Jack Lichtenstein.
   Robertson said Thursday that his Christian Coalition, based in
Chesapeake, Va., had responded to the puppet show by sending every
member of Congress petitions demanding that the arts endowment be
abolished.
   ``The Atlanta Arts Festival is supposed to be a family affair,''
Robertson said in a statement. ``If the weirdos on the federal dole
do not stop peddling obscenity and pornography, members of Congress
will hear from angry voters in November.''
   Robertson, who was a presidential candidate in 1988, blanketed
Congress with the petitions as the House braced for an expected
floor showdown next week over proposals to impose new
anti-obscenity curbs on the $171 million federal arts agency.
   One of the proposed amendments, sponsored by Rep. Phil Crane,
R-Ill., would abolish the NEA. The main bill would extend the
agency's life for five years beyond Sunday, when its statutory
authority expires.
   Lichtenstein and the Georgia Council on the Arts, which received
$400,000 from the NEA this year, denied that any federal funds were
spent on the Atlanta festival or the puppet show.
   Festival officials said the puppet show, staged as a
``surrealistic morality play'' for adult audiences only, was
financed entirely by ticket sales and concession receipts, without
support from any government source.
   Atlanta puppeteer Jon Ludwig, who wrote and designed the show
titled ``Zeitgeist,'' denied Robertson's charge that the
performance featured ``approximately five minutes of simulated
foreplay between two puppets followed by an exhibit of oral sex
acts.''
   ``This was a scene about temptation,'' Ludwig said. ``It was
intended to be satirical. After all, what literally happened is
that two pieces of plastic rubbed against each other.
   ``It was not simulated oral sex. It's impossible. How can
puppets do that? They don't even have the parts. It was like
finding children playing with Ken and Barbie dolls in the back room
and calling Pat Robertson,'' Ludwig said.
   Robertson's protest apparently originated with the Rev. John
Norton, a 55-year-old Methodist minister from the Atlanta suburb of
Marietta, who said he wandered into the puppet show at the festival
last Friday night.
   ``I have no problem with oral sex,'' Norton said the next day.
``But an open oral sex show for children to visualize and
experience in one of their popular forms of entertainment is more
than I felt belonged on public display.''
   Ludwig said the show won a standing ovation from the audience of
800 people and a favorable review in the local press. Patricia
Gann, the festival's executive director, said the only complaint
came from Norton.
   Ms. Gann said a half-dozen children watched the 45-minute show,
even though the audience had been warned repeatedly - through
posted signs and pre-performance announcements - that the
production was suitable for adults only.

   Nelson Mandela will leave next

the African National Congress has announced.
   Mandela, 72, has traveled widely as ANC deputy president since
his release from 27 years' imprisonment last February. The black
nationalist leader visited the United States in June.
   The itinerary announced Thursday called for Mandela to arrive
Oct. 8 in Paris for a meeting with French President Francois
Mitterrand, then travel to Moscow on Oct. 9.
   He would also visit India, Malaysia, Brunei, Australia,
Indonesia and Japan before returning to South Africa on Nov. 2.
   The ANC aims to bring an end to white minority rule in South
Africa, where 28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.
The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate
districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Luckless Sudan - Every Calamity That Can Befall
a
People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not many Americans have ever thought much
about the Sudan but, for the State Department, that East Africa
giant suddenly has become a problem that is making a lot of
diplomats sit up and take notice.
   It's hard to imagine a more luckless place than Sudan, a country
three times the size of Texas with the potential to be Africa's
breadbasket. But it has been plagued by virtually every calamity
that can befall a people - drought, civil war and misrule.
   The Sudan story lacks the drama or the security component of the
Persian Gulf for U.S. policy makers. It is, above all, a story of
human deprivation on a massive scale, a story of millions of
desperate people, many of whom are dying slow deaths.
   Things are bad and getting worse, and U.S. officials hope to be
able to talk about the situation with Sudanese President Omar
el-Bashir, who was arriving in New York this afternoon for the
United Nations summit meeting on children.
   When describing el-Bashir's tenure as head of a military
government, U.S. officials no longer bother about diplomatic
niceties.
   ``I think it would be well if Sudan's leaders looked back at the
last drought (in sub-Saharan Africa). Eleven of 13 governments were
overthrown by popular outrage by failure to respond,'' said Andrew
Natsios, the top U.S. official for foreign disasters.
   ``Half the country is starving to death. That is a recipe for
massive political convulsions.''
   Among other alleged misdeeds, Natsios accuses el-Bashir of
ordering air raids on a barge carrying food supplies this past week
at a time when top officials of his government were seeking $150
million in new food aid from the United States.
   The presumed purpose of the bombing missions is to prevent food
from reaching the hungry in territory held by southern-based rebels
who have been fighting northern domination for years. Other air
raids have taken place near U.N. food relief sites, Natsios said.
   The Sudanese Embassy had no comment on the allegations.
   More than a quarter of a million Sudanese died of disease and
starvation two years ago. Experts predict an even worse situation
this year - some estimates run into the millions - because the
drought has returned and interest among donors in a major relief
effort is feeble so far. Other contributing problems are rampant
nepotism and the country's ``awful economic policies,'' according
to a State Department expert.
   Chronic civil war between the Moslem north and the non-Moslem
south has produced more than 3 million displaced people out of a
population of more than 20 million. More than 380,000 have fled to
refugee camps in Ethiopia.
   Numerous foreign relief workers have abandoned the Sudan in
frustration. As an example, a train loaded with food earmarked for
the hungry in southern Sudan, officials say, has been sitting idle
for more than a year at a northern site, denied permission by the
government to deliver its cargo.
   With the help of a 100,000-ton food contribution, the United
States and other foreign donors were able to keep human suffering
in Sudan to a minimum last year. Now, Sudanese authorities have
asked the United States for a food donation 10 times last year's
combined total.
   How the United States will respond has been the subject of
internal deliberations this week. There is another issue, almost
forgotten in the face of more pressing problems, on the
U.S.-Sudanese agenda: Sudan is one of the few countries worldwide
that has shown sympathy for the Iraqi side in the Persian Gulf
crisis.

<HEAD>Japanese Prime Minister Leaves for U.S., Middle East Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu left for New York
today to begin a 12-day trip to the United States and the Middle
East in which he will explain Japan's response to the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Kaifu will be the first leader of a major industrialized country
to visit the gulf region following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait nearly
two months ago.
   He will travel to Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman
after attending a United Nations conference on children in New York
and meeting with President Bush on Sunday.
   One topic of discussion is certain to be the plan unveiled by
Kaifu on Thursday to send non-combat military personnel overseas
despite Japan's no-war constitution.
   They would participate in a U.N. Peace Cooperation Corps, which
Kaifu stressed would only be used for peacekeeping activities and
would not need to be armed.
   The government argues that creation of the corps would not
require revision of Japan's post-World War II constitution that
renounces the use of force to settle international disputes.
   It is unclear if the corps would be available to assist U.S. and
other forces in the Saudi Arabian desert because Parliament will
have to approve the plan.
   Kaifu's announcement came amid criticism from the United States
that Japan should do more to support the multinational force
arrayed in the gulf to deter further aggression from Iraq, which
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Japan has pledged to contribute $4 billion, including $2 billion
in logistical support for the gulf forces and $600 million in
emergency commodity loans to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan.
   The remaining $1.4 billion is to be disbursed to those three
nations and other countries hurt by the crisis.
   Japan last month also pledged to send about 100 civilian medical
personnel to the Middle East.

<TEXT>
   A computer-generated telephone call tells an
11-year-old boy he can win a trip and a prize if he dials a 900
long-distance number and answers the question: ``What is the name
of Batman's car?''
   He gets confused when he calls the number and keeps dialing
repeatedly. He gets nothing. Mom gets a $120 phone bill.
   A TV ad asks kids to call Santa Claus using a 900 number. The
callers then are told that Santa is in the bathroom, so they should
call back later. No Santa. Big phone bills.
   Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., cited these and other ``horror
stories'' Thursday while urging the House telecommunications
subcommittee to adopt his bill to impose strict federal regulations
on the burgeoning 900-number audiotext industry.
   Gordon said ``$120 is not as much as some have lost on these
services, but it is more than many people have for such nonsense.''
   He said it was ironic that the telephone company involved in the
Batman case, in which the answer was ``the Batmobile,'' had a
policy of not carrying services directed at children.
   ``The attitude seems to be, `Policy or no policy, if there is
money to be made, let it slide,''' Gordon said.
   There is a lot of money to be made in 900 calling, said the
subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. He said the
industry had revenues of $480 million in 1989 and is expected to
double that this year. By 1992 it is expected to be a $3.2 billion
industry, he said.
   Most of the audiotext industry is legitimate, witnesses said.
But they said companies that impose excessive charges and use
deceptive ads for games of chance, sex talk, easy credit pitches
and chats with Santa Claus are creating the prospect that a few
renegades will kill off a valuable public service.
   Markey cited examples of consumers being duped into calling a
900 number ``to obtain a pre-approved credit card or to claim
nonexistent prizes, only to receive a message to call yet another
900 number at a cost of up to $25 per call.''
   Gordon's bill, among other things, would require free blocking
of 900 numbers; free introductory messages describing the service;
clearly stated charges and billing procedures; and a one-time
opportunity to stop charges incurred through misunderstandings or
unauthorized use.
   The Federal Communications Commission would be given oversight
of the audiotext industry.
   Industry representatives testified against the bill. They said
it would increase costs for everyone and that more vigorous
enforcement of existing state and federal laws was the answer. They
also said they were starting to police themselves.
   Audiotext companies offer many popular services to callers who
dial 900-prefix numbers, including weather, sports, theater
information, one-way ``chats'' with music personalities, shopping
information, stock quotes and political pitches. The calls usually
are carried by long-distance companies that do the billing under
contract with the service provider.
   Customers typically receive flat-rate or per-minute charges for
the calls on their phone bills.
   ``It is my view that 900-number services have the potential to
be the telemarketing consumer fraud problem of the 1990s,'' said
Daniel Clearfield, executive deputy in the Pennsylvania state
attorney general's office.
   ``Each day throughout the United States, thousands of telephone
consumers are being victimized by 900 numbers which provide either
fraudulent or worthless services or which fail to adequately
advertise or otherwise inform callers of their 900-number call,''
Clearfield said.
   He said attorneys general in Pennsylvania, Texas, Missouri,
Kansas, California, Wisconsin and New York were pursuing remedies
to 900-number fraud, but that national standards were needed. He
said the Federal Trade Commission also was conducting some
investigations.
   Ken McEldowney, executive director for San Francisco-based
Consumer Action of California, rejected industry contentions that a
few bad apples were spoiling the 900 barrel.
   He said a national survey by his group concluded that ``most
advertised 900 numbers are unfair at any price.''

<TEXT>
   The Social Democrats from the two Germanys
have merged and launched their uphill battle to end Helmut Kohl's
reign as chancellor of united Germany.
   The merger of the two left-leaning parties on Thursday came six
days before the Germanys are united and Kohl, head of the
conservative Christian Democrats, becomes chancellor of the united
country.
   Elections for a new all-German parliament are slated for Dec. 2.
The Christian Democrats, bolstered by Kohl's drive for quick
unification, have a healthy lead over the Social Democrats in
opinion polls.
   On Friday, the Social Democrats are slated to formally confirm
Saarland governor Oskar Lafontaine as their candidate for
chancellor in December elections.
   ``There is nothing more important for us at this moment than
helping Oskar,'' said former chancellor Willy Brandt, the honorary
chairman of the Social Democrats.
   ``This is a great day for the Social Democrats of Germany,''
Brandt said as he addressed the party's congress.
   Banned by Adolf Hitler's Nazis, the Social Democrats regrouped
in West Germany after World War II. But the Social Democrats in
East Germany were forced to merge with the Communists in 1946 and
ceased to exist.
   The party was revived after the popular revolution and the
downfall of the Communist government last fall.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, chairman of the West German Social Democrats,
also became leader of the merged party. The East German Social
Democratic leader, Wolfgang Thierse, became one of his four
deputies.

<HEAD>Bill to Compensate Miners, Downwind Residents Clears Congress</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uranium miners and Western residents who lost
their health from exposure to nuclear weapons tests would get a
formal apology and compensation under legislation headed to
President Bush's desk.
   The House on Thursday approved a bill that authorizes $100
million for a Radiation Exposure Trust Fund to pay people who
developed cancer from either mining uranium or because they lived
downwind of the Nevada test site for the atomic bomb.
   The Senate passed the bill previously.
   ``We are here saying that as a nation in the dangerous and
difficult post-war period we were confronted with a brand new
technology,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who led debate on
the bill before the voice vote. ``Feeling very much threatened and
needing that technology for our defense, we acted hastily.''
   He said residents in the test area were exposed to levels of
radiation ``we would not allow now. Miners were sent into the mines
without even the slightest protection against the material they
were being asked to mine.''
   Frank said the bill is an acknowledgement that the government
was wrong.
   People with cancer who lived in Nevada, Arizona or Utah downwind
from nuclear testing between 1951 and 1958, or between June and
July 1962, would be eligible for compensation under the
legislation.
   Uranium miners in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming and
Utah from 1947 to 1971 who got cancer also would be eligible.
   It would be up to the Justice Department to determine the amount
of compensation for each person and process claims.
   A driving force behind the legislation was Stewart Udall, a
former congressman and interior secretary, whose brother Rep.
Morris Udall, D-Ariz., is chairman of the House Interior Committee.
   He represented the uranium miners in a lawsuit against the
federal government. The courts ruled the government was immune from
prosecution because national security dictated a need for the
uranium, but judges involved in the case urged the miners to seek
redress from Congress.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, who once was a lawyer for the downwind
residents, sponsored the legislation.
   Owens said the government, knowing the dangers of nuclear
fallout, did not conduct testing when the wind was blowing toward
the higher population centers in California and Las Vegas.
   ``In very real fact, the federal government made the decision to
bomb these people to whom this bill makes an apology and a
compensatory payment of a small amount,'' he said.
   Further legislation is needed to appropriate the money to
actually pay the victims if this bill becomes law.

   A $70 million satellite is sending important
weather data today because engineers overcame a problem that
threatened to send it crashing to Earth.
   ``We would have lost half of our capability,'' Russell Koffler,
deputy assistant administrator of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said Thursday of the near-failure.
   The satellite, known as NOAA-11, is the more important of two
that orbit the Earth pole-to-pole, providing visible and infrared
pictures to forecasters, Koffler said.
   ``It actually takes the temperature measurements of the
atmosphere over the globe,'' he said. ``It provides the basic
underlying information for the guy who gets on the radio and says
it's going to be sunny tomorrow.''
   The satellite was launched Sept. 24, 1988, from Vandenberg Air
Force Base, Calif. It operates normally, at an altitude of 529
miles, with four gyroscopes - three for directional control so it
won't tumble, and one backup.
   One gyro failed in August 1989 and the backup was put into
service. That left no spare and NOAA asked programmers at General
Electric's Astro Space Division in Princeton, N.J., to write new
computer instructions to allow the satellite to operate on a single
gyro.
   That work was to have been finished in 1991, but ground
controllers recently sensed that a second gyro was about to fail.
Programmers from GE, NOAA and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration accelerated the effort, which cost $230,000.
   The instructions were radioed to the satellite Aug. 8.
Forty-four days later, last Friday, the ailing gyro failed as
predicted.
   Koffler said there are no more miracles in store for NOAA-11 if
the operative gyro fails.
   ``The other one can't be used to control the satellite,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Congress Moving to OK Bigger Tapping of Strategic Reserve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving to give President Bush
authority to conduct a bigger ``test'' sale from the nation's
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins provided the opening Thursday for
a second release of oil from the stockpile without forcing the
declaration of an energy emergency by saying the 5-million-barrel
sale Bush ordered a day earlier is too small to test the system.
   Recalling that the administration just two weeks ago had
threatened to veto a larger test sale, Rep. Phil Sharp, D-Ind.,
asked Watkins at a hearing by House Energy and Commerce
subcommittees how large a test he would like.
   ``Three times the (5 million) number is the number,'' the
secretary replied. ``We want to run half a million barrels a day to
test the system.''
   The strategic reserve, created in 1975, consists of 590 million
barrels of crude oil stored in salt deposits in Texas and
Louisiana.
   ``We welcome the change,'' said Sharp, who had his staff draft a
bill authorizing a new test sale of 15 million barrels and gather
the signatures of several other committee members on it while
Watkins was testifying.
   Anticipating no opposition in the Senate, Sharp said the bill
could be on Bush's desk in two weeks.
   Despite the test sale that Bush's spokesman said was also
intended to ``signal'' traders to slow their speculation on the
future cost of oil, spot prices for West Texas Intermediate Crude
rose another 90 cents per 42-gallon barrel Thursday to $39.55,
double its price in July.
   ``We're not going into this test with the idea that it's going
to bring the cost down $8 a barrel or something,'' Watkins said.
``That's not the purpose. If (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein makes
another threat, the market could jump again irregardless of the
test sale.''
   He emphasized that the test is ``not a drawdown'' but will
``give us optimum readiness to open the spigot if that is required
in the future.''
   Bid notices on the 5-million-barrel test were to be sent out
today and the Energy Department expects to award contracts for it
in mid-October.
   Bob Porter, a department spokesman, said an average of 167,000
barrels of oil - far short of the 500,000 barrels that analysts say
is needed to drive prices down - will be released daily for 30
days.
   ``We think the bulk of the oil will be transported in
November,'' Porter said. ``If the pipelines or tankers can take it,
we'll deliver it to them the next day. But typically it takes 30
days for the commercial docks to schedule pickups.''
   Top lawmakers, including Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, have been urging Bush for more than a month to tap the
reserve to stem the rapid rise in oil prices since Iraq's takeover
of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the subsequent embargo removing about 4.3
million barrels daily from the world market.
   Before acting Wednesday, Bush had repeatedly contended there was
no actual shortage and no justification for tapping the
government's emergency oil stockpile just because of rising prices.
   Watkins reaffirmed that policy Thursday, but acknowledged it
could change quickly because of the growing tightness in world
supplies as winter nears.
   He also cited problems that Saudi Arabia is having with corroded
pipelines in trying to make up for production from Iraq and Kuwait
and increased chances of fire or explosions at U.S. refineries now
running near 100 percent capacity.
   ``U.S. crude stocks are above normal as of the moment, but they
could go below normal by the end of October,'' Watkins said.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, said the administration needs to follow up on the test
sale by calling on West Germany and France at a meeting today in
Paris of the 21-nation International Energy Agency to also tap
their emergency stockpiles.
   ``The tankers that left Iraq and Kuwait when the crisis began
will soon unload their cargo,'' Dingell said. ``No more oil will
follow, and at that point the real effects of a shortfall will hit.
The administration should prepare for those eventualities now.''

<HEAD>Brown Says He Doesn't Think Jackson Will Run in 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown says
his ``personal view'' is that Jesse Jackson won't make a third run
for president in 1992.
   Right now, no Democrat is showing much interest in a 1992 race,
and Brown said he intends to encourage the presidential ambitions
of prominent Democrats after the 1990 elections.
   ``I'm not advocating smoke-filled-room politics,'' the party
chairman said during a wide-ranging interview. ``I am advocating
common-sense, pragmatic politics which says we're serious about
winning the White House and which says, if you're serious about
that, you've got to take some risks and you've got to be willing to
take some heat.''
   ``We haven't been real successful five of the last six times and
to ignore that fact is really lacking in good judgment,'' Brown
said this week, referring to the fact the Democrats have elected
only one president since 1968.
   Brown also said he won't urge the Senate leadership to grant
floor privileges to Jackson as a shadow senator from the District
of Columbia.
   ``I'm for statehood,'' Brown said during the interview. ``I'm
not into the perks debate.''
   As for presidential politics, Brown, who helped Jackson in the
closing stages of his 1988 campaign, said, ``I think it's a tougher
political environment for him now, a more difficult political
environment, more to overcome.''
   Brown said he believed it was appropriate for a party chairan
to urge people to get into the race and also to urge candidates to
drop out when it is clear someone has outdistanced the field.
   Brown said he was determined to ``get a consensus candidate
early in the process and start running against George Bush rather
than against each other.''
   In his two previous campaigns for the nomination, Jackson fought
on to the convention, long past the time he had any hope of
becoming the nominee.
   But when asked if he had Jackson in mind when he talked about
the need to persuade some candidates to get out of the race when
they no longer had any hope of winning, Brown replied:
   ``I think there is too much emphasis, almost to the point of
obsession, with whether Jesse is going to run or not going to run.
It's significant, but I don't think it's the principal factor in
the 1992 race. It's a decision he'll have to make and if he does,
he does; if he doesn't, he doesn't.''
   The chairman added, ``my personal view is that he doesn't run,''
but he said that view was not based on any clear signal from
Jackson.
   In fact, in the summer of 1989, when Jackson moved to the
District of Columbia, Brown predicted he would run for mayor, a
plan he still insists was Jackson's intent.
   After mulling the race, Jackson announced he would not run.
Instead, he opted for the symbolic office of shadow senator.
   In November, voters in the nation's capital will elect two
shadow senators to lobby Congress to grant the city statehood.
Jackson got close to 80 percent of the vote in the Sept. 11
primary.
   Jackson has not said he would demand access to the Senate floor,
but his certain election to the post has spurred speculation that
he would make such a request.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has kept his
silence on the subject.
   Brown said he thought it was a mistake for Jackson to run for
shadow senator and indicated he assumes Jackson would seek floor
privileges.
   ``That creates a very unpleasant confrontation with the senate
leadership,'' he said.

Hearing</HEAD>

   Neil Bush, the president's son, combatively denied
conflict-of-interest charges stemming from his role as adirector
of a failed savings and loan.
   At the final day of an administrative hearing Thursday, Bush
interrupted a government lawyer and drew admonitions several times
from the judge.
   Bush acknowledged he was a ``go-between'' for a line of credit
that Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver
extended to two developers he had business dealings with.
   But Bush said he had no financial interest in the projects for
which the credit was extended. The two developers eventually
defaulted on more than $132 million in Silverado loans.
   Bush, 35, was a director of the thrift, which failed in 1988,
leaving taxpayers with a $1 billion tab for bailing out depositors.
   On several occasions, Adminstrative Law Judge Daniel J. Davidson
warned Bush to answer questions directly and not to interrupt the
government lawyer, Stephen Hershkowitz.
   ``You're doing it again,'' Davidson scolded Bush at one point.
``But you have to wait until the counsel finishes his question,
because it's very difficult for the (court) reporter to take down
two people talking at once.''
   Bush replied, ``My lawyers advised me I should listen. I'm
sorry.''
   He quickly resumed his combative tone, however, and drew new
warnings from the judge.
   In February, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision brought an
administrative action against Bush that could lead to his being
barred from the banking industry.
   The regulators contend Bush failed to adequately inform fellow
Silverado directors of his business ties with developers Kenneth
Good and Bill Walters.
   Bush insisted he ``had absolutely no doubt'' that his business
dealings with Good and Walters did not conflict with his role as a
Silverado director. Consequently, Bush said, he did not consult
with Silverado's management about the question of a potential
conflict.
   Aside from an appearance in May before a congressional committee
investigating Silverado, Bush's fight with regulators mainly had
taken the form of briefs and counterbriefs submitted to Davidson.
   At his long-awaited appearance at the three-day administrative
hearing, Bush hadn't lost any of the defiance of his testimony on
Capitol Hill.
   Bush insisted several times that, although Good and Walters
invested in his oil company, JNB Exploration, he had no financial
interest in the projects for which they got loans from Silverado.
   Previous testimony showed Silverado extended a $900,000 line of
credit to a partnership formed by Bush and Good to explore for oil
and gas in Argentina. The line of credit, intended to persuade
Argentine officials that the venture had strong financial
resources, never was used.
   Under questioning from Hershkowitz, Bush said lawyers for Good's
company suggested Bush present the credit line proposal to the
Silverado board.
   ``I was a go-between,'' Bush said.
   Bush insisted there was no conflict of interest in his role
because he didn't stand to gain any financial benefit from the
credit line, which he described as a sort of ``letter of
referral,'' and because he abstained from voting on the proposal.
   Bush said he couldn't remember if it was his own idea to abstain
from voting on the line of credit or if someone suggested it to
him.
   Davidson will examine testimony from the hearing and in January
recommend to Timothy Ryan, Office of Thrift Supervision director,
what sanctions, if any, should be taken against Bush. Ryan is
expected to make a decision in May.
   Bush would have the right to appeal to a federal court.
   Last week, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. sued Bush and
other former Silverado directors for $200 million, alleging that
gross negligence on their part contributed to the S&amp;L's collapse.
   Bush was a director of Silverado from August 1985 to August
1988.

<HEAD>Hair Loss From Chemotherapy May be Prevented, Experts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   First a patient hears the cancer diagnosis and
then learns that the needed chemotherapy may cause temporary
baldness. For many, the loss of hair is a huge cosmetic burden
piled on the already terrible physical trauma of disease.
   But help may be on the way, according to a study published today
in the journal Science.
   Dr. A.A. Yunis, of the University of Miami Jackson Memorial
Hospital Medical Center, reports that he and his colleagues have
discovered ``by chance'' that an experimental cancer drug blocks
hair loss in laboratory rats injected with some chemotherapy
agents.
   If the finding can be translated into drugs to treat humans, an
expert said, ``it would be of tremendous benefit'' to cancer
patients who now must endure the characteristic mark of
chemotherapy baldness.
   Yunis said his team made the discovery while testing
cancer-fighting drugs on lab rats that had been injected with
leukemia cells.
   Half of the rats were treated with a drug called cytosine
arabinoside, or ARA-C. The rest were treated with a combination of
ARA-C and an experimental drug called ImuVert.
   ``We found, lo and behold, that the rats with ARA-C only became
nude. They lost all their hair,'' said Yunis. ``The ones with both
ARA-C and ImuVert, however, did not lose hair at all.''
   Yunis said his group then tested ImuVert with another common
cancer drug, doxorubicin, or DX. He said they found that rats with
the DX-ImuVert combination also experienced no hair loss, while
rats receiving only the DX lost hair on their heads and shoulders.
   ImuVert combined with a third cancer drug, cyclophosphamide,
however, did not prevent hair loss in the rats, said Yunis.
   Dr. Ed Gelmann, chief of the department of medical oncology at
Georgetown University in Washington, said that if a way can be
found to prevent hair loss ``patients will feel much better about
chemotherapy.''
   Chemotherapy baldness is nearly always temporary. The hair
usually grows back after the treatment cycle.
   Nonetheless, said Gelmann: ``A lot of patients focus on hair
loss because it is so apparent. It can be quite a stigma. It would
be a tremendous benefit to eliminate hair loss as long as it did
not change the efficacy of the cancer chemotherapy.''
   Yunis said that ImuVert appears to help combat leukemia while it
is preventing chemotherapy baldness. He said the drug teamed with
ARA-C halted the progression of leukemia in all but 20 percent of
the laboratory rats tested. This result was better than among rats
treated with ARA-C alone, he said.
   Dr. Gregory Curt, director of the clinical oncology department
at the National Cancer Institute, said controlling hair loss during
chemotherapy ``is a very serious thing for patients.''
   ``The two things that concern patients the most about
chemotherapy are nausea and that some people can get bald,'' he
said. There are drugs to control the nausea, but there is no pill
to block the hair loss.
   ``For both men and women, it is one of the side effects that
concerns people the most because it changes one's body image,''
said Curt.
   The physician said he remembers at least two patients who were
so concerned about the loss of hair that they actually refused
lifesaving chemotherapy.
   ImuVert now is being tested as a chemotherapy agent against
brain cancer. Yunis said it could be several years before it is
approved for use on patients.
   He said the discovery also gives researchers a clue that may
help find even more effective drugs to block hair loss among
chemotherapy patients.
   He said ImuVert is a drug known as a biological response
modifier because it alters the way some cells in the immune system
act. If the precise effect of this drug on the hair follicles could
be identified, then new drugs with this action could be developed,
said Yunis.
   Science, which today published the University of Miami research
report, is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   Coauthors of the paper with Yunis are Atif M. Hussein and
Joaquin J. Jimenez of the University of Miami, and Catherine A.
McCall of Cell Technology Inc.

   More than half a million people developed AIDS
worldwide in the past decade, but ``the worst is yet to come,'' an
expert said at an international AIDS symposium.
   ``There is clearly going to be a wave that makes the experience
of the '80s look relatively small - at least a 10-fold increase,''
said Dr. Jonathan Mann, director of the International AIDS Center
at the Harvard School of Public Health.
   ``This is still a very new pandemic,'' Mann told delegates at a
conference Thursday sponsored by the Morehouse School of Medicine
and the federal government's Research Centers in Minority
Institutions. ``The worst is yet to come.''
   A pandemic is an epidemic over a large region.
   Mann cited projections saying at least 8 million people
worldwide are infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. That
includes an estimated 5 million in Africa, and 1 million in the
United States.
   A comparatively low 600,000 AIDS cases occurred worldwide in the
1980s, he said.
   ``We are not in a good state of affairs when it comes to AIDS
and HIV in the United States and in the world,'' concurred Dr.
James Curran, medical director of the HIV-AIDS division at the
Centers for Disease Control.
   The United States, where 4,000 AIDS cases were reported between
1981 and 1984, reported that same number in just the past four
weeks, Curran said.
   ``Those at the greatest risk have to learn to change their
behavior or die. It's that simple,'' Curran said.
   Nationwide, 146,746 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States since the disease was first detected in 1981; 89,761
patients have died.
   The U.S. Public Health Service projects between 390,000 and
480,000 AIDS cases in this country by the end of 1993.
   ``We are far from turning a corner with AIDS in our own
country,'' Curran said.

   Employees of a savings and loan hugged
a 71-year-old man after he shot and killed a man they said was
trying to rob the thrift.
   Charles Still shot Anthony Cipriano Tapia, 43, of Albuquerque,
during the alleged robbery Thursday at Sandia Federal Savings and
Loan, police spokeswoman Mary Molina Mescall said.
   Police questioned Still for several hours after the shooting but
he didn't arrest him. The district attorney's office will
investigate, Mescall said.
   Witnesses said a robber walked into the bank, pulled out a gun
and demanded money. Authorities refused to release any other
details of the attempted robbery or the shooting.
   In the bank parking lot after the shooting, two employees of the
thrift hugged and thanked Still. Sandia employees described him as
a regular customer.
   Still refused to discuss the shooting. His wife, Pearl, said
Thursday her husband carries a weapon, but refused to say anything
else about him.
   Still's friend and frequent companion on hunting and fishing
trips said Still is honest, patriotic and obeys the law.
   ``He's not a troublemaker,'' Chester Gregory said. ``He doesn't
start arguments. He's just about the nicest man you ever saw.
   ``But he's not the kind of guy you can push around either.''
   A sticker on the front door of the Stills' home in southeast
Albuquerque identified the residents as lifelong members of the
National Rifle Association.
   Another sticker said: ``Warning! This house protected by a
12-gauge shotgun three nights a week. You guess which three.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas A. Twetten, a career Central
Intelligence Agency officer, has been named the CIA's deputy
director for operations.
   The CIA said in a statement released Thursday that director
William H. Webster had appointed Twetten, 55, to succeed Richard F.
Stolz, 64, as head of the division that oversees espionage and
covert activities.
   Twetten will assume his new duties Jan. 1, the agency said.
Stolz, who served in the agency from 1950 to 1981 and then returned
to CIA duty in 1988, is retiring.
   Webster's statement said Stolz ``has made an enormous
contribution in charting the role of human intelligence in a
rapidly changing world. He has dealt with some extraordinarily
challenging issues, serving the agency and the country with great
distinction.''
   Twetten has served as Stolz's deputy since June 1988.

   Toy bears and elephants are being recalled by
two distributors, according to the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.
   The commission said in a Thursday announcement that consumers
may return the toys to the stores where they were purchased for a
refund.
   The 3,600 ``Music Maker'' toy elephants are being recalled by
the F.J. Strauss Co. of North Bergen, N.J., because of excessive
lead in the paint and small parts that could choke young children
if broken off.
   The Music Maker is a blue plastic elephant, painted yellow in
some places, with a xylophone, drum, bells and ball popper built
into the top.
   The commission said it carries the legend ``STRACO MADE IN
CHINA.''
   No injuries from the toy have been reported, the commission
said.
   Being recalled by Soft Things Inc. of Brooklyn, N.Y., are 30,240
Video Bear Babies. The commission said the eyes and nose of the
stuffed bear could break off and choke young children.
   The 5{-inch toy comes in various colors with a sewn-in tag
reading ``China Berries for China House, Los Angeles XXX MADE IN
CHINA.''
   The commission said it knew of no injuries from the bear.

   A nine-month prison term has been handed a
former U.S. foreign aid official who admitted accepting $11,130
from a medical consultant awarded contracts for public-health
assistance programs.
   John Massey on Thursday also was fined $2,000 by U.S. District
Judge George Revercomb. Massey was the last of three defendants
receiving prison terms for corrupting the award of contracts for
aid projects in Central America.
   The No. 2 official who supervised humanitarian aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras earlier this year was given a 12-month sentence
by another federal judge. The consultant was sentenced on Sept. 11
to eight months in prison and fined $6,000 for bribing an
undercover operative of the Agency for International Development's
inspector general's office.
   Massey, 51, had previously pleaded guilty plea to conspiring to
defraud the government, a charge that carried a maximum five-year
prison term.
   The AID project officer in Guatemala City, Guatemala, from 1987
to 1989, he admitted receiving the money during a time when he was
giving the consultant inside information about contracts the agency
was preparing to put out for bids. Massey also admitted helping the
consultant write bid proposal documents.

<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Theo
Mitchell called black supporters of his Republican rival ``house
niggers'' and ``Uncle Toms.''
   Mitchell's comments, aired Thursday on WWDM-FM of Sumter, were
in reference to the Rev. Richard Fisher, bishop of the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, who this week announced his
endorsement of Gov. Carroll Campbell. Campbell is vying for
re-election in November.
   Mitchell, seeking to become South Carolina's first black
governor, also criticized five members of the South Carolina Black
Mayors Association for their support of Campbell.
   ``These are house niggers. These are the individuals we must
expose. And let it be known that black leadership is no longer
going to be this type to sell out its people,'' said Mitchell, a
state senator.
   ``These are Uncle Toms. These are black prostitutes who are
being still bought by white politicians, selling out their people,
selling their integrity, their dignity and their honor,'' Mitchell
said.
   Meanwhile, Bishop Johnnie M. Smith, a black Republican from
Greenville, urged Mitchell to apologize to the black leaders he
called prostitutes in comments earlier this week.
   ``The thing that concerned me is that if today, I were to hear
Governor Campbell say to white leaders, `If you don't vote for me,
something's wrong with you,' then I would think something was wrong
with him,'' Smith said.

   Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Hugh
Parmer accused Republican incumbent Phil Gramm of hiding support
from someone associated with a failed financial institution.
   Parmer said Gramm bought property from Louis Gibson, former
board chairman of First Republic Bank in Corsicana, now NCNB
Texas-Corsicana.
   He described the $25,000 loan to buy the property as a
``personal loan'' from Gibson. Gramm spokesman Larry Neal and
Gibson said it was an owner-financed loan, secured by the property.
   The senator did nothing wrong and the charge is ``a new handful
of mud,'' said Neal.
   Parmer said Gramm reported the transaction in his 1984 ethics
filing from the House of Representatives, but not in any of his
Senate ethics filings since 1985. He said Gramm was required to
report the loan.
   Neal said Gramm only was required to report the transaction when
it occurred.

<HEAD>Branstad Adviser Contacted Lender In Brother's Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Terry Branstad's former top aide
and current campaign adviser contacted federal lenders on behalf of
Branstad's brother during negotiations over a farm loan.
   The aide, Des Moines attorney Doug Gross, said that he spoke
with Farm Credit Service officials about the loan but said he did
so as a private lawyer after being contacted by Branstad's brother,
Monty.
   ``He was thinking about suing them and called me and asked me
about the merits of the suit,'' Gross said. ``I never talked to the
governor about it, ever.''
   The flap first surfaced in reports published by the Mason City
Globe-Gazette. The newspaper quoted Farm Credit officials as saying
Gross called to urge them to ``sell to Monty at a low figure.''
Monty Branstad had been bargaining over land that had been
foreclosed on but that he wanted to repurchase.
   Gross said he spoke twice to Ray Mechem, assistant vice
president for Farm Credit Services' Mason City office.
   ``I identified myself as an attorney from Des Moines,'' Gross
said. ``I told him this had nothing to do with the governor.''
   Gross said Farm Credit Services officials told him they would
not sell the land back to Monty Branstad for less than the assessed
value.
   ``He ended up paying the assessed value and didn't even talk to
me about it,'' Gross said.
   Democratic State Chairman John Roehrick said the account raises
``new questions about whether Republican Governor Terry Branstad
used his political clout to improperly help his brother, Monty
Branstad, obtain preferential treatment for his troubled farm
finances.''
   Gross and Branstad aides labeled the Democrats' assault as
``pretty sleazy.''

<HEAD>New Iraqi Intimidation Draws Fire; West Meets On Oil Supplies</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto NY6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF DONN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Western governments and Kuwait's emir have angrily protested new
Iraqi efforts to intimidate diplomats and civilians, and
industrialized countries sought ways to cushion the blow of the
anti-Iraq embargo on world oil supplies. Kuwait's exiled emir,
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, was expected in Washington
today for talks with President Bush, while 21 nations gathered in
in Paris to discuss how to guarantee adequate stocks of crude.
   Oil hit $40 a barrel Thursday, exactly eight weeks since Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein sent his troops into Kuwait and increased
his share of world oil reserves to 20 percent. Oil sold for $22 per
barrel before the invasion.
   The U.S. Navy did its best to keep a tight seal on Iraqi marine
trade Thursday. The Pentagon said a U.S. frigate fired warning
shots at an Iraqi tanker in the Red Sea after it ignored an order
to halt.
   In a surprise move Thursday, Britain announced the restoration
of diplomatic ties with Iran. They were severed after the late
Ayatollah Khomeini's death decree against author Salman Rushdie for
his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Neither side publicly linked the move to the Persian gulf
crisis, but Iran's relations with the West have been improving. It
has said it is cooperating with the U.N. economic boycott of Iraq.
   At the United Nations in New York on Thursday, the deposed
Kuwaiti emir spoke emotionally of his homeland. Al-Sabah said
``rape, destruction, terror'' now reign in Kuwait, overrun by
Iraq's ``naked, brutal aggression.''
   The Iraqi delegation stalked out when al-Sabah began speaking,
but the Kuwaiti emir won a standing ovation from the General
Assembly.
   Bush's invitation for al-Sabah to visit the White House today
underscores the U.S. view that the emir is still the legitimate
ruler of Kuwait.
   Iraq's Interior ministry Thursday published a new law saying
citizens of Kuwait - which Iraq has proclaimed its 19th province -
have until Oct. 31 to adopt Iraqi citizenship. It did not say what
would happen to those who failed to meet the deadline.
   Iraq was the target of a blistering new round of Western
criticism on Thursday after a threat against diplomats who shelter
foreigners. In a note delivered to some Western embassies on
Wednesday, Iraqi officials said giving sanctuary to a foreigner was
punishable by death.
   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry refused to elaborate on the message,
but Iraqi officials speaking on condition of anonymity said it was
referring to Iraqis harboring Westerners, not to diplomats giving
refuge to their own nationals.
   Western governments reacted with anger anyway.
   ``Iraq's threat makes it impossible to take seriously any
pretensions on its part to be a civilized state,'' Britain's
Foreign Office said.
   In Paris, a French Foreign Ministry spokesman in Paris called
the threat ``utterly intolerable.''
   The State Department reported Thursday that another American had
been picked up in Kuwait a day earlier, bringing the total of
Americans detained by Iraq to at least 101.
   Thousands of Westerners trapped by the invasion have been
prevented from leaving. Some are being held by Iraq at key
installations to serve as human shields against potential attack.
   In Kuwait, Iraqi forces have been trying to starve diplomats out
of their embassies.
   About 300 to 350 U.S. citizens are stranded in Iraq, and 600 to
700 in Kuwait, according to figures released Monday by the State
Department. Altogether about 6,000 Westerners are in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   On the Red Sea, a team from the USS Elmer Montgomery boarded the
Iraqi tanker Tadmur after firing the wiring shots. The team
inspected the tanker, but it was empty. It was allowed to proceed.
   The incident marked the fourth time a U.S. warship fired shots
to enforce the U.N. trade sanctions.
   Scores of U.S. and other warships have assembled in the gulf
region to enforce the embargo against Iraq, which invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil, land and money.
   Iraqi forces in and around Kuwait include an estimated 430,000
troops. About 165,000 U.S. soldiers have been deployed in Saudi
Arabia and the gulf. Thousands of Arab and European troops also
have been sent to the Saudi desert.
   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Thursday unveiled a
plan to dispatch Japanese military personnel to the gulf region in
what would be the first such overseas deployment of Japanese forces
since World War II. But Kaifu said they would be unarmed and kept
away from combat.
   He left Tokyo today for the United States and visits Bush on
Sunday.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said Saddam's security shield is
so thick and mobile that the only way the Iraqi president will be
toppled is if one of his intimate advisers turns against him.
   ``He doesn't allow a whiff of opposition,'' said an official.
   Another, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Saddam is
believed to be preparing ``for what he sees as an inevitable
battle'' over Kuwait but is unwilling to provoke war himself.
   Meanwhile, relief officials, especially in Jordan, struggled to
cope with the huge influx of refugees from Iraq and Kuwait. At a
desert transit camp in Jordan, there were several disturbances
involving Indian refugees angered by poor conditions and long
delays.
   Authorities worried about the possibility of large-scale riots.

   Iraq has tightened its vise on occupied
Kuwait through systematic terror in an effort to wipe out remaining
resistance, residents and officials say.
   Iraqi authorities are trying to force-feed Kuwaitis a new Iraqi
nationality. They have ordered Kuwaitis to trade their nationality
documents for Iraqi citizenship and change their Kuwaiti currency
for Iraqi dinars.
   In his latest pledge to retain control over Kuwait, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein told a visiting delegation of Islamic
theologians Monday he will never withdraw ``even if we have to
fight for 1,000 years.''
   Iraq has increased its troop strength in Kuwait to 430,000,
adding 70,000 soldiers in just two weeks, U.S. officials said in
Washington this week. Iraq also continues to deploy tanks and other
armor within striking distance of Saudi Arabia, the Dfense
Department officials said.
   Meanwhile, refugees from Kuwait are still trickling out,
bringing more tales of terror.
   A Kuwaiti refugee interviewed in the Saudi capital of Riyadh,
who gave his name only as Abdullah, told of a man he knew who
complied with the Iraqi order to turn in firearms.
   ``The police shot him in the head, put his body in a garbage
bag, and left it in front of his house,'' he recalled.
   Egyptian doctors who recently left Kuwait, where they had been
working at hospitals, said Iraqi soldiers claim officers lied to
troops to trick them into taking part in the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``They were originally told ... that troops all over the Arab
world were gathering together and going to Egypt, and then they
would invade Israel,'' Jilan Abdel-Wahab, one of the doctors, told
a news conference in Cairo.
   Another doctor, Yehia Mohammed, said he saw Iraqi soldiers shoot
to death five Kuwaiti children for joining anti-invasion
demonstrations. Ten other children, brought to his hospital with
bullet wounds, also died, he said.
   The U.S. ambassador-designate to Kuwait, Edward Gnehm Jr., told
reporters Monday that Kuwaiti health officials told him 22 babies
born prematurely died when Iraqi troops removed them from
incubators they stole.
   Gnehm has been named to replace current ambassador Nathaniel
Howell, who is holed up inside the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   Defiance runs strong among Kuwaitis who have stayed, said
Michael McMurtry, a British geologist still in Kuwait, in a letter
published in The Times this week.
   ``Nearly all Kuwaitis remaining can be said to belong to the
Kuwait resistance,'' he wrote.
   He said the resistance had killed Iraqi troops and destroyed
ammunition trucks.
   ``Although they are helplessly outnumbered, the resistance have
played an invaluable role in keeping the Iraqi troops on the
alert,'' he wrote.
   Some Palestinians are reportedly helping the Iraqis run the
occupied country, but Palestinians sympathetic to the Kuwaitis have
also emerged, the daily Al-Khaleej, a newspaper in the United Arab
Emirates, reported Thursday.
   The paper also reported that Iraqi units were ``turning
cemeteries into military barracks ... because they know a Kuwaiti
respects the dead and believes it is sinful to kill anyone in a
burial site.''
   Iraq's efforts at changing the face of Kuwait continued with
Thursday's announcement that ``first-class'' Kuwaiti citizens - or
native-born Kuwaitis whose parents are also Kuwaiti - must adopt
Iraqi nationality by Oct 31.
   On Monday, Iraq said the Kuwaiti currency, the dinar, would be
invalid after Oct. 6 and must be exchanged for Iraqi dinars.
   Iraqis continue to be resettled in Kuwait as part of an effort
to change Kuwait's demographics, according to a dissident Iraqi
minority.
   But Iraqi soldiers are suffering from food shortages and low
morale themselves, said the dissident group, the Kurdistan
Democratic Party of Iraq, in recent statements.
   Exiled Kuwaiti officials say Iraq is trying to force Kuwaitis
from their homeland and repopulate it with Iraqis and others
sympathetic to Baghdad's government.

<TEXT>
   Alaska stands to reap a windfall of
millions of dollars in oil revenue thanks to the Persian Gulf
crisis, and Gov. Steve Cowper wants to sock most of it away for a
rainy day.
   Cowper and many lawmakers argue that a fund is needed to ease an
expected drop in oil revenues later this decade as Alaska oil
production declines. Oil, gas taxes and royalties account for about
85 percent of state revenues.
   The governor said Thursday if oil prices don't collapse before
the end of the year, the state will have a ``substantial surplus.''
   The increase in state revenues since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2
already has erased the projected deficit that prompted Cowper in
July to veto $325 million from the $2.9 billion fiscal 1991 budget.
   Each $1 rise in the price of one barrel of oil adds $150 million
to Alaska's treasury over a year. This year's budget was based on
oil selling at $19.33. Prices this week have been double that.
   Cowper, who declined to seek a second term and leaves office
Dec. 3, said he will propose that the 1991 Legislature restore some
budget cuts when it convenes in late January but place most of the
windfall in a budget reserve.
   Voters will decide Nov. 6 whether to amend the state
constitution to create a reserve fund.
   ``It's prudent to do because oil prices can go down as quickly
as they went up,'' Cowper said.
   Also, the huge Prudhoe Bay oil field, the nation's largest, is
in decline. When it dries up, so will Alaska's free ride on oil.
The state has no state sales or income taxes.
   It's uncertain how next year's new Legislature will react to the
windfall.
   Some lawmakers likely will push to deposit the cash in the
Alaska Permanent Fund, an $11.2 billion state savings account
funded with a fixed percentage of the state's oil and mineral
revenues since 1977.
   But tapping that fund for future government expenses may be
difficult. The fund's principal by law cannot be spent, and there's
strong public and political opposition to spending the earnings for
other uses. It also would reduce the size of dividends each Alaskan
receives every year from the fund.
   Past legislatures spent oil surpluses on roads, sewers, power
projects, buildings and other publi  works projects in the young
and largely undeveloped state.
   ``The rationale will be, `Hey, we've got the money, let's sow
the seeds for the future while we can,' '' said Sen. Pat Pourchot,
a Democrat.
   But Rep. Ramona Barnes, a Republican, predicted there will also
be strong public pressure to save the cash.
   ``The public is not going to stand for the Legislature to just
spend that money willy-nilly on everything that comes by,'' she
said. ``They're going to expect that money to be saved for a rainy
day.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese Cabinet official has apologized to the
U.S. ambassador for remarks in which he compared black Americans to
prostitutes, the government said today.
   Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama, 64, visited U.S. Ambassador
Michael Armacost Thursday to convey his apology to ``the government
and people (of the United States),'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
   The visit came in the wake of sharp criticism from the State
Department and American blacks after the newly appointed Kajiyama
said last Friday that foreign prostitutes in Tokyo ``ruin the
atmosphere'' of the neighborhoods they move into.
   ``It's like in America where neighborhoods become mixed because
blacks move in, and whites are forced out,'' Kajiyama said.
   The minister told Armacost, ``I have retracted the remarks and
apologized to those concerned, but again, I would like to deeply
apologize to your government and people. And I would like you to
convey my apology to your government and people.''
   In response, Armacost said the ``insensitivity'' of Kajiyama's
remarks had shocked all Americans, not just blacks.
   The comments were only the latest by a Japanese politician to
provoke outrage from U.S. minorities. In 1986, for instance, former
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone precipitated an outpouring of
criticism from the United States when he implied that blacks and
hispanics had a low intellectual level.
   On Monday, a State Department said ``such remarks are offensive
to the American people.''
   Ralph Neas, executive director in Washington of the Leadership
Conference on Civil Rights, called them ``reprehensible and
racist.''
   A group of blacks living in Japan released a statement of
protest Thursday and is also planning a demonstration in front of
the Justice Ministry building next Tuesday, according to local news
reports.
   ``American blacks want to be friendly to Japanese because we
think Japanese are also colored people. But Japanese see themselves
as different. They indulge in finding commonality between
themselves and whites,'' John Russel, an American researcher here,
told the Asahi Journal, a liberal weekly magazine.
   He said the Japanese media has also contributed to creating a
negative image of blacks as ``barbaric, and superior only in sports
and sex.''
   J. R. Dash, a foreign securities house employee in Tokyo, also
told the Asahi Journal: ``Japanese are trying to get around the
issue by stressing they don't understand minority problems because
Japan is an isolated, island nation. But ignorance should not be
stressed as an excuse.''

   A small civilian plane accidently
strayed over the heavily armed Korean border today and flew 10
miles into Communist North Korea before turning back, officials
said. Some reports said there had been gunfire.
   The Cessna aircraft apparently veered off course in bad weather
and turned around on its own after the pilot realized he was in
North Korea, military sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Some reports said there had been gunfire. Yonhap, the national
news agency, quoted unidentified military officials as saying South
Korean marines heard about 200 rounds of gunfire, probably from the
Northern side of the border about the time the incident took place.
   The marines heard an aircraft overhead and fired one warning
flare to guide it southward, the Defense Ministry said. The
ministry declined to confirm reports of gunfire.
   A ministry spokesman, requesting anonymity, said four Korean F-5
fighters scrambled to intercept the plane and guided it back to
Seoul's Kimpo International Airport where it landed without damage.
   The official identified the pilot as Song Jae-sun, 55, an
employee of Koroyo Industrial and Development Co., a subsidiary of
the conglomerate Hyundai.
   The Koroyo firm is engaged in a land reclamation project near
Sosan, about 55 miles southwest of Seoul along the coast.
   South Korean military officials said the pilot was being held
and the incident was under investigation.

   President's Bush's handling of the Persian
Gulf crisis has been endorsed in a resolution adopted by a House
committee, although the panel avoided approving any future military
action.
   The Foreign Affairs Committee's voice vote came Thursday after
three weeks of painstaking effort and in the wake of an earlier
effort that unraveled amid fears that lawmakers might be issuing an
implicit blank check for war.
   The panel acted in a hastily called session after Chairman Dante
Fascell, D-Fla., worked out final details with president's national
security adviser, Brent Scowcroft.
   The full House is expected to consider the resolution on Monday.
   Also on Thursday, a new $7.5 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia
proposed by the Bush administration was gaining qualified support
on Capitol Hill.
   Included in the Saudi arms assortment is 150 advanced M-1A2
tanks, six Patriot anti-missile batteries with 384 missiles, a
dozen Apache ground-attack helicopters with 155 Hellfire missiles,
1,750 improved TOW anti-tank missiles with 150 launchers, nine
multiple-launch rocket systems with 2,880 rockets, seven KC-130
tanker planes, 10 C-130 cargo planes and 10,000 assorted trucks,
transporters and trailers.
   In other congressional matters, legislation that would provide
about $400 million in special benefits for military personnel
stationed in Saudi Arabia, won Senate Armed Services Committee
approval.
   Also contained in the bill is a provision setting up a system by
which Congress and Bush administration officials would oversee and
manage the expected donations from foreign governments to defray
the cost of Operation Desert Shield.
   The committee, in adopting the measure, wanted to ensure that
the Pentagon ``couldn't go out and spend money on some weapons
systems that are unrelated'' to Desert Shield without congressional
approval, said Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   Among the benefits in the legislation are $11 million in free
postage, $265 million to make danger pay retroactive to Aug. 1 and
$12 million to compensate some people for leave they cannot take.
   The pared down version of the legislation seemed less disturbing
to supporters of Israel than a previous $21 adaptation. But there
remained a few worries about some elements of the revised package.
   ``It is a big improvement,'' said Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif. But
he said he planned to closely question administration officials
about the tanks, the Apaches and the Patriots at a hearing next
week. Levine suggested some of the concerns might be calmed if the
administration comes up with a counterbalancing security package
for Israel.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams called the proposed Saudi sale
urgently needed.''
   Contained in the immediate package are items deemed necessary to
meet Saudi defense needs in the current crisis, including weapons
that can be delivered from current stocks or quickly taken off the
production line. Sources said the White House planned to send
Congress a follow-up request in late January for the other $14
billion worth of weapons it believes the Saudis need, including
new-generation F-15F fighter planes.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee session broke up at one
point when it appeared no agreement could be reached between
committee Democrats and the White House on a Persian Gulf
resolution could be reached.
   A primary hangup was lawmakers' nervousness that any
congressional resolution might be seen as implicitly endorsing any
future use of force by the United States, said Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind..
   As the resolution has gone through the drafting stages over the
past three weeks, there have been echoes of the Tonkin Gulf
resolution, a 1964 act that was seen as authorizing widening U.S.
involvement in Vietnam.
   Fascell sought to make it clear that the document would only
approve Bush's actions so far in the gulf crisis, and leave out any
mention of next steps. It voiced support for Bush's ``emphasis on
diplomatic efforts, international sanctions and negotiations under
the auspices of the United Nations'' to achieve the goals of
forcing Iraq out of Kuwait and restoring Kuwait's previous
government to power.
   Similar internal debates are under way on both sides of the
Capitol between those who believe Congress should take a formal
role in the gulf situation and those who prefer to keep their
political distance from it.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Away City Hall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walter DeBow and his family fought
City Hall, and now they own it.
   DeBow, 55, suffered permanent brain damage after being beaten
into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city jail more than six
years ago. He and his family were awarded $3.4 million in a 1985
court settlement with the city.
   With interest, that amount has grown to $4 million, and the
debt-ridden city has not paid at least $1 million of it, said the
DeBows' attorney, Clyde Kuehn.
   So on Thursday, Judge Roger Scrivner of St. Clair County Circuit
Court awarded the East St. Louis Municipal Building and 220 acres
of city-owned property to the DeBows.
   Kuehn said the DeBows planned to sell the property. ``Definitely
my clients want what they were awarded, and I think this is
necessary to accomplish that,'' he said.
   City officials estimated the municipal building alone cost $10
million to build. City Attorney Eric Vickers said the value of the
properties far exceeds anything owed the DeBows.
   ``I think this decision is just a major miscarriage of justice
and demonstrates bias against the city of East St. Louis,'' Vickers
said. ``The city has not defaulted on its payments. It's
ludicrous.''
   Another lawyer for East St. Louis, Irvin Williamson, said the
city would ask a court to stay the judgment pending appeal.
   ``If the court allows the judgment to stand against the city,
what's next? The police cars? The fire trucks?'' Williamson said.
   East St. Louis is plagued by debt estimated at $47 million. Gov.
James R. Thompson signed a $34 million bailout bill Aug. 30. The
money will come from state bond issues.
   The population of the city, which has one of the highest murder
rates in the country, fell from 55,000 in 1980 to 40,000 this year,
the Census Bureau estimates.
   Mayor Carl E. Officer declined to comment on the judge's order.
Aldermen were flabbergasted.
   ``It's amazing,'' said Alderman Percy McKinney. ``I guess we pay
rent from now on.''
   State law gives DeBow's family the right to evict the city in
seven days, but Kuehn said his clients weren't likely to do that.
   Walter DeBow was comatose for three months following the January
1984 beating, which occurred while he was being held on a traffic
charge of illegal transportation of alcohol. He is being cared for
at a head-injury rehabilitation center in New Jersey.
   Kuehn has taken the city to court several times since DeBow was
awarded the $4 million. In March 1988, he won an order to freeze
the city's assets, stopping city workers' paychecks and threatening
to push the city into bankruptcy.
   The city later tried to pay off the debt by issuing nearly $5.2
million in bonds.But Thursday, Kuehn said the actual value of the
bonds was only $2.8 million, prompting him to ask the judge to
award the city property to DeBow's estate to make up the
difference.
   DeBow also will continue to hold the bonds and receive biannual
bond payments, Kuehn said.

<HEAD>Baker to Meet With Vietnamese Foreign Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Vietnam's foreign minister are expected to discuss such topics as
efforts to form a new government in Cambodia and the fate of more
than 2,400 Americans missing since the Vietnam war in a meeting
scheduled for this weekend.
   Baker has arranged the half-hour session for Saturday with
Nguyen Co Thach, who is also deputy prime minister. It is the
latest move by the United States toward improved relations with its
former bitter foe.
   Some 1,700 Americans are still unaccounted for in Vietnam and
others elsewhere in Indochina.
   The meeting was announced Thursday in New York by State
Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler. Baker was in New York
conferring with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   His meeting with the Vietnamese leader will be the highest-level
U.S. session with a Vietnamese official since the 1973 Paris peace
talks brought the Vietnam War to a close.
   In July, the U.S. altered its policy of shunning Vietnam except
for occasional inquiries about missing Americans. At that time,
Baker announced that the Bush administration was withdrawing
diplomatic recognition of the Cambodian guerrilla coalition and
opening negotiations with Vietnam on settling the 11-year-old civil
war in Cambodia.
   While Vietnam has heavily influenced the Cambodian government,
Cambodia has shown recent signs of pursuing a more independent
course. The guerrilla coalition includes the Communist Khmer Rouge,
which killed at least 1 million Cambodians when it ran the country
in the late 1970s.
   Vietnamese troops ousted the Khmer Rouge in an invasion in
December 1978.
   The guerrillas and the Cambodian government have been
negotiating over formation of a Supreme National Council to run the
war-ravaged country until an election can be held under a plan
approved by the United Nations.
   The announcement said Baker wanted to discuss formation of the
council and ``its early assumption of its seat in the U.N.''
   However, Cambodian Radio reported on Wednesday that Cambodian
Prime Minister Prime Minister Hun Sen had rejected a proposal from
the guerrilla coalition to install Prince Sihanouk as chairman in
exchange for an additional seat for the Hun Sen government.
   The report said that Hun Sen felt his government should be
allotted the slot of deputy prime minister and that he had urged
his forces to keep fighting against the guerrillas.

<HEAD>General Says Soviets Remove Nuclear Warheads From Troubled Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Published reports today quote the Soviet
Union's top military officer as saying Moscow has removed nuclear
warheads from areas of the country where there is a risk of ethnic
unrest.
   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, the Soviet Union's armed forces chief of
staff, told The Washington Post that the trouble spots were cleared
of the nuclear weapons because his nation recognizes its obligation
``before mankind'' to ensure complete security over its nuclear
arsenal.
   The newspaper interviewed Moiseyev on the eve of the Soviet
official's tour of the United States.
   It was the first official confirmation that part of the Soviet
Union's 30,000 nuclear warhead arsenal was being relocated.
   While the general did not specifically identify affected areas,
the newspaper said Western defense attaches believe Central Asia,
the southern Transcaucasus region and the Baltic Republics are
involved.
   Those areas have been the scene of sometimes violent ethnic and
nationalist unrest in the past two years.
   Moiseyev said similar actions have been taken to ensure the
security of non-nuclear weapons.
   He also predicted that Iran would join forces with Iraq in the
event of a war in the Middle East, which he said could escalate
into a world war.

<TEXT>
   A court today convicted 16 soldiers
in the murder of President Corazon Aquino's husband but failed to
say who ordered the assassination which set the stage for the 1986
revolution.
   The impact of the decision was further clouded by the court's
acquittal of 20 people in the 1983 slaying of Sen. Benigno
``Ninoy'' Aquino, the country's top opposition leader at the time.
   Other defendants, including a former military chief of staff,
have fled the country to avoid prosecution.
   The verdict in the 3{-year trial was announced on the first
anniversary of the death of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who
many Filipinos believe ordered the Aquino's slaying.
   The assassination outraged many Filipinos and heralded the 1986
popular uprising that toppled Marcos and catapulted Mrs. Aquino to
power.
   The three-judge court sentenced the 16 convicted defendants to
life imprisonment and ordered them to pay $300,000 to the late
senator's heirs. It was unclear if that figure is a total or if
each defendant is expected to pay that sum.
   Aquino was cut down by gunfire on Aug. 21, 1983, moments after
returning from self-imposed exile in the United States to challenge
Marcos. He had just stepped off a China Airlines jet that brought
him back to Manila to challenge Marcos for leadership of this
nation.
   ``I think not only I, but the entire Filipino people have been
waiting for the decision of the court,'' Mrs. Aquino told reporters
after today's verdict.
   Later, she said she had become frustrated by the slow pace of
the proceedings and as president would refrain from ``expressing my
true feelings'' about the verdict.
   Marcos claimed Aquino was slain by an alleged Communist
assassin, Rolando Galman, who was himself shot to death moments
after Aquino. The 16 were also convicted in the slaying of Galman.
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28, 1989.
   The court said it could not convict Ferdinand Marcos and his
wife, Imelda, because ``there has been no evidence to prove a prima
facie case against them.''
   Those convicted included Brig. Gen. Luther Custodio, former
chief of the airport security command. He is terminally ill with
cancer. The rest of the convicted were security guards on the
tarmac of Manila's airport when Aquino's plane arrived.
   Chief defense lawyer Rodolfo Jimenez said the 16 would appeal to
the Supreme Court.
   Among those acquitted were Rep. Jose Aspiras, former tourism
minister; former Air Transport Minister Jose Singson; and Col.
Arturo Custodio, former commander of Villamor Air Base.
   In its summation, the court said evidence pointed to Constable
1st Class Rogelio Moreno, one of the 16 convicted, as the
triggerman. But the court noted that the broader question of who
ordered the killing could not be answered.
   Following the verdict, Aquino's sister, Rep. Teresita Oreta,
said she was disappointed that the court could not establish the
mastermind.
   ``I would have wanted a clearer statement on who ordered the
killing,'' she said. ``These are soldiers who will not move without
any orders.''
   Twenty-six people, including former military Chief of Staff Gen.
Fabian Ver, were originally charged with the killing but acquitted
in December 1985 by a court appointed by Marcos.
   Six months after Marcos was ousted, the Supreme Court overturned
the acquittals and ordered a new trial, saying Marcos engineered
the original verdict.
   The first trial was marked by frequent street demonstrations and
rallies, but the second attracted virtually no spectators apart
from relatives of the accused. Newspapers rarely covered it.
   The Aquino case has often been cited as an example of the
country's inefficient judiciary. Midway during the proceedings, the
Supreme Court disbarred chief prosecutor Raul Gonzalez after he
publicly charged justices were misappropriating funds.
   One defendant died during the trial and three others, including
Ver, have fled the country. Philippine law does not permit trials
in absentia.
   During a coup attempt in December, more than 12 of the
defendants escaped from a military stockade, but all eventually
surrendered.

   Hostages of a schizophrenic who hated
Americans and claimed to hear voices endured seven hours of bizarre
conversations and gunfire in a hotel bar.
   They also saw one of the hostages killed and seven other people
wounded before the gunman died in an explosion of police bullets.
   ``When he took a head count of us he started counting his rounds
as well,'' said Doug Moore, among 33 people held by Mehrdad Dashti.
``He watched every single move. Every time someone moved, he
flinched.''
   Dashti, 30, commandeered Henry's Publick House and Grille at the
Durant Hotel, a block south of the University of California's
Berkeley campus, early Thursday.
   The siege, punctuated by Dashti's gunfire and the escape of some
hostages, ended when police decided they could not talk him into
coming out and stormed the bar.
   Dashti was described as a paranoid schizophrenic on an Alameda
County mental health form found in his cluttered Berkeley
apartment. Police knew of no clear motive for the attack.
   ``He was apparently very confused,'' said Berkeley police Capt.
Phil Doran. ``Deranged is not a bad description.''
   Dashti, who grew up in Iran and came to the United States eight
years ago, expressed animosity toward Americans.
   ``The foreigners in there, he told them he wasn't going to
bother them. He was after the Americans,'' Moore said.
   He claimed the ``government owed him $16 trillion for mental
telepathy work and this was his way of getting it back,'' said
Moore, 25, a student at the nearby campus and manager of the hotel
bar, a popular gathering place for students.
   Dashti, in an unmailed letter to President Bush obtained by the
San Francisco Examiner, claimed to have spoken with ``invisible
intelligent species'' from the world of the dead.
   Moore said Dashti also disliked blond women. During the ordeal,
Dashti made them take off their pants but let them keep on their
underwear, hostages said.
   Carrying a briefcase, Dashti walked into Henry's shortly before
midnight and had a drink, Moore said. Moore made a ``last call''
and the remaining crowd of more than 40 people clustered at the
bar.
   There was a bang. Dashti had concealed a pistol, a revolver and
an ``assault-type pistol'' in the briefcase, police said. Moore
said he looked up to see Dashti point a gun into the crowd and fire
several more shots.
   ``I saw the gun and I hit the ground,'' said John Landa, 21, who
was shot in the right arm but escaped with several others.
   San Francisco police Sgt. Jerry Senkir said Dashti was named in
a March 1989 warrant charging grand theft in connection with
cashing two checks, worth more than $16,000, stolen from a bakery.
   Dashti's roommate, 19-year-old Fred Smith, described him as
``pretty religious'' and fond of guns.
   John Sheehy, 22, of Lafayette, died after he was shot in the
chest at close range. The gunman allowed a man at the bar to carry
him outside, then ordered the others into strategic positions
around the room.
   During the next seven hours, Dashti terrified his hostages by
shooting ``for the hell of it,'' Moore said. ``He would say, `Cover
your heads,' and then shoot.''
   Dashti used two male hostages as mouthpieces, having them answer
telephone calls from police trying to negotiate with him and shout
his demands out the window.
   One of his demands was that San Francisco Police Chief Frank
Jordan ``drop his drawers'' on television, Doran said. Moore said
Dashti had ``lots of negative things to say'' about San Francisco
police.
   Dashti, who received a degree in engineering from San Francisco
State University, also was upset he didn't get a student loan for
UC Berkeley, police said.
   The gunman, who drank beer and whiskey, suggested everyone have
a drink and invited the hostages to talk about anything, Moore
said.
   Dashti began a guessing game. He thought up numbers between one
and 15 and the others tried to guess, Moore said.

<HEAD>Resumption Of Iran-Britain Diplomatic Ties Raises Hostage Hopes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agreement between Britain and Iran to resume
diplomatic ties has raised hopes that British hostages in Lebanon
may be freed soon and that author Salman Rushdie can again live
without fear of assassination.
   The London newspaper The Guardian today quoted unnamed British
officials as saying that following Thursday's announcement at the
United Nations of resumed ties, Rushdie should be able to resume a
normal life without fear of being killed.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Iran's U.N. Mission said the
embassies will reopen in London and Tehran within a month.
   Iran cut diplomatic ties with Britain in March 1989 over
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems regard
as blasphemous.
   Iran's late religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had
called on Moslems to kill the Indian-born writer. Rushdie, a
naturalized Briton, remains in hiding under British police guard.
   Paul Handley, spokesman for Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, leader of the Church of England, said the resumption of
diplomatic ties between Iran and Britain was good news for the
three British hostages.
   Runcie's envoy, Terry Waite, was seized in January 1987 trying
to negotiate the freedom of American hostages.
   ``Of course it does not mean all the problems are solved,''
added Handley. ``But they will be much easier to solve through
normal diplomatic channels.''
   Pressure on Britain to get talking to Iran about Waite and the
two other hostages - television journalist John McCarthy and
retired fighter pilot Jack Mann - increased this month with the
release of Irish teacher Brian Keenan.
   It made Britain the only Western country which has so far failed
to get a single hostage released from Lebanon.
   Speaking on TV-AM this morning, Waite's brother David called the
move ``a major step forward'' which would allow problems between
the two countries to be resolved more easily.
   ``I just hope the families of all the other hostages don't have
to cope much longer,'' Waite said.
   Cooper's brother Paul, speaking on the same program, called the
restoration of ties ``very encouraging.''
   ``There has been an enormous amount of suspicion and hostility
between Britain and Iran and it's very important that these bridges
are built and both sides start to trust each other,'' he said.
   Another London newspaper, The Independent, reported that
following resumption of diplomatic ties between Britain and Iran,
Britain is expected to raise with Israeli the issue of Shia
prisoners in south Lebanon.
   The prisoners are held by the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army
in what the paper described as deplorable conditions.
   Iran says they are as much hostages as the 13 Westerners,
including six Americans, held in Lebanon. The 13 are believed held
by Islamic fundamentalists loyal to Iran's Shiite revolution.
   The longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correpondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Iran wanted relations with London as part of improving ties with
the West and opening up trade channels.
   Britain wanted relations with Iran partly because of the
hostages and, increasingly now, because of the realignment in the
Middle East following Iraq's seizure of Kuwait Aug. 2.

   Marvin Gaye, shot to death by his father 6{
years ago, was honored with a Hollywood Walk of Fame star and
praise from Motown friends Stevie Wonder and Berry Gordy.
   ``Let us pledge we can make a better world in the spirit of
Marvin Gaye,'' Wonder told the Gaye family and hundreds of fans and
friends gathered Thursday on Vine Street near the Sunset Boulevard
headquarters of Motown Records.
   Gaye, born in 1939, originally was a member of the 1950s vocal
group The Moonglows and joined Motown in the early 1960s. He
released a stream of hit records, including ``I Heard It Through
the Grapevine,'' ``What's Going On'' and ``Ain't No Mountain High
Enough,'' one of several duets with Tammi Terrell. He left Motown
in the late 1970s and made the 1982 album ``Midnight Love'' for
Columbia Records.
   ``There are many special talents that only come along once in a
while,'' said Gordy, the founder of Motown. ``A talent like Marvin
Gaye comes along only once. There will never be another Marvin
Gaye.''
   Gaye's three children, Frankie, Nona and Marvin III, and his
brother, Frankie, were at the unveiling. Others attending included
Smokey Robinson; Motown president Jheryl Busby; Dick Clark; Lou
Rawls; Natalie Cole and eight members of the Japanese chapter of
the Marvin Gaye fan club.
   Representatives of Armed Forces Radio were on hand and taped the
ceremony for troops in the Persian Gulf.
   Gaye was shot to death on April 1, 1984, following an argument
with his father, Marvin Sr., who received five years probation.
Gaye's parents did not attend Thursday's ceremony.

<HEAD>CDC: Smokers Know Their Health Would Be Better Without Cigarettes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even the most veteran of smokers know their
health could improve if they kick the habit, federal researchers
say.
   The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that 83 percent of
smokers believe they could avoid health problems if they quit, and
85 percent believe there are health benefits for those who quit
even after 20 or more years of smoking.
   The figures were taken in a canvass of 4,351 smokers, ages 25 to
64, during a random telephone survey conducted from January to
April 1989.
   The CDC reported that about 90 percent of college-educated
smokers ages 55 to 64 indicated they believe there are health
benefits for long-term smokers who quit.
   Knowledge of the advantages of not smoking was lowest in smokers
in that age group who had no college education; 67 percent of them
said they saw a benefit to quitting late in life.
   The survey was part of a battery of new studies intended to
freshen decades-old warnings about smoking, CDC officials said.
   The overall message, though, wasn't new.
   The research ``found that quitting smoking increases life
expectancy,'' said Dr. Ronald Davis, director of the CDC's Office
on Smoking and Health in Rockville, Md.
   ``Even though we knew quitting smoking was good for you, we
never really had an idea of how much the risk goes down after
quitting,'' Davis said.
   According to the CDC, risks associated with smoking drop
dramatically - in some cases almost from the moment the last
cigarette is snuffed out.
   The Atlanta-based CDC concluded that smokers gain an average of
5 pounds after quitting; only 4 percent of those who quit gain more
than 20 pounds.
   The psychological effects of nicotine withdrawal - irritability,
difficulty with concentration, sleep disorders, increased appetites
and cigarette cravings - peak after about two days, then subside
rapidly over the next several weeks, he said.
   ``We recognize that many smokers don't quit because they think
they might gain some weight, or suffer withdrawal,'' Davis said.
``We are trying to get the message out that these effects go down
very quickly, so smokers should do all they can to get beyond those
first two weeks and increase their chances of becoming permanent
non-smokers.''
   The CDC also cited a study of pregnant smokers in Ohio which
found that women who stopped smoking before pregnancy or during the
first four months of pregnancy would have the same risk of
delivering low birth-weight babies as women who never smoked.
   The CDC report came two days after Surgeon General Antonia C.
Novello issued a report that said older smokers could increase
their life expectancy and improve their health if they quit, even
after decades of smoking.
   According to her report, 50 million Americans smoke or chew
tobacco and 390,000 die every year from smoking-related diseases.
Novello said about half of living Americans who tried tobacco
products have quit.

   Giant balloons, built by the French to hop
slowly across Mars' surface during a Soviet space mission, are
undergoing field tests in California's Mojave Desert.
   The six-day series of low-altitude tests being conducted by
French, Soviet and U.S. engineers started Thursday over dry
lakebeds, lava and boulder fields and sand dunes near Barstow and
Desert Center.
   Tests were scheduled today on lava fields about 40 miles
southeast of Barstow, after the successful half-mile test Thursday
on flat Coyote Dry Lake.
   ``It's a test of the system to see if it works over Marslike
terrain,'' said Harris Schurmeier, retired associate director of
the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Mars Balloon project
manager for The Planetary Society.
   The delicate balloon was intentionally destroyed after the test.
The French brought about 10 balloons for the test flights,
Schurmeier said.
   The 30-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide cylindrical balloons will be
aboard two spacecraft the Soviets plan to launch into orbit around
Mars in a 1994 mission, Schurmeier said.
   Each orbiter will deploy an entry capsule, which will parachute
toward the red planet, the fourth from the sun. Before landing,
each capsule will deploy a balloon.
   ``The resuls are very good,'' said Christian Tarrieu, Mars
Balloon project manager for the National Center for Space Studies
in France.
   The transparent, mylar balloons are designed to explore a large
area of Mars without having to negotiate difficult terrain. The
balloons are filled with helium and nitrogen, so they act as both
gas and hot-air balloons.
   ``During the day, the sun heats up gas in the balloon and the
whole thing lifts off the ground,'' Schurmeier said. ``Then the
winds blow it around. When it cools at night, it goes back toward
the ground.''
   He said the French and Soviets hope the balloons will operate
for 10 days - the life of the batteries they will carry - covering
a distance of 600 to 900 miles.
   A gondola hanging beneath each balloon probably will carry a
television camera and instruments to measure atmospheric
temperature, humidity and clarity, Schurmeier said.

   A federal jury believed a hot burst from a
Caesars Palace steam bath kept Rodney Dangerfield from performing
at the casino-hotel and awarded the comic $725,000.
   ``The truth won out,'' Dangerfield said. ``I wouldn't have gone
through this unless I was right.''
   Dangerfield's bitter legal battle with the Las Vegas resort
culminated Thursday when jurors said Caesars was responsible for a
March 1988 steam bath accident that left him unable to perform
because of eye injuries.
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Bruce Aguilera, a lawyer for
Caesars Palace. ``We'll have to have our lawyers look at the
case.''
   Jurors awarded Dangerfield $500,000 for pain and suffering and
$225,000 for shows he missed after the March 1988 accident.
Dangerfield sued Caesars for $5 million in damages and $225,000 for
missed performances.
   The bug-eyed comic, who has made a career out of the premise
that he receives no respect, thanked jurors outside a court
elevator.
   ``We showed Rodney some respect,'' an unidentified juror said.
   The jury said Caesars was obligated under a contract to pay
Dangerfield for the missed shows because the injury should have
excused him from performing. Jurors also rejected Caesars' $100,000
countersuit against its former headliner.
   Dangerfield, 68, criticized Caesars for filing papers in court
before the trial accusing him of drug use. He called the
accusations ``nonsense and untrue.''
   ``I'm surprised they went to that level to degrade me falsely
like they did,'' he said. ``All they did in this entire trial was
to try to degrade my character.
   ``I wasn't concerned with the amount of money,'' he said.
``Money is money. I was concerned about the truth.''
   Dangerfield said Henry Gluck, chairman of the resort's parent
Caesars World Inc., had refused to settle for $225,000.
   Dangerfield missed five shows the week of the accident, claiming
Caesars was negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath he
used immediately after his performances.
   The hotel, in its countersuit, claimed Dangerfield breached his
contract by not performing shows as scheduled and contended during
the 2{-week-long trial that the comedian showed no signs of
permanent injury from the accident.
   Dangerfield testified he was hit in the eyes by a burst of steam
as he opened the door to the steam room.
   Caesars introduced evidence that Dangerfield went out two nights
he was supposed to perform. A doctor who examined Dangerfield after
the steam bath incident said he thought Dangerfield could perform.
   But an ophthalmologist hired by Dangerfield's attorneys said he
examined Dangerfield three times in the last year and concluded he
continues to suffer pain caused by the steam injury.

   Rocker Dee Dee Ramone was arrested on a
marijuana possession charge in a drug sweep of a Greenwich Village
park, police said.
   Ramone, 39, was among 26 people arrested Thursday in Washington
Square Park, said Charles Campisi, police deputy inspector.
   An undercover officer observed Ramone buying marijuana, police
spokesman Edward Burns said. He said police found a marijuana
cigarette and a small bag of the drug in Ramone's possession.
   The bass player and a founding member of the rock 'n' roll band
the Ramones was released on his own recognizance on the misdemeanor
charge.
   Ramone, whose real name is Douglas Calvin, faces a maximum
sentence of nearly a year in jail if convicted.
   The arrests came after undercover officers watched and
participated in drug buys, Campisi said.
   Nine people were charged with the sale of marijuana and 17
people were charged with possession, he said.
   The Ramones, Blondie and Talking Heads led the so-called new
wave rock movement in the mid-1970s. The Ramones cut their first
album in 1976.

<TEXT>
   A locksmith so skilled at burglary that he
once made a police training videotape was cleared of 1,000 Florida
break-ins but was a suspect in 100 Maryland burglaries, police say.
   Richard D. Makofski, 36, was arrested Sept. 20 and held without
bond on three burglary charges while police investigate more
break-ins in Baltimore County, police Cpl. Stephen Doarnberger
said.
   Makofski, of Columbia, was considered a suspect in 100
burglaries in the county dating to March 1989, Doarnberger said
Thursday.
   In 1984, Makofski was charged with 63 burglaries in nearby
Howard County, pleaded guilty to three and was sentenced to three
years in prison.
   His burglary skill so impressed Howard County authorities that
they asked him to teach a class on burglary methods and detection.
Makofski also made a training videotape.
   In November, Makofski was implicated by the Palm Beach County,
Fla., sheriff's office in 1,000 burglaries in southern Florida. At
the time, investigators seized 12{ pounds of gold ingots valued at
$78,000, lock-picking tools and surveillance equipment.
   Ellen Roberts, a Palm Beach prosecutor, dropped the case in
August, saying she couldn't prove it in court.

<HEAD>Mulroney Gets Queen's Permission to Expand Senate By Eight Seats</HEAD>
<HEAD>Es: fixes typo in ``Brian'' in lead.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders say they'll try to stop Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's move to pack the Canadian Senate with
eight new members in an attempt to ram through a proposed 7 percent
sales tax.
   Manufacturers say the new tax would replace one that hurts their
competitiveness with imports. But Liberal leader Jean Chretien said
Thursday that Canadians will not back Mulroney, whose popularity
has dipped sharply in polls.
   ``When you are 15 percent in the polls and taking an abuse of
power and stacking the Senate, he might find that he will not go
very far politically with that,'' said Chretien.
   Mulroney used an obscure constitutional provision to seat the
new senators of his Conservative Party late Thursday after
receiving permission from Queen Elizabeth II. The new members take
their seats next week.
   The appointees, who serve until age 75, bring the Senate to 112
seats. Mulroney's party now has 54 seats, just three short of a
majority.
   Consumers, already paying 8 percent to 10 percent in provincial
sales taxes, are horrified at the prospect of seeing higher taxes
on their purchases, plumbing bills, haircuts and music lessons.
   But manufacturers favor the new 7 percent tax because it would
replace a 13 percent levy on Canadian industries.
   The old tax was a longstanding source of competitive
disadvantage for Canadian manufacturers, exporters and all
businesses that compete with imports in the domestic Canadian
market, business leaders say.
   A free-trade pact with the United States that went into effect
last year has raised concerns that some Canadian businesses could
be hurt by increased competition from companies over the border.
   The nation's 1867 Constitution allows the British monarch to add
four or eight members to the Senate on a request by the
governor-general, the Canadian representative to the Commonwealth.
The only other similar request was in 1873, but it was not granted.
   Mulroney used the measure as a last resort to save the goods and
services tax, which has been stalled in the Liberal-dominated
Senate. The Commons, dominated by Conservatives, supported the tax.
   Mulroney said the debate goes beyond the tax proposal itself,
arguing that the elected Commons should prevail over the appointed
Senate.
   ``The consequences for our parliamentary system are enormous,''
he said. ``What is at stake is one of the principles of our
freedom. ''
   John Haslam, a spokesman for the queen, said Elizabeth, as the
constitutional monarch of the former British colony, followed the
provisions of the Canadian Constitution in making the decision.
   But even with the additional seats, the fate of the tax could
rest on the votes of a handful of Independents.
   Before Mulroney's move, the Liberals held 52 seats and the
Conservatives 46, with one Reform Party representative, four
Independents and one Independent Liberal. The 46 Conservative
seats, combined with the eight new seats, still only make a total
of 54 - three votes short of a majority.
   Over the last two months, Mulroney has filled 15 Senate
vacancies with Conservative loyalists to narrow the gap.

   The Persian Gulf crisis is causing extra
headaches for police officials charged with security at a United
Nations gathering of 70 heads of state billed as the largest ever
of world leaders.
   The heads of state, including President Bush, and 90 foreign
ministers, scheduled to attend the two-day U.N. World Summit for
Children beginning Sunday.
   The session aims to highlight social problems in the Third World
and the inner cities of the United States. The United Nations says
it will be the largest gathering of world leaders ever concentrated
in two days.
   ``There are about 20 high-risk heads of state we're concerned
about,'' said Assistant Chief Thomas Walsh, commanding officer of
the Manhattan precincts where most of the activities will occur.
   Police officials declined to name the 20 leaders, but Deputy
Chief William O'Sullivan said a ``significant number'' are from the
Middle East.
   O'Sullivan, in charge of police intelligence, said the Middle
East crisis has introduced new elements to security efforts, but
refused to elaborate.
   A small army of police has been assigned to the 24-hour-a-day
weekend security detail: as any as 900 officers on Saturday, 950
officers on Sunday and 1,600 police officers on Monday, Walsh said.
   Officials also said members of elite police details, such as the
bomb squad, will be on 24-hour standby.
   ``There has to be a heightened sense of awareness anytime
there's trouble in the world and all the leaders are coming to New
York,'' Walsh said.
   More than 19 demonstrations are scheduled to take place over the
weekend, police said.
   Bush is expected to arrive Saturday afternoon, the day before he
is scheduled to address the children's summit.
   On Monday, Bush is scheduled to address the U.N. General
Assembly and then attend a foreign ministers economic convention at
the Jacob Javits Convention Center.

<HEAD>Martinez Fund-Raiser Features Reagan; Chiles Serves Hot Dogs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan urged the
re-election of Gov. Bob Martinez at a $1,500-a-plate fund-raiser,
while the governor's Democratic rival spoke at a $1.50 hot dog
rally at the county fairgrounds.
   The glittery GOP affair Thursday night that featured a Western
motif was juxtaposed against Lawton Chiles' folksy get-together,
which the former U.S. senator said was meant to show that ``people
are more important than money.''
   ``For a dollar and a half you can have dinner with the next
governor of Florida,'' Chiles said. ``You don't have to pay $1,500
to see the next ex-governor of Florida and the last president of
the United States.''
   Reagan asked some 1,200 Republican faithful during his speech to
``win just one more for the Gipper.''
   ``It's up to all of us to assure that Bob Martinez can continue
the job he started,'' Reagan said.
   Reagan, who just returned from a trip to Europe and the Soviet
Union, came to Orlando from his California home to pay some old
campaign debts to Martinez. The governor was a leader in the Reagan
presidential campaigns, and Florida delivered large majorities in
two elections.
   ``Bob Martinez is the embodiment of the American dream,'' said
Reagan, recalling the governor's Spanish ancestry. ``There is no
question that this race is important to Florida and the nation.''
   The former president and Martinez recalled a July 1983 meeting
in the Oval Office when, Martinez said, ``He convinced me to become
a Republican. ... Without that visit, I doubt very seriously that I
would be standing here as governor.''
   The fund-raiser was expected to raise some $2 million for
Martinez's campaign.
   At the central Florida fairgrounds, more than 300 attended the
event for Chiles and running mate Buddy MacKay.
   The Chiles-MacKay ticket also was calling its rally a
fund-raiser and was distributing cards for contributions up to the
$100 individual limit it has set for the campaign.

   Millions of Iranians took to the streets
today for anti-American demonstrations, chanting ``Death To
America!'' and denouncing the presence of U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf region, Tehran radio said.
   Iran has condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, but it has
also deplored the deployment of multinational military forces to
protect Saudi Arabia and enforce a U.N.-imposed embargo against
Baghdad.
   In a live broadcast from the streets of the Iranian capital,
Tehran radio called the demonstrations ``an opportunity for the
nation to announce its stance on the attack on Kuwait, followed by
the U.S. forces' hasty departure to take up positions in Saudi
Arabia.''
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, accused the Western forces
in Saudi Arabia of having ``defiled our sacred lands, the land of
divine revelations, just as they did in Jerusalem, by bringing
corruption, devastation, godlessness and debauchery to that
hallowed region.''
   ``This has naturally wounded the hearts of all the Moslems,''
the state-run radio said.
   It did not provide details about the number of people
participating in the nationwide demonstrations, other than saying
millions took part. It did not say where the protests were held,
other than in Tehran.
   Iran has repeatedly condemned King Fahd for allowing the U.S.
and other forces into Saudi Arabia, where Islam's holiest shrines
are located.
   Today's protests capped a week-long commemoration of the start
of the 1980-1988 war with Iraq. Iran claimed victory after Baghdad
hastily moved to make peace with Iran following the invasion of
Kuwait.
   Iraq's withdrawal of troops from Iranian territory freed up
soldiers for Baghdad to send to Kuwait and the Saudi front.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani is under pressure from vehemently
anti-Western radicals, who want him to help Iraq confront the
United States.
   The demonstrations come one day after the government announced
the resumption of relations with Britain.
   Tehran severed ties with London in March 1988 over the death
decree by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against British
writer Salman Rushdie. Khomeini said Rushdie defamed Islam in his
novel the ``The Satanic Verses.''

<TEXT>
   An unidentified gunman today fired at
the home of a Cabinet minister in an apparent assassination
attempt. The gunfire missed the official but killed a family friend
and wounded a visitor.
   According to one of official's maids, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Minister Luis Santos had leaned over to kiss a
grandchild when a bullet whizzed past him and struck the other two
people. Police said both victims were hit by the same bullet, but
it was not known if other gunmen were involved.
   A police investigator, Lt. Col. Efren Arayata, said Santos'
guards were being questioned.
   Santos, the secretary of local governments in President Corazon
Aquino's Cabinet, lives in in Davao City, 610 miles southeast of
Manila, on Mindanao island.
   Santos told The Associated Press by telephone that a 67-year-old
family friend, Marcosa Reyes, was fatally wounded in the neck, and
his 17-year-old maid, Arlene Caballero, was hit in the left
shoulder.
   ``Suddnnly there was shooting,'' said the maid. ``I don't know
where it came from. No one came in or out.'' She said Santos was
unarmed.
   The maid said she saw a man wearing a black jacket running away
from a storeroom opposite the house.
   Santos came back to Davao on Thursday at the request of local
business leaders worried about rumors of an impending coup attempt.
At a meeting, he assured them the government was stable and could
cope with any emergency.
   Mrs. Aquino has been the target of several coup attempts, the
most serious in December.
   Santos was a former police chief of Davao.
   He assumed the Cabinet post following the assassination of Jaime
Ferrer in August 1987. Two people were convicted in that killing,
but the court never established who ordered the attack.

<HEAD>Newspaper Guild Authorizes Strike If Talks Stall At San Francisco
Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A union representing about 1,200 San
Francisco newspaper workers unanimously authorized a strike if
contract talks fail to forge an agreement soon.
   ``We've been bargaining since last February, and our members are
increasingly upset that no contract has been reached yet,'' said
Bernie Beck of the Northern California Newspaper Guild's unit at
the San Francisco Chronicle.
   Local Guild President Steven R. Michael said after Thursday's
strike authorization vote that he hoped a strike wouldn't be
necessary. No deadline for completion of contract talks had been
set, he said.
   The Guild represents reporters and certain other employees at
the Chronicle, Examiner and the Newspaper Agency, the jointly owned
company that prints and distributes both papers.
   They have worked without a contract since Feb. 2. The current
contract contains an ``evergreen clause,'' which means it remains
in force until a new agreement is reached, Beck said.
   He said that publishers ``still are at some distance about work
rules'' and that negotiations about things such as wages and hours
haven't even begun.
   In all, about 4,500 employees, represented by the 10 unions, are
working without contracts at the two papers and Newspaper Agency.
The Conference of Newspaper Unions will represent all 10 unions in
wage and economic bargaining, which is expected to begin next week.

<HEAD>Pravda Claims Democratic Group Plotted to Seize Power</HEAD>

   The Communist Party daily Pravda today condemned
what it said was an opposition group's plot to seize power, and
some radical politicians expresssed fears the article was setting
the stage for a government crackdown.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev referred to rising tensions today
in a Kremlin meeting with Jack Welsh, the president of General
Electric.
   ``It really is an exciting time, so exciting that people are
completely confused,'' the Soviet leader said. ``We must ...
galvanize the whole country or we will not get out of this vicious
circle.''
   ``The command system has almost completely fallen apart,''
Gorbachev said in a television report on the meeting.
   Gorbachev now has new powers he could use to put down unrest. On
Monday, the Supreme Soviet legislature gave him the authority to
issue decrees to rescue the collapsing Soviet economy and ensure
law and order.
   He issued his first directive Thursday, ordering businesses
nationwide to fulfill supply contracts and the government to ensure
distribution.
   In today's report, Pravda said a group called the Russian
Democratic Forum had drafted a plan seeking the ``elimination'' of
the Communist Party from the political arena, the breakup of its
ranks and nationalization of its property.
   Little is known about the group, which is said to have drafted
its plan in July. The Moscow newspaper Leninskoye Znamya said it
was formed by some members of the Russian People's Front, a
grass-roots political movement.
   The front-page article in the party newspaper called the group's
plan ``destructive, permeated by a spirit of intolerance and lack
of acceptance of those unsuitable to its authoss.''
   Pravda said the document calls for a violent overthrow of the
state, and urged that it be made the target of legal scrutiny.
   Other democratic leaders distanced themselves from the group at
a news conference today.
   ``We want to act strictly within the framework of the law and
observance of law and order,'' said a joint statement from the
Inter-Regional Deputies' Group and the Democratic Russia
parliamentary opposition group.
   Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov, a radical economist, told reporters
that ``extremists'' were planning disruptive actions for the Soviet
Constitution Day holiday on Oct. 7. He said they were trying to
provoke conservatives and prompt a government crackdown.
   The statement from the two groups said such actions would ``play
into the hand of those who would like to find some kind of plot, to
have a pretext to introduce a state of emergency in the country and
devastate democratic forces.''
   ``For whom is it generally advantageous to spread rumors about a
plot? In the existing situation, only conservatives and extremists
are dreaming of destabilization,'' it said.
   Mikhail Poltoranin, a member of Democratic Russia, told
reporters a ``wave of provocations'' including demonstrations,
strikes and calls to smash windows is possible on Oct. 6 or 7.
   ``We don't want any demonstrations or strikes,'' he said.

Ties</HEAD>

   Leading Japanese lawmakers and North Korea's ruling
party agreed today that the two countries should begin formal
negotiations in November to establish diplomatic ties.
   The joint declaration, signed in Pyongyang, North Korea's
capital, marked a sharp departure from the North's past policy of
opposition to ties with countries that recognize rival South Korea.
   South Korea's Foreign Ministry today reacted with caution to the
news of improving relations between Japan and North Korea.
   Officials said they welcomed a liberalization of the North's
isolationist policy, but said Japanese moves to strengthen ties
should be made slowly and in consultation with South Korea.
   Some observers have suggested North Korea's move to establish
relations with Japan might have been triggered by South Korea's
steps toward ties with the Soviet Union, a close ally of North
Korea.
   Normalization of ties by Tokyo and Pyongyang would end 45 years
of estrangement between Japan and North Korea, beginning at the end
of World War II when the peninsula was divided.
   South Korea normalized relations with Japan in 1965.
   The joint communique came at the end of five days of talks in
North Korea between the Japanese lawmakers' group and North Korean
officials, including President Kim Il Sung. The talks were the
highest-level discussions ever by the two countries.
   The Japanese delegation, made up of lawmakers from Japan's
governing and largest opposition parties, agreed that Tokyo should
pay compensation to North Korea for its past colonial rule over the
Korean peninsula, Japanese and North Korean news reports said.
   Although the discussions were between North Korean and Japanese
political parties rather than their governments, the communique is
believed to represent a commitment by both sides.
   The Japanese group was headed by former Deputy Prime Minister
Shin Kanemaru, a powerful leader of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, and by Japan Socialist Party Vice Chairman Makoto
Tanabe.
   The Socialists have served as a bridge between the two nations
in the absence of formal diplomatic relations.
   During the talks, Kim agreed to release two Japanese seamen
detained since 1983 on espionage charges, removing a key impediment
to relations. North Korean officials said Thursday the two men will
be freed in October, Japan's Kyodo News Service reported.
   Today's declaration said the two countries should quickly
establish satellite communications links and direct air flights to
help improve relations. The two countries now have no direct
telephone, mail or travel connections.
   The joint declaration also called for an end to discrimination
against Koreans living in Japan and for peaceful unification of
North and South Korea through dialogue between the divided nations.

<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge in August sank 1.2 percent in the wake of the Persian Gulf
crisis, the government said today. It was the steepest drop since
the month following the 1987 stock market crash.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
had been unchanged in the month prior to the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait.
   Since then, however, an already sluggish economy has shown signs
of further weakening as oil prices more than doubled, slowing both
sales and production. Both consumer confidence and the stock market
also have plunged.
   The August decline was the first in four months and the sharpest
since a 1.4 percent fall in November 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plummeted 508
points a month earlier, on Oct. 19. The 22.6 percent drop was the
biggest percentage decline in stock market history. Other stock
indices also fell sharply.
   The index is designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months in advance. Three consecutive declines in the gauge are
viewed as a fairly reliable - although not infallible - signal that
the economy is headed for a recession.
   A survey of the nation's top economic forecasters in late August
and early September showed they were growing more pessimistic about
chances the economy could avoid a recession in the next 12 months.
Indeed, some believed the downturn already has begun.
   ``Up until now, a large majority of NABE forecasters have
expected the expansion to last through 1990 and 1991,'' the
National Association of Business Economists said in a report on the
survey.
   ``But this prospect is now in jeopardy,'' it continued.
``Although the median forecast shows positive real growth in both
1990 and 1991, the pace is slow enough to make two quarters of
decline in a row - the informal definition of recession - a
distinct possibility.''
   Seven of the forward-looking indicators dragged the index under
in August. They were a drop in an index measuring consumer
confidence, declining stock prices, falling orders for new plants
and equipment, a decrease in unfilled orders, a rise in weekly
unemployment claims, a drop in building permits and a fall in the
money supply.
   The only positive contributors were slower business delivery
times, an increase in orders for consumer goods, a longer workweek
and an increase in the price of raw materials.
   The various changes left the index at 144.2 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and down 0.4 percent from its level a year ago.
   If a recession could be avoided through November, the economic
expansion will have reached its eighth anniversary. It already is
the nation's longest in peacetime.
   And if it lasted until October 1991, it would set a new overall
record of U.S. economic growth, surpassing the 106 months of
continuing expansion between February 1961 and December 1969.
   Just four months ago, the NABE survey found 82 percent of the 68
professional forecasters surveyed in April and May saying the
business expansion would continue through next year.
   But, in answer to the question, ``What is the probability of a
recession within the next 12 months?'' the new survey found ``the
median probability of recession has jumped to 50 percent from prior
readings which have been in the 20-30 percent zone.''
   The latest survey of 71 forecasters also found 60 percent
anticipating a recession within three years.
   Of those, 76 percent ``believe it has already begun (in the
second or third quarter) or will begin imminently (in the fourth
quarter, or the first three months of 1991),'' the report said.
   ``Of course, information and conditions are changing rapidly as
this analysis is prepared,'' the NABE economists said. Indeed, on
Tuesday, the same day the survey results were released, the
government sharply revised second-quarter economic growth down from
an annual rate of 1.2 percent to a barely perceptible 0.4 percent.
   But even before that change, the survey showed, the forecasters
already had shaved their estimate of economic growth for 1990 from
2.0 percent in May to 1.2 percent in August, and for 1991 from 2.4
percent four months ago to 1.4 percent last month.
   Other highlights of the survey projected:
   -Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index would rise
5.3 percent in 1990, compared to 4.7 percent in the pre-oil-price
shock poll. The 1991 forecast is for a 4.9 percent increase, up
from 4.3 percent in the May survey. Inflation for all of 1989 was
4.6 percent.
   -The merchandise trade deficit would improve from $109.4 billion
in 1989 to $95 billion this year and $90 billion in 1991.
   -The federal budget deficit would total $225 billion, including
the cost of the savings and loan bailout, in 1990 and $240 billion
in 1991. The 1989 deficit was $152.0 billion.

   A grenade attack killed a French soldier's son
and injured 17 other people in Djibouti, a small Red Sea country
that serves as a staging ground for French forces deployed in the
Persian Gulf, officials said today.
   Thursday night's attack, at a cafe frequented by French military
personnel, killed the 9-year-old son of a soldier, French military
officials said. All but two of those injured were French, they
said.
   A West German and a Djiboutian were also hurt, officials said.
   French President Francois Mitterrand expressed ``horror'' at the
``cowardly attack.'' No one immediately claimed responsibility, and
it was not known whether the attack was related to the standoff
with Iraq.
   Djibouti's port and airport serve as rear bases for French naval
forces sent to the Persian Gulf region to enforce U.N. sanctions
against Iraq. The small country, a former French territory, lies on
the Red Sea at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden.
   Six of those injured remained hospitalized, including the
parents of the dead boy, according to medical officials.
   Anne Suard, first secretary at the French Embassy in Djibouti,
said the attackers arrived on foot at the Cafe de Paris, threw
grenades into the crowd on the terrace and sped away in a waiting
taxi.
   French military personnel were ordered to return to their base,
she said.
   In a message to the head of French forces in Djibouti, Gen.
Claude Gautier, Mitterrand expressed confidence the forces would
``face with determination and dignity the situation confronting
France in this region of the world.''
   One of the hospitalized victims said the slain child was seated
on his father's knee at the time of the attack, medical officials
said.
   A third grenade was found unexploded in front of the terrace of
the L'Historil Cafe, 100 yards away from the cafe where the attack
took place.
   In March 1987, an attack at the L'Historil killed 12 people,
four French military men and a French civilian, four West Germans
and three Djiboutians. That attack was allegedly committed by a man
carrying a Tunisian passport, recruited in Damascus, Syria, by a
Mideast terrorist group.
   There are 3,850 French troops stationed permanently in Djibouti,
the former French territory of Afars and Issas, under a defense
accord signed in June 1977 when the small nation gained
independence.

   President Elias Hrawi's army closed all
crossing points into rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's enclave in Lebanon's
Christian heartland today in a bid to starve him into submission.
   A communique from Hrawi's army command under Gen. Emile Lahoud
said only diplomats, Red Cross officials and lawmakers would be
allowed to drive into Aoun's zone. Civilians are allowed to cross
on foot.
   Troops set up iron barricades and installed barbed wire at all
gateways into Aoun's territory, and thoroughly searched
pedestrians' bags.
   ``I don't know how we are going to survive the blockade,'' said
a 22-year-old college student who did not want to be identified by
name. ``I'm not even sure I'll go to university on Monday.''
   By mid-afternoon, about 100 cars had driven out of Aoun's
enclave. Troops, who checked the occupants' identities, said all
were Moslems visiting friends or on business.
   The move tightened an economic blockade imposed by Hrawi's
government on July 30 against Aoun and his 15,000 mainly Christian
soldiers in pockets they hold in east Beirut and the neighboring
Metn mountains.
   Supplies of flour, food and vegetables were kept out of Aoun's
80-square-mile zone today. Fuel supplies and money transfers had
been banned for two months.
   Aoun, who refuses to recognize Hrawi's presidency, called the
new squeeze a ``blockade to starve people down to their knees.''
   ``But they are not going to escape the people's wrath. The
people will not knuckle under,'' Aoun was quoted as saying today by
the conservative Beirut newspaper Al-Anwar.
   Hrawi's mainly Moslem troops earlier took over the coastal and
mountainous crossings into Aoun's enclave from the Lebanese Forces,
the Christians' main militia headed by Samir Geagea.
   The peaceful handover put the final seal on Geagea's allegiance
to Hrawi, leaving Aoun ringed from all sides in his small pocket
with no air, sea or land outlets.
   Hrawi's government is giving the new siege two weeks to work. If
it fails, Hrawi's army backed by Syrian troops would attack to oust
Aoun by force, several Beirut newspapers reported.

<TEXT>
   The 30-year-old son of a man who
recently won a share of the state's biggest-ever lottery jackpot
was taken to jail and the hospital after apparently going on a wild
spree over several days.
   Richard D. Piasecki was taken to the Volusia County Branch Jail
on a charge of disorderly conduct Tuesday after his third arrest in
three days.
   On Thursday, he was transferred to the emergency room at Halifax
Medical Center in Daytona Beach, but hospital officials would not
release information on his condition.
   Piasecki's father, Richard J. Piasecki, who won more than $17
million, one-sixth of a record $106.5 million Florida Lottery
jackpot, had said he would share it with his children.
   The younger Piasecki's troubles started Sunday night in South
Daytona. A restaurant worker called police after Piasecki allegedly
screamed obscenities at a man driving a Mercedes-Benz because the
car was not made in America, according to police reports.
   Piasecki threatened to hunt down the driver with a shotgun, a
witness said.
   When Piasecki was stopped, he was abusive and tried to make
sexual advances toward a policewoman, police said. He later failed
a blood alcohol test, refused to sign a traffic citation and was
found to have part of a marijuana joint in his van.
   Piasecki was charged with drunken driving and possession of
marijuana under 20 grams. He was released after posting $1,000
bond.
   On Tuesday afternoon, De Land police responded to complaints
that a man was raving in front of a grocery store. There they found
Piasecki screaming vulgarities.
   He allegedly swore at a patrolman and was taken to the Volusia
County Branch Jail on a disorderly conduct charge. He apparently
paid the $250 bond and returned to De Land.
   Tuesday night, De Land police responded to a report of a fight
at the bus station. They found Piasecki screaming, again arrested
him and took him to the police station, where he refused to be
fingerprinted.
   While in the holding cell, Piasecki stuffed paper towels into a
toilet and stood in it, flushing until water spilled onto the
floor, authorities said. He was then taken back to the jail.

<TEXT>
   Four avant-garde theater performers are suing
the National Endowment for the Arts, contending they were denied
funds for political reasons.
   Karen Finley and Holly Hughes of New York, John Fleck of Los
Angeles and Tim Miller of Santa Monica filed a lawsuit in federal
court Thursday asking for the $23,000 grants for which they applied
- or at least review of their applications.
   The suit, filed on the artists' behalf by the American Civil
Liberties Union, claims the NEA ``violated their First Amendment
rights by denying their applications for impermissible political
reasons.''
   Josh Dare, a spokesman for the NEA, said today that the agency
had no immediate comment on the suit.
   Grants for the performance artists, known as the ``NEA Four'' in
arts circles, received unanimous approval in February from a peer
review board.
   But NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer vetoed the grants on June
29, and last month rejected appeals of his decision by the artists.
He was named as a defendant.
   When Frohnmayer vetoed the four grants, he refused to give any
reasons, citing a longstanding policy against discussing grant
rejections.
   In an unusual departure from that policy late in August, the NEA
issued a statement saying that Frohnmayer decided against giving
the four grants because the artists' work would not ``enhance
public understanding and appreciation of the arts.''
   Congress, at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., last year
amended the NEA appropriations bill for the current fiscal year to
prohibit federal support for works that ``may be deemed obscene.''
The action came after controversy arose over exhibits by artists
such as the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, whose work
included sexual themes.
   The four who sued Thursday, each of whom had received NEA grants
in the past, do monologues and other stage routines that generally
deal with politics, racism and sexual oppression and frequently
include strong sexual content.
   The performers had been singled out by conservative members of
Congress as examples of the NEA's willingness to subsidize works
that might be offensive.

   Millions of Iranians staged anti-American demonstrations today,
chanting ``Death To America'' and denouncing the U.S.-led forces
deployed in the Persian Gulf in the standoff with Iraq, according
to a news report.
   Turkey enforced the U.N. air embargo against Iraq by searching
planes bound for Baghdad, and Spain and South Korea joined other
nations in pulling envoys from embassies besieged by Iraqi troops
in Kuwait.
   A grenade attack killed the 9-year-old son of a French soldier
and injured 17 other people in Djibouti, a small Red Sea country
that serves as a staging ground for French forces in the Persian
Gulf, officials said today.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack
Thursday night at a cafe frequented by French military personnel,
and it was not known whether it was related to the standoff with
Iraq.
   In Paris, representatives of the United States and 20
industrialized nations met behind closed doors to discuss how to
replenish oil supplies if they are depleted by the gulf crisis.
   Jitters over the crisis sent stocks plunging on major markets.
   Stock prices dropped to the lowest point in 3{ years in Tokyo
today, and analysts blamed fear of war in the Middle East, high
interest rates and climbing oil prices.
   In New York, the Down Jones average of 30 industrials plunged
43.83 points to 2,383.66 in the first half-hour of trading. The key
barometer has shed 600 points, or lost 20 percent in value, in the
past six weeks.
   The U.S. government said today that its main economic
forecasting gauge declined 1.2 percent in August following the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the steepest drop in three years.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
had been unchanged in July. Since the invasion, however, consumer
confidence and the stock market have plunged, hurting an already
sluggish economy.
   Oil hit $40 a barrel Thursday, exactly eight weeks after Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein sent his troops into Kuwait and increased
his share of world oil reserves to 20 percent. Oil sold for $22 per
barrel before the invasion.
   Kuwait's exiled emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah,
was to meet today with President Bush in Washington. The White
House invitation underscored the U.S. view that the emir is still
the legitimate ruler of Kuwait.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, covered the protest in the
Iranian capital live from the streets. It said others were held
across the nation.
   A reporter said the demonstrations were ``an opportunity for the
nation to announce its stance on the attack on Kuwait, followed by
the U.S. forces' hasty departure to take up positions in Saudi
Arabia.''
   Iran has condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, but it has
deplored the U.S.-led multinational forces sent to protect Saudi
Arabia and enforce a U.N.-imposed embargo against Baghdad.
   However, it has said it is cooperating with the embargo. And on
Thursday, Britain and Iran suddenly announced the restoration of
diplomatic ties. They were severed after the late Ayatollah
Khomeini's death decree against author Salman Rushdie for his book
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Spain and South Korea said they were withdrawing envoys from
their embassies in Kuwait following a day of angry protests from
Western governments over Iraq's efforts to intimidate foreign
diplomats in Baghdad.
   For the past five weeks, Iraqi soldiers have been trying to
starve diplomats out of their compounds in Kuwait. At last word,
the U.S. ambassador and envoys in more than a dozen other embassies
were still holding out. The Iraqi forces have cut off water,
electricity and any supplies to the embassies.
   Baghdad says the embassies must close because Kuwait was annexed
and made a province of Iraq. The diplomatic war escalated this
month when Iraq raided several Western diplomatic compounds in
Kuwait City.
   The Spanish Foreign Ministry said today that Spain's last
diplomat in Kuwait had fled to Baghdad. But the ministry said the
embassy remained technically open, and a spokesman added, ``The
government reaffirms that it does not recognize the annexation of
Kuwait by Iraq.''
   Spain on Thursday ordered two Iraqi diplomats to leave the
country and denied two others permission to take up their posts.
   South Korea's Foreign Ministry announced in Seoul today that it
temporarily closed its embassy in Kuwait. It said Ambassador Soh
Byung-yong and the few remaining staff arrived in Amman, Jordan, on
Thursday.
   In Ankara, Turkish officials speaking on condition of anonymity
said two passenger planes, one Indian and one Soviet, landed as
ordered at the Adana airport in southern Turkey on Thursday
evening.
   Officials inspected the planes to make sure no cargo was on
board that violates the U.N. economic embargo on Iraq. The planes
then flew to Iraq to pick up Soviet and Indian nationals, officials
said.
   A Polish civilian aircraft traveling to Iraq was ordered to land
today at Esenboga airport near Ankara, officials said. They gave no
other details.
   The United Nations has authorized nations to order planes bound
for Iraq to land when they pass over their territory and submit to
searches.
   In Yugoslavia, the Croatian republic accused federal authorities
of breaking U.N. sanctions against Iraq by servicing and testing
Iraqi warplanes, the state news agency anjug said today.
   ``Despite Yugoslavia's obligations to observe the resolutions,
warplanes with Iraqi markings ... are carrying out test flights
over Zagreb,'' Tanjug quoted Croatia's Information Ministry as
saying.
   There was no immediate response from the national government.
   Iraq's army newspaper today accused Israel and Egypt of setting
up an intelligence station in Israel's Negev Desert to gather data
on the movement of Iraqi troops. Al-Qaddissiya, quoting
unidentified Arab sources, said the electronic and radar
reconnaissance station was financed by the former rulers of Kuwait
and the government of Saudi Arabia.
   Another Iraqi newspaper, the government-run Al-Jomhouriya, said
Israel would be among targets struck in the ``coming fire,'' for
which it said the United States and its allies would bear
responsibility.

   A Coast Guard airplane resumed searching today
for possible survivors of a vessel whose sunken hull was spotted
500 miles southeast of Nova Scotia.
   The identity of the vessel and the conditions under which it
sank remained unknown, said Petty Officer Lionel Bryant, a Coast
Guard spokesman.
   A Canadian plane had sighted the hull on Thursday and also saw
white, blue and brown boxes in the water that are commonly used by
fishing boats to hold their catch, Bryant said.
   Earlier Thursday, the crew of a Coast Guard plane saw an oil
slick and debris in the area, Bryant said. The Coast Guard sent the
plane out Wednesday in response to emergency signals picked up that
day.
   A Liberian-flagged merchant vessel in the area, Star Fraser,
recovered a fishing buoy and broken plastic buckets, and a second
ship also found some debris, but there no sign of survivors, Bryant
said. He said the Coast Guard had received no reports of ships
overdue.

   Iran-Contra prosecutor Lawrence E. Walsh says
he wants to complete his investigation of the Reagan
administration's worst scandal by next spring but indicates he
might bring more charges in the meantime.
   Walsh held out the possibility Thursday that his office could
seek more criminal indictments in the continuing investigation of
the coverup of U.S.-Iran arms deals and the secret delivery of
military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The independent counsel acknowledged that the ``heavy expense''
of the probe would be a factor in deciding how far to press the
almost 4-year-old investigation. Walsh's office has spent more than
$21 million.
   But he said he could not foresee closing his office until after
an appeals court rules, probably next spring, on the convictions of
former national security adviser John M. Poindexter.
   ``Ideally, the work of the office - except for possible appeals
and the trial of any outstanding indictments - should be completed
shortly after this decision,'' Walsh said.
   ``During the intervening months our investigation should be
completed,'' he said in the text of a speech at Washburn University
in Topeka, Kan.
   But Walsh indicated that new charges may be brought by the grand
jury, which sources say is examining the role of Reagan
administration officials in trying to cover up the Iran-Contra
affair.
   ``If there should be further prosecutions they will be pressed
without delay,'' he said.
   He said his staff had recently obtained new records of the
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``Also, certain witnesses are available now who were not
available during earlier stages of the investigation,'' Walsh said
in an apparent reference to Poindexter and former White House aide
Oliver North.
   Since their convictions, both men have testified before the
grand jury, which continues to meet periodically.
   Walsh's efforts will be largely focused on defending the
convictions of Poindexter and North.
   The independent counsel recently asked a federal appeals court
here to reconsider its July 20 decision to set aside North's three
felony convictions pending a hearing on whether North's
congressional testimony had unfairly tainted his trial.
   North and Poindexter both testified before Congress under
immunity grants that barred prosecutors from using their testimony
as evidence against them.
   In his speech, Walsh blamed those grants for delaying his
investigation by more than a year.
   Poindexter and North could have been tried together, but
``because of problems related to immunity, the trial court held
that they must be tried separately,'' he said.
   Poindexter recently appealed his six-month jail sentence for
lying to lawmakers and obstructing congressional inquiries into the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Walsh responded to critics who have argued that he was
prosecuting officials for involvement in a political dispute with
Congress over foreign policy.
   He contended that the prosecutions were necessary to punish
government officials who had illegally withheld information from
Congress.
   ``If Congress, as a body, asks for information, it is entitled
to information and to the extent possible, accurate information,''
Walsh said.
   When lawmakers asked about reports the Reagan administration was
secretly aiding the Contra rebels in defiance of a congressional
ban, ``the executive did not have the privilege of lying as a
tactic to achieve a political end,'' Walsh said.
   Such deception was held by trial judges to be a crime, he said.
   Walsh's remarks indicated that his original timetable for
concluding the investigation had been extended six months.
   Following Poindexter's conviction in April, Walsh had said he
hoped to make that decision by this fall. The Iran-Contra
investigation, which began in late 1986, has resulted in eight
convictions.

   Crude prices topped $40 a barrel for the first
time despite President Bush's attempt to soothe oil markets by
selling government reserves.
   Analysts said heightened tension Thursday in the Persian Gulf
helped counter Bush's decision to sell 5 million barrels of crude
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
   The November contract traded Thursday for light, sweet crude
rose 87 cents to settle at $39.54 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after trading as high as $40.10.
   It was the first time oil prices on the futures exchange passed
the $40-a-barrel mark. Each barrel holds 42 gallons.
   In early trading this morning, oil prices were narrowly lower.
The November contract for light, sweet crude was off 29 cents at
$39.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange by midmorning.
   Bush said Wednesday that he was dipping into the nation's
reserves of 590 million barrels to counter speculators who have
driven up the price of crude despite adequate supplies. Prices have
doubled since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The president succeeded only temporarily. Prices dropped on
overseas markets Thursday, and crude opened at $37.67 a barrel in
New York. But Persian Gulf developments prompted panic buying.
   William Byers, an oil market analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.,
called news from the Middle East ``more than an offsetting
penalty'' to Bush's announcement.
   He also said many traders viewed Thursday's incident involving
the Iraqi tanker Tadmur as an offensive measure by the Baghdad
government, designed to increase tensions in the Gulf.
   The Pentagon said a team from a U.S. warship in the Red Sea
boarded the tanker after firing warning shots when orders to stop
were ignored. The Tadmur was allowed to proceed after it was found
to be empty, the Pentagon said.
   Analysts said the market continued to be hypersensitive to any
rumors or reports that indicate military action is brewing that
could cut off output from Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   There also was some skepticism in the market about whether Bush
is serious about holding down oil prices by dipping into the
nation's reserves.
   ``It may be more an attempt to show the electorate five weeks
before the elections that he's trying to do something and is
concerned,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil market analyst at Pegasus
Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
   But Beutel said sales from the nation's reserves may yet have an
impact on the market.
   ``Over time, as people start to lose interest in pursuing the
bear market to an end, it could be a moderating influence on
prices,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, prices for refined products also continued to climb
Thursday.
   Home heating oil for delivering in October rose 1.80 cents to
$1.0437 a gallon and prices for wholesale unleaded regular gasoline
jumped 2.59 cents to $1.0269 a gallon.
   The change in seasons is also a factor in heating oil prices,
however. Prices always advance as colder weather approaches.

<TEXT>
   President Bush told the new president of
Bulgaria today that democratic reforms in his country have ``the
full support of the American people.''
   President Zhelyu Zhelev assured Bush, ``This country is no
longer a communist, a totalitarian state.''
   ``We're anxious to see this democratic change solidified,'' Bush
told Zhelev during a brief Oval Office meeting. ``We have great
respect for what you're trying to do. ... The changes in Eastern
Europe have really captured the imagination of the American
people.''
   The Bulgarian leader assured Bush during a photo session before
their meeting that his country ``has embarked fully on the road to
democracy.
   ``This is a symbolic visit because the greatest democracy in the
world is extending a helpful hand to the youngest democracy in the
world,'' he added.
   Zhelev is concluding five days in Washington with his top
economic advisers was heading to meetings at United Nations in New
York and an address to the General Assembly.
   Zhelev said Thursday that Bulgaria is prepared to send a
contingent of ground troops to join forces with the United States
and other countries defending Saudi Arabia and enforcing U.N.
sanctions against Iraq. The plan has been delayed to discuss
minimizing hardship for about 700 Bulgarian specialists in
Iraqi-held territory, he said.
   A group of U.S. economists is working with the Bulgarians on
economic reform proposals for discussion by Bulgaria's first
democratically-chosen parliament in more than 40 years.
   Zhelev said he wants to create a climate for foreign investment,
and favors ``privatizing as widely as possible,'' not only large
industries and agriculture but also private hospitals and schools.
   The president leaves Washington with State Department assurances
of food aid for the winter.
   Zhelev, 55, head of the United Democratic Forces opposition, was
elected president of the Balkan country Aug. 1 after five earlier
unsuccessful attempts in parliament to choose a new chief state.
The body is dominated by members of the former ruling communist
party who have renamed themselves the Socialist Party.

   Italy's film and literary world and hundreds of
fellow Romans paid last respects today to novelist Alberto Moravia,
considered by many critics to have been Italy's leading writer over
the past four decades.
   ``Moravia represented an authoritative Roman presence,'' said
Mayor Franco Carraro at the funeral service held in the
Campidologio Square. ``Without him, Rome will be a different
city.''
   Moravia died Wednesday of a heart attack at his home by the
Tiber River. He was 82.
   Born in Rome, he always lived in the city and set many of his
works such as ``The Woman of Rome'' and ``Two Women'' in and around
the city.
   Other speakers at the funeral included film director Bernardo
Bertolucci and writer Umberto Eco.
   Moravia's friend and fellow writer Enzo Siciliano said, ``He
believed in one thing, in one value: the value of intelligence and
works which through intelligence and knowledge become a patrimony
to everyone.''
   Bertolucci praised Moravia's style, which was readily adaptable
to film due to its detail and imagery.
   ``I only made one film from a work of Moravia's (``The
Conformist'') but I could have made 10. Every time one of his books
came out I had the temptation to make a film,'' he said.
   Moravia is survived by his Spanish wife, Carmen Llera.

   O'Brien was elected to succeed the late Walter Kennedy as NBA
commissioner in 1975, a year when free agency and big money were
reshaping pro sports.
   It was with O'Brien's guidance that the NBA settled the
so-called ``Oscar Robertson suit'' in 1976, which paved the way to
free agency in the league. The NBA and its Players Association also
reached a collective bargaining agreement.
   He also supervised the NBA's merger with the rival American
Basketball Association. As a result, the four strongest teams from
the ABA were absorbed into the NBA. The move ended costly feuding
between the two leagues.
   In 1983, O'Brien and the NBA seemed headed toward a crisis. As
the playoffs approached, so the did the possibility of a players'
strike. O'Brien helped negotiate a new collective bargaining
agreement between the NBA and the Players Association.
   The agreement provided for a cap on how much money teams could
spend on salaries and benefits, in return for which the players
were guaranteed 53 percent of the gross revenues of the league. The
pact, hailed by owners and players as a major step toward securing
the league's stability, was a landmark labor agreement in
professional sports.
   ``It's a tribute to him that a strike was avoided,'' said Julius
Erving, one of the league's best and most respected players.
   In November 1983, O'Brien announced that he had declined a new
five-year contract. ``There comes a time when you have to move
on,'' he said. He left the post the following year.
   ``I think the sport is better off by far than it was in 1975
when he came in, and I think that's the measure of success or
failure in a commissioner,'' said Larry Fleisher, head of the
Players Association and one of O'Brien's chief adversaries.
   O'Brien died at 6 p.m. Thursday, said Myrna Manners, a hospital
spokeswoman.
   He is survived by his wife, Elva Brassard O'Brien; a son,
Lawrence F. O'Brien III of Washington; two grandsons; and a sister,
Mary Placzek of Wilbraham, Mass.
   Funeral services were set for Tuesday in Springfield, Mass.

<TEXT>
   Senior Sudanese army officers have announced their
intention to try to overthrow the military government of Lt. Gen.
Omar el-Bashir.
   In an unusual move, they made the announcement in a news release
Thursday issued in London.
   It identified the officers as Gen. Fathi Ahmed Ali,
commander-in-chief of the Sudanese armed forces; Lt. Gen. Abdel
Rahman Saeed, deputy chief of staff for operations; and Brig. El
Hadi Bushra, acting director general of the Sudan Security Bureau.
   El-Bashir came to power in a 1989 coup, in which he overthrew
Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi.
   The news release said Fatni and his colleagues intend ``to
challenge the ruling junta and lead a military effort against the
present regime in Sudan.''
   ``They called on all officers and soldiers to unite your ranks
and concentrate all your efforts to carry out a concerted operation
... to topple this murderous, corrupt, ugly and failed regime,'' it
added.
   Cairo's El-Wafd newspaper said Fathi had been commander-in-chief
until June 30, the first anniversary of el-Bashir's coup.
   The group said its statement followed consultations with senior
army officers and political parties under the umbrella of the
National Democratic Alliance.
   The whereabouts of the officers who sent the communique was not
known.
   Their statement was accompanied by an announcement of the
formation of the political alliance made up of parties banned in
Sudan shortly after el-Bashir's coup.
   Sudan is plagued by a drought, hunger and a civil war between
the Moslem North and the non-Moslem South. The war and famine have
produced more than 3 million displaced people out of a population
of more than 20 million. More than 380,000 of the Sudanese refugees
have fled to refugee camps in Ethiopia.

   East Germany's Parliament decided today to go
out of business in a blaze of candor by revealing the names of
lawmakers who worked for the Communist secret police.
   Soon afterward, Construction Minister Axel Viehweger resigned
from the Cabinet of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere and admitted
he had contacts to the former secret police under the old regime.
   Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to instruct a commission
investigating the former security apparatus to disclose the names
of former agents it has compiled.
   Before releasing the names, the lawmakers gave officials on the
list a chance to address the allegations before Parliament.
   Viehweger did and promptly resigned. He said he had contacts
with the secret police while he was on the energy council in the
city of Dresden during the former regime.
   Ten other members of de Maiziere's 24-member Cabinet have
stepped down because of political feuds, philosophical differences
or incompetence.
   Other lawmakers trooped to the microphone to describe what they
said were contacts with the secret police that they said were
required under the old regime.
   Eberhard Schiffner, a Christian Democrat, said he was the head
of a state veterinarian practice in 1963 and had to give
information about his practice to the secret police.
   A member of the secret police committee, lawmaker Peter
Hildebrand, said 56 lawmakers or ministers in the current
government were informally employed by the secret police unit,
known as the Stasi.
   The meeting of the 400-member Parliament was the second-to-last
before the nation unites with West Germany on Tuesday and East
Germany's government ceases to exist.
   ``This Parliament must not go down in history as the Stasi
Parliament,'' said lawmaker Marianne Birthler, calling for full
disclosure of information gathered by the committee.
   The nation has been obsessed with how to purge the tens of
thousands of former Stasi informants and agents from influential
roles in politics and business.
   The Stasi, many of whose members held other jobs they used as a
cover, helped keep the former hard-line Communist regime in power
through stifling surveillance, intimidation and purportedly murder.
   Because they and other elite members of the old regime had
access to power, connections and money, they were able to maintain
some control of the nation after a new, inexperienced democratic
government was elected in March.
   There have been reports that many former functionaries and Stasi
agents are running businesses that were once state-owned but have
now been freed to operate as private enterprises.

<TEXT>
   Bolivian anti-drug police and U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents said today they had destroyed one
of South America's most important drug-trafficking networks in a
five-day series of raids.
   The U.S. and Bolivian teams simultaneously hit ranches, labs,
distribution networks, radio transmitting facilities, air strips
and a nightclub, DEA Bolivia chief Don Ferrarone told The
Associated Press.
   He said at least 20 DEA agents and 300 Bolivian anti-drug police
were involved in the operation, which was continuing today.
   The smashed cocaine-trafficking network belonged to Carmelo Meco
Dominguez. Law enforcement agents said the 34-year-old kingpin
handled five to 10 tons of pure cocaine a month, much of it bound
for the U.S. market. They said Dominguez is one of Bolivia's top
three cocaine traffickers.
   Dominguez was arrested Wednesday in Santa Cruz, Bolivia's
second-largest city, located 350 miles east of La Paz, said Raul
Loayza, Bolivia's undersecretary of the interior.
   ``We have destroyed one of the top trafficking operations in
Bolivia and South America,'' Ferrarone said.
   He said Dominguez's ring had provided several tons of cocaine a
month to trafficking organizations in Colombia and Mexico, and had
strong ties to Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels.
   The raids have been concentrated in Bolivia's principal
coca-leaf and cocaine-producing regions, and resulted in
confiscation of property worth at least $10 million, officials
said. The seized assets include an automobile dealership and eight
airplanes.
   The raids began Monday in the Chapare coca leaf-producing
region.
   As the operation got under way, traffickers working for
Dominguez fired at a police and DEA patrol and set two vehicles on
fire. A DEA agent was hurt in the confrontation, in which the
traffickers used automatic weapons, officials said. No further
details were immediately available about the injured agent.
   Bolivia, an impoverished country of 7 million people, grows a
one-third of the coca leaf that after further processing becomes
pure cocaine.
   It is estimated that at least 300,000 Bolivians make their
living from coca-leaf cultivation and cocaine-trafficking
activities.

<TEXT>
   Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski has
declined an invitation by President Bush to visit Washington this
fall, citing his own decision to step down before his term expires,
the White House said today.
   Bush accepted Jaruzelski's decision ``with full understanding,''
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in a written
statement.
   Jaruzelski announced earlier this month in Warsaw that he
planned to resign to pave the way for general elections to choose
his successor.
   ``President Jaruzelski ... did not feel it appropriate to
proceed as planned with his visit to the United States,'' the
statement said.
   Bush looks forward to a visit from Jaruzelski at White House
``in a private capacity at some time in the future,'' the statement
said.
   ``President Jaruzelski deserves great credit for the role he has
played, together with the government of Prime Minister (Tadeusz)
Mazowiecki, in working toward Poland's economic recovery and
democratic consolidation,'' the statement said.

   Health foods contain more pesticide residues than
any other foods tested by the Ministry of Agriculture, the ministry
said Friday.
   In a sampling of food avat 60 percent of
nuts, beans, seeds and legumes contained traces of pesticides.
   About half, or 51 percent, of the dried and semi-dried fruit
contained pesticide traces, it said.
   The health foods sampled were not organically grown and many
were imported, said Ministry of Agriculture spokeswoman, Christine
Jude.
   ``With health foods like nuts, pastas and seeds, they are mainly
non-U.K. produced and in many cases they have quite a long
journey,'' she said. ``They are fumigated to prevent them from
rotting or becoming pest-infected.''
   The lowest level of pesticide residue was found in fresh fruits
and vegetables from regular grocery stores, which showed 20 percent
containing traces of pesticides.
   The pesticide traces found in the health foods were well within
maximum residue levels set by the government, Ms. Jude said. Of
4,000 food samples, 64 percent contained no detectable traces of
pesticides, the ministry said.

<HEAD>Security At Presidential Office Tightened After Stir Involving VP</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police surrounded the presidential
office building today after the media reported the vice president
had threatened to take over as acting president ``by force'' while
his boss is away.
   Vice President Virgilio Godoy, a leading critic of President
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, denied making the statement, which was
carried by two morning newspapers run by the opposition
Sandinistas, and on radio stations.
   ``These supposed statements about going into the Presidential
House by force are not true. That is absurd. How am I going to
enter my own house by force?'' he told The Associated Press today.
``I go to the presidential house when I think it's convenient and I
am going there later today.''
   Since Wednesday, Mrs. Chamorro has been in New York, where she
spoke to the United Nations General Assembly.
   She designated no acting president when she left, a practice she
has followed since taking office April 25.
   In effect, she usually leaves Minister of the Presidency Antonio
Lacayo, her son-in-law and right-hand adviser, in charge.
   Lacayo, who is seen as having shoved Godoy aside, said earlier
this week that Mrs. Chamorro ``is president when she's in or out of
the country.''
   No cars were being allowed to enter the area around the
presidential offices this morning.
   Godoy said the police were on duty to keep Sandinista gangs from
getting in, not to keep him out.
   He accused Sergio Ramirez, who served as vice president under
former President Daniel Ortega, of misquoting comments he made to a
news agency. Ramirez spoke in the National Assembly, the country's
congress, Godoy said.
   The newspaper accounts quoted Godoy as saying he was ready to
become acting president ``by force or however it happens.''
   ``After the president left the country, I am who is governing. I
am president by law,'' newspapers quoted him as saying.
   Godoy, who does not have an office in the presidential office
building, works from his party headquarters because of differences
with Lacayo that date back to the campaign.
   He and a large sector of the National Opposition Union coalition
that supported Mrs. Chamorro in her presidential bid have strongly
criticized her for ``cogoverning with the Sandinistas.''
   They also quoted him as saying he would not respect ``any
agreement'' resulting from talks that began this week between
Ortega and Lacayo to avoid another strike. Ortega, the leader of
the leftist Sandinistas, turned the presidency over to Mrs.
Chamorro after losing Feb. 25 elections.
   U.S. Ambassador Harry Shlaudemann and U.N. officials joined the
talks Thursday night, although no details about their participation
were available.
   Sandinista-led strikes in May and July brought Nicaragua to a
virtual standstill. The Sandinistas have refused to take part in a
national dialogue aimed at reaching a broad consensus on economic
reforms.
   Instead, they have led a series of strikes aimed at stopping
Mrs. Chamorro from returning Nicaragua to a free-market economy.

<HEAD>Energy Agency Studies Tactics to Counter Potential Oil Shortage</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with final communique, no call for
use of emergency reserves. Adds byline</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and 20 other industrialized
nations laid plans today to try to protect the West from a
potential oil supply crisis but said there was no immediate need to
tap strategic reserves to offset the loss of oil from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   The International Energy Agency said that eight weeks after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, oil markets remain adequately supplied
and no product shortages have materialized in member countries.
   After a closed-door meeting, governing board members of the
agency urged in a communique that member countries intensify energy
conservation and efficiency measures.
   They also urged governments to allow the full increase in oil
prices to pass through to the market, and suggested ``flexibility''
in the area of environmental regulations.
   The communique called on all member countries to take ``all
decisions necessary'' in order to be able to act immediately and
effectively if need be.
   If a significant shortfall of oil supplies develops, the board
will convene an emergency session, it said. The governing board
will reconvene sometime during October regardless of whether an
emergency becomes necessary.
   Oil companies were advised to continue drawing on commercial
stocks and to use discretion in purchases to minimize volatility in
the world oil market.
   Echoing the conclusion of the board's Aug. 31 meeting, the
communique said recent oil price rises were driven by ``extreme
political uncertainty,'' not by actual shortages.
   In New York today, oil prices were narrowly lower in quiet early
trading today after briefly topping the $40-a-barrel mark on
Thursday. The November contract for light, sweet crude was off 29
cents at $39.25 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange by mid-morning.
   The agency's members include Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, most Western European countries and the United States,
which this week decided to tap its strategic petroleum reserves for
this first time in response to the Gulf crisis.
   Most official Western oil stocks are held by the United States,
Japan and West Germany. But the energy agency made no call for the
Germans and Japanese to emulate the United States.
   President Bush on Wednesday ordered the sale of 5 million
barrels of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve, which contains 590
million barrels of oil.
   Bush administration officials said the move was a test to see if
the system could work in an emergency. Some U.S. officials have
advocated similar action from West Germany, with 197 million
barrels of reserves, and Japan, with 215 million barrels.
   Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi Arabian oil minister,
and onetime chief OPEC strategist, said high oil prices were due to
the failure of leading oil companies and Western countries to use
reserves.
   ``If oil companies were will to de-stock and draw from their
inventories, we could reduce the price of oil,'' the British
newspaper Financial Times quoted him as saying.
   He said the tapping of strategic reserves by governments would
be ineffective unless oil companies cut stocks.

<HEAD>Doctors About to Remove `Brain Dead' Man's Organs Discover He's
Alive</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - Doctors about to remove the organs of
a man they thought had been killed in a traffic accident knew
something was wrong when his foot twitched.
   Curt Coleman Clark wasn't really dead.
   Clark, 22, was pronounced brain dead Wednesday after he suffered
severe head injuries in a car crash near Granite Falls in central
North Carolina.
   After his family agreed to donate his organs, he was placed on a
respirator and taken by ambulance from Frye Regional Medical Center
in Hickory to Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem, about 150 miles
away.
   Doctors there noticed the man's foot move, said D. Jesse H.
Meredith, a transplant surgeon at the hospital.
   Hospital spokesman Roger F. Rollman said Clark was then taken to
the intensive-care unit where more signs of life were detected. He
was in critical condition Friday, said nursing supervisor Dale
Spaugh.
   Highway Patrol officials said Clark was hurt when he lost
control of his car on a curve and it flipped several times.
   Radiologists who examined him after he arrived at Frye concluded
he was brain dead, said Dennis Phillips, the hospital's executive
director.
   He added that a review turned up no errors in judgment on the
part of the doctors.
   ``I think we have followed the procedure down the line,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia said today
a jailed former interior minister had ordered his assassination in
revenge for the envoy's role in bringing him to justice.
   The former minister, Luis Arce Gomez, is in jail in Miami,
awaiting trial on drug-trafficking charges. Neither his attorney
nor the prosecutor were immediately available for comment on the
ambassador's allegation.
   The ambassador, Robert S. Gelbard, said he believed the former
minister ordered paramilitary forces in Bolivia to kill him
``because I was instrumental, with the cooperation of the Bolivian
government, in getting Luis Arce Gomez to Miami.''
   According to the U.S. Embassy, the information about the
assassination order was provided by high-ranking Bolivian anti-drug
officials, and was being taken very seriously.
   The embassy said Arce Gomez called on members of the neo-Nazi
paramilitary group Lovers of Death, or Novios de la Muerte, to kill
the ambassador. No such attack has been made.
   The group was set up by Arce Gomez in 1979 to help plan and
carry out the bloody July 1980 military coup that interrupted
democratic rule in the country.
   The group was advised by Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, who was
expelled from Bolivia in 1983 and is now serving a life sentence
for war crimes in Lyon, France.
   Arce Gomez became the country's highest-ranking law enforcement
official after the coup. But he provided protection to traffickers,
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration says, and was known as the
``minister of cocaine.'' Arce Gomez was arrested by Bolivian police
and U.S. drug agents on Dec. 10, 1989 and extradited to the United
States by order of President Jaime Paz Zamora.

   Toxic gases leaked at a manufacturing
plant south of here this morning, killing two workers and injuring
six others, authorities said.
   There were no reports of an explosion or fire at the Magnatek
Inc., plant, which produces transformers for florescent lighting.
   The cause of the accident has not been determined, said plant
manager Dennis Kokaisel.
   ``This morning between 5:30 and 6 a.m. a maintenance crew of
eight men were overcome while working on an annealing furnace,'' he
said. Such a furnace is used to temper steel.
   Kokaisel identified the dead workers as John Hosey, 52, the crew
foreman, and Betram Bass, 27. He said three workers were were
admitted to hospoitals for observation while three others were
treated and released.
   Sheriff's dispatcher Diana Smith said she was alerted to the gas
leak about 5:40 a.m., and authorities immediately ordered the plant
evacuated.
   Plant officials said about 100 of the plants estimated 1,400
employees were at the plant when the accident occurred.
   Gary Hall of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said it
appeared the leaking gases ncluded natural gas, liquid nitrogen
and liquid hydrogen, all toxic.
   Kokaisel said he could not confirm what gases were involved but
that the three types mentioned by Hall were used at the facility.
   The body of one of the victims was recovered from the building
shortly after authorities vented the gas from the building. The
other victim died at a hospital.
   Dusty Perkins, another spokesman for the emergency management
agency, said a hazardous materials team was at the plant and
planned to suit up in protective clothing to investigate the
furnace area and determine what gases were involved.
   Hamp Gaston, headmater at Simpson County Academy about 200 yards
from the plant, said the 421-student school would be closed for the
day as a precautionary measure. It was empty at the time of the
accident.
   Mendenhall is a town of 2,500 about 35 miles south of Jackson.
The plant is in a rural area outside of town; no one in the
surrounding area had to be evacuated, authorities said.

<TEXT>
   A benefit concert for abortion rights
candidates featuring Bonnie Raitt, Robin Williams and others was
abruptly canceled after the Veterans Administration said its
theater could not be used.
   The Oct. 4 show, which also was to include singers Rickie Lee
Jones and Melissa Etheridge, was called off by organizers this
week.
   ``When I found out about this, I was completely shocked. I had
to sit down and collect myself,'' Margery Tabankin, executive
director of the Hollywood Women's Committee, said Thursday.
   The group, a political action committee that works on mostly
liberal issues, hoped to raise $200,000 from the invitation-only
concert.
   Tabankin said the committee got permission in July to use the
VA's Wadsworth Theater from the University of California, Los
Angeles, which sublets it.
   She said UCLA allowed the concert because it was to be a private
fund-raiser, not a publicly advertised concert. The tickets were
sold to people on a committee mailing list.
   But VA spokesman Joe Barison said federal guidelines prohibit
partisan political events, public or private, on VA property.
   ``They (UCLA officials) made the commitment. They shouldn't
have, and they acknowledged it,'' Barison said. ``It's just an
honest error anyone could have made.''
   UCLA officials said they were unaware of the concert's purpose
until this week.
   But Tabankin said the committee clearly outlined the nature of
the event. ``We even told them the entire hallway would be filled
with campaign posters,'' she said. ``Our name is the Hollywood
Women's Political Committee. What did they think we are, a canasta
club?''
   The committee had already spent $37,000 on the show, but it
hopes to recoup losses and even make money because many donors were
declining to take refunds. Ticket prices ranged from $100 to
$1,000.

<HEAD>House Passes NASA Bill with Money for Moon, Mars Trips</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed Friday a $44 billion,
three-year spending authorization bill for NASA that includes
President Bush's proposal to place a settlement on the Moon and
begin work on a manned expedition to Mars.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration bill includes
no money for the Moon and Mars program in the next fiscal year but
would spend $444 million to begin it in fiscal 1992 and $649
million in fiscal 1993.
   The bill won approval on a voice vote after a brief debate. It
goes to a conference committee to work out differences with the
Senate.
   The bill provides a three-year spending authorization to enable
NASA to make longer-range plans including space shuttle missions,
space exploration and development of expendable launch vehicles and
an experimental high-speed aerospace plane.
   The House passed a multi-year authorization last year, but the
Senate never took action.
   President Bush proposed last year that NASA establish a
permanent settlement on the Moon and begin a 30-year project to
send a manned expedition to Mars by the year 2019. The bill
authorizes the Bush administration's request for the project's
start.
   The bill authorizes total NASA spending of $14 billion in fiscal
1990, $14.4 billion in fiscal 1992 and $16.1 billion in fiscal
1993. But if added to previous bills, NASA authorized spending
would be almost $17 billion in fiscal 1991 - nearly $2 billion more
than Bush has requested and $4.6 billion more than spent in the
current fiscal year. Separate appropriation bills may provide less
than the authorized amount.

   Sammy Davis Jr. will be honored with a street
named after him in this city where he performed on the club and
theater circuit for more than 40 years.
   City officials plan to rename 31st Street after Davis in
ceremonies on Thursday. For years the South Side street was home to
large numbers of jazz and blues artists.
   ``Legendary artists of the '30s, '40s and '50s were showcased in
clubs and theaters and even private homes that lined 31st Street,
which was once the hub of jazz and blues,'' said Mayor Richard M.
Daley. ``Thus it's only fitting that this street is chosen to honor
one of the greatest performers in show business, the late Sammy
Davis Jr.''
   Davis, who recently died of cancer, first performed in Chicago
in the early 1940s as part of the Will Mastin Trio that included
his uncle and father.
   His last performance in the Windy City was in March 1988 when he
appeared at the Chicago Theater with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis, Possible Loss of U.S. Bases Pose Philippine Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An immediate loss of U.S. bases in the
Philippines would cause tremendous economic harm in a country that
now needs an additional $1 billion to $2 billion as a result of the
Persian Gulf crisis, a top Philippine official said Friday.
   Financial Secretary Jesus Estanislao said President Corazon
Aquino has told him to get involved in talks over the future of
Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four smaller facilities.
The meetings are expected to resume next month in Manila.
   U.S. negotiators have indicated a phaseout or sharp reduction of
the U.S. presence is possible, and Philippine Foreign Secretary
Raul Manglapus has said the country wants an immediate U.S. pullout
from Clark Air Base when the current lease expires nxt September.
   ``The short-term misbenefit to Filipinos for an immediate cutoff
would be tremendous,'' Estanislao said in answer to a question at a
news conference.
   Estanislao said the talks are covering a wide range of
U.S-Philippine issues, including the possibility of debt reduction
in place of some direct payment if U.S. use of the facilities is
continued.
   He said assessments have been made of the impact of a loss of
the bases, but he declined to give figures. He said the figures
were not very precise but the country has contingency plans for the
bases.
   ``Internationalism has advantages and isolation has its costs,''
Estanislao said.
   Members of the U.S. Congress familiar with the negotiations have
said they expect the United States to seek agreement to rent some
key facilities if a phaseout is necessary.
   Estanislao said it is important that the talks conclude
successfully because it would be a ``very bad signal to investors''
if they end with acrimony between the two sides.
   The financial secretary said increasing oil prices have not yet
been fully felt in Manila because the country is still running on
oil purchased prior to Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
   But he said the need for additional funds because of the crisis
is expected to be between $1 billion and $2 billion, depending on
the price of oil.
   ``The challenges for us seem to get bigger by the day, no thanks
to Saddam Hussein,'' he said, referring to the leader of Iraq. The
country also has suffered a major earthquake, drought and massive
flooding in recent weeks.
   The Philippines also is hit by the loss of foreign exchange from
thousands of Filipino workers in Iraq and Kuwait and the need to
give them jobs when they return.
   Estanislao said major economic goals for the country include
giving more assistance to small and medium-sized businesses rather
than larger ``privilege-seeking industries'' and narrowing the gap
between the 6-8 percent interest paid to savers and the 22-30
percent charged to borrowers in by Philippine banks.
   Before the Gulf crisis and recent calamities, the economy was
growing at an annual rate of 6 percent and inflations was below 10
percent a year, Estanislao said.
   He said the country is getting from $2.5 billion to $3 billion
under a multilateral assistance program for 1990 and expects an
increase in 1991. But officials said the money needed as a result
of the Gulf crisis is in addition to those funds which are for
economic development.

   Cuba will build 500,000 bicycles to help curb
effects of a fuel shortage caused by a cutback in oil imports from

Friday.
   The dispatch, monitored in Mexico City, said the first units
would go on the market next year.
   The agency quoted the newspaper Rebel Youth as saying Cuba would
build five factories to make the parts for the bicycles.
   Cuba adopted energy-saving plans a month ago because of cutbacks
in oil from the Soviets, long a major Cuban supplier. Measures
included a 50 percent cutback in fuel reserved for state-owned cars
and a 30 percent cutback for private vehicles.
   The agency said Cuba also might buy bicycles from China.

<HEAD>Disaster Declaration Asked Two Weeks After Toxic Blast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The president of Soviet Kazakhstan asked the
Kremlin on Friday to declare an ecological disaster in part of his
republic following a Sept. 12 explosion at a nuclear fuel factory
released a cloud of toxic gas, Tass reported.
   The blast and fire at the Ulbinsky metallurgical plant in a
workshop using beryllium spewed the toxic gas that affected ``a
considerable part of the population of Ust-Kamenogorsk,'' a city in
eastern Kazakhstan near the border with China and Mongolia, the
official news agency said.
   ``The public of Kazhakstan and population of the city demand
urgent measures to improve the situation and they demand
compensation for damage to their health,'' said a telegram sent by
Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of the republic, to Soviet Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   Nazarbayev also asked that a group of Soviet experts be sent to
Ust-Kamenogorsk to decide on the continued operation of the plant,
and he requested an investigation by independent, international
ecological experts, Tass reported.
   He was quoted as saying in the telegram that local authorities
had already declared the region an ecological disaster zone.
   Several people were injured in the blast. There was no report of
any radiation release.
   The plant is one of the largest producers of fuel for nuclear
power plants in the Soviet Union and is situated in a densely
populated part of Ust-Kamenogorsk, Tass said.
   After the explosion and fire, the toxic gas filled the streets
and dissipated slowly because of calm wind conditions. Preliminary
tests showed twice the permitted levels of beryllium in air and
water samples.
   Beryllium is a very light metal that can catch fire easily and
burn like a magnesium flash, vaporizing and releasing a deadly
smoke of beryllium oxide.
   Ust-Kamenogorsk, a city of about 20,000 people, is located in
the Altai mountains about 100 miles east of Semipalatinsk, where
the Soviet Union conducts its nuclear weapons tests.
   Residents have campaigned against the nuclear tests, and there
have not been any for months.
   Izvestia reported shortly after the blast that officials
involved in the accident were hiding documents to avoid blame.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company, whose plays about
the lives, deaths and treacheries of English monarchs have
intrigued millions, has turned to Gorbachev and glasnost, and it
looks like a flop.
   ``Moscow Gold,'' which opened in London this week with actor
David Calder, a lookalike of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
in the lead role, was mostly panned by the critics.
   The company's productions of Shakespeare history plays like
``Richard II'' are still performed to packed houses, but it is on
shakier ground with one of the biggest real-life dramas of the
twentieth century.
   ``The whole thing is best forgotten, as I'm sure it will be,''
Jack Tinker in The Daily Mail wrote of the play, co-written by
Britons Howard Brenton and Pakistan-born Tariq Ali.
   ``Moscow Gold'' opened Wednesday at the company's Barbican
Theater, where it runs in repertory through Nov. 5. Initial
performances have played to about 60 percent attendance in the
1,162-seat auditorium.
   It's the authors' second collaboration. Last year's ``Iranian
Nights,'' was a response to the death threat against Salman
Rushdie, the Indian-born British writer, for his novel ``The
Satanic Verses.''
   ``We started thinking what else we could collaborate on,'' Ali,
47, said in an interview before the press night. ``One of us said
it would be great to put glasnost and Gorbachev on stage, and we
looked at each other and screamed with laughter, thinking it was
too ambitious an idea.''
   Ali said of ``Moscow Gold'' that ``all the world is in there:
humor, farce, tragedy ... and very, very serious dialogue.''
   The critics largely disagreed.
   Benedict Nightingale in The Times of London called the episodic
three-hour drama ``a pretty flaccid history lesson,'' and faulted
its ``lumpish dialogue.''
   Milton Shulman in The Evening Standard said the play would draw
audiences who want ``instant history served up as sketchy cartoons
or dramatized captions.'' But he admired actor Calder as an
``impressive ... Gorbachev clone.''
   Of the initial reviews, only The Financial Times's Malcolm
Rutherford was enthusiastic. He called the play ``a huge success
... a most unusual triumph,'' praising Calder as ``the very image
of Gorbachev.''
   Directed by Barry Kyle on Stefanos Laziridis's busy,
constructivist sets, ``Moscow Gold'' features a cast of 33 playing
57 characters.
   Sara Kestelman co-stars as Raisa Gorbachev, who is seen in
yellow pajamas and a fur coat singing a ditty about her life as ``a
simple Soviet girl.''
   Later, the couple lie in bed discussing the movie
``Ghostbusters'' and the prospect of a film of their lives, with
Robert Redford and Meryl Streep.
   Alongside the facetiousness is a somewhat didactic history
lesson about the threats to socialism throughout this century.
   Company veterans Clive Merrison, Russell Dixon, and Clifford
Rose play such figures as Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, architect of the
Russian Revolution; Boris Yeltsin, the maverick politician and
former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov.
   Other characters include a chorus of Kremlin cleaning ladies;
Chernobyl Man, a survivor of the 1986 nuclear disaster, and White
House astrologer Rona Anderson, played in drag by American Craig
Pinder.
   Calder, 44, said his resemblance to Gorbachev was ``just a lucky
coincidence.''
   ``This isn't a sort of mechanical imitation,'' he said. ``We're
striving to get the theatricality and the content of Gorbachev's
life, not a sort of correct portrayal of it.''
   To date, the Gorbachevs have not responded to invitations to
attend the production. Ali said Raisa was ``a great fan of the
Royal Shakespeare Company, in any event.''

<HEAD>Milwaukee County Board Approves `Cashless' Welfare Plan</HEAD>

   A voucher system to ensure that welfare
payments are used for housing and other necessities won
overwhelming approval by county supervisors.
   The Milwaukee County program would require direct payment of
housing and utility bills through vouchers, electronic fund
transfers, or third parties for recipients of Aid to Families with
Dependent Children.
   The Board of Supervisors voted 22-2 Thursday to seek state and
federal approval required for the plan to take effect. An amendment
also approved Thursday calls for providing recipients with an
unspecified small amount of discretionary cash.
   ``What we're concerned about in Milwaukee is that the money is
used for what it's intended, which is shelter, gas and
electricity,'' said Supervisor Robert L. Jackson Jr.
   Supervisor Elizabeth Coggs-Jones voted against the proposal.
   ``I haven't supported cashless welfare vouchers because I
believe it's punitive,'' she said. ``Everyone on AFDC is not
mismanaging AFDC money.''
   The board heard evidence that mismanagement of welfare funds has
clogged Milwaukee courts. County Circuit Court Judge Lee Wells said
in a letter to the board that 85 percent of the eviction cases he
hears involve tenants receiving welfare.
   The proposal's sponsor, Supervisor Richard D. Nyklewicz Jr.,
said he wasn't surprised the amendment passed by such a wide
margin.
   ``The Board has traditionally been on record trying to improve
the accountability to the program,'' he said.
   The federal government already permits the use of welfare
benefit vouchers to directly pay vendors like landlords and utility
companies in cases of demonstrated mismanagement by a recipient.
   But Nyklewicz said his proposal would require vouchers in all
welfare cases to ensure welfare benefits are spent only on housing
and essentials.
   ``The advantage of a voucher system to pay landlords directly
for rent is that there should be a dramatic reduction in the number
of eviction cases to be heard every day,'' Wells wrote. ``It would
also ensure a stable home environment for the children of parents
who are receiving AFDC payments.''
   Milwaukee County currently distributes $6.4 million per month in
food stamps and $16.6 million in AFDC benefits, according the
Department of Social Services.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, who has initiated two welfare
experiments, has said he would support the Milwaukee County plan.
   Thompson urged approval in 1987 of Wisconsin's Learnfare
program, which allows the state to cut a welfare family's monthly
benefits if a school reports a teen-age student has been
consistently absent without excuse.
   The Thompson administration also has experimented with a program
called Workfare, which requires welfare recipients to participate
in job training or work part-time to keep their benefits.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed a $1 billion lawsuit
by neighbors of the defunct Rancho Seco nuclear plant, declaring
their radiation exposure was no more dangerous than drinking four
diet sodas in a lifetime.
   The class action suit, filed in October 1985, alleged that the
residents were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation through the
deliberate discharge of contaminated water into a stream.
   But on Thursday, four days before the case was to go to trial,
Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Anthony DeCristoforo Jr.
threw it out.
   He said the 208 plaintiffs were exposed to less than one
millirem of radiation a year. That is the same amount absorbed in
the body by drinking four diet sodas in a lifetime or smoking less
than one cigarette in a lifetime, he said.
   ``This is unbelievable. ...They've dragged us through the
dirt,'' said plaintiff Lynn Davis.
   Morton Friedman, the residents' lawyer, said he would appeal the
decision.
   Sacramento Municipal Utility District officials had maintained
that the level of exposure to residents living within 10 miles of
Rancho Seco was well below the 25 millirem limit set by the federal
government.
   The nuclear plant 30 miles southeast of Sacramento, which opened
in 1975, was closed by a June 1989 ballot measure after a series of
management and operating difficulties.

   The Texas system of electing district judges
at large was upheld today by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
which ruled that judicial elections do not fall under the Voting
Rights Act.
   The ruling rejected arguments by minorities who said that such
at-large voting denies them an equal chance to elect candidates
they want by in effect diluting their votes among a large
population of voters.
   The ruling applied specifically to nine urban counties in Texas,
but was eagerly awaited because of possible broader application. In
Louisiana, a similar challenge to judicial districting is pending,
with a court hearing scheduled this afternoon. A challenge is also
pending in Georgia, which is in a different circuit of the appeals
court.
   A three-judge panel of the appeals court had upheld the at-large
voting system in a 2-1 ruling in May, but brought the case back
before the entire 15-member court for reconsideration.
   The majority opinion, written by Thomas Gibbs Gee of Houston,
said the judge are not representatives of the people.
   ``These offices are not `representative' ones, and their
occupants are not representatives,'' he said. ``Indeed, the state
processes for filling them need not even be elective, as those for
all representative offices presumably must be.''
   Sam D. Johnson of Austin, in a scathing dissent, called the
decision ``a burning scar on the flesh of the Voting Rights Act;
the majority opinion is not simply wrong, it is dangerous.''
   ``No previous court has ever even suggested that judicial
elections might be exempt from the reach of Section 2 of the the
Voting Rights Act,'' he wrote.
   In the majority opinion, Gee wrote that in 1982 Congress passed
a law to test for dilution of voting strength, but stopped short of
imposing such a test for judicial offices.
   ``Should Congress seek to install such a test for judicial
elections, it must say so plainly,'' the court said.
   ``Instead, it has thus far plainly said the contrary.''
   The case was brought to court by the League of United Latin
American Citizens and other miniority groups, who said at-large
voting for state judges prevents them from electing minority
candidates.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton of Midland agreed, ruling that
the system violated the Voting Rights Act. He ordered the state to
divide the nine counties into electoral subdistricts.
   Those counties - Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant, Travis,
Lubbock, Midland, Ector and Jefferson - elect 172 of Texas' 390
district judges, who rule on matters of state law and preside over
trials.
   The three-judge panel of the appeals court reversed Bunton's
decision, saying that Congress did not mean for judicial elections
to fall under the Voting Rights Act.
   In the Louisiana district judge case, U.S. District Judge John
Parker ordered that 11 districts be redesigned to enhance the
chance of electing black judges.
   Only six of Louisiana's 254 district and appellate court judges
are black.
   Also at issue in Louisiana is a state Supreme Court district in
New Orleans, the only district in the state represented by two
justices elected at large.

<HEAD>U.S. Deplores Sudanese Bombing, Says Relief Efforts Threatened</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday the Sudanese
government is threatening an international relief effort by bombing
towns in rebel-held areas where assistance programs are in
operation.
   U.S. Ambassador James Cheek has raised the issue with Sudanese
President Omar el-Bashir but has received no assurance that the
bombing will stop, said deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
   ``These bombings are a threat to the relief effort in Sudan,''
he said.
   ``Relief workers cannot operate if their lives are in jeopardy
from military action,'' Boucher said. ``It is bitterly ironic that
these bombings come at a time when Sudan is undergoing a drought
which will make a massive relief effort necessary next year.''
   The combination of drought and civil war eventually is expected
to put millions of lives at risk in Sudan, according to independent
estimates.
   A Sept. 20 attack on the town of Bor, Boucher said, occurred
while U.N. and international Red Cross relief planes were on the
ground in that town. No relief workers have been injured but the
bombings have caused civilian casualties.
   Boucher deplored the bombings and called on the Sudanese
government to reach agreement on a cease-fire. The war involves
forces loyal to the Moslem-dominated national government against
non-Moslem rebels based in the south.

   Five weeks after Iraq's deadline for
embassies in occupied Kuwait to shut down, diplomats were still
holding out in 15 missions Friday despite meager supplies and
cordons of Iraqi troops outside.
   Spain and South Korea were the latest nations to close their
missions because of unbearable living conditions.
   A Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman in Madrid said Charge
d'Affaires Juan Jose Buitrago left Kuwait on Thursday and was in
Baghdad.
   The South Korean Foreign Ministry announced in Seoul that it had
temporarily closed its embassy due to ``the deteriorated
situation'' there. It said Ambassador Soh Byung-yong and the few
remaining staff arrived in Jordan on Thursday.
   Most embassies have been under siege since Aug. 24, the Iraqi
deadline for foreign missions to close and move to Baghdad. Most
that remain open are those of Western countries, and their water
and electricity have been cut.
   Iraq issued the deadline as a way to tighten control over Kuwait
following the Iraqi invasion on Aug. 2. Iraq later said it had
annexed the occupied land and that embassies that refused to close
would lose their diplomatic immunity.
   Iraq made good on the threat two weeks ago, when its troops
forced their way into the diplomatic compounds of Canada, Belgium,
France and the Netherlands, briefly detaining five Western consuls.
   Western capitals retaliated by expelling Iraqi military attaches
and envoys, and Iraq responded in kind.
   Still, none of the four embassies that reported harassment by
the Iraqi troops in Kuwait has closed.
   Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alessandro Franco said in
Rome that the Iraqis had imposed a total blockade on the Italian
embassy as of Wednesday.
   He said that until then, a clerk had been allowed to take in
water, bread, fresh fruit and other supplies every day for the
ambassador, Marco Colombo, and the second secretary.
   Franco said there were no plans for the two diplomats to leave,
however.
   The British Foreign Office said this week that two of the four
diplomats still in the British Embassy will be withdrawn to
conserve dwindling food supplies.
   A spokesman in London said British Ambassador Michael Weston and
consul Larry Banks will remain.
   Iraqi troops had forced the diplomats to remain indoors for more
than a month, and the swimming pool was being used for washing, he
said on condition of anonymity.
   ``We are determined to keep the embassy open for as long as
possible, in the hope this will offer some tangible assurance to
the British community that remains,'' he said. ``The government
wants to make clear that it does not recognize the annexation of
Kuwait by Iraq.''
   Some of the Britons, like other Westerners who have been banned
from traveling, are being held as human shields at potential
military targets. Many other Westerners still are hiding in Kuwait.
   U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a handful of aides remain
in the U.S. mission. They have boiled swimming pool water to drink
and burned furniture for cooking fuel.
   The Belgian Foreign Ministry said Friday the situation is ``not
physically worse but increasingly more difficult psychologically,''
for its ambassador, his deputy and five other non-diplomatic
Belgians in the embassy.
   The embassies that are still occupied are Bahrain, Belgium,
Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, United Arab Emirates, the United
States and West Germany.

<HEAD>Hiring Freeze in Maryland Causing Cadavers to Stack Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A month-old hiring freeze by the state has
resulted in cadavers stacking up at the state Anatomy Board.
   Ronald S. Wade, the board administrator of the board, is running
the show single-handedly after his embalmer had a heart attack and
his secretary quit.
   Wade, who once had three embalmers working for him, told his
board at an emergency meeting Thursday that processing nearly 800
bodies a year for use by doctors and teaching hospitals cannot be
done by one person.
   ``I personally could not continue in that situation,'' he said.
And as bodies continue to arrive at a rate of 65 a month, ``we
quickly may have a public health problem.''
   If storage space fills to capacity, ``As a cadaver comes in the
door, it will simply be sent to the crematorium,'' said board
chairman Michael N. Sheridan.
   But help may be on the way.
   Sheridan said the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
has agreed to seek an exemption from the hiring freeze so a
secretary and an embalmer can be hired.
   The board's predicament ``is a very real problem,'' said Deputy
Health Secretary Nelson J. Sabatini. ``I told them we would move
the request for exemption through very quickly, and support it. I'm
confident they will get relief.''
   The hiring freeze was imposed by Gov. William Donald Schaefer to
cope with a budget deficit that could reach $270 million.
   The Anatomy Board's members represent the medical schools,
private doctors and hospitals that rely on the agency to provide
cadavers, organs and tissues for training and education.
   The board received 743 bodies last year, up from perhaps 150
when Wade first took over the agency 17 years ago.
   About 250 of the bodies are embalmed for use in anatomy classes
by medical and dental students. Many of the others are the sources
of bones, eyes and other tissues used in transplants and other
medical procedures.

   The only way to review the live rock 'n' roll
show of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles seemed to be with a pair
of Turtle authorities in tow: Matt Raeburn, 9, and Alex Raeburn, 6.
   Their father had to admit that the opening night performance of
the ``Coming Out of Their Shells Tour'' was far better than he had
expected.
   It was imaginative, well produced, technically sophisticated and
surprisingly entertaining. It could serve as a model for what a
kids' first rock concert ought to be.
   The Turtle authorities can speak for themselves. ``It was the
best concert of all time,'' said Matt. Alex, so dazzled that he
couldn't speak until the next morning, pronounced his first concert
``the best thing I've seen yet.''
   The show begins before the curtain goes up. April O'Neill, the
TV reporter who has befriended the Turtles, appears in the audience
broadcasting a live, on-the-scene report of concert preparations.
The report appears on large video screens on either side of the
stage.
   Throughout the show, a camera follows her around the theater and
her reports punctuate the music as a story line unfolds.
   The Turtles - Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo and Donatello -
make their grand entrance from beneath four manhole covers in a
burst of fireworks, and open the show with ``Pizza Power,'' a paean
to their favorite food. ``It has good guitar, a great melody, and
makes me hungry,'' said Matt.
   The next character to appear is Splinter, the Turtles' ninja
master, a human-sized mutant rat who dispenses his philosophy in
epigrammatic phrases reminiscent of Yoda in Star Wars. He sings
``Skipping Stones.''
   ``It's not about stones. It's about the ways of life,'' said
Matt. It is the Turtles' ``most relaxing song, quiet and peaceful
and good to move to,'' he said.
   Roving cameramen follow the Turtles on-stage, transmitting
MTV-like concert footage directly to the video screens beside the
stage in Radio City Music Hall, where the Turtles will perform
until Oct. 7 before beginning a 40-city national tour.
   No appearance of the Turtles would be complete without an
interruption by the evil Shredder, and his foot clan, a troop of
ninja robots.
   Shredder captures April O'Neill, disrupts the Turtles' show, and
otherwise attempts to finally rid the world of the Turtles. Does he
succeed?
   ``You'll have to see it to find out what happens,'' said Matt.
   Based on the comments of the Turtle authorities quoted here, the
show captures whatever it is that fascinates kids about the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles.
   As Matt put it, ``They're really funny guys just trying to save
the world.''

<HEAD>Economic Indicators Show `Nothing but Dark Clouds' Ahead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge plunged 1.2 percent in August, its steepest fall in three
years and an indication, one economist said, of ``nothing but dark
clouds'' ahead.
   Seven of the 11 components of the Commerce Department's Index of
Leading Indicators were off, including stock prices and an index
measuring consumer confidence.
   Orders for new plants and equipment dropped. Unfilled orders to
U.S. manufacturers fell, as did building permits and the money
supply. Weekly unemployment claims were up.
   The report was the first government look into the economic
future since Iraqi occupied Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The only positive contributors were slower business delivery
times, an increase in orders for consumer goods, an increase in the
price of raw materials and a longer workweek.
   But economist Kermit Baker of Cahners Economics in Newton,
Mass., said even the longer workweek might be misleading.
   ``Perhaps it's an indication that industry is trying to get by
with its current workforce rather than hire new people,'' he said.
   Other economists were similarly gloomy.
   ``The decline in the leading indicators provides further proof
that the recession began in August,'' said Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
   ``If we're not in a recession, we're skating close to it,'' said
John Silvia, a financial economist with Kemper Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago.
   Baker was even more blunt.
   ``There's nothing but dark clouds,'' he said, noting that
preliminary economic indicators released this month ``indicate that
the August number was not a one-month phenomenon ... the picture
I'm getting is that this is a long-term trend.''
   The drop in the index, designed to forecast activity six to nine
months ahead, was the sharpest since a 1.4 percent decline in the
month after the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash, when the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plummeted 508 points in one
day.
   Many economists believe Wall Street has now turned bearish again
and is in for a prolonged period of falling prices.
   ``Since the stock market is a forward-looking indicator, the
precipitous decline in stock prices is more tied to expectations of
recession than to the deterioration in corporate earnings witnessed
so far,'' Jasinowski said.
   Silvia said surveys after the '87 crash showed consumer
confidence fell sharply but soon bounced back. Consumer confidence
surveys following the Iraqi invasion also plummeted, he noted,
without signs of improvement.
   Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist with the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said that ``only consumer spending increases will keep
the real GNP (gross national product) from falling in the current
quarter. But, beginning in the fourth quarter, the real GNP will
fall.''
   The general definition of a recession is two consecutive
declines in the GNP - the nation's total output of goods and
services.
   If a recession could be avoided through November, the economic
expansion will have reached its eighth anniversary. It already is
the nation's longest in peacetime.
   The various August changes in the index left it at 144.2 percent
of its 1982 base of 100 and down 0.4 percent over a year ago.

   President Bush promised the exiled leader of
Kuwait today that his country will not remain under Iraqi control.
   ``Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity will be
restored,'' Bush vowed in a departure statement as Sheik Jabir
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the emir of Kuwait, left the White House after a
meeting with Bush.
   Bush said that in their talks he had told the emir, ``that
America's resolve to end this aggression remains ... firm and
undiminished.''
   He also praised the Kuwaiti underground resistance movement that
is fighting the Iraqi invaders dispatched by President Saddam
Hussein.
   ``Your principled, courageous and decisive position in the face
of the Iraqi aggression of Kuwait is a true expression of the
unabated faith and commitment of the American people to the
humanitarian morals on which and for which the United States of
America was founded,'' the emir told Bush.
   Earlier, Bush complimented the emir on his speech Thursday
before the United Nations General Assembly, calling it ``a
marvelous thing.''
   The president said he could not recall anyone getting a standing
ovation, as the emir did, when Bush was United Nation ambassador
from 1971 to 1973.
   ``I thought it showed that the world was strongly supporting
what we all are trying to do,'' Bush told the emir in a photo
session at the start of their meeting.
   The United Nations has passed eight resolutions opposing the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Following their Oval Office meeting, Bush and the emir were
having lunch together. Their top aides were meeting in a Cabinet
room.
   The White House meeting was intended as a clear sign that the
United States still regards the 64-year-old emir as the legitimate
ruler of Kuwait.
   The president has consistently insisted that not only must Iraq
withdraw his invasion troops from Kuwait but that the emir must be
restored to the power he has wielded since 1977.
   ``Those objectives are unchanged,'' Bush told a fund-raising
dinner in Detroit for Rep. Bill Schuette, a Republican senatorial
candidate.
   The emir's Oval Office visit is ``a chance for the president to
talk with him about how it's going, his latest reports from inside
Kuwait,'' said White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   During Bush's two-day political swing through four states, he
helped raise about $4 million for Republican gubernatorial and
Senate candidates and drummed up public support for his Persian
Gulf policies.
   The emir traveled to Washington following a speech Thursday to
the United Nations, where he thanked the international community
for its stance against Iraq's President Saddam Hussein.
   Al-Sabah was warmly greeted by the multinational body. Officials
pointedly referred to him as leader of the ``state of Kuwait'' in
defiance of Iraq's annexation of the oil-rich nation.
   The emir told the U.N. General Assembly that his country was
suffering a crisis that is ``a manifold tragedy whose dire
consequences affect not only Kuwaitis, but other peoples as well.''
   ``In fact, it has jeopardized stability in the world, especially
in the gulf region,'' he said, adding his country now was ruled by
``rape, destruction, terror.''
   Al-Sabah got a standing ovation from the General Assembly, but
the three-member Iraqi delegation walked out as he began speaking.
   The emir voiced hope that ``the withdrawal of the invaders is,
God willing, undoubtedly imminent.''
   Saddam, who sparked an international crisis by sending his
troops into Kuwait on Aug. 2, claims Kuwait is an Iraqi province.
   The two nations have been engaged in a border dispute for a long
time. The United Nations has decried the invasion in a series of
resolutions that include setting up an international blockade to
squeeze Saddam economically by preventing trade.
   The emir fled Dasman Palace in Kuwait during the invasion,
escaping by car just moments before Iraqi troops arrived. His young
brother was killed defending the palace.
   The emir, leader of a huge clan that filled government posts
with about 1,000 princes, now maintains headquarters in exile in
Saudi Arabia.
   As Kuwait's leader, al-Sabah walked a precarious line between
progressive forces at home who wanted democracy and forces next
door in Saudi Arabia who feared democracy might spread and endanger
their conservative, theocratic rule.
   His regime was considered less rigid than Saudi Arabia's. He
allowed a lively - if censored - media, and women in Kuwait were
allowed to drive and vote. His family engendered loyalty by sharing
Kuwait's vast wealth with their countrymen.
   Pro-democracy demonstrations before the Iraqi invasion called
for more power-sharing rather than the emir's ouster.
   Some members of Congress have criticized the U.S. stance toward
the autocratic government, but Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said now is not the time to press for structural changes.

   Carrie Fisher says people think ``Postcards from
the Edge'' is about her relationship with her mother, Debbie
Reynolds, because they can't believe she has an imagination for
language.
   ``Now everyone thinks that my mother and I fight on the
stairs,'' Fisher told Entertainment Weekly in this week's issue.
``I feel bad that people think that my mother is so self-obsessed
that `how are you' never crosses her lips.
   ``She's not like that,'' said the daughter of Reynolds and
crooner Eddie Fisher.
   Fisher, who played Princess Leia in ``Star Wars,'' wrote the
best-selling novel - now a hit movie - in five months after a stay
at a drug center in 1985. It's about an actress re-entering the
Hollywood scene after drug rehabilitation and her glamorous
movie-star mother.
   ``I wrote about a mother-actress and a daughter-actress,'' she
said. ``I'm not shocked that people think it's about me and my
mother. It's easier for them to think I have no imagination for
language, just a tape recorder with endless batteries.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Peter Bogdanovich knows there will be
comparisons between his hit ``The Last Picture Show'' and its
sequel, but he's unfazed.
   He never viewed the 1971 film as great.
   ``I think of it as a good picture we made 20 years ago, nothing
more,'' the director said recently. ``I've never thought of it as a
legendary piece of art and, in fact, I never thought it was quite
right. I always wanted to go back and fix it a bit.''
   ``Texasville'' takes place 30 years later in the same Texas town
featured in ``The Last Picture Show.'' Many in the original cast,
including Cybill Shepherd and Jeff Bridges, are back. Both films
are based on books by Larry McMurtry.

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) - Freddy Heineken, now retired from
making beer, has turned to a career in what people can hear - in
particular, easy listening jazz.
   The 67-year-old Dutch brewery tycoon wrote several of the songs
on ``Dreamscape,'' a compact disc released last week on the Dutch
label Dino, recording company spokesman Jan van Akooy said Friday.
   In a rare interview, published Friday by the International
Herald Tribune, Heineken boasted, ``I fool around with drums and I
have inborn syncopation.''
   Heineken, who controlled a $3.7 billion beer empire until his
retirement last year, added: ``I once played the congas with some
black guys in Jamaica ... They asked me back. They bought me
drinks.''
   Van Akooy described Heineken's recording debut as ``Frank
Sinatra-style music, kind of middle of the road - not real jazz,
but in the jazz corner.''
   Heineken was kidnapped in 1983 with his chauffeur and held to an
$11.6 million ransom. Police freed the two unharmed a few weeks
later and arrested the kidnappers, who got long jail sentences.

   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) - Queen Beatrix and her husband,
Prince Claus, are paying a three-day state visit to France March
4-6, a palace announcement said Friday.
   Beatrix, 52, and 64-year-old Claus are making their trip in
return for President Francois Mitterand's state visit here in 1984,
according to the announcement.
   No program has been announced for the visit, which follows a
less formal French trip by Beatrix in 1986.

   GOP gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams
said Friday he hopes opponent Democrat Ann Richards ``didn't go
back to drinking again.''
   Richards is a recovering alcoholic. Thursday, she claimed she's
just 6 percentage points behind Williams in the gubernatorial race.
   When asked by reporters in San Antonio about Richards' claims,
Williams said, ``I hope she didn't go back to drinking again.''
   Later, Williams clarified the remark.
   ``Well, she's running for governor of Texas, not mayor of San
Francisco. That's a joke. But the 6 percent is way off the mark. I
don't apologize for it,'' he said. Williams didn't explain further.
   A Richards spokesman, Chuck McDonald, said he was stunned,
calling it ``an extremely tasteless comment - even for Williams.''
McDonald called the Republican nominee a ``fraudulent, honking
goose.''
   McDonald also noted that Richards on Thursday announced that it
was her 10th anniversary of sobriety.

<HEAD>DEA: Major Cocaine Trafficking Network Destroyed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of South America's most important
drug- trafficking networks has been destroyed in raids by U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents and Bolivian police, officials
said Friday.
   At least 300 anti-drug police and 20 DEA agents destroyed
cocaine-processing labs and confiscated airplanes, radio
transmission facilities, ranches and mansions, said Don Ferrarone,
DEA chief in Bolivia.
   A U.S. agent was wounded in gunfire during the raids, which
began Monday. Two traffickers were killed and several wounded.
   Police said at least 70 people were arrested, including Carmelo
Meco Dominguez, the reputed head of the smashed drug network.
Dominguez, 34, considered one of Bolivia's top three drug
traffickers, handled five to 10 tons of pure cocaine a month, much
of it bound for the U.S. market, law enforcement agents said.
   ``We have destroyed one of the top trafficking operations in
Bolivia and South America,'' Ferrarone said. He said the network
shipped cocaine to Colombia and to Mexico and had strong ties to
Colombia's Medellin and Cali cartels.
   Among those arrested were pilots, chemists and police and air
force officers who worked for Dominguez's network, police said.
Ferrarone said one of those arrested, automobile dealer Cordoba
Simons, faces cocaine-trafficking charges in Miami.
   ``The capture of all these people is the first step,'' U.S.
Ambassador Robert Gelbard said. ``The hard part is for the Bolivian
government to follow up with the prosecution and conviction of
traffickers. Our experience has been that traffickers escape or are
let out of jail.''
   The raids were concentrated in Bolivia's principal coca-leaf and
cocaine-producing regions, and resulted in confiscation of property
worth at least $10 million, officials said. The seized assets
include Simons' automobile dealership, eight airplanes and a
nightclub with a revolving floor and a $300,000 sound system.
   Raul Loayza, the undersecretary of the interior, said Dominguez
was arrested in Santa Cruz, Bolivia's second-largest city and a
cocaine trafficking center 350 miles east of La Paz.
   As the operation got under way, traffickers working for
Dominguez fired at a police and DEA patrol and set two vehicles on
fire. A DEA agent was slightly wounded in the ankle and arm in the
confrontation, in which the traffickers used automatic weapons,
officials said.
   He was identified as Hawthorne Hope, 35, of Detroit.
   Two traffickers were killed and several wounded in the
confrontation, police said.
   Bolivia, an impoverished country of 7 million people, grows
about one-third of the coca leaf that after further processing
becomes pure cocaine.
   It is estimated that at least 300,000 Bolivians make their
living from coca-leaf cultivation and cocaine-trafficking
activities.

<HEAD>College Board Defers Decision on Sweeping SAT Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trustees of the College Board voted Friday to
postpone for a month a decision on whether to adopt sweeping
changes in the Scholastic Aptitude Test, including possible
addition of a written section.
   Board officials refused to comment on the precise nature of the
changes.
   But documents suggest that a key change might be the addition
for the first time of a written essay section - a change some fear
could work against minority and immigrant groups. The documents
were made available to The Associated Press by FairTest, a
Cambridge, Mass.-based group critical of the SAT.
   The SAT, taken by about a million college bound students
annually, consists of two multiple choice sections, testing verbal
and mathematical skills. The College Board sponsors the exam.
   Other possible changes under discussion include more
problem-solving questions in the math section, and increased
emphasis on critical reading in the verbal section.
   How such questions might be grouped or organized is still being
debated, according to knowledgeable sources who insisted on
anonymity.
   Such changes, if approved, probably would not take effect before
1993, according to previous statements from the Educational Testing
Service, the Princeton, N.J.-based organization that administers
the SAT.
   A brief statement issued by the board following its meeting said
trustees view proposals to revamp the SAT as ``positive and
exciting.
   ``However, because of the importance and complexity of the
issues under consideration, they have requested additional
financial and programmatic information before making a final
decision.''
   The board's statement said it anticipated the issues would be
resolved within the next three or four weeks. That made it likely
that the announcement would coincide with the board's annual
National Forum, scheduled Oct. 31-Nov. 2 in Boston.
   Spokeswoman Janice Gams said College Board president Donald M.
Stewart and other board officials would not elaborate beyond the
statement until a final decision was announced.
   Warren Day, a spokesman for ETS in Princeton, also declined to
comment on the deliberations and referred all questions to the
College Board.
   However, the documents obtained from FairTest suggest that one
factor contributing to the delay were strong objections from
several educators and state legislators who fear that the addition
of a writing section would be unfair to minority students and
recent immigrants.
   In a letter dated Aug. 1 addressed to University of
California-Berkeley President David Gardner, Patrick S. Hayashi,
associate vice chancellor of admissions and enrollment objected to
the proposed new written SAT section. He wrote that the College
Board ``has done an abysmally poor job in examining the possible
effects on non-native speakers.''
   A letter to Stewart from California state Assembly Speaker
Willie L. Brown Jr. also questioned the fairness of giving language
skills added weight.
   ``Doesn't this place recent immigrants and other language
minority students at a competitive disadvantage if the test results
were used as an integral component of admissions reviews?'' he
wrote.
   Questions have been repeatedly raised in recent years by
FairTest and others about alleged racial and cultural bias in SAT
questions. The College Board has consistently denied such charges.

<HEAD>Administration Assures Israel U.S. Would Defend Against Iraqi
Attack</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Bush administration gave assurances Friday
that American troops would defend Israel in the event of an Iraqi
attack.
   ``If Iraq attacks Israel, the U.S. will respond immediately and
forcefully against Iraq,'' a senior State Department official told
reporters after Secretary of State James A. Baker III held talks
with Arab foreign ministers. ``It's that simple.''
   Asked if the U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf area would be used
to defend Israel, the official replied:
   ``The American forces are there. Obviously they are there to
defend against Iraqi aggression. And if that Iraqi aggression
extended against Israel the American forces would react to that.''
   The United States and Israel don't have a mutual defense treaty.
While additional U.S. weapons were sent to Israel in Mideast wars,
all Israeli governments have insisted they don't want American
soldiers fighting Israel's battles.
   Last Sunday, however, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened
to attack Saudi Arabia, other Arab countries and Israel if the
U.S.-led economic boycott of Baghdad strangles his country.
   The blockade of trade with Iraq is designed to force Saddam to
reverse his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We have a commitment to Israeli security that is rock-hard and
unshakable,'' a second State Department official said. ``There is
nothing new in that. It's been there for a long time.
   ``If there is a threat to Israel, that commitment to Israel's
security comes into effect,'' he said.
   The two officials spoke to reporters under rules that shielded
their identity.
   Their statements were so direct that it seemed clear they
reflected the views of Baker, who met with a group of foreign
ministers from the Persian Gulf.
   Baker also met separately with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
Shara and the foreign ministers of Tunisia and Algeria.
   Shara told Baker that Syrian President Hafez Assad found on a
recent trip to Tehran that Iran was steadfast in demanding an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   Assad discussed the plight of the six American hostages held by
pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon with the Iranians but received no
solid information to suggest their freedom was imminent, the U.S.
officials said.

<HEAD>Government Enacts Social Measures After Meeting Sandinistas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Friday it
would lower utility bills for the poor, suspend layoffs for civil
servants and give food to hungry peasants in an apparent effort to
head off a nationwide protest.
   The announcement came after a meeting Thursday with the leftist
Sandinista Front. Sandinista leader and former president Daniel
Ortega said ``there was good will'' to alleviate the hunger and
unemployment that have accompanied government efforts to make
market reforms in the economy.
   But Sandinista labor leaders say a nationwide protest is still
set for Monday.
   ``What we are seeing here is a divorce between two sectors (of
the Sandinista Front) that should be following the same line,''
said Antonio Lacayo, senior aide to President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
   ``We hope that common sense prevails,'' Lacayo told a news
conference at the foreign correspondents' club.
   There were some indications that Ortega's Sandinista Front was
trying to cool pressures for another strike.
   ``I can't say we have solved the problems, I don't want to
create expectations, but there is good will to do so,'' Ortega said
in a radio broadcast Thursday night.
   Lacayo, considered the real power behind Mrs. Chamorro's
government, called Thursday's meeting ``very constructive.''
   The measures include lower utility bills for poor people, free
milk for schoolchildren, free food for peasants affected by bad
crops, temporary work and additional welfare for civil servants who
have been laid off and the creation of a commission to oversee land
distribution.
   He said the government will suspend further spending cuts and
the trimming of the bureaucracy until agreement is reached on how
to fix the economy, beset by inflation and deficit.
   Lacayo declined to say whether the measures were the result of
strike threats. Two Sandinista-led strikes in May and July
virtually paralyzed the country and ended only after major
government concessions.
   ``We are in a very difficult situation,'' Lacayo said. ``It is
categorized by some officials of the World Bank as maybe the most
difficult in the world. It is easily the most difficult in Latin
America.''
   Lacayo said a 10-point Sandinista agenda contained social,
economic and political elements.
   ``Regarding the economic points, especially those of social
import, we are making the effort to see to those sectors
mentioned,'' Lacayo said.
   But on the political points, which asked for presidential
decrees to be rescinded, ``when the Sandinista Front rules again,
through elections, it can issue whatever decress it wants,'' he
said.
   ``We are not going to co-govern'' with the Sandinista Front, he
added.
   Also Friday, Vice President Virgilio Godoy denied news reports
that quoted him as saying he would force his way into the
government complex to prove he is giving the orders, now that Mrs.
Chamorro is out of the country.
   ``This is a refried version by the Sandinista communications
system and its spokesmen to distort and misinform systematically,''
Godoy told The Associated Press.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who is in New York and spoke at the United
Nations on Thursday, has denied office space to Godoy and not left
him in charge the three times she has left the country since taking
power April 25.
   Godoy, a former Sandinista labor minister who became
disillusioned with Ortega's movement, is considered more
conservative than Mrs. Chamorro.
   Police surrounded the presidential complex Friday, but Lacayo
said the cordon ``is a normal thing in these times of protest.''

<TEXT>
   A bill designating ``Paxton soil'' as the
official dirt of Massachusetts has set the dust flying in this
small town, with selectmen convinced the state needs to dig deeper
for noteworthy earth.
   ``We've got clay up to our ears,'' Selectman Thomas J.
Cunningham said Friday. ``It's been this way for years and
everybody knew it and we were very surprised when we heard about
this. We weren't even part of the process.''
   But lawmakers and soil officials said the townsfolk don't
understand the intent of the designation.
   ``It's just a little routine thing that was done to bring
attention to the success of the soil conservation people,'' said
state Rep. Stephen Brewer of Barre, who along with Rep. Kevin
O'Sullivan of Paxton, filed the bill designating the official
Massachusetts soil. Paxton soil was picked because it is the
dominant dirt in the state, he said.
   Officials in Paxton, a small town of about 3,900 in a hilly,
wooded area of central Massachusetts, were surprised when a plaque
commemorating the soil showed up at Town Hall.
   ``We try to be very quiet,'' Cunningham said.
   Selectmen voted Thursday night to send a letter to local
legislators, saying they think the selection was a mistake.
   ``There's areas that don't grow unless you fertilize the living
daylights out of it,'' said Cunningham, adding that he thought
legislators should be more concerned about the state's financial
woes than naming an official soil.
   ``There's so many things to do beside giving that award,'' he
said.
   Paxton Fine Sandy Loam occurs all across Massachusetts, but was
first described in Paxton, hence the name, said William Taylor, a
scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil
Conservation Service in Holden.
   The idea of picking a state soil came up about four years ago,
he said.
   ``It's to bring about the awareness of the soil as a natural
resource,'' he said. Paxton soil is the dominant dirt in the state
and ``I don't think the soil is that bad,'' he said.

   The International Energy Agency advised Western
nations Friday to brace for a possible oil shortage but said there
was no immediate need to tap strategic reserves to offset the loss
of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Echoing the conclusions drawn at a meeting last month, the
group's governing board said in a comunique that rising oil price
rises were driven by ``extreme political uncertainty,'' not short
supplies.
   Supplies lost due to the embargo on Kuwait and Iraq's oil -
imposed after Iraq overran the emirate on Aug. 2 - have been offset
by increased production by other nations, it said, and oil markets
remain adequately supplied.
   However, the board recommended that the 21 member countries take
``all decisions necessary'' so they could act quickly in the event
of a future shortfall.
   The United States this week decided to tap its strategic
petroleum reserves for this first time in response to the Persian
Gulf crisis. President Bush on Wednesday ordered the sale of 5
million barrels of oil from the nation's strategic reserve, which
contains 590 million barrels of oil.
   The Bush administration said its move was a test to see if the
system could work in an emergency.
   But the energy agency made no call for the Germans and Japanese
to follow Washington's lead and use even a symbolic amount of their
reserves.
   Some U.S. officials have advocated similar action by West
Germany, with 197 million barrels of reserves, and Japan, with 215
million barrels. Most official Western oil stocks are held by the
United States, Japan and West Germany.
   If a significant shortage of oil supplies develops, the board
will convene an emergency session on short notice, it said in a
communique.
   The energency agency recommended that member countries intensify
energy conservation and efficiency measures. It also urged
governments to allow the full increase in oil prices to pass
through to the market and suggested ``flexibility'' in the area of
environmental regulations.
   Oil companies were advised to continue drawing on commercial
stocks and use discretion in purchases to minimize volatility in
the world oil market.
   John Easton, assistant U.S. energy secretary for international
affairs, said he was satisfied with the results of the meeting.
   ``I think got what we wanted,'' he said. ``We've cleared the
underbrush and done everything necessary for an effective and
efficient response.''
   The governing board will reconvene sometime during October
regardless of whether an emergency session becomes necessary.
   The agency's members include Japan, Australia, New Zealand,
Canada, most Western European countries and the United States.

   Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan said Friday he
was deeply discouraged by the hostile international response to his
government's Persian Gulf peace efforts and by the widespread
indifference to the economic upheaval the crisis has caused in
Jordan.
   With a mixture of sorrow, bitterness and sarcasm, Hassan spoke
for more than an hour to a gathering of Middle East experts and
reporters assembled by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a research group.
   Hassan defended the efforts of his brother, King Hussein, to try
to reach a peace settlement at a time when the parties to the
dispute are ``remorselessly moving toward a conflict.''
   Given the hardening of positions in recent days, he expressed
wonderment that there wasn't a ``niggling of doubt'' that warfare
was not the ideal answer.
   Hussein has been at the forefront of efforts to find a
diplomatic solution, having visited Baghdad and a number of other
capitals since the crisis erupted eight weeks ago. The Bush
administration has ruled out talks with the Iraqis unless Kuwait is
restored as an independent state.
   The international perception of Jordan's position has been one
of acceptance of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait but Hassan said his
government has implemented U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq
with ``complete loyalty.''
   This policy has been carried out, he said, even though it has
meant a 50 percent decline in the gross national product.
   Hassan chided wealthy countries for not fulfilling their promise
thus far of economic assistance for Jordan to compensate for the
loss of trade with Iraq.
   ``Is it expected that Jordan commit economic hari kari?'' he
asked. ``Are we expected to commit economic suicide?'' The Bush
administration position is that Jordan deserves credit for reducing
economic ties with Iraq but has said it expects total compliance
with the embargo.
   The perception of Hussein's position on the crisis was partly
shaped by his statement shortly after the invasion that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was a ``patriot.''
   In an open letter to Hussein published here this week, the Saudi
ambassador, Prince Bandar, accused the monarch of ignoring
``horrifying acts of rape and destruction (by Iraq) which are
unprecedented in Arab history.''
   Hassan expressed regret that there seemed to be a ``total
blackout on dialogue,'' adding that ``airwave diplomacy'' has
leaders talking at each other instead of to each other.
   The Jordanian prince said he believes more efforts should be
made to work out ``understandings'' concerning the future shape of
a settlement once Iraq complies with the U.N. Security Council
demand for a complete withdrawal of its forces from Kuwait.
   Such understandings presumably would entail territorial and
financial concessions to Iraq in return for an agreement to a troop
pullout from Kuwait.
   Hassan also urged that the principles the Security Council has
applied for a settlement of the gulf crisis should also be applied
to the Arab-Israeli dispute - meaning the return of Israeli-held
territory to Palestinians.
   To ignore that aspect of the overall problem would invite
conflict in that area once the gulf problem is resolved, he said.
   In response to criticism from the State Department and others
about Jordan's decision to host a meeting of Arab radicals two
weeks ago, Hassan said Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
conferring with Syrian officials in Damascus at the very time the
meeting in Amman was being held.
   Syria is on the State Department's list of countries that
allegedly sponsor international terrorism.

   The first sale of federally subsidized public
housing units to its residents was completed on Friday - for $1.
   The transfer of the Kenilworth-Parkside public housing
development in the city's northeast quadrant capped a five-year
process in which the residents successfully managed the complex and
qualified to purchase the property under a program boosted by
Housing Secretary Jack Kemp.
   ``The residents have worked so hard over the past five years to
make this possible. This can open the door for residents of other
public housing complexes across the country who'd like to have a
definite say about their living conditions,'' said Kimi Gray, head
of the Kenilworth-Parkside Resident Management Corp.
   The transfer of 132 housing units to the management corporation
was the first phase of the changeover, with the remaining 332 units
to be exchanged as renovations were completed.
   A study by an independent accounting firm showed the program
would save the government $6 million over 10 years and $26 million
over 40 years.
   The sale was made possible in part by amendments to the 1987
Housing Act, which gave resident councils the right to manage their
own developments.
   The bill, sponsored by then-Rep. Kemp and Del. Walter Fauntroy,
D-D.C., also created procedures allowing residents to buy their
developments after three years of sufficient self-management.
   Kemp said the Kenilworth-Parkside sale helped advance the Bush
administration's goal of achieving a million new first-time and
low-income home owners by 1992.
   ``It creates additional hope and opportunity, because it creates
... more jobs, reduces crime and can help reinvigorate our urban
communities,'' the secretary said in a statement.

   President Bush will meet with Angolan rebel
leader Jonas Savimbi on Tuesday, the White House announced on
Friday.
   The meeting will ``strongly affirm our traditional support for
Savimbi at a time when crucial events are occurring,'' including
food shortages and peace talks, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said in a statement.
   Bush last met with Savimbi a year ago at the White House.

<TEXT>
   A San Diego tuna boat sank in
high seas north of Vancouver Island on Friday, and the Canadian
coast guard said one person was rescued and four crew members were
missing.
   The 69-foot Quicksilver went down shortly after midnight about
200 miles west of the northern tip of the island, said Officer
Dennis Gee of the coast guard's Rescue Coordination Center in
Victoria.
   At the time, the wind was gusting at speeds as high as 55 mph
and waves were 16 to 26 feet, Gee said.
   Rescue efforts were hampered by 15-foot high waves and winds as
high as 40 mph, said Capt. Helen Desnoyers of Air Base Comox on
Vancouver Island.
   Survivor Barry Holberg of San Diego, picked up by another tuna
boat in the area, was alert and conscious, said Lt. Cmdr. Mike
Considine of the Canadian Forces.
   Authorities said he was taken by helicopter to a hospital on
Vancouver Island for treatment of shock and hypothermia.
   They said an empty life raft was discovered two hours after the
distress call was received.
   A Canadian aircraft and three other fishing vessels were on the
scene, and the naval auxiliary vessel Endeavour and coast guard
ship Darby were en route.
   Bill Perkins, president of the San Diego-based Western Boat
Association, said the Quicksilver was a member of his cooperative.
The boat, which left San Diego several months ago, is believed to
be about 20 years old, Perkins said.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices at Farm Drop in September, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products declined 2
percent from August to September, but the overall commodity index
was still 3.5 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department
said Friday.
   Lower prices were reported for corn, hogs, potatoes and cattle.
Those more than offset increases for apples, broilers and eggs, the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary
report.
   Milk prices were at a record high for September, but cattle
prices were down slightly from the all-time record levels of
August. Hog prices were down sharply from August.
   ``The 25-cents-per-bushel drop in the corn price from August to
September was the largest month-to-month decrease since a 28-cent
decline during the same two months in 1986,'' the report said.
   Wheat prices declined 10 cents per bushel in September after a
28-cent decline in August, 29 cents in July and 32 cents in June.
At $2.48 per bushel, wheat prices at the farm were down $1.24 from
a year ago.
   Most prices are mid-September averages that will be revised next
month. For example, the latest report showed August prices declined
0.7 percent instead of the 1.3 percent drop indicated a month ago.
   No new figures were released to show how much farmers pay to
meet expenses. Those are adjusted quarterly.
   The previous adjustment announced in July showed the prices-paid
index was up 0.5 percent from April. A new quarterly figure will be
released in October.
   Meanwhile, department economists say consumer food prices are
going up 5 percent to 7 percent this year, compared with 5.8
percent in 1989, the most since 1981.
   A recent forecast this week put 1990 net cash income of farmers
at a record in the range of $59 billion to $63 billion, up about
one-tenth from last year. The previous high was $57.2 billion in
1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $47 billion to $52
billion, compared with $47 billion last year.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the September price index for
all crops was down 2.4 percent from August and 2.4 percent below a
year earlier. Both wheat and feed grains were down from August,
while soybeans were unchanged.
   The August index for livestock and products was down 0.6 percent
from August, but was 8.1 percent above the year-earlier average.
   ``Compared with August, lower prices for hogs, cattle and calves
in September more than offset higher prices for broilers, eggs and
milk,'' the report said.
   Milk prices rose 10 cents in September to an average of $14.40
per l00 pounds from a revised August average of $14.30 per
hundredweight. That was up 40 cents from September 1989.
   Vegetable prices dropped 5.8 percent from August and were down
1.5 percent from a year earlier. Tomatoes led the September
declines.
   Fruit prices rose 8 percent from August and were up 1.5 percent
from a year ago. Apples led September gain, followed by oranges and
grapefruit.
   The report said:
   -Cattle averaged $75.50 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, down from $76.10 in August but up from $68.20 in
September 1989. Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as
beef.
   -Hogs averaged $52.60 per 100 pounds, down from $55.90 in August
but above the average of $43.40 a year earlier.
   -Corn, at $2.26 a bushel, was down from $2.51 in August and
$2.29 a year earlier.
   -Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $2.48 per bushel, compared with $2.58 in August and $3.72
a year earlier.
   -Rice averaged $6.44 per 100 pounds, compared with $6.64 in
August and $7.59 in September 1989.
   -Soybeans were $6.13 per bushel, unchanged from August but up
from $5.70 a year earlier.
   -Upland cotton was reported at 65.2 cents per pound, compared
with 64.6 in August and 63.9 a year earlier.
   -Eggs were 68.5 cents per dozen, compared with 65.6 in August
and 71.2 in September 1989.
   -Milk was $14.40 per 100 pounds, up from $14.30 in August and
the average of $14 a year ago.
   -Broilers were 35.2 cents per pound, live weight, compared with
33.2 cents in August and 36.1 cents a year earlier.

   Demonstrators outside the Japanese Embassy on
Friday called for a boycott against Japanese products in the wake
of a Tokyo cabinet minister's remark lumping together prostitutes
and American blacks.
   ``No Japanese goods under the Christmas tree in 1990,'' declared
Eugene Jackson, president of Black African Network, to the cheers
of 100 demonstrators. The protest was organized by the NAACP.
   ``Nix Nissan,'' ``Kream Kawasaki,'' ``Sayonara Sony,'' ``Hook
Honda,'' ``Disregard Datsun,'' ``Forget Fujitsu'' and ``Terminate
Toyota'' appeared on placards carried by demonstrators chanting
``Japan No, America Yes.''
   Other placards demanded the resignation of Justice Minister
Seiroku Kajiyama, the minister whose remark triggered a
trans-Pacific furor.
   Kajiyama said prostitutes settling in a neighborhood spoil its
atmosphere, ``like in America when neighborhoods become mixed
because blacks move in, and whites are forced out.''
   The Japanese Embassy said Kajiyama earlier this week apologized
for the remark as ``inappropriate,'' and on Thursday called on U.S.
Ambassador Michael Armacost, reiterated the apology and asked the
ambassador to convey it to the American people.
   Black leaders called the apology inadequate. NAACP Executive
Director Benjamin L. Hooks said he would try to protest personally
to Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu during Kaifu's visit this
weekend. Kaifu and President George Bush were scheduled to meet at
the United Nations.
   Charles R. Sherill of Harvey, Illinois, chairman of the National
Association of Black-Owned Broadcasters, said he would ask the
organization of 225 radio and television stations to pull
Japanese-related programming from the airwaves.
   That would include CBS Records, owned by the Sony Corporation,
he said, adding, ``Our dignity is more important to us than any
black entertainer.''
   ``We're ready to stop listening to Michael Jackson,'' a top
singer on CBS records, said Vernon Goins, president of NAACP Youth
at Georgetown University.
   Pennsylvania state legislator David Richardson read the
gathering a letter to Japanese Ambassador Ryohei Murata, declaring
``it is indeed ironic that black Americans are poised to sacrifice
their lives in the Middle East to protect the world's interests,
including Japan's, at a time when Japanese leaders demonstrate such
unconscionable racist bigotry.''
   The letter was sent in behalf of more than 7,000 black elected
officials of the National Black Caucuses of State Legislators and
local officials and of the National Conference of Black Mayors.

   Republican congressional candidate Al
Beverly said Friday his campaign will be helped by his activation
for duty in the Army Reserves. But he said he didn't accept the
assignment to get an edge on his Democratic opponent, Rep. Buddy
Darden.
   Beverly, the 36-year-old GOP nominee for Darden's seat, said he
has received orders to report for active duty Monday due to the
Persian Gulf crisis. He declined to say where he will be sent or
how long his reserve duty will last.
   ``It is, at this time, something beneficial politically to be
seen in this role. But it isn't something I invented,'' said
Beverly, captain of the 320th Military Intelligence Company
headquartered at Fort Gillem.
   ``They specifically asked that I volunteer for this mission,''
he said. ``They basically made an offer I could not refuse.''
   Earlier this month, at Beverly's request, Darden investigated
and found that Beverly would not have to resign his candidacy if
called to active duty.

<HEAD>Parris: Discrimination Against Majorities Is Worse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Stan Parris says ``it is worse
to discriminate against majorities'' than against minorities and
that he opposes affirmative action hiring plans.
   In a debate against his Democratic opponent, Parris said he
believes in a ``classless, raceless, sexless society.''
   In connection with civil rights legislation, ``The thing we have
to avoid above all else is reverse discrimination'' which results
when laws impose racial hiring quotas, said Parris, R-Va.
   ``It is bad to discriminate against minorities,'' Parris added.
``It is worse to discriminate against majorities.''
   Parris' Democratic rival is Alexandria mayor James Moran, who
said he supports affirmative action hiring programs.
   After the debate, Parris said that when the principle of
discrimination applies ``against majorities in a democracy'' it is
more harmful than discrimination against minorities. Parris
spokesman Mark Strand said later that the congressman's ``principal
stand is that discrimination is wrong.'' The debate was on
Thursday.

<HEAD>GOP Says Dems Used `Enemies List' to Harass Contributors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A complaint filed with the State Elections
Board says Assembly Democrats compiled an ``enemies list'' of
Republican campaign contributors, then used it to harass them in an
effort to dry up support for GOP legislative candidates.
   In the complaint, Assembly Republican Leader David Prosser asked
the Elections Board to investigate his claims that the list was
used to ``threaten, harass and intimidate'' Republican
contributors.
   ``Lobbyists have told me they have been threatened (and) that
their clients have been threatened,'' Prosser said at a news
conference. He did not identify the lobbyists.
   Among those named were Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus, the
Democratic candidate for governor, and a number of other
legislative leaders, including Reps. Barbara Notestein and Walter
Kunicki, both of Milwaukee, the current and immediate past chair of
the Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee.
   ``We don't know anything about it,'' said Michele Carrier, a
Loftus campaign aide. ``Tom hasn't had anything to do with the
committee for months.''
   ``It's absurd,'' Notestein said. ``I think this thing is
laughable. It also shows he (Prosser) is desperate'' in his efforts
to help Republicans win legislative races, she said. The complaint
was filed Thursday.

   Connecticut Party candidate Lowell P.
Weicker Jr. continues to hold a substantial lead in the three-way
race for governor, although his support has dipped, a poll released
Friday indicates.
   A Hartford Courant-Connecticut Poll conducted from Sept. 18 to
25 found Weicker was preferred by 34 percent of respondents,
Republican John G. Rowland by 18 percent and Democrat Bruce A.
Morrison by 15 percent. Thirty-three percent were undecided.
   The poll of 517 people who identified themselves as registered
voters had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points,
so neither Rowland nor Morrison could be said to hold the No. 2
spot.
   The people were selected randomly and interviewed by telephone.
   Weicker had been favored by 41 percent of the voters surveyed in
Courant-Connecticut polls done in May and June.

   The full Senate confirmed the nomination
Friday of Richard Y. Roberts to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Roberts, a former top aide to Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., was
nominated by President Bush last month to fill the last vacancy on
the five-member commission.
   The chairman and the commissioners, all appointed by the
president, serve five-year terms on the commission which regulates
stocks, bonds and the exchanges that trade in them as well as other
financial markets.
   Roberts, 39, graduated in 1973 from Auburn University with an
engineering degree. He received law degrees from the University of
Alabama School of Law in 1976 and George Washington University in
1981.
   He left Shelby's staff in April to join a private law firm.

   After 83 years, the final stone will be placed
atop Washington Cathedral's St. Paul Tower on Saturday, fulfilling
Pierre L'Enfant's vision of a great ``church for national
purposes.''
   President Bush will be on hand, just as President Theodore
Roosevelt was when a foundation stone quarried in Bethlehem was
laid at noon Sept. 29, 1907.
   The church is the seat of the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of
Washington, but also calls itself a ``place of prayer for all
people'' and has often held interdenominational services. Bush is
an Episcopalian.
   The final stone, a 1,000-pound chunk of Indiana limestone carved
in the shape of a folded leaf, will be lifted to its perch on the
cathedral's southwest pinnacle, 234 feet above the ground, by a
giant crane.
   Partly sunny and warm weather is predicted. Jean Grigsby, a
spokeswoman for the cathedral, said at least 10,000 people were
expected, about as many as attended the 1907 ceremony.
   L'Enfant, the French-born architect and engineer hired by George
Washington to lay out the nation's capital, included a nationl
church in his plan. That plan was never fully realized.
   The 873,021-square foot building, roughly 14th century English
Gothic in style, is the sixth largest cathedral in the world.
   St. Peter's in Rome is the largest, followed by one in Seville,
the unfinished St. John the Divine in New York and cathedrals in
Liverpool and Milan.
   Although it is known as Washington National Cathedral, the
official name of the building is the Cathedral Church of St. Peter
and St. Paul.
   Constructionbegan at the east end with the laying of the
foundation stone in what is now Bethlehem Chapel. The twin towers
at the west end, a tenth of a mile away, are named for Sts. Peter
and Paul.
   Work on the cathedral was halted during World War I and World
War II and stopped again in 1977 because of a shortage of funds. It
was resumed in 1980.
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower's funeral was held in the
cathedral. President Woodrow Wilson is buried there. Seven bishops
have presided over it. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev.
Desmond Tutu have spoken from its pulpit.
   The 150,000-ton church was built in the traditional
stone-on-stone method of the medieval cathedral builders, although
with modern equipment. It has no steel reinforcement, but is
supported by flying buttresses.
   It is set on 53 acres on Mount St. Alban, the highest point in
Washington.
   Saturday's ceremony will be followed by a service of
consecration Sunday.
   Provost Charles A. Perry, who played a key role in the
completion of the cathedral, will deliver his final sermon at the
consecration. He is moving on to become president of the Episcopal
Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif.
   As chief administrator of the cathedral, Perry argued at a
crucial point in 1983 that by building on a pay-as-you go basis,
the cathedral could both complete its west towers and expand its
program of outreach to the poor.
   Bishop John T. Walker, who inaugurated the final phase of
construction in 1980, shortly after becoming bishop, died after
heart surgery on Sept. 30, 1989, the day of a service marking the
beginning of the final year of construction. He is buried in the
cathedral crypt.
   His successor, Bishop John T. Haines, will be installed Nov. 15.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sixteen military units will be
disbanded and two air bases closed in troop cutbacks prompted by
lessening tensions and escalating economic woes in South Africa,
officials said Friday.
   President F.W. de Klerk has said defense forces can be reduced
because of declining regional tensions, partly linked to the
government's plan to end apartheid.
   Meanwhile, rising prices and a spreading recession has pressured
officials to cut military spending - yet still leaving South Africa
with the region's most powerful armed forces. Earlier this year,
the navy was cut by 25 percent.
   Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys, head of the armed services, said 11 air
force units and five army units would be disbanded or consolidated.
Two air bases will be closed, he said.
   The Defense Ministry did not say how many troops would be
involved in the cuts or how many would leave the military.
   South Africa has about 95,000 troops, about two-thirds of whom
are conscripts.
   Spending cuts will also mean reductions in training and
exercises, and withdrawal of some weapons and other equipment, the
officials said.
   Geldenhuys said the air forces's Buccaneer jet bombers and
Cessna light trainer aircraft would be withdrawn from service.
Radar coverage will also be reduced, he said.
   The cuts will not reduce the military's offensive capability,
officials said. Neighboring nations have much smaller and weaker
defense forces, according to military analysts.
   Defense Ministry officials declined to confirm a report Friday
in Business Day newspaper that defense spending would be cut by at
least 5 percent, or about $200 million.
   Government officials said the state-run Armscor weapons company
would also be hit by the spending cuts. New projects would be
halted or reduced, and workers will be laid off.
   Armscor has dismissed about 2,000 workers this year. The company
now employs about 20,000 people.
   Armscor was set up by the government to produce weapons and
munitions after the United Nations imposed an embargo on South
Africa to protest the white-run government's apartheid policies.
   The company produces everything from tanks and artillery to
ammunition and has become a major arms exporter.

<HEAD>Sallie Mae Will Take Over Student Loan Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Education Department said Friday it plans
to turn over the $9 billion portfolio of a financially troubled
student-loan guarantee agency to Sallie Mae, the Student Loan
Marketing Association.
   Sallie Mae will handle the portfolio of the Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, or HEAF, one of the largest guarantee
agencies in the Guaranteed Student Loan program, officials said at
a news conference.
   HEAF is in financial difficulty because of a loan portfolio that
included a high percentage of loans to vocational schools whose
students defaulted in large numbers.
   Officials said about $3 billion was in default.
   Under the federal loan program, students borrow from banks and
one of the non-profit guarantee agencies insures the loan. The
government then reinsures the loan.
   In a prepared statement, Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said
an agreement in principle was signed with Sallie Mae for a
three-year wind-down of HEAF's existing portfolio, which will be
managed by a new subsidiary of Sallie Mae.
   Education officials said Sallie Mae would receive a fee of up to
$20 million from the government.
   The United Student Aid Funds also had submitted a proposal to
take over HEAF.

   Leaders of the Afghan resistance will send a
delegation to Moscow at the invitation of the Russian President
Boris Yeltsin to discuss the return of Soviet prisoners in
Afghanistan, state television reported.
   The president of the ``Mujahedeen Transitional Government,''
Sibghatullah Mojadeddi, will name a delegation to travel to the
Soviet capital, Russian Federation lawmaker Iona Andronov told the
news program Vremya.
   The report did not cite a date for the talks.
   At least 300 Soviet soldiers are being held by the Afghan
guerrilla fighters, known as Mujahedeen, according to the Soviet
Defense Ministry, the state news agency Tass reported.
   The Soviet Union ended its 10-year military intervention in
Afghanistan last February, but continues to support the government
of Najib.
   The Afghan resistance has denied holding large numbers of Soviet
military prisoners. But resistance leaders have accused the Soviet
government of moving many Afghan children from their homeland and
keeping them in the Soviet Union against the wishes of their
relatives.

<HEAD>Bush Aide Says U.S. May Push for New U.N. Action Against Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The exiled ruler of Kuwait gave President Bush
a graphic account Friday of the Iraqi occupation of his country
that, according to a Bush aide, could lead the president to push
for tougher U.N. action against Saddam Hussein.
   Asked if the Kuwaiti report would prompt Bush to seek
U.N.-backed military action against Iraq, the president's national
security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, replied, ``That's one of those
things that's conceivable.''
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said it was more likely that a request would come before the United
Nations within a week or so, probably from Kuwait, seeking a
condemnation of Iraq's treatment of Kuwait.
   The official said the United States would support such a
resolution, but does not anticipate it would include military
action.
   ``We're not at that point yet,'' the official said.
   Instead, such a resolution would highlight allegations of
atrocities in Kuwait and recommend action ``that makes Iraq
accountable,'' possibly by demanding future financial reparations
to the Kuwaitis, the source said.
   Sheik Jabir al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the emir of Kuwait, told Bush
that the Iraqis were destroying and looting his country, with
``terrifying conditions'' that include taking patients off life
supports and removing babies from incubators so the equipment could
be shipped back to Iraq, Scowcroft said.
   For his part, Bush said after the meeting that ``Iraqi
aggression has ransacked and pillaged a once-peaceful and secure
country; its population assaulted, incarcerated, intimidated and
even murdered.''
   Bush said Saddam was trying to wipe Kuwait, ``off the face of
the map.''
   Scowcroft, meeting with reporters, said he thought ``this whole
element of what the Iraqis are doing inside Kuwait to a whole
people could conceivably be the subject of another U.N. action.''
   But he said the administration was not actively pursuing that.
   Asked if the emir had asked for a military strike to drive out
Saddam's forces, Scowcroft said:
   ``No, he did not. Not in so many words. You can subliminally
read between the lines if you wish. ... The two had a lengthy
discussion of attitudes, public opinion in the Arab world.''
   Scowcroft would not discuss the prospects for U.S. military
action but did say Bush and the emir had discussed options beyond
the U.N. economic sanctions.
   The adviser described the emir as contending that ``his country
is being destroyed right now and that the longer the situation goes
on the way it is the less there will be of what is recognizable as
Kuwait.''
   Asked how long the United States is willing to wait before
taking other action, Scowcroft said,
   ``It's in everyone's interest to see whether or not there is a
peaceful resolution of this'' by giving the trade embargo a chance
to have an effect, he said.
   But he added, ``There is no question that what's happening
inside Kuwait affects the timetable.''
   The United Nations already has passed eight resolutions
condemning Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and has imposing a
sea and air trade embargo against Iraq.
   Scowcroft, briefing reporters on the meeting, said the
atrocities and destruction inside Kuwait ``really are worthy of
world attention, and a U.N. resolution is one way to bring that
kind of attention on it. This is not just a peaceful occupation.
This is a destruction of a people.''
   He said the emir had described forcible movement of Kuwaitis
from the southern part of the kingdom, with their identification
papers being given to Iraqis and Palestinians being moved in from
the north in ``sort of a repopulation.''
   The emir also described widespread looting, including the
seizure of medical equipment for shipment to Iraq.
   Bush said as the emir left that ``America's resolve to end this
aggression against Kuwait remains firm and undiminished.''
   The emir fled his homeland by car during Saddam's Aug. 2
military invasion, and now maintains his headquarters in Saudi
Arabia.

<HEAD>Dispute Shows Deep Divisions Still in Clean Air Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dispute Friday about how to combat urban
smog exposed the deep divisions that remain between House and
Senate negotiators as they try to craft a compromise clean air bill
in the final weeks of the legislative session.
   ``We have consumed nearly two weeks without making any
progress,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman of the
House-Senate conference. ``We are still miles apart on some
issues.''
   During a meeting that some called ``critical'' to getting a
clean air bill completed before Congress adjourns next month, the
Senate flatly rejected a House proposal for pollution controls on
automobiles and accused the House of stalling because it had taken
11 days to prepare.
   The negotiations, which began July 13 has focused in recent
weeks on what pollution controls to impose on automobiles and
requirements for a limited phase-in of alternative fuel vehicles.
   The issue has been of major importance to Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House delegation. Dingell's state is home
to the major U.S. automakers.
   Senators had complained for days that the House wasn't
responding to a proposal submitted in mid-September. Then, when the
House proposal was received, the Senate quickly rejected it as
being ``so unacceptable that it cannot even serve as a basis of
discussion.''
   Dingell accused the senator of engaging in speechmaking instead
of focusing on the issue.
   ``I feel what's going on is a delay strategy,'' said Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I., suggesting that staunch opponents of the clean air
bill may succeed in blocking it in the final days of Congress.
   Both the House and Senate earlier this year overwhelmingly
approved clean air bills that impose tough new pollution controls
on utilities, factories and automobiles. But efforts to work out
differences in the two bills have made only slow progress.
   Earlier this week, President Bush raised the possibility that
the bill may die if the pace of negotiations isn't quickened.
   Friday's squabble centered on concerns from Senate negotiators
about provisions that would require tougher emission controls on
automobiles and the phase-in of alternative fuel vehicles to reduce
urban smog.
   Baucus, Chafee and other senators called the House proposal a
step backward from the legislation already approved by the House
and Senate. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., in turn accused the
senators of misunderstanding the offer.
   ``I don't think you've looked at this proposal,'' he told
senators.
   At the heart of the sometimes raucous debate was concern - also
expressed by state pollution control officials - that the House
proposal would prevent other states from adopting the strong auto
pollution control measures being taken by California.
   There was also concern that an ambitious program to require the
use of alternative-fuel vehicles by fleet operators and a separate
pilot program for alternative-fuel personal passenger cars were
being weakened.
   However, Waxman contended that states would be allowed to more
easily adopt the California pollution control standards under the
proposal and said the fleet vehicle program would cover more cities
and be stronger.
   But senators remained unconvinced.
   ``I think there's an element of mistrust on each side,'' said
Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Noting the complexity of the massive and highly technical clean
air legislation, he said: ``There aren't 15 people in the whole
city that know what's in here.''
   After about three hours of discussions, Baucus and Dingell
agreed to turn the matter over to staff and schedule another public
conference Tuesday.
   Aside from the motor vehicle section of the bill, the conferees
must still tackle sections dealing with acid rain controls, toxic
chemical emissions from industrial plants, requirements on the use
of cleaner gasoline blends in some urban areas, and whether to
provide assistance to workers who lose their jobs because of
tougher pollution control requirements.

<HEAD>US Announces First Aid to Cambodia in 15 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration signed on Friday
agreements providing $2 million to meet health needs of Cambodian
children. It is the first U.S. government aid earmarked for that
country in 15 years.
   The announcement was a further signal of the improving relations
between the United States and Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed
government and came on the eve of a meeting Saturday between
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Vietnam's Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach.
   The aid funds will be administered by the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Vision Relief and Development.
   The announcement by the U.S. Agency for International
Development said the UNICEF program involves immunizations, oral
rehydration, nutrition and health education.
   The $800,000 grant for World Vision will be used to upgrade a
pediatric hospital in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital.
   U.S. aid to Cambodia was suspended after the communist Khmer
Rouge triumph there in 1975. Congress recently lifted a legal
prohibition on such aid.
   The Bush administration has been expanding diplomatic contacts
with both Hanoi and Phnom Penh out of concern that the Khmer Rouge
rebel group might force its way back into power.
   The Khmer Rouge is widely accused of killing hundreds of
thousands during its 3{-year rule in the 1970's.
   Also Friday, a $9.8 million humanitarian aid agreement was
signed with the president of the Soviet Republic of Armenia.
   It was described as the first A.I.D. program in the Soviet
Union. But the United States provided substantial assistance to
Armenia following the December 1988 earthquake there.

<HEAD>Officials: Medicine Trader Mistook Killer Drug for Cough Syrup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medicine trader who mistook a poisonous
chemical for a cough syrup ingredient is to blame for the deaths of
at least 109 children, government officials said.
   The case also illustrates the widespread problem of fake and
dangerous drugs sold in this West African nation. Such durgs claim
hundreds of lives annually, authorities say.
   Investigators quoted in Lagos newspapers' Saturday editions said
the unidentified trader bought unlabeled drums believed to contain
harmless glycol, but which actually held ethylene glycol, a
poisonous chemical stolen from an oil company's warehouses.
Ethylene glycol causes kidney failure.
   The trader poured the chemical into smaller bottles labeled as
propylene glycol, used commonly in Nigeria as a solvent for the
preparation of cough syrup. The bottles bore the name of a Dutch
company.
   Investigators were trying to determine whether the trader forged
the labels or used old bottles, the newspaper said.
   The trader has been arrested, but the person who sold him the
ethylene glycol was still being sought Friday.
   Forty percent to 50 percent of drugs available in Nigeria are
bogus or substandard, said the United Nations' World Health
Organization representative in Nigeria, S.H. Brewer-Graves, last
April.
   Drugs are sold in licensed and unlicensed stores, as well as by
street hawkers and vendors in market places.
   Under laws passed last year, those convicted of medicine fraud
could face up to one year in prison and a maximum fine of about
$127, a large amount for most Nigerians.

<HEAD>Trial Hinges on Seven Photos, But Attorneys Disagree on Focus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors in the nation's first obscenity
trial of an art gallery and its director said Friday the case
hinges on seven Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, but defense
lawyers said that focus is misplaced.
   ``The state's case is, in some respects, very simple,'' said
prosecutor Frank Prouty. ``The pictures are the state's case ...
The issue is not the First Amendment. The issue is obscenity; the
issue is also displaying pictures of children in the state of
nudity.''
   Prouty said the jury's only duty is to determine the
truthfulness of what the indictments allege - that two of the
photos show children with their genitals exposed and five photos
show homosexual sex acts.
   But attorney Marc Mezibov, who represents the Contemporary Arts
Center, told jurors that there's more to the case.
   ``This is not about photographs. It is about people,'' he said.
   The gallery and its director, Dennis Barrie, are charged with
pandering obscenity and using children in nudity related material,
based on photographs in the 175-photo exhibit, ``Robert
Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.''
   It drew more than 80,000 people during its seven-week
appearance. The Mapplethorpe exhibit closed May 26 and now is on
display in Boston. A grand jury viewed the exhibit April 7 before
returning the indictments.
   If convicted of both charges, Barrie could be sentenced to one
year in jail and fined $2,000. The gallery, which marked its 50th
anniversary last year, could be fined $10,000 for conviction on
both counts.
   ``We don't want any breaks. We don't want any sympathy. We want
a fair shake,'' Mezibov told the jury.
   Opening statements were heard Friday in Hamilton County
Municipal Court after the eight-person jury returned from a brief
tour of the gallery.
   Attorney H. Louis Sirkin, who represents Barrie, previously told
jurors that Mapplethorpe was a homosexual and that some of the
photographs depicted sexually explicit acts.
   ``It was a retrospective ... a biography of an individual by
showing his works,'' Sirkin said. ``This particular photographer
not only did beautiful pictures, he also did some other pictures
that are not so beautiful. But they were pictures of the real world
to him, a world that he was surrounded by and he was a part of.''
   Mapplethorpe died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in
March 1989 at age 42.
   Sirkin said the gallery believed the educational and cultural
value outweighed other considerations in fulfilling its mission to
display contemporary art.
   ``There was controversy, but there was only one intent and
purpose ... to add to the cultural enhancement of the citizens of
this city and this area,'' he said.
   ``It was brought here not to appeal to anyone's prurient
interest. It was brought here to teach and to show ... to show the
world this brilliant photographer and some of the inner makings of
that man and some of the torture that, perhaps, he suffered.''
   The prosecution presented two witnesses, police officers who
testified that they saw the seven photographs on display at the
gallery.
   Testimony will resume Monday and is expected to continue all
next week.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nigerian troops paraded tanks in a show
of force through Monrovia on Friday as the sounds of gunfire
indicated a weeklong cease-fire was in danger of collapse in the
Liberian capital.
   Meanwhile, a Nigerian freighter carrying 150 tons of rice,
canned food and cooking oil was unloaded in port - the first major
food shipment since July to reach a capital where even the most
basic of foodstuffs are in scarce supply.
   About 1,100 West African troops arrived in Monrovia this week
with a new field commander, Nigeria's Brig. Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro.
   Gen. Dogonyaro toured the city in a long motorcade that included
Mohawk tanks and armored personnal carriers. He also met at the
U.S. Embassy with Ambassador Peter de Vos, and called on the
British charge d'affaires, Steven Seaman.
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor had vowed to attack the five-nation
West African task force if it sent reinforcements.
   Military experts and diplomats said cannon fire heard in the
morning appeared to come from Taylor's rebels. It wasn't known who,
if anyone, the guns were leveled upon.
   Taylor, who has declared himself provisional president of
Liberia, announced a unilateral truce Saturday that has been
respected by the opposing rebel army of Prince Johson and by troops
remaining loyal to slain President Samuel Doe.
   Taylor wants to organize elections Oct. 10 to choose a Cabinet
to lead the country - but insists that he must head any government.
Taylor began the 9-month-old civil war when he invaded from Ivory
Coast in December.
   Doe was tortured and slain by Prince Johnson's rebels this
month.
   Taylor's right to the presidency is challenged by Prince Johnson
and by political science professor Amos Sawyer, who was chosen
interim president at a meeting of Liberian exiles Aug. 30 held
under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African
States.
   Under the West African plan, Sawyer would return to organize
elections in which he would not be allowed to be a candidate.
Taylor has refused to let Sawyer return, saying he is a puppet of
the West Africans.
   Sawyer arrived in Sierra Leone on Friday and said he would
return to Monrovia when it was safe to do so.
   Taylor's force has been estimated at as many as 15,000 troops,
but most are untrained teen-agers. The arrival of new West African
forces - boosting the total force to above 4,000 troops - clearly
establishes the five-nation army as the most powerful in the
country.
   The West African army's stated purpose is to put an end to a war
that has claimed more than 5,000 civilian lives.
   About 3,000 West African refugees from Monrovia arrived Friday
in Freetown, Sierra Leone, aboard the Nigerian warship Ambe. The
refugees, who said they had not eaten for three days, told
reporters the war in Liberia was far from over.
   They told stories of brutal killings. ``A few days ago, some
rebels burst into our refugee camp, seized three of our number and
shot them saying, `We just feel like killing a few people,''' one
refugee said. The rebels belonged to Johnson's faction, he said.

   The rebellious republic of Slovenia
edged closer to independence Friday, and Communist-ruled rival
Serbia pushed for more centralized power in a new constitution.
   Slovenia's Parliament passed amendments to the republic's
constitution declaring its laws take precedence over federal ones.
   The communist-dominated Parliament in Serbia, the country's
largest republic, adopted a new constitution that enshrines a
multiparty system but also reasserts direct rule over Kosovo - a
once-autonomous province mainly populated by ethnic Albanians
striving for independence.
   Serbia closed Kosovo's Parliament in July, after it proclaimed
sovereignty. Serb authorities seized control of Albanian-language
media and laid off ethnic Albanians who went on strike to protest
the crackdown.
   The state news agency Tanjug reported Friday that police
arrested an ethnic Albanian journalist for attending an illegal
sssion of the Kosovo Parliament that was held Sept. 7 to declare
the province's sovereignty.
   About 60 ethnic Albanians have been killed in demonstrations
against Serb rule the past 18 months.
   Leaders in Slovenia and Croatia, which like Slovenia ousted
Communists in free elections this year, have criticized Serbia's
action in Kosovo.
   Yugoslavia, created in 1918, is being pulled apart by ethnic and
political differences among its six ethnically diverse republics.
   In Croatia, police used tear gas and clubs Friday to disperse
2,000 Serb demonstrators in Petrinje who had surrounded a police
station and set up roadblocks, Belgrade television reported.
   Tensions in the republic between the Serb minority and the
majority Croats have been exacerbated after a center-right
government was elected this spring.
   In August, the Croatian government declared illegal a Serbian
plebiscite on the autonomy of the Serb minority, comprising some 11
percent of Croatia's population of five million.
   Belgrade television said the Serb demonstrators were protesting
against plans to move weapons belonging to police reservists away
from the town, apparently to prevent Serbs seeking greater autonomy
within the republic from obtaining them.
   The report said similar protests were held in Glina and Obrovac.
It gave no further details.
   Under Serbia's new constitution, political and judicial power
will be centered in Belgrade - the republican and national capital
- formally wresting autonomy from Kosovo and Serbia's second
province, Vojvojdina.
   Neither province was consulted about the new document, despite
relevant provisions in Yugoslavia's 1974 federal constitution.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot,
bowing to pressure from her advisory council, has dismissed a
Cabinet minister accused by the panel of corruption and
incompetence.
   The 19-member Council of State had demanded the ouster of Public
Works Minister Jean-Pierre Moise Pierre-Louis as part of its quest
for fair and non-violent national elections.
   Pierre-Louise will be replaced by Pierre Foucauld, a civil
service engineer, the state-run newspaper L'Union reported Friday.
   The council was created to share power with the presidency
shortly before Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was appointed in March. But
council members claimed she has ignored their advice, and they have
been demanding since August that she resign.
   The council said Pierre-Louise's March 15 appointment was made
without its approval. The advisory panel is supposed to have veto
power over the president's decisions.
   ``Our first report on him revealed he had been dismissed from
the Public Works Ministry for embezzlement,'' council president
Louis Roy said Friday. ``As time went by, our scruples were
vindicated.''
   As acting finance minister from June to August, Pierre-Louis was
constantly under fire for alleged mismanagement of public funds.
   ``Pierre-Louis should not only be fired, he should be brought to
trial,'' said Roy.
   The council also has assailed Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot for failing
to crack down on politically related violence and corruption in the
army. It claims her provisional government has not dealt
effectively with Haiti's grave economic problems.
   The president argues that only an elected government can carry
out the sort of sweeping changes demanded by the council and
others.
   Feuding among the president, the council and the Unity Assembly,
the country's largest political coalition, had threatened to derail
presidential, legislative and municipal elections now set for Dec.
16.
   This week, three major political parties announced they would
campaign in the elections. They previously had refused to take part
in elections under Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's administration.
   Their decision followed a two-day visit to Haiti last week by
former President Carter, who pressed for early elections.
   The last attempt to hold democratic elections in this nation of
6 million resulted in an election day massacre on Nov. 29, 1987,
when army-backed thugs shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters
at polling stations.

   A mechanical problem aboard a submarine delayed
the search Friday for a second piece of a cargo door that tore off
a United Airlines jet last year, a Navy spokeswoman said.
   The submarine Sea Cliff and its support ship returned to Pearl
Harbor on Friday to await the arrival of a part needed to correct
the problem, said Lt. Cmdr. Sandy Stairs, a Pacific Fleet
spokeswoman. She said she didn't know the nature of the problem.
   The submarine recovered half of the door Wednesday in 14,100
feet of water 90 miles south of Honolulu. Its crew thought it also
spotted another piece of the door about 200 yards away.
   The National Transportation Safety Board intends to examine the
door in an effort to learn why it broke off of United Flight 811
over the Pacific Ocean on Feb. 24, 1989.
   Nine people died in the accident.

   In a rare display of guilt from a
disappearing government, East German lawmakers trooped to the
podium of Parliament on Friday and revealed their ties to the
dreaded security arm of the former Communist regime.
   One Cabinet minister resigned after admitting he had contacts
with the notorious secret police, or Stasi, while about a dozen
lawmakers came up to the microphone to deny or explain the
accusations against them.
   The scene was a remarkable display of soul-searching by a
troubled government in the final days of its brief existence.
   The first freely elected Parliament in East German history will
meet one more time before it disbands on Wednesday, when the nation
merges with West Germany. Friday's anguished session lasted 12
hours.
   In one of its last acts, Parliament voted overwhelmingly to ask
a committee investigating the secret police to release the names of
56 officials, three of them ministers and the rest Parliament
members, who were purportedly on the secret police payroll.
  Lawmakers previously had authorized the committee to investigate
individual members of Parliament for ties to the despised police
unit.
   Parliament also voted Friday to ask the committee to divulge the
names of the nine lawmakers in the 400-member Parliament who
refused to authorize the committee to investigate their secret
police records.
   Lawmakers gave those on the list a chance to address the
accusations.
   Construction Minister Axel Viehweger did - he promptly resigned.
He said he had contacts with the secret police while he was on the
energy council in the city of Dresden during the former government,
which was toppled by a popular uprising last year.
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told Parliament that the
investigatory committee informed him Sept. 13 that three of his
ministers had worked for the Stasi. He said one has resigned - an
apparent reference to Viehweger - and two others had taken leaves
of absence.
   A total of 10 members of de Maiziere's 24-member Cabinet have
stepped down since he took office earlier this year. It wasn't
known which he was referring to.
   The lawmakers who described their contacts with the secret
police said such ties were required under the old government. All
denied giving the Stasi information that hurt anyone.
   Eberhard Schiffner, a Christian Democrat, said he was the head
of a state veterinary practice in 1963. He had to give information
about his practice to the secret police, he said.
   He said he was not in a position to immediately detail the
contacts.
   ``I need time, I need access (to his secret police file) and I
need legal advice,'' he said.
   Bernhardt Opitz, a lawmaker from the Free Democrat Party,
dismissed the allegations against him as ``a pack of lies and
inventions.''
   ``The committee plays as judge and jury,'' he said angrily.
   Brigitte Zschoche, a member of the reformed Communist Party,
said she had contact with the secret police - when she was paid a
recruiting visit by the Stasi in 1960.
   Former Research and Technology Minister Frank Terpe, who
resigned last month when his Social Democrat party left the
governing coalition, denied he worked for the secret police.
   Since the fall of the Communist government that ruled for four
decades, the nation has been obsessed with how to purge the tens of
thousands of former Stasi informants and agents from influential
roles in politics and business.
   The Stasi, many of whose members held other jobs they used as a
cover, helped keep the former hard-line government in power through
stifling surveillance, intimidation and - allegedly - murder.
   Because they and other elite members of the old government had
access to power, connections and money, they were able to maintain
some control of the nation after a new, inexperienced democratic
government was elected in March.
   There have been reports that many former functionaries and Stasi
agents are running businesses that were once state-owned but have
now been freed to operate as private enterprises.

   Seventy-four percent of Chicago's inner-city
children have witnessed a slaying, shooting, stabbing or robbery,
according to a study, and experts worry about the impact such
violence has on youngsters' mental health.
   ``People think if they're chronically exposed to this kind of
violence kids adapt to it,'' said Dr. Carl Bell, a psychiatrist at
the University of Illinois School of Medicine. ``But they're wrong.
If children who witness crimes appear withdrawn or silent, it's a
symptom of the damage. They just shut off.''
   The survey of more than 1,000 elementary and high school
children on Chicago's South Side found that of students who
witnessed violent crimes, in about half the cases the victim was a
friend, family member or neighbor. In addition, 46 percent of the
students reported that they had been victims of violent crimes
themselves.
   And the victims aren't receiving the attention and counseling
they need, said Bell, also head of the Community Mental Health
Council, which conducted the survey.
   ``There are basically three areas where people impacted by
witnessing violence show up - in the criminal justice system, in
the mental health system or as a problem with the Board of
Education,'' Bell said.
   He said witnessing or being a victim of violence teaches that
violence is a way to address problems. As a result, the youths
often have difficulty dealing with their own aggression, Bell said.
   ``You also see elements of nihilism,'' he said. ``If you see
people getting killed, you start to think that dying soon is
inevitable. Some kids get chronically depressed, withdrawn.''
   He said officials need to develop a consistent policy on dealing
with the children.
   ``They could develop from that a cadre of professionals able to
deal with homicides and other community violence like shootings or
stabbings,'' Bell said.
   ``That's also true in Detroit,'' said Anne Milko-Delpier,
program coordinator for Detroit's Family Bereavement Center.
``There are not a lot of professionals who are trained to deal with
kids who witness violent crimes like homicides.''
   Milko-Delpier said Detroit's court system refers families of
homicide victims under the age of 21 to the center, a program run
by a nonprofit private social services agency called the Children's
Center.
   She also said she was surprised at the Chicago survey's figures,
adding she believes the number of children witnessing violent
crimes in Detroit is definitely lower, although no study has been
done.
   Officials in Philadelphia also could offer no comparable figures
on children who witness violent crimes. But the number is probably
increasing, said Kemi Adeleye, a director at Families of Murder
Victims, which deals with some of the young witnesses.
   ``Homicide crimes are getting quite common around here,'' said
Adeleye, whose agency is associated with the Philadelphia district
attorney's office. ``But many say they just kind of get used to it.
It's probably not so much that they get used to violent crimes, but
rather it becomes such a frequent thing that they are no longer as
shocked by it.''

<HEAD>Man Awarded City Hall For Delinquent Court Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was awarded City Hall as
compensation for a multimillion-dollar court judgment needs the
money, not the building, his brother said.
   ``We're not interested in actually owning part of East St.
Louis,'' said Richard DeBow, 59, of Bargaintown, N.J. DeBow's
brother, Walter, was awarded the building and 220 acres of
city-owned property Thursday by a circuit court judge in nearby
Belleville.
   ``If the city paid us $1,025,000 tomorrow, we would probably
give it back, but at this point we're looking for a for-sale
sign,'' said the family's attorney, Clyde Kuehn.
   Stunned city officials said they would appeal.
   Walter DeBow, 55, suffered permanent brain damage after being
beaten into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city jail more than
six years ago. He has no short-term memory and is being cared for
at a head-injury rehabilitation center in New Jersey.
   DeBow, who was in court Thursday, was in jail for a traffic
charge of illegal transportation of alcohol at the time of the
beating.
   He won a $3.4 million judgment in 1985. With interest it has
risen to $4 million. Financially strapped East St. Louis still owes
at least $1 million, Kuehn said.
   Judge Roger Scrivner's property award was the only way to
guarantee DeBow would get his money, said Kuehn.
   ``I think this decision is just a major miscarriage of justice
and demonstrates bias against the city of East St. Louis,'' said
City Attorney Eric Vickers.
   The 4-year-old City Hall is worth $10 million, Vickers said, and
city officials had been negotiating with a company to sell the
other property for $5 million to a company that wants to build a
trash recycling plant.
   In the meantime, the city has tried to pay off DeBow's award by
selling $5.2 million in bonds, but Kuehn said they are only worth
$2.8 million.
   DeBow will continue to hold the bonds, however, and collect
payments on them, his lawyer said.
   East St. Louis is saddled with debts estimated at $47 million,
and Gov. James R. Thompson signed a $34 million bailout bill Aug.
30. The money is to come from state bond issues.
   The population of the city, which has one of the highest
homicide rates in the country, fell from 55,000 in 1980 to 40,000
this year, according to Census Bureau estimates.
   ``With all the financial problems we've had, this is just icing
on the cake,'' said City Clerk Alzada Christian Carr.

   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee said Friday he believes the Bush administration ``is
looking more favorably'' toward a war with Iraq before the first of
the year.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said he based his assessment on four
things: The lessening chances of Kuwait regaining its independence
without war; cooler weather in prospect in the Persian Gulf in
coming months; the Moslems' January pilgrimmage to Mecca, which
would make fighting then more difficult; and a more hawkish tone
from the administration.
   He also said he expects Iraq to have biological weapons that
could be used by year's end.
   Aspin spoke at a meeting of a reporters' breakfast group. His
comments were repeated later by his press secretary, Lynn Reddy.
   Pressed by reporters to say war was likely in the eight-week
standoff in the Persian Gulf, Aspin refused to make that
prediction. He did say, however: ``The administration is looking
more favorably on an early war option,'' according to his aide.
   The comments by Aspin came as President Bush's national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said it was possible that the
administration would seek U.N.-backed military action against Iraq
based on a Kuwaiti report of Iraqi destruction of the occupied
country.
   ``That's one of those things that's conceivable,'' Scowcroft
said.
   At the breakfast, Aspin said the economic sanctions against
Iraq, prompted by its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, have been
succeesful in denying money to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   However, Aspin said he does not believe the sanctions will allow
the United States and other nations to achieve the political goal
of forcing Iraq to back down and withdraw from Kuwait.
   The Wisconsin Democrat, one of several lawmakers who met with
Bush and other administration officials last week, also said U.S.
forces deployed to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Desert
Shield will be ready in the next several weeks for any military
action.
   Earlier this week, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he sees an
increasing likelihood that Saddam will lash out with military force
to try to break the stranglehold of the economic embargo.
   Cheney said the administration had forseen that a key point of
danger in the standoff with Saddam would arise once the sanctions
begin crippling the Iraqi economy.
   ``We may have seen in the last 48 or 72 hours the beginning
commentary from him that would indicate that the sanctions are
beginning to bite,'' Cheney said.
   In a speech taped for U.S. viewers, Saddam said U.S. forces
deployed in the gulf region face the prospect of bigger losses than
those suffered by Americans in the Vietnam War.
   ``We may have seen with his threats in the past couple of days
that he may resort to military force in response to the
sanctions,'' Cheney said.

<HEAD>Illinois High Court Rules Children Can't Be Forced to Take Donor
Tests</HEAD>

   The Illinois Supreme Court on Friday upheld a
ruling that 3-year-old twins cannot be forced to be tested as
potential bone-marrow donors for their leukemia-stricken
half-brother.
   The decision upholding a Cook County Circuit Court ruling was
another setback for Tamas Bosze and his son, Jean-Pierre, 12, whom
doctors say might die without a marrow transplant.
   Cook County Circuit Judge Monica Reynolds ruled Sept. 6 that
forcing the twins to take a blood test to determine whether they
could be marrow donors for Jean-Pierre would violate their
constitutional right to privacy.
   Bosze's lawyer, Edward Jordan, said he did not know if Bosze
would appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, his final
recourse. He said the Illinois Supreme Court has not yet released
the reasons for its decision.
   Jordan said the father and son were disappointed but that the
decision was not totally unexpected.
   ``In every case, especially difficult cases, there is as much
chance of losing as there is of winning,'' he said.
   The twins' mother, Nancy Curran, was ``pleased and very
relieved,'' said her lawyer, Beverly Pekala.
   The case moved into the courts in early July after Curran, of
Elk Grove Village, refused Bosze's request to have the twins
tested. She contended the marrow-extraction procedure, which
involves inserting a long needle into the hip bone or breast bone,
would be risky and painful.
   Bosze, of Hoffman Estates, is the father of the twins, but he
and Curran were never married.
   He and his son's mother are incompatible marrow donors for
Jean-Pierre, as is the boy's brother and another half-sister.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal workers are being told to report for
work Monday but to be prepared to go home if there's no agreement
between Congress and the White House on how to pay them.
   The instructions to go to work as usual were contained in a
memorandum from Budget Director Richard Darman to agency heads
Friday.
   In the absence of legislation to keep the government operating
beyond the start of the new fiscal year Monday, non-essential
workers would be sent home within three hours if a government
``phase-down'' is launched, Darman's memo said.
   Federal workers complained earlier about the confusion
surrounding what they should do. Before Darman's memo was released
late in the afternoon, workers were being told to listen to the
radio over the weekend.
   ``This is absolutely no way to run any kind of ship,'' said John
Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American Federation of
Government Employees.
   ``It's just ridiculous that we've always got to operate on the
basis of crisis. People don't know whether they're supposed to go
to work, whether they have a full-time job or what,'' Sturdivant
said.
   About 1.1 million federal workers received notices a month ago
that they might be furloughed up to 22 days if automatic
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction budget cuts kick in on Monday.
   The furloughs and the phase-down are two separate threats facing
federal workers.
   Most of those furloughs probably won't start until later in the
week if no budget accord is reached; The phase-down would occur
Monday if Congress doesn't pass - or President Bush refused to sign
- temporary legislation to keep the government in operation.
   If such legislation were signed but the Gramm-Rudman cuts took
effect, the furloughs probably would not start until later in the
week.
   Also Friday, the federation sued to exempt Social Security
employees from the automatic budget cuts. The suit, filed in U.S.
District Court, contends those 60,000 workers should be excluded
because their salaries are not paid out of general treasury funds.
   Instead, the suit notes, those workers are paid from the Old-Age
and Survivors Insurance Program, which is exempt from the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act that will trigger $85 billion if
no budget agreement is reached.

   A stunt man who has appeared in several major
movies was arrested in connection with a string of armed robberies
that targeted cab drivers, police said.
   Lance Guecia was charged Thursday with eight counts of
first-degree robbery and criminal possession of a weapon for the
crime spree that stretched from June 16 to Wednesday, said Sgt.
Nick Vreeland, a police spokesman. First-degree robbery carries a
five-to-15-year sentence.
   Guecia, 30, allegedly used a knife to rob the drivers. Police
said he also robbed a neighborhood deli twice and was foiled in a
third effort when the owner chased him out with a baseball bat.
   No one was injured in the incidents.
   Vreeland said Guecia told police he was a heroin addict and
needed money for the drug.
   Guecia has worked in such movies as ``Fort Apache: The Bronx,''
starring Paul Newman, ``Legal Eagles,'' with Robert Redford, and
``King of New York,'' the new Christopher Walken film.
   He was arrested Wednesday when a robbery victim spotted him
walking in the Manhattan neighborhood where all of the crimes
occurred, Vreeland said.

<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility
Friday for planting a bomb at an international conference on
terrorism in central London and said its target was a government
minister.
   The bomb was hidden in a plastic lunch box and taped to a
lectern the speakers were to use. The explosive was set to go off
at 10:30 a.m., 30 minutes after the meeting was to begin, police
said.
   ``The ability of the IRA to target British cabinet ministers
while, less than a mile away, British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher holds a crisis meeting to find a way to stop IRA attacks,
demonstrates the daring of the IRA and its ability to strike at
will,'' the IRA said in a statement in Dublin.
   Police defused the bomb after it was discovered by chance by a
sound engineer at Thursday's one-day conference at the Royal
Overseas League in Piccadilly. Police and private security guards
missed the bomb in earlier sweeps.
   Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave was due to address
the conference. Waldegrave is not in the Cabinet but is one of five
deputies to Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   The IRA's statement said an ``active service unit'' had
``succeeded in breaching security to place a bomb at the Royal
Overseas League conference.''
   The IRA statement was issued to a Dublin news agency and signed
with the IRA's traditional nom de guerre, P. O'Neill.
   Mrs. Thatcher was meeting with her Cabinet at her official
residence in Downing Street when the bomb was discovered.
   London's police chief, Sir Peter Imbert, also was scheduled to
address the conference. Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of
Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, said the sophisticated device
contained enough plastic explosives to kill ``the the speaker and
other people as well.''
   Waldegrave was to have been the first speaker, but a change in
his schedule forced a last-minute switch to the afternoon.
   An unidentified IRA spokesman was quoted in a London newspaper
on Saturday as vowing to escalate attacks in mainland Britain in
its fight to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   ``They are rattled and as long as they persist with their
illogical and illegal claim to Ireland, we will not only continue
to rattle them, but will rattle them harder,'' the IRA spokesman
told The Independent newspaper.
   In the Northern Ireland capital, Belfast, police blamed the IRA
for planting four explosive devices packed in radio cassette
holders.
   Two of the devices exploded early Friday in a shop and a
restaurant, causing no injuries. The other two were spotted by
department store clerks and defused, police said.

   Scattered showers and thunderstorms hit Florida and parts of the
central United States on Friday, with flood worries along the Rio
Grande in Texas, but most of the country was clear.
   Rain trailing a cold front moving across the nation fell in
parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Iowa, Indiana and
Michigan.
   Heavy rain that pummeled Florida overnight continued Friday,
with as much as three-quarters of an inch reported between
mid-morning and early afternoon.
   Temperatures warmed into the 80s across much of the south
central and southeastern United States by afternoon. Readings were
only in the 50s and 60s in many central and midwestern states. Most
of the West was in the 60s and 70s.
   A flood warning remained in effect for the Rio Grande from
Presidio, Texas through Big Bend National Park to the mouth of the
Pecos River below Langtry. Thick fog reduced visibility to near
zero in the lower Susquehanna Valley of Pennsylvania, and around
Philadelphia.
   High wind warnings were in effect for parts of Alaska, with
gusts reaching 75 mh reported at Ketchikan Friday morning.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 32 degrees at West
Yellowstone, Mont.

   Four East European countries regarded as
military foes of the West barely a year ago have offered assistance
to the international military force defending Saudi Arabia and
enforcing U.N. sanctions against Iraq, the U.S. State Department
said Friday.
   Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania have offered medical
facilities and Bulgaria said it will provide 400 soldiers, the
department said.
   ``We welcome these offers, which demonstrate the solidarity of
the international community in opposing Iraqi aggression,'' the
statement said. It added that it was up to Saudi Arabia whether to
accept the offers.
   The president of Bulgaria, Zhelyu Zhelev, met President Bush
Friday after earlier telling reporters his country has intended to
contribute ground troops from the outset of the gulf crisis but
delayed out of concern for aggravating the hardships of 700
Bulgarian workers trapped in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   Zhelev said Bulgaria would act soon to dispatch the military
unit, and was making contact with Saudi Arabia through U.S.
officials.
   Czechoslovakia, like Bulgaria, has no diplomatic relations with
Saudi Arabia. Its foreign minister, Jiri Dienstbier, told the
Washington Foreign Affairs Council Friday his country is prepared
to send a team of chemical warfare specialists and a field hospital
to the gulf.
   ``First, we have to be invited,'' he said, adding Czechoslovakia
would welcome it if the U.N. Security Council issued a blanket
invitation to all nations to form a U.N. peacekeeping force.
Dienstbier's aides said the Czechoslovak team could include up to
200 personnel, including doctors, nurses and specialists in
treating injuries caused by poison gas, which Iraq has stockpiled
and in 1988 used against its Kurdish minority.

   The eight were repairing the furnace at Magnatek, Inc. early
Friday when the deadly leaks occurred, said plant manager Dennis
Kokaisel. The furnace is used to harden steel.
   ``What happened is still under investigation and the cause has
not been determined,'' Kokaisel said.
   A. de Jean King Sr., area director of the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, said his investigators were at the scene
but it was too early to pinpoint the source of the leak or the
materials involved.
   Kokaisel identified the dead workers as John Hosey, 52, the crew
foreman, and Bertram Bass, 27.
   He said four other workers were treated at area hospitals and
released. Two were admitted to Simpson General Hospital for
observation, Kokaisel said.
   Authorities said the gases were confined to the plant and no one
outside its boundaries was evacuated. There was no fire or
explosion.
   Nearby Simpson County Academy was closed for the day as a safety
precaution, said headmaster Hamp Gaston. The 421-student school is
located about 200 yards from the plant.
   About 100 of the plant's 1,400 employees were at work at the
time of the accident, said Kokaisel.
   Gary Hall of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said
the leaking gases may have included natural gas, liquid nitrogen
and liquid hydrogen, all toxic.
   Kokaisel said he could not confirm what gases were involved but
added that those three are all used at the plant.

   The Big Apple is going through its autumnal rite
of safeguarding and entertaining the world's potentates and
premiers as they arrive for the U.N. General Assembly.
   Their numbers are swollen this year by the Persian Gulf crisis
and the U.N. World Summit for Children.
   Seventy-one world leaders, including President Bush, are
scheduled to attend the two-day Summit for Children beginning
Saturday.
   It's billed as the largest gathering ever of world leaders.
   On Friday, several of them zipped around the city: President
Patricio Aylwin of Chile speaking at a foreign affairs forum;
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu picking up an honorary degree
at New York University; Queen Fabiola of Belgium visiting the
Covenant House shelter for young runaways.
   Some of the top-ranking officials expected in town are staying
at their country's U.N. missions. For the rest, and their often
large entourages, hotels readied welcomes.
   ``Our Indianapolis 500,'' was the way Jim Mastrangelo, sales
manager of the United Nations Plaza Hotel, described the coming
days.
   But cars at low - or no - speed were what city officials fretted
about.
   ``This will be the largest number of world dignitaries assembled
in New York at one time,'' said city Transportation Commissioner
Lucius Riccio. ``There is the potential for a very large
international gridlock.''
   Many places where the diplomats go, demonstrators are bound to
follow. About a score of protests and rallies pegged to U.N. events
are planned.
   And the city will have its usual complement of unrelated
distractions. For example, a dinner for the Italian foreign
minister is scheduled Saturday night at a trendy downtown
restaurant co-owned by movie star Robert DeNiro.
   But should any dignitary decide to pop into a fast-food joint
for a quick afternoon snack, they could run into the Coalition to
Liberate Animals Worldwide. The coalition intends making things
uncomfortable for meat-eaters at various chain eateries in midtown.
   Another potential for snarled traffic is that motorcades could
meet moviemakers. Three feature films are being shot on the streets
of Manhattan and a fourth in Brooklyn.
   Police plan to set up traffic freezes for no one but President
Bush. He is expected Saturday and will address the United Nations
on Monday.
   A freeze immobilizes everything - vehicles and pedestrians -
along the president's route, and while police say freezes will be
no more than 15 minutes, they have been known to last an hour.
   Shoppers at the swank Bergdorf Goodman for Men witnessed a sweep
Thursday by phalanxes of security men, in advance of a browse by a
foreign bigwig.
   ``They're big shoppers,'' said Elizabeth Maguire, speaking for
the Plaza Hotel, where Suzan Mubarak, wife of the Egyptian
president, and other international guests are staying.
   ``But the rumor is that they've all been clued into Secaucus,''
she added, referring to a bustling discount center across the
Hudson River in New Jersey.
   Police presence in midtown will escalate through the weekend,
with round-the-clock details of as many as 900 officers on duty
Saturday, 950 Sunday and 1,600 Monday.
   Amid the elaborate precautions for the summit on saving the
world's children, a dark counterpoint was the continued
vulnerability of New York City's youth to violence.
   Nine children have been shot in the city since Sunday, the
latest a 13-year-old who died when a gun went off as it was being
passed among his friends. In the last two months, seven children
have died of random gunshots.

   Gen. John T. Chain is
retiring from the Air Force after more than 34 years, most recently
as commander of the Strategic Air Command, the center said Friday.
   Chain, 55, will retire Feb. 1, 1991. The four-star general has
been in charge of the nation's nuclear command center since June
1986.
   The president has nominated Lt. Gen. George L. Butler, 51,
director of strategic plans and poolicy for the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, for promotion to general and to replace Chain, the Pentagon
said.
   The longevity of military service is limited according to grade.
Chain was approaching his limit of 35 years.
   SAC is the country's major nuclear deterrent force, with an
armory of bombers, tankers, reconnaissance aircraft and
intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   Chain, a native of Wilmington, Del., has not disclosed his
retirement plans.

   ``The Civil War,'' the epic, 11-hour documentary
shown over five nights this week, was the most-watched series in
the history of the Public Broadcasting Service, PBS officials said
Friday.
   ``It's been a glorious week for public television,'' said
Jennifer Lawson, PBS vice president for national programming.
   PBS said ``The Civil War'' was seen in about 14 million homes
each evening. Overall, the documentary by filmmaker Ken Burns
averaged a 9.0 rating and a 13 share. Its concluding episode
Thursday night, drew an 8.9 rating and a 14 share, according to
A.C. Nielsen Co. figures.
   A ratings point represents 931,000 television households, and a
share is a percentage of all television sets tuned in to a show in
its time period.
   PBS said it will rebroadcast the series in January and July
1991.

<HEAD>Wall Company Ordered to Pay $5.1 Million in Dupont Plaza Blaze</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIO GHIGLIOTTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Friday ordered a
manufacturer of room partitions to pay $5.1 million in connection
with a 1986 New Year's Eve arson fire that killed 97 hotel guests.
   The U.S. District Court jury found Air Wall Inc. guilty of nine
counts of negligence and 10 counts of failure to warn users about
possible hazards associated with its foam-filled dividers at the
Dupont Plaza Hotel.
   It was not immediately clear what potential hazards were cited
by the jury, which decided the walls contributed to the fast-moving
fire linked to a labor dispute in Puerto Rico's most populous city.
   In a separate trial, three former hotel employees were convicted
of murder in 1987 for setting the fire to pressure management to
give into union demands. The union itself has denied any
responsibility.
   The fire broke out in a ballroom on the first floor of the
22-story hotel and most of the victims were trapped in the casino.
The beachside hotel, which has still not reopened, was filled with
nearly 1,000 guests at the time. Also, 140 people were injured.
   Air Wall was acquitted of 17 other counts, including all 12
counts of productive defectiveness.
   Five other companies that supplied rugs, dressers and foam
cushions used by the hotel were acquitted of all charges following
seven days of jury deliberations to end the 15-month trial.
   Defense attorney Harold Vicente said Air Wall would appeal to
the First Circuit of Appeals in Boston on grounds of confusion
among the jurors.
   ``If the product was not defective, what did we have to warn
about,'' Vicente said following the verdict.
   It was second phase of one of the largest disaster-related
lawsuits in U.S. history.
   The first phase ended in May 1989 when Judge Raymond L. Acosta
accepted a $100 million settlement of hundreds of individual
lawsuits stemming from the Dec. 31, 1986.
   Judge Acosta now must decide whether to go ahead with the third
phase of the trial, which entails suits and countersuits filed by
some of the firms and insurers, or proceed to the remaining 264
individual suits.
   Friday's verdict stemmed from 12 lawsuits filed against hotel
suppliers by survivors and relatives of people killed in the fire.
   Wyoming-based Air Wall manufactured portable Styrofoam-filled
partitions used on the floor of the hotel ballroom.
   The jury determined the four companies that have owned Air Wall
at various times since 1962 must share in paying damages. They are:
White Consolidated Industries Inc., Aircoustic Wall Manufacturing
Co., ACW Airwall Inc. and Hufcor Inc.
   Hector Martinez, a lawyer for the four firms, said the appeal
would be based on jurors' confusion caused by the complicated
nature of the case and the voluminous trial documentation. He said
there were about 15,000 pages of testimony alone.
   ``I think I have a very good argument for appeal and I am very
pleased with the result,'' Vicente agreed.
   He explained that he had expected a much higher damage award.
Originally, the suits filed against his clients totaled $25
million.
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs also said they were satisfied with
the jury award.
   Attorney Francisco Troncoso said the award breaks ground for
settlements in the individual cases are tried.
   Companies cleared by the jury of liability were: Drexel Heritage
Furnishings Industries of North Carolina, Dan River Inc. of
Virginia, Lewis Industries Inc. of California, Foss Manufacturing
Company Inc. of Massaschussetts and Wolf Gordon Inc. of New York.
   Drexel Heritage was the supplier of dressers that were stored in
the ballroom at the time of the fire. Dan River, Wolf Gordo and
Foss supplied rugs used on the walls and floor of the ballroom, and
Lewis Industries was the manufacturer of the foam used to fill sofa
cushions stored in the ballroom.
   The fourth and final phase of the litigation concerns suits
filed by the owners of the hotel against the Teamsters Union.

   Talks broke down Friday evening between
student activists demanding sweeping improvements at the University
of the District Columbia and school and city officials trying to
end a three-day student takeover of university buildings.
   Attorneys representing the students said they were angered by
remarks made by Mayor Marion Barry after emerging from talks with
student leaders.
   The students say they are not receiving a quality education and
have demanded the resignation of most of the school's board of
trustees.
   Barry said negotiations had failed because attorneys for the
students were taking a hard line stance against the university.
   The mayor said he was frustrated by the lack of progress and has
no plans to return to the campus unless the negotiations are
salvaged.
   Charles Pearson, one of the attorneys Barry said was holding up
a resolution, said, ``We will not back down because someone
slanders our integrity. We will not sell the students out.''
   The students said they will not end their protests despite
statements by school officials that they are prepared to resume
regular classes on Monday.
   They vowed to retain control of two campus buildings until a
majority of the school's trustees resign.
   ``For the first time in a long time, the city is going to get a
new administration,'' student protest leader Mark Thompson said.
``There's no reason why the university shouldn't start anew as
well.''
   Thompson and other students met with the 15-member trustee
panel, city council members, and Barry in an attempt to resolve an
impasse that began Wednesday. The students' chief demand is that 11
of the trustees resign.
   Barry and the council approve recommendations for the non-paying
posts, but are powerless to force a trustee to quit.
   ``I support what ... those young people up there want,'' said
city council member Harry Thomas after emerging from a 90-minute
meeting with a group of students. ``I support them 100 percent.''
   The students claim the board has taken a number of actions that
have threatened the quality of education at UDC, a public
institution with an enrollment of about 12,000.
   Students took over a campus building Wednesday, saying they were
upset about several trustee actions, including a plan to spend $1.6
million for renovations to a library so a controversial artwork,
``The Dinner Party,'' can be installed there.
   Students said the money could be better spent in improving
academic programs. Several UDC departments have had problems
maintaining their accreditations.

<HEAD>Attorney Fails to Get Gag Order in Gainesville Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTOW, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for an inmate under
investigation in the slayings of five college students failed to
get a gag order on Friday silencing public suspicion by police,
prosecutors and the news media.
   Stephen Michael Bates, facing burglary and assault charges in a
separate case, has not been charged in the multiple student
slayings in Gainesville, but has been named as a possible suspect.
   ``We don't feel he did it. We feel they're in a position to
clear him or not clear him. They haven't done it,'' said Polk
County Assistant Public Defender Robert Norgard. ``I feel he's just
being used.''
   Circuit Judge J. Tim Strickland rejected the gag order request
but said Norgard was free to file the motion again later.
   ``What we are going to do is see what happens as far as
publicity,'' Norgard said in a telephone interview.
   Bates, 30, is accused of armed burglary, aggravated assault and
battery in Polk County and is being held on $100,500 bond. He
allegedly broke into a woman's home and threatened her and her
daughter with a knife.
   Bates probably will go to trial in January and could face up to
life in prison if convicted, his attorney said.
   ``If you were facing a criminal charge that normally wouldn't
draw any publicity and you were listed as a suspect in the
Gainesville murders, you wouldn't feel too comfortable,'' Norgard
said. ``The mere fact of being mentioned as a suspect is pretty
negative.''
   Gainseville authorities have listed Bates as one of eight
possible suspects in the student killings, but no charges have been
filed.
   The only other suspect identified by investigators is Edward
Lewis Humphrey, 18, jailed in Brevard County on $1 million bail on
unrelated charges stemming from a beating suffered by his
grandmother. His trial is scheduled for early October.
   The nude, mutilated bodies of Sonja Larson, 18, and Christina
Powell, 17, were found in their Gainesville apartment Aug. 26.
Hours later, the decapitated body of Christina Hoyt, 17, was
discovered. The bodies of Manuel Taboada and Tracy Paules, both 23,
were found Aug. 28 in the apartment they shared.
   Several news organizations retained Tampa lawyer Carol LoCicero
to fight any gag order, which she has said would be
unconstitutional prior restraint.

   The chief of staff of a Veterans Administration
hospital on Friday defended the institution's medical care, calling
a critical network television report erroneous and distorted.
   But in Washington, one Ohio senator called for an investigation
and another called for the hospital director's suspension until the
matter is resolved.
   ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' reported Thursday that it used hidden
cameras to record examples of unsanitary conditions and poor
patient care during three days at the Wade Park VA Hospital.
   The hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Murray Altose, blasted the
report as unfair.
   ``I'm saying it isn't substantiated and it's grossly
distorted,'' Altose said. ``It's not the way things are at this
medical center. That picture was a grossly distorted representation
that's full of patently erroneous allegations.''
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said House Veterans Affairs
Committee Chairman G.V. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., has agreed to
investigate the allegations.
   Sen John Glenn, D-Ohio, also called for Veterans Affairs
Secretary Ed Derwinski to investigate, and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, said the hospital's director, Dr. Peter Stajduhar, should
be suspended until the issue is resolved.
   ``PrimeTime Live'' reported that, among other things,
bloodstained needles were not disposed of properly, asbestos was
removed near patient quarters and one paralyzed patient was not fed
for three days.
   Altose said that there are likely to be some failings in the
quality of medical care in any large hospital dealing with
seriously ill patients.
   He also said it was improper to draw conclusions based on the
brief video shown in the report.
   The Cleveland hospital was selected for the investigation
because it was ``a typical representation'' of the care at VA
hospitals, ABC spokeswoman Rena Terracuso said.
   Altose said the allegations would be investigated and a VA
medical inspector would visit the hospital.
   ``We welcome that visit,'' he said. ``We trust that he will look
at, in depth, the goings on in this place and establish clearly, as
we contend, that there is absolutely nothing to hide. There are not
terrible things going on. This is in fact a fine medical center.''

   A gunman who killed a college student in a
hostage standoff apparently stockpiled his weapons legally despite
a history of criminal and mental problems, officials said Friday.
   Mehrdad Dashti was killed Thursday by police after a night of
terror and sexual perversion at a popular student tavern near the
University of California in Berkeley.
   The attack by the heavily armed man prompted calls for tighter
gun control. ``Either this man with a history of being severely
mentally disturbed was able to go in and legally buy a gun, or
someone bought them for him and the gun registration laws aren't
worth the paper they're written on,'' said Berkeley Mayor Loni
Hancock.
   Dashti, 30, shared an apartment with Fred Smith, who described
him as a devout Moslem who kept a 9mm semiautomatic pistol, a
.45-caliber handgun, a .22-caliber pistol and a semiautomatic
rifle.
   Dashti seized control of Henry's Publick House &amp; Grille at the
Durant Hotel, where he held 33 people hostage. Armed with three
pistols and firing intermittently, he wounded several people and
killed UC Berkeley student John Nicholas Sheehy, 22.
   He harangued American women as ``slutty'' and singled out blonde
women for sexual abuse. He forced them to ``drop their pants'' and
directed male hostages to sexually molest them with carrots he
brought with him, said Phil Kim, an architecture student who
escaped early in the siege.
   ``Yes, it happened,'' said a 26-year-old female hostage. ``This
guy came up to me and apologized. I told him not to worry. We kind
of faked it. I think most everyone else did too. It was beyond
horrible.''
   The standoff ended when police stormed the bar and killed
Dashti. Of the nine people Dashti wounded, four remained
hospitalized Friday, listed in good condition.
   The Iranian-born killer emigrated to the United States in the
late 1970s and established permanent residency status by marrying
an American woman in 1984. They divorced in 1987.
   Smith, 19, said the guns worried him at first, but Dashti
assured him he was just a collector and that all were registered.
The roomate said he didn't know about Dashti's mental problems or
criminal record.
   Among Dashti's papers was a county health department document
saying he had been diagnsed as a paranoid schizophrenic and was
limited in his ability ``to think clearly, interact with others
appropriately (and) control (his) impulses.''
   A bottle of the medication stelazine, used for psychotics, was
found in his bathroom.
   Dashti sent registered letters to President Bush, U.S. Supreme
Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist and San Francisco Mayor Art
Agnos, complaining that his brain was being used ``as some kind of
communications device, radiolike, and the messages that are to be
broadcasted out are sent to my mind and sent out from there.''
   The letters to Bush and Rehnquist did not contain specific
threats and Dashti was never investigated by the Secret Service,
said agent Gene Thompson in San Francisco.
   He kept photocopies of those letters and others he wrote to the
local FBI, the head of the federal Department of Health and Human
Services, and ``the authority in charge.''
   According to Alameda County probation officials, Dashti said
``he'd heard the voices of demons'' before he was arrested in 1988
for ramming 48 cars in Berkeley and Albany with his car.
   Dashti was wanted by San Francisco police for investigation of
grand theft and other charges for allegedly trying to withdraw
$16,000 from a bank account authorities said he helped set up last
year with stolen checks. Dashti also was convicted for petty theft
in 1979 and 1983.
   Neither the alleged felonies nor the misdemeanor convictions
would have made it illegal for Dashti to buy guns.
   Similar calls for increased gun controls followed the January
1989 schoolyard massacre in Stockton, but laws passed afterward
affected only assault rifles, not handguns like those wielded by
Dashti.
   ``This terrible tragedy shows that the laws and the system are
failing,'' Hancock said.

   Assailants tossed three grenades into a crowded
cafe, killing the 9-year-old son of a French soldier and injuring
17 other people, including the boy's parents, officials said
Friday.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack
Thursday night in Djibouti, a small African country on the Red Sea
that is used as a staging area for French forces sent to the
Persian Gulf region.
   The cafe is frequented by French military personnel, and there
was speculation the attack could represent a protest against
France's military deployment against Iraq.
   All but two of those injured were French, officials said. The
others were a West German and a Djiboutian, officials said.
   Six people remained hospitalized Friday, including the parents
of the dead boy, according to medical officials.
   French President Francois Mitterrand expressed his ``horror'' at
the ``cowardly attack.''
   The harbor and airport in Djibouti, a former French territory,
serve as support bases for French naval forces. There are 3,850
French troops stationed permanently in the small nation cradled
between Ethiopia and Somalia.
   Interior Minister Khaireh Allaleh Hared said the attack was
carried out by four people. The attackers arrived on foot, threw
three grenades into the crowd on the terrace and left in a stolen
taxi, according to Anne Suard, first secretary at the French
Embassy in Djibouti.
   The taxi was found abandoned about 21 miles southwest of the
capital, Hared said. The owner of the vehicle later was found tied
up in the countryside.
   French soldiers were ordered to return to their base. The French
commander, Gen. Claude Gautier, announced new security measures
would be taken.
   The victim was the son of a soldier identified only as
Sergeant-Major Nervet. Officials of the French army hospital said
Nervet and his wive were in serious condition after being hit by
grenade fragments in the abdomen.
   One of the injured people said the child, seated on his father's
knee, shielded the man from the blast, medical officials said.
   After the attack, an unexploded grenade was found in front of
the terrace of the L'Historil Cafe, about 100 yards away.
   In March 1987, a terrorist attack at L'Historil killed 12
people.

<HEAD>Forest Service Adopts Thomas Plan; Logging May Fall Further</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Forest Service on Friday adopted a plan to
protect the northern spotted owl that Northwest lawmakers said will
cause greater cuts in logging than the White House predicted last
week.
   The service said it will follow guidelines put forth by Forest
Service biologist Jack Ward Thomas in April. At that time, the
service estimated the Thomas plan would cause Northwest federal
timber harvests to fall by nearly 50 percent and result in the loss
of more than 20,000 jobs.
   President Bush backed a White House task force last week that
said the owl could be saved from extinction by reducing next year's
harvests by only about 20 percent - from this year's 3.85 billion
board feet to about 3 billion board feet.
   Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., a backer of the timber industry and
critic of Thomas, said the new announcement on Friday means
harvests will tumble to about 2.6 billion board feet.
   ``While the task force might have come forward saying we will
cut 3.2 billion board feet, this means we have just accepted 2.6
billion. This is just a further cave-in to the folks that are
trying to put us out of business,'' Smith said.
   The action came as environmentalists were preparing to return to
federal court in Seattle to try to force the federal agency to
accept a scientifically sound plan to protect the owl's habitat in
the Northwest's old-growth forests.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service declared the rare owl a threatened
species under the Endangered Species Act on June 22. Lawmakers said
the Thomas proposal would be the most sweeping protection of
wildlife in the history of the act, banning logging on 3 million
acres of national forests currently open to harvests - an area
larger than the state of Maryland.

<TEXT>
   The Oregon Supreme Court on Friday restored
five voter initiative measures to the Nov. 6 ballot, reversing a
ruling that had disqualified them on a technicality.
   The state high court announced its unanimous decision after
hearing arguments on the appeal. The court had no further comment,
saying written opinions would be issued at a later date.
   One of the five issues put back on the ballot would allow tax
credits for partent who sent their children to parochial schools.
   Marion County Circuit Judge Richard Barber ruled Monday that the
five initiatives were not eligible for the ballot because they
lacked financial statements. The statements weren't included
because of an earlier court rulings saying state officials missed a
deadline for formally approving them.
   State law requires that financial estimates be printed on
ballots and in the state Voter's Pamphlet for measures having a
substantial impact on the state treasury.
   Other measures affected by the high court ruling would limit
property taxes, shut down the Trojan nuclear plant until waste
disposal requirements are met, ban some non-recyclable packaging,
and set up a pilot work program for welfare applicants.
   In a secondary ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the earlier
court decisions that had struck financial impact statements from
three measures on grounds officials missed a deadline for approving
them.
   Lawyers for backers of some measures told the Supreme Court the
public's initiative rights shouldn't be breached because of
procedural mistakes by the government.
   Mike Reynolds, an assistant attorney general, said the fiscal
statement law is ambiguous and should be construed ``so as not to
abort the right of initiative.''
   But Robert Durham, a lawyer for foes of the tax measures, said
voters have a ``material right'' to have financial statements. The
measures his clients oppose have ``potentially catastrophic,
multi-billion dollar impacts,'' he said.
   Elections officials have said the fiscal statements might be
posted in voting booths as a substitute for having them on the
ballot or in the Voters' Pamphlet.

<TEXT>
   The military government Friday dismissed
as exaggerations reports about international reaction to detentions
and interrogations of Burmese staff at some foreign embassies.
   A Foreign Ministry statement broadcast on state radio and
television was issued in response to radio reports about the action
at the British, U.S. and Australian Embassies.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. and the Voice of America reported
Friday that protests were filed by the 12 members of the European
Community and other countries including Japan, Canada and the
United States.
   But the Burmese statement said the protests were filed
separately by the nations since last week.
   ``The broadcast gave the impression that the international
community was collectively protesting the legal measures taken by
the Burmese government,'' the foreign ministry statement said.
   ``It is regrettable to note that what should have been a simple
diplomatic exercise by a few diplomats in the Rnngoon diplomatic
corps has become grossly exaggerated,'' it said.
   A diplomat in Bangkok Thursday said the Burmese government had
detained Burmese staff of the Australian, British and U.S.
embassies.
   He also said armed troops entered the compound of the West
German Embassy last week and that similar action had been taken a
number of times against U.S. and British diplomatic compounds.
   In Washington Thursday, State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said the United States had strongly protested after Burmese
officials detained and interrogated four employees of the U.S.
Embassy.
   The military government has detained large numbers of dissidents
since it seized power in 1988 by crushing a democracy movement.

   The Army announced Friday the deactivation of
the 9th Motorized Infantry Division and the activation of a
separate motorized brigade at Fort Lewis, Wash., as part of a
five-year military reduction plan.
   The deactivation of the 9th will eliminate approximately 7,900
military positions at Fort Lewis by the end of fiscal 1992. It will
also trim about 226 civilian and 121 military support slots from a
total civilian work force at Fort Lewis of 3,842.
   It was not clear how large the new brigade would be. Brigades
generally have about 2,000 personnel.
   Over the next several years population at the base will
eventually grow by 3,000 as a result of the Army's plans to close
Fort Ord, Calif., and ship 10,000 soldiers of Fort Ord's 7th Light
Infantry division to Fort Lewis, said George Behan, press secretary
to Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.
   Behan said 2,900 military personnel will be cut on Oct. 1,
another 3,100 in the next fiscal year and 1,900 in fiscal 1992.
   ``This is part of the overall effort over the next five years
that the Army is planning for a reduction in size and the move of
people into the reserves,'' said Kraig Naasz, press secretary to
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.
   Naasz said the Senate Armed Services Committee wants to cut
100,000 people from the nation's current military forces over the
next five years. There are now about 2.1 million men and women in
the armed forces.
   The army has 18 active divisions, ranging from less than 10,000
to more than 15,000 troops.

   Protesters stoned to
death a taxi driver Friday during a three-day strike against
government-authorized price increases, police said.
   One other person was killed and 30 were injured - including a
couple burned in their car - in strike-related violence since
Wednesday.
   Police said they arrested 300 people, but strike organizers
claimed Friday at least 1,000 protesters had been detained.
   The strike was called to protest a government belt-tightening
program imposed in August to control inflation and bolster the
Caribbean nation's sagging economy. The country's nine major unions
did not take part, limiting the impact of the strike.
   Government subsidies have been lifted from many basic consumer
items such as flour and rice. Insome cases, prices doubled or
tripled.
   The state-controlled gasoline prices have tripled to nearly
$1.50 per gallon since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the
government began gasoline rationing earlier this week.
   Pedro Bautista, 37, was attacked after driving his cab into a
street barricaded with burning tires in San Cristobal, about 17
miles east of the capital. Police spokesman Ramon de la Cruz
Martinez said Bautista was pulled from the taxi and pelted with
stones, and died later at a hospital.
   The protest was led by a new political alliance, the Popular
Organizations Collective, with support from five leftist political
parties.
   Three students were killed last Sunday making a bomb at the
state university.On Wednesday, police in Santiago, the country's
second-largest city, said they discovered an arsenal of homemade
bombs and explosives.
   The Popular Organizations Collective denied any connection with
the university deaths or the arsenal.
   A two-day nationwide strike in August paralyzed the nation of 7
million people and led to clashes between police and protesters. At
least 12 people were killed, 60 were wounded and 2,000 arrested.

   The Texas system of electing district judges
by countywide voting was upheld Friday by a federal appeals court
that said questions about possibly diluted minority voting strength
do not apply.
   Protections against diluting the voting power of minorities have
no bearing on the election of judges because they are not public
servants, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 12-1.
   Judge Sam D. Johnson of Austin, Texas, in a scathing 47-page
dissent, wrote: ``The majority opinion is not simply wrong, it is
dangerous.''
   The decision affects nine Texas counties but has possible
broader applications. It came hours before a similar challenge was
to be argued in a Baton Rouge federal court.
   Another challenge is pending in Georgia, which is in a different
federal appeals court circuit.
   The majority opinion, written by Judge Thomas Gibbs Gee of
Houston, said judges, unlike legislators and other elected
officials, are not public servants. In fact, they often must defy
public opinion to carry out the law, he wrote.
   Gee wrote that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, an amendment
passed in 1982, was a test to determine what dilutes voting
strength, but it stopped short of imposing such a test for judicial
offices.
   ``Should Congress seek to install such a test for judicial
elections, it must say so plainly,'' he wrote. ``Instead, it has
thus far plainly said the contrary.''
   In his dissent, Johnson called the majority decision completely
isolated from other rulings.
   ``No previous court has ever even suggested that judicial
elections might be exempt from the reach of Section 2 of the Voting
Rights Act,'' he wrote. ``To the contrary, this court ... had
earlier concluded that Section 2 applied to all elections,
including judicial elections.
   ``Not only does the majority opinion reverse this two-year-old
precedent, but it also demonstrates a shocking lack of concern for
the urgently argued position of the attorney general, who has
consistently maintained that the Voting Rights Act reaches all
elections.''
   The case was brought to court by the League of United Latin
American Citizens, which argued that countywide voting for state
judges in nine urban counties prevents minorities from electing the
candidates they want.
   U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton of Midland agreed and ordered
the state to divide the nine counties into electoral subdistricts.
   Those counties - Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant, Travis,
Lubbock, Midland, Ector and Jefferson - elect 172 of Texas' 390
district judges.
   A three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit upheld the Texas system,
however. It then brought the case back before the entire panel for
reconsideration. Thirteen of the 15 circuit court members
participated.
   An attorney for the group said they'll appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   ``We think that any election system that discriminates on the
basis of race and ethnicity is inconsistent with the most basic
Democratic principles of our society,'' said Rolando Rios of San
Antonio.
   The Texas and Louisiana cases are virtually identical.
   ``We're just delighted with the opinion,'' said John Kennedy,
legal counsel for Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer. ``It's a complete
victory.''
   In the Louisiana case, U.S. District Judge John Parker ordered
that 11 districts be redesigned to enhance the chance of electing
black judges. Only six of Louisiana's 254 district and appellate
court judges are black.
   Also at issue in Louisiana is a state Supreme Court district in
New Orleans, the only district in the state represented by two
justices elected at large.
   A similar challenge in Mississippi led to special judicial
elections being held in 1989 under a federal court order.
   U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. of Jackson was the
first federal judge in the nation to apply Section 2 of the Voting
Rights Act to judicial elections. His ruling, which said the
state's judicial districts discriminated against blacks, was upheld
by a special three-judge federal panel appointed to review the
decision.

   Years of discrimination at Mississippi
state colleges are over, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.
   ``The record makes clear that Mississippi has adopted and
implemented race neutral policies for operating its colleges and
universities and that all students have real freedom of choice to
attend the college or university they wish,'' Judge John M. Duhe
Jr. wrote in Friday's majority decision issued by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
   The 10-4 decision by the appeals court reversed a finding by a
three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit that Mississippi illegally
operates separate universities for blacks and whites and that
opening admissions to all races in 1962 didn't go far enough.
   Mississippi operates three predominantly black universities and
five that have a majority of white students.
   The late Jake Ayers filed the suit in 1975 on behalf of his son,
Jake Ayers Jr., then in high school, and 20 other black students.
   The case was closely watched in Louisiana, where a similar
challenge is pending over the status of predominantly black schools
like Grambling, Southern, and others.
   William F. Goodman Jr. of Jackson, attorney for the State
College Board, praised the ruling.
   ``It removes the doubts about the legality of the Mississippi
system of higher education,'' Goodman said. ``Secondly, the
decision vindicates the efforts of many people over the past 20
years who have worked so hard to integrate the system.''
   Morris Kinsey, chairman of the education committee of the
Mississippi NAACP, said the decision creates another obstacle to
getting more funding for black colleges.
   ``I am stunned by this one,'' Kinsey said. ``I guess we'll just
have to take our appeal further. We were concerned that when we had
the arguments before the full court that they were not interested
in our arguments.''
   Justice Department officials in Washington, who argued
Mississippi fostered discrimination through college admission
requirements and failing to upgrade facilities at black schools,
said they were reviewing the decision and would not have any
immediate comment.
   Chief Judge Charles Clark of Mississippi did not take part in
the decision.

   Saddam Hussein is moving to transform Kuwait
into an Iraqi province by altering the country's demography,
erasing its national identity and removing its infrastructure, U.S.
analysts say.
   ``What we are seeing is the de-Kuwaitization of Kuwait. This is
the history of the Iraqi regime,'' one U.S. official said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The Iraqi president has been changing Kuwait since the Aug. 2
invasion - even renaming streets and institutions to eliminate
signs of the ousted government, officials said. Every passing day
takes the country further away from what it once was.
   At the same time, the Kuwaiti resistance inside the occupied

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) - A court today convicted 16 soldiers
in the murder of President Corazon Aquino's husband but failed to
say who ordered the assassination which set the stage for the 1986
revolution.
   The impact of the decision was further clouded by the court's
acquittal of 20 people in the 1983 slaying of Sen. Benigno
``Ninoy'' Aquino, the country's top opposition leader at the time.
   Other defendants, including a former military chief of staff,
have fled the country to avoid prosecution.
   The verdict in the 3{-year trial was announced on the first
anniversary of the death of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who
many Filipinos believe ordered the Aquino's slaying.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is
wielding less and less power and is in danger of becoming
irrelevant as restive Soviet republics wrest authority from the
central government, a senior administration official says.
   The official, insisting on anonymity, said Thursday that
Gorbachev's loss of power is a bigger threat to him than any coup
by the military. Rumors of a military takeover have surfaced in
Moscow in recent days, but the senior official discounted that
possibility.
   It is highly unusual that a government official - even when
guaranteed protection against being identified - would offer such a
candid and damaging assessment of a world leader of Gorbachev's
stature.
   Moreover, the portrayal of Gorbachev as a faltering figure
clashes with the picture that President Bush tried to project when
he flew thousands of miles to Helsinki this month to stand
alongside the Soviet president in a demonstration that the
superpowers are united against Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Supreme Court nominee David Souter can expect
an easy confirmation vote in the Senate next week following a
lopsided endorsement by the Judiciary Committee.
   But the breadth of voting support enjoyed by the Nw Hampshire
jurist belies widespread doubt lawmakers are expressing about what
kind of justice he'll make.
   ``I will vote for Judge Souter's confirmation. I do not do so
enthusiastically,'' Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden said
before his panel voted 13-1 in favor of Souter on Thursday. Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., was the dissenter.
   If President Bush takes the ease of Souter's approval as a sign
it can easily win an even more conservative choice in the future,
he would be wrong, said Biden, D-Del.

<TEXT>
   Does it make sense to penalize the middle class
in order to deny the wealthy?
   Elected officials argued in recent weeks that to accede to
President Bush's wish and lower the maximum capital gains tax to 15
percent from 28 percent would disproportionately benefit the rich.
That would never do, they said.
   What many opponents failed to explain is that a lower tax also
would benefit the hard-working middle class, including many
farmers, owners of small businesses, small investors and various
other less-than-rich Americans.
   It would help farmers who built up a valuable property from
nothing and who now wish to retire, homeowners whose financial
gains on a property sale exceed the deductible limit, entrepreneurs
who created value out of an idea.
   The big investor would benefit from lower taxes, but so would
the investor who put $3,000 into stocks in 1985, saw them ``grow''
to $3,500 in 1990, and who, after taxes, commissions and inflation,
has about a $180 profit.
   Had that person put the money in a relatively riskless savings
account earning just over 5 percent annually, the after-tax,
after-inflation profit might have been more than double that.
   This is but one example of inconsistencies in the capital gains
debate, during which the issue became so embroiled in politics that
several of the important financial and social implications were
lost.
   It takes capital investments, for example, to develop new
businesses which create wealth, provide jobs and eventually grow
large enough to compete with larger companies, thus adding to
market competition and fair pricing.
   It takes people with ideas, too, and often those people do not
have the capital. Unlike existing businesses that have ready access
to capital from pension funds, the beginners must beg for capital.
And they must offer something in return.
   What they offer investors is a reasonable hope that the company
will succeed and repay them for accepting the risk and the
long-term commitment of their funds.
   In the capital gains debate, profit was mentioned far more than
risk, but profit is never assured in capital investments, whereas
risk is. Risk means the possibility of loss, and that possibility
is high. Small companies often fail.
   There has to be a good inducement, therefore, for investors to
commit money to risky but economically and socially worthwhile
ventures. But taxes and long-term inflation, beginners will tell
you, sometimes destroy that inducement.
   Throughout the debate, references were made to the tax-deferred
aspect of capital investments, but less was said about the
long-term commitment of those funds, which, of course, precludes
their use in any other way.
   That issue might seem minor, but that commitment of funds can be
for a lifetime, during which the investor might build a large
operation but have a relatively small income. His wealth is
committed; it cannot be withdrawn.
   Perhaps the most positive result of the debate was to clarify
the meaning of profit. If profit really was what it was defined as
being by otherwise informed people, then everyone would be rich.
Inflation, they said, was profit.
   On reflection, everyone understands that inflation is a minus.
It is deducted from ``profit.'' Ten percent inflation wipes out a 5
percent wage increase and leaves you with a 5 percent loss, not a
profit.
   Somehow, that reasoning was not always applied to capital gains,
where inflation was called profit even by political leaders who
claimed to have thoroughly analyzed the issue. In fact, inflation
was actually taxed as profit.
   That irony at least has been clarified.

<HEAD>Italy's Communist Party Admits to Role in 100s of Postwar Killings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   An aging Communist has reopened one of the darkest
chapters of Italy's postwar history, charging that his party was
behind a three-year reign of terror in a region dubbed the
``triangle of death.''
   The Communist, Otello Montanari, has accused his party of
covering up its members' role in the hundreds of killings that
plagued north-central Italy for years after dictator Benito
Mussolini was killed.
   He also revealed that the Communist Party helped the killers
flee to Czechoslovakia.
   In response to his charges, the Communist Party has finally
admitted it bore some responsibility for the rash of slayings in
the so-called ``triangle of death.''
   The disclosures by Montanari, 65, have shocked many Italians and
led to a re-evaluation of the anti-Fascist Resistance, one of the
country's most revered ideals.
   The debate has also widened a split in the West's largest
Communist Party, already reeling from the collapse of communism in
Eastern Europe.
   ``Forty-five years have gone by. It's time to attentively judge
these affairs. It is necessary for democracy, for the Resistance,''
Montanari said in an Aug. 28 letter to a Bologna newspaper that
sparked the debate.
   The triangle of death was part of the ``red zone'' of northern
Italy. Even today, it is dominated by the Communist Party, the
country's second-biggest party.
   When Mussolini was killed in April 1945, Communists and other
Resistance fighters went on a two-month orgy of revenge. At least
12,000 people, most suspected of supporting fascism, were slain
before a new government restored order.
   But in the triangle of death - bounded by the cities of Modena,
Reggio Emilia and Bologna - the killings continued for another
three years. Hundreds more people were slain, including former
Fascist officials, factory managers, landowners and Roman Catholic
priests.
   Montanari, a former partisan and party leader in Reggio Emilia,
charged some Communist officials in the area had ``an attitude of
tolerance, of covering-up and even of close cooperation'' with the
killers.
   ``Whoever knows about it, must speak,'' he appealed.
   His call has led to an outpouring of new details in national
newspapers and on television from Communists and relatives of
victims, some breaking decades of silence.
   Their accounts, as well as newly publicized academic research,
indicate Communist ex-partisans carried out many of the killings.
   They depict a Communist Party leadership that publicly blamed
ex-Fascists for the murders, but secretly helped scores of those
responsible to escape to Yugoslavia and then Czechoslovakia, which
had come under Communist rule.
   ``It has been the end of a myth,'' said Ennio Dinolfo, a
professor at the University of Florence who has written a book
about Italian history from 1943-53. ``The party did its best to
keep this hidden.''
   The disclosures have sometimes been painful for a country that
often seems to gloss over its Fascist past while enshrining the
Resistance.
   ``It was Italy's one claim to respectability'' after the war,
noted Oxford University historian Denis Mack Smith, a specialist on
Italy.
   The new accusations have particularly angered the older,
hard-line members of the Communist Party. Many took part in the
Resistance, which included a large number of Communists and other
parties.
   ``To repudiate the Resistance means to destroy the principal
pillar on which the civil co-existence of the postwar period is
built,'' said five party officials, all former partisans, in a
statement.
   Two thousand people gathered in Reggio Emilia on Sept. 8 for a
silent march to protest a hastily called congress by neo-Fascists
to re-examine the killings in the triangle of death.
   ``Hands off the Resistance,'' read one of their signs.
   The Communists emphasize that their postwar leader, Palmiro
Togliatti, condemned the violence in the triangle of death.
   But the young reformers who now dominate the Italian Communist
Party, or PCI, have called for ``glasnost'' and a re-examination of
the period.
   ``The initiative of Otello Montanari ... brings to light the
responsibility of the PCI and of its leadership, and we must
reflect on this,'' said Piero Fassino, the party's director of
organization.
   Part of the controversy about the killings is why the
information has only emerged now, more than a decade after scholars
began discovering it.
   Some observers say the younger Communists are trying to use the
disclosures to discredit their older rivals, who oppose efforts to
reform the party and drop the Communist name.
   Others say the information has emerged because the Communists
fear Czechoslovakia's new democratic government might have made
some of it public soon.
   Giorgio Bocca, a newspaper columnist and author of several books
on postwar Italy, said the scandal is tied to the decline of the
Communist Party in recent years.
   ``When the PCI was strong, everybody shut up, even the
middle-class newspapers,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   He and others say that the dominant Christian Democrat party
worked closely with the opposition Communists in the past, and
didn't want to embarrass them.

   The idealism that cushioned East
Europeans through last year's democratic upheavals has begun to
wane. But a small group of Americans is hoping to show there is
still a place for such dreams.
   The first Peace Corps volunteers in Eastern Europe are infecting
Hungarians with some of the idealism on which America has
prospered.
   For Hungarians and other East Europeans, the initial euphoria at
throwing off four decades of Communism has given way to gloom as
people struggle to make ends meet amid inflation, unemployment and
the vageries of a new political and economic system.
   The 57 enthusiastic Peace Corps volunteers are teaching a
valuable skill that will help break down four decades of Cold War
barriers. They also will help alleviate a sense of isolation
inevitable after 40 years of Soviet domination, anti-Western
propaganda and restricted travel.
   Bonita Plymale, 39, who has been assigned to a new
teacher-training college, said she thought Hungarians also felt cut
off because their language is unrelated to any of the main European
language families and difficult to learn.
   Dave Billett, 27, a volunteer at a dilapidated school on
Budapest's Csepel island - a workers' district - said the contact
with Americans enabled Hungarians to see that ``the basic human
(and) societal problems are the same'' in the West.
   Hungarian teachers have told volunteers they gain confidence
from conversation with native English teachers. Behind the Iron
Curtain, English teachers themselves often have never spoken to
native speakers.
   For the Peace Corps, the assignments in Hungary and Poland
fulfill what director Paul Coverdell says was a long-standing goal
of bringing U.S. skills and culture to Eastern Europe.
   The Cold War kept the Peace Corps out for four decades.
   Now, ``the wall is down and the Peace Corps is clambering over
it,'' Coverdell said in an interview at the organization's cramped
Budapest office.
   The volunteers who took up teaching posts in every county in
Hungary in September were all ages and from varied backgrounds. But
they were united in a desire to contribute to Hungary's struggle to
get equal with the West in democratic principles and opportunities.
   Plymale traced her motivation for leaving Highland High School
in Albuquerque, N.M., after 17 years to the ideals of the 1960s,
when the Peace Corps got off the ground.
   ``I think there are many people in the United States who are
taking stock of what they're doing and maybe going back to some of
the ideals we had in the late 60s and early 70s,'' she said.
   Another reason she cited is likely to surprise Hungarians,
dazzled by the variety of goods available in the West to consumers
who can afford to buy them.
   Plymale, who headed her school's English department for the last
six years, said she wanted to get away from ``worrying about how
much money I'm making.''
   Coverdell said interest in the Peace Corps has increased
dramatically recently, partly as a result of rapid changes around
the world.
   It was President Bush who proposed during his visit to Hungary
in July 1989 that Peace Corps volunteers come to Hungary and
Poland.
   Coverdell said he hopes the organization, which has about 7,000
volunteers in Africa, Asia and Central and South America, will send
people soon to most countries in the former East bloc.
   A Peace Corps program is to begin in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in
November. Coverdell said Bulgaria and Yugoslavia are also
interested in English teachers.
   In Romania, a team is looking at children's health to determine
whether the Peace Corps could be of assistance.
   Laszlo Vida, a senior Hungarian Education Ministry official,
said he hopes to see the Peace Corps program expanded.
   ``We are very pleased to have the Peace Corps here,'' Vida said.
   Students appeared to echo that enthusiasm.
   On the second day of class, children in his secondary school
begged him to stay beyond the two-year Peace Corps assignment,
Billett said.
   Plymale and Billett, a freelance TV production manager in
Hollywood before he joined the Peace Corps, both said that in
addition to telling Hungarians about the United States, they had a
lot to learn from the Hungarians.
   Plymale said she found the Hungarian educational system
``excellent'' and hoped to learn new techniques.
   Billett, who is eager to learn Hungarian, was impressed with
stories he has heard from Hungarians about their experience of the
past 40 years.
   Despite the hardship, he said, ``they still have a sense of
humor.''

<HEAD>PBS' Top Science Show Opens Season with ... a Comedy-Drama?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most delightful program on television
Tuesday night is a mystery-comedy-espionage thriller about a
mild-mannered astronomer who tracks down a KGB-financed spy ring.
   It's the true story of Clifford Stoll, a tale of suspense, high
technology, international intrigue, wonderful sight gags - even a
shower scene! - and it's the season premiere of ``Nova,'' PBS' fine
science documentary series.
   ``The KGB, the Computer and Me,'' is Stoll's account, re-enacted
by him and the other people involved, of his two-year hunt for a
computer hacker who had systematically penetrated the U.S. network
of military and academic computers.
   In August 1986, Stoll was a stock comic figure of academe: a
scientist whose grant had expired. With his wiry shock of dark hair
and laid-back wardrobe, he looks more like a Grateful Dead fan
(which he is) than an astronomer.
   Fortunately for him and the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory at the
University of California at Berkeley, the lab needed a manager for
its computer system, and he was hired.
   On his first day in his new job, the boss asks him to track down
a 75-cent discrepancy in the computer billing report.
   ``Thousands of dollars of charges, off by 75 cents, didn't sound
like much,'' Stoll noted, ``but it was an interesting problem. A
big error would mean an obvious bug in the system, easy to find and
fix.
   ``But 75 cents? That was a challenge!''
   And thereby hangs a fascinating story about science, scientists
and the business of doing science.
   The 75-cent error eventually led Stoll to the electronic
fingerprints of a hacker who'd used a personal computer and
telephone connection to break into the Berkeley computer system
from far away.
   ``He was really like a burglar who knows a few ways to
burglarize a house and uses them over and over again,'' Stoll
recounted in a telephone interview. ``He tries the front door, the
back door, and pushes on a couple of windows, and when he can't get
in, he moves on.
   ``He figures, `Sooner or later I'll find one where somebody left
the key in the door.' ''
   Tight computer security - like burglar bars on windows - make
the ``environment'' more difficult for its legitimate occupants as
well as potential invaders. The hacker was exploiting the system's
openness.
   Once inside the computer, the hacker used standard programming
techniques to exploit a ``bug'' in the computer's operating system
and take it over.
   Invisibly, the hacker had made himself a ``super-user'' able to
read, write, erase and remove any file in the program.
   Stoll was angry and appalled. Part of the lab's computer system
is used in high-energy radiation therapy for certain brain tumors.
The hacker was fooling with computer programs that aim heavy
radiation into living people's brains.
   ``When you screw around with systems that you don't know about,
you can't predict what the effects will be,'' Stoll said. ``He
thought he knew and he didn't.''
   It would have been a simple matter to lock out the hacker, fix
the bug in the system and wrap things up, but Stoll wanted to catch
him or her or it.
   And, to his growing concern, the hacker was using the Lawrence
Berkeley computer to move around on the network of university and
non-classified Defense Department computers around the country.
   The hacker was intruding into military databases, defense
contractors, even the Pentagon. True, none of the material was
classified, but it also wasn't the kind of information you read in
the newspapers, either.
   Stoll went to the FBI. A 75-cent error? They weren't interested.
Stoll's quest ultimately led him to ``various three-letter
agencies'' that included the CIA and the ultra-secret NSA.
   ``It was frustrating to find people who really are bureaucrats,
who very much want to help but can't because of the structure of
where they work,'' Stoll said.
   ``The rumors that you hear are true: The government would like
to help you, but it can't. It just doesn't know how,'' he said.
   Stoll persisted, and his efforts eventually led to the arrest,
trial and conviction of a group of West German hackers with links
to the KGB. Stoll even testified at their trial.
   The story he re-enacts, and his equally fascinating book about
the case, ``The Cuckoo's Egg,'' are about science, Stoll insists.
   ``A lot of the time we think the idea of science is to come up
with answers,'' he said. ``That is so bogus!
   ``If you're doing good science, you don't care what the answer
is. You want to find the process, the method. You passionately want
to find the procedure. It seems to me the work I did in catching
this hacker would have been just as satisfying if it had turned out
to be some teen-ager down the block.''

<HEAD>Uncertainty Pervades Election Outlook in House Races</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elections for the nation's 435 House seats are
likely to yield only slight shifts in power, but analysts caution
that this year's voting could be among the most volatile and
unpredictable in years.
   November's balloting will follow ``one of the strangest 18
months in recent political history,'' analyst Charles Cook says of
a period that has seen upheavals in Eastern Europe, the Persian
Gulf, domestic issues and the American economy.
   Few are willing to bet on where it all will lead, but most
analysts and operatives are guessing that Democrats will pad their
258-to-176 majority by less than 10 seats.
   In normal times, that would be a face-saving outcome for
Republicans. As the party in control of the White House, the GOP
historically could expect to lose 15 or more House seats in an
off-year election.
   Several factors would seem to favor the GOP this time around.
President Bush enjoys near-record popularity ratings, his standing
increased by his handling of the Middle East crisis. And polls show
a general public disgust with Congress, which is controlled by the
Democrats.
   But on the other side of the ledger, the economy - among the
most powerful determinants of political fortune - is headed
downward. And Republicans are being forced to defend more so-called
``open'' seats, where there is no incumbent seeking re-election,
because 11 otherwise safe GOP House members are running for the
Senate or state offices.
   The effect of the volatility has been to put most races into
slow motion. Congress, which had planned to adjourn by Oct. 5 so
members could go home and campaign, now is unlikely to get out of
Washington until Oct. 20 or so.
   Issues that have taken on local importance, from abortion to
taxes and the savings and loan crisis, have had to compete for air
time and headlines with developments in Iraq and Kuwait. Political
experts say the effect will be to compress the intense part of the
election season into the final two weeks.
   For one in five House districts, that will make no difference.
Seventy-six incumbent lawmakers - 42 Democrats and 34 Republicans -
will coast to re-election without major party opposition.
   And, as has become common in House contests, few of their
colleagues have much to worry about. Political analysts single out
fewer than two dozen races where the incumbent is endangered.
   Topping that list are Reps. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., Charles
Pashayan, R-Calif., and Denny Smith, R-Ore., all of whom are linked
to the $500 billion scandal over the failure of the savings and
loan industry.
   A handful of others are in trouble because of political or
ethical problems:
   - Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., got in hot water for running
up hundreds of long-distance calls to a former female staffer on
his official House credit card.
   - It was revealed that Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., who accepts large
contributions from the defense industry in his capacity as an Armed
Services Committee member, claimed conscientious objector status
during the Vietnam War.
   - Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said during a debate with his
Democratic opponent that he opposes affirmative action because ``it
is worse to discriminate against majorities'' than against racial
minorities.
   And always vulnerable are freshmen, many of whom won narrowly in
1988 and have yet to establish themselves firmly in their new
seats: Ben Jones, D-Ga.; George Sangmeister, D-Ill.; Bill
Sarpalius, D-Texas; Greg Laughlin, D-Texas; Peter Hoagland, D-Neb.;
Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash.; Craig James, R-Fla.; Ron Machtley, R-R.I.;
and Peter Smith, R-Vt.
   Most of the action, and the attention of Democratic and
Republican party operatives, focuses on the 29 open seats where
there is no incumbent. Eleven are seats previously held by
Democrats, and 18 were formerly GOP seats.
   One hotspot is Maine's First District, where Democrat Joseph
Brennan is running to get back his old job as governor. Fighting
for Brennan's House seat are Democratic state Sen. Tom Andrews and
Republican David Emery, who is making a comeback bid.
   Also tough for Democrats to defend is the Cincinnati district of
Thomas Luken, who is retiring. Luken's son, Mayor Charles Luken, is
vying against Ken Blackwell, a former Cincinnati mayor and official
of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Blackwell is
the GOP's best hope of electing a black Republican to a House seat
in five decades.
   A slugfest has developed in the Texas, where Democratic Rep.
Marvin Leath is retiring. State Sen. Chet Edwards, a Democrat, is
running to replace him against Republican Hugh Shine, a state House
member. Shine has been attacking Edwards for appearing at a
fund-raiser for a gay and lesbian group in Houston last year.
   Democrats see their best hopes at picking open seats in
Arkansas, where Democrat-turned-Republican Tommy Robinson left his
seat to run for governor; and in Rhode Island, Hawaii, Iowa and
Idaho, where Republican House members are running for Senate seats.

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Mexico to Chile, millions of Latin
American Indians, descendants of warriors who fought the Spanish
conquerors five centuries ago, are again rising against the white
man.
   The new fighting spirit was sparked by official plans to
celebrate in 1992 the 500th year of the discovery of America by
Spain. But the real goals are better living conditions and equal
rights to land, schools, health care and jobs.
   A survey by Associated Press correspondents shows the region's
30 million Indians are by far the poorest segment of Latin
America's 437 million residents.
   Various reports from U.N. agencies, governments and private
groups had come to the same conclusion, based on Indians' poor
general living conditions, generally inadequate housing, lack of
frequent access to utilities, and even more limited access, if any,
to education.
   Most non-Indian Latin Americans view the discovery celebrations
as a tribute to the merging of the European and Indian culture, and
to the Spanish legacy.
   For the Indians, it is a sour reminder of what they see as
bloody conquest and material and cultural spoliation.
   The Spanish conquerors transferred tons of gold and silver to
Spain from the newly discovered land, especially from Mexico and
Peru, after dominating the natives in bloody wars.
   ``The Spanish conquest must be repudiated. Celebrating it would
shameful and the justification of a massacre,'' said Manuel Castro,
an Indian leader in Ecuador.
   Nearly everywhere in Latin America, Indian organizations are
protesting the plans for solemnly marking the centennial, which
includes a visit to the region in October by the Spanish king and
queen.
   Many are seeking elimination of Columbus Day - Oct. 12 - as a
holiday. They demand it be declared ``a day of Indian dignity.''
   Genaro Dominguez, leader of the Regional Coordinating Agency of
nndian Peoples in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean said
that instead of marking Oct. 12 with a tribute to Columbus, Indians
in his region are paying homage to Mexico's Indian leader,
Cuahutemoc.
   But the new fight centers most on demands for progress on
Indians' social and economic problems.
   About 300 delegates from 120 Indian groups gathered last July in
Quito, Ecuador, and passed a resolution vowing to fight for
autonomy, saying the centennial ``opens a new stage in the struggle
of our peoples.''
   Indians in Latin America seldom have access to their nations'
job market.
   Those who emigrate to the cities often end up getting low menial
jobs, though there have been reports of Indian professional success
stories recently in Guatemala, and most complain of what they call
discrimination from ``the white man.''
   Others remaining in wartorn countryside such as El Salvador and
Peru live in shacks in ``reducciones,'' small plots of generally
poor land, remnants of the sprawling territories their ancestors
once owned. Most reducciones lack basic services such as
electricity and running water.
   Besides, urban emigration worsens racism and discrimination,
said Marcelino Cayuqueo, an Araucano Indian leader in Argentina.
   In addition to facing widespread prejudices, ``such as the
belief that all Indians are lazy, dirty and drink too much,'' said
Chilean Mapuche Indian leader Jose Ancan, many of them develop what
sociologists call ``the Indian syndrome.''
   Cayuqueo described the syndrome ``as an instinctive rejection by
Indians to accept their condition as such.''
   That's a common problem among Mexico's 15 million Indians,
nearly one-fourth of the Mexican population. Those who emigrate to
the cities usually only get modest jobs, such as domestic work, or
end up begging in the streets.
   Arturo Warman, an executive of Mexico's Institute of Indian
Studies, said there are about 5 million Indians ``living under
extreme poverty'' in that country. Illiteracy is rampant. About
350,000 Indians in Honduras are reported plagued by poverty and
disease, living in hamlets in remote mountain areas.
   Meliton Garcia, a Mexican Indian leader, said the proper way to
mark the centennial would be ``by solving our problems.''
   Indian leaders say the solution to their problems must begin
with the recognition by the governments of their ethnic traditions,
cultures, language and religions, and the restoration of their
land.
   Last month, 800 Bolivian Indians walked through the jungle
lowlands from Amazonia to the mountain city of La Paz to demand
land from the government. President Jaime Paz Zamora promised to
meet their demands.
   In Bolivia, where Indians or dominantly Indian mixed-race people
account for about 80 percent of a population of 6.9 million, they
complain of discrimination from the white minority.
   Most Indian leaders complain they also lack legislation to
protect them. Or, if it exists, it doesn't work.
   ``The laws are good in theory, but they are not implemented, or
simply there is no money,'' said Julio Estrada, secretary of the
Colombian National Organization.
   In Ecuador, Indians account for 35 percent of the Andean
nation's 10 million people. Last August, they showed their strength
by staging two ``uprisings'' - for three days, they seized a number
of highways and farms to press the government for solutions to
their problems.
   Indians angrily dispute the notion of discovery of their land by
the Spaniards, saying, ``You don't discover a land that is already
populated.''
   They also reject the Roman Catholic Church joining the
celebrations to mark the ``evangelization'' on the New World.
   ``They imposed their God on people who already had their God or
Gods,'' said Mapuche leader Ancan.
   Added Juan Carlos Ramirez, executive director of Costa Rica's
National Commission of Indian Affairs, ``The celebrations have been
poorly conceived. The notion of discovery is diminishing to Indian
peoples.''
   Political groups, especially from the left, and some missionary
organizations have gained influence over the Indian movement.
   The Mexico-based Council for the Restoration of Indian Rights
admitted that the combative opposition to the centennial
celebrations ``has political connotations.''
   One of the most widespread and controversial Indian demands is
the restoration of part of their ancestors' land they claim was
illegally taken from them by force by white farmers.
   ``We want restoration of our land now,'' said Numa Mallorquiin,
an Indian leader in Paraguay.
   Indians also claim they will not be fully integrated to the
societies in their country unless the governments officially
implement bilingual education in the schools.
   War is long gone, but violence is often still part of life for
Indians, including a handful of tribes still living in primitive
isolation.
   In Brazil, where conquerors came from Portugal, not Spain, the
Missionary Indian Council, a Catholic group promoting Indian
rights, recently denounced what it called ``the genocide of the
Yanomani,'' considered the world's largest primitive tribe.
   Since 1987, the Council said, 1,500 out of 9,000 Yanomanis in
northern Brazil have been killed by white men attracted by gold and
diamond mines discovered on their land. An offshoot of the
Yanomanis not known to exist was discovered this summer in southern
Venezuela.

<HEAD>Bank Dividends Become Increasingly Vulnerable to Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Has Chase Manhattan Bank become the trendsetter
among banks when it comes to slashing dividends?
   That question has had the industry abuzz ever since Chase sliced
its payout to shareholders in half little more than a week ago.
Regionals Midlantic Corp. and Southeast Banking Corp. shortly
thereafter said that they would cut or eliminate their dividends,
followed by similar announcement from the bigger Bank of Boston.
   ``We're still in a very awkward phase here,'' said Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. analyst Judah Kraushaar. ``Many banks are reluctant to
compare themselves with Chase.''
   Still, experts agree that Chase's move takes the edge off other
institutions, which now feel they can trim dividends without a
major public relations disaster.
   High dividend yields - which have been approaching 20 percent of
earnings for some big banks - have helped lure investors and prop
up the price of bank stocks for some time. But it seems that
support is weakening.
   Bank stock prices have gone into a tailspin. Among issues that
touched lows for the past year are Bank of New York, Bankers Trust,
J.P. Morgan, Manufacturers Hanover, NCNB Corp. and First Chicago,
among others.
   Citicorp, for example, traded as high as $35.50 a share in the
past 52 weeks but has sunk to around $14. Its $1.78 dividend
represents nearly 8 percent of the current stock price.
   ``Many people got used to idea that bank dividends are
sacrosanct, but given the way stock prices are being pounded, there
is a growing expectation within the institutional community that
banks simply cannot sustain these dividends,'' one industry
observer said.
   Chase said halving its regular dividend to $1.20 per common
share on an annual basis was part of its move to ``reach higher
levels of capital.'' Analysts have estimated the move could save
Chase as much as $150 million a year.
   Saddled with non-performing debt to Third World countries and
bad domestic real estate loans, banks' ability to increase earnings
has been severely curtailed.
   Among institutions viewed as particularly vulnerable are the
Bank of New York, Chemical Bank, Citibank and First Chicago,
Kraushaar said, because their core capital, or owners' equity, has
declined below 4 percent.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. plans to approve a rule by
the end of the year that would allow only the strongest banks -
about one in five - to maintain a minimum core capital level of 3
percent. Others would be required to maintain minimums ranging
between 4 percent and 5 percent.
   Cutting or eliminating dividends would give banks a quick fix,
since money not paid out to investors could be poured back into
earnings coffers. But long-term problems still plague the industry.
   A weakening economy, a real estate market expected to get worse
before it improves, and a decline in general business activity -
from mergers and acquisitions to businesses' capital spending plans
- will deprive banks of old revenue sources for some time to come.
   One thing that would prop up bank stocks would be ``a lot of
excess capacity coming out of the banking industry,'' Kraushaar
said, or in other words, mergers between large institutions.
   ``They could try to cut out lots of redundancies and build
earnings through cost cutting,'' he said.
   The trick for investors is to identify the institutions that
will survive.

<HEAD>GOP Still Sees Potential for Senate Gains in November Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican hopes of slashing the Democrats'
55-45 Senate majority hinge on the potential for a voter earthquake
to shake things up in the final weeks before Election Day.
   Republicans so far have been unable to turn the electorate
against a swath of Democratic incumbents whom the GOP identified
earlier this year as potentially vulnerable.
   All but one Democratic incumbent is leading in the polls. But
Democrats concede the Republican claim that voters have been
distracted by the crisis in the Persian Gulf and are just starting
to focus on the races.
   ``Six weeks out, and voters are only now paying attention,''
said Anita Dunn, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. ``I don't think any lead right now is very meaningful.''
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, recalled that in 1980 and 1986, the last two
years where the Senate changed parties, ``the races really didn't
close until the last three weeks.''
   The GOP is ``certainly within striking distance'' in many races
this year, even if the polls don't always show it, he said. The
list includes Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Hawaii, Nebraska, Montana
and Rhode Island.
   If Republicans get most of the breaks, which Nickles says is
unlikely, they could pick up the five seats needed to wrest control
from the Democrats.
   But the GOP clearly would be satisfied with gaining just two or
three seats, which would make the Democrats especially vulnerable
in 1992, when many who barely won office in 1986 are up for
re-election for the first time.
   Currently, Hawaii Sen. Daniel Akaka is the only incumbent
Democrat who is behind in the polls, and not by much. Akaka was
appointed to the Senate earlier this year to fill the seat of the
late Spark Matsunaga.
   Akaka is running against his former House colleague, Republican
Rep. Pat Saiki.
   Iowa has been a brawl for months between Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin and Republican Rep. Tom Tauke. Republicans say Tauke is
whittling away at Harkin's lead, but Democrats say Tauke was hurt
by the disclosure that he accepted a congressional pay raise he had
campaigned against. Tauke said he took the money, but later donated
it to charity.
   The GOP's heavy recruitment of candidates from the House of
Representatives hasn't worked so well in other cases.
   Michigan, Illinois and Rhode Island are states where the
Democratic incumbents have held tenaciously to leads in polls
despite tough opposition from GOP House members.
   In Michigan, incumbent Democrat Carl Levin was preferred by
voters 2-1 over Rep. Bill Schuette in a recent poll, despite an
aggressive television campaign by the Republican challenger.
   President Bush interceded to get Illinois Rep. Lynn Martin the
GOP nomination to challenge Sen. Paul Simon, but the Democrat has
maintained a solid lead in the polls.
   Rhode Island Rep. Claudine Schneider has proven statewide appeal
in that tiny state. But she's still struggling to chip away at the
popularity of incumbent Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell.
   Earlier this year, Republicans considered Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., as the most vulnerable of their targets. But Baucus has
climbed in the polls in recent weeks to a solid 25-point lead over
conservative Lt. Gov. Allen Kolstad.
   While disappointed that more hasn't happened in those races, the
GOP sees new opportunity in Massachusetts, where voters in the
primary threw out the Democratic Party slate for state officers.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., has been indirectly hurt. Previously
considered safe, Kerry suddenly is just barely ahead of challenger
Rappaport in the polls. Rappaport already has run a television ad
linking Kerry with unpopular Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   But Republicans may have trouble using the ``throw the rascals
out'' tactic in many of the states where they have been most
hopeful, since they recruited so many sitting or former members of
Congress as candidates.
   Democrats are confident Kerry will hold his seat, just as
Republicans are confident Jesse Helms of North Carolina will win,
even though he's in a dead heat in the polls with former Charlotte
mayor Harvey Gantt.
   Both sides point to longshot chances against the others'
incumbents in other states, and Democrats are behind but still hope
to grab one or more of the three seats where Republican incumbents
are retiring in Colorado, Idaho and New Hampshire.
   But perhaps the most unusual race of the year is one where both
parties concede the outcome - that Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
will win re-election.
   The big question is whether Johnston can capture 50 percent of
the vote in Louisiana's Oct. 6 open primary and avoid a runoff in
November with the sure second-place finisher - former Ku Klux
Klansman David Duke.
   Republicans are so worried that Duke will represent their party
on the ticket that they have virtually abandoned the campaign of
their chosen candidate, Ben Bagert, in hopes Johnston can avoid a
runoff.

<HEAD>Oil Reserve Tapped, FDIC Bolstered, Milken Waits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One reserve will be tapped and another bolstered
as federal officials wrestle with two of the economy's biggest
enemies: rising oil prices and a declining bank insurance fund.
   Within a span of 24 hours this past week, President Bush
announced the sale of 5 release was designed to slow the increase in crude
prices, which have risen steadily since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
The FDIC premium hike was aimed at shoring up the sagging banking
business.
   Although the oil only amounts to a few drops from the total 590
million barrels in reserve, the release was significant for its
symbolism. Bush's ``test'' sale signaled his willingness to tap the
reserve to counter the effects of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Germany, Japan and other nations also were considering dipping
into their strategic reserves.
   Bush took some mild heat for the move because it was intended to
dampen speculation in the oil markets, not to fill a supply void.
The reserve was put in place following the oil shocks of the early
1970s to counter oil shortages, not high prices.
   Oil prices continued to advance in the futures market following
the announcement, but some analysts said regular reserve sales
could help stabilize the market over the long term.
   On the banking front, the pressure for a decision on insurance
premiums had been building for weeks as the health of the nation's
biggest banks deteriorated.
   Several major banks announced restructuring plans, including job
reductions and rare dividend cuts. The rash of dividend cuts,
initiated by Chase Manhattan Corp., shocked the stock market, which
had grown accustomed to regular payouts from the big banks.
   One government report showed losses from bank failures had
whittled the insurance fund to $11.4 billion at the end of June,
down 14 percent from the end of last year. L. William Seidman, FDIC
chairman, said he expected the insurance fund to lose $3 billion
this year, half again as much as previously estimated.
   The increase in insurance premiums will force banks to pay 19.5
cents for every $100 in deposits, up from 12 cents this year. If a
bank passed the full increase on to customers, somebody with
$10,000 in a savings account would lose $7.50 in interest over a
year.

<HEAD>MARKETS: Banks, Oil Dragging Down Stocks</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Economic worries intensified the market's recent slide, pushing
the Dow Jones industrial average below the 2,500 mark to levels not
seen since May 1989. The Dow's 12 percent erosion since the first
of the year was persuading many experts that a bear market had
arrived.
   The damage was even more severe in Tokyo, where the Nikkei
average of Japanese stocks suffered more huge losses on concerns
about the Gulf and Japan's own banking sector.
   The Nikkei average, off more than 45 percent on the year,
dropped below the depths reached in the 1987 market crash.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Barely Perceptible Growth</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The economic news from Washington was not encouraging. A report
on the gross national product showed the economy virtually ground
to a halt in the second quarter, growing a mere 0.4 percent.
   The National Association of Business Economists, usually an
optimistic group, said more than half of the professional
forecasters surveyed in late August and early September believed a
recession already had begun or was around the corner.
   The government said its own economic forecasting gauge sank 1.2
percent in August, the steepest drop in nearly three years.
   A study from the Conference Board, a business lobby group, said
consumer confidence in August remained at its lowest level since
the 1982 recession.

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Milken Faces the Music</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Deposed junk-bond king Michael Milken returned to the headlines
as the government and his defense lawyers prepared to play out the
final chapter of his story in open court.
   Milken was due to be sentenced Monday on the six felony counts
to which he pleaded guilty in April. But U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood put off the sentencing after being inundated with hundreds of
pages of documents from both the prosecution and defense painting
starkly different portraits of the financier.
   Prosecutors alleged a broad pattern of wrongdoing by Milken well
beyond the crimes he admitted, and they urged the judge to impose a
stiff prison sentence.
   The defense refuted the additional allegations and described
Milken as a generous, warm human being who should work with ghetto
youth, not go to jail.
   The judge also received hundreds of letters from members of the
public, split along the same lines.
   Postponing the sentencing would allow time for a special hearing
early in October to determine the real Milken. Ivan Boesky,
Milken's chief accuser, could be called to testify.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: A Deal For MCA Emerges</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The stock of entertainment giant MCA Inc. shot up in response to
a reported merger deal with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   Trading around $34 before the news broke, MCA shares climbed to
near $60 in anticipation of the offer, which could bring between
$70 and $90 per share.
   In addition to making MCA stockholders rich, the proposed $7
billion acquisition would combine two top players in entertainment
hardware and software.
   The combination would mirror one established when Sony Corp.
bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $5 billion last year.
   While the idea revived concerns about Japanese purchases of
valuable U.S. assets, the deal looked good for both sides. Analysts
said both needed to grow to compete against Sony and Time Warner
Inc., two of the biggest competitors in the field.

   There's more declining on Wall Street these days
than just stock prices.
   The number of shares changing has dwindled, and analysts say the
slowdown in momentum means the market probably has not hit bottom.
   ``Low volume unfortunately shows the sellers have not done their
dastardly deed yet,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, a vice president at
St. Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. He contends that because
there are more sellers than buyers, it takes more time to
accommodate their desire to unload stocks, and that keeps volume
depressed.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 171.48 million shares a day
this past week. That's higher than the 149.08 million-share daily
average the week before, but still considered low.
   Most market observers would prefer to see that average in the
200-million-shares-a-day range. Higher volume and increased
volatility would be interpreted as a postive sign in a bear market.
   The key to the stock market is not simply whether the Dow Jones
industrial average moves up or down. Volume generally adds
credibitity to market moves, so a rally on high volume says more
about investors' confidence in stocks than a move up on light
volume.
   The weeks when daily Big Board trading volume averaged more than
200 million shares a day have been few and far between this year.
Up until August, however, the Dow average usually rose when the
pace of trading quickened. For example, the Dow was up 63 points on
the week in mid-May, when volume averaged 234 million shares a day.
   But Iraq's invasion of Kuwait marked a turning point. Since then
average daily volume has pretty much held below 200 million shares,
and when activity has neared that level, the Dow average has
tumbled - in some cases nearly 100 points on the week - rathe  than
advance.
   ``The invasion intensified two trajectories of the U.S. economy
that are negative for stocks,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst at
IDEA, a consulting firm. Those are ``higher inflation from higher
oil prices . . . and an economic slowdown,'' both of which cut
corporate profitability and give investors excuses for losing
confidence in stocks.
   The quiet in the market, as evidenced by low volume, ``suggests
that investors - both big and small ones - have become afraid
because the risks of investing now in particular stocks are much
higher,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany
Corp. ``There's more uncertainty today than any time I can recall
in the past 10 years.''
   The Dow Jones average closed Friday at 2,452.48, down 59.90 on
the week and off 428.21 points for the third quarter.
   The best-performing industry groups in the quarter were oil
drilling, which advanced nearly 10 percent, integrated major oil
companies, oil equipment and services, and precious metals,
according to Dow Jones &amp; Co. Industry groups that took the biggest
hit were lodging, home constructionand casinos, each down more than
40 percent.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index settled at 167.85,
down 3.18 on the week; the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market dropped 27.74 to 334.51, and the American
Stock Exchange market value index was down 8.29 at 307.72.

<TEXT>
   Uncertainty about the Middle East and discouraged
individual investors sent stock prices plunging to the lowest point
in 3{ years in Tokyo today. The dollar closed higher against the
Japanese yen.
   The closely watched 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 788.41
points, or 3.62 percent, to finish at 20,983.50. Estimated volume
on the exchange's first section was 450 million shares.
   It was the lowest close since March 3, 1987, when the closely
watched average ended the day at 20,971.39 points. Friday's finish
was also lower than the October 1987 Black Monday drop to
21,910.08.
   On Thursday, the index lost 478.71 points, or 2.15 percent,
closing at 21,771.91.
   Analysts blamed fears of war in the Middle East, high interest
rates, and climbing oil prices for sidelining institutional
investors.
   Benchmark Brent crude prices broke the general upward trend
today by falling slightly in Asia.
   Brent crude for November delivery was valued at about $39.15 to
$39.25 a barrel, or about 10 to 15 cents below levels seen late
Thursday in New York.
   The stock market's own downward momentum, in addition to higher
interest rates, has lured institutional money to other investment
vehicles with higher returns, analysts said.
   ``Institutional investors are taking a safety first approach,''
said Peter Tasker, a strategist for Kleinwort Benson International.
   The sharp drop since Wednesday, however, resulted largely from
individual investors liquidating big portions of their holdings to
meet margin calls from brokers, brokers said.
   The market has dropped by close to half since its all-time high
of 38,915.87 points at the end of last year.
   ``It is a really serious condition. We have not seen as serious
a condition in Japanese history,'' said Akira Yasui, head of
research for County Natwest Securities Japan.
   ``The reverse asset effect that we have now will change the
Japanese economy,'' he said. Capital expenditures by small and
medium-sized industries, for instance, could drop in the next
quarter because a bearish stock market and high interest rates
would make raising money difficult.
   Individual investors, whose stock profits propelled them into a
frenzy of consumption in the last couple of years, will feel the
pinch.
   ``Normal consumption will be fairly firm. But the wealth that
was created by the rise in equities and land prices ... is going to
disappear,'' Tasker said.
   Analysts said the market probably will continue to decline,
particularly if a war breaks out in the Persian Gulf region, but no
one knows how far it will fall. Several mentioned a striking lack
of panic in general, despite a sell-off that hit the market in the
afternoon on a rumor - quickly denied - of bombings in Iraq.
   Fears about the Middle East have benefited the dollar, dealers
said.
   The dollar finished at 137.95 yen, up 0.45 yen from Thursday's
137.50-yen close. The currency opened at 138.33 and trading ranged
between 137.65 yen and 138.38 yen.
   Unless there is a war, the dollar will move in the 135-138 yen
range ``for a while'' although some dealers think the currency is
still generally heading down, said Masato Hayashi, chief customer
dealer for the Bank of Tokyo.
   The stock market's steep slide also has weakened the yen. But
activity on the currency markets should pick up on Monday, the
start of the fiscal year's second half, he said.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No.119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 8.690 percent by 3 p.m. (2 a.m.
EDT) from Thursday's 8.680-percent close. Their price was lower at
80.73 points from 80.79.

<TEXT>
   A union representing about 1,200 San
Francisco newspaper workers unanimously authorized a strike if
contract talks fail to forge an agreement soon.
   ``We've been bargaining since last February, and our members are
increasingly upset that no contract has been reached yet,'' said
Bernie Beck of the Northern California Newspaper Guild's unit at
the San Francisco Chronicle.
   Local Guild President Steven R. Michael said after Thursday's
strike authorization vote that he hoped a strike wouldn't be
necessary. No deadline for completion of contract talks had been
set, he said.
   The Guild represents reporters and certain other employees at
the Chronicle, Examiner and the Newspaper Agency, the jointly owned
company that prints and distributes both papers.
   They have worked without a contract since Feb. 2. The current
contract contains an ``evergreen clause,'' which means it remains
in force until a new agreement is reached, Beck said.
   He said that publishers ``still are at some distance about work
rules'' and that negotiations about things such as wages and hours
haven't even begun.
   In all, about 4,500 employees, represented by the 10 unions, are
working without contracts at the two papers and Newspaper Agency.
The Conference of Newspaper Unions will represent all 10 unions in
wage and economic bargaining, which is expected to begin next week.

   About 7,500 people who inspect beef, pork,
chicken soup and Aunt Linda's favorite brand of liver sausage will
forfeit a big hunk of their October paychecks if no federal
spending deal is worked out.
   Moreover, if the mandatory cutbacks are put in place Monday as
scheduled without a new budget agreement, that special brand of
liver sausage made by a tiny mom-and-pop operation back in the
hills may vanish entirely.
   That's because no one is allowed to sell meat and poultry
products unless it is checked by federal inspectors. And the
inspectors are going to take unpaid holidays - furloughs - next
month.
   Department of Agriculture officials say they do not expect
severe shortages at food stores, but they acknowledge that some
specialty items from small processors could be hit hard.
   Final notices to the nation's 7,000 federally inspected plants
were sent out Thursday by Lester M. Crawford, head of the
department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, or FSIS.
   ``When the furlough becomes effective, the meat and poultry
industry may not engage in any activities that require
inspection,'' Crawford told plant owners.
   Effectively, this will halt production of meat and poultry on
those days specified by Crawford as his agency's furlough period.
And the four-day layoff will continue each two-week pay cycle,
perhaps until 140 days of furlough time has been logged.
   Bill Hudnall, the agency's deputy administrator for
adminstrative management, said about 5,900 federal inspectors check
on the nation's supply of meat and poultry, along with 1,300
veterinarians and 300 food technologists.
   They make pp the inspection force of FSIS - about 82 percent of
the agency's work force. Most of the FSIS budget goes for salaries.
   Total spending by FSIS was projected at about $440.9 million in
the 1991 fiscal year that begins Monday. A mandatory cutback under
the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law would lop off $143.3 million.
   The 32.4 percent across-the-board cuts in federal spending,
collectively called a sequester of funds, would require layoffs of
FSIS employees beginning Oct. 9, 10, 11 and 12.
   Much of the record 37.7 billion pounds of beef that will be
turned out by plants next year will be produced from cattle
slaughtered in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas.
   Huge poultry plants operate in Arkansas, Georgia, Maryland,
North Carolina and other states where broilers and turkeys are
produced. A record 33.7 billion pounds of poultry are expected next
year.
   ``We have some plants that operate two or three shifts a day,
and they would have maybe 20 inspectors per shift,'' Hudnall said
in an interview. ``We could have a single plant, counting all the
shifts, with 45 or 50, even 60 (FSIS) employees, but that would be
unusual.''
   ``We probably have 3,000 of our inspectors in 200 plants,''
Hudnall said. ``That means the other 4,500 people are spread among
the other 6,500 to 6,700 plants.''
   Most of these are processing plants that use meat and poultry to
make soup, stew, sausage and other items.
   Federal law dating back to the early years of the century
requires full-time, continuous inspection at all slaughtering
operations. Processing, however, is not required to be under
constant federal inspection.
   ``A lot of these are very, very small,'' Hudnall said. ``They
are one, two or three people that produce a regional sausage or
ethnic food - and they're scattered all over the place.''
   There have been money-saving sequesters before, but each time
Congress has provided supplemental appropriations to keep the
inspection services operating. But the one scheduled for October is
the biggest yet.
   If the layoffs are enforced to the hilt, Hudnall said they would
idle plants for ``over half the year.''
   The hardship on federal inspectors would be obvious. Slaughter
inspectors are paid $20,195 to $26,252 per year, he said.
Processing inspectors earn in the range of $24,705 to $32,121. Many
earn overtime, too, which is mainly paid for by the meat companies.

   Bond Corp Holdings Ltd. on Friday posted
Australia's largest annual corporate loss of $1.86 billion, two
days after financier Alan Bond's resignation.
   Bond Corp.'s deficit for the year ended June 30 included large
losses at Bell Resources Ltd. and at the G. Heileman Brewing Co.

previous year's deficit of $813 million.
   On Wednesday, Bond resigned as head of his holding company and
Peter Lucas was appointed chairman of the organization.
   Bond Corp. directors said Friday the results did not include the
profit from the disposal of Australian brewing assets to a joint
venture involving Bell Reources and New Zealand brewer Lion Nathan
Ltd.
   The loss included $348 million in Bond's Bell Resources
investments and $308 million in Heileman Brewing.

<HEAD>Government Clears Oil Companies Of Gasoline Price Fixing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Office of Fair Trading on Friday cleared five
oil companies of fixing gasoline pump prices in the face of rising
crude oil prices that followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The office's director general, Gordon Borrie, said the
industry's reaction to events in the Persian Gulf followed a
``pattern one would expect in a competitive market.''
   The office launched its inquiry Aug. 24 and asked for
information of price increases from the five major oil companies
operating in Britain: British Petroleum Co. PLC, Royal Dutch Shell
Group of Cos., Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Exxon Corp.
   Excess profits didn't appear to be generated at retail,
wholesale, or refining stages of the industry, Borrie said.
   He noted that increased demand since the Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait had generated ``windfall profits'' at the production stage.
   But he said it was a question of public policy, not competition
policy, whether moves should be made to moderate price rises or
redistribute windfalls.

   The stock market declined sharply in early
trading, extending the week's losses.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 43.82 points to
2,383.66 in the first half hour of trading. Losing issues
overwhelmed gainers by nearly 10 to 1 with 982 declining, 125
advancing and 329 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.50 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Many analysts considered the 2,400-level on the Dow a critical
floor. Piercing that at the start today means the key barometer has
shed 600 points, or lost 20 percent in value in the past six weeks.
   Marc Chandler, an analyst at IDEA, predicted that once the Dow
fell through 2,400, it would be ``off to the races,'' and many
investors headed for the security of the bond market. Others noted,
however, that investors might be tidying up their books since it is
the end of the quarter.
   More negative news was reported on the economic front, which

<HEAD>Municipal Investors Starting To Push Up Yields</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Municipal bond investors afraid financial
troubles like Philadelphia's may crop up elsewhere are beginning to
demand higher returns for their risk.
   But some analysts say the yields have to get higher to make it
worth investing in municipalities that face severe budget deficits,
particularly those in the slumping Northeast.
   For cities and states already strapped, higher yields raise the
cost of borrowing money.
   Massachusetts on Thursday had to offer yields as high as 7.97
percent for a $1.3 billion package of revenue bonds. That was about
1.5 percentage points higher than a Maryland offering earlier in
the week.
   The Massachusetts bonds were rated BBB by Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., while the Maryland issue got the highest AAA rating.
Massachusetts is running a budget deficit only two months into its
fiscal year.
   The so-called quality spread, which compares yields of
lower-rated municipal bonds to the highest rated, has been very
narrow recently, but is begining to widen, analysts say.
   Yields on 30-year A-rated revenue bonds are running 45 to 55
hundredths of a percentage point higher than the yields for
AAA-rated general obligation bonds, according to Municipal Market
Data Inc. The quality spreads are narrower for shorter-term issues.
   Investors ``concerns are legitimate in that quality spreads are
still so narrow that they're not getting paid for their credit
risk,'' said George Friedlander, municipal market analyst at Smith
Barney, Upham &amp; Co.
   Philadelphia's inability to sell about $375 million in
short-term notes and officials' predictions that the city will run
out of cash around Dec. 1, have prompted municipal bond investors
to begin focusing on credit quality.
   While the market continues to be driven by developments in the
Middle East, concern has been growing since early summer over how
budget deficits and recession, which cuts into tax revenues, would
affect the ability of cities and states to make debt payments.
   ``We have been concerned about the trend in a lot of state and
local governments asked to bear a larger share of entitlements and
other programs required by the federal government, while at same
time revenue counted on to pay for the programs is not there,''
said Neal Atterman, municipal research director at Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co.
   The stock price of MBIA, a major municipal bond insurer, has
been particularly hard hit by the worries over credit quality. The
stock last week sunk to around $25 from about $37 the week before.
   Many investors feel MBIA is heavily exposed to Philadelphia's
debt and could suffer if Philadelphia defaults. However, the
company said exposure to Philadelphia debt is not excessive and
Standard &amp; Poor's affirmed MBIA's AAA rating.
   Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service Inc., have
lowered their ratings on Philadelphia's general obligation bonds,
which are backed by the city's faith and credit. S&amp;P ranks the
bonds at CCC and Moody's puts them at B, giving the debt junk-bond
status.
   General obligation bonds are usually viewed as more secure than
revenue bonds, which depend on user fees such as bridge tolls to
make payments.
   However, some are beginning to look at selected revenue bonds as
more recession-proof since it has been Philadelphia's general
obligation bonds that are considered to be the larger credit risk.
   ``We've been of the philosophy that some are better off with a
set revenue stream. People are still going to pay tolls in a
recession,'' said Nicole Anderes, head of municipal research at New
York-based Roosevelt &amp; Cross Inc., an investment firm that focuses
on Northeast municipalities.
   Some see the chances of Pennsylvania allowing its largest city
to default as slim and point out that investors who held on to
their bonds during the fiscal crises in New York and Cleveland
during the 1970s survived intact.
   For the investor who could survive a long period of illiquidity,
it might be worth the risk, some say.
   Steven J. Hueglin, executive vice president at Gabriele, Hueglin
&amp; Cashman Inc., says Philadelphia's bonds are a good speculative
investment, particularly the general obigation issue.

<HEAD>Soybean, Wheat Slightly Higher, Corn Unchanged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and wheat futures opened slightly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn was unchanged.
   Early support for soybeans followed yesterday's late release of
the Agriculture Department's quarterly report on the estimated
stockpile of grains in the United States.
   The report found a slightly lower than expected number of
soybeans in this year's harvest. Forecasts of rain in the Midwest
this weekend, where soybeans are grown, also helped drive prices
up.
   Wheat prices rose slightly also on the USDA report of an
unexpectedly small harvest in that grain. Speculation that the
Soviet Union will eventually buy some wheat flour under a
subsidized program also drove prices higher.
   Corn was unchanged as nearly ideal weather conditions for
harvest remained in the region.
   Nervousness about early trading on the New York stock market
later eroded much of the opening support for wheat, soybeans and
corn.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ to 2 cents lower with
contracts for delivery in December at $2.76\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.28 a bushel; oats
are 2} to 3\ cents higher with December at $1.19\ a bushel;
soybeans are 1} cents to 3} cents lower with November at $6.17 a
bushel.
   Live and feeder cattle futures were mostly lower, hog futures
were mostly higher and pork bellies were mixed in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .23 cent to .10 cent lower with October
at 78.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .10
cent higher with October at 86.70 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent
to .30 cent higher with October at 54.07 cents a pound; pork
bellies were .05 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at
57.60 cents a pound.
   Live cattle settled Thursday .07 cent to .55 cent higher with
October at 79 cents; feeder cattle settled .05 cent lower to .72
cent higher with September at 89.35 cents a pound; hogs settled .40
cent to .22 cent lower with October at 53.85 cents a pound; pork
bellies settled .55 to 1.17 cents higher with October at 57.37
cents a pound.

   The stock market recovered from early losses
today as financial issues stemmed their recent plunge and bargain
hunters surfaced.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 8.92 points at
2,418.56 at midday. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by about 9 to
4 with 945 declining, 426 advancing and 457 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 100.47 million shares at noon on
Wall Street, against 88.56 million at the same time Thursday.
   The Dow plunged nearly 50 points, piercing the 2,400-level
shortly after the opening bell and then regained its footing at
mixed levels. Many analysts considered the 2,400 mark a critical

<TEXT>
   Midway Airlines began cutting 500 people from its
workforce today, and blamed rising fuel costs as the cause.
   Chicago-based Midway also said it would end service to Savannah,
Ga., on Nov. 1 and reduce its service to 11 other cities beginning
Oct. 15.
   ``These actions are necessitated by escalating fuel costs
brought on by the Persian Gulf crisis,'' Midway Chairman David
Hinson said in a statement.
   ``Midway, as well as other airlines, is actively addressing the
need to adjust system flying in order to reduce operating costs and
produce a better balance between capacity and passenger demand,''
Hinson said.
   The reduction will affect 10 percent of Midway's work force,
said spokeswoman Sandra Allen.
   She said most of the 500 positions will be eliminated through
layoffs that will be phased in through Nov. 1. Some jobs will be
eliminated by not filling positions vacated during the past several
weeks, Allen said.
   She said all departments in the company will be affected but
declined to release specific numbers.
   Hinson said Midway also plans to withdraw eight of its least
fuel efficient aircraft from its fleet and replace them with more
efficient MD-80 jetliners made by McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   He said Midway took delivery of three MD-80s this month and
expects to receive four more by year end.
   Midway Airlines and Midway Commuter serve 59 cities in the
United States, Canada, the Virgin Islands and the Bahamas.
   The airline has major hubs in Chicago and Philadelphia.

   The dollar finished lower against other major
currencies in Europe today after drifting in generally thin and
lackluster trading.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The dollar traded narrowly throughout the day, as did most other

   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 137.95 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 138.15 yen. The dollar traded at
138.29 yen at around midday in New York.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $404.75 a troy ounce from

<HEAD>Non-Union Coal Companies Opposing Health Plan Bailout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to rescue two United Mine Workers health
care funds, now staggering under an $88 million deficit, are
stirring anxiety among non-union coal operators.
   The operators fear a new industry-wide coal tax will be proposed
to bail out the troubled 1950 and 1974 UMW health benefit trusts,
which serve 127,052 retired union miners, widows and dependents.
   ``That's the big buzzword this week in the industry, a growing
feeling that (non-union companies) may have to pay something,''
said Marc Cohen, coal analyst for Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
   In March, U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed an
11-member commission to study the trusts. The panel, which has no
lawmaking power, will release its recommendations at two meetings,
scheduled for Oct. 11 and Oct. 17 in Washington.
   Henry Perritt, vice chairman of the commission, said Thursday
there's been no decision on financing the trusts' rescue but
indicated some type of industrywide financing is being considered.
   ``There is fairly strong evidence that the problem of health
care obligation for retirees can't be solved in the long run
without some kind of broadening of the financing obligations,''
said Perritt.
   The panel also is looking at ways to improve the delivery of
health care services to retirees, said Perritt.
   ``My hope is, we'll be able to put together a whole package to
address the financing side and address the care delivery side that
takes advantage of the thinking that's being expressed in the
national dialogue on health care policy,'' said Perritt.
   The panel will hold the last in a series of public hearings Oct.
10 in Washington, where the coal tax issue is expected to dominate
discussions.
   Mrs. Dole formed the commission on the heels of the UMW's
10{-month strike against the Pittston Co. The strike was triggered
in part when the company stopped paying into the funds; Pittston
said the payments hurt its competitiveness in the export market.
   Pittston settled with the union and contributed a $10 million
lump-sum payment into the 1950 health fund.
   The 1950 and 1974 funds are financed by coal companies that sign
the national UMW labor agreement, known as the Bituminous Coal
Operators Association contract.
   But there are fewer BCOA companies to uupport the health plan
than needed to keep it in the black. About half of the industry's
work force are union members.
   Now the 1950 fund faces a $73 million deficit while the 1974
fund is $15 million in debt.
   Other problems include the high cost of health care and a
federal lawsuit alleging mismanagement of the fund. The funds are
separate from the union and are operated by independent trustees.
   The funds' dilemma has delayed payments for health care services
in the coalfields. Retirees and their families have problems
finding drugstores that accept the UMWA health plan card.
   Earlier this month, eight non-union coal companies protested the
rumored bailout plan in a letter to Labor Secretary Dole.
   ``It would be an unprecedented projection of federal power into
labor management relations in this country to require union-free
companies to pay for benefits available only to union members,''
the letter said. It was signed by officials for Quaker Coal Co.;
Shell Mining Co.; Mapco Coal Co.; Addington Resources; Coastal
Energy Co.; Arco Coal Co.; Kerr-McGee Coal Corp.; and Santa Fe
Pacific Coal Corp.
   ``Forcing non-involved companies to pick up the bill for
parties' failure to confront their economic problems in collective
bargaining would establish an inappropriate and potentially
catastrophic public policy,'' the letter said.
   One probable solution is transferring money from the union's fat
pension fund to bail out the health trust. Last year, the 1950 and
1974 pension trusts showed $5.17 billion in assets after
subtracting liabilities, according to UMW documents.
   Last year, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., introduced a bill
allowing transfer of money from the overfunded pension trusts to

<HEAD>Survival Eastern's Major Accomplishment, But Even That's In Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Shugrue was telling a campus audience the
other day that his ``100 Days'' campaign at Eastern was a victory.
   ``What victory?'' shouted one of the striking Eastern Machinists
union members who joined students for Shugrue's speech at Florida
International University.
   ``Survival, dear friend. Survival,'' was Shugrue's answer.
   But even that minimal accomplishment is in doubt as an airline
industry downturn, steepened by soaring oil prices, worsens
Eastern's viability.
   ``It's worse because everybody's worse,'' said Robert Joedicke,
airline analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``There's no way
you can make up the immediate rise in fuel prices.''
   Jet fuel prices have soared since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2,
driving up the cost of oil. The major airlines have increased fares
- some of them twice - but with passenger traffic already sluggish,
they can't raise them to match the higher fuel costs.
   For Eastern, things are even worse. ``Like most carriers,
they're between the rock and the hard place,'' Joedicke said. Not
only that, the airline was already in a financial bind that's ``a
hard thing to carry on.''
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 1{ years ago
and has seen operating losses continue at more than $2 million a
day. Its second-quarter operating loss was $234.4 million and
Shugrue has indicated third-quarter results won't be comforting for
increasingly nervous creditors.
   Shugrue this week expressed frustration about the impact of the
Persian Gulf crisis, which has increased Eastern's fuel costs from
56 cents a gallon to 96 cents. It came, he said, as the airline was
making progress.
   In August, its load capacity was 72 percent. Eastern was showing
its strongest signs of progress since it began rebuilding from the
crippling March 4, 1989, strike led by Machinists and joined by
pilots and flight attendants after years of labor-management
tension.
   The company also recently announced a major push to draw
business travelers by offering special rates, expanded first-class
cabins, and amenities like airphones for every seat to a better
wine list. Eastern also unveiled special flights to winter vacation
destinations for frequent fliers.
   While industry analysts saw the efforts as good long-term
strategy, doubts have risen about whether Eastern has a long term.
   Shugrue said Eastern would need to fly at 102 percent capacity
to break even at current fuel prices. He asked for presidential
intervention, such as President Bush's announcement this week to
draw on the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve of crude oil.
   A former pilot and veteran airline executive, Shugrue says he's
against industry ``re-regulation'' or government involvement in
corporate affairs.
   But, he added, ``Forces outside our control must be managed by a
higher authority.''
   ``Someone has to evaluate the present situation and develop some
guidelines to ... stanch the flow of corporate blood, restore
jobs,'' Shugrue said.
   ``This could be the script, sometime in the foreseesable future
in early 199 maybe - U.S. air traffic shared by only four carriers
... all other airlines have fallen to the wayside,'' he said.
   Shugrue argued that the ``mega-carrier'' scenario has serious
national implications. The giant carriers would focus their quest
for riches abroad, he said, and fares for U.S. consumers would
skyrocket while travel choices decreased.
   Meanwhile, industrywide problems may reduce Eastern's
alternatives. A long-discussed merger with Continental seems
unlikely, analysts say, and while Eastern and Northwest Airlines
have been talking, the tightening market probably would make it
difficult for Northwest to afford a takeover.
   Eastern is dependent upon Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland's
willingness to allow continued draws on an escrow account to keep
it operating. On Thursday, he authorized the release of $50
million.
   The judge has made clear he wants to make sure Eastern has had
every chance to stay alive and preserve the jobs of 17,000
employees.
   Analysts expect the judge to give Eastern's corporate fare
strategy, which begins Monday, time to work.
   ``The judge wants to give Eastern as much time as possible,''
said Ray Neidl of Dillon Read &amp; Co. ``So even if the unsecured
creditors step up their lobbying for liquidation, if Eastern can
show some progress, that can be diffused. But the clock is
ticking.''

   House Speaker Thomas Foley said today that
although congressional and White House bargainers are near a $500
billion budget deal, disputes remain that leave wide-scale slashes
in federal programs looming for Monday.
   ``There are some remaining issues that are very difficult that
remain to be resolved,'' said Foley, D-Wash.
   Negotiators, still divided over whether to impose new taxes on
the wealthy and other issues, planned to meet through the weekend
if necessary in hopes of agreeing to a package. Congress planned a
rare Sunday session to deal with the fiscal crisis.
   More than four months of talks have brought tentative agreements
to cut defense and domestic programs and raise the government's
take on items ranging from gasoline to Medicare premiums, officials
familiar with the talks said Thursday.
   But at nearly 1:30 a.m. today, negotiators broke for the evening
saying they could not yet shake hands on a pact.
   ``So close and yet we're not quite there,'' said House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., as he and other bargainers ended
their back-room meeting in the Capitol.
   The major question remained whether Democrats would finally
agree to a reduction in the capital gains tax - a longtime demand
of President Bush - and which levies on the wealthy would be
boosted to compensate.
   ``We're still working on all of that,'' said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Without a budget deal, federal drug agents, food and drug
inspectors and many of the government's 2.1 million civilian
workers faced furloughs beginning Monday.
   The lack of an agreement would trigger $85 billion in spending
cuts. Social Security, soldiers' salaries and many initiatives for
the poor are exempted, but most federal programs faced immediate
budget slashes of about one-third.
   At the talks, Republicans were willing to abandon the
president's insistence to lower the rates of the capital gains tax,
which is charged against the profits of property sales, officials
said.
   Instead, they were willing to leave current rates alone and
exempt from the levy increases in the value of an asset due to
inflation.
   But insistent that most benefits of the tax cut would go to the
wealthy, Democrats were holding out for a counter-balancing tax
increase on the well-to-do.
   Several options were under consideration, including raising tax
rates on the richest Americans and limiting their deductions.
   A rate increase would represent a significant political victory
for Democrats over Bush, whose 1988 campaign is best remembered for
his chant of ``No new taxes.''
   The two sides have tentatively agreed to hold defense spending
to $170 billion below the amount it would need to stay even with
inflation over the next five years, including a $10 billion cut
next year.
   The growth of benefit programs would be slowed by $120 billion,
half of it coming from Medicare.
   Participants in the program, which provides health care to 33
million elderly and disabled people, would bear half the cuts. Much
of the savings would come from a $5.70 increase in the $28.60
payment they make monthly for doctors' coverage. Doctors and
hospitals would have to swallow the other half of the Medicare
reductions.
   Over five years, support payments to farmers would be cut $12
billion and benefits for civil servants would drop by $14 billion.
   Although not yet agreed to, it appeared likely that Social
Security recipients would be hit for $20 billion in savings, either
by having cost-of-living increases delayed or the taxes on their
benefits increased.
   Tax increases tentatively set were an 8-cent-per-gallon increase
in the federal gasoline levy, already at 9 cents; a separate tax on
all fuels based on their energy content; and a 10 percent tax on
luxury items including yachts, furs and jewelry.
   Democrats would like to boost the income tax rate on the
wealthiest Americans above its current 28 percent. People who fall
just below the top bracket must pay taxes of 33 percent, and
Democrats would like to increase the top rate to at least 31
percent, officials said.
   As an alternative, they are considering a plan limiting the
deductions people who earn above $100,000 can claim to 90 or 95
percent of what they would otherwise be entitled.
   Democrats also have proposed lifting the earnings ceiling above
which Medicare taxes are not taken out of paychecks.
   As part of Social Security withholding, people now pay a 1.45
percent tax to support Medicare on earnings up to $51,300 per year.
They pay nothing on money they earn above that amount. Under the
proposal, that ceiling would be lifted to $65,000 or $75,000.

<HEAD>House Passes Market Reform-Program Trading Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stock market reform bill expanding the
Securities and Exchange Commission's powers to monitor major Wall
Street players and intervene during stock market emergencies was
passed unanimously by the House on Friday.
   The bill was approved on a voice vote.
   House passage of the Market Reform Act of 1990, which the Senate
approved on Tuesday, sends the bill to the White House for
President Bush's signature.
   The bill was agreed upon after a month of discussions between
House and Senate staffers. It will allow the SEC to regulate
program trading - the controversial computer-driven trading
strategy - during times of extreme market turbulence.
   In addition, the compromise market reform bill contains
provisions passed separately by both the House and Senate earlier
this year.
   One expands the authority of the SEC chairman to shut down the
securities markets, with presidential permission, in times of
market emergency. Previously only the president could order a
trading halt.
   Other provisions:
   - Require large securities traders to report their market
positions to the SEC.
   - Mandate coordinated clearance and settlement of stocks,
options and futures contracts between the SEC and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.
   - Require the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, the
CFTC and SEC to report annually to Congress on their efforts to
protect the integrity of the markets.
   - Give the SEC authority to assess the financial health of the
parent holding companies of broker-dealers.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the one-time junk bond giant of
Wall Street, collapsed in February after the failure of its parent
holding company, which SEC officials have complained they had no
authority to monitor.
   The original House version, the Securities Markets Reform Act
passed in June, contained a provision giving the SEC authority to
limit program trading ``during periods of extraordinary market
volatility'' - the sharp climbs or drops in stock prices.
   The original Senate version, the Market Reform Act which passed
last month, did not have a program trading provision.
   Critics of program trading, the rapid-fire transactions through
computerized buy and sell programs of enormous blocks of stocks,
blame it for worsening the 1987 stock market crash and the
190-point market drop last Oct. 13.
   They are especially critical of one form of program trading,
index arbitrage, in which speculators try to take advantage of
small, brief price differences between the stock and futures
markets by simultaneously buying large orders in one market while
selling in the other.
   The version passed by the Senate narrowed slightly the scope of
the SEC's authority. It gives the SEC rulemaking authority to
prohibit during times of ``extraordinary market volatility any
trading practice'' in securities that the agency previously has
found ``contributed significantly'' to the threat to orderly
markets or ``is reasonably certain'' to do so.

   The stock market recovered from early losses
today as financial issues stemmed their recent plunge and bargain
hunters surfaced.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 1.24 at 2,426.24
at midafternoon. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by about 12 to 7
with 916 declining, 540 advancing and 450 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 135.20 million shares at 2 p.m.
on Wall Street.
   The Dow plunged nearly 50 points, piercing the 2,400-level
shortly after the opening bell as many big Japanese investors sold
stocks. With prices falling sharply overnight in Tokyo and with the
first half of Japan's fiscal year drawing to a close, many Japanese
investors wanted to take their money home, noted Michael Metz, a
vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Several analysts considered the 2,400 mark on the Dow a critical
floor. Sinking beneath that level meant the key barometer had lost
600 points, or lost 20 percent in value from its peak six weeks
ago.
   Nervous investors headed for the security of the bond market or
moved money into cash in a trend being felt worldwide. But stock
prices bounced higher and neared the previous day's closing level
amid bargain hunting and higher prices in the banking sector.
   More negative news was reported on the economic front, which
weighed on the market. The government said its index of leading
indicators sank 1.2 percent in August, the steepest drop in three
years.
   The pressure eased slightly on bank stocks, which have been
hammered for days, and that helped pick the market up from its
worst levels. Citicorp was up &rsqb; at 14&lsqb;; Manufacturers Hanover was
up 1{ at 21}; Chemical Bank was up ~ at 15 and Chase Manhattan
gained | at 11|.

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
inched up 0.31 to 165.67. At the American Stock Exchange, the
marketvvalue index stood at 304.32, off 1.11.

   Switzerland's flag carrier Swissair
on Friday announced it will buy 26 new aircraft made by the
European Airbus consortium in preference to ones made by McDonnell
Douglas Corp.
   The company said it had taken out options on an additional 26
Airbus machines to replace its aging short-haul fleet of MD-81s.
   A statement said the investment was worth the equivalent of
about $1.8 billion, the largest in Swissair's 60-year history.
   The statement said the firm order consisted of seven A320s, with
a 133-seat capacity, and nineteen 170-seat A321s. It said the first
of these would be delivered in January 1995 and the last in March
1998.
   The company described the Airbus aircraft as ``particularly easy
on the environment.''
   Airbus is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm of West Germany, British Aerospace and
Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain.
   The decision was made at a Swissair board meeting in Zurich.
   Also at the meeting, Hannes Goetz, chief executive of the Swiss
company Georg Fischer AG, was named as Swissair's new board
chairman.
   The appointment, which must be approved by the shareholders,
would become effective in April 1992 when current chairman Armin
Baltensweiler is due to retire.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures fell and grains were mixed at the
close of thin, quiet trading Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans opened with early support following yesterday's
after-closing release of the Agriculture Department's quarterly
report on the estimated stockpile of grains in the United States.
But that support quickly eroded amid pressure from the upcoming
expected better-than-normal harvest and little export demand,
analysts said.
   Traders had expected slight gains in the soybean and grain
markets Friday but were surprised by lackluster trading, said David
Armstrong, an analyst for AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington.
   ``The (USDA) report obviously wasn't enough to bring any new
buying, and there wasn't any bad news to bring a lot of selling,''
Armstrong said.
   Wheat futures also opened slightly higher but fell on
professional selling and continued questions about whether the
Soviet Union will accept a government offer to buy subsidized wheat
flour.
   Corn suffered from minimal near-term export demand and the
approach of active harvesting.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to { cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.78 a bushel; corn
futures were { cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.28 a
bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 five cents higher with December at

   The stock market recovered from an early plunge
and advanced today as investors were lured by bargain-basement
prices.
   The gain was led largely by blue-chip issues and higher prices
in the banking sector, where stocks had been hammered for days. The
broader market, however, remained mixed.
   The session began on a sour note. The Dow Jones industrial
average plunged nearly 50 points, piercing the 2,400-level shortly

   Economic worries intensified the market's recent slide, pushing
the Dow Jones industrial average below the 2,500 mark to levels not
seen since May 1989. The Dow's 12 percent erosion since the first
of the year was persuading many experts that a bear market had
arrived.
   The damage was even more severe in Tokyo, where the Nikkei
average of Japanese stocks suffered more huge losses on concerns
about the Gulf and Japan's own banking sector.
   The Nikkei average, off more than 45 percent on the year,
dropped below the depths reached in the 1987 market crash.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Barely Perceptible Growth</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The economic news from Washington was not encouraging. A report
on the gross national product showed the economy virtually ground
to a halt in the second quarter, growing a mere 0.4 percent.
   The National Association of Business Economists, usually an
optimistic group, said more than half of the professional
forecasters surveyed in late August and early September believed a
recession already had begun or was around the corner.
   The government said its own economic forecasting gauge sank 1.2
percent in August, the steepest drop in nearly three years.
   A study from the Conference Board, a business lobby group, said
consumer confidence in August remained at its lowest level since
the 1982 recession.

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Milken Faces the Music</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Deposed junk-bond king Michael Milken returned to the headlines
as the government and his defense lawyers prepared to play out the
final chapter of his story in open court.
   Milken was due to be sentenced Monday on the six felony counts
to which he pleaded guilty in April. But U.S. District Judge Kimba
Wood put off the sentencing after being inundated with hundreds of
pages of documents from both the prosecution and defense painting
starkly different portraits of the financier.
   Prosecutors alleged a broad pattern of wrongdoing by Milken well
beyond the crimes he admitted, and they urged the judge to impose a
stiff prison sentence.
   The defense refuted the additional allegations and described
Milken as a generous, warm human being who should work with ghetto
youth, not go to jail.
   The judge also received hundreds of letters from members of the
public, split along the same lines.
   Postponing the sentencing would allow time for a special hearing
early in October to determine the real Milken. Ivan Boesky,
Milken's chief accuser, could be called to testify.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: A Deal For MCA Emerges</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The stock of entertainment giant MCA Inc. shot up in response to
a reported merger deal with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   Trading around $34 before the news broke, MCA shares climbed to
near $60 in anticipation of the offer, which could bring between
$70 and $90 per share.
   In addition to making MCA stockholders rich, the proposed $7
billion acquisition would combine two top players in entertainment
hardware and software.
   The combination would mirror one established when Sony Corp.
bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment for $5 billion last year.
   While the idea revived concerns about Japanese purchases of
valuable U.S. assets, the deal looked good for both sides. Analysts
said both needed to grow to compete against Sony and Time Warner
Inc., two of the biggest competitors in the field.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, struggling to
maintain central control over Soviet political and economic life,
plans to transform 550 armament factories to civilian production,
his spokesman said Friday.
   Gorbachev and top aides met to complete the conversion plan as
representatives of seven Soviet republics agreed to bypass central
authorities in working out a new system of economic and political
cooperation.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament has been unable to pass a cohesive
reform plan, and on Monday granted Gorbachev extraordinary powers
to transform the national economy from a planned to a market
system.
   Representatives of nine of the 15 Soviet republics and the mayor
of Leningrad, dissatisfied with Gorbachev's reforms, met in the
Estonian capital of Tallinn and signed a protocol establishing an
Economic Consultative Committee to coordinate their own shift to a
market economy.
   Gorbachev's plan to shift hundreds of defense plants to civilian
production appeared designed to quell fears of a military
resurgence and to assure people the central government was acting
to meet consumer demands.
   Presidential spokesman Vitaly N. Ignatenko told reporters that
Gorbachev was meeting late Friday with members of the advisory
Presidential Council to cement plans to shift arms plants to the
production of processed food, medicine, electronics and other goods
desperately needed in the faltering Soviet economy.
   The 550 factories would be converted in stages over the next
five years to produce 270 billion rubles ($472.5 billion) worth of
goods for civilian use from 1990 through 1995, twice the level as
during the previous five-year period, Ignatenko told a briefing.
   On Thursday, Gorbachev issued his first decree under the
enhanced powers, threatening businesses with fines if they did not
fulfill supply contracts to government retailers.
   Ignatenko denied that ordering businesses to meet the contracts
contradicted Gorbachev's stated intent of transforming the nation.
   The measures, Ignatenko said, ``are designed to stabilize the
situation and move to a market economy as soon as possible. They do
not mean that Mr. Gorbachev has rejected his own ideas.''
   Gorbachev, meeting in the Kremlin with the chairman of the
General Electric Corp., Jack Welch, acknowledged that ``the Soviet
Union is living through a dramatic, tough, but creative time.''
   ``The Soviet people understand the need to radicalize the
economic reform, revitalize finances, change the forms and types of
property ownership and move to market mechanisms,'' the state news
agency Tass quoted Gorbachev as telling Welch.
   Representatives of nine Soviet republics met in Tallinn to find
a way to speed the reforms. All but two Soviet republics, including
the Russian Federation, have declared some form of sovereignty from
central authorities since March, and the protocol affirmed the
right of the republics to chart their own political and economic
course.
   But the protocol echoed one aspect of the decree Gorbachev
issued Thursday, directing republics to ``maintain existing
economic ties for he period of transition to the market...''
   Signing the protocol were officials from Russia, the largest and
wealthiest republic, the three Baltic republics of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia, as well as Armenia, Kirghizia, and Moldavia,
the Estonian news agency reported.
   Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak also attended, the reports said.
Leningrad is the second largest Soviet city. Representatives from
Tadzhikistan and Byelorussia attended the session but did not sign
the protocol, it said.
   The three Baltic republics have said they will not sign the new
union treaty that Gorbachev is preparing to unite the republics
into a loose confederation.
   The protocol signed Friday expressed support for efforts by the
republics to negotiate bilateral economic, political and cultural
treaties bypassing the central government.

   The Mexican government's foreign debt has
increased because of the Persian Gulf crisis, nearly wiping out any
additional revenue from increased crude oil exports, the newspaper
El Financiero reported Friday.
   Treasury Department documents say the debt shot up by $1.1
billion to $75.6 billion since Aug. 2, mostly because of the drop
of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and Western European
currencies.
   The bulk of Mexico's foreign trade and debt is carried out in
U.S. dollars, while an estimated 21.5 percent is in non-dollar
currencies, the newspaper said.
   Service on the debt will increase by $101 million this year
because of rising interest rates, El Financiero said.
   Mexico increased its crude oil exports by 100,000 barrels a day
to 1.325 million barrels to help make up for the shortage caused by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   The dollar gained against all major currencies
except its Canadian counterpart in unusually slow U.S. trading
Friday after moving mostly lower overseas.
   Gold prices posted minor losses and gains in world trading.
   The dollar traded within a narrow band on domestic and foreign
markets.
   The typically light volume that ordinarily occurs on Fridays was
curtailed even further by the approaching end to the month,
calendar year quarter and half of Japan's fiscal year. All three
occur Sunday.
   The start of the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday, which began at
sundown Friday, also lightened liquidity because some dealers left
work early.
   Traders were reluctant to stake out significant new positions
and institutional currency investors were finishing up seasonal
paperwork.
   What buying there was in the dollar reflected traders' hedging
against a possible escalation in the Middle East conflict over the
weekend. The dollar is traditionally considered a safe investment
haven at times of international turmoil.
   Financial markets regarded the latest U.S. economic reading
merely as confirmation of what has been widely known for some time.
The Commerce Department report on the government's chief economic
forecasting gauge had virtually no lasting impact on the dollar.
   The Index of Leading Indicators tumbled 1.2 percent in August,
its steepest fall in three years. It was viewed as another signal
of a possible recession ahead for the United States.
   The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen in Tokyo where
another selloff on the stock market chipped away confidence in the
country's currency.
   The dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 137.95 yen in the Japanese
capital. Later in London, it was quoted at 138.15 yen and at 138.50
yen late in New York, up from 137.98 yen late Thursday.
   The British pound rose in London and traded at $1.8735 late in
the session, compared to $1.8690 late Thursday. But the pound lost
ground in New York activity and was quoted late in the day at
$1.8760 vs. $1.8780 late Thursday.
   Other dollar rates late in New York, compared with Thursday's
late quotes included: 1.5670 German marks, up from 1.5610; 2.29735
Swiss francs; up from 1.2925; 5.2455 French francs, up from 5.2250;
1,173.25 Italian lire, up from 1,169.25; and 1.15425 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.15495.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with Thursday's
late levels, were: 1.5655 German marks, down from 1.5685; 1.2980
Swiss francs, down from 1.3055; 5.2420 French francs, down from
5.2555; 1.7655 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7695; 1,172.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,175.50; and 1.1563 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1573.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for October
delivery settled at $402.50 a troy ounce, down $2.50 from
Thursday's close. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late
gold bid of $403 an ounce, $2 lower than Thursday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid of $404.75 a troy ounce from
$405.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid
of $406.25 from $406 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.10
to close at $403.39 an ounce.
   Silver prices fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
October delivery settled at $4.761 a troy ounce compared to the
Thursday settlement price of $4.771. The metal fell in London to a
late bid of $4.79 a troy ounce from Thursday's $4.80.

<TEXT>
   After nearly four years of government and public
scrutiny, a shattered career and a humiliating guilty plea in Wall
Street's worst scandal, Michael Milken thought he had neared
judgment day.
   But Milken's legal rite of reckoning in a Manhattan federal
courtroom on Monday was postponed for reasons that could be either
ominous or fortunate for the 44-year-old prince of junk-bond
financing.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood decided late last week to
delay sentencing and hold an extraordinary hearing into numerous
allegations of criminal conduct by Milken that extend far beyond
his six admitted felonies of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud and aiding and abetting tax fraud.
   She said the hearing, likely to take place in mid-October, would
help her better understand whether Milken's crimes were aberrant as
the defense has claimed or systematic as alleged by the government.
   Wood is relatively new to the bench but widely acclaimed for
careful handling of her first nationally prominent criminal
sentencing. Faced with mountains of documents from both sides of
the case, painting widely divergent pictures of the accused, she
chose to solicit more information.
   The hearing she has proposed presents formidable new hurdles for
each side. The government will have to lay out its evidence that
Milken was not only a crook, but an unrepentant one. Milken's
lawyers will be put in the uncomfortable position of deflecting
those punches in a public forum, which is something they had hoped
to avoid.
   ``The purpose is not to establish whether a defendant is guilty
of every unadmitted defense. That is precisely the opportunity the
government chooses to forego when it accepts a guilty plea to fewer
than all of the alleged crimes,'' Wood told the lawyers for both
sides at a pre-sentence hearing.
   ``Rather, the purpose of considering unadmitted conduct is to
give the court a sense of the defendant's character as it is
reflected in his conduct.'' Wood's decision seemed to catch the
prosecution and defense by surprise as it tossed them into vaguely
charted legal waters. It also left unresolved the final chapter of
the tortuous Milken story, which began after Ivan Boesky pleaded
guilty to securities fraud in November 1986 and put the government
on the trail of the Drexel Burnham Lambert junk-bond wizard.
   Some lawyers even suggested the hearing raised the remote
possibility that Milken, who tearfully pleaded guilty to the six
counts in April after insisting he was innocent of any wrongdoing,
would scrap that deal and gamble anew on a full-blown jury trial.
   ``Obviously the hearing is going to complicate things,'' said
Harry First, a New York University law school expert on
white-collar crime. ``I think this is fairly uncharted stuff.''
   Others said it was the first time a judge in a white-collar case
had ordered what is known in legal circles as a Fatico hearing. It
is named after Carmine Fatico, a truck hijacker who was sentenced
partly on the basis of a hearing into an uncharged crime: his
alleged membership in the Mafia.
   ``If the government wants the judge to consider something you
weren't convicted of, the defense has a right to challenge it,''
said lawyer Thomas Puccio, a former assistant U.S. attorney who
prosecuted the Fatico case. ``That's what the hearing is for.''
   If Wood were to conclude Milken engaged in a pattern of
cheating, bribery, insider trading and obstruction of justice from
the junk-bond trading desk at Drexel, as the prosecution alleged in
its sentencing memorandum, she would likely order a fairly harsh
sentence.
   On the other hand, if she found him the benign, generous
philanthropist depicted by the defense, she'd be more inclined to
give him a relatively mild punishment.
   In any case, Wood cannot order Milken imprisoned for more than
the 28-year maximum on the six counts in his plea. Many lawyers
have said she might sentence him to far less even if she believed
elements of the prosecutors' portrayal, because he has promised to
cooperate in other probes.
   Milken is the biggest figure to fall in the securities fraud
scandals of the '80s, as measured by his prominence and the record
$600 million in fines and penalties he agreed to pay in his plea
bargain.
   By contrast, Boesky paid $100 million, pleaded guilty to one
count and received a three-year term. Investment banker Dennis B.
Levine got two years imprisonment and a $362,000 fine for insider
trading; mergers specialist Martin A. Siegel received a two-month
prison term, 3,000 hours of community service and five years
probation.
   Some legal experts interpreted Wood's decision to hold a special
hearing as a sign that she found little to guide her toward a fair
sentence from either the defense or the prosecution.
   Prosecutors implied Milken should get at least six times the
punishment of Boesky since he paid six times the fine and admitted
six times the crimes.
   Wood seemed to reject that implication at the pre-sentencing
hearing last week.
   But she seemed no more persuaded by the defense's testimonials
from people ranging from Milken's childhood math teacher to the Los
Angeles police chief, beseeching her to view Milken as a contrite
first-time offender who didn't care much about money and gave most
of it away. Milken's defenders urged her to spare him from prison
and let him work with inner-city children.
   What ultimately may arise from Wood's special hearing, legal
experts say, is the first substantive look at the true strength of
the government's case against Milken had it gone to trial.
   ``I applaud what she did,'' said John Coffee, a Columbia Law
School professor who has been following Milken's case.
   ``Now we're really going to get to that truth-finding function
that the criminal justice system is designed for,'' he said.
``We're going to have people tell us what happened.''

<TEXT>
   Here is a chronology of key developments in the prosecution of
former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond chief Michael Milken:
   Nov. 14, 1986 - Stock speculator Ivan Boesky pays $100 million
to settle charges of insider trading on information supplied by
investment banker Dennis Levine. He agrees to cooperate with
investigators and plead guilty to a single criminal charge. Boesky
later is sentenced to three years in prison.
   Late 1986 - Published reports link Milken to an illegal insider
trading network led by Boesky.
   Sept. 7, 1988 - The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses
Drexel, Milken and three others of violating a wide range of
securities laws, most in connection with Boesky.
   Dec. 21 - Drexel agrees to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
a record $650 million in fines and restitution to settle the
biggest securities fraud probe in history.
   March 29, 1989 - A federal grand jury indicts Milken, brother
Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg on 98 counts of
racketeering and fraud largely based on information supplied by
Boesky. Potential penalties and fines total $12 billion plus
possible prison terms.
   April 7 - The Milkens plead innocent. Newberg enters an innocent
plea later.
   April 13 - Drexel and the SEC announce a settlement of the civil
fraud case that subjects the firm to federal monitoring for three
years and forces it to sever ties with Milken.
   June 15 - Milken resigns after 19 years at Drexel to form his
own consulting firm. Lowell Milken quits to return to practicing
law.
   Sept. 11 - Drexel formally pleads guilty to six felonies and
begins paying its fine.
   Feb. 13, 1990 - Drexel's parent company files for federal
bankruptcy court protection after defaulting on debts and begins
laying off employees.
   March 19 - Prosecutors promise to bring a new indictment with
broader charges against Milken by the week of April 16.
   April 4 - Boesky is released from federal custody after
completing two years of a three-year term.
   April 19 - Four months of negotiations intensify between the
government and Milken for a possible plea bargain to settle the
case as a deadline looms for the new indictment.
   April 24 - Milken pleads guilty to six felonies including
conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and assisting in the
filing of a false tax return, carrying a total maximum sentence of
28 years imprisonment. Four of the counts directly involve Boesky.
Milken also agrees to pay $600 million in restitution and fines and
cooperate with the government after sentencing, set for Oct. 1.
   Sept. 24 - U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood orders pre-sentencing
memorandums released to the public because of the enormous interest
in the case. Federal prosecutors urge her to give Milken a severe
punishment, based partly on crimes Milken hasn't admitted. Defense
attorneys ask Wood to consider only the six charges in his guilty
plea and urge her to sentence him to community service.
   Sept. 27 - Wood delays Milken's sentencing to hold an
extraordinary two-week hearing in mid-October to consider the
government's array of unproven charges against him. She says the
purpose of the hearing is to gain a greater insight into Milken's
character in order to fashion a fair sentence.

<HEAD>Gold, Energy Futures Slide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices followed energy prices in an upward spiral
Friday but slipped late in the day amid signs the government is
trying to halt runaway speculation that produced a volatile week on
the commodity and stock markets.
   Gold settled $3.30 to $2.50 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in September at $402.50 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures showed signs of breaking the $40-a-barrel barrier
once again Friday, but fell in the last hour of trading after the
House OK'd plans to ``test'' release 15 million gallons of crude
from the strategic oil reserves.
   Light sweet crude oil settled 3 cents lower to 45 cents higher
with November at $39.51 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent lower to
.61 cent higher with October at $1.0498 a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .97 cent to .24 cent lower with October at $1.0176 a gallon.
   Optimism that a federal budget compromise will be reached over
the weekend and speculation that President Bush was prepared to
take unspecified action should crude top $40 also contributed to
the turnaround, analysts said.
   On other commodity markets, silver and platinum extended their
losses; soybean futures prices slipped; grains were mixed;
livestock futures were mixed; and pork futures were higher.
   Platinum rallied from an opening low on the New York Mercantile
Exchange and settled $3.70 to $4.20 lower with October at $433.10 a
troy ounce. Silver settled 2.5 cents to 1 cent lower on the
Commodity Exchange with October at $4.761 an ounce.
   Soybean futures fell and grains were mixed during a day of thin,
quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Soybeans opened with early support following yesterday's
after-closing release of the Agriculture Department's quarterly
report on the estimated stockpile of grains in the United States.
But that support quickly eroded amid pressure from the upcoming
expected better-than-normal harvest and little export demand,
analysts said.
   Traders had expected slight gains in the soybean and grain
markets but were surprised by lackluster trading, said David
Armstrong, an analyst for AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington.
   ``The (USDA) report obviously wasn't enough to bring any new
buying, and there wasn't any bad news to bring a lot of selling,''
Armstrong said.
   Wheat futures also opened slightly higher but fell on
professional selling and continued questions about whether the
Soviet Union will accept a government offer to buy subsidized wheat
flour.
   Corn suffered from minimal near-term export demand and the
approach of active harvesting.
   Wheat futures settled 1\ cents lower to \ cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.77} a bushel; corn futures
were { cent lower to { cent higher with December at $2.28 a bushel;
oats were 3} cents to 5 cents higher with December at $1.21 a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to } cent lower with November at
$6.17{.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live and feeder cattle
futures prices were mixed, reflecting optimism about a federal
budget agreement.
   Live hog futures ended mostly higher as traders awaited the
after-closing release of the Agriculture Department's third-quarter
hogs and pigs report, which showed a lower-than-expected herd and
smaller numbers kept for breeding and marketing than was forecast.
   Pork bellies futures were boosted by hog futures prices and
speculation that frozen pork bellies stocks are nearly depleted,
leaving the burden of bacon demand to the fresh market.
   Live cattle settled .53 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
October at 79.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle futures were .20 cent
lower to .07 cent higher with October at 86.97 cents a pound; hogs
were .05 cent lower to .97 cent higher with October at 54.82 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .97 cent higher with
February at 58.20 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. plans to unveil a product Tuesday it
calls its most important development since it introduced the modern
copying machine 31 years ago.
   The new device is a combination copier, fax, image scanner and
document printer designed to tie together these now-separate
operations at large companies.
   Using the machine, a worker could push a button on his desktop
computer and order up one - or several hundred - high-quality,
bound copies of a 50-page report. He also could send a fax of a
computer document to another computer user, industry analysts say.
   In addition, the machine could electronically ``scan in'' paper
documents that then could be stored in a computer or manipulated on
a computer screen.
   ``It's really meant to bring the copier into the computer
network,'' said Ann Palermo, an analyst at the market research firm
International Data Corp.
   The device is considered a gamble by Xerox, which has been
disappointed in the past by making technological breakthroughs only
to lose the market for them to other companies.
   ``They have spent a fortune on the development of this system,''
said Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. He said
the research cost ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   ``The people that have seen it are very impressed,'' he said.
But, he added, the market potential for the device - expected to
cost at least $200,000 - is uncertain.
   ``They're trying to create a market, and the question is, can
they create it at that price,'' said Peter Enderlin, an analyst at
Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
   Added Glazer, ``They'll be introducing it into a difficult
economic environment, where the budgets of potential user
organizations will be under constraints.''
   Xerox wouldn't discuss details of the product, but it called a
news conference Tuesday in New York to make what it called its most
important announcement since it introduced the automatic, plain
paper copier in 1959.
   It did say the announcement is a follow-up to its unveiling last
month of a new personal computer and software designed to tie
together computer users throughout a company.
   Xerox apparently views the new device as a way for companies to
centralize control over the proliferation of paper and computer
documents. The machine could be another step in the long-promised
``paperless'' office since it would allow paper documents to be
stored on computers instead of in file cabinets.
   Such electronic ``imaging'' systems are offered by other
companies but have not yet found a mass market.
   Computer industry giants such as International Business Machines
Corp. and Unisys Corp. have stepped up their promotion of imaging
devices in recent months, but most are aimed at specific markets,
particularly banking.
   ``A product like this, if it's at a low enough price and has
enough features, could really help drive the growth of document
image processing,'' Enderlin said of the Xerox machine.
   Ms. Palermo said the new machine, believed to be called the
Docutech Publisher, could replace print shops at major companies.
She said high-speed printing devices used for high-quality,
multiple-copy reproduction cost about $150,000, so the anticipated
price of the Xerox machine is not out of line.
   Enderlin said investors apparently aren't excited about the
announcement. Xerox's stock price has fallen in recent weeks, as
has the market in general, since news of the machine began to
appear.
   Last month, Eastman Kodak Co. unveiled a new high-speed document
printer also designed to work with networks of desktop computers.
But the machine lacks the faxing and scanning capabilities of the
Xerox model.
   Analysts say no similar machine exists, but the most likely
potential competitor would be Kodak, along with Japanese copier
giants such as Canon.
   Xerox invented the personal computer, the ``user-friendly''
graphical software to run it and the computer control device called
the ``mouse,'' only to see them slip out of its hands and enrich
competitors who marketed them better.
   But despite the money Xerox spent on developing the new office
machine, no one is predicting the Stamford, Conn.-based company
will be hurt if it fails to catch on.
   ``The core copier business will keep going for quite a few more
years, based on replacements and the service business,'' Enderlin
said.

<HEAD>Company Spinning Off Slumping Pet Foods Division, Announces
Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whitman Corp. on Friday announced it will spin
off its slumping Pet foods division, consolidate several of its
operations and lay off about 1,000 employees.
   The company said it will take a charge against its third-quarter
earnings to pay for the spinoff and cost-cutting program, which
will cause losses for the quarter and year.
   The reorganization is an attempt by the consumer products
conglomerate to cope with lagging profitability, particularly at
its Pet specialty food unit and its Hussman Corp. division.
   ``We are taking this action because we believe it holds the best
potential for increasing shareholder value over time,'' said James
Cozad, Whitman chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``The restructuring will also produce a substantial reduction in
costs by eliminating positions throughout the organization,'' Cozad
said in a news release. ``And it will put us in a strong position
to build for the future.''
   Pet, which provides about half the company's sales and profits,
is suffering from sinking market shares and lower profit margins.
The division's reported operating income now is about 10 percent
below last year's level, Whitman said.
   Miles Marsh, Whitman president and chief operating officer, will
become chairman and CEO of Pet when it is spun off, the company
said.
   To cover the cost of the spinoff, Whitman will take a special
one-time after-tax charge against third quarter earnings of $150
million, it said. The charge will cause a ``substantial net loss''
in Whitman's third quarter and a loss for the full year, the
company said.
   About 1,000 jobs throughout Whitman's organization will be
eliminated through attrition, retirements and terminations.
   Whitman - which also owns Midas International, Pepsi-Cola
General Bottlers and the Hussmann food-equipment unit - attempted
earlier this year to sell Hussmann, but withdrew it from the market
after failing to receive high enough bids.
   Hussmann, which had a weak first half, will have operating
income down about 20 percent from last year, Whitman reported.

<HEAD>Possible Gulf War and Recession Fears Plague Commodity Markets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with Friday trading, adds weekly price trends.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy and gold futures prices soared, dipped and rose again in
a roller coaster week where Americans worried about a one-two punch
of war in the Middle East and a recession at home.
   Rumors of conflict in the Middle East ran rampant last week
through the commodity exchanges, compounding worries about signs of
a slowdown in the economy, analysts said.
   ``(Oil) seems to be the main thing the stock market and
exchanges are looking at,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, an energy analyst
with Paine Webber Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The economy is definitely weakening as a result of the sharp
increases in energy prices,'' he said. ``It certainly is going to
impede economic growth and most likely result in a recession - if
we aren't already there.''
   Gold rose on three days of war-panic buying before recession
fears sent prices spiralling downward to follow silver and
platinum, which fell to their lowest levels in years, analysts
said. Grains, soybeans and meat futures prices were mixed as
traders contented themselves with profit-taking.
   Energy prices plowed forward despite President Bush's midweek
announcement that the United States would sell 5 million barrels
from the strategic oil reserves.
   The move, widely seen as one made to calm rising fears following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, did nothing to stop light sweet
crude oil from reaching record highs. On Thursday, crude topped $40
a barrel mark for the first time before falling back.
   The contract for November delivery of crude oil on the New York
Mercantile Exchange closed down 3 cents Friday at $38.65, compared
with $35.60 a week earlier. Prices fell after reaching a high of
$39.95 late in the day after the House approved a plan for a 15
million ``test'' draw from the petroleum reserves instead of Bush's
announced 5 million-gallon draw.
   Gasoline and heating prices rose sharply throughout the week as
forecasters predicted colder than normal temperatures through
December in the Northeast and part of the Great Plains. Those areas
account for the heaviest use of fuel oil in the country.

   Silver and platinum plummeted on recession fears. The two
commodities, used mostly in industrial manufacturing, posted steep
losses despite high usage in the United States.
   Platinum, used in automobile manufacturing, fell amid reports
that the Soviet Union sold huge quantities for badly needed cash.
   Gold passed the $400 mark as traders followed energy futures,
but fell on Thursday as speculators temporarily put aside fears
over the Middle East crisis. It closed slightly higher Friday.

<HEAD>Grains and Soybeans</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures gained early in the week on the Chicago Board of
Trade amid reports that the government has offered to sell
subsidized wheat flour to the Soviet Union, Algeria and other
countries. But worries that the Soviet Union has not given a
commitment to buy and professional selling Friday pushed the crop
lower.
   Corn futures suffered thin, lackluster trading throughout the
week after forecasters predicted near-ideal temperatures in the
regions where it is grown.
   Soybeans futures were lower during the first half of the week in
advance of the Agriculture Department's release Thursday of its
quarterly grain stocks report. Prices later rallied after the USDA
reported a lower-than-expected harvest but fell again as
speculators waited for the Soviet Union to accept a government
offer to buy subsidized wheat flour.

<HEAD>Livestock and Meat</HEAD>

   Meat futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange suffered losses
early in the week amid speculation that demand for the products
will slow if the economy weakens further and the possibility that
U.S. packing plants will close in mid-October if there is failure
to reach a federal budget agreement by Monday.
   The losses gave way to cautious optimism at the week's close on
word from budget negotiators that a weekend agreement was possible.
   Here are some weekly commodity price trends:
   Grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Wheat for delivery in December settled Friday at $2.77} a
bushel, up from $2.70\ a week earlier; December corn rose to $2.28
a bushel from $2.25}; December oats rose to $1.21 a bushel from
$1.13\; November soybeans rose to $6.17{ a bushel from $6.11{.
   Cattle and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   October live cattle fell to 79.05 cents a pound from 79.57
cents; October feeder cattle rose to 89.97 cents a pound from 89.47
cents; October hogs fell to 54.82 cents a pound from 54.85 cents;
February frozen pork bellies rose to 58.20 cents a pound from 56.15
cents.
   Gold futures advance and silver futures fell on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   September gold rose to $402.50 a troy ounce from $389.40;
September silver fell to $4.76 a troy ounce from $4.79.
   Energy futures advanced on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Light, sweet crude oil for November delivery rose to $39.51 a
barrel from $35.43; wholesale October heating oil climbed to $1.05
a gallon from 97.21 cents; wholesale October unleaded gasoline rose
to $1.02 a gallon from 97.45 cents.

<HEAD>Late Rally Reverses Downward Spiral</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market staged an impressive turnaround
Friday after an intial plunge in prices lured investors from the
sidelines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been down
nearly 50 points in the early going, climbed 25.00 to close at
2,452.48. Despite the gain, the index was down nearly 60 points for
the week.
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declining ones by about 5
to 4 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 877 up, 693 down and 408 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 201.01 million
shares, up from 182.69 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 236.90 million shares.
   Trading opened on a sour note as foreign investors dumped
equities and sent prices down. With a sharp decline overnight in
Tokyo and with the first half of Japan's fiscal year drawing to a
close, many Japanese wanted to take their money home, said Michael
Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   Many analysts considered the 2,400 mark on the Dow average an
important floor. Sinking beneath that level meant the key barometer
had lost 600 points, or 20 percent in value from its peak six weeks
ago. But the decline was short-lived.
   Stocks were whipped into a late rally as cheap prices lured
buyers. ``People are really seeing cheap stocks and they're willing
to take a bit of a risk,'' said James Schroeder, an analyst with
MMS International in Chicago.
   Blue-chip issues led the advance, and the broader market joined
in shortly before the close. ``We seem to have gone from
capitulation to jubilation all in one session,'' said Eugene
Peroni, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
   Prices turned around in the financial sector, where stocks had
been hammered for days. Also serving as a supportive backdrop were
higher bond prices, little change in the price of oil, and the
expectation that lawmakers are nearing an agreement on a
deficit-reduction plan.
   Analysts were encouraged by an increase in trading activity.
With more shares changing hands, ``investors were beginning to feel
that something positive'' was under way, albeit temporary, Peroni
said.
   The picture continued to dim on the economic front. The
government said its index of leading indicators sank 1.2 percent in
August, the steepest drop in three years. The consensus is emerging
that ``we are probably in a recession,'' Oppenheimer's Metz said.
   In the banking sector, Citicorp was up { at 14\; Chase Manhattan
gained } to 11}; Bank of Boston was up } at 7~; BankAmerica was up
1 at 20\; J.P. Morgan jumped 2&lsqb; to 32~, and Chemical Bank was up 1&rsqb;
at 15{.
   Among other actively traded Big Board issues, Unisys, which is
eliminating its dividend, lost &rsqb; to 5; General Electric rose 2~ to
54{; Philip Morris rose 1\ to 45\; Wal Mart was up ~ at 27\, and
the Limited rose ~ to 13}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $38.97 billion, or 1.37
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.49 to 167.85.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index added 5.37 to 360.47, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index stood at 306.05, up 5.08.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
3.32 to 344.51. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 307.72, up 2.29.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Little Changed After Volatile Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices closed little changed Friday in a
quiet yet volatile session Friday. Traders saw evidence that
President Bush's attempt to calm the energy markets was having some
effect.
   The November contract for delivery of light, sweet crude fell 3
cents to $39.51 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after trading as high as $39.95 a barrel and falling as
low as $38.65. Later contract months closed narrowly higher.
   There was no news directly from the Middle East to influence
trading, but the House voted during the afternoon to triple to 15
million barrels the amount of oil the government can remove from
the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The vote was expected by
the market, but still had a sobering effect on trading.
   Also putting a damper on prices was speculation that the New
York Merc would increase its margin requirements to limit the
amount of money traders could borrow to purchase oil contracts.
   Such a move would drive speculative traders out, reduce the
volatility in the market and force prices down, said Nauman
Barakat, a senior trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Despite such bearish news, prices did not fall sharply Friday
because they were supported by buying from traders afraid events
over the weekend might send prices down further, said Jim Fiedler,
an energy market analyst with E. D. &amp; F. Man International Futures
Inc.
   Bush's decision Wednesday to tap 5 million barrels from the 590
million-barrel oil reserve was having some of the calming effect on
the market that the president sought, analysts said.
   Prices responded only briefly on Thursday to his decision, but
analysts saw more of a reaction Friday.
   Although the president cannot control what happens in a free
market, ``there's a general feeling that Bush is putting quite a
bit of political pressure on the industry to keep the price below
$40,'' said Fiedler, noting that Bush has pressured oil companies
in the past to keep prices down.
   ``Bush is saying, `Read my lips, I want crude to stay below
$40,''' Fiedler said.
   Oil prices did cross the $40-a-barrel mark briefly Thursday but
fell back. The October contracts for refined petroleum products
expired Friday, causing some volatility, but as in the market for
crude, trading was dominated by concerns about the Middle East.
   Home heating oil for October delivery rose 0.61 cent to $1.0498
a gallon, and subsequent months also advanced. Seasonal factors
also contributed to heating oil's gains, as demand for oil rises in
the fall.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline futures declined, also influenced by
seasonal factors - the end of the summer driving season. October
gasoline dropped 0.93 cent to $1.0176 a gallon. Later months also
declined.
   In natural gas trading, the November contract fell to $1.935 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.940 on Thursday.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Climb as Market Anticipates Budget Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury bond prices climbed Friday as the
market anticipated an imminent agreement on the federal budget and
traders saw another sign of increasing economic weakness.
   The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond rose 23-32 point, or
$7.19 for every $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when
the price goes up, dropped to 8.94 percent from 9.02 percent late
Thursday.
   Bond traders believed congressional negotiators would reach a
budget agreement by the deadline Sunday night, the end of the 1990
fiscal year, said Terrence Doyle, a trader with Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co.
   For weeks, the bond market has anticipated that a federal budget
agreement could lead the Federal Reserve to allow interest rates to
fall. Lower rates benefit fixed-return investments such as bonds.
   Bond prices also were supported Friday by a sign of growing
weakness in the nation's economy, traders said. Signs of a souring
economy also raise hopes that the Fed will ease interest rates.
   The government reported that its chief economic gauge, the index
of leading economic indicators, fell 1.2 percent in August the wake
of the Persian Gulf crisis. In was the steepest drop in three years
in the index, designed to forecast economic activity six to nine
months in advance.
   Bond prices also were boosted in the morning by a drop in stock
prices, but the stock market later reversed direction.
   Market watchers said another positive influence on bond prices
was investors buying back borrowed bonds they had sold short. Bonds
are sold short in anticipation that their price will drop;
investors apparently believed a budget over the weekend would send
prices higher Monday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, short-term
issues gained 1-16 point to 9-32 point, intermediate maturities
rose 9-32 point to 23-32 point, and long-term issues jumped 21-32
point to 23-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, advanced 3.77 to 1,146.55.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills sank to 7.34 percent as the
discount dropped 9 basis points to 7.12 percent. Yields on
six-month bills tumbled to 7.51 percent as the discount dropped 4
basis points to 7.15 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.67
percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 7.16 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another
for overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, down from 8 1-16
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 3-16 point to 88 7-32. The average
yield to maturity fell to 7.79 percent from 7.81 percent late
Thursday.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday reinstated a
lawsuit that accuses two corporations of making illegal foreign
payments to obtain price breaks on Venezuelan tobacco.
   Billy Lamb and Carmon Willis, who grow tobacco in Kentucky, in
August 1985 sued Philip Morris Inc. of New York and B.A.T.
Industries PLC of London.
   They allege a 1982 agreement by the two companies to make
periodic donations to a Venezuelan children's foundation violated
U.S. antitrust law. They said the payments were made in exchange
for price controls on Venezuelan tobacco and elimination of
controls on that nation's retail cigarette prices.
   Lamb and Willis said the payments were promised by Philip Morris
subsidiary known as C.A. Tabacalera National and a B.A.T.
subsidiary called C.A. Cigarrera Bigott.
   A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Friday reversed a decision by U.S. District Judge Scott Reed of
Lexington, Ky., to dismiss the suit. The appeals panel sent the
case back to Reed.
   Lamb and Willis have asked for a court order blocking the
companies' arrangements with Venezuela. They said the agreements
would hurt U.S. tobacco growers by artificially depressing market
prices and ensuring lucrative retail prices for tobacco products
sold abroad.
   Robert Watt III, a Lexington lawyer representing Philip Morris,
said he hadn't seen Friday's ruling and couldn't comment.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The House voted to give President Bush
authority to triple the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil sale he
announced Wednesday, but a White House spokesman said he has no
intention of doing so.
   On a voice vote Friday with no dissent, the House raised to 15
million barrels the ceiling on test sales from the government
stocks after Energy Secretary James Watkins told lawmakers Thursday
a 5 million-barrel test was inadequate.

   PARIS (AP) - The International Energy Agency advised Western
nations to brace for a possible oil shortage but said there was no
immediate need to tap strategic reserves to offset the loss of oil
from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Echoing the conclusions drawn at a meeting last month, the
group's governing board said in a comunique Friday that rising oil
price rises were driven by ``extreme political uncertainty,'' not
short supplies.
   Supplies lost due to the embargo on Kuwait and Iraq's oil have
been offset by increased production by other nations, it said, and
oil markets remain adequately supplied.

plans to transform 550 armament factories to civilian production,
his spokesman said.
   Gorbachev and top aides met Friday to complete the conversion
plan as representatives of seven Soviet republics agreed to bypass
central authorities in working out a new system of economic and
political cooperation.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament has been unable to pass a cohesive
reform plan, and on Monday granted Gorbachev extraordinary powers
to transform the national economy from a planned to a market
system.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - California adopted strict auto emission rules
to compel production of a new generation of ultra-clean cars and
fuels, toughening the strictest air quality controls in the nation.
   The effort, announced Friday, is an attempt to grapple with
California's enormous dilemma: some of the worst air pollution in
the nation, a population of 30 million people, 22 million vehicles
on the road and few mass-transit alternatives.

   CHICAGO (AP) - Whitman Corp. announced it will spin off its
slumping Pet foods division, consolidate several of its operations
and lay off about 1,000 employees.
   The company said Friday it will take a charge against its
third-quarter earnings to pay for the program, which will cause
losses for the quarter and year. The reorganization is an attempt
by the consumer products conglomerate to cope with lagging
profitability.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Plans to rescue two United Mine Workers health
care funds, now staggering under an $88 million deficit, are
stirring anxiety among non-union coal operators.
   The operators fear a new industry-wide coal tax will be proposed
to bail out the troubled 1950 and 1974 UMW health benefit trusts,
which serve 127,052 retired union miners, widows and dependents.
   In March, U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole appointed an
11-member commission to study the trusts. The panel, which has no
lawmaking power, will release its recommendations at two meetings,
scheduled for Oct. 11 and Oct. 17. ---
   LONDON (AP) - Stockholders of British insurance broker Willis
Faber PLC approved a merger worth more than $750 million with New
York-based broker Corroon &amp; Black Corp.
   The merging companies also reached a final settlement Friday
with dissident U.S. shareholders.
   Willis Faber said Corroon &amp; Black shareholders will vote on the
proposed merger Oct. 8. The stock of the merged companies would
begin trading the next day, Willis Faber said.

   An attempt by President Bush to calm the oil
markets failed and prices for crude passed $40 a barrel for the
first time.
   Bush's announcement Wednesday that the government would sell 5
million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve was overshadowed by antagonistic statements from Iraq and
reports that an American warship fired across the bow of an Iraqi
tanker.
   The November contract for light, sweet crude rose 87 cents
Thursday to settle at $39.54 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange after trading as high as $40.10.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A judge put off the final chapter of Wall
Street's worst scandal, delaying the sentencing of Michael Milken
to allow time for an unusual hearing on other alleged crimes by the
junk-bond financier.
   The surprise ruling Thursday by U.S. District Judge Kimba M.
Wood followed by a day the release of a pre-sentencing memo from
prosecutors that urged a stiff sentence on the basis of a broad
array of wrongdoing.
   The judge was scheduled to pronounce punishment for Milken
Monday. He faces a maximum 28 years imprisonment after pleading
guilty to six felonies in April.

   DANBURY, Conn. (AP) - Union Carbide Corp. said it would sell
some assets and reorganize one of its principle subsidiaries under
a restructuring expected to produce $600 million in after-tax
proceeds.
   The plan, announced Thursday, calls for the chemical company to
sell up to half the equity in one subsidiary, while selling off its
interest in two businesses and restructuring its industrial gases
business. It also includes buying back up to 14 percent of its
common stock.
   About half the proceeds would be used to reduce debt.

   DENVER (AP) - President Bush's son Neil testified he was a
``go-between'' for a controversial line of credit extended by the
failed thrift where he was a director. But he insisted his actions
involved no conflict.
   Bush was testy at times as he testified Thursday on the third
day of a hearing on the government's conflict-of-interest
allegations against him.
   Bush was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association, which collapsed in 1988 at an estimated cost to
taxpayers of $1 billion.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Regulators learned the government fund
protecting bank accounts is dwindling faster than thought only two
months ago, and they voted a 1991 increase of more than 60 percent
on the deposit insurance premiums charged banks.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s bank fund dropped from
$13.2 billion at the end of last year to $11.4 billion at the end
of June - a 14 percent decline.
   ---
   NEW YORK (AP) - Bank customers could pay higher fees or receive
lower interest on their savings to help make up for the increase in
bank insurance premiums mandated by regulators, industry analysts
said.
   The insurance increase also could reduce profits in an
already-troubled industry, the analysts said Thursday. But they
added that the higher premiums were necessary to ensure the health
of the banking system.

   LONDON (AP) - Laura Ashley, hailed as a great British retailing
success story until falling on hard times, said it will sell or

an effort to survive.
   The retailer of English country-style women's clothing and home
furnishings operates nearly 500 stores worldwide, 185 of them in
the United States.
   The company said Thursday it would largely abandon manufacturing
its own apparel because it can be bought much more cheaply from
outside suppliers.

   MOSCOW (AP) - President Mikhail S. Gorbachev began using his
sweeping new powers to rescue the collapsing Soviet economy,
ordering businesses to fulfill supply contracts and the government
to ensure distribution.
   But it was far from clear that people would comply with his
order Thursday. Many are uncertain how they will fit in the market
economy Gorbachev is trying to establish and they find it more
profitable to trade goods on the black market, rather than
distribute them in the established structure.

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - The Persian Gulf crisis and its negative
impact on East European economies has sent the Viennese stock
market into a tailspin, after two years of outperforming other
European bourses.
   From an all-time high of 739.21 points on March 13, the

   A federal judge has delayed sentencing Michael
Milken until she holds an extraordinary inquiry based on a broad
array of unproven charges against the fallen junk-bond financier.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said in her surprise ruling
Thursday that the purpose of the hearing, which lawyers called a
first in a white-collar crime case, would be to gain a greater
understanding of Milken, described as a conniving crook by
prosecutors and a contrite philanthropist by his defense.
   The judge had been scheduled to pronounce Milken's sentence
Monday, closing a major chapter in Wall Street's worst scandal. He
faces a maximum 28 years imprisonment after pleading guilty to six
felonies in April.
   But as the judgment day approached, federal prosecutors sought
to persuade Wood that Milken's crimes are far more extensive and
should be taken into account as she deliberates his punishment.
Defense attorneys argued she should sentence Milken only on the
charges he's admitted.
   Wood said in ordering the sentencing hearing that it would be
held for approximately two weeks sometime next month and structured
to allow each side to present testimony and evidence supporting
their positions.
   Federal law allows her to consider any information about a
defendant in determining an appropriate sentence.
   Her ruling immediately raised the prospect of an unofficial
trial for Milken, extending what his lawyers called a painful
ordeal for the fallen pioneer of high-yield bond trading at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   ``I was hoping we could dispense with this,'' his lead attorney
Arthur Liman said. Such a hearing, he told the judge, could
``prolong an extraordinary anguish and agony for my client's
family.''
   On the other hand, the hearing could provide an opportunity for
Milken's defense team to at last confront Ivan F. Boesky, the
convicted speculator who first implicated Milken in a maze of
financial corruption in 1986.
   ``I'll finally get to try this case after four years,'' Liman
told reporters later outside the courtroom.
   The judge tentatively scheduled a conference between the
prosecutors and Milken's lawyers Tuesday to further define the
extent of the hearing. It was unclear when Milken would be
sentenced.
   Wood made her decision after reading voluminous pre-sentencing
memorandums from both the prosecution and defense. She ordered them
released this week in censored form, deleting incriminating
references to Milken associates.
   The judge also has received hundreds of letters both supporting
and denouncing Milken, by far the biggest figure to fall in the
Wall Street securities fraud scandal that has snared a number of
white-collar executives.
   Wood, who at 46 is the youngest judge in the Manhattan federal
court, has proceeded with extreme caution in the Milken case, her
first nationally prominent sentencing decision since she was
appointed two years ago. Lawyers said her ruling Thursday reflected
this concern.
   ``She wants to give both sides an opportunity to explore matters
in their sentencing memorandums,'' said Ira L. Sorkin, a prominent
securities attorney and former federal prosecutor. ``I think she
wants to make as complete a record as possible, because the
sentencing process is very difficult at best.''
   In what appeared to be a small victory for Milken's defense, the
judge also made it clear she has rejected an argument by
prosecutors that Milken's sentence should be longer than the
three-year term of Boesky, who pleaded guilty to a single felony
and paid $100 million in fines.
   Wood further revealed she has rejected an assertion by
prosecutors that Milken became exceedingly charitable only after
the government began investigating him. Her own probation
department report, she said, showed Milken has been charitable for
many years as the defense has argued.

   The Persian Gulf crisis and its negative
impact on East European economies has sent the Viennese stock
market into a tailspin, after two years of outperforming other
European bourses.
   From an all-time high of 739.21 points on March 13, the
exchange's Boersenkammer index slumped to a low of 464.68 this
week.
   And since Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait and sent
oil prices rocketing and international markets reeling, the index
has been Europe's worst casualty - off 35 percent.
   Vienna's bourse had seen record levels of growth for two years,
as investors were attracted by strong economic growth, low
inflation and changes in Eastern Europe.
   Daily turnover rocketed from 20 million schillings ($1.8
million) a day in early 1988 to a peak this year of 1.2 billion
schillings ($109 million).
   Some traders say prices were too high and now that world bourses
are crashing, it's not surprising Vienna was hardest hit.
   ``The market was driven up ... partly by fantasies about making
money in Eastern Europe, and Vienna was seen as the center for
that. Now that fantasy has gone,'' said one stock trader at a
leading Austrian bank, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Vienna, the old capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire, is still
considered the center of economic activity for Eastern Europe. It
has a long tradition as a hub for other major cities and regions in
the area, is centrally located and has all of the transportation
and communications links needed for business activity.
   Higher oil prices from the Gulf crisis are hitting East European
countries hard, just as they are grappling with the difficult task
of switching to freer markets.
   Romanian officials, for example, estimate the Gulf crisis has
cost their country nearly $3 billion.
   Iraq was to pay 70 percent of its $1.7 billion debt to Bucharest
in oil, but payment has been frozen. The recent rise in oil prices
to $38 a barrel will cost the economy another $770 million.
   Moscow is now selling oil at market prices for hard cash,
meaning Eastern Europe can no longer count on receiving Soviet
crude at regulated prices or in barter trade for chickens or
trucks.
   In Czechoslovakia, gasoline prices have risen 50 percent this
year, mainly because the Soviets slashed crude supplies by 15
percent. Hungary has also upped prices after Moscow interrupted
supplies.
   Some analysts noted that investors had begun losing interest in
Eastern Europe even before the Gulf crisis.
   ``People had already begun to realize after initial euphoria
that profits wouldn't be flowing so ast out of the East,'' said
Josef Oswald, chief analyst at Creditanstalt bank.
   But he stressed that Austria's economic growth, at 4.5 percent
this year and a likely 3.75 percent to 4 percent in 1991, is still
stronger than the European average. Inflation is only at 3.2
percent.

   A bumper vegetable crop is rotting in the fields
as the first fall frost approaches, and Muscovites fearing a hungry
winter have joined soldiers and schoolchildren trying to rescue
potatoes.
   Some people have become so desperate they are stealing potatoes,
carrots, pickles and preserves from individually owned vegetable
cellars in the villages surrounding Moscow, Soviet media report.
   The Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper quoted one elderly Russian
peasant woman as saying: ``If my memory doesn't fail me, that only
happened before the famine of '47. ... Alas, this is a really bad
sign.''
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov admits that, at best, only
one-third of the vegetable crop has been harvested so far, and
Soviet media said Thursday only a fraction of that has made its way
to Moscow warehouses and markets.
   ``A hungry winter is coming,'' the official Tass news agency
predicted. ``It is unprecedented in the history of the Soviet Union
in the last week of September that only 3.7 percent of the potatoes
needed for Moscow this winter are in storage in the city.''
   Potatoes are a mainstay of the Soviet diet, known as ``second
bread'' after the other staple that also was in short supply this
summer for the first time since the early 1960s.
   ``If potatoes disappear from the counter, this will be a
catastrophe for the pensioners, students and poor people,''
Komsomolskaya Pravda said.
   The Soviet Union annually loses 20 percent to 30 percent of its
food harvest on the way to market. This year's problems have been
compounded by bad weather and fuel shortages for farm machinery.
   Moscow-area farms have been drenched with twice the average
rainfall in the first two weeks of September, and farmers complain
their antiquated harvesting machines no longer work in the muddy
fields.
   Students and soldiers were drafted into the harvest weeks ago,
and last week leaders of Moscow's regional government invited city
dwellers to go to collective and state farms to dig potatoes for
their own use.
   In an indication how desperate the situation has become, Defense
Minister Dmitri Yazov told the Soviet legislature on Wednesday that
23,000 soldiers based in the Moscow region are helping to dig
potatoes.
   Individuals are entitled to keep every sixth sack of potatoes
they dig, or pay about 20 cents per pound for their entire bounty.
   ``Two more weeks of such weather and the whole (potato) crop
will perish,'' said the head of the Moscow regional government
department responsible for vegetable and fruit production.
   ``It has been under water for two months already and it is
becoming rotten. ... Not only combines but also digging machines
can't move along the fields, so the only two instruments we have
are hands and shovel,'' the official, L. Yegan, told Moskovksy
Komsomolets newspaper.
   He said at least three days of clear weather followed by two
weeks without heavy rain were needed to salvage the harvest,
``otherwise we can cross it out.''
   The Council of Ministers, the Soviet Cabinet, adopted a
resolution on Tuesday to step up the harvest effort. It said bad
weather, poor management, lack of discpline and lack of cooperation
between urban and rural governments had created ``a real threat
that a sizeable part of the harvest may be lost.''
   The resolution would send blue- and white-collar workers to work
on farms, even if it meant the suspension of some urban businesses
and further enlistment of armed forces' help in harvesting and
transportation. The resolution also directed police to step up
anti-profiteering and anti-sabotage efforts. It was not clear when
the resolution would take effect.
   The Dmitrov City Council near Moscow took an even more drastic
step, declaring a state of emergency. It ordered at least 20
percent of factory workers, at least half the scientific workers
and up to 70 percent of administrators and its own executive
committee workers to assist the harvest.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Won't Affect Coal Demand For A While</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There aren't many opportunities left to expand
coal use, despite the increased demand placed on oil since Saddam
Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, analysts say.
   Coal boomed in the 1970s partly because utilities used it to
wean themselves from a dependence on foreign oil. Utilities spent
millions to convert power plants from burning oil to coal.
   Mansions and Mercedes appeared in Appalachian coalfields as mine
owners profited from the rapid demand.
   But the bonanza is over. The big conversion to coal has already
taken place, and short-term growth prospects now look dim in both
the domestic and export markets. While oil prices have soared since
the Aug. 2 invasion, coal has been steady.
   ``Nothing's going to happen here for a six- to nine-month period
because of Iraq,'' said Joel Price, coal analyst for Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette.
   He and other industry observers listed several reasons why coal
hasn't been affected by the Gulf crisis:
  - Coal barely competes with oil as a domestic energy source.
During the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, oil generated nearly 17 percent
of the nation's electricity. Now it provides only 4 percent to 5
percent. In the same period, coal's share grew 10 percent to about
56 percent of the nation's electric output, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration.
   - No sudden demand for coal is forecast at home. Utilities burn
about 80 percent of all coal mined in America and there's a surplus
of coal on the market. Utilities aren't expected to convert the few
existing oil-fired plants to burn coal, said Price and others.
   ``There isn't much room for oil to be backed out further,'' said
John Grasser, spokesman for the National Coal Association in
Washington. Utilities probably will switch to clean-burning natural
gas to meet sudden demand.
   - Sudden growth in exports has not occurred.
   ``There is not much movement at all in terms of requests for
greater tonnages or a run-up in prices,'' said Thomas Hoffman, vice
president of public relations for Consolidation Coal Co. Inc. in
Pittsburgh. Consol is a large exporter.
   United States coal companies hope to sell more coal to European
utilities with universal boilers, which burn either coal, oil or
natural gas. The U.S. exported about 10 percent of its coal
production last year.
   ``Overseas, there is some chance if (war) breaks out, you might
see coal take the place of some of the residual oil in Europe,''
said Chuck Linderman, manager of fossil fuels program for Edison
Electric Institute in Washington.
   Spot market prices for coal have stayed steady and in some cases
declined since the Aug. 2 invasion. That reflects an oversupply in
the market that's existed for several years.
   ``We have had the capacity for years to produce more coal than
what the market demanded,'' said Tom Duncan, Kentucky Coal
Association president.
   Price said rising oil prices, however, will affect the coal
industry eventually. Mine owners will have to pay more for diesel
and transportation costs will rise. Spot market prices will rise to
reflect these costs, he predicted.
   And coal will suffer, not profit, if the Gulf crisis brings on a
recession, Price added. Plant closings or large layoffs among U.S.
manufacturers will reduce demand for electricity, and a drop in
power demand will cause a drop in the need for coal, said Price.
   Coal's promise lies in the long term.
   Marc Cohen, coal analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York,
predicted that utilities looking for new power sources will seek
coal over generating stations, oil, nuclear and hydroelectric
power.
   ``When you have new baseload growth, coal once again will be the
dominant kid on the block,'' he said.
   The pending Clean Air Act legislation has placed low sulfur coal
in high demand as utilities try to meet the tough new air pollution
regulations. The Powder River Basin in Wyoming and portions of
central Appalachia will see job growth as low sulfur production
picks up.
   Thousands of workers in high sulfur coal mines in the Illinois
basin will be sent packing because of the new environmental rules,
the Environmental Protection Agency says.
   Others see coal fueling future modes of transportation, such as
electric trolleys and electric cars.
   ``The only real area where coal could make the most inroads is
the sector that uses the most oil, and that's the transportation
sector,'' said John Grasser, spokesman for the National Coal
Association in Washington.

<HEAD>Bank Customers Could Pay More To Cover Deposit Insurance Hike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Customers may wind up paying the cost of higher
deposit insurance premiums as banks, already struggling to hold on
to profits, pass along the added costs, industry analysts said.
   The board of directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
voted Thursday to boost the premium banks pay by more than 60
percent starting next year to shore up the deposit insurance
system.
   The FDIC took the action after learning that the government fund
protecting bank accounts dropped from $13.2 billion at the end of
last year to $11.4 billion at the end of June, a 14 percent
decline.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said in Washington that he now
expects by the end of the year the fund will have lost ``closer to
$3 billion'' rather than the $2 billion he earlier predicted.
   Under the premium increase, banks will pay the FDIC 19.5 cents
in insurance for each $100 in deposits. Currently, they pay 12
cents per $100 in deposits.
   The insurance increase could reduce profits in an
already-troubled industry, analysts said Thursday. But they added
that the higher premiums were necessary to ensure the health of the
banking system.
   ``The FDIC needs the money,'' said Christopher Mahoney, an
analyst at Moody's Investors Service. ``The soundness of the FDIC
is important.''
   Analysts believe many banks will try to pass on to customers
some of the premium increase in the form of higher fees for
checking accounts, bounced checks and other services. Banks also
may try to lower the interest they pay on savings accounts,
certificates of deposit and other investments.
   If banks were to pass on to savings account customers the full
7.5 cent increase, a customer with $10,000 in his account would
lose $7.50 in interest over a year, before compounding.
   But such moves could be met with resistance and loss of
customers, analysts said.
   ``It's pretty hard to gouge the customer when the customer has
other alternatives,'' said Eric Hemel of the investment firm First
Boston Corp. He said savers could put their money in mutual funds
or other investments, or switch banks.
   That means banks may be forced to absorb some or all of the
insurance increase, which could affect their earnings and be
especially troubling to weaker institutions.
   ``Revenues at banks are not growing robustly, so any increase in
expenses is going to hurt,'' said Cheryl Swaim of the investment
firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co. She estimated the higher premiums could
lower overall bank profits by 2 percent to 3 percent.
   Ms. Swaim said most banks do not disclose the percentage of
their expenses composed of FDIC fees, but one that does, First
Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem, N.C., said its FDIC cost was 3
percent of its expenses.
   ``It's not ahuge chunk,'' she said. But ``for the banks that
aren't earning much money it's going to be a higher percentage of
their earnings.''
   The insurance increase could push barely profitable banks into
the red. In fact, the FDIC calculated that if the 1991 rate had
been in effect last year, 69 banks would have recorded losses
instead of profits and four additional banks would have failed.
   The American Bankers Association believes the increase also
could lower the amount of money banks have available to make loans,
said spokeswoman Ginnie Dean.
   She said the trade association supports the increase as a
necessary step, but believes changes in the FDIC insurance program
are needed. Insurance increases could be counterproductive in the
long run because of their potential to make more banks
unprofitable, she added.
   First Boston's Hemel said concern about the latest FDIC
insurance increase overlooks the bigger picture of what future
increases may be needed to bail out troubled banks as the economy
weakens. He thinks future hikes could be much larger than the 1991
increase.
   The prices of many bank stocks tumbled Thursday, but analysts
said it was due mostly to trouble reported by several major banks
in recent days, not to the insurance increase.
   On Thursday, Bank of Boston said it expected to report a loss
this quarter and would reduce its quarterly dividend by two-thirds.
   On Wednesday, NCNB Corp., a bank based in Charlotte, N.C., said
it would report sharply lower earnings this quarter and would
increase its reserves for potentially bad loans.

<HEAD>Enforcement Bill Increasing SEC Powers Clears Senate</HEAD>

   The Senate has unanimously passed more stock
market reform legislation, this time giving the Securities and
Exchange Commission authority to impose more fines and crack down
on penny stock abuses.
   The Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act increases SEC powers
to protect small investors against penny stock fraud.
   An earlier Senate version did not contain a penny stock
provision, but was similar in most other ways to the Securities
Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act passed by the House on July
23.
   The new bill will give the SEC the authority to bar crooked
promoters and consultants from selling penny stocks, highly
speculative securities that sell for a few dollars or less.
   While not illegal, penny stocks are prone to fraud and are
considered to be very risky at best.
   The bill also would tighten disclosure requirements for some
types of penny stocks.
   ``This legislation will add new weapons to the arsenal of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to combat illegal activity in
our securities markets,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who
introduced the bill with Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., last year at the
request of the SEC.
   The legislation also would:
   - give the SEC the power to order alleged wrongdoers to ``cease
and desist'' illegal activities without first having to go to court
and obtain a restraining order;
   - widen SEC authority to seek court orders barring convicted
securities law violators from serving as officers or directors of
companies with publicly-traded stock;
   - enact numerous reforms in the selling of penny stocks, highly
speculative securities that sell for a few dollars or less;
   - authorize new civil penalties for securities violators of up
to $100,000 per violation for an individual and up to $500,000 for
companies and other entities.
   Previously, the SEC had the power to impose fines only in
insider trading cases. For other violations such as fraudulent
sales techniques, the agency had no mid-level sanction. It could
only enjoin violators from repeating their activities or revoke
their license, which some have called the regulatory equivalent of
the death penalty.
   Thursday's vote follows Senate approval of another reform bill
Tuesday that will allow the SEC to regulate the controversial
computerized strategy of program trading in times of extreme market
turbulence. That bill also would give the SEC authority to monitor
large stock trades and the parent holding companies of brokerages.
It would also allow the agency to close the markets - with the
president's approval - in market emergencies.
   ``Tuesday's reforms will help curb market volatility to keep our
stock markets safe for individual investors,'' said Sen. Donald
Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
``Today, we gave the SEC added tools to police our markets and keep
them safe from crooks.''

<HEAD>Pickens Partnership Settles SEC, Shareholder Lawsuits for $7.2
Million</HEAD>

   Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Limited
Partnership has agreed to pay a of $7.2 million to settle two
civil lawsuits, including one by federal regulators alleging
securities law violations.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Pickens and Mesa for
allegedly selling stock in a mining company after his announced
plans to acquire it drove up the share price.
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Pickens and Mesa
Limited Partnership, a Dallas energy concern, agreed to settle with
the SEC Thursday. Mesa agreed to put $2.3 million in alleged
illegal profits into a fund to reimburse other investors.
   In another development, Mesa announced it had agreed to pay $4.9
million to settle a 6-year-old class action lawsuit brought by
Phillips Petroleum Co. shareholders against Mesa and Phillips.
   Mesa, Phillips and other defendants agreed to pay a total $6.7
million to settle the suit brought by shareholders unhappy with how
Phillips headed off a takeover bid by Pickens. That settlement is
subject to a judge's approval at federal court in Delaware.
   In 1984, Mesa offered $60 a share in cash for up to 23 million
of Phillips' 154.6 million outstanding common shares, and was
considering further shareholder enticements when it dropped the bid
in an agreement with Bartlesville, Okla.-based Phillips.
   Under the agreement, Mesa said it would sell back its 8.9
million shares of Phillips stock to the company for $53 a share in
cash, giving Mesa a pretax profit of $89 million.
   In some quarters, this is considered greenmail, where a party
threatens a takeover but profits from forcing the company to buy
back its stock at a premium. This kind of behavior earned Pickens,
who also launched unsuccessful bids against Unocal Corp. and Gulf
Corp., the reputation of corporate raider.
   In a statement, Mesa said it still denies it violated any laws
but ``the risk and expense of litigation make this settlement an
appropriate resolution of these issues.''
   A spokesman for Pickens in Washington said ``in both cases Boone
wanted to get these lawsuits behind him so he could concentrate on
the energy market.''
   The spokesman, Mark Helmke, denied that the SEC lawsuit had
anything to do with Pickens stepping down earlier this month as
head of the United Shareholders Association, a grassroots
investors' rights group he founded in 1986.
   ``There's no linkage at all. Boone just wanted to broaden the
base of USA,'' said Helmke.
   Charles Cox, a former SEC commissioner, was named to succeed
Pickens at USA.
   The SEC's civil complaint, filed at federal court in Texas,
charged Pickens and Mesa with alleged securities law violations
involving the sale of common stock and call options of Homestake
Mining Inc., a San Francisco gold mining company which is publicly
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Call options give an investor the right - but not the obligation
- to buy shares at a fixed price at a later date. They are used in
trading strategies betting that a stock's price will rise.
   The SEC claimed that Mesa issued a news release that was
``materially false or misleading'' about its intentions to acquire
Homestake without revealing that it also intended to sell Homestake
shares it already held.
   SEC regulations require anyone holding 5 percent or more of a
company's shares to disclose it. At the time, Mesa only had a 3.8
percent stake, some 3.5 million shares.
   The SEC charged that on Feb. 29, 1988, Mesa issued a press
release stating its intentions to acquire Homestake in a negotiated
transaction. The market price of Homestake's shares rose nearly $4
per share to more than $18 on the news.
   That same day, Mesa began selling Homestake shares without
updating the press release.
   Between that day and March 11, Mesa sold more than 3.3 million
shares of Homestake stock and 3,331 Homestake call options.
   The SEC complaint alleged that ``as a result of the failure to
state all facts necessary'' to update the press release, Mesa and
Pickens violated federal securities laws.
